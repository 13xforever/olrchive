00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, February 8th, 2009, will Netflix on the 360 get a premium upgrade,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Time Crisis debuts on the iPhone,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and is President Obama a new character in Street Fighter?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Here I am, Rob Roberts, with you every week, and also joining us, say hello to the one and only,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Back from her gray, wait, we didn't hear you, is the mic on?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is now! Alright, there we go, back from the dead to join us here on Orange Lounge Radio

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
because she's been out a couple weeks. It was gray, very gray.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh yeah, you went to Prosser, Washington, Party Central America, how was that?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I went roller skating.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
People did roller skating to be cool like 20 years ago.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I love roller skating, but I found out something very depressing, Rob.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's that? Since I had, the last time I went roller skating was four years ago,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I went with Jessica, of all people.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oddly enough, having two car accidents where your hip gets injured means it's really hard to roller skate.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Especially when you're going one way and you're having to balance with your right leg and it hurts and ow.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Ow. So yeah, I murdered myself.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I played lots of stuff.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We'll talk about that in just a minute, but I have to introduce everybody else who's here.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi. Hi, how are you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm doing fine.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah? Fine?

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, I was in Oakland all day, so you can't really recover from it.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And you didn't get shot?

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't get shot.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Congratulations.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright, we are very excited tonight here because if we sound giddy, it's because finally after like six weeks of being gone,

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we're finally back on Justin TV.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So hi to everybody who's watching us there on Justin TV.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Justin TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Though again, I don't know why people want to watch us doing a radio show, but people seem to want to do it.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But the reason why I'm giddy is because the audio now works.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And let me explain how this works real quick.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The audio now works that they hear us through the mics.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So the sound quality on Justin TV during the show is a lot, lot better.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But I want to point this out.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They're not going to hear the music or anything else.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They're not going to hear background music when we're doing segments like Jamie's segment.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They're not going to hear all that stuff because the way it's hooked up, only the mics feed into Justin TV.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So if you want to hear everything, you still probably want to watch Justin TV but actually listen through All Games Radio at www.allgames.com

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
where we tape every Sunday night right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's introduce other people we have in the studio tonight.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We have some very special guests tonight.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to start with this guy behind me here who has not been to the show before.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But he's someone I've kind of gotten to know a little bit recently and had listened to a few episodes of the show.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And I was like, well, why don't you come be on the show?

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So say hello to other Matt.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Matt number two.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Matt two, yes. How are you, Matt two?

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm good. How are you, Rob?

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's good to know.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So you've actually listened to a couple episodes of the show.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have. I'm not an OLR virgin.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And you weren't freaked out.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No, not too badly.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We first met when somebody brought you over to my New Year's party.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So we kind of like were talking and found out we had some things in common and so on.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But you actually went away and listened to the show and weren't scared off.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You still are talking to me, which is awesome.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The next day I went to iTunes and I downloaded a recent podcast.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So within 24 hours I was already listening.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Very cool. Well, sucker.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Really quickly, what kind of games do you like?

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Since you've never been on the show before, we usually like to ask new people.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What kind of video games do you play, if any?

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I play a few. Mainly PC gaming for right now.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I do have an Xbox 360.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I mainly do the PC gaming.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Everything from first person shooter to MMORPGs and everything else in between.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Puzzle games, Prince of Persia, things like that.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Lately it's been WoW and Rock Band 2 have been dominating my time.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Nothing wrong with that.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Nothing wrong with that at all.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
WoW was dominating my time for a little while too.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes, but then I quit.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But then we have Rock Band 2 I play a lot of as well.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have a question for you.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you like old PC games?

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What do you mean old?

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you a fan of Loom?

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Never played Loom, but I go back as far as my online gaming experience goes back to X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter,

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
X-Wing Alliance, and organizing online gaming clans, if you will, with IRC chat

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and organizing that on the old school MSN Gaming Zone, if anyone remembers that.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Do you ever do MUDs?

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do which?

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do MUDs?

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't remember MUDs.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Old RPG stuff.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Old, old school.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Back in the day, so.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Descent, Descent was one of the first 3D games.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I remember Descent and having it over 14 floppies.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's right.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And Doom 2 had 6 floppy 3.5 inch diskettes.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Heck yeah.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I still remember all my cheat codes too.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Alright nerds, we gotta introduce somebody else who's here tonight.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's say, this is somebody you always hear a lot about, but he hasn't been on the show too many times,

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but just in time for Valentine's Day.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know what?

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm gonna let Jamie introduce tonight's special guest.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think Jamie would do a much better job introducing.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is my personal parasite.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband, Dan, is joining us tonight on the show.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Dan, how are you?

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Uh, hi.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thanks for that wonderful introduction, wife.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Dan is the king of gaming in our house.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He has more knowledge of classic games than I do.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What I want to know is how much does Dan, your husband, have in common with Dan from Street Fighter?

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Next time I want Rob to introduce me, by the way.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I love Street Fighter.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm here to talk about Street Fighter 4.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you excited about Street Fighter?

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If I had more in common with Dan Hibiki, it'd be awesome.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm not even that big of a fighting game fan, and I have kind of a semi-fanboy boner going for Street Fighter 4.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So fighting game fans must be at that point of no return right about now, because the game's about to be released.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it looks incredible.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, I can't stop watching videos.

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I prepaid for my $150 fighting stick.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh my god.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, baby.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, if you're playing it on Xbox 360, though, you kind of have to have one of those.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because I'm seriously contemplating getting it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't picture playing Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 controller.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm getting it on the PlayStation 3.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Not even just because of the controllers.

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's because I'm not going to play fighting games on live.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because online gaming is already irritating enough.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Online fighting games are the worst thing to ever happen.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And unless you like them, then hey, go for it.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And honestly, I've got to play something on my PS3.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That poor thing is lonely.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've got to introduce our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com, and they're always here to talk to us.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
By the way, I just want to say, Justin TV, you guys, we don't read the chat room over there as much because it's just too hard to look at two different chat rooms.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So please, please, if you can, join us in the other chat, chat.orangelandtrader.com.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The Rob D is in there, and he's a big fighting game fan as well.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He says, I have the collector's edition preordered.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm going crazy.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm watching the World Warrior on loop.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm watching the Street Fighter cartoon.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to watch the anime movie the night before.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Try working in a game store where we've had nothing but Street Fighter on all the demos for like a month.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What kind of game store work do you do, if you don't mind me asking?

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You don't have to say what company or whatever. I don't know what you can say or can't say, but what kind of game store stuff do you do?

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I manage a game crazy.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Anyone who's listened to this store, this show forever knows I used to manage a GameStop.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now, it's not that there's anything wrong with GameStop, other than the fact that they're corrupt and evil and hate you.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But I jumped to the other side.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So it's not that it's any different. It's just smaller and hates you less.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And I do want to point out now, tonight, we do have the whiteboard in studio.

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So we can now start, finally, our list of things that suck about GameStop.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I'm going to have Dan starting off the list tonight.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They hate you, so I'll be writing that on the whiteboard here while we get into our gaming week.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, my past two weeks of gaming have been fairly diverse.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I actually finally got past the stupid dialogue portion of Ragnarok DS and actually got to kill four porings.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Ooh. Four.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Bling, bling, bling.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's pretty fun so far. That's really cute.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Dude, how do you get to prontera? Because that was the only word I could read.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because I know some Japanese. I can't read that much Kanji.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So, oh well.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then, also, finally got through the damn forest on Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because it was exactly what I said I had to do.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
One more level and I could do it.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And then I played, we played R-Type Dimensions last night.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And I have to say that it's really, really, really freaking sweet.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Especially having unlimited content, unlimited ships.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because R-Type is like freaking hard.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's R-Type.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And this is actually harder than I remember R-Type being.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, and I wasn't really all that great at R-Type to begin with.

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But Dan and I played co-op last night and it was really fun.

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, it wasn't last night. It was the night before.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Anyway, it was really fun.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I played, I saw something that depressed me.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I saw the trailer for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's Civil War crap.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We hated it the first time, Marvel.

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Stop it.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It sucked. It was an awful storyline.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Stop it.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you hear me?

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I read your Twitters. I'll tell you all.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So anyway.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then, what else did I play?

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh yeah, I did actually play some Ragnarok Online for like, you know, an hour.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And that was it.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And I'm also, I also had a minor fan-gasm over Star Trek Online's character trailer.

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That looked hot.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Uh-huh.

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But I'm making our, when it comes out I'm making the official alien race of OLR.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The OLR-ians.

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Nice.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Seriously.

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Are they gonna be orange people?

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, probably not. Orange is a good color.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Copper.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Copper.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just, I insist I don't wear a red shirt.

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It depends though. No, no, no, no.

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you are, original Star Trek red shirt is the kiss of death.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you, in Next Generation, yellow is the kiss of death.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you're Voyager, prepare to suck.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hey now.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And if you're DS-

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I like Janeway. I'm the one.

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And if you're DS9, it's the most awesome of them all and Enterprise doesn't exist.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Because really, it's Quantum Leap the future.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Um, Trek nerds. We gotta get back to video games.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, um, um, um, um.

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Um, and, uh, I, uh, I did play something else.

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh yeah, I'm also, I think I found an MMO to play though in the meantime that's free to play.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Um, it's Perfect World.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My friend Heather plays it.

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I've seen it, it's pretty cool, so I was gonna give it a try since it's free in that World of Warcraft.

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I've never heard of Perfect World. Give us a brief description of what this is.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Um, it's not World of Warcraft.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, well then I'm sold, hey!

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's the same type of game though, but it has some pretty gorgeous environments and it's pretty cool.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And you can actually ride a tiger.

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can ride a white tiger.

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I want a white tiger.

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Can you get the eye of the tiger?

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've also decided something else completely unrelated to gaming.

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I want a pet goat.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
She doesn't even acknowledge it.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No, I'm not.

245
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I also decided that I want a pet goat while I was out of town.

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can have my sisters if you want.

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Really?

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No, she can't.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
She has four.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do they have the cool rectangular pupils?

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't care.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wait, in real life IRL she wants a goat?

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes!

254
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No, my sister-

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Where the hell are you gonna put a goat?

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In the backyard!

257
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Exac-

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hey, well, you know, my sister is looking for a place to store her four goats, so-

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I want one goat so I can walk it on a leash.

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, they suck.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What are you gonna do with a goat?

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Keep it as a pet!

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't know, you can't-

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What, are you gonna take it out and walk it around the block?

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes!

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
My sister collects animals, apparently.

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Is he gonna ride it to work?

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No, goats are too little to ride.

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They suck.

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There is nothing cool about goats.

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They just eat shit and then shit.

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, they'll eat anything, so I'll just feed it, you know, Jaguar games.

273
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's all they do.

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
They just process grass into shit.

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That is it.

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But they're cute.

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
They are not cute at all.

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They are goats.

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Dad's goats are cute.

280
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay, we're not talking about Harvest Moon here.

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And they're meat goats.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Video games!

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, your gaming week.

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was gonna say they're meat goats.

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

286
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Goat free, I hope.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes, it was goat free, thank God.

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No, this week I didn't play hardly anything other than Grand Theft Auto IV.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And I've been prepping my experience of Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC,

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
putting the right mods in place so that I can go in.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And hopefully film something funny.

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Just a little hint.

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I found a skin to reskin Nico to look like Adolf Hitler.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And let's see what else.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Some other mods that flood stuff and, you know, crazy weapons.

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So it's gonna be the wacky world of Adolf Hitler.

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Or maybe another Hitler, you know.

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hitler on Ice.

300
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hitler in the Matrix or something, I don't know.

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Anyways.

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Can I say some chat comments real quick?

303
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sure.

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because now they're on a goat kick.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Bob Coffee Away, I think, who forgot to change their name to Bob Coffee because they're obviously

306
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
there.

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Bob Coffee says, zombie goats would be the best thing ever.

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That might be like a video game involving zombie goats.

309
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, they did have Black Sheep, which was zombie sheep.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That was an awful movie.

311
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I saw that, you know, they had the trailer for that at the beginning of, what is it,

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Death Proof?

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And it was actually a real movie?

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
ActDeafedInChat says, sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell.

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I just posted a picture of the goats in chat because I love them.

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Chat.orangelandstrategy.com.

317
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, haha, Brad.

318
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
My sister seriously has her goat on her Facebook as one of her pictures.

319
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I am not kidding.

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
She has, well, she had four of them.

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think she has three now because one of them got attacked by dogs and died.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But, she has three goats.

323
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Wait!

324
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Wait, I gotta tell you, this just proves goats suck.

325
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If like a bunch of dogs can take out a goat, they're fat.

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It was a pack of dogs.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It was a pack of pit bulls.

328
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh my god.

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's a pack of angry dogs.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The coolest thing about these goats is that they have rectangular pupils.

331
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And I am obsessed with that.

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Is there a dogs who hate goats society?

333
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What is this?

334
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This is like-

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No.

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is her boyfriend's dogs actually.

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is like Animal Farm for reals.

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
They don't take care of them and they start going feral.

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So that's why they attack the goats.

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Anyways, because they're hungry.

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So, she also has a bunch of birds and hamsters and shit.

342
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So yeah, she's-

343
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
She still needs to be a veterinarian though, right?

344
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So we kinda let her get away with it.

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, but she shouldn't have goats.

346
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
She's in an apartment.

347
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
She has to store them like in Rio Linda.

348
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Which, you know, for Rio Linda, they fit right in.

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But anyways, yes, they do have names.

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't remember what the names are.

351
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Rio Linda is from Sacramento is at Morris to Mobile, Alabama.

352
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh yeah, that's gonna help a lot.

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay, it's the boonies of California.

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Anyways, so yeah, that's my game week.

355
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was just Grand Theft Auto.

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I meant to download Killzone 2 because I don't have it pre-ordered at GameStop.

357
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, how will I ever get the demo that seems to be region-free?

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Maybe I'll create another free account in the UK!

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh no! I've bypassed her! Security!

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So yeah.

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Wow. Alright, my gaming week.

362
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't have a whole lot to share.

363
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
After last week's show, you might remember Rice Princess was going crazy over the fact that I had the Resident Evil 5 demo.

364
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So we actually went in and played the Resident Evil 5 demo and it was pretty cool.

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes, I'll give my impressions on that.

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was just like, heh, that's okay.

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Was that your impressions?

368
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, it was just like, eh.

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's kind of how I felt about it.

370
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It was alright.

371
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Resident Evil is not a series I've ever gotten into.

372
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I mean, I love zombies and stuff.

373
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There's another zombie series, of course, that I really got into that we'll be talking about later.

374
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have to get this off my chest, I'm sorry.

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I need to stop talking about this because I have to get this off my chest.

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I've been waiting all night to say this.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I played the absolute worst Xbox Live arcade game in my entire freaking life this week.

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Worse than Yaris?

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Worse than Yaris.

380
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And they're actually charging money for this one, okay?

381
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Apparently this is based off a game show or something, but I've never seen it before.

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And it is the worst fucking idea for a game I've ever seen in my life.

383
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's called Merv Griffin's Crosswords.

384
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh my god, this game was awful.

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Wasn't that actually a TV show?

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It is a TV show.

387
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I hope it got cancelled like five times because the setup of the show was stupid.

388
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The AI in the game was stupid.

389
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If they got an answer wrong, they would misspell words.

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I didn't even understand how the game worked.

391
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And the clues were terrible.

392
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Like, oh my god, this game was awful.

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I felt myself slowly dying being attacked by a pack of wild dogs or something while playing this game.

394
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It was so, so terrible.

395
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I can't believe they're even trying to charge $10 for it.

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh god, it was a horrible game.

397
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Really, Merv Griffin's Crosswords.

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I think I would have saw Merv Griffin's Crosswords and been like, nope, sorry.

399
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Why don't they bring us a good game like old school Press Your Luck?

400
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I know, for real, right? Bring us some good game shows.

401
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I know, right?

402
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Frisbee in Chat says, this game, S-U-C blank S.

403
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Exactly how I feel.

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I wouldn't even be upset if they brought back Bumper Stumpers.

405
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Bumper Stumpers was kind of like, how can you have Bumper Stumpers go on and on and on forever?

406
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It was great.

407
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Alright, forget it. Anyway.

408
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How do you man, did they bring a game of Double Dare?

409
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
VX JasonXV in Chat says, the game show itself is interesting.

410
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Games based off of game shows tend to suck though.

411
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Look, I would rather play the are you smarter than a fifth grader game all day long

412
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
than have to play five minutes of Merv Griffin's Crosswords ever again.

413
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
With Zombie Jeff Foxworthy?

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Actually, all things considered, the are you smarter than a fifth grader game wasn't bad.

415
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I mean, for what it is, you know what it is, it's an adaptation of the TV show.

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If you don't like the TV show, then whatever, you're probably not going to like the game.

417
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
For what it is, that live game is not bad.

418
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But this game was just not fun at all. At all.

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Maybe because you weren't a fan of the TV show?

420
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I never watched the TV show. I loved the Scrabble show back in the day.

421
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I like word game shows. The Scrabble show is awesome.

422
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Lingo. I love Lingo.

423
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
These are two games I would rather see on Xbox Live.

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You should have a game that you're an audience member at one of these shows

425
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and you can yell at the contestants and get them to do stuff.

426
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But it may or may not affect the answers.

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This whole one versus a hundred thing that's coming to Xbox Live or whatever that is.

428
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What are they calling that? The whole shows on live on live or whatever it is?

429
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's like they're not community games.

430
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hopefully it's like that.

431
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, I don't remember what it's called.

432
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hopefully it's not. It'd just be like Xbox Live.

433
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But in true Xbox Live form, when the host gets up there, you just have to start yelling,

434
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Fag, fag, fag, fuck, fuck, nah.

435
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Never mind. I'm not going to...

436
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You know what else they say on Xbox Live.

437
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's see. What else did I play this week as far as video games go?

438
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I just was so obsessed with hating that game.

439
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I did play the new R-Type game. That was kind of fun.

440
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I got to say, that whole switching between 2D and 3D with a button was totally pointless,

441
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
but it was kind of cool.

442
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's like, I'm turning the 3D on. Oh, I'm turning the 3D off.

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm turning the 3D on. I'm turning it off.

444
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And Deep Man in Chat says, did you mention Left 4 Dead?

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I did check out Left 4 Dead finally.

446
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
One of our listeners was very, very kind and gave...

447
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I guess they bought a four-pack together, but only used three of the codes.

448
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So they gave me a code. I was very, very thankful.

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And I did check out the game for a little bit, but not enough to give impressions yet.

450
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I haven't played enough at all.

451
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I got raped in like five minutes. That's how horrible I am at first-person shooters, okay?

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I was going down the stairs, and then some big fat guy comes down the stairs and rapes us all

453
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
because I don't know what I'm doing.

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So I need to figure out what the hell to do in this game.

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's just Left 4 Dead.

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I guess so.

457
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But it's like, oh, the dude just threw up on your party member. You're fucked now.

458
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I was like, I don't know what I'm doing. I haven't even played this for five minutes.

459
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Anyhow, yeah, that's going to do it for my gaming week.

460
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Matt, number two, did you play anything interesting this week you'd like to share with our listeners?

461
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm just a big square, and I play a little bit of WoW.

462
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm on that ever-long quest to hit 80 because I'm a noob.

463
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But you have like 20 characters.

464
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I do not have 20 characters. I have one of every class on Narzul, which is my main server.

465
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And it's funny because we do have TrekkieNerds on the show tonight, and I think every time.

466
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Most of my characters are named after what I have affectionately called obscure Star Trek characters.

467
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So, for example, Kes, Seska, Neelix, Gum2, Darmok.

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And if you're a Trekkie, you recognize hopefully a handful of those.

469
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I recognize two of them as Voyager names.

470
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's right.

471
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Darmok and Neelix was really obscure.

472
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He was on for like six seasons.

473
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But he cooked and he didn't.

474
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He was a main character. He was in the opening credits.

475
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He was on Voyager!

476
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He was a morale officer that became a security guy under Tuvok.

477
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So, obscure because you never really think of him. You think of Janeway.

478
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Trekkie's 3.

479
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, Trekkie's 3, exactly.

480
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What's that?

481
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I have to ask, do you like Warp 11?

482
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No.

483
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Sadness.

484
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
My main mage is Malak, but I had to rename him to Valerian since someone took the name when I had the transfer service.

486
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So, hopefully one day Valerian will be 80 and then I will have to work on my other, as Rob calls him, 20 characters.

487
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Bobcoffee and Chat says, I recognize all of those. I fail at life. LOL.

488
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
We both fail at life. LOL squared.

489
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
That was pretty much my gaming week.

490
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
My Xbox 360 has unfortunately remained dormant these past few weeks because WoW has taken over my life.

491
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Nice.

492
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Alright, speaking of Chat, I think they're previewing our new website in the chat room right now.

493
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I was talking about it on Bobby's show, but I don't think I mentioned it here yet.

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
We are going to be launching a new website soon and I think Deep Man was previewing it.

495
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And check it out in chat. It's pretty awesome.

496
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Dan, how was your gaming week? What kind of stuff have you been playing?

497
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It was awesome.

498
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I pulled down HD Remix, the Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix.

499
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And at first I played the demo and I was like, ah, super janky, no thanks.

500
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But as Street Fighter Mania gripped me, it was like, okay, I'll download it.

501
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And it's actually not too bad. It's a little bit easier than Super Turbo is normally, so that's pretty awesome.

502
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
See, Rob, these are the people that encourage this kind of behavior, re-releasing games.

503
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I know.

504
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, I'm terrible because I also downloaded R-Type Dimensions, which was, it kicked ass, you know.

505
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And I've got the remake of Bionic Commando. I'm a remake whore. Seriously, if it's a good remake, if it's a game that needs to be remade...

506
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Some of them are really good.

507
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Because of technology, I mean, I fully say remake it, but you've got to be real faithful and real respectful of the original material.

508
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
See, I don't have a problem with the Bionic Commando one because that changed enough of it.

509
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
They've added a whole bunch of stuff in it. It's not just like, okay, we made the sprites prettier.

510
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Frogger.

511
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Same game, you know.

512
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And Frogger, yeah, perfect example.

513
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
R-Type, I'm not really sure if they changed anything to it, but, you know, Street Fighter, I mean, they just made the sprites prettier.

514
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well, that was basically what they did with R-Type. I mean, it's R-Type 1, R-Type 2. It's got the 3D graphics.

515
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
They added a two-player simultaneous mode, which was actually kind of interesting, but...

516
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Cool.

517
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If you're an R-Type god and you could play through the whole game with no problem, yeah, it's still just R-Type.

518
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You are an R-Type god, though, from what I remember Jamie saying.

519
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah, I could totally dust, like, the first three levels of R-Type 1, then you get to level 4 when the game gets hard.

520
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And, I mean, I don't care who you are, R-Type gets real, real hard. I could beat it on the consoles, but this R-Type Dimension is a hard version of R-Type.

521
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't know if your hitbox in that game is bigger or what, but, you know, there's a lot of shooters and stuff that deserve remakes, and so I do encourage that, you know, as long as it's respectful to the original game and it's a game that needs it, you know.

522
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Tigerclaw in chat makes a good case. He says, Bionic Commando remake was awesome. You get the Hitler head explosion in full 3D.

523
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
True that.

524
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That is true. Very true.

525
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Alright, we're going to go ahead and get into some housekeeping tonight real quick, and then we'll finally get into some gaming news.

526
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Hold on, hold on.

527
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh, what?

528
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I have a few more things I want to add.

529
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
No.

530
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yes. Ah. What the hell, okay? I don't think we're talking about this tonight, so I'm going to mention it anyways.

531
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The Warriors on Xbox Live Arcade. They're making a new version of the Warriors game that's like, it's now like Final Fight, the Warriors.

532
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Speaking of didn't need to be remade.

533
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And probably won't have Guy in it.

534
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's just, it's, God, it's horrible. Why would they do that? The Warriors game on Xbox is so awesome. Just make that backwards compatible, and then we're done.

535
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I mean, I don't know. And I also wanted to say I saw Coraline in 3D and that was awesome.

536
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I want to see that.

537
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I haven't seen a 3D movie, at least with the new like real 3D or whatever stuff, and it was really sweet.

538
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Plus the polarized glasses. I think there's a way you can get your PC monitors to do 3D with the polarized stuff, so I'm going to play with that.

539
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Do you think that type of, you know, just totally random off the cusp question, do you think that type of technology might be coming to gaming someday?

540
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh yeah, definitely. I think actually it's already coming to gaming.

541
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
They're going to show that off at E3 this year with Avatar by Ubisoft. It's going to be in 3D as well.

542
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I wouldn't be surprised if it's polarized because that would make sense to me because it doesn't look that bad when you're not looking at it without the glasses.

543
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Because I was really surprised before. I'm just used to kind of like either the really weird blurry glasses or the red and blue stuff.

544
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So, you know, old school 3D stuff.

545
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But, I mean, the polarized glasses, it was weird because I put them on and I thought, oh, this is going to hurt my eyes and stuff.

546
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And I was like, wow, it's just looking like through normal glasses. But then, you know, the effect on the screen is really awesome.

547
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Well, a question for you. Do you ever, I think it's on the Wiimote hack website. There was the guy who did sort of the reverse by using the infrared sensors.

548
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, the, I forget what they call it. Yeah, I haven't done that. Just, I don't know. I can't get my Bluetooth stuff to work right.

549
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
If you can see the full 3D effect, even just watching a video of it, they should do something that would utilize that type of technology.

550
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Well, they were supposed to in boom blocks, if you remember, the developers want to do that.

551
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But they somehow, someone said no and they had to take it out.

552
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's going to be a little Easter egg in there where you could do it that way. I forget what they called it.

553
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But yeah, I think, I know like TrackMania, I think, does some sort of 3D thing. I don't know if it's with the red, blue glasses or if it's the polarized glasses, but that'd be fun.

554
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Because TrackMania is a sweet game. But that's it. Sorry.

555
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
No, that's all right. That's all right. Let's talk about really quickly housekeeping. I pretty much said all I wanted to say about the new website.

556
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Hopefully that will go live for everybody, not just during the show, but everybody will get to see that.

557
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Maybe in the next week or two. It's going to be awesome.

558
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Regular content, again, I'm so excited. We can actually do reviews and all that fun stuff. It'll be great.

559
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Otherwise, just make sure to keep following us on MySpace and Facebook, at the O.L. Army on Facebook, and LiveJournal as well at Orange Lounge.

560
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What, Loki?

561
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I was just thinking, because it is sort of housekeeping, the E3 news, you know, the special guests that we're going to have doing special...

562
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh yeah. I'm very excited about E3. That's all I have to say. Very excited about E3.

563
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes, this year at E3 because...

564
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I hope I can get in.

565
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I mean, I know I'll be able to get in. Getting my special guests in is going to be difficult, but we'll see.

566
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Anyways, possibly this year we will have Nellie coming in to do her Woman That Hates Gaming review of E3.

567
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Because we're going to go there for a couple days. We're actually going to a trip for Disneyland as well, because E3 happens to fall on her birthday.

568
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:13,000
So she said, you know, I'm going to be very loving and I'll go with you. You can go to E3.

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And as long as we go to Disneyland and stuff, I'm fine with that. I can go into E3 maybe a day or two or something like that.

570
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm very excited to get the Wife That Hates Gaming interview. It's going to be amazing.

571
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Alright, so we'll see. We'll see.

572
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news. We're like a half hour into the show and haven't gotten to gaming news yet. So, Loki, please take it away.

573
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Alright. Well, speaking of E3, the exhibitor list has been revealed and some people that had dropped out before are back, including Activision Blizzard.

574
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They are back after dropping out of the last E3. But, I mean, who can blame them? The last E3 was kind of ehhh. I don't know.

575
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But, it's interesting though. Even though Activision Blizzard may be there, the Blizzard portion of Activision will not be there.

576
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But, I mean, I guess they did have a few things they could have shown off like Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2. But, I don't know. I mean, I don't really know when all that's supposed to come out.

577
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So, they don't really necessarily need to show that, I guess.

578
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
What does Activision have that you want to see without Blizzard?

579
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Without Blizzard?

580
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Blizzard has everything. They've got Starcraft. They've got Diablo. They've got whatever's next for Warcraft.

581
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Activision's like, well, we've got Guitar Hero.

582
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Call of Duty.

583
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I mean, granted, they'll have...

584
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Well, Modern Warfare 2, sure, maybe.

585
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'll give you a list of what I want to see from them. DJ Hero. The new Tony Hawk game, which is supposed to be...

586
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I mean, granted, I want to see it. I don't want to buy it or play it.

587
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Killing a franchise.

588
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's the new Tony Hawk game where they're going to have an actual skateboard that you use for the game. So, that'll be interesting.

589
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
They're trying to sell us for $200.

590
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Exactly. Maybe you see what they're going to do to innovate with Guitar Hero.

591
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And then maybe Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and possibly the new Transformers game just to see if it's really sucky or not.

592
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, hey, I know the first game blew.

593
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Did you watch the trailer that's up on Kotaku for it?

594
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Yes, and it doesn't look any better than the first game.

595
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But it's a different developer.

596
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It doesn't matter. It's a movie game. It's going to suck.

597
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It'll be bad in a different way, and not all movie games suck.

598
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

599
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay, Wanted looks awesome, and that's going to be a movie game, of course.

600
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah, but it's not going to be awesome. You're watching the trailer and you're like, ooh, that looks like it might be good.

601
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Okay, yeah, Transformers, the new game trailer, there was nothing that said, hmm, I'm going to buy this. It just kind of...

602
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I mean, look at it.

603
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
If you even spend money to rent that game, you're high.

604
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It's for seven-year-old boys who love the movie and have to keep on living it.

605
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's not for gamers.

606
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But I want to keep on living the movie!

607
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Fine! Pirate it like the rest of us!

608
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay!

609
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But seriously, Activision has got nothing without Blizzard.

610
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
In fact, they may as well just call the whole company Blizzard.

611
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Well, they also have Alpha, was it Prototype, which looks really awesome.

612
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That's Sierra, but yeah.

613
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They've got Modern Warfare 2. That's it.

614
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I mean, and that should be Mankind.

615
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm excited about it.

616
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The hitball series is just waiting to make a comeback.

617
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No, it's not!

618
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
They try and stay dead.

619
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
They try that every generation.

620
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They keep bringing it back and it sucks.

621
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Didn't they already make one for the Wii?

622
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yes, and it sucks.

623
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Okay, it started off as a port of the GameCube game and they fucked that up.

624
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And so they made it into this new game where they renamed it and it still sucked.

625
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Okay, speaking of porting GameCube games, who's not bitter that Pikmin is just the GameCube version with Wii controls?

626
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's all they're doing, is putting out all these GameCube games with Wii controls.

627
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Oh, no, no!

628
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Well, don't get me wrong, I'm kind of down with that whenever I'm a remake whore, but come on!

629
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
No, they promised us a new Pikmin.

630
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
They are doing a new Pikmin.

631
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They're doing this, they're doing Pikmin and Pikmin 2, and then they're actually going to announce a new Pikmin at E3.

632
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Do a game I want to play again, like F-Zero.

633
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Oh, yeah.

634
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Well, F-Zero on the Wii would be awesome.

635
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Even if it's just GX, because that game was brutal.

636
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That better be the secret in Reggie's pants at E3.

637
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That's what they should be doing as one of the Wii.

638
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
New play control games.

639
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Zip, ew, Falcon Punch!

640
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No, seriously, they should do a new play control version of F-Zero GX, because that'd be perfect, but instead of this Mario Power Tennis, really, was that such a great game that it requires...

641
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No, Mario Power Tennis was pretty pimp.

642
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And come on, like Strikers, Strikers is awesome.

643
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Mario's aggressive death soccer is like the best game to ever happen.

644
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I still, still can't, you know, believe that that game is that good.

645
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I hate soccer, but I love that game.

646
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Sorry, I can't get that mental image now of Reggie Fils-Aime coming out at E3 and Falcon Punching us with his cock.

647
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I issue a challenge now to our listeners, especially the ones who were kind enough to do the kudaragi crayon eating picture.

648
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
No, no, don't make a picture.

649
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
We now want the Falcon Punch picture.

650
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
No, no.

651
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I will, I will send someone a shiny silver dollar.

652
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Keep it clean. Alright.

653
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That I ride on in Sharpie.

654
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Let's move on to something depressing to try and sedate the show a little bit here.

655
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Sadly, THQ has laid off about 100 people on their staff.

656
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And, you know, sad trombone, but, you know, it was the mobile gaming division.

657
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And I don't mean to sound, you know, crass. I feel sorry for those people. You know, it sucks to lose jobs and stuff, and the economy stinks and everything.

658
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
But, you know.

659
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Does THQ make anything besides SmackDown?

660
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, they make a bunch of SpongeBob, you know, and Nintendo licensed games, and Saints Row 2, which I love.

661
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh yeah, they did make Saints Row 2. That game was not so bad.

662
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Anyhow, well, here's the thing. They are actually going to be restructuring the wireless subsidiary.

663
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Apparently, though, they actually closed completely the San Diego Mobile Studio, as well, and some offices in the UK and Germany.

664
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
They are still going to be cranking out some wireless games, though, out of Finland.

665
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
They are Uni Versomo Studios, and I guess this means, I don't know, more Worms Mobile, things of that sort.

666
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
They did a mobile version of Saints Row. I don't think it was any good, though.

667
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I don't know. If they did, like, Worms World Party for, like, the iPhone, I'd be down.

668
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah, I mean, again, I feel bad. I don't mean to joke about people losing their jobs, but at the same time, you know, mobile games...

669
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No, it's cool. If you've got a job, just go for it.

670
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
There might be good news for mobile things later on in the show we're going to get into.

671
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The only good news for mobile gaming is the iPhone, which is awesome.

672
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Well, that's exactly what we're going to get into a little later in the show.

673
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, well, then I won't spoil it.

674
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But for now, we'll get into some more gaming news, won't we, Dar Sakura?

675
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes, we will. Who likes Netflix?

676
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Me! I have watched seasons one and two of 30 Rock on Netflix on demand on the Xbox 360. It's great.

677
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:32,000
See, speaking of Netflix on the Xbox 360, they did a survey that went out to a few members that was asking them if they would pay a little bit extra for premium content, like, from cable channels, like HBO.

678
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And it's sort of, I guess, rumored that it's going to be around, you know, ten bucks extra.

679
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Don't encourage them.

680
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But, um, I don't know. I think some people would be excited by it.

681
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Nobody will be excited by it.

682
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
There are consumer whores.

683
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Look, I like the idea of offering some more of this premium content. Like, being able to watch the tutors on demand and all this kind of stuff sounds kind of awesome.

684
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because I like that type of period piece fucking. Because that's what the tutors is. I don't know if you've ever watched it, but it's period piece fucking, basically.

685
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But here's the thing is that, then if they set the bar and they say, oh, we're going to charge this premium content for all this extra stuff on Xbox 360, then everybody's going to want to be premium content.

686
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm going to have nothing left to watch but independent documentaries about strippers that went to stripping because of Hurricane Katrina, which, yes, is an actual documentary I once watched on Netflix 360.

687
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
That's all that's going to be left is Hurricane.

688
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Awesome.

689
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Premium content, good. Paying more, bad. It's already $9 a month for the super basic level with the unlimited streaming, which is great through the Xbox. I love it.

690
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's awesome. It's got me watching more TV than ever, which is really what society needed.

691
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But at the same time, it's like, oh, man, don't give them any reason to charge us more.

692
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It's giving us Doctor Who. We've got up to season four now, right?

693
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
No.

694
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
No?

695
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We have season four, but we're not paying extra for it. It just came with the Netflix.

696
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Well, I'd be curious if you signed up for premium membership.

697
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It takes away subscribership from HBO, Cinemax, all that stuff from cable subscribers because now they can just download for a whole lot cheaper.

698
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:19,000
The main shows like Big Love, Tutors, other Sopranos from back in the day, those types of shows I'm at, I would be curious to take away subscribership.

699
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
That's a good question, but I wonder if they would care because they're still getting money from you watching their shows.

700
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So maybe they don't care. They still get their money one way or another.

701
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's true, or the cable companies are maybe losing revenue.

702
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, to hell with them.

703
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I'm sure that Netflix is actually paying a certain percentage to the premium channels for content.

704
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I mean, that would make sense, or else HBO would be like, bitch, please.

705
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Well, they pay a licensing fee for the movies that they use, but I mean, it's not like they're going to show The Sopranos every night after it comes on like they do CSI.

706
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Xlink in chatroom says, gives a very honest response. This is why I torrent. It's a very honest response.

707
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's whether the legality is questionable or whatever.

708
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Same here.

709
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Well, Dan says, why pay for what I conceal? But also, there's something to be said, just like iTunes.

710
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Why do people actually use iTunes when you can go out and find the downloaded MP3?

711
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Because sometimes it's a pain in the ass to find the actual MP3.

712
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Because I have an iPhone.

713
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, how convenient is it that you can just sit there, tap a button, and you will have the full song for just a buck?

714
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And it's legal.

715
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And you get the warm fuzzies, legal, supporting the artist, all that stuff.

716
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I get the warm fuzzies doing the opposite.

717
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Well, you're evil.

718
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That's because you're a pre-vert.

719
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
All right.

720
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay, that's not true.

721
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

722
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Netflix isn't really gaming, but at the same time, that's what people use their 360s for lately. At least I do.

723
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
One million. One million subscribers.

724
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I spend more time on my 360. Seriously, if you look what I've done the past week, on the 360, I played that horrible Crosswords game.

725
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I played...

726
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Sweet.

727
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Netflix.

728
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
My PlayStation 3 is actually where I've been gaming lately, because I have Prince of Persia on PS3.

729
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I've been playing that on Little Big Planet. I've been playing the hell out of.

730
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
That's been my PS3.

731
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I'm actually using my...

732
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Which is weird, because I always thought PS3 was supposed to be the system that was going to be my all-in-one entertainment center.

733
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But, like, I'm the complete opposite lately.

734
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't know what the hell's up with that.

735
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I don't know.

736
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I use my PS3 for streaming stuff. It works pretty well.

737
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
All right. Who cares? Anyway, it's all right. Let's move on with gaming news.

738
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Gauntlet DS is potentially cancelled.

739
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This is coming from various retail sites that have been telling their customers it had a pre-order that's been cancelled.

740
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That it's been removed off of GameStop and some other retail websites.

741
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I know from a distributor standpoint, I think it was locked and basically put out of print.

742
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Which either means that it's got a to-be-announced release date, or actually it's cancelled.

743
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So, it's pretty much cancelled.

744
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Could it possibly be in limo?

745
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Like, might the game be changing hands or something?

746
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It could be. It happens a lot. In fact...

747
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
With Midway going through all the problems it's been having too, you know.

748
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Thank you for reminding me too.

749
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That was something I got to touch on at a special time later on.

750
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
There was something going through limbo.

751
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Okay.

752
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Anyways, it's very possible something like this. It looked okay.

753
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't remember being that impressed by it, because I did play it at PAX, but it was all right.

754
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Anything four player on the DS would be really cool.

755
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Four player with voiceover IP during the game.

756
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Anything that you're waiting for from Midway, don't hold your breath.

757
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It pains me to say it, because I love Midway.

758
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Me too.

759
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I love Mortal Kombat and a lot of their IPs, but that company is boned.

760
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It is too bad.

761
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
They owe twice what their company is worth.

762
00:42:49,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The only solace that you'll get is the fact that probably the big studios that they own in the franchises will be snapped up by bigger, probably more stable companies.

763
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:09,000
They'll all belong to EA or Act of Blizzard before it's all over, but Midway is going down the tubes.

764
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You've got to wonder how much Midway lost on that stranglehold or whatever that game was.

765
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
They brought in that big, huge name director and they spent all this money marketing it.

766
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I think the game made a ploop when it landed.

767
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's not just stranglehold. They've just had flop after flop after flop.

768
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
They have all these great franchises and they would try to bring them back.

769
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
They did Spy Hunter for the PS2 back in the day, and Spy Hunter was great.

770
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
So they're like, ah man, we'll do Defender.

771
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Defender wasn't a bad game, but nobody cared.

772
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And their treasures collections are awesome.

773
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The Midway treasure collections they did on Xbox, like the 20 old games, like Rampage.

774
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Yeah, they sell hand over fist.

775
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
You've got to wonder how they could be in that much trouble.

776
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I guess the development budgets on their not-whoring-out-at-all franchises have just been out of control.

777
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was kind of their last hurrah, I think.

778
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I've got to read this comment from Chad, because this is a good point.

779
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I apologize if I'm mispronouncing his name.

780
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
In chat.orangetonshooter.com, Spike Guru says VOIP over 802.11b. Wouldn't that blow?

781
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Because the DS isn't the most powerful wireless networking device.

782
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

783
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
They said they had it working, or maybe they couldn't get it working, and that's why.

784
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
If they could make it work, you know.

785
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't really see how much you're going to really need voice for Gauntlet.

786
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I mean, it's nice, but it's Gauntlet.

787
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
True, true.

788
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
All right, well, maybe here's-

789
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Hit that thing with an axe! Quick!

790
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Grab the treasure!

791
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
No, my treasure!

792
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Quit dying!

793
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Elf shot the food.

794
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Gauntlet, people!

795
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Well, I don't know.

796
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's not that complex!

797
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Whoops, shot the food.

798
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Dan, maybe this is a game you would be more into for the DS.

799
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Lego Battles is a game that's going to be coming out on the Nintendo DS.

800
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's coming from Warner Brothers and TT Games.

801
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Robler's Tales.

802
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
TT. Telltale.

803
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
TT.

804
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Titties!

805
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It's a Lego-based strategy game, basically.

806
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I think Loki's kind of talked about this a little bit on the show before.

807
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Really?

808
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Did I?

809
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Officially, now, out there, that you're going to be, like, having bases that you're building and defending.

810
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It's Lego castles, Lego's pirates, Lego's space-themed.

811
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You're going to have units that you can actually-

812
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You can actually have pirates and space people in the same team.

813
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So, like, you can mix and match all this stuff.

814
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You can tell there's Lego ninjas that just don't matter.

815
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Well, actually, apparently, in the press release, you can have pirate swordsmen fighting wizards and aliens, dragons battling ninjas-

816
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And that's going to be the greatest Lego game to ever happen.

817
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Pirate ships launching broadsides against spacecraft and knights.

818
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And you can also play this game local multiplayer.

819
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Sadly, no V.O.I.P.

820
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm sorry, pirate ship fighting a spaceship, that's just ridiculous.

821
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I mean, seriously, what, it's a pirate ship, got cannons and shit, the spaceship's like,

822
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm just going to fly higher, bitch.

823
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh, you're dead.

824
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
They need to make a game like this, but, like, not Lego's.

825
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You need to go old school and get, like, the Blacktron Lego's in there.

826
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
No, no offense against the Lego's, but I want to see, like, dragons versus spaceships for real.

827
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm a fucking Duplo in this shit.

828
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Duplo would totally dominate because they'd just be giant, indestructible blocks.

829
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It's my pirate ship.

830
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It'd be, like, tech level low, but resistance is, like, super high.

831
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And cost, well, cost of anything Lego is just through the roof.

832
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Boy, it's like construction fighter.

833
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It could be Lego versus Mega Bloks.

834
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Lego's and Duplo's and Tinker Toys and Lincoln Logs.

835
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Have you seen the Mega Block Halo toys that they're doing?

836
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
You can get, like, Warthogs and Scorpion tanks and stuff all made of Mega Bloks.

837
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
There's a franchise that someone should have jumped on.

838
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I know it was an April Fool's joke, but Lego Halo would have been sweet.

839
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
The chat room is talking about, like, a Lego fighting game, and the Rob D says you could lose parts as you fight.

840
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That would be fun.

841
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah.

842
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Just knock the blocks off of somebody. That'd be fun.

843
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Lego Street Fighter.

844
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Did you see, um, speaking of Legos also, did you see the pictures someone did of the Starcraft 2?

845
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah.

846
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That person is my hero. That was the most awesome thing I've ever seen.

847
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Very cool.

848
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Alright, so Lego Battle's coming to the DS, I believe the release date's summertime, so we'll see.

849
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
April.

850
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
April, that's in time for my birthday.

851
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Nice.

852
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Ninjas and Dragons on Jamie's birthday. Who could ask for more?

853
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Rock.

854
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Well, for our UK friends, I'm so sorry.

855
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's just that this game is coming out as making me laugh.

856
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
They're bringing out a Coronation Street game on the DS, which is sort of like, as far as I know,

857
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
it's sort of like a weird soap opera-y type show out there, kind of like, what is it, the other one, EastEnders?

858
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I think?

859
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You look...

860
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
That wasn't on the mic.

861
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Dan didn't say it in the mics, you guys didn't hear it, but he went way to cover the gaming news that matters.

862
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
We have listeners in the UK.

863
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I also want to point out when Loki reads release dates, he reads things like Imagine Teacher and Imagine Baby's Dance Party.

864
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Hey, I want to cover everything, okay?

865
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So we have to cover everything.

866
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So we can make fun of it.

867
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
There would be a hundred more people interested in what she's talking about than Imagine, you know, sitting around and fucking yourself.

868
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Because you know what, if we're going to read release dates that matter to me, we wouldn't be reading anything.

869
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Can I get my story, please?

870
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yes, you may.

871
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
This is the official STFU for me, thank you.

872
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Anyway, yeah, Coronation Street is really, really popular, it has 78% of the UK's television audience.

873
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So basically it's like, if you're going to watch TV and it's on, that's the only thing to watch, I guess.

874
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:24,000
But they're doing a DS game by, I don't really know too much about what's going into the game exactly as far as the play of it will be.

875
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But it's supposed to be out for Christmas this year, so...

876
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yay, you get Coronation Street!

877
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Did you do a little Briton DS game?

878
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
That PlayStation 2 one was awful.

879
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yeah, they did a PSP and PS2 game.

880
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
What?

881
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Do not want.

882
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I think that Top Gear and Doctor Who are the only things that justify the continued existence of the BBC.

883
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.

884
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures. Whatever that is.

885
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh, and Primeval. Is Primeval still on?

886
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
What's that?

887
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Primeval, that's a good show.

888
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No, I haven't seen Primeval, but it might download to Merlin.

889
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And the new series for afterlife on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, that's pretty decent.

890
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
It is, yes.

891
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So there's actually lots of good stuff on BBC, but it really is about Doctor Who.

892
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
The staple of British television, in my opinion.

893
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And Top Gear.

894
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Going from something on the BBC to something that's very American.

895
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Godfather 2, EA has delayed the release of the game because apparently releasing Godfather 2 on the same day as Killzone 2, not a good idea.

896
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So they decided to hold it off a little bit. I believe now it's coming out the second quarter.

897
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Beginning of April, probably.

898
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So, cool. I don't know. I'm not too excited about Godfather. I didn't play the first one.

899
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I mean, it's my type of game because it is like a Grand Theft Auto sandbox type of thing.

900
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You owe it to yourself to pick it up and try it.

901
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It actually is a pretty sick game as long as you don't get too much respect.

902
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Because then you stop being able to shake the crap out of people and make them bend your will.

903
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Because you can just walk into a store and just grab the dude and beat him up until he gives you what you want and you'd be like, that's awesome.

904
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Sweet.

905
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
See, I'm wondering if Godfather 2, because I haven't read much about it, if it takes place further in the past, like when Vito Corleone was a kid.

906
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Or if it's going to be just like, oh, there's more Godfather.

907
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I think it's a continuation.

908
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
That's not as cool.

909
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And they basically have now online multiplayer as well.

910
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Yeah, that's probably mostly the whole attraction.

911
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Multiplayer would be fun, though. Then you can slap your friends.

912
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I want a Scarface, too.

913
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Scarface, you know, and it was kind of like, oh, he didn't die.

914
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
He didn't die and he did it all again because he was so happy the first time.

915
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Told him a tenner and I'm an idiot. Jesus.

916
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
All right. As long as this time when they do the portable versions, they don't make them into strategy games.

917
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Because seriously, everyone comes to my store and wants to buy the portable Scarface game.

918
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And I'm like, fine, buy it. Then they bring it back like ten minutes later.

919
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
What is this crap? It's a strategy game.

920
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Well, you should have read the back of the book.

921
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I wanted to run around and shoot people. I'm talking right now.

922
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
This is why people need to read the reviews and look at the back of the box. Dumbasses.

923
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
All we have is a disc. Can you look at the back of the disc?

924
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm saying in general, Dan, and people, you can look online and find reviews.

925
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I think it's a safe assumption that if the box looks the same and it's on the PS2 and the PSP, it should be largely the same game.

926
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But it's not. So you're right. Kind of.

927
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Oh, and I was going to say, too, I mean, we shouldn't, you know, be harking too much on the UK for having a TV drama being turned into a game.

928
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Because after all, Ubisoft is bringing out Grey's Anatomy for the DS and the Wii.

929
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It could have played like Trauma Center.

930
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It is supposed to play like Trauma Center, but with more drama.

931
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Aren't they downsizing that team?

932
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Sadly, there's an audience.

933
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Good developers are getting fired.

934
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Sadly, there's an audience for that, too. You know, there are people, plenty of people that will probably buy that game.

935
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I sold one copy of Hell's Kitchen on the Wii. One.

936
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,000
OK? There's not an audience for that. I mean, unless they're buying it somewhere besides game stores.

937
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It's terrible. Why are they making all this crap?

938
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I like cooking and yelling.

939
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Honestly, the Nintendo Wii, and you heard it here, if you're listening, one of the dozens and dozens of listeners on Orange is on the Radio.

940
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
If you're listening, I'm saying it now, the Nintendo Wii is going to cause gaming Armageddon.

941
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's the return of the Atari 2600. It's shovelware.

942
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
They're putting anything they can on it to try to make a quick buck. Come on, they're making Grey's Anatomy.

943
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
No. That's terrible.

944
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It will probably be better than E.T.

945
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
The Nintendo DS is probably that, too.

946
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It will probably still be better than E.T.

947
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I don't know. Really, if you played E.T. when that game came out on Atari, it had, like, music, and the character was animated.

948
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
And when you were young and didn't understand, it didn't suck that bad.

949
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
All the people who bang on E.T. now never even played it.

950
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I did play it. I fell in the hole 50 gazillion times.

951
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Your wife wants to say something bad.

952
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It's because you suck at video games. Seriously.

953
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
E.T. was not that bad a game.

954
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Yes, Atari was arrogant.

955
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Yes, they made more copies than there were 2600s, which is terrible.

956
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Give, give, give.

957
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Dan.

958
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
We get it.

959
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
No, no, no.

960
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I have the story.

961
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Did you even beat E.T.?

962
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
No, I never did. No one ever has.

963
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
In the existence of mankind.

964
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
There's a YouTube video of someone beating E.T.

965
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
YouTube videos can be fixed, sir.

966
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Whatever.

967
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yes, when you beat E.T., the real E.T. comes out, and it's actually a good game.

968
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The real E.T. comes out, shakes your hand, and goes to space.

969
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
No, I was going to say, E.T.'s a notorious bomb, but that's because Atari produced more copies than there were a dying system.

970
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Well, I mean, they also have, what is it, Prison Break coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.

971
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Why that game now?

972
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And some other examples of really quality stuff on the Wii.

973
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
We have a game coming out that's supposed to tie into a Garfield movie that came out two years ago.

974
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Now coming out on the Wii because it's been delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, and delayed some more.

975
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
We have ghosts.

976
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Oh my god.

977
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I seriously think we're about ready to have Armageddon live here in studio.

978
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
There's a storm going on outside.

979
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Weemageddon!

980
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
That last burst of wind almost blew over the garage door. That's going to be scary.

981
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
This is what we hear outside.

982
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Whenever you get the little awning piece from the roof, it's like...

983
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It'll be live on Justin.TV, too, when we all get blown away.

984
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I will get blown away.

985
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
You're controlling the apocalypse.

986
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
You're all fucked.

987
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Can I read a Turok story?

988
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Rob, do your story, please.

989
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm going to read a Turok story.

990
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
ET is officially banned on Orange Lounge Radio.

991
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No way. Veto'd.

992
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I have to say a word that I just heard.

993
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Weemageddon.

994
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
You should copyright the word.

995
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Copyright? Dude, bad. You should copyright that.

996
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It's my word! I said Weemageddon.

997
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
The mats are fighting over Weemageddon.

998
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Weemageddon getting out of here.

999
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You can have Weemageddon.

1000
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Go back on the tape, please.

1001
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Look, moving on. Turok.

1002
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Turokageddon.

1003
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Turok, of course, was reinvented recently on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and all that.

1004
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I didn't play it. Did you play it?

1005
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
There's a franchise that needs a comeback.

1006
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Oh, wait. No, it didn't.

1007
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Apparently some folks agree with you.

1008
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Turok 2, rumor is it's been canned.

1009
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Before it was even announced.

1010
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Apparently this is because of some layoffs that just happened to Disney.

1011
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Again, this is all kind of rumored.

1012
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Had nothing to do with the poor sales of the first game.

1013
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
But they say maybe Turok 2 will return to development someday,

1014
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
but a bunch of the core people that were doing it are no longer there.

1015
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
But here's the sad thing. Apparently propaganda games that was making this game

1016
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
were also the people that were supposed to be doing the Tron game for the new Tron title.

1017
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So they all might have been sacked.

1018
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Better find people to do the Tron game, or I will personally go there with steel-toed boots

1019
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
and kick every last one of them in the nuts.

1020
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Here, you want to make some money? I'll tell you how you do it.

1021
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
It's very simple, okay?

1022
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
You take the Left 4 Dead concept,

1023
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Jurassic Park, your surviving dinosaur attacks, and that's it.

1024
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
They did that. It sucked.

1025
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Actually, that would be pretty awesome.

1026
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game.

1027
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,000
They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game, and it blew.

1028
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
It was scary. No, that was the one on Super Nintendo.

1029
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
That scared the shit out of me.

1030
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It was the Sega CD one, but the arcade one blew too.

1031
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
No, I'm talking Left 4 Dead with dinosaurs.

1032
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That would be cool. I'm down for that.

1033
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
This is the game that they need to make.

1034
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
This is the game that they need to make using the Left 4 Dead engine.

1035
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
They need to do Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness.

1036
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
They did comics.

1037
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
How about Goats vs. Dogs?

1038
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
How about I do my story?

1039
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
How about I read a chat comment real quick?

1040
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
There's actually some insightful stuff from chat.

1041
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
TheRobD actually says something a little bit insightful,

1042
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
so I have to go to chat for insightful comments tonight

1043
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
because no one in the studio is saying anything.

1044
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
TheRobD says,

1045
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Is it funny that we take it for granted that a game will have a sequel, isn't it?

1046
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So we're kind of all new to Rock 2 is going to be coming at some point.

1047
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Don't we all kind of take it for granted that sometimes we're going to be getting sequels?

1048
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Well, because some of these games, regardless of the quality of them,

1049
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
they keep putting out sequels.

1050
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
For example, Transformers.

1051
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Well, it's because I think if the first one makes any remote amount of money,

1052
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
because people aren't willing to do anything original

1053
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
because they want to stick to those franchises that they think are going to sell.

1054
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I mean, thank God we have, you know, Freaky Guy bringing us Noby Noby Boy

1055
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
or else we'd have nothing original.

1056
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And yet they still won't bring us Guardian Legend 2.

1057
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I know!

1058
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I'm sorry, Noby Noby Boy isn't that original looking.

1059
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It looks just like Katamari.

1060
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Well, you know the video games industry is doomed

1061
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
because they made another Turok after Turok Evolution.

1062
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And Turok Evolution, for anyone who played that game, was bad.

1063
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Really, really bad. Not a good game.

1064
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Was it as bad as Superman 64?

1065
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Yeah.

1066
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
And then they went and made Superman Returns, which was not very good either.

1067
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
That wasn't a sequel to Superman. I mean, there's a difference between a sequel.

1068
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It was a reboot.

1069
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah, that's kind of like what Turok, this last Turok was.

1070
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And actually, it was the last Turok reboot was Evolution and it was horrible.

1071
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And Superman Returns, which was not a bad game if you only paid ten bucks for it.

1072
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Sixty bucks? No, ten bucks? Yeah.

1073
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
You know, you could be Superman and you could blow cars around and tear up Metropolis

1074
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and that actually hurt you.

1075
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Okay, here's a better example then.

1076
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I did not play Superman 64 expecting Superman 2600

1077
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
where you would fly and then be chased by the kryptonite.

1078
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Superman for the 2600 was sweet.

1079
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Superman 64 managed to be worse than that.

1080
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Because the expectations were higher.

1081
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Because the 64 should have had a good game where you flew around and did interesting things.

1082
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Loki, go ahead. We got to keep the news moving because we're like an hour into the show.

1083
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I think it's my story actually.

1084
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Well, Hugh had a quick thought and then we'll move on.

1085
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah, so I was going to say Activision, Neil, the purveyor of fine games,

1086
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:02,000
decided that Pimp My Ride the game was so awesome that they're going to put out Pimp My Ride street racing.

1087
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yes, Pimp My Ride the game. Awful, awful, awful.

1088
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I hate to say it, I have to talk people out of buying Pimp My Ride almost every day.

1089
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Alright, let's move on to some release dates, try to keep things moving forward here.

1090
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We're going to start off in the UK, Dark Sakura, what's coming to the UK?

1091
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
For our UK listeners, on the 10th is Tomb Raider Underworld Beneath the Ashes on Xbox 360.

1092
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
On the 12th is Flower for Playstation 3 which I really don't know anything about.

1093
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's like flow but with flowers.

1094
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
That sounds kind of cool.

1095
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Also on the 13th we have Bomberman 2 on DS, yay Bomberman.

1096
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Deadly Creatures on Wii, Eternal Sonata on Playstation 3,

1097
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Fear 2 Project Origin on PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3,

1098
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Kings Bounty the Legend on PC, Last King of Africa on DS,

1099
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Mushroom Men sounds hallucinogenic, that's for PC,

1100
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Shell Shock 2, Trails on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360,

1101
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Star Ocean the Second Evolution on PSP,

1102
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
and The House of the Dead Overkill on Wii because you can't kill enough zombies.

1103
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Alright, very cool.

1104
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
In the US there is actually quite a bit coming out as well.

1105
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Fear 2 Project Origin on both PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

1106
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
X-Blades coming out on PC, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360.

1107
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Deadly Creatures coming out on the Wii.

1108
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Let's see, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

1109
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
You love remakes, this shit looks hot.

1110
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
This game they're doing there, they're gonna be upgrading them all to 720.

1111
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Sadly they won't be widescreen.

1112
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
But supposedly some classic arcade games are locked away too.

1113
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Congo Bongo is in there right here.

1114
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
We did it all that last Genesis Collection.

1115
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
It's like you play so many games and you unlock the arcade version of Altered Beast.

1116
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This Genesis Collection looks really awesome.

1117
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
It's like 40 games, some really good stuff.

1118
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
40 games for 30 bucks.

1119
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Well, and they're Genesis games.

1120
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Genesis is the superior 16-bit system, so obviously you don't see a lot of Super Nintendo collections.

1121
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I have to say, I'm sometimes not a big fan of these remakes and stuff,

1122
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
but this looks pretty hot.

1123
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
This isn't even really a remake, it's just a collection.

1124
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It's a repackaging.

1125
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Well sure, but I mean a remake is, you know, they make it three years.

1126
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Loco Roco 2 on PSP.

1127
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Then on the Wii and the Xbox 360 we have Oni Chambara Bikini Zombie Slayer.

1128
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Yes!

1129
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And on Xbox 360 Oni Chambara Bikini Samurai Squad.

1130
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Have you seen the cover art for that game?

1131
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:54,000
This game is so epic that they made a movie for it in Japan.

1132
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
A theatrical movie.

1133
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm going to be so broke this week.

1134
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I'll bring you some cover art. It's fantastic.

1135
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Let's see here.

1136
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Then we've also got some other crap that no one cares about.

1137
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Jake Power Fireman for the little kids.

1138
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,000
NASCAR Kart Racing because, you know, the Wii doesn't need a true NASCAR game.

1139
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That would be insulting to its audience.

1140
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
My do-it-all for the DS, which is like a PDA device.

1141
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Retro Game Challenge, which is a collection of a bunch of fake 8-bit games.

1142
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
That's kind of neat.

1143
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
House of the Dead Overkill, which will be truly epic.

1144
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Mass Effect is getting re-released as a two-disc edition.

1145
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
They're going to have the download content in it as well.

1146
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And it's going to be $19.99, so that's pretty sweet.

1147
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And let's see here.

1148
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And that's actually it.

1149
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
What's kind of interesting, though, is also this week...

1150
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Is this Street Fighter IV this week?

1151
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
No.

1152
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
No, that's next week.

1153
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Aw, dammit!

1154
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Ha ha!

1155
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Blame.

1156
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Anyways, also, actually technically still this week,

1157
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon, I believe, will be coming out next...

1158
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
16th?

1159
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Actually, well, no, never mind, that's supposed to be Tuesday, so that's next week.

1160
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That game's going to be great.

1161
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And then I think Lost in the Damned this week,

1162
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
or Lost in the Damned for Grand Theft Auto IV.

1163
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So that is what I'm really looking forward to.

1164
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Man, I thought Street Fighter IV was this week.

1165
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
No, it's next week.

1166
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
What are you still thinking, Rob?

1167
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Blame.

1168
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Well, guess what?

1169
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
They get in Japan this week.

1170
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Street Fighter IV on February 12th, coming to Japan.

1171
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Well, hopefully it's region-free.

1172
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And has English options, because I can't read Japanese, sadly.

1173
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It's Street Fighter.

1174
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Yeah.

1175
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Well, I know, I know.

1176
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
But then I don't get those awesome endings.

1177
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'm just hoping that the US one has the option to turn off the dub soundtrack.

1178
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I think I heard it does.

1179
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Good.

1180
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
PlayStation 3, you also get Street Fighter IV in Japan,

1181
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
but you also get Skate 2 gets a release in Japan on the 12th of February,

1182
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
because games come out on Fridays over there, I believe.

1183
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Mobile Suit Gundam.

1184
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Another one of those games from Bandai Namco.

1185
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
This one's called Giren no Yabu Access no Kyui 5.

1186
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So yet another Gundam game.

1187
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
On the DS, it doesn't look like there's actually a lot of stuff coming out.

1188
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
There's a game called Hitamari Sketch, Doko Demo Sugoruku X365.

1189
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And I have no idea.

1190
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I'm trying to look at screen caps for this game.

1191
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Just saying it is fun.

1192
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yeah, I know, just saying it is fun.

1193
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It looks like it's another minigame collection on the DS,

1194
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
made up of little WarioWare-ish minigames,

1195
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
kind of what it looks like to me.

1196
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I guess that could be cute.

1197
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
But they're all cute little Japanese schoolgirls on there.

1198
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And on the Sony PSP this week, not a whole lot,

1199
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
but you do have Tenchu 4 looks to be a pretty big release

1200
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
coming out over there this week,

1201
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
as well as a port of the Gundam game that's on PS2 this week.

1202
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Otherwise, a pretty quiet week in Japan,

1203
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
probably because of Street Fighter IV pretty much dominating.

1204
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So there you go.

1205
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
There's your release dates for Japan.

1206
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So let's get back and do some more gaming news.

1207
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Well, we have our Virtual Fighter.

1208
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Virtual Console UK news coming out,

1209
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
actually should already be out as of Friday,

1210
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
is Clay Fighter, which is on there for 800 Wii points,

1211
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the equivalent of six pounds or eight euros.

1212
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And the other game that's on there is Sonic Chaos,

1213
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,000
which was a Master System game and is 500 Wii points.

1214
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So it was actually the first Sonic game that had Tails playable.

1215
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
There you go.

1216
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Is Clay Fighter on the US Virtual Console?

1217
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
If you can pull that down, that game is great.

1218
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I stopped following Virtual Console a while ago.

1219
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I don't know if we ever got Secret of Mana.

1220
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Secret of Mana is supposed to be on the UK one, I thought.

1221
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Jeez, I don't think we got that here yet.

1222
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Seriously though, Clay Fighter, you can be a Clay Elvis fighting a Clay-like Norse Valkyrie chick.

1223
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Helga.

1224
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Fighting a blob.

1225
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Clay Fighter.

1226
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Clay Fighter.

1227
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Come on, fight them if you dare.

1228
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Clay Fighter, great.

1229
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
There was a viral video making this round this week

1230
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
that supposedly was a leaked Dead Rising 2 trailer.

1231
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
And we know all about leaked trailers

1232
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:41,000
that they sometimes tend to be not leaked by someone stealing it,

1233
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
but they're leaked on purpose.

1234
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
This was shot off of a screen, apparently, off a TV.

1235
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And it showed what looks to be a teaser trailer.

1236
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Basically, it looks almost like an overrun Las Vegas-type area with casinos.

1237
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:09,000
One seemed to show someone in a giant American Gladiators hamster ball thing rolling over zombies.

1238
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
So, to be honest, I think it's actually authentic.

1239
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
And I think it is purposely released by Capcom

1240
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
because the audio in it, if you notice, is actually a direct feed from the trailers.

1241
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
So, it's not just shot off a TV audio.

1242
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Any idea if we're going to get some multiplayer co-op in this?

1243
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Because that's what Dead Rising needed.

1244
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
It was a great game, but man, if it had, sort of like Left 4 Dead,

1245
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
multiple players in the Dead Rising kind of gameplay against millions of zombies.

1246
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Oh, dude.

1247
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah, no idea what it is exactly, but I know at the very end of the trailer

1248
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
it actually flashes the number 2 really quick.

1249
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And there's also another scene that you see Frank Wesson in the Mega Man outfit again.

1250
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I've been in a war.

1251
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Can I say, though, that Capcom has a really good pulse on where we want to kill zombies?

1252
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Because when I saw this trailer and saw that the next one is in Vegas or whatever,

1253
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I was like, that's awesome.

1254
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
No doubt.

1255
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Just like when I saw the first one, it was killing zombies in a mall. That's awesome.

1256
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
There's one company that knows killing zombies, that knows slaying the undead. It's Capcom.

1257
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Let me put it this way. If this is fake, it's an amazing fake.

1258
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Yeah.

1259
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And maybe Capcom should do this if this is a fake.

1260
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
For real.

1261
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
But I will be willing to bet that you'll see this at E3.

1262
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Easy.

1263
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Start the buzz now.

1264
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
What better way to get people talking about it than put out a trailer that's supposedly stolen, you know?

1265
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Make a demo for E3 of E3 infested with zombies.

1266
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
That actually would be pretty badass.

1267
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And you killing people are zombies.

1268
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Or maybe in the reverse, you're a zombie and you're killing people.

1269
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Well, the buzz is also starting on this game. It's Saw.

1270
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The game.

1271
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
You know, this is weird because I heard before that Saw was supposed to be coming out.

1272
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
It was in development and then got cancelled.

1273
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Well, apparently now Konami has picked up the rights to do Saw.

1274
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I guess Brash Entertainment had started this game and stopped it.

1275
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
And now Konami has actually picked up the rights since that other company closed down.

1276
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Variety was the one to actually report this.

1277
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
The game is now going to be developed by Zombie Studios.

1278
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And it's supposed to come out right when the sixth Saw movie comes out this Halloween.

1279
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And I'm like, they really are on Saw 6?

1280
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It doesn't seem like something you can adapt into a game at all.

1281
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I mean, it just doesn't work for me.

1282
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I don't see how you're going to be able to do it.

1283
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
You know what?

1284
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
To the dismay of fans of it in the room, I can foresee this.

1285
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
If Konami makes Saw and it's a hit, it will kill Silent Hill.

1286
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Oh, I know. That's the sad thing.

1287
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And, you know, because I'm thinking in my head, I'm like, well, okay.

1288
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
But wait a minute. Konami's done Silent Hill.

1289
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Granted, these are two completely different developers.

1290
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I've never really heard of this Zombie Studios before.

1291
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
They have nothing to do with Silent Hill.

1292
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
But I'm like, well, okay.

1293
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Silent Hill is actually a pretty rad game.

1294
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So, like, if they made Saw, like, kind of like a game like that.

1295
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
But I'm like, I just don't see Saw being a game like that.

1296
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I don't think it's going to work.

1297
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I think it's just going to be gross killing.

1298
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And it's sad. I don't think Homecoming did well.

1299
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
They're doing everything they can to stem the tie.

1300
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
They tried to action up Homecoming.

1301
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
They tried to do the remake, the Origins one.

1302
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
And, you know, that's all Konami needs.

1303
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
If they come up with another horror franchise,

1304
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
they'll probably put Silent Hill out to pasture.

1305
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Yeah, I don't know how well Homecoming did.

1306
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But I'm worried that there may not be a sixth one.

1307
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So, I hope you're wrong.

1308
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
But sadly, you might be right.

1309
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So, don't buy the Saw game.

1310
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Lee M'Geddon.

1311
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
But honestly, though, I mean,

1312
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I don't see how they're going to be able to do it.

1313
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's just, it's not...

1314
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Saw isn't a franchise that's really action-packed or anything.

1315
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And, I mean, it's...

1316
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Neither is Silent Hill.

1317
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Well, Silent Hill is easy...

1318
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
They'll just do the same thing, except for you'll be dodging, like,

1319
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
traps made by the Saw guy.

1320
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
And, you know, every once in a while you get yourself into some sort of weird ethical dilemma

1321
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
where you have to kill somebody.

1322
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
And honestly, it sounds like they might be able to make a pretty cool game out of it.

1323
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I'd buy it.

1324
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
We'll see. We'll check it out at E3.

1325
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Just to kill Silent Hill.

1326
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Jamie, you express a lot of dish pleasure at the news of a Saw game.

1327
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Are you excited about it?

1328
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I will stab you in the face.

1329
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Oh, it might be...

1330
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
If you buy the Saw game.

1331
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Saw in real life.

1332
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
No, because, first of all,

1333
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
the concept of Saw is, well, retarded.

1334
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Sorry!

1335
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
And not very interesting.

1336
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And how can you...

1337
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
I guess, you know, if Nightmare on Elm Street did...

1338
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
You know, this is, I guess, our Nightmare on Elm Street for the modern age, except,

1339
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
you know, Freddy Krueger was funny.

1340
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
But...

1341
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And the fact that they're now rebooting Friday the 13th, right?

1342
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
There's that new movie coming out.

1343
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
But Jared Padalecki's in it.

1344
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
And, uh...

1345
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And it does look cool.

1346
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
The, uh, Nightmare on Elm Street, they're also doing without Robert Englund.

1347
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Which will not work.

1348
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You can't...

1349
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
But Robert Englund in there, he's not doing anything.

1350
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I mean, seriously, who's here?

1351
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
He's slowly dying. That's why they can't put him in it.

1352
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It doesn't matter!

1353
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
He's old!

1354
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
He's dying of old!

1355
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Anyway...

1356
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
My point is, is that, you know,

1357
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Saw is a gimmick.

1358
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Silent Hill, you know, basically,

1359
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
a lot of thought went into the psychology of the game.

1360
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And it created its own sort of mythology around what made that universe work.

1361
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You know what I mean?

1362
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah, in other words, Pyramid Head is not a gimmick.

1363
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
He's a fucking rock star.

1364
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
They should stop putting him in every single game.

1365
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
But my point is that...

1366
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I mean, sure, if you want mindless bullshit in a game,

1367
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
get Saw. Go for it.

1368
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Buy mindless bullshit.

1369
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
If you want a game that's gonna make you, you know, think a little bit

1370
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
and actually use your brain...

1371
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And possibly pee your pants.

1372
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And possibly pee your pants, yes.

1373
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Go for Silent Hill.

1374
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Besides that Silent Hill 2, Chainsaw.

1375
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Perfect.

1376
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Silent Hill of Superior.

1377
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.

1378
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
We're like an hour fifteen into this show.

1379
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
We're not even close to the end of a...

1380
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
This is why Dan comes once every five years.

1381
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Dan's funny.

1382
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
If you didn't want to hear from me, you wouldn't have invited me.

1383
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
We like Dan. We like Dan. He's funny.

1384
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I invited my sweetie here and cuddled with him and said,

1385
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Come be on the show.

1386
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
He goes, okay, and then lost his phone.

1387
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Anyway.

1388
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
So the...

1389
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
We gotta go to Jamie for our next story.

1390
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize she hadn't done the other story yet.

1391
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Anyway, anyway, anyway.

1392
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Guess what we were speaking earlier about series getting a reboot.

1393
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So guess what's next in line?

1394
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Splatterhouse.

1395
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Which totally makes sense with Friday the 13th getting its reboot

1396
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
because then you've got Dude in a Hockey Mask.

1397
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And freaking Splatterhouse is awesome.

1398
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I love the picture on the little article because I was the guy with the chainsaw hands.

1399
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Anyway.

1400
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And as we all know, the game is actually out on Virtual Console right now.

1401
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
But they're talking later this year.

1402
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Namco Bondi is planning Quarter 3 for doing a new Splatterhouse game.

1403
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And there actually is an official site up.

1404
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
If you go to splatterhousegame.com,

1405
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:24,000
you can see some of the images from the game.

1406
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And you can actually now...

1407
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
This is the first game that lets you use your own severed limbs as a weapon.

1408
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Yeah, your arms and stuff and your skin will get ripped off as you're playing the game

1409
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
or as you're getting damage done to you.

1410
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
And your limbs will grow back and you can actually beat people with your limbs.

1411
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
This won't be rated M or anything.

1412
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
There's a lot of controversy about this because apparently Namco just whacked the dev team for this game.

1413
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Which was a California-based developer.

1414
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I don't know if they handed it to another team or if the game is going to be back or in limbo.

1415
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I heard the Afro Samurai people might be able to take it.

1416
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Or the arm of the developer got cut off and given to the other team to use in developing the game.

1417
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
This news, though, is coming right out of New York Comic-Con which was going on this weekend.

1418
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Right, so it's interesting that we hear the dev team get sacked,

1419
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
yet they're showing it at New York Comic-Con going on this weekend.

1420
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Which is crazy, so it's interesting.

1421
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh, that's the corporate world.

1422
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Fast-paced, ever-changing world of video game development.

1423
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Exactly, but that's okay because in Splatterhouse they'll grow the limbs back.

1424
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's alright.

1425
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Anyhow, a couple more stories and we'll get to the classic game of the week in a break.

1426
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Alright, well there is a brand new update that they did to fix the HDMI audio issues that they were having with the HDMI audio cable for the 360.

1427
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
However, as with most updates, it seems, there are some problems.

1428
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,000
And apparently a lot of people are reporting that after this update was downloaded to their Xbox 360 system,

1429
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:07,000
that they received the brand new present of an E74 error message, which is one of the one red light problem.

1430
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
And it's funny because that also happens to be not covered by their warranty.

1431
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
D'oh! And sad trombone.

1432
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And so, yeah, a lot of people are pissed off at that.

1433
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,000
You mean Microsoft developed a game console with a problem.

1434
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
No! No!

1435
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I've taken back six Xboxes in the last week.

1436
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Was it all because of this update?

1437
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
No, those things just break.

1438
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
They don't have to update them to break.

1439
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Microsoft don't even worry about updating them. They're just going to break!

1440
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
You look at them funny and they'll break.

1441
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Seriously?

1442
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
It's like the Xbox has feelings.

1443
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
You look at me funny and I'm going to shut down.

1444
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You used me to do all your gaming and bought stuff for me!

1445
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I just want to cuddle!

1446
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Oh, but you know, I love when they ask you on the phone, was it plugged into a search protector?

1447
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Oh yes, it was the search protector's fault that my console broke.

1448
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Alright, look, we got a segment we don't do on the show very often,

1449
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
but when we do it, it's just because there's such stupidity that goes on out there in the world

1450
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
that sometimes video games get a bad name.

1451
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,000
That's why we have to give out a stupid award.

1452
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
This week's stupid award goes to Daniel Alvarez.

1453
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
He lives in Austin, Texas.

1454
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Why does he get the stupid award?

1455
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Because he got arrested on charges of assault.

1456
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Because what he did, he assaulted his girlfriend with a Wii controller.

1457
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Also, and possibly the even more hideous crime as reported,

1458
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
he's also suspected of eating her cookies.

1459
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
He seriously jumped up behind her with the nunchuck strap and like super spider with it.

1460
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yes.

1461
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Like it's like a Rottwein.

1462
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Wait, I'm not done. I'm not done.

1463
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Look, like this is one of those things.

1464
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Look, we got this report off of Kotaku, and this is like one of those things that's so stupid,

1465
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm not wondering if they just made the damn thing up.

1466
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Like, seriously?

1467
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I'm looking at this. No, listen to this.

1468
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Apparently, Christina Alvarado, who is the girlfriend,

1469
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
what happened is that she actually told the police that she was attacked by her boyfriend,

1470
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:43,000
and the thing was, she was pissed off at him because he ate her Girl Scout cookies.

1471
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And he was pissed off because he got woke up to get yelled at about the Girl Scout cookies.

1472
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
So I guess to teach her a lesson, he choked her with a Wii controller.

1473
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Don't you dare. Ever.

1474
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Because I wake him up all the time for eating my stuff out of the fridge.

1475
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I was going to kill you. It would not be with a Wii controller.

1476
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Well, the unofficial city motto of Austin is keep Austin weird.

1477
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
That's frickin' weird right there.

1478
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So I might go ahead and lean on that one to be true.

1479
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And FYI, it does not appear to be made up.

1480
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
They've linked to a source here that apparently says, yes,

1481
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
an Austin man has been accused of trying to choke his girlfriend with a cord of a Wii video game controller

1482
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
after she became angry that he had eaten all of her Girl Scout cookies.

1483
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
You know what the gag is, though?

1484
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
For the people who don't know about the way that the nunchuck works

1485
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:41,000
is that all Wii controllers are cordless.

1486
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I bet that damage that any cords would not be covered under the warranty.

1487
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I wonder if that's what the defense attorney will try to say.

1488
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:52,000
All she would have to do is yank hard and unplug it.

1489
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
If you have the other hand on the remote, the other hand on the nunchuck.

1490
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I want to know what type of cookies they were

1491
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
because if they were Samoas, I kind of understand.

1492
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
They're not Samoas anymore, Rob.

1493
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
No, they are always Samoas. I don't give a shit what they're calling them on the box.

1494
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
I agree. And Thin Mints.

1495
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Caramel sucks a lot.

1496
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I need to know one thing.

1497
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Yes.

1498
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Was he wearing the wrist strap?

1499
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
No, no. Even better, even better, did it have the condom on?

1500
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
See, the mats think alike here.

1501
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I was going to say the exact same thing before Loki took the mic away.

1502
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So, yes, we need to know if it had the Wii condom on and the safety strap.

1503
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Because if it didn't have the safety strap on, Nintendo would have...

1504
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
They're not dealing with that.

1505
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Isn't it even funnier if somehow during this whole struggle of him strangling her

1506
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
that somehow the remote flew into the TV?

1507
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
You guys are sick, sick people.

1508
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And it pains me to be associated.

1509
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
They fought over fucking cookies.

1510
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
They kind of...

1511
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Did you think that was serious?

1512
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
At least there were no tacos thrown.

1513
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
People have been trying to kill each other with game controllers for years.

1514
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I don't know if you know this.

1515
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
It dates back to the 2600 days.

1516
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Back when we had the NES advantage, I could see someone getting killed with an NES advantage.

1517
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
He's got a scar on his back in the shape of a ColecoVision controller.

1518
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Then there was this one time that I woke up and Jamie was just stuffing a power pad down onto my face.

1519
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
She's been trying to kill me with a game controller.

1520
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Now she knows. Use a Wii remote. I'm dead.

1521
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
You fuckers have killed me.

1522
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room has a great idea for a new video game.

1523
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Cookie Guy versus Taco Kid.

1524
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Dark Knight asks, does Miyamoto have to choke a bitch?

1525
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Oh boy.

1526
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
We need to get to the classic game of the week and take a break and try to find our souls.

1527
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
So every week here on Orange Lawn's radio,

1528
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
DarkSakura likes to dig through the archive of great gaming

1529
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
and find a video game she believes all of you should be playing.

1530
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's our classic video game of the week.

1531
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
DarkSakura, which should the kids be playing this week?

1532
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
GORF.

1533
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Bless you.

1534
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Well, I didn't throw up yet.

1535
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
GORF.

1536
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
GORF stands for Galactic Orbiting Robot Force.

1537
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It's a very bizarre little game because it's like a version of three games in one.

1538
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Basically, your first level, you've got different missions.

1539
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
So going through different missions will set up your rank.

1540
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Anyway, I guess what you're hearing, it's just about shooting.

1541
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
It's basically Space Invaders. The first stage of GORF is Space Invaders.

1542
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:41,000
The first level is Space Invaders with a big circular shield that you kind of have to shoot through.

1543
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Yeah, the second level is, well, like my husband was saying, behind the scenes,

1544
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
is like Galaga where you have to shoot the little planes that shoot down.

1545
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
It had the crappiest collision detection ever.

1546
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
It wouldn't even shoot you and you'd explode.

1547
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Stupid game.

1548
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:14,000
And then the last level was another, well, at least in the arcade version,

1549
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,000
you had the Galaxian-type level and you had a space warp-type level after that,

1550
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:29,000
which was the gyrus-like level where it's sort of a weird perspective as if you're going into the warp.

1551
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
All kind of tempest-y, but not quite, as far as the perspective.

1552
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And then the last one is the flagship one where actually you're going and shooting the alien ship

1553
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and it has a shield around it, like a semi-circular shield, so you have to shoot through it.

1554
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
And the game was actually supposed to be a tie-in with Star Trek The Motion Picture,

1555
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
but it didn't fit in with the script, so they said no.

1556
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So they put all these great 80s space games in a blender and out comes GORF.

1557
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Pretty much. On top of that, it was actually saying here that it used the Votrax speech synthesis chip in the arcade version,

1558
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
so it had the robot voice in it too. It was pretty cool.

1559
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I only played this in the arcade a couple times. I had this on the Colecovision,

1560
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
which to me is just the best version of GORF ever.

1561
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I love the little music place.

1562
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:30,000
But it's also saying that the GORF hardware actually was compatible,

1563
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and you could switch it out for other games like Wizard of War.

1564
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I'm going to do something here with the music.

1565
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I'm going to switch to the Commodore 64 version just because I love Commodore 64

1566
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
and I see that there's one here on this.

1567
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
But GORF was out on like a million different systems, it seems. Right?

1568
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Yeah, it was out on quite a few.

1569
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I think I played this on Commodore 64. This looks familiar to me.

1570
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I remember the circular shield and all that stuff. Good times.

1571
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:05,000
But basically though, as you go through the levels and get to the end of it,

1572
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
and I've gotten to the end of it on the Colecovision,

1573
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:19,000
you get space cadet, space captain, space colonel, space general, space warrior, and space avenger.

1574
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:24,000
There was a sequel planned called Ms. GORF. Yeah, I know.

1575
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Does Ms. GORF have a bow in her hair? Is that what differentiates her from GORF?

1576
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I don't know.

1577
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It was actually, I think it was programmed in fourth language.

1578
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Is that like fourth meal at Taco Bell?

1579
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Well, the programmer of GORF owns the source code

1580
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
and it apparently only exists in a set of eight inch floppy disks.

1581
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
There were versions on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Colecovision,

1582
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
the Atari 8-bit BBC Micro, Commodore 64, VIC-20, and 1982.

1583
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,000
The Galaxian mission was removed from all home ports.

1584
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:13,000
It was given an Atari Jaguar port just by some guy.

1585
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
You know, did it as a hobby.

1586
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And it was taken off of the market because he didn't go for any of the copyrights.

1587
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So, bastard.

1588
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I'm bored. I think I want to remake GORF.

1589
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I know, right?

1590
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Also, the current world record for GORF, recognized by Twin Galaxies.

1591
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And the...

1592
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Hey, I watch King of Kong.

1593
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I actually realized a giant fart was enough to make the high scoreboard on GORF.

1594
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Here, let me make the scoreboard right now.

1595
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
As Rob puts the microphone towards his crotch.

1596
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Anyway, he also made the Guinness Book of World Records

1597
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:01,000
by a guy named Todd Rogers on November 24th, 1982 at Haunted Trails in Burbank, Illinois.

1598
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
He is?

1599
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Oh, apparently he's in the King of Kong.

1600
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
And my husband says he looks like Ron Jeremy.

1601
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Kind of.

1602
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
With the Rob D's in chat going, I hate Todd Rogers.

1603
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I know it's Todd Rogers. I hate him.

1604
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
But the high score was 653,990.

1605
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I want someone to break it.

1606
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
That would involve playing GORF.

1607
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
GORF is fun.

1608
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I am putting out a personal challenge to someone to break Todd Rogers' score on GORF.

1609
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
653,990.

1610
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
GORF backwards is frog.

1611
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
It would actually be pretty awesome if you could break it with a score of 666,000.

1612
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:54,000
If someone, whoever manages to break that will get a no prize from me,

1613
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
will be interviewed on Orange Town's radio,

1614
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
and will win a shiny penny.

1615
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
You also get it in the Guinness Book of World Records, though.

1616
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
You might.

1617
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Alright, look.

1618
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Enough GORF.

1619
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Frog.

1620
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
No, good choice.

1621
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It's definitely a game I think a lot of people have not heard of or forgot about.

1622
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
So bringing GORF back to the spotlight, and hopefully that old record can be shattered.

1623
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
How about a little anecdote regarding me picking that game?

1624
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Sure.

1625
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I was actually trying to think of a good epic RPG, and I was like, ah, fuck it, GORF.

1626
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Whatever works for you.

1627
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Whatever works.

1628
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
It just stuck in my head.

1629
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Alright.

1630
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Anyhow, we're going to take a break while Dan and Jamie get into an argument.

1631
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
We're going to take a break.

1632
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Everything she knows about classic video games she stole from me.

1633
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
And then she flipped me off.

1634
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Right on the air.

1635
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
We're going to take a break, you guys.

1636
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
We'll be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.

1637
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
We have more to come in Part B tonight.

1638
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
We're going to talk about Indiana Jones and a great Indiana Jones game that might be making

1639
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
a comeback.

1640
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
We're going to finally talk about iPhone gaming, which I promised Dan we could do earlier.

1641
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And a new project from Rockstar Games, which I'm sure has Loki pretty excited.

1642
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
We'll be talking about all of that in Part B right after this.

1643
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Stay tuned, guys, with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1644
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Welcome, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the

1645
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,000
8th of 2009, where we are doing the 312th episode of our show, Orange Lounge Radio.

1646
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
We always tape live Sunday nights at AllGames.com.

1647
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Of course, if you were listening live tonight, there was a little bit of mad stuff going

1648
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
on during the break.

1649
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
We've kind of been joking throughout the evening.

1650
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
There's a lot of wind and rain type stuff going on outside.

1651
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It seemed to have knocked our network out for a little bit because we dropped during

1652
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
the break.

1653
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Our podcast listeners won't notice a thing because they just get that little break in

1654
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
between there.

1655
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
But we're going to get right back on with the show, so I apologize for running a little

1656
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
late.

1657
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
We're going to try and catch up some time here.

1658
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
And I know we have folks that want to call in to talk about New York Comic-Con and all

1659
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
that stuff.

1660
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
So we're going to try and move a little bit quickly through news in Part B. We'll see.

1661
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I had the small announcement, though.

1662
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Oh, yes, you did have a small announcement, Dark Soccer.

1663
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I just got this inspiration during the last segment on Part A. I kind of want to do a

1664
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
monthly top score contest on a classic game.

1665
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
And I know not everyone has different things, so I'll pick different consoles and arcade

1666
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
or whatnot.

1667
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:15,000
But I will be putting something up very soon for a high score classic game contest.

1668
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
And talk to our web guy about that.

1669
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Because with the new website and everything, there's now a thing where you can upload pictures

1670
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
directly to our website by sending it this particular email address so people can send

1671
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
their scores.

1672
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Maybe we can do a little widget or something with the scores.

1673
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
We could probably put something together pretty easy.

1674
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It would be fun.

1675
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I'm still working on it.

1676
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:38,000
But, you know, I used to do the game knowledge quiz back when I had Pump Up the Volume.

1677
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And I'd kind of like to do something like that again.

1678
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
That'd be fun.

1679
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Yeah.

1680
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
All right.

1681
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Well, anyhow, let's get into some news now.

1682
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
And we'll start off with Loki.

1683
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
He's bringing us some news on an old classic series, right?

1684
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Yes, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings was the new Indiana Jones game that they announced

1685
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
for the Wii and DS.

1686
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And, you know, it actually looks pretty cool.

1687
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I'm glad to see that LucasArts is working on an Indiana Jones game.

1688
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But something that's also pretty cool is they're going to be bringing a special unlockable

1689
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
for the Wii version.

1690
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It will have the adventure game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

1691
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Sorry.

1692
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
You didn't hear that music on the feed.

1693
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
My bad.

1694
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
So, yeah, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis on the Wii version.

1695
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Pretty good if you don't have, you know, a SCUMM emulator on there.

1696
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Or SCUMM VM.

1697
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And this is like one of the all-time classic, you know, click and point games.

1698
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
So it's pretty awesome.

1699
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Are they not doing that 360 and PS3 one that they announced?

1700
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Maybe not right now.

1701
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
It might be later on.

1702
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Weak.

1703
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Well, this is also on the Wii.

1704
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So maybe just, you know, multi-platform?

1705
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Everything but, yeah, Wii, PlayStation 2, and PSP.

1706
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Because, you know, they can port that crap easy.

1707
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
So, I don't know.

1708
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
There may be another one coming out for the PS3 and 360.

1709
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
They're still working on it, so.

1710
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Well, I don't know if you would file this under Wiimageddon or what you'd do,

1711
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
but apparently EA, they made a lot of announcements this week

1712
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
because they had a financial call going on this week.

1713
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
And apparently they are going to be porting Dead Space to the Wii.

1714
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
This says, a quote from the call, the CEO John Riccitello says,

1715
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
We're bringing core intellectual properties and franchises

1716
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
in categories we think have legs on the Wii platform.

1717
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
A good example of this is Dead Space.

1718
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Unfortunately, what you don't know is that it's going to be Dead Space Party.

1719
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And it's actually going to be, you know, Party Spinoff

1720
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
because, you know, they couldn't really do an actual legit hardcore game for the Wii.

1721
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Well, I don't know.

1722
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But the interesting thing about this is that they actually say,

1723
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
and also this from a magazine interview, quote,

1724
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Go look at Dead Space and imagine playing that game with a wand and nunchuck.

1725
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
If they improved the precision, then you could have a good experience.

1726
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Hmm, is it a hint that MotionPlus could be supported by this?

1727
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
And imagine that the graphics look slightly worse.

1728
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Slightly.

1729
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It's like this.

1730
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,000
If EA pulls this off, and they're a company on the upswing,

1731
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
I mean, I know that profits are down and they're laying people off,

1732
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
but creatively, wow, that's a great word,

1733
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
you've got to give EA credit.

1734
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
They're head and shoulders above where they were last year this time, you know.

1735
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
They're coming off of Dead Space, which was amazing.

1736
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Mirror's Edge, which was a heck of a game.

1737
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Just a bunch of great titles coming out of EA.

1738
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
If they pull this off, props.

1739
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
I mean, because the Wii needs super cool games,

1740
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
but man, I don't know how you're going to do it without the graphic power

1741
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
because Dead Space is a game where the visuals are just so important.

1742
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Well, okay, granted, if Dead Space really is about the graphics,

1743
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
then, you know, whatever, but should games really be about the graphics?

1744
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Not necessarily, right?

1745
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Well, maybe, maybe not, but I mean, play Dead Space.

1746
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I mean, have you played Dead Space?

1747
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
No, because it's first person.

1748
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
That game will fuck you up for life.

1749
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I'll check it out, but I just know not yet.

1750
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
It's atrocious, and I think so much of the atmosphere in that game

1751
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
is it's just super, super good visuals.

1752
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
But I will say, one of the other games you mentioned,

1753
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I'm not usually much of a first person gamer,

1754
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
but Mirror's Edge is pretty hot.

1755
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I think that game is pretty hot.

1756
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Yeah, and it's one of those things where it's like if they tried to do that on Wii,

1757
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
and they could do it right and have motion controls and stuff,

1758
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
hey, you know, great, more power to you.

1759
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
The Wii needs these games, you know, even if it's not about graphics,

1760
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
which it's not about graphics, if they could bring this game

1761
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
in a meaningful way to the other system, to the Wii,

1762
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
it would validate the Wii's existence

1763
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
because there are too many minigame collections.

1764
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
And don't get me wrong, I know for the Wii's mainstream target audience,

1765
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
that's, I guess, what sells.

1766
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,000
But, you know, they need it.

1767
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Again, if you're just joining us live tonight here on All Games Radio,

1768
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games,

1769
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I just want to point out that's Dan, Jamie's husband,

1770
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
often talked about on the show but rarely heard from.

1771
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
But he's here tonight and telling it like it is from his experience

1772
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
in working in game stores for many years.

1773
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Well, in other gaming news, especially in iPhone gaming news,

1774
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
which, you know, as a person who has an iPhone

1775
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
and actually plays the games on it,

1776
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I still don't know what I think about having this one on there

1777
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
because it just seems like it would be cheaply easy.

1778
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:31,000
But Time Crisis is supposed to be coming on to the Apple App Store,

1779
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
actually already on there, where you can play with the finger of death.

1780
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Instead of shooting the guys on the screen, you tap them,

1781
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
so I guess it's like punching them in the face with a gun.

1782
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And the way that you dodge is by tilting the iPhone to do your dodge move,

1783
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
which I suppose is also reload.

1784
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
So you can now poke people to death.

1785
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Very interesting, though, at this rise of, you know,

1786
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
console gaming franchise classics coming on to iPhone.

1787
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And I don't know if it's just because it's kind of like all Namco and Konami,

1788
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
but, you know, just within the past, like just within 2009,

1789
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
we've had news of Katamari, Time Crisis, Silent Hill, Metal Gear,

1790
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
DDR, all having, yeah, there's a Silent Hill iPhone game now.

1791
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Oh, you weren't here last week.

1792
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I have it, if you want to check it out before you buy it and spend $7 on it.

1793
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
But there's, yeah, Silent Hill iPhone game now.

1794
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Don't do it.

1795
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
It's not fog, it's not fog adventure Silent Hill.

1796
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It's like a dungeon explorer type thing, so just, you know, try before you buy.

1797
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
That's what I'm saying.

1798
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
But, yeah, there's a Silent Hill game on iPhone now.

1799
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It's crazy.

1800
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So it's just interesting, this whole, you know, barrage of stuff we're getting.

1801
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I don't think the Metal Gear Solid game's out yet, but we know it's coming.

1802
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It is in the works, at least.

1803
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Oh, geez.

1804
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Metal Gear.

1805
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
It's just interesting, I suppose.

1806
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Well, you know, I was going to say another game we didn't talk about

1807
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
because it wasn't our show role, but Rolando.

1808
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I don't know if you remember that game.

1809
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Oh, yeah.

1810
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That's a great game.

1811
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
They're doing a sequel to that, actually, on there.

1812
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
And they have, I think, they're doing a free version, you know,

1813
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
like a trial version or something like that.

1814
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
So that's going to be available now, but, I mean, that's a pretty cool game.

1815
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I completely forgot to mention this during my gaming week

1816
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
because I sometimes forget that my iPhone has become a way for me to do gaming,

1817
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,000
but Aurora Faint 2, the arena, I checked out and downloaded a solid,

1818
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
solid fucking game.

1819
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Who made Rolando?

1820
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
That I don't know.

1821
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
No idea.

1822
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Aurora Faint is a hell of a puzzle game that I'm enjoying on an iPhone.

1823
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
It's LocoRoco.

1824
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Yeah.

1825
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
It's great.

1826
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
It is LocoRoco.

1827
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
That's crazy.

1828
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
But one thing that you won't find anymore on the iPhone app store

1829
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
is the iPhone Duck Hunt game.

1830
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yes, the Nintendo lawyers have finally swooped in like a duck

1831
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
and plucked the game off the...

1832
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Anything about the game in Watch?

1833
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
And then the dog rose out of the bushes and laughed at him.

1834
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
You know the Nintendo lawyer, after he laid the smack down on that stupid little company,

1835
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
did the Nintendo duck laugh.

1836
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
What about the Game & Watch games, though, that were on there?

1837
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I don't know.

1838
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Those may still be on there.

1839
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I downloaded a couple of them.

1840
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yeah, I downloaded the one that was free, but I didn't download any of the others.

1841
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Reggie's going to show up at your house and personally lead them off your iPhone.

1842
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
He's going to Falcon Punch us with his cock.

1843
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Show me your move.

1844
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
I did want to give a quick shout-out real quickly,

1845
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
because we were talking about iPhone games and Namco and all their franchises.

1846
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Not on the iPhone, but on the PlayStation 3.

1847
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I believe a Namco collection is being released or has just recently been released,

1848
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and I hear it's pretty cool, and you want to check it out.

1849
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
The Namco Museum on PS3.

1850
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I think it's only in the Japanese store.

1851
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Remember, because they were tying those in also,

1852
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
you can get like t-shirts and shit for home.

1853
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I think it's going to be on its way here pretty soon.

1854
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I hear you want to check it out.

1855
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I didn't come out for the 360 like last Christmas.

1856
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Well, they had the Namco. It was a Namco arcade something for the 360.

1857
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
They had like a bunch of the Xbox Live Arcade games,

1858
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
and then they had some other classic games and remade stuff,

1859
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
and that was supposed to be pretty good, and I think it's probably pretty cheap now.

1860
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Yeah, it had some live. It was like 30 bucks, and it had like 30 games or so.

1861
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I mean, it was this really weird thing because it had games you could play off the disk,

1862
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
then it had games you had to import on your hard drive and play as like live arcade games.

1863
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
You know, and it had like a lot of stuff you might have already downloaded.

1864
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
It had like Pac-Man Tournament Edition and stuff like that, or Championship Edition.

1865
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Yeah, it looked like a great collection. Really cool stuff.

1866
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I was really surprised they did it because I figured they'd just keep, you know,

1867
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
shelling them out to us 10 bucks at a time over the network.

1868
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
All right, well, we're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute.

1869
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com with your emails,

1870
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
but I have one more story about iPhone gaming,

1871
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
and this ties in kind of exactly what you were saying a little bit ago,

1872
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
and this is iPhone is growing and growing and starting to become mobile gaming.

1873
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:01,000
In fact, right now, they are saying that iPhones are accounting for 14% of mobile game downloaders,

1874
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
and that was in the month of November. 32.4%.

1875
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
That's like a third of all iPhone users say that they have downloaded a game.

1876
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
In the month of November, they downloaded some type of game.

1877
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Just to put that in perspective, across most mobile phone companies, you're looking at 3.8%.

1878
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So, you're talking like 10 times as many people on the iPhone check out games.

1879
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Is that because the iPhone gives you?

1880
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Go back a year on this show.

1881
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Just go back one year on this show before iPhone apps started coming out.

1882
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Mobile phone gaming was kind of the butt of many jokes on this show.

1883
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But in other countries, mobile gaming has been just fantastic,

1884
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:46,000
but we haven't had a phone until the iPhone or the Trio or the ones like that came out

1885
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,000
that was capable of handling an actual game with solid gameplay.

1886
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
And let me say this to the chatters.

1887
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
chat.orangelandradio.com, we always look at that here on Sunday Nights.

1888
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Catacos in the chat room says, well, let's get serious.

1889
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
What other phone can play games on them that are that good?

1890
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Might I mention the N-Gage?

1891
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
No, good. That are good.

1892
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
The iPhone, you know, it amounts to like 3%, 30%, whatever, of games downloaded,

1893
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,000
but it amounts to 100% of the decent phone games to download.

1894
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
I will say this, that I did have a couple of cool games on my old phone.

1895
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It was intensely hard to play, but I did have Super Pac-Man.

1896
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Once in a while, there were even, as hard of a time as we gave them in the past,

1897
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,000
there were, like, the Luminous one that they had on phones was pretty frickin' good for a phone game.

1898
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,000
And the Doom RPG and stuff, they had some pretty intricate stuff even on the old-ass phones.

1899
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I did play Bejeweled on my old phone.

1900
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
So, you know, but most of it was a joke because it was cashing in on the SpongeBob, you know, and all that crap.

1901
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
You know, they were just crappy little games.

1902
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Spikaru says, I have an N-Gage and does NES and Mega Drive emulation pretty well.

1903
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
That's the only thing it's good for.

1904
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I guess that would be a reason to have it.

1905
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Tony Hawk on N-Gage was not that bad.

1906
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,000
All right. Let's get to the mailbag here, guys.

1907
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have questions for us.

1908
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Every week you guys send in your e-mails and we like to open up the mailbag and read through them.

1909
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
And Dark Soccer's going to do it right now.

1910
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Do we actually get some e-mails this week?

1911
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Yes, we did.

1912
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
All right.

1913
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
We had a poor showing last week, so I'm glad people listened.

1914
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Rob with Two Bees says there's new box art on Neo GAF.

1915
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
What's Neo GAF? G-A-F?

1916
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Neo games are fun.

1917
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yeah, these huge forums that, you know, tons and tons of people look at.

1918
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Okay, I just haven't been there before.

1919
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Probably because there's like a million different gaming forums on the internet.

1920
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Supposedly the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame is being ported to PS3, Xbox 360.

1921
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Yes, it is.

1922
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
He says I actually bought this for PSP, Wii, and PS2.

1923
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I'm curious to see the graphics.

1924
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I'm curious to see if they add some more tables.

1925
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
The Wii, you know what?

1926
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Oh, God! Fun House is on the freaking cover. I hate that game.

1927
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Call Wii Mageddon as much as you want, but that Wii game was pretty awesome.

1928
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
The pinballs. Dan's giving his thumbs up of approval.

1929
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Yeah, that was a pretty awesome collection of games, I gotta say.

1930
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
If you like pinball, you have a 360, download Pinball FX.

1931
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
It's awesome.

1932
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
But Pinball Hall of Fame is great.

1933
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
If they go crazy, add some new tables for the 360 PS3 versions, that'll be awesome.

1934
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
It's actually a really good pinball collection, really good physics.

1935
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,000
And honestly enough, my vote's for the Wii version because of the nunchucks for remote control.

1936
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Um, our next one, um, comes from GeekBoy2424.

1937
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Hi guys, I have come to a conclusion. I have ADHD.

1938
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Along with a little bit of OCD.

1939
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:52,000
My question for the week is, how do you guys stop yourselves because the only thing that works for me is playing games?

1940
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Uh, when is, okay, I guess when I sit at my desk I can't concentrate because I can't sit freaking still.

1941
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Help Dr. Orange Lounge. Sincerely, GeekBoy2424.

1942
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Okay, well if you seriously think you might have some type of, like, you know, attention deficit disorder, you might want to see a doctor.

1943
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
You know, as much as, you know, it strokes our gaming egos that you would email the show to talk about this,

1944
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
you really, really need to see a doctor if you think you actually have symptoms.

1945
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Like, I don't know if this is a joke, because I joke a lot of times on the show that I have gaming ADHD

1946
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
because I play a game for five minutes, then go, ooh, something shiny!

1947
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
And go play something else. Like, it happens all the time.

1948
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
But if, like, you're for real real, like, you have to play video games to get around your ADD that you think you have,

1949
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
you might want to see a doctor. I'm just saying, we can't diagnose that.

1950
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And that's a huge liability if we even tried to.

1951
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Now that Rob has said something responsible, I say self-medicate.

1952
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Play games all the time. Just, it's not going to kill you or anything. Just play them.

1953
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
When you're at your desk, what about your Game Boy?

1954
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,000
You know, if it calms you down and it makes you feel good, it's not like you're doing drugs or something, hook it up, man.

1955
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Just remember to go to the bathroom once in a while.

1956
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:05,000
When I was a young, hyperactive child, they used to make me drink coffee to calm down.

1957
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Because caffeine and, excuse me, caffeine, when you're already wired up and hyper, actually can be a sedative.

1958
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:20,000
What? I'm not giving medical advice. I'm just saying what I used to do.

1959
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I'm just saying coffee's delicious.

1960
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,000
That's not medical advice, by the way. That's just what I used to do.

1961
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Liability, liability, liability. No, I understand.

1962
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Anyway, but you know what? ADD is in your head.

1963
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I'm kidding.

1964
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Next email.

1965
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Hi, OLR. I'm sending this message from my iPod Touch with a cracked screen because my smart self dropped it on the ground while going from a friend's house to mine.

1966
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Anyway, I came to say hi because I've been listening to the podcast lately and laughed about the kid that threw a taco at his mom.

1967
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
By P.S.

1968
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Oh, he didn't put any spaces or anything.

1969
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:14,000
This message came from your friendly neighborhood MySpace friend, Eroka7, sent from my iPod.

1970
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
The end.

1971
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Can I interrupt? I got some kind of sad news I want to read.

1972
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I just was informed of this by a chatter who linked me to an article on Bamani style that was posted earlier today.

1973
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Jason Michael Bornstein, who is kind of known more out there as Stillwind in his name, passed away on Saturday night.

1974
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:45,000
He was a big part of the team at Konami of Hawaii, and he was the audio director of the Xbox series.

1975
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:53,000
And part of the reason why I'm stopping the whole show to mention this and just kind of take a minute to kind of soak this all in is that

1976
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I don't know if you guys remember back when we would do the podcast and the show itself, the radio show itself, as separate shows,

1977
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
but one year we had a big, big score that we had the universe soundtrack.

1978
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:12,000
We premiered those songs here on Orange Lawn's radio, and I think it was like UltraMix 4 at the time before anybody else got to hear them.

1979
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:19,000
That was Stillwind who coordinated all that with us here over email and was a big part, I know, of the fan community as well.

1980
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:29,000
So I'm just kind of, it does not, I'm just kind of shocked and saddened to hear it, and I'm sorry to depress everybody with this news,

1981
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:36,000
but I'm just finding it out myself, and this is sometimes the problems that you have when you do a live radio show is that you get live news.

1982
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I don't know, you know, Babani Style is a pretty respectable site. I don't see why they would lie about something like this, and just no.

1983
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:54,000
That would be very poor taste. So I'm pretty sure this is legit and very sad, and I don't know what else to say.

1984
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm very sorry to hear this for his family and everybody and for the community that will have really lost something with this.

1985
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
That's really sad news.

1986
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
So I'm very sorry to derail the mailbag with that sad news.

1987
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
He died from a ruptured aorta.

1988
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Oh, that is very sad.

1989
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Okay, but he did a lot for the show a couple years ago and did keep in touch a little while here and there, so I just wanted to pass that news along.

1990
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Sorry, please tell me the next email has like a dick and fart joke or something to bring the humor back to the show, because I really just killed it right there.

1991
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1992
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Well, hi folks. I just thought I'd throw in my proverbial two cents regarding the subject of rampant fanboyism that is often seen quite a lot on the net.

1993
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Personally, I think that no matter what systems one promotes or trashes fanboyism in any form just makes us gamers look like the mouth-breathing Cheetos dust encrusted inbred Neanderthals that non-gamers perceive us, and quite frankly, this kind of thing really needs to stop.

1994
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Big, long sentence. Wow.

1995
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Speaking as someone who has both the 360 and PS3, and a whole shit-ton of other systems from previous generations, I can honestly say the following.

1996
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
There's no such thing as a perfect system.

1997
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Either there's a flaw in the hardware itself, or there's a feature service, or some other aspect that another system does better.

1998
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Additionally, just because a given game isn't on one system of choice, that doesn't mean it's a crap game.

1999
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Conversely, just because a game is exclusive to one's favorite system, that doesn't make the game the greatest thing since the invention of breast implants.

2000
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Simply put, each system has strengths as well as weaknesses, good games as well as total turds.

2001
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,000
It helps to have multiple consoles so one has that much more options for gaming.

2002
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Amen to that.

2003
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Because you know what we always said on the show, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

2004
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
That sums it up right there. And that's from Spaznator.

2005
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Dreamcast, yo.

2006
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Dude, Dreamcast is turning 10 this year, can you believe it? I was just thinking about that. That's crazy.

2007
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I remember standing in line on September 9th, 1999.

2008
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It's interesting though that we do have three very distinct consoles that are out there right now, and all of them have decent games on them, and all of them have some pretty crap games on them.

2009
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
So you have two consoles and then you have the Wii.

2010
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:23,000
But even the Wii, you know, the Wii's got for it, for a particular audience, it has games people want.

2011
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Soccer moms and families, it's got a ton of stuff that people want.

2012
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:39,000
But the console war right now, and while it's not a war for first place because Nintendo's got that, the console war, the culture clash in gamers right now is PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360.

2013
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Just like last generation, GameCube was there, but it was really Xbox versus PS2.

2014
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And, I mean, I've been hitting the gaming forums for a long time, I don't just work in a game store, but I work in a game store because I'm a gamer.

2015
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,000
And, you know, the fanboyism is always going to be there.

2016
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I own every system, and I mean every system.

2017
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,000
They really do.

2018
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
In our defense, we do not own a Jaguar.

2019
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I would if I found one.

2020
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
But, hey dude, Tempest 2000 is sweet and aliens versus predators good.

2021
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Cybermorph is not too bad.

2022
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,000
But, back on the subject of fanboyism, I always have my favorites.

2023
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:32,000
You know, when it came down to Genesis versus Super Nintendo, I would argue Genesis for hours.

2024
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And my wife says Super Nintendo, they're both great, don't get me wrong, Genesis.

2025
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
But, quit worrying about it.

2026
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:46,000
You know, if you go onto a forum and you post about something on the 360, expect someone to say the PS3 is great.

2027
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,000
But, isn't it, and BlackWolf is in chat and makes a great point here.

2028
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
And, you know, the executives get into this shit too.

2029
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:59,000
Sony says that the PS3 is a leader because the Wii doesn't exist to them, and they don't consider the 360 reliable.

2030
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
So, they say that they win by default.

2031
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
They win because they're all, we refuse to acknowledge our competition, therefore we are the victors.

2032
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
We win because our system is made by Sony.

2033
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
He's also not making that up.

2034
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
They're also eating too much periwinkle.

2035
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
He's paraphrasing, but he's not making that up, what are you saying?

2036
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
And they're also eating too much burnt sienna.

2037
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
We are the number one Sony system on the planet.

2038
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
And that's fine. You know, the company is going to try to brainwash you anyway.

2039
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Sadly, no, the PlayStation 2 is.

2040
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
No, that's true. And the PSP. But, pick the system that you like and fight for it.

2041
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
What about the PlayStation 1?

2042
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Get on the forums and tell everyone who likes the other system that they are ass clowns.

2043
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That's right. I want to see more rap and feminism. Be into what you're doing.

2044
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Alright, Jamie's dying to read the last email, Jamie.

2045
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Dear Lord.

2046
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Last email.

2047
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
You brought him. You brought him.

2048
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
I know, I know, I know.

2049
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Dan, I love Dan.

2050
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I'll tell you one thing that Sony does win in, and this is absolutely, you can't really, I think, argue this.

2051
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
If the systems were used for blunt force trauma, they definitely would win.

2052
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Because that system is heavy and quite solid.

2053
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
360, it is pretty heavy, not quite as solid.

2054
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
The Wii, well, that's not very bad. Or not very good.

2055
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
You come after me with a PS3. I'll come after you with a 360 power supply.

2056
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,000
And we'll see who gets who.

2057
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
What?

2058
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Dan, please.

2059
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Okay, last email. At least Dan's rambling has mean I've gotten to eat more bread and get more crumbs in my cleavage.

2060
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Excuse me.

2061
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,000
No. Are you done?

2062
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Okay, last email.

2063
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Hey, OLR. Love the show. I never miss an episode on the podcast feed.

2064
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
It's tough for me to catch the live show because I live on the East Coast and have young twins.

2065
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I'm early to work on Monday morning, blah, blah, blah.

2066
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Basically, what I'm saying is that I have a tough time staying up as late as the show runs.

2067
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Oh, stop it with your sob story. No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding.

2068
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Also, I love the fact that you guys, in podcast form, help me through the monotonous parts of my office job.

2069
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Amen.

2070
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Lately, I've been sad that the feed has been so far behind.

2071
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Is there any way that you could update the feed more regularly?

2072
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I've been missing my OLR fix every week.

2073
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Yes, it got updated twice last week and will be updated twice this week and will be caught up.

2074
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
We're slowly catching up.

2075
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Again, it's just the side thing of having two computers running this thing off of.

2076
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
I just get far behind. I'm only one person.

2077
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
We're almost there.

2078
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Regardless, I appreciate your efforts as an independent podcast and wish you many more great episodes, Boston OLR fan.

2079
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I hear that a lot that we help people through the work week.

2080
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,000
I know it's kind of depressing when your three-hour show you relied on isn't there, so I'm trying, guys.

2081
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,000
We'll get caught up. We're almost there.

2082
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
So, great. Thanks for the emails, guys. Send us more.

2083
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2084
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I'm hijacking this mother.

2085
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Next week's mailbag. Did you love Dan? Did you hate Dan?

2086
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
There you go.

2087
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:13,000
It's good to get that out of the way next week because in two weeks it'll be all Street Fighter IV talk when it comes to Dan.

2088
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Word.

2089
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Loki, how about some more gaming news?

2090
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Yes, let's talk a little bit about Red Dead Redemption, the sequel to Red Dead Revolver, and it's going to be very awesome.

2091
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:33,000
It's actually going to be using the Rage engine again, so very similar to what they did with Grand Theft Auto IV.

2092
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:43,000
And, of course, they say that there's going to be the complete open world with strong plotlines in a massive, vibrant, rural environment.

2093
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
And it's supposed to be coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360. No sort of time frame, though.

2094
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Is that one out of left field or what?

2095
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
A little bit, yeah.

2096
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:59,000
How about a new bully game? Somebody was just asking me about that the other night in a car ride about bully. How about a new bully game?

2097
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
How about a new Warriors game? I'm sorry. The first Warriors game was awesome.

2098
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
You get the Xbox Live one?

2099
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
No, that's unacceptable. That's crap.

2100
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I'm sure another bully will happen.

2101
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Because it was good, and it sold. But, seriously, it's like, how many years ago was Red Dead Revolver?

2102
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Yeah, that's true.

2103
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:23,000
That was like four years ago. So, I mean, you know, bullies still got two, three more years before we need a sequel for it.

2104
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
But then remember when we got Excite Truck?

2105
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Excite Truck was, like, great.

2106
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Dude, I know Excite Truck was awesome, but I'm just saying, like, dude, how many years ago was Excite Bike?

2107
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I don't even see Excite Truck, and Excite Bike is even remotely similar.

2108
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
The games play completely different, but they are kind of like, you know, they do.

2109
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
It makes me happy that Nintendo used the prefix Excite again.

2110
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Because it did excite me.

2111
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:51,000
For the third time. You got Excite Bike, Excite Bike 64, which is sweet, and if that's on a virtual console it should be,

2112
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:56,000
and Excite Truck, which is actually the best driving game on the Wii, right there with Mario.

2113
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Now they need Excite Tank.

2114
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Oh, dude, sweet.

2115
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Because nothing excites me more than the thought of driving a tank.

2116
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Or actually, Excite Truck with, like, a battle mode would be pretty awesome.

2117
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Excite Humvee.

2118
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Or, hey, let's take it even better.

2119
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Instead of an Excite Bike, or Excite Truck sequel, just do another Excite Truck game, but, like, with Mario stuff.

2120
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Like, making it like a Mario Kart off-road racing game.

2121
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
No! Shut up!

2122
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
It doesn't need, we don't need, Mario's everywhere already.

2123
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Excite Truck 2.

2124
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
It'll be very simple. Or just a new F-Zero, for God's sake.

2125
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
You know what?

2126
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
I'm sorry, yes, Star-Star?

2127
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Excite Jet Ski.

2128
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Isn't that in Wii Sports? Isn't the new Wii Sports, what do they call it, Wii Sport Resort or whatever it's called?

2129
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Yeah.

2130
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Doesn't that have a Jet Ski thing in it?

2131
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Yes, it does.

2132
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I think it does.

2133
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Wave Race 65.

2134
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,000
SSJ100 Matt is flash-forwarding to E3 this year.

2135
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Nelly, that's Matt's wife, Nelly interviewing Reggie.

2136
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Why the fuck aren't you making Excite Truck 2?

2137
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I would totally...

2138
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Sad thing is, Nelly will have no idea who the hell Reggie is, so if that were to actually happen, it could.

2139
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
GS68 suggested Excite Butt.

2140
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
No, you can't drive a butt.

2141
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Alright, look.

2142
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
How about Excite Obama?

2143
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Because, you know, Obama...

2144
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Obama is exciting.

2145
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Obama excited a lot of people with his inauguration, election and all that, and is showing up in video games, apparently.

2146
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Go figure.

2147
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
And this is in Street Fighter Online, Mouse Generation.

2148
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:35,000
This is not necessarily the same Street Fighter that you know and love over here.

2149
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:39,000
You know, this is an online one that's been going on for quite some time.

2150
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Some Valentine's Day, they have some chocolate-covered avatars that are being released.

2151
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Okay, whatever, but what's more kind of thought-provoking is the fact that there's a new character,

2152
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:58,000
and he bears a resemblance to a certain presidential figure very recently, and he's called...

2153
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
By the way, the pack is called the Yes We Can Pack.

2154
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
If that doesn't tell you anything, I don't know what to tell you.

2155
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And that's the most offensive version of Obama that I've ever seen.

2156
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
It really is. That is very offensive.

2157
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
But it's Japanese, so people go, it's cute.

2158
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
I'll show you.

2159
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
He has some serious buck teeth.

2160
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Dark skin, short hair, come on.

2161
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
It's just the whole, you know, but it's just...

2162
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,000
You know, I don't think anyone's going to truly be offended by it.

2163
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
It's Obama and his chocolate hair.

2164
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
That's interesting.

2165
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Is this Street Fighter Online? This isn't like a Capcom product.

2166
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
If he's meeting a Bush, I'll download it.

2167
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
I don't...

2168
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I pay money to see that shit.

2169
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Obama Punch!

2170
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Maybe if they put Sarah Palin in it, I don't know.

2171
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
No, apparently, this is from a Japanese publisher.

2172
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:48,000
The name of the publisher is Diletto, and they are co-owned by Capcom and Games Arena.

2173
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
So this is like, this is like a Capcom thing.

2174
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
This is like an official product.

2175
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Sorta.

2176
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
But in another country.

2177
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Like, you know, in Japan, in Marvel Superheroes vs. Street Fighter, on the Saturn,

2178
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
there was a character that they couldn't have anywhere else in the world,

2179
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,000
because he was copyrighted, I guess.

2180
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Norimaro, right?

2181
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
He was like a comedian.

2182
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Man, wouldn't it be sweet if there was a hidden American character and it was Obama?

2183
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,000
What would be Obama's special power in this game?

2184
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
We don't know.

2185
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Well, according to DJ Dark Knight in chat, a veto uppercut.

2186
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,000
He would have all of Sagat's moves, so he'd immediately be god tier.

2187
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
And I mean, he would just be like, veto, veto.

2188
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
I just had this image of Sagat, but actually, as Dick Cheney,

2189
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
like, in a special movie, waterboarding.

2190
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Nice.

2191
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Or shooting you with a gun, as Dick Cheney.

2192
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,000
He would start off, like, in, gosh, which game was it where he was?

2193
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Where's Sagat?

2194
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Start off holding like Dan, and then he'd throw him aside,

2195
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
but he'd start off and be like Bush.

2196
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Wasn't there, like, a guile move?

2197
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Like, it was a rumored guile move, they'd pull out a pistol or something

2198
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
and, like, shoot somebody?

2199
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
That was, like, an urban fucking legend.

2200
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Some kid at the arcade knew a kid who saw a kid pull out a gun.

2201
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
But now with Dick Cheney.

2202
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Yeah, Dick Cheney.

2203
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
But he'd only shoot his partner in the face.

2204
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Now, a hidden character in this, would this be,

2205
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
would Hillary Clinton come out of the woodwork and, like,

2206
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,000
mix some shit up with this?

2207
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I don't know what her special character is.

2208
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Or Sarah Palin might come out, who knows?

2209
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Ariel Wolf shooting right there.

2210
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Here's the thing, the chat room is quick to point out,

2211
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
there is an Obama Japan.

2212
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
There is an Obama Japan, according to chat,

2213
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
and I did remember seeing that on TV when he won.

2214
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
They were, you know, showing how excited they were in Japan and all that, so.

2215
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
All right, anyhow, if you want to join the festivities,

2216
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
chat.orangelandtrader.com, and I apologize to the folks on Justin TV

2217
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,000
because I just clicked over there and I see, like, the chat is filling up there.

2218
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Like, you have Deathwishing says Excitebike64 is my favorite game on the N64.

2219
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,000
It was a good game.

2220
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
And sorry guys, it's just really hard for us to watch two chat rooms at the same time

2221
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,000
and do a show, so sometimes Justin TV gets ignored, so I apologize.

2222
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
But definitely join our main chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com

2223
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
and we'll read more of your comments as we can.

2224
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
All right.

2225
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news, shall we, Jimmy?

2226
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Yes.

2227
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
If, God, the wind doesn't blow the garage door clear over, what?

2228
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
It's like...

2229
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
World of Warcraft!

2230
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
God is Obama uppercutting the door.

2231
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
What about WoW?

2232
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
There's going to be some changes.

2233
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:22,000
In the next World of Warcraft patch, we'll have some class changes, actually.

2234
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Again?

2235
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:29,000
There is no more consumable ammunition for hunters.

2236
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,000
A boost of protection spec paladins.

2237
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,000
For real?

2238
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Like, you don't have to get arrows anymore or whatever?

2239
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
That makes me happy.

2240
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
That's strange.

2241
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Major improvements to the priest class, especially in group healing.

2242
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
General buffs for rogues and shamans.

2243
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Efficiency improvements for warriors and warlocks, with penalty for warriors changing stances being much lighter.

2244
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Plus mana regeneration being reigned in across the board.

2245
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Sweet!

2246
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Somewhere an arms warrior is rejoicing.

2247
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
You can actually find more information on it on WoW Insider.

2248
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
They've got the specifics listed.

2249
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:15,000
But basically, they're trying to just streamline all the classes, trying to bring all the tanking classes in line.

2250
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Level, basically just trying to balance the game.

2251
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:25,000
And also make the boss fights more challenging by decreasing the mana regeneration.

2252
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
The content has not gone into testing yet.

2253
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
It should be going in before the release in the next couple of months.

2254
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
So, keep your eyes out.

2255
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,000
If any of our readers find out more, let us know.

2256
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Also, in patch 3.1, there will be a new raid dungeon called Ulduar, with an introduction of dual talent specializations.

2257
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Thank god! About fucking time.

2258
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,000
That's the rumor.

2259
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Well, after the 3.0.8 patch where hunters got nerfed hardcore, I guess this is a sad consolation that,

2260
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,000
oh, we'll no longer have to make you buy arrows ever again.

2261
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I guess that's the consolation that we get as hunters, or huntards, as I like to call myself.

2262
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
It hurts my feelings that I understood some of that.

2263
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Matt2, do you think this will be enough to get me back to WoW?

2264
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Yes, short of me paying for your account again or whatever to do to get you playing back to the world of warcrack.

2265
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I actually kind of think that I want to start playing again just for a little bit.

2266
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Even though my last character was level 10.

2267
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:28,000
But as Rob pointed out at the beginning of the show, all 20 of my characters, which is really 9 of them, are all Nar'zhul.

2268
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Have you been gone for more than 3 months?

2269
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Let me get you a scroll of resurrection because then we can get the uber item that lets us level up really quickly.

2270
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
You'll get my scroll.

2271
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Stay strong. Don't start playing again.

2272
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
No, no.

2273
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Just don't do it.

2274
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
You're better off without it. It's like smoking. You just don't need that.

2275
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Yeah, but WoW doesn't cause cancer.

2276
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
That's what you think.

2277
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Of course, our stigmatisms in our eyes might get worse and worse.

2278
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Dan thinks that it causes cancer to the sequel.

2279
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Is that cancer to electric boogaloo? What is this?

2280
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Whatever.

2281
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,000
It's because it's not cool to say that things cause cancer because people are dying of cancer.

2282
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
So I started saying that things cause cancer too.

2283
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Well, WoW causes electric boogaloo. It makes sense.

2284
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
WoW causes electric boogaloo.

2285
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
It's serious though. Don't start playing.

2286
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I don't know, but a new race engine...

2287
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
You can be so much more about games when you don't play WoW.

2288
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
That's true. I play so many more games when I'm not playing WoW.

2289
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
You don't even know.

2290
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Satrombone.

2291
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Yes, satrombone. Low key.

2292
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Well, this is totally as far away from World of Warcraft as possible.

2293
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Battlefield 1943 is now slated to come out on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and Playstation Network this summer.

2294
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:50,000
It is going to be based on the same engine as Bad Company and will feature 24 player battles.

2295
02:07:50,000 --> 02:08:00,000
And they had a few different maps, including Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima, which are based off of actual world locations.

2296
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I think they actually used some of the topography maps and stuff like that for that.

2297
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
So, neat, I guess.

2298
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Also, around the same time, I believe they announced Battlefield Bad Company 2 as well.

2299
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Because really, if gaming needed anything besides more MMORPGs, it's more FPSs.

2300
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Thank God.

2301
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I think, if I remember correctly, Bad Company 2 is right now for September.

2302
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Now, TigerClaw says it's nice for them to go back to the World War 2 roots.

2303
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Since, obviously, they can't really do the modern warfare stuff now because Call of Duty has owned it.

2304
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I do want to go back previously because this comment is pretty funny on the past story about WoW.

2305
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Rama in chat says WoW may not cause cancer, but it can cause breakups, cheating, and marriage counseling.

2306
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I have heard that.

2307
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
But the family that raids together stays together.

2308
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Alright, that's my counter-argument.

2309
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I am not going back to WoW.

2310
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I'm going to play Perfect World because I said I was going to play Perfect World.

2311
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
For 30 days and you'll come play WoW.

2312
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I've been off of WoW for how long?

2313
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
At it? And you're not even playing anymore?

2314
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I'm not even playing right now. Why am I trying to recruit people?

2315
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Alright, because I know Matt 2 is going to succeed in his efforts to try and get me back.

2316
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Yes, I am.

2317
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Anyhow, going back to EA.

2318
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I am, really.

2319
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
And their conference call they had.

2320
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
News about Battlefield was not the only thing to come out of it and some of the things we talked about in Part A.

2321
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:44,000
But also Mass Effect has been confirmed that Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.

2322
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
It's not going to be Xbox exclusive.

2323
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
That's straight out of the mouth of CEO John Riccitello.

2324
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.

2325
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Also, Bad Company, the other Battlefield game, will be back on consoles in the year 2010.

2326
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
So, some point like January to March, but who knows?

2327
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Really? I thought it was 2009, but I guess it's going to be delayed a lot more.

2328
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Probably even more than that.

2329
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
What, Mass Effect?

2330
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
No, the other one. The Battlefield Bad Company.

2331
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I thought Mass Effect was a Microsoft Game Studios owned franchise.

2332
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I didn't think Bioware carried it over with them.

2333
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Well, here's the thing, and I bet Black Wolf and Chad is right. He's saying it right.

2334
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
He's saying exactly what I'm thinking.

2335
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Multiple platform equals Xbox 360 and PC.

2336
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I bet you that's exactly what it is.

2337
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Doesn't mean suddenly we're going to see PS3.

2338
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
And plus, we've also seen, you know, who knows?

2339
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
You might get a Mass Effect spinoff on the DS.

2340
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Because we have seen that Microsoft is not opposed to letting their stuff go on, yeah, less effect.

2341
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Dual effect.

2342
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Seeing things go on the DS, Viva Pinata had a game on the DS, so it's possible.

2343
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
No, not Viva Pinata, Mech Assault.

2344
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,000
That would be an awesome game, like a mech game, but they're just giant pinatas.

2345
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Well, they've done Mech Assault on the DS, and it was not very good.

2346
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
But they did it. It was a Microsoft franchise.

2347
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
They did it. It was a Microsoft franchise.

2348
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
That's all I'm saying.

2349
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:17,000
But I was a completely different game, but it's kind of big like some of these Mass Effect games and stuff.

2350
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Borderlands, I actually watched some gameplay footage of.

2351
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,000
And that thing's going to be epic, and I think it's going to catch a lot of people off guard.

2352
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Because it's almost like Oblivion and Fallout with just a lot more fast-paced first-person gameplay and vehicles.

2353
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
And Mad Max.

2354
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Alrighty then.

2355
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Well, let's move a little bit away from that world and go to a different kind of virtual world altogether.

2356
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
The world of Sims.

2357
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I love The Sims, because I like building houses apparently, and then not doing anything.

2358
02:11:50,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Sims 3 actually has been talked about, but it's been delayed from the February 20th release date to sometime in early June.

2359
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:11,000
They're actually speculating June 2nd, with the non-PC versions being sometime later than that.

2360
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:22,000
They're also saying that the games will be released on PC and Mac and iPhone, iPhone Touch, and other mobiles.

2361
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
But the release date only really goes for the PC version.

2362
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
So, oh well.

2363
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Yeah, too bad.

2364
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Well, I mean, they're delaying a lot of stuff, so not surprised.

2365
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And you know what?

2366
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
News of all these game delays.

2367
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I don't know about you guys, but I just get ticked off when I hear about all these game delays.

2368
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Because, you know, I get my hopes up to play these awesome sounding games, and then, aha, gotcha, delayed.

2369
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:54,000
And, you know, when I get ticked off like this, we start playing the angry music, and it causes the angry segment of our show to happen called the FUs of the Week.

2370
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Music

2371
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
FU.

2372
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Yes, this is the FUs of the Week.

2373
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
The best part of the show.

2374
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:27,000
FU to my work for deciding that I need to help back up people on the phones, even though I don't get a single damn call, and it'll really suck because I've been having a really bad sore throat from my sinus infection.

2375
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:33,000
So, FU to the phones and talk to the people.

2376
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:46,000
FU the person that parks next to me at my apartment complex because they're parking right on the line and they haven't moved their car in like four days, and so it makes it almost impossible for me to get out of my car.

2377
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:53,000
I would really do some damage to their car, but someone's already keyed it, so apparently they do this other places as well, so.

2378
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Ah, fuck them.

2379
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I actually don't have a lot of FUs of the Week.

2380
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I had a pretty good week, so FU to me being so happy, I suppose.

2381
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:07,000
But, um, FU to, I'll say this, FU to sleeping in until noon and still feeling tired.

2382
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I hate that. Have you ever had that where you sleep so freaking much?

2383
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Although that's not the case because I didn't go to bed until five last night, but I have had this happen before where, like, you sleep so much that your eyes hurt and you're still tired.

2384
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
I've had that happen. That sucks. FU to that.

2385
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Okay, Dan, do you have any FUs of the Week you want to share?

2386
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
FU to people who get bent about push release dates.

2387
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:36,000
There's other shit to play. Find a different game. Seriously. Those dates don't even exist for you.

2388
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Those are for retailers, like me, so I know when they're coming out and I know when to start pushing the product.

2389
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
You're not even supposed to know them! FU all.

2390
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Dan, we just have to work in this segment somewhere in the show, so just wait a second.

2391
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:53,000
You die. You die twice. I hope you get electric boogaloo.

2392
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
FU to being alive.

2393
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Matt, too! Do you have any FUs of the Week you'd like to share?

2394
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I haven't thought this far ahead, but I guess FU to Weemageddon, the potential impending Weemageddon that may cause more console wars with each other.

2395
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:11,000
And the Jerry Breckenheimer movie that will follow called Weemageddon.

2396
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
That's right. That's right. It'll make millions upon millions of dollars.

2397
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:20,000
But I do agree that there are two main primary consoles in the Wii U for that one special demographic.

2398
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
FU to you for stealing my stolen word.

2399
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:28,000
FU, because you thought that first and I happened to say it.

2400
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
It's not even copyright.

2401
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
That's why I said I stole it, and then you stole it from me.

2402
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Alright, FU both.

2403
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
And then you stole it from him.

2404
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
FU both. We're getting back into the news.

2405
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Loki doesn't even want it anymore.

2406
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,000
We'll add a prefix to FU. S-T-F-U.

2407
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Oh, snap.

2408
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Oooh.

2409
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Alright, Loki. Do we have any more gaming news? I hope so.

2410
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Yes. I was going to say, I'm going to now copyright Super Weemageddon.

2411
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,000
The Super Weemageddon.

2412
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Well, a game that will not be featured on the Super Weemageddon 64 will be Puzzle Quest Galactrix.

2413
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Really? Because they do manage to port those Puzzle Quest games to everything.

2414
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
It is sad.

2415
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
It could be on Super Weemageddon 64 already.

2416
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,000
It will be coming out on DSPC, Xbox Live Arcade.

2417
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Apparently the PC version is coming around on February 24th.

2418
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:29,000
The Xbox Live Arcade date is unconfirmed, but you know me being the guessing man that I am.

2419
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I would say since the, I don't know, maybe probably the week after.

2420
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Puzzle Quest is cool. I was really afraid you were going to say it was cancelled.

2421
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
It's cancelled.

2422
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
No.

2423
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
What? No Atari 2600 port?

2424
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
It's cancelled for Christmas, and Christmas is cancelled as well.

2425
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Puzzle Quest is awesome.

2426
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Happy Hanukkah!

2427
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Although where the Galactrix thing comes from, I don't even know.

2428
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Galactrix comes from the fact that the game is different and it's set in space now.

2429
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
And they changed the engine. Like, you know, now it's the whole hexagonal thing.

2430
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
But it's pretty cool, actually. If you've played the demo, it's pretty addicting, I think.

2431
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Just put friggin' Puzzle Pirates on Xbox Live Arcade game.

2432
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously.

2433
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It's really meant to be a portable game, though. I can't see sitting there.

2434
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Yeah, Puzzle Pirates would be an awesome DS, like, MMO.

2435
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
I can't see playing, like, Puzzle Quest on my 360.

2436
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,000
But I could totally see playing that on the PSP.

2437
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Also, out of EA, some other news. It's not related to Puzzle Quest, but one other little piece of news that's out of EA.

2438
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Apparently, they are now going to be getting the Bourne series over there.

2439
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Or, I guess what's going on, it's not just really the Bourne.

2440
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,000
What's happened, they've picked up the rights to publish games that are based on Robert Ludlam stories.

2441
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
He is the guy who made the Jason Bourne series.

2442
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:53,000
So, apparently the first game in the series is going to be made by Star Breeze Studios.

2443
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
No word on exactly what that game is, but...

2444
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Because the first game was so awesome that they really needed to make a sequel to it?

2445
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,000
You know, I'm not surprised these games sell pretty well, though, because the Bourne series is kind of one of those series that...

2446
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,000
You know, a lot of people don't talk about it, but a lot of people watch these movies.

2447
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,000
You know, all of them broke 100 million at the box office.

2448
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Matt Damon!

2449
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
They all do very well, yes, because of Matt Damon.

2450
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
What other books has he written? I mean, I'm not really familiar with...

2451
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
It is a Bourne title they're working on, by the way.

2452
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I'll start with The Bourne, and end with, like, something.

2453
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
The Bourne Cakery.

2454
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Nice.

2455
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Okay. The Bourne Cooking Mama. No, I don't know.

2456
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:43,000
So, there you have it. EA has picked up the Bourne rights, and who knows what else from the same author.

2457
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,000
The Bourne Oven.

2458
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,000
I like this idea of picking up rights to authors' stories, though.

2459
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Like, could you imagine, like, you know, J.D. Salinger rights getting picked up?

2460
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,000
We'd have The Catcher in the Rye game.

2461
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Hey, we've had Discworld games before.

2462
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Roald Dahl gets picked up. We could finally have Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, the game.

2463
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:04,000
It'd be pretty amazing.

2464
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:09,000
It was certainly better than that shit-tastic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory game they put out a couple years ago.

2465
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I'm picking up the rights to the Bible.

2466
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Sorry, those little offshoot companies already did Bible adventures. Hello?

2467
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I don't know if, like, God's rights are for sale.

2468
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,000
I pick the...

2469
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
I'm so glad you didn't have a mic when you said that.

2470
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I pick the rights to the gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster game.

2471
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,000
I am going to do a Flying Spaghetti Monster game.

2472
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Fine, I'm buying the rights to the articles in Playboy.

2473
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Seriously, if you want to make a badass game, license the Oblivion Engine and the Bible.

2474
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,000
And just combine them. How fucking nuts would that be?

2475
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Or as Frisbee puts in the chat, SuperChristPuncher64.

2476
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Jesus, punch!

2477
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
And if you die, you just get resurrected.

2478
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
You don't really have to buy the rights to the Bible. I think it's in public domain.

2479
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
So if you wanted to make that game, you could make it.

2480
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Then why do they sell Bibles on TV?

2481
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
No, seriously, I'm selling the rights to the Bible.

2482
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,000
If you want to buy a Bible, I'm your man.

2483
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Ray Bradbury, you go around burning books in, like, Fahrenheit 451. I can just see it now.

2484
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Please, more gaming news that isn't related to religion.

2485
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Flying Spaghetti Monster.

2486
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children.

2487
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I said not religion.

2488
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,000
For some people, Final Fantasy VII is a religion.

2489
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
These people need lives.

2490
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:52,000
At any rate, the Blu-Ray edition of the movie will have a dub soundtrack.

2491
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Which is why I'm importing that bitch.

2492
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:59,000
And not because Final Fantasy XIII demo is going to be on there at all.

2493
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Oh no, not for that or anything.

2494
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:05,000
No, never for that. No, it's going to have an option.

2495
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:08,000
I do want the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

2496
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:17,000
But it actually, if you do buy that Blu-Ray version though, it's going to have the English voice track.

2497
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Did you download the HD Final Fantasy XIII trailer on PlayStation 3?

2498
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
No.

2499
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I seriously think I got a boner from watching that trailer. It was pretty hot.

2500
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Noise.

2501
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I'm hearing way too much about cocks on this show tonight.

2502
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
At least we've had a mention of boobs.

2503
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Speaking of cocks, Guns N' Roses Chinese...

2504
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Wow, Loki just won best transition ever. Congratulations.

2505
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Guns N' Roses Chinese Democracy album is coming to Rock Band this spring.

2506
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Yeah, no word on the price, but it's coming.

2507
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Don't worry, it's going to be delayed.

2508
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:10,000
It's going to be coming actually February 28th, so that's kind of soon.

2509
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:19,000
And then also, Rock Band is going to be getting some new download content with the re-release of Pearl Jam's X album.

2510
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:24,000
They're going to have a code for three bonus tracks in Rock Band.

2511
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Very similar to what they did with System of the Down.

2512
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I think they had three tracks that were available with their album as well.

2513
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,000
So you can probably bet that these will be available as well later on.

2514
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
But the three tracks will be available for free download.

2515
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Brother, Alive, and State of Love and Trust.

2516
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Rock Band is costing themselves some serious cool points.

2517
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:49,000
First was the janky way you had to pay 40 bucks for ACDC Live, which you can get for 30 bucks now.

2518
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:52,000
The second is the whole Chinese democracy thing.

2519
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Come on, quit trying to stuff like these giant packs on us.

2520
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
It's terrible. Terrible stuff.

2521
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Making us buy ACDs. Just put them up on the network. Come on.

2522
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Well, it's going to be on the network. The Chinese democracy thing is going to be on the network.

2523
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Yeah, but see, that just sucks.

2524
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
It's not that I'm trying to say it's like, oh, they're doing it that way.

2525
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I'm just trying to say it's like, come on, bring us something that's relevant that we want.

2526
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Axl doesn't deserve to be rewarded. Axl deserves to be punched in the face.

2527
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:26,000
And the ACDC thing, I want ACDC Live, but I don't want to pay 30 bucks for it.

2528
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:29,000
When it hits 20 at Walmart, I'm there.

2529
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I'm excited about Pearl Jam. That is their single best and only fantastic album.

2530
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
How long is that album? Are we out?

2531
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Yes.

2532
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:43,000
That is one of the last CDs that I have ever owned.

2533
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:46,000
That every damn track on it was fantastic.

2534
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Can we seriously get a Journey album right now?

2535
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
No shit.

2536
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Seriously?

2537
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
And it's not that Pearl Jam isn't good.

2538
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
It's just that Journey's better.

2539
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Right. But I don't want to buy 10 again so I can get three rock band songs.

2540
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:03,000
And yes, there's a there's a egregious dearth of Journey.

2541
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
There needs to be way more of it.

2542
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Every Journey song would be great.

2543
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
For real. That's what they need to be selling at Walmart, is the Journey game.

2544
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
What is the one that's on...

2545
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Any way you want it, that's the way you need it.

2546
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
That's great. But I mean, there's...

2547
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
So much more. So much more.

2548
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,000
A little more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2549
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,000
We love our music game roots and we have to mention music games whenever we see new ones.

2550
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,000
That's right.

2551
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
I don't know if this one exactly would qualify.

2552
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
It's a game called D-Pad Hero.

2553
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:39,000
That's right. There's so much love out there for Guitar Hero and everything that this whole thing started.

2554
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:43,000
That they have actually made a retro demake, not a remake.

2555
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I don't know how you feel. I know you love remakes.

2556
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I don't know how you feel about demakes though.

2557
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:52,000
D-Pad Hero. That's right. It's Guitar Hero, but you use the D-Pad to play the game.

2558
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
And actually, there's actually a little video that leaked on YouTube here.

2559
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I shouldn't say leaked, but they actually put it out here kind of showing how the game works.

2560
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
If you're hearing the noises in the background there, that's what I'm trying to load here in studio.

2561
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,000
Although it's kind of having a hard time buffering.

2562
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I was so sure you said D-Bag Hero at first. I didn't even...

2563
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Like Douchebag Hero?

2564
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:16,000
I don't think that would play exactly the same way.

2565
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I was like, what? Oh. Oh, okay.

2566
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:22,000
No, not D-Bag Hero. D-Pad Hero.

2567
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Sorry. Enunciate.

2568
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Alright, I just need to clean my ears or something.

2569
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Anyhow, I don't know why the video's not working, but it's not.

2570
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
But apparently you have all these different...

2571
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
But the thing is that you actually...

2572
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
You guys know he's making that up, right?

2573
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
You actually get these music things in NES style.

2574
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:44,000
So it actually has, speaking of Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine that you can actually play in like it's NES style.

2575
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,000
There you go. I really want to see if we can get a...

2576
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Because they actually have this too.

2577
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:54,000
They have Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger in this game as well by Daft Punk.

2578
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Let me see if one of these other videos will work here a little better.

2579
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Let's see, here's a little...

2580
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
And these little things fall down.

2581
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Looks like you actually hold the D-Pad in a certain direction when you push the button.

2582
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
So it does have a little bit of a challenge to it.

2583
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
And there actually is a little audience that rocks out.

2584
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:21,000
See, there's like one guy bobbing up and down there in the background.

2585
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
This song is awesome.

2586
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:31,000
This is actually a pretty faithful remake of the song.

2587
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:34,000
And Amae Satsuma in chat says,

2588
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:43,000
He wants Tea Bag Hero. I don't know about that. Featuring an all Madonna soundtrack. I don't know about that.

2589
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Alright, that's going to do it for news right now.

2590
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Let's go to the Skype line, but actually we're going to take a call right off the top here.

2591
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
We actually have some people sitting there waiting on hold.

2592
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Callers, you guys there?

2593
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Yeah, we're here.

2594
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Hi. Hello, hello. This is Rama and SSJ100 Matt, correct?

2595
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Yep, we're here.

2596
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:04,000
So why are you kids calling us tonight? What's going on?

2597
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
New York Comic Con.

2598
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Ah, that's right. Of course, our New York City listeners.

2599
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I'm sure you guys were banging down the doors of New York Comic Con.

2600
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
How was it? Tell us about it, you guys.

2601
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
You first, Matt.

2602
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Well, I had a lot of fun.

2603
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I mean, this is the first Comic Con I went to because this is the first time I've been back in New York for a long time.

2604
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:32,000
But, Comic Con has kind of turned itself into, you know, a normal comic convention into, you know, just a whole geek fest of everything.

2605
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And now, this year, they kind of expanded the game section.

2606
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,000
So now half the convention is more so video game stuff.

2607
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:46,000
And they had a lot of new games there that I was excited to play, so.

2608
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:52,000
That's cool. It sounds like it's practically turning into the San Diego Comic Con because they don't really talk about comics at the San Diego.

2609
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
No, they do. But, I mean, a lot of it is Hollywood panels.

2610
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Like, when I heard there was a Sarah Silverman show panel at Comic Con, I'm like, what the fuck does that have to do with comics? Nothing.

2611
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
We read comic books, so we should have a panel. I don't know.

2612
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Comic Con has long since been perverted away from comic books.

2613
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Apparently. But that's okay. We like gaming, so that's pretty cool.

2614
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:18,000
And I just want to point out, guys, as well, since we are kind of getting used to this whole new Skype setup,

2615
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:24,000
they can't hear the Skype calls on Justin.tv, and that's just one of the downsides to the way things are wired now and have the better sound quality.

2616
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:29,000
So, sadly, if you want to hear both ends of the call, you have to be tuned into All Games Radio, where we're turning in live.

2617
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Sorry, guys. We'll see if we can fix that in the future, but can't do it right now while we're on a call.

2618
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
So tell us about the types. What games did you guys get out there and actually play?

2619
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Well, actually, to tell you the truth, it was very, very easy to play a lot of the games.

2620
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I was surprised, because I went there on Saturday, where it was the busy, busy day, where everyone was there.

2621
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:56,000
So I had to wait about 15 minutes, probably, per game to get up a game.

2622
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:02,000
But I could spend the entire call talking about every single game there, but I'll just talk about three.

2623
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:10,000
The three that I got a chance to play were MadWorld, which is coming out for the Wii.

2624
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:18,000
If anyone hasn't seen it, it's kind of like if Sin City was a Wii game.

2625
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Interesting. So this is a nice departure from Wii Mageddon, which has been talked about earlier, and I've heard about this game before.

2626
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:26,000
MadWorld, Dan?

2627
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
MadWorld. We got to check it out last September.

2628
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,000
You a fan?

2629
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:33,000
It's pretty hardcore for a Wii game.

2630
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:40,000
It's kind of got a Killer7 vibe, if anyone's checked out Killer7, but it's hyper-violent.

2631
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:45,000
It's all black and white, except for when you're laying out some carnage and then you get a lot of blood.

2632
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Definitely one of the coolest titles for the Wii.

2633
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
What did you think, Matt?

2634
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I thought it was great.

2635
02:29:52,000 --> 02:30:06,000
They had a challenge in the game where you basically have to shove guys into a pit, and every couple of minutes a giant thing just drops down and crushes everything in the pit.

2636
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:15,000
It was funny. Every single time you throw a guy in, they get crushed. A pool of blood slowly fills up, and more guys you throw in there, they start drowning in the blood.

2637
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:21,000
It's a pretty brutal game, and it might get me to buy a Wii game.

2638
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Interesting. All right. That's a pretty hearty endorsement. What else did you check out?

2639
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Another game which I think Loki would be interested in is Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars for the DS.

2640
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,000
I heard this was out on the floor. What did you think?

2641
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:51,000
When I originally heard they were going to make a Grand Theft Auto DS game, I was kind of skeptical, but when I got a chance to play it, I got admitted. It's a pretty good game.

2642
02:30:51,000 --> 02:31:07,000
It kind of goes back to the old top-down GTAs, like GTA 2, but the animation is very smooth and everything. It's got a lot of cute gimmicks in it.

2643
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:16,000
If you're calling for a cab, you basically whistle into the DS for the cab. It's got a lot of cool things like that.

2644
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Is there any special thing for when you want to get the hooker to blow you in the shooter?

2645
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:27,000
You've got to hold some money up in front of it and crinkle the dollars together.

2646
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Seriously though, if you want to see what Grand Theft Auto is going to look like when it's on Nintendo 64, there you go. Chinatown Wars, baby.

2647
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:44,000
They've got a little thing in there where it's like Dope Wars, if you kind of remember that from old handheld calculators and all that.

2648
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:48,000
That Dope Wars was awesome.

2649
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Loki, anything you want to say about the Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?

2650
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Looks neat. I'm planning on playing it.

2651
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
What was the third game?

2652
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:03,000
The third game, which I consider was the best game there, was the Ghostbusters game.

2653
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I've heard some good things about this. Tell us a little bit about the Ghostbusters game. What's it like?

2654
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:18,000
It's kind of like what everyone seems to think it is. It looks and feels like Gears of War, but with Ghostbusters.

2655
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
What version did they have there?

2656
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:31,000
They had every single version. They had the PS3, the 360, and the Wii version. The Wii version is the only one that looks different. It kind of looks a little more cartoony than the others.

2657
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:38,000
It's just as fun. I managed to get to play the Wii and the 360.

2658
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I heard that the Wii was an FPS version where you use your remote to capture ghosts and your nunchuck for movement.

2659
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,000
The 360 version is more like a third person shooter.

2660
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:56,000
You basically use the nunchuck to throw the trap and all that.

2661
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
That's awesome.

2662
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Matt, I've been letting you do all the talking, but Rama, did you go too? What did you check out?

2663
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I was mostly in the dealer's room, but I was able to check out one game. I think it's a game that everybody loves. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in Time.

2664
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:20,000
It was there to celebrate the 25th shell-a-versary of the Ninja Turtles.

2665
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:27,000
The shell-a-versary. I heard there was an old school Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine there.

2666
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Yes, and there were crowds upon crowds for people to jump in and play.

2667
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Isn't that sad that with all these new games that are making their debut there, you have Jumpgate and Prototype and Madworld and WrestleMania and Conduit.

2668
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:46,000
People are lining up to play TMNT 2, the arcade game.

2669
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Because quality persists. That is an amazing game.

2670
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
I'd be in line playing that.

2671
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:02,000
The last E3 we got to go to, there was a DDR and 2DX machine that year and there were people that were playing it all day long.

2672
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:05,000
And I'm like, dude, you guys are at E3 and you're playing fucking DDR?

2673
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Was that a recent mix of 2DX or was it like an old one?

2674
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:16,000
It was a mix of 2DX that you can't really get at the time. Wasn't here yet.

2675
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:19,000
But the DDR mix I don't think was anything new. I think they just had Supernova.

2676
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
So it was kind of surprising.

2677
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Was it Supernova 2? I don't remember. It was a while ago.

2678
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
It was a while ago.

2679
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Anyway, enough about a years old con.

2680
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Actually, I don't think it was Supernova 2.

2681
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Oh, it doesn't matter.

2682
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
It wasn't out.

2683
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I want to hear about New York Con.

2684
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:41,000
So you got to play the new Turtles thing and how was it?

2685
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:47,000
The new Turtles game, I'm not sure if they had it on out for own.

2686
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I didn't think so.

2687
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,000
They just kept advertising it.

2688
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
I do know it was pretty much from the people that did on Smash Brothers Brawl.

2689
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:56,000
So I think this is going to be a good title that they're working on.

2690
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Well, we'll see. I'm a little skeptical because some of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games are kind of ass, but we'll see.

2691
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Did anybody see Hawks?

2692
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,000
It was on display.

2693
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Yeah, I got to play Hawks.

2694
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
How was it?

2695
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,000
It's like a very polished Ace Combat.

2696
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Sweet.

2697
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
And yeah, it's a lot of fun.

2698
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
I like shooting things with jets.

2699
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Alright, so really quickly guys, then we're going to let you go because we've got to get some more calls because we're kind of running long tonight.

2700
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:24,000
But best thing you saw at Comic Con, Matt?

2701
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Aside from the Ghostbusters game, there's a new game called Prototype, which is coming out for the 360.

2702
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
It's awesome.

2703
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:45,000
It's everything what Spider-Man Web of Shadows should have been. It's really brutal and free roam New York City mutant thing. It's really great.

2704
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Alright, and Rama, best thing?

2705
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
It has to be a tie. Number one, the Ninja Turtles arcade machine.

2706
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:59,000
And number two, the attempt at breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for the biggest amount of video game cosplayers and one shutting.

2707
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Did you break it?

2708
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:07,000
No. The record was 342. There was 90 of us.

2709
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Street Fighter IV there?

2710
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Maybe next year.

2711
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
I suppose I think it was. I don't know.

2712
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Was it your favorite?

2713
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Wait, what?

2714
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
You saying Street Fighter IV was there and it wasn't your favorite?

2715
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Okay.

2716
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Well, I didn't see it there.

2717
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Ron Tron.

2718
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Yes?

2719
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
We need to do that at Fandame.

2720
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:32,000
No, because that title has got to come back to the US.

2721
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
We need to do this at Fandame.

2722
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Alright.

2723
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Before I go, if you see pictures of us at the video game shoot, you'll be seeing me in the back holding up a giant Super NES.

2724
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Nice.

2725
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:49,000
And actually two quick last things. I'm posting pictures in the chat regularly.

2726
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Awesome.

2727
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:57,000
And also one very last thing. Expect a care package of schwag coming in the mail.

2728
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Oh, you guys are the best.

2729
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I love the fans. We don't even have to go to these events and we get goodies. Love it.

2730
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Thank you guys so much.

2731
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Not a problem.

2732
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Have a good one, kids. See you later.

2733
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Speaking of our fans doing nice stuff for us, I would like to personally thank IkumaJP for the box of puka.

2734
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Which, by the way, I do still have some of the nom noms in the house if you guys want some of the nom noms.

2735
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Alright, we're going to go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2736
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Hi, this is Spazinator.

2737
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2738
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Two quick questions.

2739
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:40,000
With the Xbox 360, do you know if there's a hard driver available that's bigger than 120 gigs?

2740
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Not yet. It's just a matter of time, though.

2741
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Well, the reason I ask is because I hate to see it, but my hard drive is running out of space as it is.

2742
02:37:52,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Also, secondly, can you think of any retro games that you would like to see released for any one of those three systems?

2743
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I'm sorry, run that by me one more time?

2744
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:23,000
You know how retro games are kind of big and they're constantly getting released for all three systems, whether it be Wii, Virtual Console, the PlayStation 3, or XBLA.

2745
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Can you think of any game that you would like to see released for one of those three, or are you pretty much all set?

2746
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Mega Man 10.

2747
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,000
What, that will be released, or that was released?

2748
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:40,000
You would like to because he released.

2749
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Mega Man 10 at some point would be awesome.

2750
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:46,000
As long as they stay with the Mega Man 9 series and do a Mega Man 10, that'd be great.

2751
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Mega Man 9 was awesome for all three systems, but of course was the best on the Wii because it was just the most authentic retro, new retro experience.

2752
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I'm surprised that, I mean, I'm not surprised, but Bionic Commando Rearmed would be really nice on the Wii if they decided to do it.

2753
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:14,000
I don't think the game that needs to be remade, that was out before its time, and I mean, I know that I hate this game and I hate the fanboys for it.

2754
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Although I approve of fanboyism and go for it, love what you love.

2755
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:25,000
I really think that the game that needs a remake, needs it for anything powerful enough to run it, is Final Fantasy VII.

2756
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:33,000
So I'd like to see Final Fantasy VII remade for every console with state-of-the-art 3D graphics and the storyline re-translated so it makes sense,

2757
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:37,000
and more party options, and just kind of the fleshing out that it really needs.

2758
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:43,000
But you know if they make it they're just going to dumb it down, it's going to be simpler and easier than it even was before, which was too easy to do.

2759
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:46,000
But at least it'll have real nice CGI.

2760
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Yeah, I definitely agree with you. I'd love to see a remake of VII, you know, because I used to love that game.

2761
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Unfortunately I don't have my copy of it anymore, so if they ever do release the game again, I'll buy it.

2762
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:08,000
I'll buy anything but the DS, you know, because the DS will just basically be able to do it as it originally was.

2763
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Well, thank you for taking my call.

2764
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
You are welcome.

2765
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Alright, you have a good one.

2766
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Take care Spazinator, have a good one.

2767
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:23,000
I don't know whether Final Fantasy VII would fit on Xbox Live Arcade, that's the only problem I see going on with that, but who knows, we'll see.

2768
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Yeah, because you know if they wanted to make it, Microsoft wouldn't make an exception.

2769
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
We'll see. Alright, we got another call.

2770
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Hello, this is DSMaster25.

2771
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Hi, what's on your mind?

2772
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Not much. Urban got a PSP 2000, but it's kind of flukey on me, I buy it used.

2773
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Wait, I find this ironic, because your name is DSMaster, yet I'm looking at your logo on Skype and your call is about a PSP. Please explain.

2774
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Basically, I was desperate for one, because I wanted Skype and everything, so I figured why not buy a PSP, so basically I did.

2775
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
You wanted what game?

2776
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I wanted to use Skype, portably, but the Skype zones were not in America, so the only other option was a PSP.

2777
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Interesting, okay, okay.

2778
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:26,000
So basically, I bought one used, now I have this cracked on my screen, and now my start button, my select button, my home button, all that doesn't work.

2779
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:36,000
It sounds like you have a broken PSP. I would recommend replacing it with a new working one, preferably a 3000 series, because if you wanted to use Skype...

2780
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:40,000
He said he bought it used, I'm curious, did you buy it used at GameStop?

2781
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Yes.

2782
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Sad trombone.

2783
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Well, did you buy it like that, or did you buy it nice and you made it like that?

2784
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Because if you bought it like that, take that puppy back. Hopefully you were smart enough to buy the extended service on it.

2785
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Unfortunately, I was dead broke by the time I bought the PSP, so I didn't have any money to buy the extended service.

2786
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Sad trombone.

2787
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
What was wrong with the PSP now?

2788
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:17,000
This is just a sad trombone call.

2789
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Basically, the home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and sound...

2790
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Do they not test these things? Do they not notice him scratch on the screen, or a big crack on the screen?

2791
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Because I know when you have to go trade stuff in there, it's like, does this shit work?

2792
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Well, here's the deal. You're about to get an education as to the inside workings of used game stores.

2793
02:42:52,000 --> 02:43:03,000
They get ranked on how much they get traded in, so a lot of times they'll let crap slide, and then they get ranked on selling you stuff.

2794
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:06,000
So they're going to try to foist it on you.

2795
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Now, there are game stores like mine where if you bring me a system, man, I'm looking for a reason to say no, because I'm a jerk.

2796
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Honest. It's like, you bring me an Xbox, I've already got five Xboxes. If that thing ain't pristine, I'm like, take it home with you. I don't want it.

2797
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:28,000
But at the same time, it's like, if you bought a system from GameStop, and it's broken, you have a guarantee. Hopefully you didn't buy it that long ago.

2798
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Take that puppy back. Make him exchange it for a nice one.

2799
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:39,000
If you bought it months ago, and you've just been dealing with it being all broken, and you let it go, I mean, you better go to the manager and bank.

2800
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:45,000
And just, you know, don't be a jerk about it, because he'll dig in, but, you know, hopefully they can give you some satisfaction.

2801
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Don't try to be like, well, I want a new system or my money back. Just be like, look, I'm not looking for anything more than the same unit in nice shape.

2802
02:43:53,000 --> 02:44:01,000
You know, that works for what I need to do. You know, systems get tested, but it's, every store is run by different people.

2803
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:07,000
That's why there's bad, you know, GameStop as a corporation is reasonably evil, but that's just like any corporation.

2804
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:11,000
They're there to make money. There's good stores, and those stores deserve you to go shop there.

2805
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:17,000
And there's bad stores, and those stores deserve for you to sit outside in your running car, and when they come out at night, just run them over.

2806
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:22,000
And then maybe they'll get some good people in there, and you can have another good game store.

2807
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Orange House Radio does not actually endorse this thing.

2808
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
So what you're telling me-

2809
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Okay, they may not endorse it officially, but you know they're all down with it.

2810
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I'm down with it.

2811
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Hey, so what you're telling me is basically go back in there, because my 30 day guarantee has already passed, because I bought this on December 22nd.

2812
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Otherwise, you know, the buttons and stuff not working? I mean, which buttons are not working on there?

2813
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:57,000
The home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and the sound equizer.

2814
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:58,000
For what it's worth?

2815
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Stop, stop you guys. Okay, so basically all the buttons on that bottom row, right?

2816
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Yeah, except for start. That's the only one that works.

2817
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:16,000
It sounds like the ribbon cable's loose in there, so that would be easy enough just to take it apart, and you can actually plug that back in if you want to do that.

2818
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
And then replacing the screen's like 30 bucks, I think.

2819
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Well, that's if they stonewall you on just giving you some satisfaction.

2820
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:29,000
I believe GameStop has a one month guarantee on a used system. Get that puppy back ASAP.

2821
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Now, if you chopped a game crazy, we'd give you a 90 day guarantee without you even paying any extra money.

2822
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Nice, nice. Now here's the thing.

2823
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Plug, plug, plug.

2824
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
For what it's worth, your call sounds great.

2825
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And you'll be funny with the PSP system. I don't know if you could do one on them where you buy a used system and swap it for the broken one.

2826
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
You sold me a busted system.

2827
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:58,000
They're serial numbered, but I mean, you know, if you want to try a fast one that's on you, I can't tell you to do that or not tell you that.

2828
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:01,000
That's up to your quality of being a human being.

2829
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:06,000
But, hey, I won't say I've never done anything like that.

2830
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:11,000
I think I'm going to wait until I get money, and then I'm going to buy 3,000.

2831
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:16,000
You know, go back. And then I'll use this one for like emulators.

2832
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
That's a good idea.

2833
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:25,000
I think the advice too would just be, you know what, go in, anyone else that finds themselves in this situation, go in, be nice about it.

2834
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Don't be a dick because no manager is going to want to do favors for you if you're a dick.

2835
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Go in, be nice about it, and see if they'll do a favor for you.

2836
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
And if not, run them over with your car.

2837
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:38,000
But your other idea was great, especially if, like Loki says, there's a ribbon cable in there.

2838
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:45,000
If you like taking crap apart, and you're out of warranty and can't get any help, take that puppy apart.

2839
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
PSPs are awesome inside.

2840
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,000
There's all sorts of cool stuff you can do with them.

2841
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:55,000
You can blow up their batteries and lose pieces, change the color of the buttons.

2842
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Turn them into lasers?

2843
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:03,000
No, but seriously, there's a lot of stuff inside there.

2844
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:08,000
If someone took it apart to, I don't know, do something, you know, they may have accidentally fucked something up.

2845
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Because it's pretty easy to do that because I've done that before when I took something apart.

2846
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Oh, the ribbon cable's not all the way in, and you have to really shove that puppy back in there, and then it'll probably work.

2847
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Because it sounds like that might be the issue, because all of a sudden the buttons won't just die.

2848
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
It's the ribbon cable.

2849
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Yeah, one of the janky things about used PSPs, you've got to watch out.

2850
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:34,000
No, but basically what happened was I bought it, and all the bottom row buttons were working just fine.

2851
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:39,000
And then the Monday show after, I was listening to you guys in the shower, okay?

2852
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Oh, so now it's our fault.

2853
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
No, no, no, no.

2854
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Now, see, this is just getting weird in reverse.

2855
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Basically, I'm trying to change the volume, and I'm reaching through the shower curtain, and I think I might jump some water, but I don't know.

2856
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Well, see, okay, now wait a minute. Now this is all on you, buddy. You broke your PSP.

2857
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Okay, keep this one for use in the shower, and you're doing it, and keep it away from the water.

2858
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
What is the water?

2859
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:07,000
I'm just curious, is this an OA verse that you've been listening to in the shower?

2860
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
I'm just curious.

2861
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:17,000
If you do want to use it in the shower, they do sell waterproof cases you can put on the PSP.

2862
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:20,000
All right, DS Master, we've got to let you go to get some more help.

2863
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
I'm just saying, if that's your thing.

2864
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
Are you all soapy?

2865
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Good luck.

2866
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:34,000
DS Master, good luck to you, and next thing, if you do get a new PSP, keep it out of the bathtub.

2867
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:41,000
By the way, the only reason why I bought this one was because I was speculating about the scan lines on the 3000 model.

2868
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Now I figured it's not such an interesting issue.

2869
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
It's all the same, it just has a mic.

2870
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:51,000
All right, good luck, PSP, DS Master, whoever you are, and have a good one, okay?

2871
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
All right, bye.

2872
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I don't know if that guy's ever called in before. I might have been a first-time caller, so that was a good call.

2873
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I like the... Oh, good times. We'll try to do at least one more call here and then wrap up the show.

2874
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2875
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
It's Death Wishing. Hey, what's up?

2876
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Well, hi, Death Wishing. You're a first-time caller too, aren't you?

2877
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Yep.

2878
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
What's on your mind?

2879
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:25,000
I'm kind of disappointed with a lot of stuff I see in this year for gaming.

2880
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:30,000
In this year of gaming, in 2009 in gaming? How so? Just because it seems like there's nothing to look forward to?

2881
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I know it just started, but it's just... I don't know. This summer seems a lot more droughted.

2882
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,000
I can already tell this summer it's going to be a major drought for gaming.

2883
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Do you think it might be that everybody's trying to keep it in their pants until E3?

2884
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:45,000
That's kind of one thing I've been trying to tell myself as much as I might be lying to myself.

2885
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Maybe people are trying to keep it in their pants until E3.

2886
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
That would be different.

2887
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:55,000
You've got to remember, games and game developers are like plants.

2888
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:59,000
And their water is money. And there's no money out there right now.

2889
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:03,000
So things are quiet.

2890
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:07,000
You've got to actually think, this summer there's not going to be crap anyway.

2891
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:10,000
You've got to look towards the fourth quarter.

2892
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:14,000
They're not going to be making announcements about the fourth quarter until mid-spring,

2893
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:18,000
when they've gotten through the Street Fighter IV and the Resident Evils and the Killzone II.

2894
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:22,000
You've got some... I mean if you actually think about it, this is a great spring for games.

2895
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:28,000
There are some just nice AAA titles for every system.

2896
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Nintendo had a great Christmas, at least in the States with the Wii.

2897
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:35,000
I know they're having a lot of trouble in Japan.

2898
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:40,000
But really, I think that if you look at a lot of the release lists and whatnot,

2899
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:44,000
there's a lot of cool stuff coming out for everybody.

2900
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Skip the Summer, there'll be a big title or two, but it's not going to blow any wind up your skirt.

2901
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:54,000
And then just look to the fourth quarter, man.

2902
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
That's where all the big games are.

2903
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Dan does have a point, because our economy is in such shit right now in the US.

2904
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
I don't know if you're calling for the US or wherever.

2905
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:08,000
But the thing is, it seems like on this show, week after week after week,

2906
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:12,000
we've been reporting, this studio has closed, this studio has closed, this studio has closed.

2907
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:15,000
So damn, we're kind of lucky to be getting to get any games at all at this point.

2908
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:18,000
But I do kind of agree. I feel that same frustration.

2909
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:22,000
It seems like every game comes out at Christmas.

2910
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:26,000
It seems like the rest of the year, and we don't know what's coming out at Christmas yet,

2911
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:29,000
because they're going to wait and announce all that stuff at E3 probably.

2912
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:30,000
You're going to see all the Christmas titles.

2913
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:35,000
But right now, especially on Nintendo, it seems like there's nothing to look forward to on the Wii.

2914
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:39,000
There's a couple gems here and there on 360 and PS3.

2915
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Maybe your Street Fighter IV. There are some little things here and there, but not enough.

2916
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Gamers get spoiled. They expect big releases every month.

2917
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Maybe because Hollywood spoils us. There's a big movie every week.

2918
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Movie games still happen.

2919
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
So don't get me started on movie games.

2920
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:02,000
You're not in the first two years of any console's development cycle now.

2921
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:07,000
They've all proven what they have to prove, except for Sony.

2922
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Look at Sony's lineup. They've got three killers.

2923
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:16,000
They've got Killzone, which is two weeks a week away.

2924
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:21,000
They've got Uncharted 2, which if you have a PS3, Uncharted is fantastic,

2925
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
and it's really good, and you should have played it.

2926
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:26,000
And they've got God of War.

2927
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Microsoft is kind of like, oh, we've got ODST. We've got Halo, but it's not really Halo.

2928
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:36,000
And they've kind of let their big franchises slip away from them.

2929
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Nintendo, there was an article not far back.

2930
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Nintendo's got half a dozen really cool releases coming up for the Wii,

2931
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:45,000
but it's all your ma and pa mainstream stuff, except we've got Punch-Out on there.

2932
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Punch-Out for the Wii should be pretty cool.

2933
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
But not as cool as Street Fighter IV.

2934
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Dude, I don't know if Punch-Out is awesome.

2935
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:55,000
But it's not Street Fighter IV. Punch-Out and Street Fighter IV.

2936
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:58,000
The Wii and the PS3 and the 360, they're two different worlds.

2937
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:01,000
What does Mike Tyson have on a Hadoop, honestly?

2938
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Dude, have you played Mike Tyson's Punch-Out?

2939
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:08,000
If you threw Ryu in there against Mike Tyson, he's got a one uppercut knockdown.

2940
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:11,000
But there's Ryu and Ken, and one's Hadoop, and one's Hadoop.

2941
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:15,000
I'm not a Hadoopkin. It's going to take off a third of your life.

2942
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:19,000
Mike Tyson takes off all your life with one punch.

2943
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:24,000
And if you don't dodge all those punches, you can't even block him.

2944
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:27,000
He made Shang Rong look like a sissy.

2945
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:31,000
You know what we have now? We have Obama with the veto uppercut.

2946
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:36,000
I fought Akuma last night in HD Remix, and I got beat uncontrollably hard.

2947
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,000
But at least I could hit him. Mike Tyson and Punch-Out, your ass is grass.

2948
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Put in 0073735963 in the password. Fight Mike Tyson.

2949
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:49,000
If you beat him, then I'm going to give you your props.

2950
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Wait, let me ask this as well real quick.

2951
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,000
For what it's worth, are you a 360 owner?

2952
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Yes, I do own a 360.

2953
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Does it still work?

2954
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Okay, honestly, I'm on my second 360, and I had it from release.

2955
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Okay, me too. I'm on my second one after release too.

2956
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
But actually, what I just kind of want to ask, I don't know,

2957
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:14,000
but just kind of also something that can kind of tide you over,

2958
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:18,000
is that don't forget, you still have coming out every week,

2959
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:21,000
not just Xbox Live Arcade games, but community games.

2960
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:25,000
And I realize there's a lot of poop out there in the community games,

2961
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
but there's a lot of pretty awesome stuff too.

2962
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:30,000
And you know, when you consider that in the retail world,

2963
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
you know, we get poop as well, like Fusion Frenzy

2964
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
and that fucking Crosswords game that I played this week.

2965
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:35,000
It was god awful.

2966
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,000
You know, you get a lot of that stuff.

2967
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
There's some pretty cool stuff that comes out too.

2968
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:41,000
So if you're feeling like, damn, I need a fix of something new,

2969
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
check out the community games.

2970
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
You might not see anything that's going to blow you away,

2971
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
but you might see something that, you know,

2972
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:50,000
a neat concept for a game that keeps you entertained for a little while,

2973
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,000
which is, you know, what a game should do.

2974
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:54,000
And when you consider those community games are dirt cheap,

2975
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
eh, it's something.

2976
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
And look past the big franchises.

2977
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Bionic Commando, which is coming out in a couple months, a month or so.

2978
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Looks great.

2979
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Mad World, which we talked about a few minutes ago.

2980
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
It's mind blowing.

2981
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Halo Wars is actually pretty fun.

2982
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
You know, there's a lot of stuff coming up this year,

2983
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,000
but maybe it's not Devil May Cry 5.

2984
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Maybe it's not Halo 4.

2985
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Just, you know, let that stuff lay for a while.

2986
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:21,000
You know they're going to rehash it.

2987
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,000
They're going to spit it at us.

2988
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,000
There's going to be a marketing blitz.

2989
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:27,000
You know, there's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 and 6 and 8 and 10.

2990
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:30,000
But, you know, here's your chance to branch out.

2991
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Try some new games.

2992
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:35,000
You know, just because they're not beating you down with another AAA title

2993
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,000
doesn't mean there aren't super high quality games by great developers

2994
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:43,000
who still have jobs, knock on wood, and will be blowing you out of the water.

2995
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
And like I said, look to the fourth quarter,

2996
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:46,000
because there are big names announced.

2997
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
Especially if you don't have a Sony, you know,

2998
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:54,000
go for God of War is going to be, you know, blamed by the better.

2999
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Badass.

3000
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:56,000
All right.

3001
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Death Wishing, we've got to let you go to close out the show,

3002
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
but thanks a bunch and thanks for tuning in tonight.

3003
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:00,000
We appreciate it.

3004
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Love you.

3005
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
All right, see ya.

3006
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:04,000
I think so.

3007
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:05,000
I love you too.

3008
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:06,000
We love you too.

3009
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Okay.

3010
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:09,000
We have last minute stories.

3011
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Huh?

3012
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Yeah, we do have some last minute stories.

3013
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
I do want to make an outbound call real quick.

3014
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:14,000
This is an important one.

3015
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,000
We do want to do one more call.

3016
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
This is outbound, because this is important.

3017
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:18,000
We want to get this person on the show.

3018
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
And unfortunately, the way our Skype is set up,

3019
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
we have not been able to get like incoming.

3020
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
We just get bombarded with everybody, which we love.

3021
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
You know, we love the fact that so many people are trying to get through,

3022
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,000
but there is somebody we wanted to talk to that couldn't get through.

3023
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:30,000
And we want to talk to him now.

3024
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Deke, are you there?

3025
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Yeah, I'm here.

3026
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Can you guys hear me?

3027
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Yes, we can.

3028
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,000
How are you?

3029
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Oh, not bad.

3030
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Tired.

3031
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:38,000
It's 10 30 here.

3032
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:42,000
The reason why I'm letting you have cuts tonight and come to the front of the line.

3033
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
You get cuts tonight is because Deke,

3034
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:47,000
you've got the mastermind behind our new website that is out there

3035
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
that the folks have been looking at.

3036
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Have you been happy with the feedback?

3037
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
It looks like a lot of people like it tonight.

3038
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:53,000
So far, yeah.

3039
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I've only heard maybe one little thing wrong with it,

3040
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
and I'm pretty sure that's got to do with the database move

3041
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
from the old website forums to the new one.

3042
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
And so that should be pretty easy to take care of.

3043
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
I was honestly thinking in the back of my mind

3044
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
that the site would have to be reset.

3045
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Like I was like, okay, we'll just have to start over with the forums.

3046
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
You know, our news will probably have to start from square one.

3047
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
And I was like ready to accept that.

3048
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
And then when I looked at the new site today, I was like,

3049
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:15,000
holy crap, he got everything migrated from the old site.

3050
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
That was pretty impressive.

3051
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:18,000
So props to you.

3052
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Oh, no worries.

3053
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
You know, it's my job.

3054
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
This is what I do for a living, so I'm used to it.

3055
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Yeah, so we don't pay you, so I mean, I hope the day job does.

3056
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Send you cookies.

3057
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Yeah, we will send you a token of our appreciation, don't you worry.

3058
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:34,000
But what did you want to call in and talk to the listeners about tonight?

3059
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
That was pretty much it.

3060
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
I just wanted to get your guys' responses to the new website

3061
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
and just find out what you thought.

3062
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:43,000
If there's any changes you wanted, just, yeah, that's pretty much it.

3063
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
We'll talk to you offline about some of the little stuff.

3064
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:48,000
I think we're going to write some new things to maybe replace some of the dated things,

3065
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
even though you did copy them over from the old site.

3066
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:54,000
I think some things could use an 09 update, you know, like where the podcast is at and everything.

3067
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
But other than that, I mean, the site itself looks great.

3068
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:59,000
I love the idea of people sending in their own pictures.

3069
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
I hope people don't abuse that, so we have to lock it down.

3070
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Yeah, I'm going to keep track of that and make sure nobody kind of abuses it.

3071
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
I want to see cocks popping up all over the place.

3072
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:08,000
No cock shots.

3073
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:11,000
Dar Sakura on break took a picture of me eating jelly beans just randomly

3074
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
and uploaded them to the thing.

3075
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
So I don't know, what should I hold up?

3076
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Oh, how about cookies? Let's hold up cookies for this,

3077
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:20,000
and we'll send it right to the website right now.

3078
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:24,000
There you go. I just posted one of myself posing next to the website a couple of minutes ago.

3079
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Nice. Very nice.

3080
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:27,000
I like it.

3081
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Well, we're very excited about it, and we hope to have it launched maybe next weekend even or something, you know,

3082
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
just as soon as we get some of our new authors on board,

3083
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:38,000
because I know Tiara's getting ready to write some game reviews for us.

3084
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:41,000
I'm so excited, and we're going to have regular content again.

3085
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:44,000
I could just tinkle. I'm so excited.

3086
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Awesome.

3087
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Not in here.

3088
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:51,000
All right. Well, Deke, thank you so much, and please send our thanks along to your family as well,

3089
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,000
who I know have had to put up with you working on the site, and we really appreciate it.

3090
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
No worries. Take care, guys.

3091
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
All right. Take care, Deke.

3092
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Australians are cool.

3093
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
You know, what's funny is that he's actually living in Canada now, though.

3094
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Canadians are less cool, but okay.

3095
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:09,000
It's going to pass because you're there.

3096
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Well, he definitely still has the Australian accent, but I think it's a little bit of both.

3097
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Very cool. Very cool.

3098
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:19,000
A very international family one way or another, so we appreciate that.

3099
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:22,000
He's an Australian guy living in Canada, listening to an American show.

3100
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
The Internet is an amazing thing.

3101
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
All right. That's going to do it.

3102
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
We are going to wrap up the show.

3103
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Sorry to those that didn't get through on Skype.

3104
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:33,000
I know a lot of you were getting through, but I also was very happy to hear some new callers get through tonight.

3105
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
That was pretty awesome, so thanks and shout out.

3106
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Thanks to the guy who ate up all the time because his system was broken because he's using it in the shower.

3107
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Well done.

3108
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:45,000
I think the Justin TV things actually kind of helped us get some new listeners,

3109
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
so I'm really excited to get back on there.

3110
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:50,000
I don't know. I don't think watching a radio show is that exciting,

3111
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:53,000
but we'll see what we can do about the TV in the future.

3112
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Maybe we'll get a Switch box and actually play games.

3113
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
I don't know what we can do. We'll figure something out.

3114
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:03,000
I can fix it so the audio, you can hear everything next time.

3115
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:09,000
That's easy. Just splitter your speaker out and then into the...

3116
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
They don't want to hear about the wires.

3117
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
We'll make it happen one way or the other.

3118
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
You guys got to see it in here. It's a wiring idea.

3119
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:16,000
It's awesome.

3120
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,000
They're going to take a picture.

3121
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:18,000
When I move...

3122
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
So you can see what they go through so you can hear them.

3123
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:23,000
I can't live in this house forever because I'm a renter,

3124
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:26,000
and someday they're going to kick me out or I'm going to want to actually buy a house.

3125
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
When I move, it's going to suck.

3126
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Anyway, that's for another time.

3127
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3128
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
This is going to be a three-hour show this week, but that's all right.

3129
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
First off, I want to say Matt, too.

3130
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Thank you so much for being here.

3131
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
I'm sorry you didn't get to say more tonight,

3132
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
but we'll talk more about PC games in a future week.

3133
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:44,000
You will come back and join us again, correct?

3134
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:45,000
It's Dan's fault, yes.

3135
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:48,000
No, yes. I had a blast. Thanks for having me.

3136
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
PC gaming is more my niche, but yeah.

3137
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Tell us, and we will do more PC gaming in the future.

3138
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
There hasn't been a lot this week, and we actually get the emails.

3139
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Why don't you ask to talk more about PC gaming?

3140
03:00:57,000 --> 03:01:00,000
That's why I was like, Matt, too, probably sent one of those emails.

3141
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:04,000
It needs to come to the show a little more often.

3142
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
I do want to say, though, for the folks out there who listen,

3143
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:10,000
who can't join us in studio, how is it different when you're listening to it on the iPod

3144
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
and when you're here in studio?

3145
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,000
It's actually a great way to kill two to three hours of my afternoon at work,

3146
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
which is quite spectacular.

3147
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Quality is good, easy access.

3148
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:22,000
How's it different being here live?

3149
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Oh, being here live? It's colder in the garage because my office is a balmy 72 degrees.

3150
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:32,000
It's definitely different. There's definitely a lot of wires around.

3151
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
It's a lot of fun.

3152
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:40,000
At times I feel like I'm a little behind the times with all the wealth of knowledge that's in here.

3153
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
I feel like the noob.

3154
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:46,000
But when we started talking about WoW updates, I felt cool again.

3155
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Dan's pointing at me. He's about to say something profound.

3156
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:50,000
We'll work on you.

3157
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:53,000
He says in the world of WoW, you are the king.

3158
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Sadly, possibly, but no, there are people that out DPS in the tank.

3159
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,000
In here anyway.

3160
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
In here? Okay, cool. I'll take that title.

3161
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Sometimes I hear a term involved. I'm like, I know what that means.

3162
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:04,000
DPS, sweet.

3163
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
No, I had a blast. Thanks for having me.

3164
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:09,000
I look forward to next shows where you'll have room for me.

3165
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Of course. Anytime, anytime.

3166
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Dan, what can I say? Thank you so much for being here and bringing in your input.

3167
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
The chatters love you.

3168
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
They want you to be a regular guest on the show.

3169
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Please come back again, Dan. We had a lot of fun.

3170
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Even if, even if your wife is a little pissed, you keep taking her microphone.

3171
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Maybe we'll get two mics on the couch next time or something.

3172
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:26,000
Don't bet on it.

3173
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:30,000
All right.

3174
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:33,000
I am not pissed. It's just.

3175
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:36,000
No, she's fine.

3176
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,000
You are a butt face.

3177
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,000
That's great.

3178
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:44,000
He told her the mic was off.

3179
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts?

3180
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Oh, I didn't even ask for last minute stories.

3181
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:51,000
I'm such an asshole.

3182
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Last minute stories quickly.

3183
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Dark Sakura.

3184
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:58,000
There was a guy named Danny Johnson, 14 of grapevine, Texas.

3185
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Shut up.

3186
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Who actually set a new world record in guitar hero at a Guinness world records event in Manhattan.

3187
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:13,000
He scored 973,954 points playing dragon forces through the fire and the flames.

3188
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:19,000
And from what I read otherwise, um, he actually broke a button while doing it.

3189
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:22,000
He broke his blue button and, uh, he was mad at himself.

3190
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:23,000
He didn't hit a hundred percent.

3191
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
He only hit 99 percent.

3192
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:31,000
I'll link the video in the chat room.

3193
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Loki, did you have any last minute stories?

3194
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
Yeah, just some real quick stuff.

3195
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:39,000
Namco is planning on rebooting the dead to rights franchise in, um.

3196
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:42,000
Dear God, why?

3197
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:43,000
I don't know.

3198
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
Um, interesting, I guess.

3199
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:49,000
And then, um, some other stuff.

3200
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Apparently some dude, uh, threatened to blow up the Bomberman devs because he had a problem with his Bomberman game, I guess.

3201
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:01,000
He had sent them 11 terrorizing emails during a four month period.

3202
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:04,000
He was at the company and finally decided to do something.

3203
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:08,000
He was unhappy with the quality of Hudson products.

3204
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:09,000
He was just getting into the spirit of things.

3205
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:10,000
I know.

3206
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
We have one more contribution.

3207
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Mmm.

3208
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
Oh, jeez.

3209
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:21,000
And then, uh, Telltale Games is bringing Wallace and Gromit to a PC and Xbox Live Arcade this spring.

3210
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:22,000
I heard about that. It sounds awesome.

3211
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:30,000
And then the last thing, and this is completely retarded, but, PlayStation 3 apparently is going to start supporting Ambiex.

3212
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
What the hell is that?

3213
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:37,000
Ambiex is a stupid little thing that you plug into your, it's, it's right now for computers.

3214
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:43,000
It has, like, colored lights that change colors for, depending on the scenes that are in your, um, game.

3215
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Then there's also, uh, fans that blow hot and cold air at you and it vibrates and craps.

3216
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Think about it. That could be cool.

3217
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Yes, and craps.

3218
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:53,000
And craps.

3219
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:56,000
You can say, hey, this sucks shit.

3220
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
And it's all, pfft.

3221
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
Wow.

3222
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:03,000
That could be a feature in Excite Trucks 2.

3223
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Now the Trucks crap.

3224
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:13,000
I mean, why not? You can see those, you see those guys, like, that drive down the freeway and they have the balls hanging from their trucks?

3225
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:16,000
Why not? Now they can crap, too.

3226
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
Don't justify that behavior, Rob.

3227
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:21,000
I, well, I think that's the most vile thing possible.

3228
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:24,000
If you have that on the back of your truck, take it off your truck and choke yourself with it.

3229
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Um, seriously.

3230
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
Please die.

3231
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:35,000
Also, I have one quick last minute story, or I'm gonna get the crap kicked out of me by you.

3232
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:39,000
I'm gonna get the crap kicked out of me by Travis and John over at Undersedation Live.

3233
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:44,000
Um, the, I believe they're down to like, I wanna say like 32 games, or 16, how many are they at?

3234
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:47,000
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14.

3235
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:51,000
They're down to like the top 32, I think something, games right now.

3236
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
Um, in the March Madness.

3237
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
There's just a shitload of polls right now on our forums.

3238
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
Make sure you vote if you haven't.

3239
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:00,000
I believe tomorrow at midnight is when the next round closes and it's gonna go on to the next round.

3240
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
I'm sure somebody will post a link and chat there shortly.

3241
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:05,000
And I wanna also apologize, I missed Travis' bachelor party.

3242
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:08,000
I was out of town last night and didn't get John's message until very late.

3243
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:11,000
But we are sending Travis all our best here from Orange Launch Radio and Jenna.

3244
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,000
And, uh, hope for the best for them for the future.

3245
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
Hugs and kisses.

3246
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,000
So.

3247
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Finally?

3248
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,000
Yes, yes.

3249
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Oh my god, this is fantastic!

3250
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
Yes, where have you been? Alright, yes.

3251
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:26,000
Marriage is great, isn't it Dan?

3252
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:30,000
It's more than I could have ever imagined.

3253
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:33,000
And I mean that.

3254
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:39,000
Yeah, I guess they're doing the totally cliche Valentine's Day thing, you know, with this weekend coming up.

3255
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:45,000
We got engaged in theory on Valentine's Day.

3256
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
Do you know what I did on Valentine's Day?

3257
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:50,000
Sat home and cried and ate lean cuisine.

3258
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:51,000
That's what I did.

3259
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
No, I'm kidding.

3260
03:06:53,000 --> 03:07:01,000
But ours was really cool and nerdy because we were watching UHF and eating French bread with spinach dip and drinking munch fries at Swine.

3261
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:07,000
I will say one of the coolest Valentine's Days I had was when the ex and I went to the Star Trek experience.

3262
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:11,000
Or not the Star Trek experience, but the tour. We went to the Star Trek tour at Long Beach.

3263
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:15,000
That was a pretty nerdy test at Valentine's Day, so, you know.

3264
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:19,000
Some people get married, some people boldly go where no man has gone before. What can you do?

3265
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:22,000
Which kind of are the same thing.

3266
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Alright, congrats to Travis, sucker.

3267
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:31,000
No, actually, Jenna's the real sucker, actually, in that relationship.

3268
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:35,000
No, we love him. Sorry I missed the bachelor party. I was out.

3269
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:44,000
But yeah, thanks to all you guys for tuning in and listening to us, whether it be on Justin TV or on All Games Radio or on the podcast when it gets updated, which will be sooner than usual.

3270
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:49,000
And that's it. We'll see you next week. We're gonna do it all again next week, right?

3271
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Well, now everyone knows what my home life is like.

3272
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Heck yeah. Alright. Quickly, final thoughts. I didn't get final thoughts. Dark Soccer, your final thought.

3273
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
You know what you're doing.

3274
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:03,000
My final thought is Warpcore Breach, yum. Loki.

3275
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:06,000
I need a Cage Man song.

3276
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
Alright, that's gonna do it. Thank you guys so much for downloading-

3277
