00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and LocoCade

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Tonight, February 15th, 2009

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
A landmark Sony store says goodbye

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Mario and Sonic get ported to the Winter Olympics

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And is Namco Bandai about to acquire D3?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
And joining me every week here in the OLR Studios

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
In Sacramento, California

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Who's feeling a little bit under the weather apparently

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yep

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Actually, we're all under the weather

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
It's one thing, one kind of common theme

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
I've been pretty sick

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm above the weather

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
I had, you're above

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm over it all

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm above the weather

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
No one is above the law

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
The weather is not the law

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
The weather is chaos

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I've been kind of sick the past few days

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I had a horrible Valentine's Day because of it

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
And Loki's a little bit sick as well

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Say hello, Techmaster Loki

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Loki's always a little sick

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm a little sick and a little eating sandwich

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
That's right

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
And then some of the folks on Justin TV are already commenting how messy the studio looks tonight

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, well that's what happens when you're sick

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
You don't really feel like cleaning

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Plus, we're presented in widescreen tonight

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
So you can see even more of the mess that is usually off screen

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I was wondering why his lightbox is in there

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
What's that?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I really didn't notice

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
All the crap that's around?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
It's not that bad

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
This room has been way, way worse

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
It's usually not live during a show

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
So

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Anyhow

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Also joining us tonight, you know why he had so much freaking fun last week

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
He decided to come back one more time for you kids

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Say hello to the one and only Dan the man

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Hello

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
How are you doing, Dan?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Back for more

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Did you miss us that much?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Yes

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I have no place else I'd rather be

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
You're lying

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Your internet's out at home, isn't it?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
True that

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Dan's internet's out at home

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So, you know, he's here

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Probably back on by now

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's right

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
But you're here

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Nice talking to you

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
With us

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, there's storms going on out in California right now

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Which is, you know, for most of the rest of the world

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
The storms here are actually pretty pitiful

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
You know, compared to the rain they get like back east and stuff

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
But it's just not built out here to withstand some of the wind things we get

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
So when we get it a little windy, internet goes down left and right

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
It's pretty sad

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
People forget how to drive and start ramming their car into things that we need

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Which I don't understand anyways how, you know, wind causes the internet to go down

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Since the cables are underground

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Sometimes, I don't know, like ours

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Underground wind

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Ours runs from the top

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
There's a big wire that comes down and it's weird

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It runs like next to the phone line

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Cable modems, son

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
When they're underground, yet they still go up

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Oh, whatever

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Anyhow, we're going to get started tonight talking a little bit about our gaming weeks

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
And since I finally remembered the presence I got Dark Sakura like a month ago in Hawaii

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I finally am going to remember to give her tonight

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
So I'm going to go in the house and get those while Dark Sakura tells us about her gaming week, Dark Sakura

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
I had a relatively busy gaming week despite school stuff

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
We played, I started playing City of Heroes this morning just on the trial

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Started playing with Sauce

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And it was pretty fun

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
You know, I picked an electric power user who was a pretty cool character

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
And of course the most fun part is actually designing your character, making costumes and stuff

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So that was pretty cool

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
I also finished, well I

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
I'm trying to think, what all did we play last night on the Genesis Collection?

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Last night being Valentine's Day evening

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
My husband and I decided to do something super romantic

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
And we played Xbox all night after I got us a lovely dinner prepared at Whole Foods

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
So we played a lot of Genesis Collection and some R-type dimensions

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
And I played some Symphony of the Night

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
And played a little, a couple of DS games but I don't remember what

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
Oh yeah, I downloaded and installed Perfect World but I haven't started that yet

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
So I'm thinking City of Heroes is going to be the game of choice

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I've heard some interesting things about City of Heroes

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I think one of us OLR peeps needs to get on that

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
That would be me

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Go for it

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Is it in Tiara on City of Heroes? Or was that a while ago?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
We were playing together

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh okay, cool

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, we played together today

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Because I know the new website is launching very very soon

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And we're going to have Tiara hopefully doing some articles for us there

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
That'd be good, that'd be good

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Not that I can think of

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Then how about presents?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I like presents

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Alright, some presents

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm going to show this to JustinTV before I give it to Jamie here

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
So I got Jamie an authentic hula girl for her dashboard

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
To match the one that Loki had

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So that's from Hawaii

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Even though these presents are like a month old I'm just now remembering to give them to her

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And because I know Jamie's a tea drinker

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I got her different types of tea that are very Hawaii

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
One of them is a coconut macadamia herbal

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Ooh, yum

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And the other one is pineapple Waikiki

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Dude, that's great, I love pineapple

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
So there you go, some tropical teas there for a dark soccer

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I could totally use it because my voice is dying

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
I know, I'm almost kind of wishing I brought some more home for me

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
But that's okay, I have other stuff

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Loki, you already got your presents a few weeks ago

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So he doesn't feel left out

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
But he got a matching hula girl

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Anyway, tell us about your gaming week, Loki

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
You picked the perfect time when I have my mouth full of food

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Sorry, I have to go take these presents over to dark soccer

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Anyways, so I played lots of Grand Theft Auto IV

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
And since it's actually working on the PC

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
I've been playing around with modding the different files and seeing what that does

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
So I've been playing with making different weapons

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
And I have the typical stuff, a weapon that has way too much physical power

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
So you shoot it into somebody and they bounce around like a ping pong ball

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
Or the grenades that create an explosion that's so big that it covers a four block radius with fire

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And kind of blows everything apart

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
And that's fun

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So I've been doing that

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
And the game of course is very unstable when you do that, so it's been crashing a lot

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
And then just playing regular Grand Theft Auto IV on consoles

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Doing the deathmatch stuff there

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Actually thinking of picking up Lost and Damned this week

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Actually I'm in a couple of them so I can try the multiplayer in that

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
And if that's really good then I may pick it up on all five consoles

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
And then that way we can play multiplayer in Lost and Damned

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
Then other stuff I've been playing, I played the Killzone 2 demo which is actually pretty good

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
Very similar to Resistance as far as I'm concerned

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
The game itself, not so much, not as hard as Gears of War of course

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
Although the game itself, the AI is very intelligent it seems

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
So I can't just easily kill them or just run up on them and stuff like that

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
But it looks cool and I think it'll be very entertaining

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
I'm not sure if I'm actually going to pick it up right away because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But maybe soon after

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Then the other game I played was Street Fighter IV

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And I've been playing that quite a bit

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
The game is actually quite easy to beat, obviously un-easiest

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Because I'm no good at the game at all

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
So it was easy enough to beat on it, not as easy as some videos would make it seem

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You can't just go high-kicking everything around

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Because the AI is smart enough to know, hey I'm going to kick your ass now

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Because you're just doing the same move over and over and over again

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Some people it works like the women with the long legs of course

08:19.000 --> 08:25.000
It works pretty well but it's not just like you can put on auto-fire and leave the room

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
They will kick your ass

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
But the stories are kind of neat in there, like the little anime cutscenes that they have

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
I don't know, it's not really a game I'm into

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Just because it's a fighting game

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Actually Tatsunoko vs Capcom was kind of entertaining for me

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I like the little theme song though that's in there, it's kind of cheesy

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And the voice acting, I like what's kind of cool about that is

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
After you beat the game the first time through you get an option to toggle the Japanese or English voices per character

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Hallelujah

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
So if you like some of the English dubbing then you can go ahead and leave it English

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Or you can just switch it to Japanese per character

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
So that's pretty awesome

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
That also has cutscenes and all the other stuff too

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
So I thought that was really cool

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And then other than that, it's just kind of fun

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
I was playing with some of the new characters, Rufus is kind of funny

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And then El Fuerto is pretty cool

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Repeat what your wife said about Rufus because that made me laugh

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Yes I was playing as Rufus and then Nellie's like

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
That looks like me but with blonde hair

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm like come on, that is ridiculous

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And Rufus is the big guy right?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah he's the one that has his belly flap physics

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Nellie is one of the tiniest people I've ever met

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Her beard also totally isn't that impressive

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
She was talking about herself

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
No Rufus is like me if I were to be in a fighting game pretty much

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
What I want to see now, I want to see Rufus versus

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Ok I'm going to go way back here everybody, ready?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Raiden from Fatal Fury, that's what I want to see

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I want to see that fight

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Just got to wait for the next round of crossover

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Or Chang from Fatal Fury 2

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
From Art of Fighting

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Oh and Seth is a bitch

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
Seth the final boss who has moves from all the other Street Fighter characters

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
He sucks, even on Easy as he's fucking cheap

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Let's get some comments from our chat room

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
chat.orangelandrated.com

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Chat is pointing out you sound different tonight

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
VSTRNSV says Loki sounds weird

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Tigerclaw says you sound slightly deeper

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
It's because I'm congested

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
He's been sick too, like all of us

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Literally every host in the L.R. is sick tonight

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
It's my sexy voice

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
That's ok, I feel ok

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Just in time for Valentine's Day

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Loki wants you to get down this week

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
With Street Fighter IV

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I'm gonna stab women on the

10:49.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm waiting by their phones for your call

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Some comments from chat

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
Leo Shen wants to know how's Crimson Viper

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Pretty good, I like her a lot better than like say

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
You know, Chung Li

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Some of her moves are interesting

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
You know this is, you're asking the person's opinion

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Who doesn't play this game, I mean hardly ever

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I played through her once

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
How did the tits compare to Ivy?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
That's what guys really want to know

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
You know, ok, here's the weirdest thing

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
Which fighting game has the best tits?

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Dead or Alive, Soul Calibur, or Street Fighter IV?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Dead or Alive, by far

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Soul Calibur

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And then we'll go to, you know, Street Fighter

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Because Street Fighter, they don't really seem to have any boot physics

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Although, I swear to god, I saw this during like

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
A little in-game cutscene

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Because there's a point where you have to fight your rival

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
That's the second to last character you fight before Seth

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
And, I swear to god, she was walking away and she turned

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
And her boobs snapped

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Like, it was like, they got stuck in some place and all of a sudden it's like

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Wham! And like went back

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
It just like threw me off

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Because she isn't, they don't like move when you're actually fighting

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
You know, it's not, the only person that has any sort of physics like that

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Or, that's Rufus, you know, with his big flap

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
But, um, so Rufus has booby physics

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Rufus has booby physics

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
It's, no, it's like gut physics

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I don't know

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Okay

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
But, um, yeah, it's okay

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I mean, like I said, I'm no good at Street Fighter

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
And, you know, I don't pretend to be, you know, winning any arcade game

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I mean, hell, I lose to the computer on easiest sometimes

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
So, that's pretty bad

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
You just need to do what I do at Chun Li and just hit the kick button repeatedly

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
It doesn't work

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Even on easiest that the like computer would be just like

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Okay, you stop doing stuff, I'm gonna walk over and punch you now

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
No, they're actually, it's pretty hard

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I don't know if it ramps up based on how well you're doing

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
But, you know, easiest isn't the cakewalk that I thought it should be

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Every time I hear the word Rufus, the first thing on my mind is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
I was thinking Rufus Shinra, but I was, I watched that pretty recently

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Alright

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Um, okay, so if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Then I'll talk about mine

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Mine was pretty much the same as Jamie's

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I played a lot of the new Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Except I played it for the Playstation 3

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Um, they didn't have it on 360 when I went

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
And I actually was thinking, you know what

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
For the classic games, I think I'll want the D-pad on the Playstation 3 controller

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
And why not, I don't have a lot of games that offer trophies

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
So if I feel like being an achievement whore on the PS3, why not, it makes sense

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
So I picked it up

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
And I'm pretty sure I'm getting the exact same freaking thing on the Playstation 3

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
That 360 users are getting, it's really not a big difference at all

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Um, but overall the game collection is pretty awesome

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I mean, you cannot beat the value

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
It's $40 for, what, no sorry

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
40 games for $30 and then like 9 unlockables in there

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
And some of the unlockables are pretty awesome

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
You get some arcade games like Altered Beast, Fantasy Zone, Shinobi

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
Which was awesome, and Dan had pointed out a fact I didn't think of before the show

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
But they have never released an official port of Shinobi Arcade for the home systems

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
I mean, you had the dumbed down

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
There have been lots of Shinobi ports, but you never see them on these collections

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
And not the authentic arcade version, like a lot of them were dumbed down for the 8-bit systems

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Like they had Shinobi on the NES from Tengen if I remember right

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
But it was pretty dumbed down, you know

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
It was different, at least they did

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
They tried to at least emulate the actual arcade version unlike

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Do you remember like Ninja Gaiden on the NES was completely different from Ninja Gaiden Arcade

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
But for the better in that case

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Way better

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Way better

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Anyhow, random tangent

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
But I just remember being a kid like it was Shinobi over here and Ninja Gaiden over here

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Like the two big Ninja games he had

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
So, anyhow

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
The collection is great, it's definitely worth the money

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
A slight disappointment that they didn't do more with the online functionality

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Especially when they've had us buy this collection before on the GameCube

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
And these collection, you know, or I shouldn't say the same collection

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
But you know, Sonic games at least all bundled together and so on

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
Little disappointed that they didn't do at least leaderboards, online multiplayer

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Something that brought in the extra functionality

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Who knows, downloadable games

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Why not, I mean we all noticed Revenge of Shinobi was missing from the collection

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
And some other big Genesis titles from back in the day are missing completely

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So why not have these as like download content

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
That would be actually kind of rad

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I, but I somehow doubt that's how they're going to do it

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Why should they?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
They released Sonic 1 and they released

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Didn't the original Streets of Rage come out for download 360

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
And one of the Sonic 2 was download content for Xbox Live Arcade

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Streets of Rage 2 dead

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Yeah, Streets of Rage 2, not 1

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Way better

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Yeah, so

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah, but wouldn't it be cool if they perfected their Genesis emulator with this game

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
And then it's like virtual console but with all Genesis games on the 360

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
That's really interesting about this that you say virtual console

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Because like seriously, if you own a Wii and a 360

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Or a Wii and a PS3

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Like this game invalidates the need for like almost all those Genesis games on virtual console

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
That you would have paid what 8 dollars times 40 is what 320 dollars for

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Again for a tenth of that, not even

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
It's just amazing

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
So I don't know

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I mean some could claim it's not 100% authentic

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
But at the same time I think it's really as close as you're going to get

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Short of bringing out the old Genesis system

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
And blowing off the dust and hooking it up and plugging it in

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
You know what I mean

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't see it ever getting any closer

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
So there it is

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
That's the reason to have a CDX though

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
For more games?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Because there's no CD games in this

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
No Sewer Shark

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It's just small and easy

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Or Nomad, you know

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Gotcha

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Maybe that's the next Sonic's Ultimate CDX collection

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And we'll have freaking Night Trap

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
You really want to play the Dana Plato game?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I don't know why I want to play the Dana Plato game but I do

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
There's microcosm in Sewer Shark

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Microcosm I actually liked

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
There was Dragon's Lair

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Where's my Jaguar collection?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Where it should be non-existent

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
It would just be Tempest 2000

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It would just be Tempest 2000

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
That's pretty much it

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I think there's one other good Jaguar game I can't think of right now

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Defender?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Going to comments from chat

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Acidic Vampire says they need some tougher achievements in that collection

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Yeah the achievements are a little easy

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
But again that's why online leaderboard at least would have been cooler

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
So you have something else to obtain

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah the achievements are a little easy

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
They're a little on the easy side

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Some of them will take you a little bit of determination to get

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah it was on the easy side

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Same thing with the trophies

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
The trophies and achievements are the same thing

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It's just that on the Playstation instead of worth points

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
They're worth either bronze, silver, or gold depending on what it is

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
But I unlocked a gold trophy easy

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I got the Sonic Spinball

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
No maybe it's just because I love Sonic Spinball

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
For whatever reason don't laugh

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
But I got 10 million points on stage one that's all you have to do

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
And that's like beating stage one pretty much

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
This is probably unlikely but can you combine games together

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Like you know with Sonic Spinball and all the Sonic games

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You can do the Sonic and Knuckles stuff

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Sadly no

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And actually you couldn't do that with Sonic Spinball I don't believe

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah you can

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
You could play as Knuckles

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
No you couldn't

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
You could do Blue Sphere

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah there was something I think like one little extra thing it gave you

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
No you could play as Knuckles in Spinball

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
What?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
I don't think you can

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I thought you could

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
You think you thought wrong

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
My Genesis collection which I mean is not a CD for my Xbox

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
But it's a box full of Genesis crap

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
It's sitting by my TV

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
If you want to come on by we'll walk on

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
But you get something with it

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
You get something you get the blue

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Just like all the other games it does the Blue Sphere game

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Not even the complete one I think it's only with Sonic the Hedgehog

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Yeah it's kind of dumb

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
But interesting

18:37.000 --> 18:41.000
Let's see I'm still looking at comments in the chatroom

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
GameGuru says it was Sonic 2 that gave you Knuckles

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Some of them gave you the extra character

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Alright I guess that's it for gaming week

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
Unless Dan I don't know if you played some stuff that Jamie didn't

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That you want to share with us but Dan do you have anything?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I've played nothing new this week

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Nothing new

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm still playing HD Remix

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I played R-Type Dimensions

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
And I played Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
For Shinobi mostly

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
There you go

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
And here's what I have to say

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Online leaderboards suck

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I don't know why you like them

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
All they do is serve to remind me

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
That the games that I think that I'm good at

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I really really suck at

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
But it gives you something to work towards

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
All I know is go to the online leaderboards for R-Type Dimensions

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
And see the people who have beaten that game without dying

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
Every one of those people I want to kick in the balls

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I thought I was good at R-Type I am no good at R-Type

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
I hate you all

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
There was some game it was the Midway Collection I think

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
One of the first that came out and it had online leaderboards

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
And like for a while I was in the top 10 for Wizard of War

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
That old ass 80's game and that made me feel pretty cool

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
Even though like nobody probably fucking played Wizard of War

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I dominated Roadblasters on that

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And the Xbox for months

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
See they can be fun

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
But you know what eventually somebody owned me

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
And that person when I find you

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I wish I remembered your gamer name

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
I will kill you

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Rob you did though play Streets of Rage right?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
You did listen to the pretty cool soundtrack

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Yuzo Koshiro absolutely

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
That was like my whole incentive for playing Streets of Rage

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Because I don't know I'm kind of sick of those side scrolling

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
I had forgotten that you did it

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Oh yeah you can tell too

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
It's very

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
It's all about playing Blaze in that game though because you guys suck

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Nice

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Nice

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
Alright let's get into some housekeeping real quick

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
There's a couple things on the table right now tonight

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
If you are listening to us live on AllGames.com or on Justin TV

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Hello by the way again to the Justin TV listeners

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
You can look at us on camera at Justin TV

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I don't know why you'll want to watch a radio show

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
But that's what the listeners ask for so we gave it to them

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Keep in mind we still don't have our issue fixed

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Where you can hear all the sound that goes out over air

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
So you only hear what goes through the microphones

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
You don't hear any of the music

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I forgot to bring the adapter for that

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's not a huge deal

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
I would hope that everybody is still at AllGames.com to get the full experience

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
But I know there's some people that because of firewalls and stuff

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
They can't so they have Justin TV

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Which seems very odd to me that you would be able to watch Justin TV

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
But not all, whatever

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Some people have claimed that happens so it's interesting

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
But that's interesting

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
The only other thing I want to say is that by the way

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Speaking of Justin TV stay tuned tonight on Justin TV

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Because we have something special after the show for you live folks

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
And if you're listening live tonight

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
OrangeLaunchRadio.com is down

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
It's not there

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
It's a big black screen with a Moblin that says it's a secret to everyone

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Something is in the works

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
And if you've been listening to the show for the past couple of weeks

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
You know darn well what's coming

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
That's going to happen live tonight during the show a little later on

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
They're just crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's right now

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
While we're taping

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
So in the meantime you can still join us at chat

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
There is still a link on OrangeLaunchRadio.com to go to our chat room

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
That is not being affected by the side outage

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Just check out OrangeLaunchRadio.com

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Some folks in chat sharing their online leaderboard experiences

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
ActDeaf says I was at one point in the top 20 users in championship mode of Pac-Man CE

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
That's a tough one

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
That is an achievement

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
That is an achievement

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Achievement unlocked

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
That is, you have a big EP for that one

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Because that is not an easy game to be doing that with

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
So, alright

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
And all that

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
And talk about what's new in the gaming world this week

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Are you done with your sandwich, Lowkey?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
No, I'm not done with my sandwich, but that's okay

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Alright, we'll make it work anyway

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
The show must go on

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
The show must go on

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
With or without sandwich

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Oh, let me say this real quick

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I am going to give a quick shout out to our buddy Brad from Pod Culture

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
He started a new podcast for that show Dollhouse

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I meant to watch that

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
I did watch it

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
I did watch it

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Because Joss is the man

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
Hopefully he has more listeners than there were viewers for the Dollhouse

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, did it not do well on the ratings?

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
No, it lost to Supernanny and I will have to say

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I was part of the Supernanny crowd, unfortunately

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
You know what, the whole...

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Rude

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
They just can't screw this up the way they did Firefly

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
Hopefully it will make up some listeners on like

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Or, you know, with, not listeners

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Viewers from like TiVo and iTunes and all that stuff right now

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
It's just on a bad night

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
I mean, most people don't stay home and watch TV on Fridays

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
The whole problem is that they screwed up Firefly so bad

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
That people are going to have a bad impression

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Those who never went back to watch the DVDs

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
I mean, Joss is the man

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I mean, I'm serious

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
If you put this show on any other day in the week

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
I think you'll be fine

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Seriously

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
Fox does have this tendency to give Joss Whedon the death spot

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
I mean, Friday nights

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
I mean, not to knock Fringe because I love Fringe

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
But if you want this show

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
If it's kind of tanking for you guys

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Why don't you just throw, you know, Dollhouse right after American Idol

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
I mean, then that way you get a really big lead in

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Hopefully they will one night

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
They'll give it a shot after American Idol

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I don't know, because the show is pretty decent

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Look, let me put it this way

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I know I'm like the gay guy you hear on the podcast or whatever

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
But seriously, like, if I was straight

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Elijah Dushku

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
You betcha

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
You betcha

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
She is pretty hot

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
She's very hot

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Yeah, that's happening for real

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
So anyway, I didn't give the website

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Support our buddy Brad's podcast

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
It's thedollhousepodcast.com

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
If you're a Whedon fan

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
You should check that out and support that show

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
But Joss is owned

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Buffy just doesn't strike twice

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
He hit too big too soon

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
It's all downhill from there

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Well, you know

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Firefly was awesome

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Ten times better than Buffy

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And it got screwed off of TV

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
So I don't see what the fans are hoping for

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Brad's actually saying in chat

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
We started a Deadpool on pod culture

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
About how long it'll take Fox to axe it

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
That's pretty morbid, but sad, but true

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
I know there had been talk about them actually

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
Doing a Faith spinoff

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
But this was a different idea

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
And I think that it was that he and Elijah Dushku

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Came up with the idea together, so

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Honestly, the show's not bad

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
It was a little hard to get into

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Because I think the first episode kind of hits the ground running

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
But it's not bad by any means

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Mark, put it on sci-fi

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I mean, shit

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
They just got, you know, what?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Reruns of, you know

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Some Stargate spinoff

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I mean, seriously, just put it on there

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah, but Stargate Atlantis was crap

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Alright, look, we gotta get into gaming news

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
We suddenly have turned into the nerdy podcast

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Sorry

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
We don't want to infringe on pod culture's territory

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Rock turned into?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Excuse me, what?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Turned into?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
You know what I mean, alright

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I watch a lot of TV during the week, okay?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
That's true

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Ever since I stopped playing WoW

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I have watched a shitload more TV than I used to

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I would never have watched All House

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Before it used to be, okay

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
House and NipTuck or whatever

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Now it's like

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Like, eight shows I'm watching

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
It's like, too much

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
But anyways

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Amazing Grace starts tonight

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
One show, one show

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
TiVo it, don't

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Supernatural

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I watched Wife Swap last week

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
That's how pathetic I was

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Not Supernanny, but what?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I actually watched Wife Swap then Dollhouse

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
We don't, like, watch Supernanny religiously

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It's just, if it's on, it's like

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Okay, so

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Rob, got more news for us

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Loki wants to start us off with a story tonight

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Alright, well

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
You know, after all the assumptions that

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
The viral video wasn't necessarily a viral video

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
And it was, you know

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Or it was a viral video, but just not leaked out

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Um, yeah

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Apparently that video that was out last week

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
You know, showing zombies

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
In, like, a Las Vegas type of

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You know, setting with

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
You know, a giant atmosphere and stuff like that

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Yes, that was actually

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Dead Rising 2

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And Capcom did announce Dead Rising 2

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Which will be coming out on PC, 360, and PS3

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It will take place

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
In a brand new

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
City

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Fortune City

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
It's kind of like Las Vegas

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
And it will be a gambling paradise

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
No longer will you be playing Frank West

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
But some guy in a jacket

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And there's, um

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Boo to that, I'm sorry, Frank West is awesome

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Okay

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
But they've got, you know, different pictures

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
You know, they have everything from

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Him beating up zombies with a giant cell phone

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
To a dirt bike

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
To a roulette wheel, so, um

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
But has he covered wars?

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Maybe

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
But see, here's the thing, though, maybe

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
We're only talking, like, four screenshots

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And everyone's assuming that Frank West is not there

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Maybe Frank West is there

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
But maybe there's two player co-op

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Maybe it's multiple characters

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Maybe he's a zombie

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
And he's like the super zombie

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
And you have to run over him with a riding lawn mower

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I don't know

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
But, hey, you know, it looks pretty awesome so far

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
So, um, I'm sure we'll hear more about this

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
During E3

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I need to go back and play more Dead Rising

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Because I had the first one, and that game is just fun

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
To just fuck around with

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Well, you can not do a lot of anything

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Play the sub-par Dead Rising chop till you drive

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
No, I can't, because I just will not be able to put up with that

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
After playing the 360 version

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
But they have new costumes

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
The entire fun of the 360 version

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Is taking pictures while you're doing these horrible

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Things to the zombies

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
They took that out of the Wii version, I'm sorry

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
But I would watch that for two player co-op

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Same screen or something, I don't know

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Talking about TV shows

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
In the chat room

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And video game potential

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Acidic Vampire suggests Supernanny the game

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
I don't know, I get the sense that would just be Imagine Babies

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Or something like that

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
What the hell is Supernanny?

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It's this show where

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
They call the 800 number

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
The producers of the show

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
If their kids are just out of control

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
You should watch this show because it would piss you off

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Are they Poppins modern day?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Yes, actually the lady

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Her name is Joanne or something, she's from Britain

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
So she has the accent and everything

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
She even carries a little umbrella

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And she comes and she restores harmony

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
To the household

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You know how to restore harmony to a household with unruly children?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
What?

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Duct tape, ceiling

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Basically this last episode that I missed Dollhouse for

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
It had this guy

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
This abusive dad who's like

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Slapping his kids and stuff

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
You can't slap the baby

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
That's not the way to raise your baby

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And it's like an hour of that

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You cannot slap your baby

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
I'm so glad

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I don't watch that show because it sounds retarded

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
It's just frustrating

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
And you know the thing that pisses me off the most, Rob

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Is watching people be stupid

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
That's why I like

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
I think your own personal hell would be shows

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Like you'd be strapped to a chair

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Forced to watch this and Wife Swap

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
And I don't know, some of these

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Feel good reality shows

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Feel good my ass, watching people be stupid

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Is the worst form of torture ever

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Do you know what I like to do?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I like to watch The Biggest Loser while eating

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Oh my god, now that would be crazy

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
This food is so tasty and you can't have any

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
It's all mine

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
It's my chocolate

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I ate an entire cup of

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Low fat ice cream

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Just for a medical thing I do low fat

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
An entire cup of low fat ice cream

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Which I know makes a lot of sense

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
It's not really low fat when you eat the whole fucking cup

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
You're holding it out and going

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Oh don't you want some?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
It's full of sugar

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Sugary goodness

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
It is, anyway

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm sorry, we need to get back to gaming news

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Can we please?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
One place I will not be eating ice cream ever again at

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Is the Metreon

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And we know the Metreon here at Orange Launch Radio

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
We actually have a lot of very fond memories of the Metreon

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I have no memories of the Metreon

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Other than it used to exist because I've never been to the Metreon

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Hold on, let me say it

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
The Metreon is not closing

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
But the Metreon has gone through a lot of changes in the past few years

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
For one, it's not owned by Sony anymore

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
And the reason why I say the Metreon holds a special place in our hearts

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
The very first Dance Dance Revolution tournament

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
If you've been listening to this show for any length of time

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
You know Dark Soccer, Loki, and myself

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
We all met playing DDR at the arcade

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
The first Dance Dance Revolution tournament I ever went to was at the Metreon

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And do you remember that the Metreon

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
We went to the Metreon the day we decided to do the radio show

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
We came up with the name and everything

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
OLR was born on a trip to the Metreon

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
The third mix that was half-faded

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
The fifth mix that was half-faded

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Yep, I remember that

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
At that cool little arcade

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And that was when they had the little oops I went to hell store

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Or whatever that chick was

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Oh, I can't remember the name

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Oops I went to hell store

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
No, the chick was on all these shirts

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
That say oops I just ran over or something

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Or oops I had sex with your boyfriend

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
That was like the little niche on all these shirts

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And I just remember getting one that said oops I went to hell

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Oh

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't remember the name of the character

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It wasn't an Emily

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I don't think so, I don't know, anyway forget it

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
But I've seen Nightmare Before Christmas there twice

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah, they have the IMAX theater and everything

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Well now it's owned by Westfield

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
That happened a couple years ago

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
It got changed over, but here's the thing is that they still have the Sony store

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Well, guess what

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Apparently in an interview with GameSpot

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
Sony has said the lease for the Metreon

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
For the Playstation store will expire this summer

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
We have chosen not to renew it

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
They are saying the lease expires on March 31st

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
So the Sony store is going to be closing

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It's kind of sad in a way

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I mean it is and it isn't

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I mean the Sony store was a little you know

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
A little overpriced and glamorous

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I mean well they charge

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
They charge the same price you pay in any store

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
But they didn't really have sales

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Or anything like that going on there

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Everything was very high end or whatever

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
It was very nice

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
But it was still kind of nice that Sony had an official place

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
You know what I mean?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
And they did all their launch parties there

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
There were some Final Fantasy things that went on there

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
It's kind of sad

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It is the end of an era in a way

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Anyhow

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
By the way speaking of the launch parties

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Sony has apparently said

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
They are still always looking at new avenues

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
For additional retail exposure in space

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
But they felt it best not to continue with a dedicated

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Playstation store at the Metreon at this time

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Again if you haven't caught on yet

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
The Metreon

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Is right off of 4th street in San Francisco

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Gonna be closing

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
The Sony store is closing

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Not the whole thing

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
There are a couple of other notable things about the Metreon

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Apart from having a pretty decent arcade there

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Is there is the

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Video game

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Walk of Fame

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I don't know if they still have that

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I thought it was still there

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I don't remember

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I thought it might have changed hands when it went to Westfield

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
But I'm not sure

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
It's been there since it changed hands

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Was it? Okay

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
I haven't been since it was Sony

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It's been a couple of years since I've been

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
And it was still Sony last time I went

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I went not too long ago

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
You could tell the place was hurting

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Because this was right when the first arcade they had closed

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
It was empty

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
It was hurting

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I mean this was a couple of years ago

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Before everybody said the economy was going to crap

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And now just double that with

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
A bummer

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
There's not much good news left anyway

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
You know in other

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Square related news

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
The Squenix boss

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Yoichi Wada

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Said that

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Dragon Quest 10

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Since it's being delayed it would cause problems

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
For the release of Final Fantasy 13

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Well

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It's just that they can't

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Really be sure

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
If it's going to affect it or not

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
But Dragon Quest 9

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Is going to be

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Delayed from March to July

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
And they don't know if that's going to cause

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Final Fantasy 13 to get pushed back

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It's actually supposed to be out

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
In Japan this year

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Over here and in Europe

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Next year sometime around

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
April 2010

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It was also reported that

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
3D Realms mentioned that the

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Delay on Dragon Quest

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
10 also

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Is going to be delaying Duke Nukem forever

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Oh gee

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Even though the games have nothing in common

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Hey

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It's very much in common both are going

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Through delays

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
But there is though a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy 13

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Out so look for it

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Another new one or is this the same one

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
That was out a couple weeks ago

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I think it's the one that's been out for a couple weeks

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
The one that shows some of the battle and CGI

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Boy oh boy

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
So Final Fantasy 13 needed another delay

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The slimes Rob, slimes

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Well at this point though

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I'm just kind of used to it

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Final Fantasy 13 it will be out when it's out

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I take it back I don't think it's Dragon Quest 9

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Or Dragon Quest 10

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
It's 9

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Oh I said 10

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Never mind

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Dragon Quest 10 will be delayed until 2012

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I'm sure 10 is also delayed

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
I'm sure 10 will be out eventually

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
So therefore they can't start working on 10

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
That makes sense to me

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I bet you anything 10 is on the Wii

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Or whatever it may be Nintendo's next system

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Because the last Dragon Quest game that they had on the Wii

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Was so awesome

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I'm just saying

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
They'll go for wherever the big market is

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
We'll see

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Well then the next Dragon Quest game

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Would be in my pants

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
The biggest market out there

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Oh shush

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I don't want to know about that because of slimes

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Because Activision

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Has talked about their

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
2009 lineup

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
It probably will surprise you that there is

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 coming out this year

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I know shocking

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Seeing as that was pretty much

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Going to come out this year anyways

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
And then apparently

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
There's some sort of

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Racing game that Bazaar is

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Working on

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Some unannounced racing game

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That's kind of Mario Kart meets Forza

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Which that'd be kind of cool

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And then of course

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Prototypes sometime this year

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Probably around June

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
And you better believe

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
That there's probably going to be tons of freaking

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Guitar Hero games

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Because they already said there's going to be a ton

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Yeah there probably will be a ton

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I don't think they're going to renege on that

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Hmm

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
But only

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Half the company is going to E3 right?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Yes

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
There's no Blizzard in this

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Activision Blizzard

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Which doesn't make any sense to me because you can't

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
You're one company you can't have half your company not go

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
No they can get away with it because everybody

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Knows about Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Which is we all know what Blizzard will be showing

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
So what the hell

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Nobody wants to see those

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Well they know everybody already knows about it

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Everybody wants to see Guitar Hero greatest hits

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Or how to run a franchise

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Into the ground without ever even really trying

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Well I think the reason why they're probably

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Not going to be obviously going to E3 is

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Because then if they show all this stuff off

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
All their big announcements for Blizzcon

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Will be ruined

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Because they're going to PAX

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
No they're going to Blizzcon

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
And seriously if they show it at E3 it has to come out

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
You know like Starcraft Ghost

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I'm

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I'm looking at some comments from chatroom

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Tigerclaw says

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Tigerclaw is talking about the whole Dragon Quest thing

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Yeah because Dragon Quest made you just in my pants

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
A little reference to the Saturday Night Live sketch

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Get it?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Your album just came out

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I'm on a boat

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Can you imagine though if Dragon Quest X really was in Loki's pants

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
A wild schlong approaches

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
A wild schlong approaches

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
A wild schlong approaches

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
A wild schlong approaches

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Just in my pants

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Alright

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I'm selecting run

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Well something

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Something that has run away

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Far far away is the release date

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Guild Wars 2

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Sad

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
I know Guild Wars 2 originally was supposed to be out

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Like in 2008 remember that

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Like it was supposed to be out in 2008

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I remember 2008 like it was last year

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Yes it was

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And then it got pushed back

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
And now it's been pushed back

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
2010 to 2011

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Is the new time frame for when Guild Wars 2

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Is supposed to be out if you can believe it

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
That's a huge release window

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I'm assuming that sometime in the fiscal year

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Let's wait until people you know have jobs

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Or forgot what Guild Wars 2

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Is about I don't know

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I got devastated on Kotaku for saying it

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Doesn't matter

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Nobody buys Guild Wars

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
The people who play Guild Wars care

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Nobody new is playing it so

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
It's not wow so nobody cares

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
The people playing Guild Wars

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Are the people that bought it way back when it came out

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
So they didn't have to pay the monthly fee

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And they're still playing it after all this time

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
But I think their new subtitle

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Or not Gears of War

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Guild Wars 2 will actually

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Improve you know their

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Client base

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Guild Wars 2 now with rampant nudity

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Ooh naked

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Big booby adventure

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Well how about

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
How about something a little bit different

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
I just want to say real quick though the delay

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Possibly because of the layoffs that NCSoft

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Has just had and to note

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
They're also skipping E3 this year

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
NCSoft kind of has some issues going on anyway

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Going out of business

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Let's hope not because there's a lot of

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Guild Wars fans will be very upset

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Just as long as if they go out of business

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Not a lot of Guild Wars fans

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
The standalone

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
City of Heroes player creator

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
For all the updated outfits

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
And stuff

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I just want to say though like at PAX

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I remember we were live one night remember how we did the whole

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
All games thing live at PAX and we were all at the table

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm sorry Rob I don't remember that

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Going through the memory banks and find it because I remember

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
One night we were sitting at the table

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And there was a line coming out the door

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
For the panel and one of them

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Had to do a Guild Wars I remember

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I distinctly remember it was a Guild Wars panel because I think we were making

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Fun of Guild Wars a little bit while all the people were in line

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
And getting scow that

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
But of course every panel at PAX had a line

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Going out the door and around and down the stairs

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
So we had like captive audiences

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
The piracy one was hilarious

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Anyhow sorry

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I almost pirated the game during the piracy panel

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I remember Loki trying to do that

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
He was trying to pirate a game during the piracy panel

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Just to be ironic

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
You're such an ass Loki

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
So

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Jackassery

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
So how about

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
People who are Warhammer 40k

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Fans which is not

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Me because I get tired

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Of the stupid little figures

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
I'm sorry I had a bad

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
For our listeners who don't know I had a bad

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Experience with an ex who was addicted to Warhammer

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
40k and his stupid retarded little

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Lead figures and having to paint them

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
But I'm not bitter

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
My sister's ex actually is really into Warhammer

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
40k and he does paint the figures

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And he also

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Larks and also

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Plays Vampire the Masquerade

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I LARPed but then I grew up

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I just want to point out on wife swap

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
This week it was a LARPer

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
No

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
They swapped with

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
What what

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
They're tasty

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
This explains a lot actually

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
This is why Dan's not allowed to eat

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Anything that I don't approve of

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
First

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Anyway

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
So they're working on

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
A beta now for

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Well actually they had the beta out for

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Dawn of War 2

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
And that it has

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Already prompted

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
A big massive

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Patch lots of changes

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
To go into the game

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
So it is

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Supposed to be

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Going through so if any of the

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Beta players can actually say anything about it

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
And I'm sure there's NDA's and

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Whatnot about that

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
They need the patch since it comes out what like

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Next week I mean

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Seriously

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Who knows we might be seeing a delay if it's big enough

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
But it was it had to be

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Enough that you know if they're gonna

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
In fact actually

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I think this is kind of a fun quote put out

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
By Relic

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Sometimes we just make mistakes

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
We're only human after all

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
But other times there are very good and well thought out

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Reasons behind the changes

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Oh we forgot to put legs on the goblins

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Now they can't move

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Shoot naked

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
How about a hug we're only human after all

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
I want them to leave in naked

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
We are the world

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
You know what

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
What

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
It's war hammer just go

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Play with the lead figures instead

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And make real friends

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Eat the lead figures

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Nice

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Seriously get out of your house and

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Eat some lead figures

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
They're not candy

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I know

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
See that's what they should do war hammer

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
40k gummy figures

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
That way when you destroy their army

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
You can literally bite off their heads

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Yeah you're just like oh battle damage

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Why don't you just use goldfish

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
That would actually be a pretty awesome type of role playing game

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Like I want to come up with a role playing game

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That's like gummy bear warfare or something

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
You could why not they have fuzzy heroes

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I mean it would be awesome

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Fuzzy heroes the game you use with stuffed animals

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Out of jello wigglers

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
TM

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Oh my god I like want to create my own

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Role playing game now that involves me eating

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It's gotta play like advance wars

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Figure this out

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Or totally make it out of chocolate shell and ice cream

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Or even better a role playing game

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
That's you know comprised of completely

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
With snack food and like you could build

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Units with different snack foods

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Dark Tetsuya says OL RPG

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I'm starting to like this idea

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Maybe our fantasy

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Yeah I was gonna say maybe our dream game company

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Can not just make console games but will make

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Table top games too

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
And OL RPG will be

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
All based around food

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Just fat princess with RPG elements

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Yes I like this idea it's fat princess for real

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
This is a good idea

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I approve of this thought

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Apparently there's a new

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Game coming out that was

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Revealed during Nintendo

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Of Japan's fall media conference

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Of course there

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Was it wasn't

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Really a big title it's a game called

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Kensax and what this is

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Is actually a first party game

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
That is tied

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
With a search engine

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Basically you have

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Different games that are in there

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
That require

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Looking for you know

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Making searches on the search engine

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
And based on the amount of hits

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
That you get you get points

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
So for example

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
You know they may have like

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
You know battle search panel 9

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
It says task players

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Or four players with combining the words

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
From a stock

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Of words with a 3x3 board

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
And you conduct different search terms

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
And whoever finds the

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Highest hit count wins

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
And then they have some

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Finding a certain amount

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Plus you can also update it I guess

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
It has a library of 3000 words

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
And you can add more to it

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And then of course you go online

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
To increase

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
The vocabulary plus

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Update search results

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I would think if anything had sex or porn

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
In it you're gonna win

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
This game sounds stupid and boring

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
It sounds like something that you do

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
When you're at work

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And you're on a firewall connection

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Where they've locked out anything good

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
And all you can do is just find something

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
To amuse yourself

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
That's exactly what this sounds like

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Dan's got it

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Yeah I know all about that

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
This is so bad it makes me want to punch myself

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Right in the face

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Let's see

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Punch yourself in the face

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
How many search results do we get from that?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
A lot

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
The question is

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
How many results down do you have to go

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Before you actually hit porn?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Punch yourself in the face

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
265,000 results

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Porn? How many results for porn?

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
245 million for porn

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Porn wins!

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
The internet is for porn

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
How about boobs?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Only 60 million for boobs? What's up with that?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Anyway, sorry

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Because one thinks if you've got porn

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Boobs come with it

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
I mean seriously

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Where there's porn there's boobs

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Hey! Where there's Mario and Sonic

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
There's bound to be the Olympics

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Or something like that

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Of course Mario and Sonic at the Summer Games

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Ended up being pretty much a sleeper hit for Sega

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
So it's probably no surprise

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
That Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Is official

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
And Sega did announce it earlier this week

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Will once again compete on the Wii S

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
And the DS in Vancouver

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
The Wii S?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I said the Wii and the DS, right?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
You said the Wii S and the DS

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Works fine

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
The Wii S

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
In Vancouver

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Is where of course the 2010 Olympic Games

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Are being held

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Just in case you want to know how big that first

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Mario game was, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
The first one, 10 million units globally

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
By the way, the new one

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
The Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
Is going to support the Wii Balance Board

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Some of the events that will be in it

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Speed skating, alpine skiing

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
So on and so on, no news about curling

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
But I hope to hell they did not forget curling

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
So there you have it, Mario and Sonic

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
At the Winter Olympics

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
They are making a deck of sporta too

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Are they really? Yes

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
You need to branch the whole and Sonic out

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Of the Olympic Games to other mascots

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Like Master Chief and Sonic

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
At the Olympic Games

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Game Guru suggests the next game should be

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Mario and Sonic at the Special Olympics

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
I don't know about that

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That might be

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I don't think that got picked up

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Dan was off mic

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Dan said it had to be

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Tails and Toad

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
At the Special Olympics

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
All the characters there

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
But he doesn't care about it anymore

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Toadette, I can't stand Toadette

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Toadette definitely is in the Special Olympics

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Game

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
They need to do an evil one with

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Waluigi and Shadow

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
He's trying to destroy the Olympics

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Okay sad trombone

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Sad trombone

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Hey release dates, happy trombone

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Actually can I do a plug? No

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Of course you can do a plug

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Just because

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
I am true to my word

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I would actually like to

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Plug a

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Website

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
That my

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Only teacher this semester

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Happens to have

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Because I'm sure that we've

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Got other designers

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
And people listening to this show

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
So I did want to go ahead and give his website a little

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Plug

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
If you go to mahalo.com

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Go look at his fonts

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
They're great

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Now see

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Was that painless?

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Wait spell that again?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
M-E-H-A-L-L-O

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
He designs fonts

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Oh very cool

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
We have a new web page

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
On the way

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
That's right

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
How about release dates

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
How about release dates?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Well those are the games that

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Stuff is released on

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Anyway how about the

Kai and Zero on DS

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
In the PlayStation 3 version you get

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Ken

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
A figure of Ken

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
In the US

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Over you

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Which was the one we got Ken

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Oh it was Ryu nevermind

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
No we had a conversation

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
About that

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Oh yeah and also that Warhammer piece of shit

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Yeah hell yeah

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Of course Dan will argue with you

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Until he is red in the face

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Ken's cooler

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Just cause he wears red

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Which is why I said red in the face

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Not blue in the face

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
But yeah that Warhammer crap comes out too

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Not a big

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Warhammer fan are ya?

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
No

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
This week in the US we have the

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Today is not the 16th

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000

Battle Rage on the Wii

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Which sort of looks like

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
A virtual lawn but

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Probably crap

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
That's pretty much it

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Busy week in Japan for the Japanese release

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Starting off on the Xbox 360

Get this

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
It's from a company called Triangle Service

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Right

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I am not

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
You cannot make this stuff up

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And it is a shooting game

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Just so you guys know

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
There's the cover

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
It looks like it's a compilation of other games

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm not sure but

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
It looks like it's those old school type of shooting games

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
That are so popular in Japan

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000

In Japan

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
On the Playstation 2 Biohazard Code Veronica complete

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
That would of course be Resident Evil

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Sacred Blaze is a big game coming out this week

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
From Flight Plan

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
That's pretty much what you got coming out

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
On the Playstation 2

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Taking a quick look at the Nintendo DS

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Lock's Quest this week

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Sarusaru DS Sim Animals as well

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Simple DS Vol. 46

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
If you can believe it

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
The Hikio Takentai

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Shotoko Special

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Force Feather is the big release from Sega

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
This week on the DS

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
And lastly on the PSP

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Grand Theft Auto Vice City

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Stories gets a price reduction

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Idol Master SP

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Perfect Sun looks to be the other big release

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Perfect Sun, Wandering Star

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
And Missing Moon all come out

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
From Namco Bandai on the PSP this week

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
In Japan

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Remember the good old days when the PSP got games

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
And wasn't just used to emulate old consoles

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Yeah but Idol Master

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Is a huge thing in Japan

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
I don't think it caught on over here

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
I don't really know how you would describe Idol Master

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Never came out over here

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I was totally looking forward to that new Idol Master game

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Isn't it like a take on

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
American Idol type thing

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
But it's not actually a singing game

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
You guide your contestants through these games somehow

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
I don't know

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
It's like a sim game

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
There was a game that I used to have on

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
What?

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I used to talk about something irrelevant

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Anyway

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I was actually talking about Dreamcast

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
It was a game called Super Producers

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
That I never got very far in

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
But the way that it was

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
There were different mini games in it

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
That you would manage a pop idol's career

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I don't think it sold very well

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Over there though even

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
But it was a weird game

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I'm telling you, you need to bring back

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
CNC Music Factory

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Make the video thing

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Or something

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Some other type of

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Make the music video game

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Dan was talking about a Cliquavision game

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
That was here

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
No

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I don't recall

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
A manager game

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Maybe a football manager game

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I remember those guys

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I had one of those on the Commodore 64

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Of course I didn't know what the hell I was doing

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Anyhow

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
That's going to do it for release dates

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Well, Midway

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Weren't we just singing the joys of Midway

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Last week

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
I don't know if you'd say the joys

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Well we were talking about how

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Midway was the

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Pretty cool

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Especially back in the day

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Their arcade collections will really show you

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
How awesome they are

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
They haven't had a lot lately going for them

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Even more than that now

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
They have filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Sad trombone

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Basically the CEO

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Matt Booty

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I'm trying not to laugh

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Said that it was a difficult but necessary

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Decision

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Basically for those who don't know

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Chapter 11 gives you

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Relief from your creditors

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
So that you can regroup

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
And get your financial plan back together

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
So

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Some of those creditors that they

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Owed money to

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
At the tune of $281 million

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
In liabilities

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
And of course they only have

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
$167 million in assets

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Wells Fargo Bank

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
They owe $150 million to

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
National Amusements

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
They owe

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Close to $20 million

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And apparently they paid for the manufacturing

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Costs during the

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
For Midway's Holiday lineup

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
NBA Properties Inc

58:30.000 --> 58:34.000
Almost $17.3 million

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
In licensing and royalty fees

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Warner Brothers Interactive

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
$6.6 million

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
And Epic Games

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
$1.975 million

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
For licensing and royalty fees

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Probably for Unreal Tournament

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Kind of interesting

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
That they are

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Doing so horribly

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I also read another story

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
That apparently somebody had purchased

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Controlling shares of Midway

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
For only $100,000

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
So some dude out there

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Owns like 80% of the company

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Now with $100,000

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
The mystery investor

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Yes

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
They inherited like

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Millions and millions of dollars in debt

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
And basically paid

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Virtually nothing for

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Tons of the rights

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
But yeah it's like the mystery investor

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Well supposedly he's supposed to be protected from the debts

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
But he's still gonna make more than

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
$100,000 on the deal

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Oh yeah cause he's gonna get all the rights

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Then he's gonna make

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Mortal Kombat out of his basement

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Mortal Kombat

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Versus like the Care Bears or something

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Mortal Kombat versus your mom

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Nice

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
This doesn't mean though

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
That Midway is like shutting its doors

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Or anything it just means

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
But it's not a good sign

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
They might as well

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Just sell Mortal Kombat to somebody else

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Really other than like

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Mortal Kombat there hasn't been a lot that they've put out lately

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That's been any good

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That's not the purpose though of Chapter 11

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Chapter 11

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Is meant for a company

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That they see recovery in their future

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
This just gives them

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Momentary relief

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Well I have to say though what I think of

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
When I think of Chapter 11 in this day and age

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Is like remember what happened with Mervins

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
The big clothing store chain here in California

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Mervins filed for Chapter 11 and not even a week later

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
They were gone

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Like the liquidators were coming into town

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So you have to worry a little bit

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
It's still a preemptive step

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I mean look at a claim

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Chapter 11 bankruptcy basically

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Gives a company a chance to come to terms

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
With its creditors

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And if the financing is not out there

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
They're hosed

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Circuit City closed down after being in Chapter 11

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I mean if you go back to

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
The 80's

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
This is 80's style

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Worlds of Wonder who made Teddy Ruxpin and laser tech

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Yeah

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
They were in Chapter 11 for years

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Because they had strong properties

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And people were always like

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Man we got to extend these guys some credit

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Because they're going to pull it up

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
No they just kept nose diving like 1991

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And if only they had combined

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Teddy Ruxpin and laser tech together

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
They would have been an unstoppable force

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I bet you they did

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I bet you that somewhere

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
At Worlds of Wonder there was a laser tech

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
That you could like shoot at Teddy Ruxpin

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And he'd be like stop stop

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Aren't you my friend

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Were they the ones that made my buddy

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
My buddy

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
No that was Galoob

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
What happened to Galoob are they

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Micro machines

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Galoob I think got bought up by Hasbro

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Or Mattel or somebody significant

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Yeah I think because they're still

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Making micro machines and those are Galoob

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
As well if I remember right

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I actually think micro machines are now put out under the Hasbro

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Label I think

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
No they probably bought it up

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
If it doesn't say micro machines

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
It's not the real thing

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
What ever happened to that guy that talks really fast

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Is he still alive

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
No he's alive

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I'm confused with the guy who is the scat man

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
That guy died

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
John Machito isn't that his name

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I get them mixed up they not only look similar

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But you know

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
The scat man guy looks like

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
The micro machines guy

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Oh I see you mean the one from the video

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That one

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Scat man carter

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
He's like massively dead

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Am I crazy surely people remember the scat man song

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
John Machito is still alive

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Alright good

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Thank you Stufra

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Speaking of companies

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And all this crazy bankruptcy

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And whatever is going on

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
This isn't bankruptcy but it's an acquisition

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Apparently Namco Bandai is looking to

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Acquire D3

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
They're going to buy all of D3 stock

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Apparently

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Namco has already apparently made some deals

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
With the board over at D3

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
They're going to have a 70% stake in the company

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I guess they already have it

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
They're going to purchase the remaining 30%

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
At about $680 a share

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
They're going to have controlling interest

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
In the Naruto property

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Doesn't D3 also make

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Onichibara

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah they do a lot of the ports of the simple series games

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Which really I don't know who the

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Japanese companies are that make these

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
But they need to pump out more of them

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I want to see zombies vs ambulances over here

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Remember when Namco was great

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Now they're just watering it down

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
First they poured in a big bucket

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Of Namco or Bandai

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And I mean

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I know Bandai is huge in Japan

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
And they make toys and everything but they make crappy ass games

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
And Namco made awesome games

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And now Namco Bandai makes kind of crappy games

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And now you're just going to pour another company in there

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And it's funny you bring that up

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Because they're actually saying that

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
D3 could benefit from

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Especially the Bandai arm, they make the toys

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
TV, arcade

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
They make all this other stuff, movies and stuff

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
That could actually

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Maybe help D3

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Maybe we could get, I don't know, Oni Chambara

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
The TV show, that would be kind of awesome actually

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Bring the movie over

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Maybe we could get some Bikini Samurais and Tekken

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
There you go

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
That'd be kind of cool

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That'd be very cool

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
But anyway look for that to happen very soon

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Why can't we have another Klonoa?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Aren't they bringing the Klonoa remake to Wii or something?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Yeah it's coming out

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
We need a new Klonoa

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Next few months, May I think

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Klonoa is awesome

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
More acquisition news

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You know

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Squeenix

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Is trying to make a purchase

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And Squeenix

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Has done a lot of things

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
That have made us go

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
What? Over

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
But they are trying to purchase

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Eidos

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And they're trying to

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Basically buy it

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
More than it's worth using

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
129%

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Over their current market value

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
We're looking at

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Grabby grabby Squeenix

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
We're looking at

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
80's style takeover

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
If they want it, they're gonna get it

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
You know what Squeenix does

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It's ours

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
However

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I do have to say

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
That Kotaku is my hero

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
For using a picture of dead Eris

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
To advertise this

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
So

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
That makes me quite happy

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Kind of an interesting merger

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
If you think about it

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
With the whole

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Tomb Raider series

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Going

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
You know

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
What else does Eidos have over there?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I can't remember some of the other big stuff they publish

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Hitman

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
They have Just Cause coming out

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
At some point

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Well Just Cause 2 at least

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Interesting because those are the

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Types of games Squeenix never really seems

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
To get involved with so that would be a very interesting

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Sort of merger especially if Squeenix is really wanting

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
To get into the western development or whatever

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You know

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
You guys are killing me with this Squeenix thing by the way

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It's Squeenix

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
We like to call it Squeenix

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
The god damn company is called Enix

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
It's Squeenix

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Actually it's Square Enix

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
It's the whole thing

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
They don't abbreviate it at all

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
But we say Squeenix

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Squeenix is terrible

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
That's the most bizarre merger

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
You wonder why Square Enix would even bother

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You know

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Any decent franchises that Eidos had

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Any good development studios that they had

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
They're pretty much flushed

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I mean

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I guess you might get a

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Kane and Lynch, woo!

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Kane and Lynch, yeah!

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Battle Stations

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I think that series

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
So the Battle Stations Pacific or something

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Is coming out

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yeah, it's nothing that's really exciting

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
You know, Tomb Raider is kind of what they have

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And like I said

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Maybe Hitman

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Although you gotta wonder about the viability of the Hitman

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Franchise because they didn't even bring out a game to go with

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It's really crappy movie

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
You know, what are you

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Gonna do with that company?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Tomb Raider RPG?

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You know, I don't know

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Maybe it would save the franchise a little bit

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
AlphaKananagram in chat suggests

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It's called Square Anus

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Is actually what the chat

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Actually it's

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Don't even guess on NX, because NX is an awesome company

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And Square used to be great too

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's the bizarre combination of them that just

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Has fallen into RPG hell

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Remember when Square made Einhonder?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Remember when NX made fucking Actraiser?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Yeah, and NX made Actraiser

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And Illusion of Gaia

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And that whole series

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Secret of Mana

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Bust a Move

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Dude, NX made Bust a Move

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Those companies just made

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Great games, now it's just

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Rehash for old RPGs

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Bring out new crappy JRPGs

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
You know, what? Come on

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
This is what I demand out of Square Enix for

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Penance, is a new Bust a Move game

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
That's what I want

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
None of this Dance Summit 2001 crap

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
No, Burn in Hell

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's got to have Hero-kun

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And it's got to have Heat and Sprite

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I want a reboot of the Bust a Move series

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
It's got to be completely uncensored when they bring it to America

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
So people are smoking and drinking and shooting each other

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
And then they dance their way out of it

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
That game was awesome

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
That game was beyond awesome

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I love the fact that one of the attacks was that Strike was shooting you

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
In fact, I just gave you

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
We should put it right now

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Squenix, I gave you the new tagline

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Bust a Move 3, Beyond Awesome

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Bust a Move

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Dance or Bust a Cap on your end

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Bust a Cap

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
You got served

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Rama says God dammit Square Enix

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I want Rad Racer 3

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Yeah, Rad Racer rules

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Only if it has

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
3D when you hit the select button

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Yeah, and you've got to be able to change the tracks

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And the Nintendo music has to be there

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Which in this day and age, it might actually be

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Kind of doable with this whole stuff they're talking about

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
3D, can you imagine

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Remember when they were talking about that the Wii's top secret thing

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Was going to be 3D projection

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
In your room and all this fucking bullshit

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Why did we ever believe that fucking shit

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Because that would be super awesome

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And really innovative

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And then they're like, no, we don't want to do that

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
People love to give Nintendo

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Way more credit than they deserve

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Anyhow, forget it

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Let's uh

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Let's get into some other stories

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Sorry

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Because remember it's only good for Nintendo

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
To innovate unless it will benefit their

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Casual audience

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
That's what it really comes down to

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Yes, indeed

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So if you're a casual

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Game purchaser

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Perhaps you're looking for a rental

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Solution, in which case

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
You know, of course there's Gamefly

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Out there for you, but if you don't want to do

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Gamefly, maybe Blockbuster Total

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Access. They actually

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Had Total Access for a while now with

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Movies, but now they've incorporated games

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Into their subscription plan

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And basically it will work

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Kind of similar to

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
You know, how it does with movies

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Except it'll cost a little bit more if you rent a game

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I think it's like, it upsets five

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Additional dollars

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
The plans are $19.99 a month

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
You know, for the movie side and of course

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
$5 if a game is

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Rented as well

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And then what's kind of different with

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
The Total Access plan versus

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Gamefly, is Gamefly

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
You can only mail your stuff back

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
With Total Access you can actually take it into a store

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And swap it in a store

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So you can do it in the store or over the mail

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
So, that's kind of neat

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I'm thinking about switching to the Blockbuster thing

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Only because they have this whole in the store thing

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That you can do, and sometimes I don't want to wait for

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Netflix, you know

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Well, in the store is not a bad thing

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Especially with Gamefly and stuff

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's a good program to get stuff mailed to you

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But sometimes you want the instant gratification

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Where you can just go to the store

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Okay, I want to rent that game, done

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
But I don't want to lose instant Netflix

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Like, I also like instant Netflix

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
That would be ultimate

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
But the Netflix streaming is awesome

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
There is a rumor though

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
That they're going to somehow incorporate this

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Into the Playstation Network

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Oh, please let this be true

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
So, I don't know if that's actually going to happen or not

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
But it's rumored that

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Maybe they're thinking about it

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Sony can't do anything that cool anymore

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So, don't bet on it

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Sony will find a way to screw it up

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I wish they would prove you wrong on that

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
It would be great though if you were walking around at home

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And you could walk up to your TV and turn it on

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And like, you know, your total access menu

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Would come up and you had streaming

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Or I could just bypass that home bullshit

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Just hit a button

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You could make your dude sit down and watch it

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And look bored, I think that would be awesome

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And then smoke a bowl

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
That's what I think

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Watching Cheech and Chung on Blockbuster

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So, it would be really interesting

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
If they had, you know

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Context sensitive reactions

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So, if they watch a sad movie

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
They'll sit there and cry

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
If they watch Cheech and Chung, they'll sit there and neck toke

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Which would be hilarious

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Not likely, but hilarious

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
But I just think that would be pretty cool

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Yeah, somehow I don't think that would get by

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Like the Sony sensors or what have you

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Well, I don't think the smoking dope thing would happen

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
But I think that, you know, having your little dude watch TV

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I mean, come on

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
A bajillion freaking people play The Sims

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
So, you know, and they watch

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Their Sims do nothing

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I don't want that home bullshit

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Then don't use it, you don't have to

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I'm saying it would be cool if it was there

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
God damn it, you're missing the point

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Just so I could see it that one time and go

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Wow, that's fucking cool, okay, I'm done

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
There you go

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
It's like a stream saver for your life

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It's called how many millions of dollars does Sony have to spend

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
To get me to say, wow, that's fucking cool, next

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Well, if it makes someone say

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Wow, that's fucking cool enough for me to buy a PS3

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I mean, come on

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
How many systems has Nintendo sold with the controller

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
For the Wii

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
People are like, ooh, I can wave my hand

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
This is great, oh wow, it really sucks

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
For actual gameplay

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
That's really sad

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I don't know

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I don't know what to tell you

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
But yeah

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You can look for that blockbuster

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Thing coming soon, I guess

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Or is that now, that you can do the game thing now

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I think it's very soon

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
If not now

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I kind of want to do that, but I still want Netflix too

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
For streaming

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Just quandary

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
I don't want both, it's too much money

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Or just, I don't know, go rent a movie

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Here's the other thing

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
If you change your address

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Hollywood Video will send you a bunch of these

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Welcome to the neighborhood

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Free game or free movie

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
My sister has moved apartments

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
In her complex a few times

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
She's got a ton of those things

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
She keeps bouncing from different Hollywood videos

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Because they'll let her do it over and over

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Or if she doesn't rent anything

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
From a Hollywood video for a while

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
They'll eventually call her and say, hey, do you want free rental

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Come back in the store type thing

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
So she bounces between three different Hollywood videos

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And they keep sending her those

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
That sounds like entirely too much effort

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
To save the five, six bucks

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
She's poor, so yeah

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
She's poor

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Entertainment? However I could get it

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Alright

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Hey the DS Lite Onyx version

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
That would be the black one for most of us

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Call it the Black DS Lite

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Apparently, shut up, apparently

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
It has been discontinued

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
At least

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
That is the rumor

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Going on

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And Loki is confirming

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
It's happened

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Nintendo is discontinuing the Onyx DS Lite

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I have a rare system then

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Black DS Lite

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Is coming out the door

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
The only four colors left

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Metallic Silver, Metallic Rose

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Black in Cobalt Blue

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And Black in Crimson Red

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Pink, Pinker, Pinkest, and Very Pink

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Are the four colors that are left

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Of the DS

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Is this because

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
This is kind of the thought process

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Going around

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
That a DSi is coming relatively soonish

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And that the DSi is going to be black

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
They did the same thing

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
With the White DS

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
After a while they just want to stop

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Making

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
A certain color

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I don't know

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Because five colors is too many

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But four is just right I guess

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I guess

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Anyhow, let's get into

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
A segment of the show we like to do every week

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It's a moment for us to respect the classics

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
We need to pay tribute to those games

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
That came before the ones we're talking about this week

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
It's a little segment we call

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Dark Sakura's Classic Video Game of the Week

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Dark Sakura has dug through

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The Classic Game Archive, I'm assuming with Dan's

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Help a little bit this week, and has picked

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
One game to highlight

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
For you folks on the show tonight

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
What game have you picked?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Today's game is The Revenge of Shinobi

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And Dan did inspire me to pick it

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
We had

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
A little bit of a conversation last night

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
About copyrighted characters

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Making their way into

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Different releases of this game

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So I thought it would be worth mentioning

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Plus it does have some pretty cool music

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
As I was about to say

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
This soundtrack is

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
By Yuzo Koshiro

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
And

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
It's actually

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
You can also find it in the Mega Games 2

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Mega Drive 6-Pack, Sega Classics

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Arcade Collection for Sega CD

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And the Sega Smash Pack for PC and Dreamcast

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
But not on Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Book

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Also the

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Is saying that the introductory game screen

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Has

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Sonny Chiba

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
As Hattori Hanzo

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
From the Kage no Gungan series

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So that's pretty cool

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Anyway

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
It is a side schooling platform

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Game

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
You control Joe Musashi

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And go through 8th districts

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
And you actually have to

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Defeat the head of Mio Zeed

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
There's three scenes in each level

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
With their own boss characters

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
And you use the D-Pad, A, B, and C buttons

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
To do your

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Ninjutsu attack

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Your regular attack, and your jump

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And you also have a somersault

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Move

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
That you can press the jump button

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And then press it again

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
At the height of your jump

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
So that you can jump more

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And throw eight shuriken in the air

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
At the same time

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
So

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
You can actually go

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Over different layers

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
In the area

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Like you can be in the foreground

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
In the background, indoor, outdoor

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Or on the highway

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You have

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
You have different

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Ninjutsu techniques

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
You've got

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Ninjutsu no

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Ikazuchi

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Karyu, Fushin, and Mijin

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And respectively

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
The first one is lightning

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
The second one is flame

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
The third one is more jumping

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
And the last one is explosions

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
It actually costs you one life

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
But

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
If you don't have a life

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Then you can't do it

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
You also have bonus crates

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
That have stuff hidden in them

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
So you can just go beat up stuff

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
It has easy, normal, hard, and hardest

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Just meaning more enemies

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And a shorter life bar

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
The Japanese version called

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
The Super Shinobi

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
There are options

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
For no death

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And level select

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
The different stages

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Is Ibaraki

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
The province of Japan, Tokyo

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
The military base, Detroit

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Area code 818

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Chinatown

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
New York, and Neo-Z Marine

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Stronghold

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
So now we come to the different versions

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
As I was mentioning, there are different copyrighted characters

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
In the different versions

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And I think you had one

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Don't we have one?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
This game, just so everyone knows

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Was fucking awesome

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
It was the reason to buy a Genesis

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Back in the day

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And one of the things that was so great about it

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Besides the fact that it's got

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Brutal, unforgiving difficulty

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
If you don't push it out and play on easy

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Is that as you play through the game

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
You ran into

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Like, classic movies

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
There was a boss

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Who was Spider-Man

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And he stayed as Spider-Man

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Sega had a Spider-Man license

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
He would crawl on Spider-Man for a while

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
He would crawl off the screen

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
And he would come back and it was Batman

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And I mean, if it wasn't

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
You know, it wasn't a licensed Batman

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
But it would just like Batman

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And in one of the subsequent re-releases

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Of the same cartridge

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
It was the same game

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
They replaced him with, you know, a Batman

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Not Batman

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
One of the enemies looked like Rambo

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
They took off his hair

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
So he didn't look like Rambo anymore

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And there's a guy

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Who looks like, there's a Terminator

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I mean, he looks like Schwarzenegger

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
When you hit him, his skin starts coming off

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And he's a cyborg underneath

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And he blows up Terminator style

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And finally, there's Godzilla

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And it's, you know, Godzilla

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
You know, towering

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And breathing fire

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And they replaced him with a

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Like a weird skeleton

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Not Mechagodzilla

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Which would have been even cooler

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
That might be part of the reason why it missed out

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
On the Mega Genesis collection thing that just came out

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Is that maybe these strange licensed

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Bosses kept it out of the collection

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Well, it's strange enough

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Because Revenge of Shinobi

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
If you heard it, it's been on like six collections

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
It was on all the ones through the Dreamcast

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It was on

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
PC collections

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I mean, I'm sure that that's one of the things

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
That knocked it down, probably honestly

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
The Spider-Man license

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Because even in the

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
The Shinobi for the

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
For the

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
They recolored the quote-unquote

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Spider-Man enemies from

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Red and blue to yellow and blue

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
So, you know, probably a little bit of

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
You know, hey, don't want to get sued by

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Marvel this time around

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
But I'm sure that that's what it is

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
But the real pity of that is

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Is this would have been just an awesome

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Chance, you know, to

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
To have the Shinobi

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
One, two, and three

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
All at hand

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Yeah, that is the one bummer because with so many

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Complete Sega

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Franchises there, it's kind of a bummer to have this

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
One missing, but did you notice there's one other

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Big franchise that's missing, Strider

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Was missing

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Oh, it's Capcom, oh, that's right, it's not Sega

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I thought Sega did it

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I've been thinking about this

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And this is something that I can kind of go off about

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Because on Ultimate Genesis

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Collection, I mean, it's far from the

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Ultimate Genesis Collection

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
It's a great, great collection

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But it's got some clunkers that they could have

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Replaced with way better Sega games

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And I'm sure that that's being saved for Sonic's

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Even more Ultimate Genesis Collection, too

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
But, I mean, there was no Shadow Dancer

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
The Secret of Shinobi

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
You know, you could have had

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
More arcade unlockables, like

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
You had, you know, if you played Shinobi 3

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
You unlocked Shinobi 1, which was great

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I was so happy, but wouldn't it have been really cool

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
To have been able to play Shadow Dancer

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
The arcade version of Shadow Dancer

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Wouldn't it have been great to have been able to

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Have unlocked, you know, maybe

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Had Outrun on there

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Oh yeah, that was missing, huh

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
You know, just Thunder Blade

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
You know, they had Super Thunder Blade

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
But not the way better arcade Thunder Blade

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
After Burner, I mean, there were

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
So many significant, I mean, that thing could have had

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
30 more games

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
And then arcade versions of those same games

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And it just would have been just fantastic

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
But I guess you can't expect Sega

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Company for 30 bucks, I expected

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Though, so they should have done it

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
But yeah, it would have been really cool to have

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Just had the whole Shinobi franchise

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
In one place, you know, had the lock on

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Technology with the Sonic and that, but

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
You know, back to Revenge of Shinobi

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
It's awesome, if you have a Sega Genesis

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Kicking around, it's a super common

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Cartridge, you might get lucky

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Find that you have one of the early release cartridges

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
With all the, all the bosses

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Even the one I had back in the day, had the Rambo

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Guys edited, the one I have now

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Actually does have the Rambo Guys

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
So I was pretty stoked when I was playing it

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Super, super awesome game

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Really hard

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
There's more changes actually

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
They also did

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
For a release

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
1.02

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Which was the last release

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
They also did put up an

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Acknowledgement of the Spider-Man copyright

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And there was only

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
One ending you had to

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Save now, go to win the game

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah, the way that you get the ending in that game

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Is totally cool

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
You get into the final level

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And I think, I mean I'm sure a lot of people

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Have done it, because again, when you play, when you talk to people online

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
You always find out that the game you thought you were a

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Bato at, people are better

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
But to get the final ending

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
You had to fight the boss

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
While your girl ran around in the background

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And a giant cement block

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Lowered towards her

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And if you couldn't beat the boss fast enough

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
She got smooshed

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And you got a cool, solitary, ninja-like ending

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
And if you won

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
You know, you're standing there on the edge of the cliff

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
With your girlfriend, it looks like something out of Castlevania

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
But you have a girl with you

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
And it's awesome, so

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
You have to have some techniques

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
You can't just slop through the final boss battle

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
But yeah, I guess one of the later releases

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
You couldn't win if you didn't save your girlfriend

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Also

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
There was

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
In the European version

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
The shuriken is replaced by throwing knives

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Because of legal status at the time

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
It's

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Pretty cool, actually

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
A bunch of the music was performed

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
At the fourth symphonic

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Game music concert

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
In Leipzig

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And it was also performed

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
At two of the concerts of play

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
It's

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
It was also at the

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Same play concert

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
In Singapore in June 2007

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So there you go

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
That's super

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
That's for Revenge of Shinobi

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I was

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Alright, there you got it

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
As far as game music goes too

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
This made Yuzo Kishiro

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
So if you're into game music

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
If you're really interested in his work

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
And you haven't played Revenge of Shinobi

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
What are you doing?

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
So definitely one of the most notable

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Missing games from the

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Genesis collection just recently came out

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Revenge of Shinobi is the classic game of the week

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
So you'll have to check it out somehow else

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Besides the classic game collection

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
For those of you guys checking that out this week

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Good pick Dark Sakura and Dan

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
This week on the classic game

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Of the week

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And that is going to bring to a close

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
A new program but don't go anywhere

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
We'll be right back after a little break

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
With some more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And in part beats tonight we're going to be talking

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
A little bit about the new website

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I know it's some exciting new information

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Talk a little bit about Fear 2

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Grand Theft Auto 4

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
More Sega if you can believe it

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Some very interesting trademarks

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Persona 4

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And Konami getting a little taste

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Of their own medicine this week

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
We're going to be talking about that also a little bit

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
More of Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
On this Sunday evening February the 15th

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Of 2009 the day after

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Valentine's Day

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
And here in studio unfortunately JTV

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Stopped working

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
We were having problems on the server end so we just

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Decided to say screw it

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
And we hooked up Street Fighter 4

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Which is what we're playing right now on the in studio TV

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
We will try to get it up on Justin TV

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
If we're able to get back on there

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
We already tried reconnecting it didn't work

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
It's on there and it's something

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Some JTV channels are up but not us

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
But we'll be back on Justin TV hopefully soon

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
And it's just going to be footage of Street Fighter 4

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
With us talking so that should be interesting

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
When people tune into that

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
But wow this game looks pretty awesome

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Although this is not the TV to be demonstrating

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
That was the best ever

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Dan of course is playing Dan

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
His namesake character

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
He did a little special move

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
He's fighting El Fuerte right now

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And did this little special move that knocked him up in the air

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
But right at the end he did his signature little thumbs up

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And tooth shining pull thing

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That was great

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Nice

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I love that like one of the best characters

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
In the game

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Well one of the most fun characters in the game

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Is just a total joke

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Very very nice though

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I want to say this as well in the chat

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
And SSJ100Matt reminded me of this

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
At the top of part B as well

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
We got a swag bag from our New York

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
City contingent

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Specifically SSJ100Matt I believe

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Put this all together for us I don't know if he had some help

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Or what have you but we want to say a big

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Big thank you to them for getting

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Us some of the swag including lots of

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Stuff which Loki took it all

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
But we have like a Splatterhouse poster

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
We're going to put up here in studio and some other cool stuff too

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
So we're going to fill some of the blank space on our wall

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
With some of those posters from

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
The New York Comic Con

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
So thank you guys very very very very much for that

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Yay

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Alright so I'm just like hypnotized

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
By Street Fighter IV now I don't even know if I can do news

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I just kind of I really want to play it

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
I can do news

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Alright Loki why don't you start us off with some news

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I actually want to run in the house and get some tea

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So Street Fighter IV will have to wait

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And I think Dan doesn't want to give it up anyway

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
So why don't you get into some news Loki

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
He has unlocked me and the other two characters

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Anyways

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Fear II they had some pretty

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Interesting advertisement

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
For Fear II in the UK

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Actually they had trained

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Black cats that were

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Walking around and

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Advertising with Fear II little

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
T-shirts on it's cat-vertising

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
So

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It's pretty awesome actually and

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You know I didn't know you can

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Train cats so I think that's even more

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Amazing right there

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
You can train cats? Yeah but

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Cat shows really do tricks like dogs do

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
To be your minions of advertising?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I mean I'm surprised

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
But you know they didn't have their own agenda

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
But anyways

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
What's even cooler is if you happen to live

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
In the UK there's a number you can call to get your own

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Fear II cat shirt

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I totally okay

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
For our UK listeners somebody get me a shirt

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
For Shermy

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Yeah

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Make sure it's a 3XL cat size

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
And I'll

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Get a fat fucking cat

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I love my cat I know

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And I will put it on her and model her

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
With the fear shirt on

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
You could just probably get like a

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I don't know if you could

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I want an official fear shirt for my cat

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Oh

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Well I don't know who knows

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And then later on it's probably Dolphys sized

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Pose

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Oh sweet

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
See now we're just going to be distracted by Street Fighter

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
It's going to be terrible

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Apparently yeah it's um

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
If you live in London

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
During the next few days you know you might have

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Or seen you know

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
It was actually going on from mid-week to

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
About the Friday the 13th

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
You might have seen these cats walking around

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Catpartizing

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I think it's awesome I would put

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
One of these on my cat if she wouldn't you know claw

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Me to death but

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Biohaze20 in chat asks

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
My cat talks and smokes a lot of pot

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Is that eligible for cat shows?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I don't know that might get it disqualified

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Does the cat actually

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Smoke pot or do you blow

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Pot smoke in the cat's face?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
That would be for the stoned olympics

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Remember Eddie Isher talked

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
About the stoned olympics

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
What's that?

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I've not heard of this

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Well you're tested for drugs to make sure that you've taken enough

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I see

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Drugs are bad

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Drugs are very bad

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I think they're badass

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
What else is bad for you but Grand Theft Auto 4

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Is very very bad for you

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
But that doesn't stop many of you

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
The Lost and the Damned of course is coming out

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
This coming week

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
The 17th

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
A lot of people are going to be

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Very busy when that comes out

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
The hell with Street Fighter 4

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Good thing you were able to get Street Fighter 4 early

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
You're going to be ready to move on

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
This level is beautiful

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
What stage is this?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
This is the Midnight Jungle

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Anyhow

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
It's going to be like this for the whole second half of the show tonight

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
It's okay

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Grand Theft Auto 4

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Lost in the Damned

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Not only is it coming with

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Of course all the great

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Download content

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
A free week of multiplayer

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
From the 17th to the 22nd

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
It's called a Game with Rockstar event

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
You can play Lost in the Damned online

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
For free if you don't have Xbox Live Gold

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Although I'm surprised there's that many folks

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Out there that have this game and not have Xbox Live Gold

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
But I guess there's enough

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
There you go

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Yeah really you need it online anyways

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Because there's not much to do if you don't have it

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And you beat the game

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I don't know

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
It's weird though because even this game

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
When Saints Row 2 came out

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
I'm going to be playing Saints Row 2 a lot more than Grand Theft Auto 4

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Not the case

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
It's so weird

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I don't know

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Alright

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I'm going to have to interrupt here

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I know that Dark Sakura is dying to do

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
A story here

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
But I have an OLR special bulletin

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
If you will

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
I need the theme music

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
For when we have special bulletins

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I used to have a little trumpet announcement thing

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
We used to do

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
How about this Rob?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
What?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
That'll work

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
The new website is live

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
So check it out

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Orangelaunchradio.com

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And there it is

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Orangelaunchradio.com is up

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
So check it out

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
You know what that earns?

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
What?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
No in all reality though

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I'm actually loading it up right now

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
In all reality we want to say a big big big big big

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Thank you to

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Deakman

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And VXJsonXV

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
For their hard work on getting the new website up and running

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
What do you mean it isn't?

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
For everybody that put that together

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
It's amazing

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
It has a little space invader

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
As Tigerclaw says in chat

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
It's much easier on the eyes than the old site

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Well maybe there are some

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Splashes of other color

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
We're going to be adding light

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
When we add new stories

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
We can upload pictures

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Do reviews work?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
You can just add a review

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
It's a new story

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
So I have

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I know I'm going to miss the old photo too

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
And in other announcements JustinTV is still networking

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Alright so

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Thank you guys again very much

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And yay for that

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
So we'll talk more about the new website

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I am posting photographic proof

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Hold on hold on

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I forgot about that there's that little thing

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
The gallery

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
If you check this out there's a new gallery on Orangelaunchradio.com

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
And you can go into the OL army pics

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
And you can look at pictures that our people have uploaded

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Please don't abuse this

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
But Dark Soccer right now

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Is taking pictures of us playing Street Fighter 4

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Here in studio

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And she's going to upload them to

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
The OL army pics gallery

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
There's Dark Tetsuya with an old ass

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Pinball table

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
There's our messy floor

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Some people have been uploading random stuff

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Alright so Dark Soccer is working on that right now

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
It's like JustinTV but ghetto

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
So there you go

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Alright let's try and go back to

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Gaming news if we can

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Oh we're on

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Dark Soccer's turn

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And she's up and taking pictures

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Rezz

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Hi

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Rezz

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Rezz an 18 wheeler

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
What do these two games have in common?

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Sega re-registered the trademarks

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
For Rezz an 18 wheeler

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
American pro trucker

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
And they were Dreamcast titles as you might recall

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
But hey we've also got

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
The Rezz

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Remix thingamadookie right?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Thingamadookie

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Rezz HD Remix thingamadookie

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Yeah for MatchingService

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Dot com

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
But no we've uh

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So they've uh

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Renewed those so who knows

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
We may have

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
New truck in action with a

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Really poppy soundtrack

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Yeah that's what I'm hoping is that they actually combine

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
The two games and we get 18 wheeler

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Uh oh

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
It's Sakura vs. Dan on Street Fighter 4

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
So

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
This is

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Just going to bug us all night

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Why are you Sakura?

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Oh

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Anyhow

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Who knows what interesting games

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Could come of these remake trademarks

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
I don't know

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
This picture is going up because this is our

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Daily life at home

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Dan vs. Sakura

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
What's interesting though

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And this is kind of a rumor that's been around for a while now

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
In fact I remember another story about this

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
The Sega vintage collection

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Is rumored to be coming to

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Xbox Live Arcade

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
You may remember a while back

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
They had some screenshots of

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
The Sega vintage collection with like

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
The Sonic the Hedgehog games or something like that

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Well apparently this vintage

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Collection is supposed to be bringing

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Some of the old Genesis games to

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Xbox Live Arcade

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Some of these games you might expect

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Are Gunstar Heroes, Comic Zone

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Altered Beasts, Shinobi 3

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
And Sonic the Hedgehog 3

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Okay but

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
I just bought all of those games on the Mega Genesis

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Collection so what's the freaking point

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Gunstar Heroes not on it

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Okay one game

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
And I also

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I already bought Gunstar Hero because it was one of the first

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Virtual console games on the Wii

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I don't get it either but you know then again they also released

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Hedgehog and stuff by Stand Alone

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So maybe people

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Want just one game and

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
It just, I don't see the value in that

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And you know

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
I see Game Grumps says it's on PSN as well

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Maybe I have the

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Collection thingy on PS3 so

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
You know and sadly the only way that this would actually

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Work as far as being you know worthwhile

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Is if they had those like say 4 or 5

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Games and charged like maybe

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
5 or 10 bucks for it or something like that

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
And then having it kind of like a mini

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Version of that collection but at the same time

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
It's like what's the big deal, what's the point

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Cause you can just go purchase you know 40 games

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
For you know 30 bucks

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Or you can wait for the price drop and you'll get

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
40 games for 20 bucks

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I don't know

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I don't know either it's a little interesting

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
But it's a rumor right now it's coming from a

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Dutch gaming site but

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
It's kind of weird though that we see two of these same types

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Of rumors happening you know before

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
So I don't know

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
AcidicVampire in chat says achievement whores will

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Buy it that's true achievement whores

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Will definitely buy it

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Very very true

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Well

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Another fighting game going on

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Out there in the world not just street fighter

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
4 but how many of you guys

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Are fans of wrestlemania

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Nobody? Ok

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I used to be a fan of wrestlemania

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
But you miss the classics right

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
You miss the classic wrestlemania like Hulk Hogan

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And all those people well the good news is there's a

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Game coming out that's just for you

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
It's called Legends of Wrestlemania

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
And this game is actually

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Going to have wrestlemania greats

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
From like the 80's

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Including look at this screenshot Andre the Giant

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And Hulk Hogan

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
And it's going to be like a battle game

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Where you can fight all these people

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
And just to give you a sampling

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Of the 42 characters again this is a rumor

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
It's coming from NeoGaf

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Those forums but hey

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
You know what if you want to put together a hell of a

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Wrestlemania game this sounds like a good place to start

King Kong Bundy

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Million Dollar Man

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Mr. Fuji, Mr. Perfect, Rick Flair

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Sergeant Slaughter

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Stone Cold Steve Austin

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Just some awesome awesome

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Most of which are dead

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Sadly most of which are dead

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
SHJ100Matt says

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
I played this at Comic Con it's a lot of fun

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I wouldn't doubt it

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
That's an ultimate fighting game right there

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
That's going to be a lot of fun

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Even though I'm not a big wrestlemania fan

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I do remember the old school wrestlemania

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
On the NES that was like one of the first

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Fighting games ever

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
That had like six of those characters

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
In it I remember like Macho Man was in it

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And Hulk and Andre

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
There were like the Million Dollar Man

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Had a little dollar sign he had to get

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
That was a power up

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
There was just these dumb little things in it

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
That made it awesome

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
It's kind of cool that wrestlemania lasted all this time

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Didn't they just have their 25th anniversary

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Or something like that?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Which one?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Wrestlemania had like a 25th anniversary or something

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Just recently? I don't know they had something

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It was a big anniversary for it I know

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Anyhow I'm sure somebody in chat that's a big wrestling fan

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Will correct me momentarily

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
WWF Wrestlefest

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I thought it was Wrestlemania

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Wrestlemania is the big one I'm thinking of

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Well at any rate

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
How about some news from

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Squenix

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Squenix? Sure

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Well

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
At any rate

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
The

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Playstation 2 game

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Persona 4

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Is going to be out in the UK

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
On March 13th

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And the PAL box is going to have

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
A special CD

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Soundtrack

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
With 24 tracks

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
It has a new plot

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
New places to go

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
New stuff to look at

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
New things to kill

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
New spookies

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And it is the same stylized

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Manga pop culture art

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
To go in the game

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
So

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Go check it out for when it's out

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And actually it's supposed to be

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Not too far off

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
From the style of Persona 3

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
So

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Go for it

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
They're just using the same engine for Persona 3

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
If I remember right

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Just milking money out of it

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
But hey you know what actually

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
There's a lot of love out there for Persona 3

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And I haven't played it personally

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
But I hear it's very in depth

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
And it's pretty cool

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Very very cool

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Well you can check it out now

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
It's already out

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
In the US at least

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
At some point

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Alright so

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Some other cool stuff

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Well actually it isn't very cool

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
It's kind of typical for Nintendo

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
People trying to exploit them

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
For any sort of class action lawsuit

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
This time it's not really related

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
To wrist straps or throwing stuff through TVs

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Apparently

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
This guy Michael

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Tortilla

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Not Tortilla but Tortilla

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
He's a fitness expert

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
And apparently a host of some

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
AMTalk radio show called

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Shape Up America

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
And he has announced plans that he's gonna

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
File a class action lawsuit against Nintendo

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Claiming that they're injuring

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Or that people are getting injured

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Playing Wii games because

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Nintendo isn't telling people to properly

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Warm up before doing exercise

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
He claims that

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Wii Fit has led the people

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Sustaining injuries in their knees

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Back in risk because

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Overuse of improper warm up

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Just

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
I don't know I think this is kind of a stretch

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I mean that's just like saying

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Oh well you know

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I got up and walked down the stairs

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
But my TV didn't tell me to warm up

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Before I did activity

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
On top of that actually

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
This is something that people have been doing for years

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Before you do any physical activity

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
It's a good idea

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Even before stretching it's a good idea

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
To warm up your muscles

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Before you even stretch

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Or you're at risk for injury

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
In the tendons and tissue

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I mean that's just

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Should be common sense stuff that they teach you

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
When you're in school

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Well I think this is kind of pointless anyways because

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
The Wii games aren't necessarily

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
High impact I mean

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Wii sports tennis does not need

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
To be high impact it doesn't sense

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
You swing the

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Wii mote like a tennis racket

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
You know you don't have to do that

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
You just have to move your wrist I mean

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
That's not

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Their fault it's the fault of people playing it

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
That are getting way too into the game

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
And hurting themselves

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
GS68 in the chat room has a good point

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
At chat dot orange lounge radio dot com

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
He says DDR doesn't tell people to stretch either

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And it's been getting you know away with it

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
For so so long right?

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Yeah it just

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It shouldn't even be a thing it's a frivolous

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Lawsuit it's gonna get thrown out

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I agree and you know what frivolous lawsuits

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
I don't know about you guys but frivolous lawsuits

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Make me angry and uh

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
When we get angry here at orange lounge radio we cue

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
That nasty music and say some nasty things

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Music

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I have two FUs

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Um the first one being the internet

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Connection at my house

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Because of the damn wind

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Which this really isn't like

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Wind but unfortunately

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Sacramento has no idea

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
What to do when a tree moves

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
To be fair California in general

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Yeah

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
But I mean

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Plan for the fucking wind

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
We get wind storms here every so often

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
So just plan for it

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
And be prepared

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
For everything constant vigilance

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
And then um

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
My other FU goes

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Towards um

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Half dot com

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
The school book that I ordered

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
That still hasn't arrived

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
But um I will say that I don't think I got

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Charged for it so

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
I have to go find the damn thing again

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And I don't want to buy it from school

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Because school is fucking expensive

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I would rather

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Be frugal because I have

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Things that my money is better spent on

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
The end

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Um

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Loki do you have any FUs of the week?

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yeah FU to the rain because for the second

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Week now in a row it has ruined my

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Plans to go airsofting

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
And it's really pissing me off because

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I wanted to go like weeks ago now

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I have all the equipment all the ammo

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Everything I'm ready to go

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
And it keeps fucking raining and

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
It always rains like on the weekend

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
It's dry through the week and then it starts

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Raining and then wind and ugh

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
But so now this next

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Week I'm hoping to be able to go

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Airsofting it might actually have to be

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
That Saturday instead of Sunday morning

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Which is annoying but

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Actdeft in chat has a suggestion for you

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
He says blame it on the rain

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Yeah yeah

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Forget it

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Ah that's funny but right now

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Um I have a feeling

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Though it's gonna still be raining next week

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Fucking weather yeah sure it doesn't rain

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
All you know before this and now

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
All of a sudden it's just like oh rain rain rain

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Rain rain rain more rain

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Alright well my FU of the week

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Goes to having the worst Valentine's

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Day ever ever

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Because I was sick and I was having what you call

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Horizontal day that means I was lying on the couch

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
All day long so yeah made Valentine's

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Day kinda suck so

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
And I was just bored and lonely

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And sad so

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
You know I just wanted a hug is that so wrong

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But yeah Valentine's

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Day sucks but what is this just another day right

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Uh Dan do you have any FUs of the week real quick

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Just wanted to say FU to Ryu

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Keep kicking my ass

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
And that's about it

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Alright there you have it FU to Ryu

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Alright

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
That's gonna do it for the FUs of the week but let's get back into some gaming

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
News and guess what the lawsuit stories are

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Not over that's right uh

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Guess who got sued this time though it's almost

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
A twist of fate you know how like

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
There's this running inside joke that like

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Konami will sue like you know ever

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Since they sued Rockstar which I still think they

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Were in the right to sue them

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I agree they were totally in the right

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
But some of the lawsuits since then have been

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
A little interesting well now

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
The tables have gotten turned Konami

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Got sued this week yup

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
So now it's not Konami will sue it's

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Konami got sued uh Viacom

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And Harmonix sued

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Konami over the game

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Rock Revolution they say

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
That Rock Revolution violates their patents

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
For musical instrument peripherals

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
But wait a minute

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Um didn't Konami kind of

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Invent the well nevermind

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Anyhow uh the complaint was

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Filed this week in a federal court in

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Boston which is where Harmonix is based

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
The complaint wants to stop the sales of

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Rock Revolution and wants cash compensation

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Well please the sales were already

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Stopped I don't know I don't think you need it

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Done Matt done there you go

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
You win congrats

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Um I don't know

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
But I guess well more so they probably want

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Cash for it and they probably want

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Uh I don't know some type of

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Uh I would say you know

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
It's sad to say I would say that Rock Revolution

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Impacted the sale

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Of Rock Band in no way whatsoever

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I know for real right

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I can't say I can't honestly say there has been

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
One person on the face of the earth that said

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Ooh Rock Revolution that's way better than

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Rock Band

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
But this is so strange apparently

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Even though the Viacom patent um

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Says that it improved on earlier

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Video game music controllers and even kind of references

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Beatmania uh

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
They're still but this is the weird thing

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
About it Konami didn't put out

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
A new guitar with this game

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
They put out a new drum set

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Which probably sold five of them

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Unless the internals of the drum set are you know

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Something similar to what's you know

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Put out there but their drum set

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Looked like their old drum set for Drummania

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
I mean it

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Looked like crap and it

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Apparently played like crap so I don't understand

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I don't know

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Other than maybe it's like well fine you

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Sue us but we're gonna sue you back

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
We'll sue you too

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
SSJ100 Matt

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
SSJ100 Matt in chat says uh

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Aaron or YYR takes pride

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That Snake 360 has outsold

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Rock Revolution

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
That's probably a true fact I wouldn't doubt that at all

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I wouldn't doubt it

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
He does have gut mechanics

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
We got um Rufus

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Rufus now fighting by the way they're saying

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Justin TV's back up you might want to try to connect one more time

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
On the thing then the folks can see this

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
And at least the live listeners

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Will get to understand what we're talking about

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Even if the podcast listeners are screwed

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Nope still not working

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
No that's a bummer

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Alright well anyhow

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yeah it'll be interesting to see how this one

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Turns out I wonder if they'll settle I wonder if

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Somebody's just trying to make a point I have no

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Idea yeah frisbee in our chat room sums it up

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Lawsuit ping pong that's

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Exactly what appears to be happening here

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
I cannot see

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
There's no case here I mean it's just

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
You know it didn't affect

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Their sales at all I mean

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
It really the sales of rock revolution

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Were so friggin poor

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
That I don't see how they can say

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Oh well our sales were impacted

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
You know if it's guitar hero rock band

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Maybe there's you know something there but

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And I know it seems like we're always

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Siding with Konami on this show but

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
You know don't take that too

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Much because honestly we're just saying

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
That having to put your name on

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Rock revolution was punishment enough

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I mean it's not good

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
You know financial

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Liability I don't think

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Is warranted but what do I know I'm not a judge

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I mean I can say maybe that

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
They I don't think they

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Do they have vocals in rock revolution

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I don't think they did I don't think they're the

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Actual songs I think they're

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Oh yeah no you don't sing along I think it's

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
All cover bands

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
So

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Hell I don't know

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Whatever it's what the point it's what's the

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Point the game yeah

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Something like that well here's something that our

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
World of warcraft listeners will be more interested in

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Yay

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Have you actually gone back to play

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Not yet but what you're about to tell us might

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I'm very proud of you

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Oh my god it's still moving

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Sorry I'm very proud of you

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
If you've resisted the urge

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
I have it's been like three weeks now

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Ooh tap that vein

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Well

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
There's more about the dual talent

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Stuff in case

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
You were interested

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Um you know the dual talent

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Spec system is coming out in the game

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Um

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
And it's going to have

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
It to where you can switch

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Your characters between your

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Customization setups

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
One for rating one for pvp

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
And possibly one you know

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Between you know one for healing and one for

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
For damaging

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Um the option is only going to be available

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Um

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
If once you have hit

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Level 80 first

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And um

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Basically the reason

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Is um according to

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Greg Street who is uh

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Ghostcrawler

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
That they didn't want to make the game more complex

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
For lower levels who are still trying to learn

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Their class

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Um but there

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
He said if it proves popular then they will

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Consider expanding it

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
She'll basically pay a one time fee

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Um to your in game

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Class trainer

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
To access your dual specs and after

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
That you can switch between

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Um the two at any lexicon

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Of power in any city

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Um

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Also if you

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Have the inscription profession

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
You can sell portable lexicon

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Of power that will require

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
A group of players to summon and use

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Anywhere but during combat

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Or in arena

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
So nice

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
So you can switch roles in the middle

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Of a raid

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Basically like if you need

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
For instance I'm thinking in Naxxramas

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
You can get through most of the um

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Event with just two healers but it's really

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Nice to have a third healer

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
For four horsemen so just imagine

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Before you engage four horsemen okay let's summon

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
The lexicon of power and we're going to have our druid

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Switch from uh Boomkin to resto I mean that's

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
That's going to be a that's going to change

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
The dynamics big time

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Well with the specs themselves

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
You'll get um the dual setup

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
With your action bars and your glyphs

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
That will just switch automatically

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
When you change over to the other spec

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Um

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
There will also be a gear manager

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
That will allow you to change between

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Your equippable items

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Um for or you know

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Whether they be individual

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Or entire equipment sets

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Between the two specs

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
So

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
So it's it seems pretty complex

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Um

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
But they're actually saying that it's

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Going to be on the public test server soon

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
But not immediately

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Available um

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
And that the gear it they said though

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
That it would be starting off with

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Possibly the next content patch

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
But the gear manager is not going to be

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Um at the same time it'll fall later

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Yeah it'll probably

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
It'll probably be a little while before we actually see this

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Go into the game but I think they're doing the

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Star patch is what 3.1

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
And so that's probably when we'll start seeing

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Dual specing but the gear thing will probably

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Be a little while so

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
There you go and uh

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
The chat

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
The chat is uh making fun

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Of me for knowing exactly all this

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
WoW talk and all that

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
I was sitting here wondering if you were speaking another language

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Oh shut up

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Somewhere out there there are listeners of this

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Program that play WoW that understand perfectly

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Well what I just said

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
There are some people who quit

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Who understand what you're talking about

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
There you go there you go

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Alright so then we better talk about another gamer

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
I'm going to get right back on the WoW bandwagon

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Luckily I have Street Fighter 4

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
To ogle over and Dan is right now on the last boss

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Seth who looks like um

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
He looks like the glowing guy

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
From the Watchmen trailers to me

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
That's what he looks like

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Uh yeah and he's a cheap bastard

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
That has like the um specials

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
From a whole bunch of different characters

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Um I don't know

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
This is not Doral

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Thank you Tigerclaw

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Doctor Manhattan that's what I was trying to think of

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
He looks like Doctor Manhattan to me

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
He also has very um

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Abnormal muscles

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
In a true anatomical sense

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
He ate a spinning ying yang

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
No no no no I'm talking about

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
He has got like um

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Going down from a solar plexus

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
In between his ribs

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
To between his major abdominals

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
He's got a whole ridge of like

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Bonus muscles

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
That don't exist

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Sorry I noticed this stuff

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I'm just messing

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Alright sorry Loki

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
He's got extra muscles in his ass

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Anyways

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
There's a game coming out on

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
PC and

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
In April and possibly

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Well in the PS3 I guess in

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Quarter 3 this year

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Free Realms it's a free mmo RPG

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
And it's uh I guess

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Kinda geared towards kids

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And uh you will be able to play it for free

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
On the Playstation Network

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Um whenever that happens to come out

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
So that's kinda neat

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
And it's um I guess

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I don't know if it's gonna be I'm assuming

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
It's one of those free to play but you have to

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Pay for upgrade type you know things

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
But uh hey free's good I guess

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
It doesn't look that bad

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000
But I don't know I haven't really played it

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Well okay then

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Well Street Fighter 4

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Mania is sweeping not just

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
The US but Japan and

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
When do I say Mania I mean

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Mania 86,000

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Copies sold in the first day alone

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
In Japan and if that doesn't

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Sound like a lot of copies you need to

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Understand this they are sold out in

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Japan you can't find this game in Japan right now

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
86,000 was the first pressing

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And uh it's gone

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Uh apparently they are gonna try and crank some more

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Of these guys out as fast as they can but uh

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Right now they're like Nintendo Wii's

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Trying to find these guys

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Not easy I wonder if the same thing

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Is gonna happen over here in the US I don't think fighting games

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Are as big here but I

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Definitely think this is the type of thing that you're probably

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Gonna be hoping you had a pre-order for

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Or you're gonna have to run to Best Buy when they open or

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
The stores that don't do actually even Best Buy does pre-orders now

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Huh who doesn't do pre-orders

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Circuit City well look what happened to them

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Kmart doesn't do pre-orders so you'll have to run

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
To Kmart at noon that's true if you ever want to get

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
A game on launch day go to Kmart because no one

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Shops at Kmart if you remember the old

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Orange launch radio piece of advice

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
No one shops at Kmart

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Actually I shop at Kmart now

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
You know why? Because the target

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Right over here by the house

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Is closed for remodeling till October

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
They're turning into an Uber

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Target or whatever

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Yeah I think it's turning into a Greatland

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
So the target is closed

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
For the foreseeable future

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
And I will not go to Walmart

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
So and

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
The other target Greatland is kind of a ways away

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Why won't you go to Walmart? I'll just go to

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Because it's dirty in its ghetto

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Well that's because it's the Rancho Cambodia

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Walmart because it makes you hate humanity

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
For real

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
So I would rather go to Kmart honestly

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
So there you go

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
How's that for some rule reversal?

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Misty says hey I shop at Kmart right after Christmas

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Got some cute jeans

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
There you go

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
They came from the 80s?

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Are the jeans bedazzled

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
In the back

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
That type of 80s style

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
No they're stonewashed

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Rob

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
They're acid washed

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Nice

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Alright

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Can we move on?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Why am I actually explaining

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
The difference between Target and Target Greatland

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Greatland has more shopping

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I'm not even being paid

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
More grocery shopping

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Not a full grocery store

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
It's like a Super Walmart without being awesome

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Without the produce and without the beef

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Anyhow sorry

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I'm done with Street Fighter IV

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Did you want to talk about the next game Dark Sakura?

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Well

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
How about some Star Trek Online

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
How about it?

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
We were talking about the character trailer last week

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
And it's pretty

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
They're saying the O.L.Aureans

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
The official alien race

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Of Orange Dodge Radio and yes

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
They are orange

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Well maybe

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
But they're actually saying

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
There will not

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Be

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Any famous

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Star Trek personas

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Available in Star Trek Online

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
They're basically saying

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
It's in the future where the majority of the

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Known characters have passed

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
On except for the ones that are robots

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Holograms, ghosts

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Etc, etc

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Or Spock

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So we could see data?

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
No he died

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Oh that's right

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Damn it

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I don't remember

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Ok trackies help me out

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
What happened to Lure?

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I think he got disassembled

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
There's always more of them

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I want Q

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
I want there to be a freaking Q mission

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
And I want a Q mission

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Ok

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
However they have actually

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Been talking to

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Some

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Other folks

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
And

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
They don't really

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I don't think they've ruled it out

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Cryptocast hasn't ruled it out

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
It's not likely

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Although who knows what might happen

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
With those transporter accidents

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Oh Dan's

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Bringing out the big guns

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Dan is still trying to fight the last boss

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Of the game and is having trouble

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
He's a cheap bitch

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
It's why he can't beat him

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
It's massive jaw

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Did Seth suck you in

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
His stomach and then shoot you out?

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Because that's what it looked like in that one part

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
That's disgusting

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
It's massive jaw

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Versus person with

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Who's been taking too much collodial silver

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
You know that turned you blue for real

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Wow

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
You're a chemistry nerd

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I'm not I just happen to know that because

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I have an odd interest in skin diseases

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Right we're going to get to the mailbag here soon

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
But a couple more stories for you first

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Well guess what there's a new artist coming to

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Rock band

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Is it someone good?

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
No it's not Miley Cyrus

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Danny Minogue

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It's Snoop Dogg

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Just when I think of

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Rock band I think of Snoop Dogg

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Yes Snoop Dogg

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
He is coming to Rock band

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Download content

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
No word on what

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Songs they're actually going to put in Rock band

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
But I don't know many of them

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
That are rock-ish

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I don't know

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Who cares let's just play Gin and Juice

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Act deaf says

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Faux shizzle

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
You want to go riding with the homies

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Wasn't that Coolio?

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Coolio is rolling with the homies

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Coolioer

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Sorry

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Please tell me there's some other bands

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
That make more sense for Rock band

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Yeah there's some other stuff coming too

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
White Zombie

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Which makes me happy

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
There's two songs from White Zombie

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Black Sunshine and More Human Than Human

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
More Human Than Human

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
I love that song

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Wasted Again by Turbo Negro

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Those are coming this week to

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Rock band

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
The only bad thing about White Zombie is they really make me want to break things

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Like when I listen to their music

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Don't you want to break stuff?

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
No but

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Going back to the whole

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Hip-Hop artists being in Rock band

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
There was actually a remix of

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Some

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Not Tupac

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Some actual

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Puff Daddy song

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
I think that was

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
They did a Rock version of

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
That would be pretty

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Fit for Rock band although I think it's kind of old

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I remember seeing this back when I was playing

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Qzar

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Years ago

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
You know what song I'm surprised they haven't put in there?

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Is the Public Enemy Anthrax

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Bring the Noise

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Where is that?

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Or I was going to suggest

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
The Run DMC in Aerosmith

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
But that was actually in the Aerosmith

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Guitar Hero wasn't it?

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
That was in Guitar Hero Aerosmith

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
We need actual rocking out

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
We need Anthrax

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Anthrax and Public Enemy

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I still say we need GWAR

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
We need GWAR

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
GWAR

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
We need Rock band GWAR

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Or Rob Zombie

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I'd be good with Rob Zombie even though White Zombie

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
They have some Rob Zombie

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Anyhow

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Let's do some more news

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
I have one more story here

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
It's about G.I. Joe

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Naturally they're making a game

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Out of the new movie

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Which I'm sure a lot of folks saw

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
It's coming out soon

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
EA was actually showing off the game

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
At the little convention that was going on

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Apparently MTV blog

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Actually interviewed

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
The folks behind the G.I. Joe game and found out

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Knowing is half the battle

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
PSAs

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
They're going to be in the game

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
If you do well as you play the G.I. Joe game

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
You will unlock vintage

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Educational clips

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Where G.I. Joe comes out and does

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
This little spiel and says

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
And now you know and knowing is half the battle

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
So that's pretty amazing

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
So awesome

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Now you have a reason to get this

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
If you don't have them all

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
On Beta Max tape or something like that

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I don't know

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Anyhow let's take a minute

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
To open up the old mail bag

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And see what you guys have to say

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Every week you guys email us

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
At mailbagorangelaunchradio.com

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
We rip open the email bag

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
And see what you guys have to say

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Nothing no mail

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
That's a lie I saw at least three in there earlier

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
There's three

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Sup lords of O.L.R

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
As you maybe know

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
I listened and wrote this

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Misg

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
On my iTouch

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Last Sunday I wept because

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I tried to listen live on allgames.com

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
But it didn't work

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
FOUNTY FACE

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
How can you guys broadcast live to iTouch

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
And hell even PSP listeners

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Other than that I told you I got

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Endwar last week

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
And beat it in five hours and lied to Blockbuster

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
About it being broken

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
LOL I'm just cheap like that

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
The game was basically Company of Heroes

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
On the PC with mic support

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Which was state of the art

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
And worked

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
My brother just picked up four kickass games today

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Random capitalization

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
And this weekend is gonna kickass too

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
The games were

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Gears of War 2, GTA 4,

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Rainbow Six, Vegas 2, and Lost Planet

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I've got an ass ton

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Of games to play

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
I'll tell you what I thought of them next time

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Until the next email you hear from me

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Goodbye

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
This is from RJ

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Um

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I am gonna say this

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Given how much texting I do

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
On my iPhone

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
It is possible to

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Capitalize and use proper grammar

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
And spell shit correctly

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Especially when it fixes it for you

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Other than that

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Really the only way

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
To really listen to the podcast

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Through your

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
iPod or iPhone

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Is gonna be

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
To download the

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Podcast

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
We don't have it available live

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
And the PSP is the

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I thought we had a live player on PSP

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
We do, you have to be on

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
The PSP to see it though

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
So yeah

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
You gotta

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Next email

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Um

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Rini here

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
With greetings to the three hosts

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
And Ferret

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
He says hello as well

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I'd like to

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Take this particular email to hype a game

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
It's not necessarily

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
About the gameplay itself but more the

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Experience

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
I initially meant this towards Sky and Dark Sakura

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Loki may not get it

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
But he may be mildly amused

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
But I thought oh well let's get your listeners in this

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Before I say the name of the game

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I'd like to ask for any chat room listeners

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Who have played it to not spoil

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Anything about the game

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I guess that was in caps so I screamed it

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Thank you

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
The name of the game is Aversion

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
To compel everyone to play this simple

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Game here are a few reasons

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's free and played on your PC

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
With low system requirements

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
It's two hours

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
It's a platformer but it's not very hard

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
And lastly it's cute with a secret

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Oooh Navy Seals

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
And again it's meant to be

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
An experience

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
And worth it for the true ending

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
And there are two endings

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Here's the link for everyone

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Hold on

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Rob

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Sorry

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I'm dying here

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
And

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
They're doing other things

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
He's

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
He's working on Disney TV

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Because it says it's working but it's not working

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
It's the

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Phantom working

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
See Seth

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Is a cheap bastard

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
You know

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
The first round you can hand him

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
He's like oh I suck

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
And then the second round he's like eh you're dead

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
And they're like well you might win

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Aw

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
See that's why you have to switch it to one round

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Per battle and then

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
The first round he was like

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
I can't even fight

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
I'm like yeah

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Alright

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Extra credit to Sky

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
If he'll make a video of himself playing the game blind

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Never playing it before

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Not literally blind

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Now I'm going to poke his eyes out

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
With audio commentary and uploading it to the neglected

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
OLR YouTube channel

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Just saying

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Although it's not worth it if someone doesn't

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Make sense of the proper reaction

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
And a random question

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Will OLR support the DSI with podcasts

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
In AAC format

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
For those too lazy to

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Lazy to confront them from MP3

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
I'll give you the generic answer

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Maybe

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Thank you for your response

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
You're welcome for your response

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
This email brought to you by the Mirror Room from Silent Hill 3

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
With a weird

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Scrunchy face

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Last email

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Mike

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
In Australia again

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Hey

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Just wanted to say thank you to Rob

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
And All In Chat a fortnight ago

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
That recommended Chrono Trigger

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Although it's not a game I generally

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Would play I got the game on

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Rob's and the OLR's recommendation

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
And have been really enjoying it

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Might have to try Super Metroid if Rob picked it as

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
The number one game above Chrono Trigger

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Hey

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
If there's

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
If there's any

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Other DS games you can recommend

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Regardless of type of game

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I would like to hear your suggestions

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Hope everyone in the OLR world

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Is doing well and look forward to getting the podcast

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Updated soon. Thanks Mike

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Um

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Well I know I've

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Said this is Castlevania Order

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Of Ecclesia is a lot of

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Fun

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
I do really like Cooking Mama

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Um

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
There is

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Of course the western

Release Elite Beat agents you can maybe

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Find Osutetaki, Oendan

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Or Oendan 2

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
From Japan

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Um

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
There's a number of good RPGs out though

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
I mean there's just a bunch of really good

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Games out there

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Um

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
But I do um

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I do totally recommend

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Order of Ecclesia I mean if you really want to know

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
What I'm playing

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I'm grabbing my DS case

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Right now while Rob

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Is fixing Justin TV and I'll let you

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Know what the hell's in it right now

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Let me grab this

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Monstrosity of a case

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Right there

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Uh which of course half of them fell down and

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Sorry if you hear the random noises

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
I'm trying to fix Justin TV I'm not having much luck

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Though

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I think I just lost a game in your couch Rob

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
I think us trying to upgrade

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
The encoder thing

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Woo hoo! Dan finally did it

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Broke Justin TV so I don't know

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
With Dan! Dan beat Seth with Dan

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Nice

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And of course right as

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Dan beats the game

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
With Dan

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I can't get stupid Justin TV to work

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I'm pissed

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
If I meet someone named Seth I'm just gonna punch him in the face

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Oh I think I know why

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Because

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Well anyway the games that are currently in

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
My um case at this point in time

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Um and then maybe this will

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Give you an idea

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Yes

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Oh Dan's got a fun ending with Blanca

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Aka Jimmy and

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Sakura and Ryu

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And um

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Oh my god spoilers

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
So the games in my case right now are Final Fantasy 6

Top Trumps from um

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
The UK which given that you're in Australia

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I'm sure that you won't have a problem

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Getting that so that's what's currently

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
In my uh

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
System right now

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
So maybe that'll give you some ideas

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Um by the way

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I want to go back since I was futzing with Justin

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
TV I wanted to kind of correct one thing one listener

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Was saying and that was about um being able to listen

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
To Orange Lawn's radio on your iPhone

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Oh here's the other game

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
You actually can listen live you have to use an app like

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Tuner um tuner is what I use that's a pay

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
App but I know there's a free one as well

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Out there that you can use to tune in to like

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
All games radio when we're live on Sunday night

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
So you can listen on the phone iPhone

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Just like you can on the PSP I just wanted to uh

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Correct that uh the other game that's in here

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
The one that I lost to your couch

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Yes the world ends with you

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Oh you don't want to lose I mean you do want to lose that one

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
On my couch no I don't Rob

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Woohoo

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Alright

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
So anywho I'm just looking at the new website

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
The OL Army Picks and I finally see the

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Asakura vs Dan that's not the greatest quality

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Though if Justin TV stays down

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
We'll try to make a YouTube after the show

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Um of like a

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Ten minute review of Street Fighter IV

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Maybe that can be a fun thing we can do

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
I don't know Loki's trying to work like mad to get Justin TV back up

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
We'll see what happens

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Anyhow meanwhile if that does it for the mailbag

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
I'm going to say send us more mail

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Also if I'm not over

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
This by next week someone else is reading

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Mailbag

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Alright we'll see I can always do that I guess

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
If my cold goes away

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Loki uh we've got some couple more news stories

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
And we're going to open up the skype line at

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
2007 game OLR not just yet almost there

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Couple more news stories for you guys

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Yeah

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Um anyways

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
So there's um an interesting

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Lawsuit taking place here

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Or about to take place

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Apparently Activision is threatening

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
EA with a lawsuit over

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Brutal Legends

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
And Activision is saying that

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Um

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Basically that you know even though they

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Abandoned the publishing rights

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
You know

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
That somehow they're you know do some money

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
It doesn't make any sense actually

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
If you think about it but um

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Apparently

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
You know uh you know after the merger

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
With Vinvidi because they were originally going to

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Purchase or publish Brutal Legends

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Um you know Activision didn't

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Bring it on because they wanted to keep their core franchises

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Like Spyro

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
And Crash

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
God

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Anyways stuff that they can make you know multiple

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Um releases for

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Well EA picked it up and now you know

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Activision wants money

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
So I don't get how that's possible

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
But okay

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Um and it's actually funny because um

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
EA had put out a comment too about it

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
As well

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Regarding the whole Brutal Legends

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Thing they um attributed

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
To it's like um

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
You know we doubt Activision would try

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
To sue that would be like a husband

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Abandoning his family and then suing

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
After his wife meets a better looking guy

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
That's the most awesome

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Comparison I've ever heard but I mean it makes

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
You know what they're saying makes sense it's kind of like

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Well you guys didn't want to put out this game so

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
We're giving them an outlet and now you're saying

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
No you can't do it

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
It's weird

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I mean they want money

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
They do but then why won't they just put out the game

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Because they're afraid of

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Someone else making money I don't it's weird

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
The whole thing's weird

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Yeah basically saying that they were still in talks with

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Them about putting out the game

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Well too bad or is that

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
One of the things that's like oh well shit

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
If it's going to be such a big deal maybe we should

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Put out this game after all

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Well yeah exactly it's like

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Oh well we were in talks you know but

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
That's like saying you know I was about to buy

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
A car and some guy you know I've been dicking

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Around oh I'm looking around at some other

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Things I may buy that car I'll let

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
You know and then some guy comes in and buys a car

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I'm not going to go sue the guy because

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
He bought my car if you

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Stop dicking around for it you know and you

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Didn't think that you thought that Spyro

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Would do a lot better than this

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Which I can tell you right now when they

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Made that announcement originally I was like

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Are you fucking kidding me that they're going to drop

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Ghostbusters and

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
You know Brutal Legend because they want

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Spyro and Crash

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
What?

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
So in other words stop dicking around Activision

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Stop being retarded

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
You know what big fucking whoop

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Oh no now you can't sell Brutal Legend

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
You know what it's not going to break you

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
You've got like 50,000 Guitar Hero

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Games coming out you've got Call of Duty

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
What's your problem you have plenty

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Of IPs that are coming out that are going to be

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Successful just get over it

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Alright our old buddy Bobby wants to make a point here

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Activision doesn't want to publish it but they want the money for it

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Like they got from Atari for Ghostbusters and Riddick

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Yeah Atari paid Activision

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
For the rights to publish the game

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
EA is not paying Activision to publish Brutal Legend

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
EA is not that beat down yet

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
It'll be interesting to see what comes of this

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
We'll see

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Sadly the person that's going to get hurt here

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
The folks behind Brutal Legend

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Including the same gentleman who is responsible for Psychonauts

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Bummer

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
It'll get published

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Eventually

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
It was never going to be a big hit

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
I hate to tell you this it's a

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
It's a niche-y title

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
It's not going to sell a gajillion copies

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Of Activision passed on it

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
But I mean

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
The thing is you got to go

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
You got to go with the

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Safe titles

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
And then you got to go with the titles that are

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Going to get you some acclaim

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
And EA is kind of learning that

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Because they went from doing

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
All the safe bets

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
All the time and everybody was like

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Fuck EA

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Their games are horrible

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I mean what else can they spew out of

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And crap and then they started bringing out

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
All these great games like

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Dead Space and Mirrors Edge

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
And

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
These games that have kind of more

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Limited audiences but

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
You know they're getting EA some

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Recognition as hey

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I remember when EA could make a game

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
I freaking sold a copy

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Of Mirrors Edge last week practically

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I remember Matt was here last week

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
We played the demo after the show and he totally

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Was like oh I got to get this game this is awesome

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
I was like I sold a copy of Mirrors Edge

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Where's my sales money

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
It's a fantastic game and

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
You know they're going to build new

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Franchises and Activision sold

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Their future franchises

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
For old tired franchises

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
That

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Aren't with the developers that made them famous

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Anymore and are pieces of

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Crap you know Crash

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Is done I mean yeah

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Every Crash game is going to sell

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
250,000 copies

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Consistent the kids know the brand

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
I sold a Crash game the other day

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
It hurt my heart but you know

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Crash of the titans

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Boy that's family entertainment

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
You know but you look at like

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
This Ghostbusters game which has had

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
Screenshots out for like what a year

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I have demo discs saying that I could get it last

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
October it looked great

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Then and

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Atari I think is going to have a

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Hit on their hands that they need and

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Maybe they can break out of that

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
You know yeah we make Dragon Ball Z

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
And it keeps us in business

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
That they've been in for the last few years

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Yeah

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Black Wolf brings up a good point it still has the

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Ghostbusters lanyards from PAX

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
All of us that went to Penny Arcade Expo are lanyards

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Were Ghostbusters games

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
That was like the day before they pulled the plug on it

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
You know and really Activision

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Just for whatever reason they sent out the nicest

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Little Ghostbusters pre-sell

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Kit it came with an Ecto-1

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
License plate that I shanked

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
It came with Ghostbusters lanyards

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
A demo disc a t-shirt

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I mean it was a nice little kit and the box

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Looked like a trap

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
And it had like goo

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Oozing out and it says do not open until

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
October 2008

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
It was pretty sick you know you gotta wonder

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
It's just like why put all that energy into it and then just be like

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Oh yeah we got Blizzard on our side now

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
F this game

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
I mean Activision published Ghostbusters

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Back in the day for the NES

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
And the Sega and the Commodore

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
And they figured it would be you know poetic

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
That they're gonna carry it on

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
No not so much

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
We're gonna just let it go

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
It's kinda weird

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
It'll sell it'll be just like

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Psychonauts where it'll be that game

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Nobody buys when it comes out except for the enlightened few

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
The unwashed masses

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Don't understand it won't get it

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
And then it'll be expensive on the secondary market

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
As somebody who wants to be newly hardcore

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Figures out that it's out there

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
And has to get their hands on it

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
You know

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
It'll be one of those titles

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Alright

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Well we got one more news story for you guys

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
And we're gonna open up the skype line

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Take some quick calls at 1877 game OLR

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
username on skype orange lounge radio

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
And it's about the Beatles game that's coming out later this year

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
This

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
It's not Rock Band Beatles

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
It's just the Beatles that will probably look a lot like

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Rock Band

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Well finally we have some insight as to what this game might be like

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
It's from an interview with Entertainment Weekly

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
It's Paul McCartney

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Actually has talked about the Beatles music game

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Saying 45 Beatles songs will be in this game

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
From different periods of the Beatles histories

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Including early days tracks

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Liverpool, Psychedelic

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
And on from there

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Because you know McCartney really knows what this game is all about

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
He's probably right down there

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
With the dev team jamming out on the plastic guitar

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
You know what though

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
He probably has him and George Harrison

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Probably have control and Yoko

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Has control over everything

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Oh they got mad control

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I mean this game like every pixel that goes out on this game

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Has to be signed off by Yoko Ono

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Yeah they got mad control

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I'm sure these are gonna give you you know

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Deep compelling you know gameplay tidbits

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
You know what though this could be

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
This could be pretty awesome

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I mean the Beatles

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Oh this is necessary

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
This is so necessary

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Next to Rock Band Journey

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
This is the most important title they could possibly do

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Nope

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
I made a bad faux pas George is the one that's dead

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I meant Ringo Starr not George Harrison

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
George Harrison has control from hell

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Ringo's got nothing

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
And actually it's you know

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Yoko

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Yoko's got all the power

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
McCartney's got all the money

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
And Ringo's like I was a Beatle once

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Sorry about that

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
That's alright

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Your British accent is probably better than mine

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
But anyway yeah

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
This is a game that's very very necessary

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Because like what

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
There hasn't been a big

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Beatles thing for this generation

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
You know what I mean

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
These kids today

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Don't have anything to respect the Beatles with

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
If that makes any sense

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Well I had a conversation the other day

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
With actually a couple people

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
And over the course of like two weeks

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I talked to two people about

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
What do the Beatles mean anymore

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And obviously

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
We're all old enough

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
With probably the exception of my lovely wife

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Who's you know a young

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
We're all old enough

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Just giving you some credit there

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
She's 26 doesn't look a day over 22

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Old enough to realize that

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
The Beatles mean something

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
It's not that we were

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Listening to the Beatles

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Avidly you know when we got into

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Whatever was our popular music

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
But you know we knew that the Beatles

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Were super important to our parents

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
They were super important to music

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
And everybody we listened to would claim the Beatles as an influence

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Right it trickled down

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
And we knew that the Beatles were important

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
What do today's

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Music listeners

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Today's 14 year old what do they know about the Beatles

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Pretty much what they hear from the older

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Generation or just that

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
There's the fashion fad going around again

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
You know they have the

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
You know merchandising happening again

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
I mean but really

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
They

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
This is one thing that I'd actually like to consider

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Is that our time we don't really know

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
War

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
On the scale of what was going on

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
During that time listen to me

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
We don't know war of that type

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
We don't have people being

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Drafted and forced to go into a war

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
That they don't believe in

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
We don't have

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
You know being stuck in such

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
And true we do have

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
The religious right trying to

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Keep us in that phase

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
But we're going from a time of completely

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Stodgy

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Everyone's the same into complete

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Individualism and the you know

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
A massive revolution

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
We're not talking the message

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
We're talking the music and the band

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
The music is the message

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Just strictly

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
What do kids today know about

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
The Beatles and I'm not trying to diss on the Beatles

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
I'm not trying to diss on today's kids

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I'm really just trying to make the

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Point that they're not really

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
So much into

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
The Beatles I mean it's

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Definitely an example of gaming skewer towards

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Skewing towards the older demographic but

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
It's like yeah it's gonna bust

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
You know maybe some younger

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Players some Rockman players into the Beatles

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
But I mean this is a huge deal

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
I mean everyone's making the fucking

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
World of how important this is

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
You can't even get the Beatles on iTunes

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Cause the control over the library is that tight

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
But what is this really gonna mean to your

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Average guitar hero Rockman player

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
You can't get it on iTunes

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Because of the big spat between

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Apple computer and Apple

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Core

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
But you know

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
I don't think it's gonna matter cause I think everybody's

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Parents are gonna buy it I think all these kids

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
I think the parents are all gonna

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Buy this stuff up and even some of the kids

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Although I gotta say though a lot of you know

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
You said earlier a lot of the bands we

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Grew up on were influenced by the Beatles

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
A lot of these bands today I hear in

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Interviews I've heard a lot of them say they were influenced by

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
David Bowie this is not a bad thing at all

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
So

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Yeah I'm just you know

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
I'm looking forward to

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Rockman the Beatles or whatever it's gonna be

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Except for the fact that

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
They're probably gonna screw us and won't let us

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Import the music into Rockman 2

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
But I mean come on you know you wanna do it

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Like the ACDC that would be the only thing

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
That made it worth buying is the fact that

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I could just dump it all into Rockman you know

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
And add to this stupidly awesome playlist already

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
But I wanna see

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
You know from the standpoint of

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Of someone who works

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
In the absolute bowels of the

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Industry I wanna see

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
How this game's gonna sell when it gets to stores

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Cause there's not really any buzz about it

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I don't have people standing in line to

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Reserve the Beatles I don't have people standing in line to

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Reserve even Guitar Hero Metallica

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I think the Guitar Hero fad is kinda starting to die

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Um and I

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Like I said earlier in the show you know

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
How to run a franchise into the ground I think that

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I think they're barking up the wrong tree

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I think this is gonna be the last

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Ah out there is this Beatles game

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
And then it's gonna be all downhill from there

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I think this is gonna be the last hurrah

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Well I just think it's actually

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Pretty sad that

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
With the current generation

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Is starting to lose relevance

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I mean it's

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Hideous but

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I mean I understand it but

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
I still think it's horrible

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Who influenced the Beatles?

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
See that's the thing is it's just the passage

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Of time we don't know why they

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Became what they became you know

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Um and

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I influenced the Beatles

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Drugs influenced the Beatles

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
What bands did the Beatles listen to?

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I mean I know we could go on the internet and look it up

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
And find out but I mean you know it doesn't have

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
The relevance because it's not

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
It's not as important anymore

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
You know we know that all the great bands

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
That we listen to listen to the Beatles when they were growing

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Up and so we're like man the Beatles must kick ass

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
What did the Beatles listen to?

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
The answer is who cares?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
It's too far back for a story about your average

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
15 year old player ain't worried about

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
The Beatles hell Guitar Hero Metallica

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Like I said is not really making as big

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
A deal as I think they need to come up with

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Something newer and popular

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
And topical that's

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Gonna get you know the dollars

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Out of the pockets and

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
So far it's like really I think

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
All of the track packs the

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Band editions whatever

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Have been sort of

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Sort of fail

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Couple comments from chatroom I gotta read

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Chat.orangelandrater.com Black Wolf says

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
I don't want it to be something that I can say hey

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
I wish I could just import these into rock band

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
I hope it's different enough to see it on its own

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Merits rather than just another track pack

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Sure and that's cool

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
But once you're in a party setting

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
And you wanna play

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Some Beatles and then you wanna play

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
You know some Casey and the fucking

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Sunshine band and you wanna play

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Some Metallica and you wanna play some

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Who and you wanna play some this and you wanna play

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Some that you're not gonna bust out the rock

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Band 2 disc that has 500

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Songs on it and put in the Beatles

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Disc that has 40 songs on it

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
To play a couple songs that's gonna sit on the shelf

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
If you're hardcore enough to own it

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Unless they do a disc swap thing like

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Singstar does that could happen

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Still you don't jump up and just go I'm gonna switch

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Discs yes you're gonna be like

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Man I'm gonna play some other song

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
We do that with Singstar

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
Singstar's awesome

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Bullymania in chat says Singstar Abba

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Went back in time and influenced the Beatles

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Yes

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Remember though when we used to play

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
We used to play

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
What the hell game was it

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
No

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Beatmania when we used to

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Switch out our Append discs

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Oh yes the Appends

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
It was kind of a pain in the ass though

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
That was a good point

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
But it was all we had and now there's a better way

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I will own

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
The Beatles

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Whether it's the rock band Beatles whether it's what

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Because I'm of not that generation

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
But the generation after and you know

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I have the Beatles on my

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
iPod even though I don't own any

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Vinyl you know

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I like the music

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Especially some of the later stuff

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
You know the earlier stuff just doesn't do it for me

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
But it's just like you know they're important

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
You know you should own it

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
If you're into

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
If you're into the niche

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
I mean it's not really even a niche but if you're into the part of the industry

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Which we are which is music

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Games

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
If you own Drummania controllers

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
You should probably own this fucking game

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
And if you don't

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
It's gonna depend on how big of a

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Beatles fan you are

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Unless they completely bastardize it

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Which is a possibility sadly

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Which totally is but I don't

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I don't really believe that

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
With Yoko having control I don't believe it either

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Well it's not just Yoko having control

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Cause take Yoko and John Lennon

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
And the dead Beatles and the living Beatles

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
And all that out of it

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Harmonix

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Is gonna have such reverence

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
For the source material

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
That there is no possible way

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
That's true if they fuck it up

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
There will be no forgiveness

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Yeah exactly if they mess it up

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
There will be pitches

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
There will be torches and pitchforks

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
And people will be dying

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
And I mean well you laugh

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
But that's all there is

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
It's gonna be brutal the fallout

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Plus you know

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
If you thought the ET game fallout was bad

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
There's money

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Being thrown at this

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
This is an expensive project

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
This is a

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
This is a deal breaker for harmonix

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
If they mingle this

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
You know it's

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
It's over

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
But act deft has a point harmonix never ever fails to deliver

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Harmonix has very rarely

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Failed in any way shape or form

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Amplitude was a little

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Disappointing after frequency

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And I know I'm gonna get some people being like

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
F you pal for that

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
But frequency was just better

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
Alright F you pal

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
We're gonna open it

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Hey if you wanna tell Dan F you pal to his face

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
F me

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
You can call in right now

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Flip me off

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
I'm flipping myself off

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Amplitude was a great game

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Our username on skype

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Is orange lounge radio

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
And you can tell Dan F off right now

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Let's open up the phones

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
We have a caller on the line

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Hi who's this?

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Hi this is Spazinator

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Just

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Two or three really

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Quick things

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Regarding tonight's show

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Yes

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Regarding the whole using

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Of trained cats for

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
advertising

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
What if something goes

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Wrong with the cats

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
What if there is like a catastrophe

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Using I'm sorry using the what?

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Using the trained cats

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
For the advertisement

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
You mentioned in part A

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
I believe of the show

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Oh the cats what if something goes wrong

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
What if something goes wrong with the

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
The trained cats

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
That are doing the

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
PETA's gonna write a nasty letter

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
I'm sorry

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
What was that?

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I said PETA's gonna write a nasty letter

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
For one I don't know I guess I'm assuming

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
These things are under watch I don't think they

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Just have these kitties all roaming the streets

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Aimlessly I mean there's gotta be

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Something where

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
They've got the cats tracked

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Somehow or the cats are

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
They're being watched

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Which seems like a lot of fucking

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
Work for a stinking ad campaign

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
But there's gotta be something they're doing

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
No doubt that's easy

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I don't know if I was like

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
I don't know if I had a mic when you guys were talking

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Yeah I was playing Street Fighter

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Yeah that's the worst thing I've ever heard

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
I don't understand what the point is

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Most people see a cat

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Running around and they're just like hey it's a cat

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
I suppose if I saw a cat wearing a fear t-shirt

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I'd be like hey it's a cat wearing a t-shirt

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
But I wouldn't go man

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Fear I gotta buy that fucking game

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
That gets me in the mode to play some MF in 360

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
BlackWolf in chat wants to point out

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
You can see the leashes in the pictures

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
They're on leashes that's how they got it

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Cats hate leashes by the way

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
You know those cats are pissed

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
That's a water spitting leash

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
That is right there

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
So what else did you want to call in about Spaznator?

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Secondly

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
I know that

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
You guys have been complaining about

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
The wind out there in California

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
It could be a whole lot worse

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I didn't know

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
If you guys have been paying attention

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
To the news

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Within basketball days

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
But just in my

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Neck of the woods

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
We just had kind of a semi

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Major plane crash

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
In Buffalo don't you

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I just remembered

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
You got this all wrong by the way

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
We probably actually kind of like the wind

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Because wind is cool

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
We hate the fact that at the sign of a stiff breeze

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Our internet goes down

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
People forget how to drive

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
And shit starts falling over

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
The storms here are nothing compared to the east coast

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I'll tell you nothing compared to the east coast

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
We don't have hurricanes here

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
If we had a hurricane here we'd all die

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
We would be dead

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
If we can't deal with the hurricane winds

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
It's because our buildings can't

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
They're built for earthquakes not winds

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Seriously

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I swear

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
I really

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Don't have a problem

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
With driving in wind

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Because I have driven

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
In heavy wind

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
It's just seeing

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
How many people can

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
People running around with chickens with their heads cut off

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
It's nuts

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
I definitely have seen the news

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I heard about that plane crash in Buffalo

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
What a tragedy

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
There's really no other word to describe it

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Nobody was drunk

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
It wasn't carelessness

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Everything I've heard says it was an ice thing

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Causing a malfunction

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
It was just a tragedy

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Very very sad

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I can just imagine there's just reporters

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
And the media and things swarming

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
All over that town right now

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Plus everybody having to deal with that

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
It was a flight

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
A lot of people were from Buffalo

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
So it's just very very sad

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
They need one of those pilots

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Who managed to land a plane in the river

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
And not have anyone get killed on every flight

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Just some sort of goddamn miracle worker

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
That guy is from California

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
He's from the wonderfully named

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Town of Danville

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I remember that

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
I'm really sorry to hear about that

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
You're calling us

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
You must be okay

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Not at least

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Before I let you guys go

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Would you be able to give

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
A really really quick shout out

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
To my link show in Final Fantasy 11

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Sure why not

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
We've had a lot of plugs tonight

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Shout out Suck, don't do it

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
I just want to say hi to

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Doc Scarry link show on the

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Alexander server

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Specifically Naggy

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Naggy and

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Meg and

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Axl0

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
And everyone else

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Who is online right now

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Just want to say hi to everyone

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Alright shout out you guys

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Now go play a real MMO

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Dude you so stole the words out of my mouth

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
I'm going to be like now please

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Sell your copies

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
You know I'm just bitter because I spent so many years on Final Fantasy 11

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
But you know what

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I've heard they made a lot of good changes for the better

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
I need to not give a shit

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I would like to see them

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
You know because Final Fantasy 11 is over

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Like what it's almost 6 years old now

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
I would like to see them do it

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
I would like to see them do a new one

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Mine and Jamie's new computers absolutely

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Destroy the benchmark

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
The benchmark program

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
The benchmark program is awesome it's just loaded with Taro Taro's

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I know they're just like

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
I will say Final Fantasy 11 did bring us Taro Taro's

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Alright Spazinator we're going to let you go buddy

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Sure sounds good

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Have a good one later

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
And yes I'm reminded by the chat room

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
That the Hello Kitty Online beta opened yesterday

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
So that's something I might need to check out

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Hello Kitty Bob

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
There's the MMO you ought to be playing

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Oh man we got to be all over

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
We need an Orange Lounge clan on the Hello Kitty Online

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
We need to like

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
But we need to be like bad people

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I don't know how that works

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
All these great companies are going to have a business

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
And Sanrio just keeps plugging along

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Oh got to love them

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Hey you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000
It's Hello Kitty Jason clan member 3000

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Awesome what's up

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Do you remember the clan

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
What's up Hello Kitty

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Kitty klutz clan

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:32.000
Are you responsible for what's happening with the black DS

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Cause I don't think that's right

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I'm going to back away slowly from these comments

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Jason please put our show back on track

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
What did you want to talk about tonight

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
That confused me a whole lot but that's okay

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
It's interesting that Dan talks about that pilot

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
That did the water landing being brought up in California

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Because our news was all over the place

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Cause he went to school in Colorado

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
There you go see

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
That's why he's good

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Cause he moved somewhere else and learned something

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
What did you call in to talk about tonight Jason

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Did people really believe

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
That Nintendo on

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
You mentioned in part A

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
That the whole

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
3D room environment

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Of the Wii

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Was still code name the revolution

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Did people seriously believe

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
You know there was people that believed it

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
And I will even admit

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
There was a period of 5 minutes

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Where I kind of wished it was true

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
It wasn't true believe

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Actually there's something really funny

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
You can say about that because the first 5 minutes

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Of the trailer you can completely believe

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
The first half of that trailer

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Was beautiful

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
It was amazing

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
But when he

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
We just believed that Nintendo

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Was going to fuck us up for life

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
That they were going to come up with something that was so

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Bad ass

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Like a video game system that you play

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
And it sucks your dick while you're doing it

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Yes you just couldn't resist

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
It's awesomeness

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
And then they gave us the Wii

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Because it was supposed to be totally revolutionary

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
That it's like

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
You know you have a system called the revolution

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
It's going to be

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
You know something very awesome

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
But a game system that fucks me while I play it

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
That's revolutionary

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
It was going to be something completely different

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
And instead

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
We got the last generation of console again

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
With

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
A controller that gets

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Grandmas don't want to play

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
And that's I guess good

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
For everybody

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Grandma would play a fuck me revolution

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Who would Konami sue then?

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Seriously though

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
It's just

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
It's a great console

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
For everybody but gamers

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Or

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
It's a great console for gamers

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
With really low standards

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
And low self esteem

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Okay

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Well yeah

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Because of course it's low self esteem

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Because your Nintendo keeps telling you you're fat

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Nintendo goes you're fat

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
You're ugly

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Have you ever set that up? Do you half Wii Fit?

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Yes I do

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
And you make your Mii stand there and he's looking all nice

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
And confident and then you jump on that board

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
And it detects what you weigh

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
And then the guy just sort of slouches

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
And then gets fat

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
And then yeah it starts harassing you

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
I'm sorry this is more accurate for

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
What you are

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Exactly I played brain age

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
And my DS told me I was stupid

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
You have the brain of an 85 year old Alzheimer's patient

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Your brain is 65 years old

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
It's tired now

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
You can't understand the word blue

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Stupid

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
The next time I see Reggie I'm going to punch him in the face

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Which gets hundreds of thousands

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Of hits on the entire web

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
So I mean I don't know

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
It's not that what Nintendo's done isn't

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Quote unquote revolutionary

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
To you know

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
The mass market video game

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
Public who hasn't played a game system

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Since they played the 2600 from Atari

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
But it's not

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
You know the next generation for gamers

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
And when Nintendo was telling us

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
The Wii is going to mess you up

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
The Wii is going to be something that you will never

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Expect

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
We're going to redefine video games

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
The Wii is going to take your mother out to date

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
And then sex her

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
The Wii is going to get your mom out the house

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
So that you can have orgasmic video game experiences

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
We were ready for that

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
And what we got was the Wii

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
And so I mean did we believe it?

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
No

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Did we speculate about it? Sure

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Instead we've got my mom

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Who won't get off the fucking TV because she's playing

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Elibits

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
We didn't know it was going to be

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
The GameCube 2

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
You guys talking about it

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Just made me think about that trailer

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
The first half of it was great

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
But as soon as it said Nintendo on

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
The music changed and he actually tried to

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Make up what the system

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Was going to be

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
If

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
I don't know

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
What to do

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I don't know how to describe the people that believe

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
The second half of that trailer

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Mario looked like Luigi for crying out loud

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Nintendo has never

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Done that

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Has never made concept art that looks that bad

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Mushroom Kingdom was in a forest

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
The video just cut out abruptly

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
And

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Virtual environments don't exist

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
You don't make games

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
I guess there's RPG Maker but

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Yeah that made good games

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Anyways

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
It was Nintendo trying to convince you that the world

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Was going to change

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
If the fanboys believe it's strong enough it will come

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Exactly

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
They were going to say look the 360 you think that's great

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Maybe you see what we got for you

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
That's something that Sony was the master of

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
In the last generation

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And they used that to bury the Dreamcast

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Sony was the master

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
In the last generation just like rumble was

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
That's what PlayStation 2 does

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Because the PlayStation 2 is going to mess you up for life

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
And they were sort of right

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
But they used it to bury the system

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Nintendo just did the same thing

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
And it worked

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
It fucking worked again

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
From Nintendo, Nintendo watched Sony and just learned

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
They were like look

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
We're going to sit out this generation with this little GameCube

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
And we're going to put out some good games for the hardcore

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
But the next generation, we're going to dominate again

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
And you know what, they did

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Because that's what Nintendo does

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
They make mistakes

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
And they conquer the god damn world

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
And you know the DS has done it

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
And I remember when the DS came out

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Everybody was like wow

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
They replaced the GBA with this

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
This thing sucks

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
And look at the DS now

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
It's standard gamer equipment

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
If you don't have one

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
There's something wrong with you

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
And the Wii is kind of the same way

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Except for the fact that gamers own it

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Then they look at me and they go

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
What am I going to have to buy for it?

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
And I'm like Mario Kart and Smash Brothers are both worth owning

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
And Zelda's always fun

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
And if you don't own Mario Galaxy

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
You may as well sell your Wii

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And that's it

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
Oh, Metroid Prime 2

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
That's still at least five games I guess

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Those are all the Nintendo franchises

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Well Jason, thank you for the lively discussion

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
And also thank you

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
While I have you on for all the hard work you and Digman did on the new website

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
It looks great

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
And I know the chatters are loving it

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
They're filling it up with articles

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
We're very excited

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
I know what you have to thank me for

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Dan was the one that carried that whole segment

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
And Digman was the one doing the whole website

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Practically doing all the website work

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
You were the one calling

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
I know you helped him

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
So thank you for the help

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
I know Digman probably did the biggest chunk of that

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
But he used to get some props

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Alright well Jason we're going to let you go

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Because we're going to wrap up the show

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
We've got to get out of here

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
We've got to get out of here

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Especially if we're going to try and do some stuff with Street Fighter 4

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I don't know if Justin TV is up again

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
But we'll at least try to get YouTube or something

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
I restart my computer because

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
I figure maybe restarting the computer

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Will make it work

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Now my desktop likes to refresh itself

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Over and over and over

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
And over and over and over

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
My Mac

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Stopped working after I did an update

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
My laptop is sitting in there

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
I can't do a damn thing with it

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
I restart it and I just get the logo with the little spinning thing

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
And my friends online told me to use the shift

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Use the S key, it still won't work

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
I'm not worried about that because

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
I haven't really done any actual updates

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
With this in a while so I need to do

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
Service Pack 3 and that kind of stuff

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
But it's just

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
It's still kind of funny

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Because it's annoying

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Because all my icons disappear and then they come back

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
And then they disappear and come back

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
And disappear and come back

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
But I'm trying it one last time here

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
And restarting it didn't anything

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
I did search on the problem too

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
And there was some guy that had the problem back in 2007

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
And no one seemed to have an answer

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Except shut down

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Flash Media Encoder and restart it

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
I'm like okay I've done that eight times now

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
It doesn't do anything, stupid

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Alright we'll try to figure out

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
What's going on there but

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
For the meanwhile we are going to get the hell

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Out of here, we're going to pack it up

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
And get on out because we still have the after birth

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
We got to do too so we got to fly through that

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
And get out of here so

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Let's go around and first we'll get some last minute stories

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Before we close up shop

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Do we have last minute stories tonight?

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Yes

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Nice, anything else?

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Loki do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
No I don't have anything ready because I've been trying to get

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Flash Media Encoder to work

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Alright wow a night with no last minute stories

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Then we'll go around and hear everybody's final thoughts

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
Dan thank you so much for being here once again

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
And contributing

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
We always love your

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Opinions and such

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Especially being a long time gaming fan

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Come back again sometime

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Yeah four or five years maybe

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Alright

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Any final thoughts for listeners?

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Yeah Street Fighter 4

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Is absolutely legit

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Although

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
The Xbox controller

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Is a way of making fighting games

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
It's like

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Slamming your dick in a door

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
It's just not any fun

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
If you buy Street Fighter 4 for your 360

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
And you're not going to invest in an arcade stick

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
You're high

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
I'm thinking about getting it for PS3

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
Just on the controller alone even though I know more people on 360

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
I don't know

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Dark Sakura since you're right over there

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Enjoy the tea and the parting

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Gifts from me

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
I so will enjoy the tea

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
I might make you save me a bag

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Which I know is a dumpy thing to do for a gift

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
But I really want to try it

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Shut up Dan

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners?

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
I'm glad I have tomorrow off

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Because my voice hurts

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Rub it in why don't you?

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Loki do you have any final thoughts?

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
No I'm just

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Pissed off now because explore keeps

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Crashing and reinstalling

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I just have to actually go do real

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
Updates because I've been

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Just letting it do its crappy automatic updates

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
Stuff and you know

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Whatever

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
And my final thought is I would like to be

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Over having clogged up sinuses

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Now

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Alright there you go just approve it

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Alright

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
That's brisk baby

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Alright thank you guys so much for downloading

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Real source of income

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
It really is a labor of love like look at the new website

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
That was done for nothing

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
And everything and it's just amazing

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000

So what do you say we do it all again next week?

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Okay why not

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
We'll do it anyway

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
We'll see you here next week for Orange Lounge
