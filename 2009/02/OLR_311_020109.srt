00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,240
Today, February 1, 2009, could Wii photo printing come to the US, Gears of War PC breaks down,

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:32,360
and multiplayer comes to the next Bioshock game.

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
What football game?

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,360
Hey, welcome everybody to another week of Orange Launch Radio.

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,520
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,320
and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,360
And we are always here every week to talk to you guys live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
Joining me for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,220
Not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,560
She is on a little vacation, I don't know if you'd call it a vacation.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,520
I think she had family stuff going on up in the lovely state of Washington, but not the

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,040
parts like Seattle, Tacoma, like where PAX happens, and the part we were all at just

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
a little bit last year.

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,600
She's in some town called Prosser, which I think is not quite as exciting as Seattle.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,920
So yeah, she's been updating her Twitter.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,960
If you follow DarkSaga on Twitter, she's been updating her Twitter pretty regularly.

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,400
It's basically the equivalent of help me, please send help.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,080
I miss Wi-Fi.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
Help me.

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
So joining us tonight, we have a different female perspective.

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,080
Say hello to the one and only Rice Princess.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
Hello.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
How are you doing, Rice Princess?

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,120
Oh, I'm all right.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
How about you?

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Not bad, not bad.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,600
Are you caring about the Super Bowl that's going on right now as we're doing the show?

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,880
No, but I'm caring about Resident Evil 5.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,400
Rice Princess just found out that I actually downloaded the Resident Evil 5 demo and she's

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
dying to play.

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
Are you a big Resident Evil fan?

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
I am.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
How big?

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,800
I've played all of the games.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Even four and one, all of them?

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Yeah.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,720
And if I were like a billionaire, I'd recreate the mansion.

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
How about the movies?

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Are you a big fan of the movies?

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,080
I actually do like the movies too.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Yeah.

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
They're awesome.

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
I heard some rumor, I don't think it made the show well tonight, some rumor there's

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,760
a fourth one that's going to be made pretty soon.

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,800
Do you think it should keep going or do you think they need to pull the plug now?

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,960
It depends on where they take the story.

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,920
If they're keep, I don't know, like because this last one that they came out with was

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,580
an original story and it was just, I don't know, it was all right.

49
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,560
If they go back to like the game story stuff, that'd be cool.

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
All right.

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
We'll also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Hello.

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
How you doing, Loki?

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,480
Fine, I'm trying to find the Transformers 2 trailer and apparently the link that we

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,640
had in our chat room, it's not working or at least it works, but it's not playing.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,880
I see the real reason why people watch the Super Bowl, the commercials and the movie

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
trailers.

58
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,680
You know, the smart people would realize that you can actually watch commercials before

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,560
they come out on the Super Bowl, or at least for most of the trailers and, well not trailers

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
but commercials.

61
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,920
They actually have a website that had some, I was watching them earlier.

62
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
They suck.

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,680
Well, some of them suck, but most of them were not good.

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Well, also joining us every week is the ever present fourth guest on the show, the chat

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,440
room and we have a acidic vampire in chat making a comment about Resident Evil.

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,400
Degeneration was better than the live action movies, although extinction was okay.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
I really did like every regeneration.

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,920
I do want to give a special shout out to the chatters tonight because they are here during

69
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,880
the Super Bowl and so, you know, they're either football haters or they are very loyal listeners

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
of Orange Lawn Radio.

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,800
We only have probably about, you know, there was no Bobby tonight to lead into our show.

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,840
He took the night off for the Super Bowl and we probably only have, between everything

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,800
that's been going on, probably about a third of the usual listeners we have.

74
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,560
So I want to really thank those folks that were loyal and stay in tune tonight.

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,440
I also want to thank, joining us tonight in studio, say hello to Silent Nathan is here

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
again.

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Hello.

78
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Hello.

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,000
No, seriously, how are you Nathan?

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How are you doing?

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm fine.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,160
I have a motorcycle.

83
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,760
You have a motorcycle?

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,960
What game do you have a motorcycle in?

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,720
Because I know you don't have one for real.

86
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,040
Because I would have wanted to ride in the sidecar.

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
World of Warcraft.

88
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Nerd.

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,640
No, I'm just kidding.

90
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,080
Describe to the listeners what having a motorcycle means in World of Warcraft and how exactly

91
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,940
does it fit into the lore?

92
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:26,080
It goes vroom, vroom, vroom, and then you can make it jump and it's lore-wise...

93
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,680
Who cares?

94
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,200
It's a motorcycle.

95
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,000
How hard is it to get a motorcycle in the game?

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,480
It's not hard, it's expensive.

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Just expensive.

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Did you have to do a lot of quests?

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,400
Did you have to save a lot of princesses and storm a lot of castles?

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I'm hoarded so I usually have to kill the princesses and destroy the castles, but yeah,

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,880
it's at least 12,000 gold just for vendor mats, so it's a lot of money.

102
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,240
Well congratulations on your motorcycle.

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,040
One day I will come back to WoW and I will ride in your motorcycle in the sidecar.

104
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,080
It'll be fun.

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,480
You have to come back within a month, otherwise you can't.

106
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,240
But if I stay away for three months, then somebody can use the Scroll of Resurrection

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,480
on me, and that's the whole plan, actually.

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,640
You should actually cancel your account, start a whole new account, and we can be the leveling

109
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,080
buddies and we'll get awesome mounts.

110
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,040
There you go.

111
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,480
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks in a segment we always like to start off the

112
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,720
show with called How Is Your Gaming Week?

113
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,880
But Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

114
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,440
How is your gaming week?

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,740
It was still not that eventful, but more eventful than last week.

116
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,360
More Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360, still playing stuff, which is, you know, it's fun.

117
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm looking forward to the new expansion they have coming out in I think a week or so.

118
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,440
And then, let's see, I tried a little bit more Fable 2, went and downloaded the expansion

119
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
for that.

120
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,480
I haven't got a chance to play that yet, but I went and ran around a little bit and killed

121
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
a few things.

122
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,960
I don't know, Fable 2 is kind of okay for me.

123
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,640
Why I decided to download the expansion when it's just okay is beyond me.

124
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,360
I was like, I'm gonna do that.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
Wait a second.

126
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,880
Because you're a consumer whore.

127
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,080
But whatever, it's all good.

128
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,280
So I'll probably, I'm trying to get back into that.

129
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,880
And then finally, you know, after trying everything to get Grand Theft Auto 4 to work, I had to

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,400
go back and do a system restore before it broke, and hooray, it works again!

131
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,240
After I had to do some more futzing around with it because, you know, I got a different

132
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,080
error message this time, but at least that was fixable, so.

133
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,660
It works again, but the question is, for how long?

134
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,920
So I'm excited about that because now I get to play with the mods again.

135
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,960
You went on such a tangent last week.

136
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,520
Oh, I'm still very disappointed with him because the fact that I have to patch.

137
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,240
They released some patch this week, right?

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,880
It did nothing to fix my problem.

139
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,160
And you know, I hear it's causing more problems, so whatever.

140
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,800
You want to hear something funny, and this isn't even on our show roll, apparently there

141
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:24,320
is issues with Secure ROM's CD activation or authentication thing that they have running.

142
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,040
So somebody had asked them, they had some problems, and Secure ROM just linked them

143
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,400
to a program that bypasses the CD check, or the DVD check.

144
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,160
So which, of course, that person posted that everywhere on the internet.

145
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:47,400
So now there is literally an official no DVD patch for the game.

146
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,680
So they've made it, you know, pretty easy to pirate the game, I guess.

147
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,840
Well, technically you're not supposed to be able to pirate it because you still have to

148
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,080
authenticate it and the serial number and everything like that to play online.

149
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,560
But trust me, you don't really have to because it's able to be done.

150
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,640
But now it doesn't check for the DVD.

151
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,400
So that might solve some problems, at least some people are having.

152
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,320
But yeah, I don't know, I'm interested to play the game a little bit more now.

153
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:25,520
Also since I believe this add-on is exclusive for the Xbox 360, however people have found

154
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,400
the models and stuff hidden within the code data or whatever.

155
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,320
So I'll be seeing how they're going to modify stuff for the PC version.

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,200
I don't know, PC version is this fun.

157
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
All the mod stuff.

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,360
Alright, so nuclear grenades, it sounds like you've warmed up a little bit to the PC one

159
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
as opposed to last week.

160
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,200
No, I still hate the way that they, no listen, I've warmed up to the fact that I can mod

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
it.

162
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,480
I am not giving them any, you know, gimmes on the fact that it's just a really poor port

163
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,800
whatsoever and the fact, the way they handled everything.

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
There is no reason I should have to do a system restore to get a game to work.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
That's absolutely ridiculous.

166
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,120
Because that screws up a bunch of other stuff on my computer, so I have to hopefully make

167
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,920
sure everything's working now.

168
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,000
But it's absolutely ridiculous that I would have to do a system restore to get a game

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to work.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
Any game.

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,640
Even Crysis, I had less trouble running.

172
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,520
And goddamn Crysis is a bitch to, you know, work.

173
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,480
And sadly enough, Crysis actually runs better than Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's telling

174
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
you something.

175
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,480
And trust me, Grand Theft Auto IV is not Crysis, is definitely not pushing the graphics that

176
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Crysis was.

177
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,720
I think Acidic Vampire in chat sums it up very well.

178
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,400
It's a love-hate relationship for Loki.

179
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,440
It is a love-hate relationship.

180
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,120
You love to hate it.

181
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Anything else for your gaming week?

182
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,280
No, that was pretty much it.

183
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,240
I have to ask for our spin-off show, Orange Lounge Foodio.

184
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,560
You're pretty excited about the food you brought to the show tonight.

185
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,520
Can you tell our listeners about this fine new cuisine of yours?

186
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,920
It's not a fine cuisine, but they have these new things at Burger King called Burger Shots,

187
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,200
and they're basically...

188
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,040
Like when you first said the name, I was like, what popped in my head were like the dessert

189
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,720
shots from Applebee's and stuff.

190
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,160
I'm like, ew, that does not sound appetizing at all.

191
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,800
Putting a hamburger in a glass, nasty.

192
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,960
Putting hamburger and ketchup and mustard in a shot glass, that's disgusting.

193
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
No, they're sliders.

194
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,640
They're little mini hamburgers, basically, and you can buy them.

195
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
They have a two-pack and a six-pack.

196
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Why would you want a two-pack?

197
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,600
You don't want to get fat?

198
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I don't know.

199
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
They're okay.

200
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,480
They're all right.

201
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,680
This is the second time I've had them, and it's just kind of okay now.

202
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,360
It's not as good as their normal burgers.

203
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,920
You don't have the smoky, flame-broiled taste to it, but they're okay.

204
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
They're kind of neat.

205
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,120
Isn't it the same thing they used to have years ago, but they were called burger buddies?

206
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
I don't remember that.

207
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
It was like 15 years ago.

208
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,840
This is when I was a kid.

209
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Burger buddies?

210
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Yeah, something like that.

211
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,160
Like, did you play with them?

212
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,680
No, they were little, tiny, miniature hamburgers.

213
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I remember that.

214
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
I used to love them.

215
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,160
Could I have some burger buddies, please?

216
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
Shut up, Rice Princess.

217
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Tell us about your gaming week.

218
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Back to gaming.

219
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Rice Princess.

220
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Okay.

221
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,560
Well, I'm going to play the demo of Resident Evil 5, and that's going to be my gaming

222
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
week.

223
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Yay.

224
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
I'm going to play.

225
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Yeah, very much.

226
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,880
I might turn around, and then suddenly Rice Princess is gone, and so is my Xbox 360.

227
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
Or your PS3, because I wouldn't...

228
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't think they have the demo on PlayStation 3, actually.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wait, what?

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
I thought it was on your PS3.

231
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,560
No, it's on my Xbox 360.

232
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
I don't think they released a demo on PS3.

233
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,040
I hate you, but I love Resident Evil.

234
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,520
It was exclusive on the 360 for a week.

235
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Damn it.

236
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Okay.

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,440
Well, that means if you want to wait until next week, they'll have it on PlayStation

238
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
3.

239
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,680
It's exactly the same game.

240
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,080
Yeah, but it's on an Xbox.

241
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,280
My hands will melt if I touch the controller.

242
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,680
I used to be like that.

243
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm still like that.

244
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,600
And then there were a lot more games that came out, and it was a lot cheaper.

245
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,080
I'm still going to play it.

246
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm just going to put on gloves or something.

247
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,280
Just pretend it's something else.

248
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,520
I don't know why you have this rampant hate for Xbox, but whatever.

249
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,840
I'm like, Xbox hate is so like five years ago.

250
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,400
I mean, we're all kind of over it now.

251
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,080
It's not hate, it's just extreme dislike.

252
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,560
If you go back into the early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, there used to be plenty

253
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,800
of Xbox hate when that first Xbox came out.

254
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,000
Remember the controller that was so massive that only a gorilla could use it, really?

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,680
But now, Xbox is actually pretty cool.

256
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,960
A lot's changed, Rice Princess, within the now.

257
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,600
Except they have never fixed the D-pad, and that is unacceptable.

258
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
That's true.

259
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Exactly.

260
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,480
All right.

261
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Let's see, my gaming week.

262
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week, kind of a lot

263
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,040
of the old stuff, you know, Fable 2, and same stuff I've been playing.

264
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Next week, though, thanks to a very, very, very kind listener, I've got a code for Left

265
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,800
for Dead now, so I'm going to be playing that on PC this week.

266
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
I'm very excited.

267
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,320
And to follow up a question that came up last week, there is an Orange Lounge Radio Steam

268
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,800
community out there, and I was able to find it very easy by going into Steam and just

269
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,200
searching for Orange Lounge in groups, so I joined it.

270
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,360
So there's about 30-some-odd people in the Orange Lounge Radio Steam group, so if you

271
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,040
are a Left for Dead player, you're listening to this show, I encourage you to join our

272
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,600
Steam group, because I'll probably be playing Left for Dead, and I want to play with listeners,

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,960
but you have to promise to be nice to me, because I suck at first-person shooters.

274
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,720
So even if I accidentally shoot you and think you're a zombie or whatever, you have to be

275
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
nice to me.

276
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
You know what they mean in that game?

277
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,720
That would be kind of fun.

278
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
What?

279
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,040
Because you know how they, like, mix stuff around, you know, like, Half-Life and stuff,

280
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,720
and it's all in the source engine anyways.

281
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,800
Maybe a portal gun in Left for Dead.

282
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
You never know.

283
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
That would be kind of funny.

284
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
What about the Gravity Gun?

285
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Both.

286
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
You never know.

287
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Yeah.

288
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,680
Otherwise, the other game I've been playing this week, kind of funny, I kind of, you know,

289
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,580
we had the whole conversation last week about how I left WoW, but this week I kind of dabbled

290
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,760
in another MMO.

291
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,360
I played Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst this week, which is funny because Sega, like, stopped

292
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
supporting that game years ago.

293
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,800
Well, there's a pirate server that you can play on for free, and I'm okay with talking

294
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,760
about it on the show, because Sega kind of turns a blind eye to the whole thing, because

295
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,740
they turned their servers off a while ago, so they just kind of let this thing run.

296
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
So it's interesting.

297
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,640
It's kind of tough to play, because they're still, like, I can't do a lot of the quests

298
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,680
because they're all in the Japanese text still, but it's Phantasy Star Online, and it's free,

299
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
so I can't complain.

300
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,560
I don't think I'll play it forever, but ah, memories.

301
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,720
Wow.

302
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,880
How long ago did that come out?

303
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Let's see.

304
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,520
If the Dreamcast is about 10 years old, right, Dreamcast came out 9-9-99, right?

305
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
I think so.

306
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,640
I would say the first Phantasy Star Online is probably about 9 years old.

307
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Holy crap.

308
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,080
I know, it's an old game.

309
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
I know.

310
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,000
But still, I mean, there's not a lot of, like, action-based MMOs like that.

311
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can't even really call Phantasy Star Online an MMO, though.

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I mean, it is and it isn't.

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,080
It's not an MMO like WoW, you know, you go off, everything's like instanced.

314
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,500
It's more Guild Wars, I guess, than anything, but it's not even like that.

315
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
It's like action-based.

316
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
It is pretty cool, though.

317
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Yeah, I know.

318
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,960
It's really stood the test of time, you know?

319
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,360
Even though a lot of people hate on universe, I don't mind universe.

320
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,640
I think I have Phantasy Star Online for my Dreamcast, because I remember I always would

321
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
play it offline.

322
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,680
I would never play it online, because I just, you know, I had dial-up at the time, you know,

323
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,240
so it didn't really make...

324
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,880
That'd be kind of hard, yeah.

325
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,600
Well, I mean, they did have a dial-up modem in, you know, Dreamcast, so...

326
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:31,080
Well, apparently, this server will let you connect the Dreamcast one, the PlaySta...

327
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Was there a PlayStitch one?

328
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I don't know.

329
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,800
The GameCube one, I know, was on there, and the PC one.

330
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,720
You can connect all those together on this one server.

331
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,800
This is Blue Burst, right?

332
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,840
You can use either the Blue Burst client or the Dreamcast client, and it's episode one,

333
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
two, and four.

334
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,220
You can play them all together, which I thought was kind of cool.

335
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,880
Just not the Xbox one, because the Xbox one was through Xbox Live, and so there's no way

336
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,360
you can play that anymore, because Sega shut down the server, and you can't really hack

337
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,760
Xbox Live servers without a lot of problems, so...

338
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,280
Well, you can, but...

339
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah, again, it's not something I think I'm gonna play a long time.

340
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,120
It's just, you know, nostalgia's pretty cool, so...

341
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,040
Because, you know, honestly, the cave level gets so boring after a while.

342
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,520
It totally does.

343
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Have you even played PSO?

344
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
No.

345
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
But I'm sure it does.

346
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
It does.

347
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
It does.

348
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Okay, I take...

349
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
I never got to the cave level.

350
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Really?

351
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,520
No.

352
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
You just played Forest over and over again?

353
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Yep, that's all I did.

354
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Oh my god, you must have been bored.

355
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,920
You can do caves at, like, level seven.

356
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
You don't have to get that far.

357
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,560
I don't think I played Phantasy Star Online that long, because I remember I tried fighting

358
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,200
the first, like, dragon or whatever it was, and I died, and I'm like, I'm gonna go play

359
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
a different game now.

360
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,920
Yeah, it helps to have friends to do the dragon, but, you know...

361
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,680
Remember, I was playing single player, so I had no friends.

362
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,240
Aww, poor Loki.

363
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,680
Well everyone else had PlayStation, and, you know, the only reason I had Dreamcast is because

364
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,520
I wanted to use our all-nighter event.

365
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
I'm like, oh-kay.

366
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Wow.

367
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,200
Hey, Dreamcast are still awesome.

368
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,320
I mean, because of the fact that you can boot, like, there's a lot of homebrew stuff for

369
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,120
Dreamcast with the emulators and everything.

370
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,800
I was actually, I'm looking to find a, because I'm not gonna try to buy it, screw that shit.

371
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,560
I'm trying to find a copy of Super Runabout for the Dreamcast, because for some reason,

372
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,240
like, I thought of this one game that I played before, it's called Felny 1179, that was on

373
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,840
the PlayStation 1, and it's a pretty fun game.

374
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,960
It's kind of like, not really like Burnout, but it's a racing game where you're supposed

375
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,600
to crash into a lot of stuff, like, cause a lot of property damage, and as you'd play

376
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,920
through the game, you'd unlock more cars, kind of like Burnout, like ridiculous stuff,

377
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,440
like, you know, meteorite cars, buses, and just all sorts of crazy stuff.

378
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,080
But Super Runabout was kind of the same game, same type of thing, and it was just really

379
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,560
stupid fun.

380
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,380
That's a game that you really, you know, make a new one of, cause you'd be left on Burnout

381
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,600
with collateral damage.

382
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,340
So I need to find that, so I can play that again.

383
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,360
Quite a bit of Dreamcast love coming from our chat room.

384
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,560
We have Leo Shen saying, I still play Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on my Dreamcast all the time.

385
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,080
I love that game so much.

386
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,240
Did you own a Dreamcast?

387
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,160
We did own a Dreamcast, yeah.

388
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,480
TGM-GS6, there's no easy way to pronounce that, says, I need to revive my Dreamcast

389
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,800
so I can play Border Down.

390
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,200
You know, they keep releasing these, like, homebrew things, like, every year for Dreamcast.

391
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,920
I was just thinking today, actually, while I was playing PSO, cause it got me thinking

392
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
about the Dreamcast.

393
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,760
The Dreamcast isn't even 10 years old yet.

394
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,660
You know, it's still, it's not that old of a system, all things considered, so, still

395
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,320
pretty interesting, all the things you can do on it.

396
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,040
Let me ask Silent Nathan real quick how his gaming week was, and then we'll move into

397
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
tonight's news.

398
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,560
Silent Nathan, how was your gaming week?

399
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,680
It takes a long time to make enough gold to buy a motorcycle.

400
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,760
So wow wow and more wow?

401
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
See.

402
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,560
Enough said from Silent Nathan.

403
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,360
Alright, quickly some housekeeping tonight, and then we will get into tonight's gaming

404
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
news.

405
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,360
I just wanted to say really quick, I have to further apologize to those listeners that

406
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,800
listen to us on Justin.tv, because we have no webcam again tonight, but here's the interesting

407
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
thing that's going on.

408
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,440
We actually, a very kind listener over in Japan sent us a webcam, so I want to say thank

409
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
you.

410
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,260
The problem with it though, when we tried to hook it up, we were able to get video but

411
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:27,480
no audio, because the video and audio was separate on it, so we thought it would be

412
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,480
kind of lame to just have the video thing on Justin.tv.

413
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,560
So I have a cord coming that's going to fix our problems, but it's just not going to get

414
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,640
here until this week sometime, because it's coming from New Jersey.

415
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,200
So I'm really, really, really, really hoping we will be back up on Justin.tv next week.

416
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
And yeah, very excited about that.

417
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,760
And then when you come over looking all pretty in the future Rice Princess, it won't be for

418
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,040
nothing, as you did a couple weeks ago.

419
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Yay!

420
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
There you go.

421
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,640
Also, of course, there's no Dark Sakura tonight, but she will be back next week on the program,

422
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,160
and no shows off or anything coming up for us.

423
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,720
We're just cranking right through up until our seventh anniversary this June, if you

424
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,640
can believe it.

425
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Wow.

426
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,440
Possibly some conventions in our future.

427
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,360
I am toying with the idea of going to ASEN.

428
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,440
Do you know it's very cheap to fly out to Chicago right now in Southwest?

429
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Really?

430
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
It's like $99 one way.

431
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Oh, they're having a $99 sale.

432
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
That's why.

433
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Exactly.

434
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
So I might go to ASEN.

435
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
You should.

436
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Just for the heck of it.

437
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,680
It's in May, and I know some of...

438
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
That's like the...

439
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,920
I've been to the East Coast, and I've met listeners on the East Coast.

440
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,160
I've just never been to ASEN's Anime Central, sorry, in Chicago.

441
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,840
I know we have listeners in that area, Chicago area.

442
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
I want to go.

443
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,200
I want to do the panel and the whole nine yards.

444
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,800
I think I'd have a lot of fun.

445
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,560
I'm sure Dark Sakura wants to go.

446
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,160
Loki's wife probably won't let him go.

447
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Well, I don't want to go either.

448
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,720
Who knows?

449
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
Sorry.

450
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,760
We will see.

451
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
I'm going to try.

452
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
I'm going to try.

453
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Trust me.

454
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
If I'm going to go to one show this year, it's going to be E3.

455
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,640
Yeah, E3.

456
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,560
You know E3 registration opened up this week, actually.

457
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,840
So we've got to talk offline about that.

458
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,040
Yeah, because my wife, I don't think she'll mind if I...

459
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,800
She will mind if I go, but she will get over it.

460
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,240
I still think we should take her as a special correspondent.

461
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
She will...

462
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,800
See, we've been talking because I have this thing through my work.

463
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,880
I have a $1,500 trip we've got to take before the end of this year.

464
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,600
So we were saying we're going to go originally to Seattle, and we're going to say, eh, it's

465
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,320
not really much that we really want to do in Seattle.

466
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Go to Prosser.

467
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,640
That's where the party's at this weekend.

468
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,880
We were going to go to possibly L.A. to go to Disneyland, that kind of stuff.

469
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,720
But I mean, it would be around her birthday, and her birthday is the 4th of June, and that's

470
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,960
like the week before.

471
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,560
No, that is the week of E3, I think.

472
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Oh, yeah.

473
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Wow.

474
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
No, no, it's not.

475
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
E3 is like June 2nd through 4th.

476
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
I'm not even kidding you.

477
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Ah, fuck that.

478
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Hold on.

479
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Let me look.

480
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Want, want, want.

481
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Dude, dude, dude.

482
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
I thought it was like the 13th or something.

483
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Just be like, happy birthday, babe.

484
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,560
E3.com.

485
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Look at all these video games I gotcha.

486
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Entrance into E3.

487
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I gotcha.

488
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Goodie bag from E3.

489
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Yeah, June 2nd through 4th.

490
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Ah, you ass.

491
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Oh, no.

492
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,800
Well, there's no way I'm going to E3 now, so.

493
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,560
We'll just be like, but babe, you can get a bunch of swag.

494
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,320
Ah, yeah, that's not going to fly.

495
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,760
You could walk around a bunch of, like, smelly nerds.

496
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Yay.

497
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,120
Yeah, that will not fly.

498
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,080
You should at least try to get down for one day, get back in time for her birthday or

499
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
something.

500
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,160
Because, you know, the third day of E3 is always like the, I am a zombie today, and

501
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,920
just, I'm just going through the motions trying to pick up everything I missed.

502
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
True.

503
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
So, think about it.

504
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Think about it.

505
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
All right.

506
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
I'll think about it.

507
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
All right.

508
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
If we can even get in.

509
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
I know.

510
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,360
Hey, you can pull some strings now.

511
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
You have connections, dude.

512
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Oh, yeah, right.

513
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,440
No, seriously, like, back when we went in 2005, we were still kind of fledgling, but

514
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
now you can just, like.

515
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
That's true.

516
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,680
Because it worked at a certain game company that, I don't know if I should say, because

517
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,760
I don't know if the game company knows that they inadvertently let us in E3, but we got

518
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
those tickets.

519
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Who cares?

520
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,160
We could bring our old badges from 2005 and be like, look, we went in 2005.

521
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,040
No, they specifically have made it, like, you have to reapply even if you went before.

522
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
I don't know.

523
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Anyway.

524
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Damn it.

525
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
We'll worry about that in the upcoming weeks.

526
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
We got time.

527
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
We got time.

528
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
We have at least till May.

529
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
All right.

530
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,600
Anyhow, we got to get into the gaming news tonight.

531
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Ricky!

532
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Get us into some gaming news.

533
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,720
Yes, it's not that exciting, but we may be getting a new channel soon.

534
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,520
Apparently, there is a trademark, well, this is, I think, coming to Europe first.

535
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,200
There was a trademark on the European trademark database that suggests that Nintendo is looking

536
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,520
to bring its DigiCam print channel to Europe and potentially elsewhere as the photo print

537
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
service channel.

538
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,080
And basically what the DigiCam print channel is in Japan is it's a service offered through

539
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,680
Fujifilm that, of course, allows you to print photos that you save to an SD card and you

540
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,780
can upload them off your photo channel.

541
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,200
Can I just, like, use my printer that lets me put the SD card right in front of the printer?

542
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,640
You can also customize them so that you have Nintendo themed photo albums.

543
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,520
You can even order business cards featuring Nintendo backgrounds in Mii pictures and also

544
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,080
the business cards available through, you know, Club Nintendo in Japan as well.

545
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,100
Yeah, I think it's kind of useless, but, you know, whatever.

546
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,920
New services, you know, new.

547
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,920
That it is.

548
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
I guess.

549
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,400
Is that something, you know, you're a Nintendo fangirl, Rice Princess.

550
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
Is this something you'd want to use?

551
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
No.

552
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
No?

553
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
No?

554
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
No.

555
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,320
But if I didn't, I might consider it, but really no.

556
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,080
Some other things coming to the future in Nintendo's world is the Wii Fit body check

557
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
channel.

558
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
What?

559
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,400
The Wii Fit body check channel.

560
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,520
It's going to be something that's launching on the Wii in April.

561
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,920
I guess what this game does, it uses your BMI data, that's your body mass index that

562
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,760
you get from Wii Fit, and you get the step data from personal trainers walking pedometer.

563
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,060
This is in Japan, by the way, because I don't think we have that game here yet.

564
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,000
And you get some personalized guidance from, like, health experts.

565
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,280
Walk more, fatty.

566
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Stay healthy.

567
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,460
Or they'll probably say, you should actually play your Wii Fit game because we know you

568
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,920
stopped about a week after you bought it.

569
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,080
Now there's speculation there that, you know, this channel again has been announced for

570
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Japan, the Wii Fit body check channel, but they also have trademarked something called

571
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,560
Nintendo Active Health.

572
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,760
That was something that was trademarked in Europe a little earlier this year, so maybe

573
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,080
this is the same thing.

574
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Who knows?

575
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,520
I think Active Health might, it might be the DS game.

576
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,920
The DS, instead of personal trainer walking, it's Active Health or some sort of, I don't

577
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
know.

578
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,720
I could see it, you know, tying in with Wii Fit and stuff and then maybe them doing, like,

579
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,880
updates Wii Fit to, you know, incorporate data from that.

580
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

581
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
Update Wii Fit?

582
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
No, no, no.

583
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,240
Nintendo doesn't do updates like that.

584
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
No, no, no.

585
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
They don't do patches and shit.

586
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Well, I know.

587
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
They will release Wii Fit 2.

588
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
No, no.

589
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,800
Well, of course, yes, they'll do that, but I'm saying that they'll release this channel

590
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,000
and they'll tie in, you know, it'll be able to tie in with the DS game.

591
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I guess.

592
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Yeah, what, what, what extra kind of tips are you gonna get from these health professionals

593
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,320
who don't even, like, see you, you know?

594
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,320
These games do nothing about your diet, do they?

595
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
No.

596
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,320
I don't think so.

597
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,800
I mean, if you really want to lose weight, it has to be an eating and exercise thing,

598
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
right?

599
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Me, sometimes.

600
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Everything I've ever heard said that.

601
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,520
You just have to eat less calories.

602
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,680
That's where personal trainer cooking comes into play.

603
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,040
Personal trainer cooking, mama?

604
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,320
No, personal trainer cooking and then they'll, you know, give you recipe ideas and stuff

605
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,640
like that and then somehow, you know, your being fat will be attributed to your not being

606
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,280
good at math and that's where personal training math will come into play.

607
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
No!

608
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,440
I knew that was the reason why I was fat.

609
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,640
Um, AcidicVampire in chat says, so Nintendo is releasing this but not Mother 3.

610
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Hmm.

611
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
Jerks.

612
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
I know.

613
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Just kidding, I love Nintendo.

614
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Well, is Mother 3 gonna get you in shape?

615
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,760
No, I don't think so.

616
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Think of the greater good.

617
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Think of the children.

618
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,720
Yes, no, would, would soccer moms be interested in Mother 3?

619
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I don't think so.

620
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Probably not.

621
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,680
But a personalized health coach?

622
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,840
That's, that's like what every soccer mom prays for before they go to bed.

623
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Yeah.

624
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
So, we'll see.

625
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,560
Well, um, there's some pretty cool news.

626
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,440
This week they announced that there's gonna be a sequel to Boom Blocks coming out, Boom

627
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,360
Blocks Bash Party.

628
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,800
It's gonna have some additional levels and some other fun stuff.

629
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,920
But what's also kinda neat is they announced- That sounds really close to Boom Blocks Bachelor

630
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Party.

631
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,720
Now that would make that game a hell of a lot more interesting, wouldn't it?

632
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,660
Um, yes, it would.

633
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,520
Too bad it's not gonna happen that way.

634
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,600
But apparently there's also something else that's interesting about it.

635
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,860
It's not gonna have friend codes.

636
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,840
There will be the ability to download and upload new levels and rate others, other people's

637
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,040
works.

638
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:28,360
And there will not be any additional security measures as far as friend's codes go.

639
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,680
But then again, this is an EA game, so, um, you know, maybe they're gonna have that stupid

640
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,640
break to sign up for, like, EA servers or something like that.

641
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,760
But still though, that's not friend's codes, and, um, that's pretty cool.

642
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,120
It's interesting it's taken this long for somebody to finally defy the friend code system.

643
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,120
I didn't- you know, I think a lot of us thought it was impossible, that if you wanted to do

644
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,260
the online Nintendo thing, you had to do friend's codes.

645
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,080
I think what makes this story notable is not necessarily who or what game is doing it,

646
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,120
but the whole fact that it can be done.

647
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Yes.

648
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,960
And the other thing that's interesting, you might remember that there was that rumor before

649
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,280
that there was gonna be a major game that would not use friend codes.

650
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Here it is.

651
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,780
Boom Blocks is a major game?

652
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
It actually is.

653
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,380
It is a pretty major game.

654
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,880
It sold really well, the first one, and it's been a pretty fun puzzle game.

655
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,520
I'm telling you though, the puzzle games need some tits in them.

656
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,320
It's- they would- Like Gals Panic!

657
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
No, no, no, no, no.

658
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
I know I've gotten into this on the show before.

659
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Gals Panic I fully approve of.

660
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Me too.

661
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,520
But not all puzzle games need tits in it.

662
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,140
If you will remember, Bubble Bath Babes, not a good puzzle game.

663
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Nobody bought it.

664
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,200
But it was a start.

665
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,600
You know, Rome wasn't built in a day.

666
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:46,740
They tried, and you know, I don't know why that was never further explored, but you know,

667
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,920
why did Miss Nude World have to stop at 96?

668
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,580
I know.

669
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,780
And remember in Leisure Suit Larry, they came out with one like a couple years back?

670
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,080
Like I thought that did pretty well, didn't it?

671
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
No.

672
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
How did the Leisure Suit Larry do?

673
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
I don't know.

674
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,080
But I thought that was like a-

675
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
But they are making another one.

676
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Cult franchise or something.

677
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Really?

678
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Yeah.

679
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
Wow.

680
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,800
It's just- it's on hold right now because Sierra, which is part of the Vindi Universal-

681
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:17,240
well, the Vindi Universal got bought up by Activision, and you know, all their properties

682
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,060
are kind of being sold off and redirected, so.

683
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,060
It's still in the works.

684
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:28,720
I mean, it's supposed to be- well, right now I think we had it dated for April, but I don't

685
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,760
think it's going to come out in April, but probably this year.

686
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,200
And it's Leisure Suit Larry's box office bust.

687
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
Okay.

688
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,080
Because see, this is the little, you know, Larry, and he has to help his uncle, Larry,

689
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,880
who's the original Leisure Suit Larry, and they're in Hollywood, and, oh, it's funny!

690
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,880
And there's like, cartoony women with big boobs, and-

691
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
That'll have sex with him eventually.

692
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
They get drunk-

693
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,760
Let's find an audio clip of that song from Miss World, Nude 96.

694
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,720
I know we used to have it years ago on this show.

695
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,440
Yeah, we've played it before.

696
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,240
I know, it's been years.

697
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,760
It fits the mood so well, too, for a puzzle game.

698
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,920
Anyhow, here's a puzzle game that's going to be coming to WiiWare, it's Bubble Bobble

699
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
on WiiWare.

700
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,100
I love Bubble Bobble.

701
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,000
No word yet if it's going to have a level 30 bug that you can't find the boss in it,

702
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,240
but actually what's kind of interesting about it, it's been, I guess, published in Famitsu

703
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,440
Magazine, and the game looks like it's gotten a bit of an upgrade, it looks like the graphics

704
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,920
are, you know, this doesn't look like a port of the arcade, and certainly not the old NES

705
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,360
version, so when we say Bubble Bobble's coming to WiiWare, I'm not talking about just a port

706
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,140
of the NES game, it looks like some newer version of Bubble Bobble made specifically

707
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
for WiiWare.

708
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,520
And, the NES game pissed me off, especially when you have that special, was it level 99

709
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,320
that you had to do something special to get to the levels beyond that?

710
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,480
Well, here's the interesting thing, it's going to be 400 stages in this new WiiWare version,

711
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,640
it's a full, it's going to have a full recreation of the original Bubble Bobble, some higher

712
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,980
difficulty levels if you are so inclined.

713
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,760
Here's the other cool thing though, apparently the new WiiWare one, four player local co-op,

714
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,280
because you might remember the original was only two, and a brand new enemy.

715
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Just one.

716
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,240
Just one, but a brand new enemy.

717
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,940
Apparently there's going to be download content for this game as well, 200 points a pop for

718
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,480
the download content, no word though how much the game itself is going to cost, I imagine

719
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
probably like 800.

720
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
Four million dollars!

721
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,840
So, but yeah, the download content will be 50 additional stages of high difficulty.

722
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Wow.

723
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,280
And a unique boss character in each one, ooh!

724
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,660
I think that they should go all out with this, release an external peripheral that you can

725
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,200
attach to the Wii via USB, and it would be a bubble blowing machine, so that as you're

726
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,680
playing the game, you know, it would blow bubbles at you.

727
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,840
I've seen those in home, on PlayStation 3, like have you seen this, like in the, randomly

728
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,000
in the mall on home, there's bubble blowing machines, for no particular reason, they're

729
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
just sitting there in the middle of the mall.

730
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,280
I think like every time you blow a bubble in the game, they should blow another bubble

731
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,960
out at you, I mean that would be kind of funny.

732
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
That would be pretty awesome.

733
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,640
That would be very immersive if you did that.

734
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,920
That's like a whole like 4D type of gaming I don't think has been explored yet.

735
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,320
Like Bubble Bobble featuring real bubbles.

736
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,400
It's like smell-o-vision, but better, I'd say.

737
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,240
You need to patent that idea, Loki.

738
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Quick.

739
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
That's alright.

740
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,080
I don't think that I'm really going to get my feelings hurt if someone actually releases

741
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
a bubble blowing machine.

742
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,800
Of course then, the bubble blowing machine, it breaks after 30 bubbles.

743
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,160
That's the downside to it.

744
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
That's ridiculous.

745
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Very limited.

746
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,840
Well, Nintendo revealed their launch schedule for the second quarter of 2000.

747
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
I have to read this comment.

748
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,400
I know I've been reading this guy a lot tonight, but the stuff he's been saying is funny.

749
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,280
Acidic Vampire says, Bubbles are fabulous.

750
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,240
Makes me feel like Amy Adams in Enchanted.

751
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,640
Or Glenda the Good Witch.

752
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
Nevermind.

753
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
Yeah.

754
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
I get it.

755
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Alright.

756
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Read the damn next story.

757
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Alright.

758
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,120
Well anyways, not really, I mean, I guess the second quarter, but everything that they've

759
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,280
announced so far for 2009.

760
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Not a big surprise.

761
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,800
Japan, they've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

762
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:16,000
You know, they have a sequel to, well, what they call over there Famicom Wars, which is

763
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Advance Wars over here.

764
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,120
DS2 is coming out sometime in, you know, 2009.

765
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,800
There's going to be a Tomodachi collection that's coming out in 2009.

766
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,400
New Picross game, it's coming out in March.

767
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,920
Mario & Luigi RPG 3, which is scheduled to come out over there.

768
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,440
Oh finally, an interesting sounding game.

769
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,520
February 11th.

770
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,520
And then on the Wii, of course they've got their new play control games, Mario Power

771
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,040
Tennis coming out, actually it's already come out over there.

772
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,280
That was January 15th.

773
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,040
This week there's another code R, which is Trace Memory is what they called it over here

774
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,400
on the DS, but that's on the Wii now.

775
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,320
New play control Metroid Prime.

776
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,560
Also Pikmin 2, Metroid Prime is coming out in a couple weeks there, and Pikmin 2 in March.

777
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Wii Sports Resort sometime in the spring, of course that's going to be over here as

778
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,160
well.

779
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,080
Sin and Punishment 2, of course sometime this year.

780
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:29,600
Endless Ocean 2, Hoshi no Kirby, Lion Attack Heroes, that's a weird name, Chibi-Robo,

781
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,520
they're going to do a new play control for that in Metroid Prime 2 as well.

782
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,920
And then they have some really weird names, oh Cosmic Walker, I guess that's a space version

783
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,580
of Endless Ocean, you're kind of space walking.

784
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:49,080
And then Dynamic Zen, Spurn Smashers, and Punch Out.

785
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,480
So that's interesting.

786
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,520
That's one game that had a lot of people excited previously was Punch Out, the new one.

787
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,360
Sometime it's going to be coming out.

788
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,840
And then of course in the US, some of the stuff that's already been announced, Fire

789
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,960
Emblem, Shadow Dragon, that's going to be coming out in a couple weeks, Pokemon Platinum

790
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,280
in March, Personal Trainer Walking, remember on the DS, that might go in with that whole

791
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,400
rumor there that that's actually going to come out over here, that update, coming out

792
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,560
sometime in 2009.

793
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,000
Rhythm Heaven coming out sometime in 2009, actually early April for that one.

794
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,360
Mario and Luigi RPG 3 coming out at some point, I'm going to guess probably May for that.

795
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,440
How long does it freakin' take to localize a game, Rhythm Heaven's not coming out until

796
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
April?

797
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,360
They were teasing that one at PAX last year, they were playing that.

798
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:50,400
And then the DSi sometime spring or summer of 2009, so that April rumor might actually

799
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,660
come true.

800
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,480
And then on the Wii, we've got Mario Power Tennis coming out in March as well as Pikmin.

801
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,880
Those are both coming out actually I think the same day.

802
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,840
Wii Sports Resort sometime in the first half of the year, Punch Out also in the first half

803
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:11,920
of the year, so probably Wii Sports, I'm going to try to guess here, maybe April and Punch

804
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,400
Out May or June, or maybe both June.

805
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,680
And then Sin and Punishment 2 sometime in 2009, which looks awesome.

806
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:29,320
And then of course in Europe, they're getting Rhythm Paradise over there, which, same game.

807
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,000
Walk With Me, do you know your walking routine?

808
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,760
Which comes with two activity meters.

809
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,000
At least it wasn't Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me, do you know your fire walking routine?

810
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,920
They're getting Mario and Luigi RPG as well, Pokemon Platinum sometime in the first half

811
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
of the year.

812
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Who killed Laura Palmer?

813
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,600
You better moonwalk to find out!

814
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,760
Kirby Superstar Ultra is also coming out over there, and then DSI Hardware sometime spring

815
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,840
or summer.

816
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,240
And then of course they're getting almost the same stuff as far as the play control

817
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
games.

818
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,600
Pikmin coming out February, that's surprising that they get Pikmin way before us.

819
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,360
Mario Power Tennis is coming out in March.

820
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Fire Walk With Me!

821
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,560
Punch Out, stop it!

822
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,400
Punch Out in the first half of the year, new play control Pikmin in the first half of the

823
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
year.

824
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,320
Wii Sports Resort is coming out in 2009, right in the first half, and Sin and Punishment

825
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
2.

826
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,040
Another code R, so they're getting another code, and Endless Ocean 2 also coming out

827
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
over here.

828
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,880
I'm guessing anything that will probably have some more stuff that's unannounced.

829
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,720
Obviously they haven't announced what they're going to be talking about yet.

830
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:48,640
E3, and just a thought, probably not going to be interesting.

831
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
I don't know.

832
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
I guess there's a couple interesting games in there.

833
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,560
Unless they announce Excite Truck 2, in which case I will give them, you know, I will apologize

834
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,520
for everything I've said.

835
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,720
But unless there's an Excite Truck 2, you know, that's really the only stipulation.

836
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,240
Excite Truck 2, or they can get the hell out.

837
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:12,440
Well one game that you might notice is missing from Nintendo's upcoming release calendar,

838
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,320
and boy I hate covering this story.

839
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,480
File this in the bin of things that we don't really think we ought to cover on this show,

840
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,400
but I kind of feel like we have to.

841
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,680
Do you remember Bob?

842
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,600
Bob was the guy that locked himself in a room in his 100-day protest in an effort to get

843
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,680
a development kit for his game, Bob's Game.

844
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,080
And he aborted his protest, I don't know, so many days into it because I guess he couldn't

845
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,520
take it anymore, and basically destroyed his room was the grand finale of the protest.

846
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,080
And no, Nintendo never sent him a kit.

847
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,400
Well, some of the audio you're going to be hearing now in the background there is actually

848
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:54,200
some video of them defacing property at Nintendo World in New York City.

849
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,440
That's right, that's how they decided to get back at Nintendo for not sending Bob a development

850
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,800
kit is that he got some of his friends together who for some strange reason looked like a

851
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,560
bunch of foreign tourists that would probably have recruited Bob in the very beginning of

852
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
the video.

853
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
Yeah, I saw him.

854
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,960
Doesn't he look like a tool?

855
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,520
He just, he does just kind of, he does, yeah, he just, he looks like an asshole.

856
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
I mean, honestly.

857
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,720
I don't know.

858
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,680
But um, you just, yeah, you see these girls are going into the Nintendo World store and

859
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,000
everybody's filming things going on here, I don't know why they didn't call security,

860
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,640
but they take posters to the side of the store that say Bob's Game, and they end up, I don't

861
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,280
know, handing out flyers to all these people just interrupting, being generally rude.

862
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:44,400
They slip in business cards into a bunch of the different games, they put mock boxes up

863
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,960
onto the shelves, and they just basically, generally harass people.

864
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,020
And just act like assholes, really, if Jamie was here, she'd be having a field day right

865
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,280
now, honestly, she'd just, oh my god, I can't even imagine.

866
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:03,040
Let me add that, okay, for one, Bob's Game, great that you made a game all by yourself,

867
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,640
congratulations, you know what, lots of people have done that, and they have taken, you know,

868
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,040
their game online, whatever, and you know, we don't really hear too much about it, but

869
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,720
the fact is, just because you made a game by yourself does not mean it needs to be played.

870
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,320
Look at that, he just dumped a bunch of business cards on the floor.

871
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,240
Oh, what an ass.

872
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,200
I gotta know what the chat room thinks about this.

873
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,520
And then let me say the other thing, his game does not look good, and trust me, he doesn't

874
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,280
seem that creative.

875
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,120
Bob's Game, really, is that what you're gonna call it, Bob's Game, I'm sorry, I know there

876
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,240
is a game actually coming out by Graffiti Entertainment, they're the ones publishing

877
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,600
it, it was a game called Black Siegel, I forget what it was originally called, but it was

878
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:56,200
a homebrew DS Game Boy Advance game that they finally did get a publisher because they couldn't

879
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,580
publish it on their own, and yeah, it's not one person putting it out, but you know what,

880
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,760
they went through the proper channels and got their game published, because he doesn't

881
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,660
need to publish this game himself, he just needs to find a publisher to do it for him,

882
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,840
and you know, if no one's picking it up, gee I wonder why, and so they're actually going

883
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,220
through channels that may be a really small company, but they're gonna get it published,

884
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,040
and I think his game could probably get published by the same company if he really tried, but

885
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,880
he's an asshole, and honestly, at first I felt bad for him because he couldn't get a

886
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,640
development kit, I don't give a shit now, I think he's an asshole, and I fucking, his

887
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,560
game looks like shit, it looks like something made with the old RPG maker, and it really

888
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,600
does not look good at all, I would not buy this game, especially after all this shit

889
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
he's been pulling.

890
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:49,560
SSJ100Matt in our chat says, fucking douchebag, even if his game came to the DS, I wouldn't

891
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
buy it.

892
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,200
GS68 says, for fuck's sake, look at Pixel or Nijoro or whatever, they don't get paid

893
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,520
for their shit and they don't care, and says this should be an OLR stupid award of the

894
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,400
year, and Acidic Vampire says he's being a whiny little bitch.

895
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,040
He pretty much is, what is he hoping to accomplish by doing all this?

896
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
For real!

897
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,640
I mean, do you think anybody at Nintendo is gonna, at Nintendo, like executives, are actually

898
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
gonna hear about this?

899
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,680
Oh my, you're doing all of this stuff, we should publish, or, you know, make, put your

900
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
game out.

901
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,680
Oh, I know!

902
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,680
It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.

903
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.

904
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,640
He's probably gonna release it as a ROM or something, and still no one's gonna download

905
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
it.

906
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
He put the video on the internet.

907
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,880
Do you know how stupid that is?

908
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,520
Because like now there's video out there of you essentially vandalizing the property and

909
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,740
making the scene here at the Nintendo World Store or whatever.

910
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,740
You know?

911
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,760
You don't think they might come after you?

912
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,800
I want you, Miyamoto, to come out with like the Master Sword and just like chop him in

913
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,800
half.

914
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
That'd be awesome.

915
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,280
I'm sorry, this guy does not need any more of our time, and to be honest, I don't give

916
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,600
a shit if his game ever gets published.

917
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,680
And really, you know, release it as in the homebrew community or something like that,

918
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,900
because you know what?

919
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,520
I don't think anyone's gonna give a shit.

920
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,400
The game doesn't look that great, okay, it has all this, you know, gameplay and stuff

921
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,800
in it, but it doesn't look that good.

922
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,920
It really doesn't.

923
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,080
There's no reason that this should be published.

924
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,280
Gameguru in chat says, Bob's been blackballed from the video game industry, and you know

925
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,280
what?

926
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,320
I think, I think the blogs need to stop giving this guy any attention.

927
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,320
At all.

928
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
We should too, so okay.

929
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,080
Go ahead.

930
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,120
He's a dick face, and he's a crappy game developer.

931
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
The end of the story.

932
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Let's move on.

933
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,120
I just, I just want to say though, I just want to say, I want to put a request out there

934
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,200
to the OL Army.

935
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,100
If you see this guy getting any more coverage on blogs out there or whatever, please leave

936
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,320
a comment, email the blog, and ask them to please stop giving this guy attention.

937
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
It starts here.

938
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
No more.

939
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,280
Bob Chat is banned from Orange Lawns Radio.

940
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,320
I don't ever want to hear about this stupid idiot again, and I hope, I hope to hell his

941
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,360
thing gets him in trouble and whatever.

942
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,280
And if you see him on the street, you should kick him in the junk.

943
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,720
I think so.

944
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:23,320
So the OLR banishment of Bob begins here, and now with our favorite segment.

945
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,840
Loki would you like to start us off with the FUs of the week tonight?

946
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Yes.

947
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,800
I guess I FU'd Bob because he's annoying, and honestly I watched that video clip today

948
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,560
and I was like, oh my god, really?

949
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,880
Are you guys doing this?

950
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,800
I mean, you really think this is going to work?

951
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,040
You just feel awkward watching it, don't you?

952
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,800
It does feel awkward, and I feel-

953
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,400
Like those girls have no idea what they're doing.

954
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,600
And it's not hurting Nintendo at all, it's pissing off the people that have to work in

955
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,560
that damn store, they have to clean up this stupid mess, because you're a stupid game

956
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,800
that's never going to get published, and is not any good anyways.

957
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,800
So what?

958
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,680
You're one person that you made a game, oh my god, you're the first person on earth to

959
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,680
make a game before.

960
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,760
There's a lot of people that make games by themselves, you know, and they put it out

961
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
on the Atari and shit like that?

962
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,520
That's how the whole fucking game industry worked, and it's how it became.

963
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,700
Just because you're one dude that makes a game doesn't mean that Nintendo has to give

964
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:24,840
you a dev kit because you think you're awesome, that you did with one person what a whole

965
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,280
team of people would do.

966
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,280
But guess what?

967
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,440
The game made with a team of people is probably a whole lot better, and it will get published.

968
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,160
Your game, not so much.

969
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,600
I concur.

970
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
That's it?

971
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,800
Nothing else to say about your personal life?

972
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,840
Oh, and those burger shot burgers aren't that good anymore.

973
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,440
I'm over- So F you today.

974
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,140
F you, burger shot burgers.

975
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,560
My F you of the week goes to the Super Bowl for cutting into tonight's live ratings.

976
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,360
That's always a bummer.

977
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,180
And then I give an F you to phantom pains I have.

978
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,520
Even after all those surgeries and stuff and scare I had last year, I really don't want

979
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,720
to have pains anymore, so it kind of sucks.

980
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,800
Because then it always freaks me out that it's worst case scenario, like I've got cancer

981
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,160
or something, and it's just, it's stupid, and I just, I just want to be healthy.

982
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,160
For once.

983
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,160
You'll be healthy.

984
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,160
I hate it.

985
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
I know.

986
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,400
Rice Princess, your F yous.

987
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,800
Fuck you to Lieutenant Felix Gaeta.

988
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,120
I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but you just pissed off a whole lot of people,

989
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,440
and I hope you fucking die.

990
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,120
I feel so sorry for that actor.

991
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,240
No, I'm sure he's a great actor.

992
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,640
He did a lot of voice work for Ronda.

993
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,280
You know there's people that don't know how to tell the difference, though.

994
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,280
Yeah, I know.

995
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,280
I'm not, like, crazy.

996
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,680
I just don't like him as a character, but I hope he fucking gets airlocks or some shit.

997
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,440
That must be, like, the first gay guy you've, like, really just wanted to beat up.

998
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Yeah, I do.

999
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
Oh my god.

1000
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
I would never be his hag.

1001
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,880
I wouldn't be like, go fuck yourself out of an airlock.

1002
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,880
I don't know.

1003
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,960
But yeah, I'm mad at him, so.

1004
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,960
Alright.

1005
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,760
Uh, does Silent Nathan have any F yous of the week, or is he sleeping?

1006
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,240
No, he's shaking, no, he's shaking his head, though.

1007
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,240
A simple no.

1008
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,240
Alright.

1009
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,240
That's it.

1010
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,320
Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, you don't see Aaron from Snake 360 pulling that crap.

1011
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
That's true.

1012
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,160
I mean, there's so many great ways for poking on there.

1013
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,160
He's nice.

1014
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
I'm serious, though.

1015
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,880
That guy is not the only guy that's programmed a game by himself.

1016
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,240
Hell, there's been people that have made a, I think, a whole anime movie by themselves,

1017
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,280
and you know, here are them bitching and stuff, and their movie gets made, and it looks fucking

1018
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,280
awesome.

1019
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,240
And I do want to clarify for the chatroom, because they were asking, even though Bob

1020
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,080
is banned from OLR, you can still say Bobby Blackwolf.

1021
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,080
That's okay.

1022
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,600
You can say it.

1023
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,840
It's part of a bigger word.

1024
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,900
It's just Bob as far as Bob's game, and you know.

1025
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,400
There might be a CEO or something of some company named Bob, and that's alright.

1026
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,040
And if Bob, Bobby Blackwolf makes a game, you can call it Bobby's Game.

1027
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,040
That's right.

1028
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,600
You can shorten it to Bob's Game, but you know, that doesn't really work.

1029
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,860
I would like to see Bobby Blackwolf put out a game called Bob's Game, and get it put on

1030
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,200
Xbox Live, and then sue the other Bob.

1031
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,200
That's what I would like to see happen.

1032
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
That'd be awesome.

1033
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,240
I'm gonna make an email to Bobby later on.

1034
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,200
Um, oh my god, LittleBigPlanet.

1035
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,920
You should do something making fun of Bob's Game on LittleBigPlanet.

1036
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,920
There you go.

1037
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,920
That'll be fun.

1038
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
We'll see.

1039
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,080
Um, I wanted to say also, AcidicVampire, sometimes our chatroom joins in on the FUs, and I don't

1040
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,880
always read in the mall, because then we'd be here for a day, but this just made me think

1041
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,560
of something that Rice Princess and I were talking about the other day.

1042
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,560
AcidicVampire in chat says, F you to those damn Snuggie commercials.

1043
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:35,000
It's a rope backwards!

1044
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:42,760
No, I, okay, for those that don't know what the Snuggie is, we have to talk about this

1045
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,680
for a minute, because this is important.

1046
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,680
The hell with video games.

1047
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,080
I want one of these for when I play video games.

1048
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,720
Buy a robe and turn it backwards.

1049
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,720
Done.

1050
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:57,000
The Snuggie is a blanket, but it has sleeves on it, because you know how sometimes like

1051
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,640
your arms are just like, they're under the blanket, and if you want to get some, then

1052
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,640
your arms get cold.

1053
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,640
Hypothermia.

1054
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:13,200
So the Snuggie fixes those problems, and I want one, because I get cold really easy.

1055
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,360
You're what's wrong with this nation.

1056
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,120
Yeah, it's so funny.

1057
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,360
When I saw the commercial the first time, I was like, what a great idea, but I'm not

1058
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,800
going to buy anything I see on TV, I'll just wait until it's a target.

1059
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,640
You know what else is a great idea?

1060
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,920
It's called a robe.

1061
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,920
Guess what?

1062
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
It also covers your back and your front.

1063
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,720
You make it sound like I'm always sitting around my house naked.

1064
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,800
I have clothes on, but sometimes you need an extra layer.

1065
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Exactly.

1066
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
A sweater.

1067
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:41,080
Hey, I wore a robe with these clothes on right now because not only was it warm, it was comfortable.

1068
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,080
And guess what?

1069
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,240
It's not a fucking Snuggie that probably costs a lot of money.

1070
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,040
And they ripped off the Snuggie off of some other guy that had something very...

1071
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,040
The slinket.

1072
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,040
The slinket, yeah.

1073
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,040
Well, then I'll buy a slinket.

1074
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,960
I don't give a shit what the name is, I just want a blanket with sleeves.

1075
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,960
I think it's a brilliant idea.

1076
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,520
Did you see the what the fuck blanket, the parody?

1077
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,520
Yes, I saw that.

1078
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,520
You saw that, right?

1079
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,520
You posted on your live show or whatever.

1080
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
Yeah, that's right.

1081
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,000
That's like the best thing ever.

1082
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,120
And while we're at it, cashforgold.com is a complete ripoff, okay?

1083
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,600
If anyone can't figure that out, I mean, yeah, you send us your gold first, then I'll tell

1084
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,000
you how much it's worth.

1085
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,480
Yeah, we'll wait for you and everything.

1086
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,480
We'll give you a top...

1087
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,480
Really?

1088
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,480
Thanks.

1089
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,480
We'll give you a top dollar for it.

1090
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,920
Oh, and by the way, if you want your gold back, it's already melted down, so too bad.

1091
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,360
Tired of using regular blankets like this asshole?

1092
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,640
Do they somehow destroy your heating bills?

1093
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,160
Do you struggle when trying to figure out how to put them on?

1094
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,040
Are mundane tasks like answering the phone now impossibly difficult?

1095
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,600
Well morons, now there's hope with the new what the fuck blanket, the blanket that'll

1096
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,120
ruin your sex life.

1097
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,120
That's on YouTube.

1098
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,720
She looks like a monk.

1099
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,600
I think I actually posted a reply on Rice Princess' live journal with a picture of one

1100
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,800
of the happy, happy cultists, because it just reminded me, because they talk about how it

1101
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,200
looks like a cult robe or whatever.

1102
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:05,960
Somebody actually replied, my parents bought one for everyone in the household.

1103
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,560
That shit is on the ground in the corner.

1104
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,200
I like that idea.

1105
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,200
Give it to me.

1106
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,200
Don't let it sit in the corner.

1107
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,200
I was like, you should give it to Rob.

1108
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,200
He'd use it, I guess.

1109
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,200
All right.

1110
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,080
Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.

1111
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,080
Sorry for the...

1112
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,520
The only thing that I don't like about the robe, though, is it conducts a lot of static

1113
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,100
electricity, like a lot of static electricity, and it's not funny.

1114
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,280
And what about the ShamWow?

1115
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,840
That guy's annoying, too.

1116
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,200
But that's an actual product that's good.

1117
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
I mean...

1118
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
Well, I've never used it.

1119
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,200
I don't know.

1120
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Whatever happened to Sillet Bang?

1121
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
That's...

1122
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Sillet Bang?

1123
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,200
Where's the magic bullet?

1124
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,200
It's like orange glow or something.

1125
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,200
All right.

1126
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,200
Enough.

1127
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,200
Enough.

1128
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,200
Games.

1129
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,200
Video games.

1130
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Games.

1131
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,200
Games.

1132
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,200
Games.

1133
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,200
Anyways, Gears of War PC.

1134
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,240
I don't know, because there was a little problem.

1135
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:03,320
Apparently, there is a Verisign code that has expired.

1136
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,880
And because it expired, the game will not work past the date January 28th.

1137
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,320
So if you want to play it, you have to set your date back to before the 28th, and then

1138
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,080
it'll work just fine.

1139
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,560
Epic is aware of the situation, and is working on a way to fix it.

1140
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,000
So soon, it'll be fixed.

1141
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,280
But right now, it's a minor inconvenience.

1142
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,080
That's a pretty fucking big inconvenience, actually.

1143
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,480
What if you just got this game, like, in the bargain bin at a store or something, and now

1144
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,480
you can't even play the damn thing?

1145
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,800
Well, then you would go online, read about it, and set your date back to before the 28th.

1146
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,760
What if I'm not smart enough to do that?

1147
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,440
Well, then, too bad.

1148
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,320
Then you go back and take it back to Walmart and go, it's game no work, and then they'll

1149
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,320
give you your money back.

1150
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,320
Can you give me a Snuggie instead?

1151
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
That's right.

1152
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,760
Maybe I would take back my copies of Gears of War PC and get a Snuggie.

1153
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,440
They should have a Gears of War Snuggie.

1154
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,960
They should have a Gears of War Snuggie.

1155
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
That would be awful.

1156
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,920
They should have Snuggies that have, like, patterns on them, like, Sesame Street and

1157
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,920
all this.

1158
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,920
Sesame Street?

1159
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,440
You know, all the stuff from, you know, when we were kids.

1160
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
Yes.

1161
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,440
Totally.

1162
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,120
Or you could make your own out of a blanket.

1163
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,680
But with sleeves, Loki, you're missing the point.

1164
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,320
It needs sleeves.

1165
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,760
I have an idea.

1166
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,880
Why don't you get pajamas?

1167
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,880
Or a jacket.

1168
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,880
Or a robe.

1169
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,320
Pajamas make me feel old.

1170
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,560
Or like some socks.

1171
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,720
What are you saying about pajamas, okay?

1172
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,160
I have a pair of flannel pajamas that are fucking comfortable, okay?

1173
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,240
And they're warm.

1174
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,240
And they're warm.

1175
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Alright, look.

1176
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,440
Gears of War didn't just make the mistake of not making a Snuggie out of their collection

1177
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,200
or flubbing the PC version of the game.

1178
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:47,400
Apparently, also, the Gears of War 2 Gold Lancer went up on Xbox Live for everybody

1179
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,400
earlier this week.

1180
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,080
This was something you were only supposed to get if you actually got the collector's

1181
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,920
edition of Gears of War 2.

1182
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,400
And when I say Gold Lancer, I don't mean a car.

1183
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
It's the type of gun.

1184
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,920
It's the type of gun that you use in the game.

1185
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,980
Although it would be pretty awesome if you suddenly could use cars to run over the monsters.

1186
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,480
And here's the other interesting thing about it.

1187
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,960
According to a representative for Xbox Live, everybody who actually got the Gold Lancer

1188
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,920
during the period that it was available, they're gonna have the item removed from the game

1189
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,480
in an upcoming fix.

1190
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,480
Right.

1191
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,160
Just like they said the Fable 2 exclusive code or whatever for people to have the collector's

1192
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
edition.

1193
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,560
We're gonna find out who doesn't have the collector's edition.

1194
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,600
We're gonna take it away from you.

1195
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,560
Yeah, that never happened.

1196
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:34,600
Apparently, also, the way they fixed this temporarily, they put the Gold Lancer...

1197
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,760
I mean, they weren't able to remove the Gold Lancer from Xbox Live Marketplace.

1198
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:44,360
Apparently, it was still there late last week, but it was being charged a price of 99,999

1199
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,360
Microsoft points.

1200
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,360
They do that.

1201
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,360
They do that.

1202
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,720
They did that before because they actually have that available and then there's also

1203
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,880
some maps that were for Call of Duty World at War that were exclusive.

1204
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,200
This was when they first launched that Xbox.com where you can actually queue up downloads

1205
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,380
and stuff like that.

1206
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,080
They had a way that if you go through...

1207
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,800
Say you downloaded this Gold Lancer or whatever, you can go back into your history, find out

1208
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,920
what the item or the URL is for the item posted on the internet, then anybody can go download

1209
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,960
it or go to that link.

1210
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:20,360
If it happened to be a free item, you'll be able to download it onto your system or something

1211
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
like that.

1212
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Something that would be exclusive.

1213
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,000
They did this originally with...

1214
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,600
There was also the Banjo-Kazooie thing, the Xbox Live Arcade game that was available only

1215
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,600
for a limited time.

1216
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,680
However, they caught that too and they also put it, like, 99,999 as the amount for it.

1217
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:39,280
You have to wonder if anybody spends the $150,000 or whatever it would take to get it anyway.

1218
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,680
Well, there are people that buy stupid iPhone programs that cost thousands of dollars just

1219
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,840
to have a stupid gem on there.

1220
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,840
So...

1221
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
Wow.

1222
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
That's pretty sad.

1223
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,840
Yeah.

1224
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
I don't know.

1225
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,800
I wish I had disposable income like that, but I don't.

1226
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,800
You don't?

1227
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,420
Well, if you did, then you could probably buy some of these new Xbox Live Arcade games

1228
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,120
coming from Square Enix.

1229
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,320
Of course, we talked about Yosamin Live, their puzzle game that's coming out with a little

1230
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
angry...

1231
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,240
I don't know, objects in there.

1232
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,400
They have a little slime object that's kind of angry looking and a cross that looks angry.

1233
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,120
It's a whole lot of angry stuff.

1234
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,840
Actually, it's like, you know, like in Super Mario Brothers how everything has a smiley

1235
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,840
face on it?

1236
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,480
Everything has an angry face in this game, so that's interesting.

1237
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,120
Some other games, of course, that are going to be coming as well.

1238
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,740
The Crystal Defenders, which, of course, was originally a mobile game.

1239
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,680
Some other stuff...

1240
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,560
There are some other games that they're working on too that I didn't really mention the titles

1241
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,600
for, though.

1242
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,880
But they do have a lot more ports coming to Xbox Live Arcade and Square Enix is going

1243
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,600
to start supporting it a little bit more.

1244
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
So that's cool.

1245
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,320
I don't really know what other games they have.

1246
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,440
They had a game a while back in Itremaster.

1247
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,440
That would be kind of neat.

1248
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Yeah, for Xbox Live.

1249
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,440
That would be fun, right?

1250
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
Yeah.

1251
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,380
I wonder if they're still making money on that.

1252
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,380
You know what I mean?

1253
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,380
Like the online version?

1254
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,380
Nah, I doubt it.

1255
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,400
I mean, it's kind of free money at this point if they do have anybody playing it.

1256
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,200
I mean, I'm sure it takes like one server to run the whole thing, but, you know, they

1257
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,400
could release that as like a $10 Xbox Live Arcade game, maybe when you have to charge

1258
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,960
a monthly fee and they still make a pretty penny off it.

1259
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,780
They had a game, and I can't remember what the hell it was called.

1260
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:21,000
It was, and I'm not even sure if it actually came out, but it was for, I think, the Playstation

1261
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
2.

1262
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,080
Might have been the Playstation 1.

1263
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:29,000
And it was on a demo disc that was, I think it was the Playstation 1 now, if I remember

1264
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
correctly.

1265
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,480
It was on a demo disc with like, I want to say, maybe if it had been Final Fantasy 7,

1266
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,680
there might have been some other stuff on there as well.

1267
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,480
But it was a street racing RPG.

1268
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,820
But I don't remember what it was called, though.

1269
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,160
But I remember it had, you know, like racing in it, and it was from Square Enix.

1270
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,160
I don't remember either.

1271
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,080
But that would be another cool game to bring out.

1272
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,080
Who knows?

1273
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,080
Who knows?

1274
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,520
And I'm sure there'll be some type of Final Fantasy milking at some point, which is not

1275
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
necessarily a bad thing.

1276
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,680
Well, they do have Crystal Defenders, which is a Final Fantasy game, so.

1277
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,680
Alright, I guess there is that.

1278
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:10,040
Hey, if you are downloading a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Marketplace for popular role-playing

1279
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,000
games, perhaps you've checked out some of the content for Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

1280
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,360
And Bethesda actually put out a list this week of what some of the top downloaded Oblivion

1281
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,920
content is.

1282
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,240
And funny enough, the top downloaded content is Wizard's Tower, is the number one most

1283
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,640
downloaded content that they have.

1284
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:32,280
Knights of the Nine is all the way down to number seven, Shivering Isles number eight.

1285
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,560
But what's interesting, I mean, because those are pretty expensive if I remember right,

1286
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,640
but what's interesting, remember all the shit that Bethesda used to get for the horse armor?

1287
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,880
Remember the horse armor download they put?

1288
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,920
Apparently that content, all it was, like where is all this other content I'm mentioning

1289
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,580
is like new levels, new areas to explore, new quests and stuff.

1290
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:54,440
Horse armor was just armor for your horse.

1291
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,080
And it was just a visual thing only, it did nothing special.

1292
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,360
Because yeah, so and they actually charged a lot of money for this.

1293
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,600
It was like, at the time, it was an insane amount, I don't remember how much was horse

1294
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,600
armor?

1295
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,600
It was like five bucks, I think.

1296
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,440
It was like five bucks for stupid armor for your horse.

1297
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,800
Well the thing is, that checks in at number nine.

1298
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,920
And they claim they still sell some horse armor every day.

1299
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,920
Wow.

1300
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,960
Still, even after all this time.

1301
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,560
Fighter's Stronghold is the dead last entry on the top ten list.

1302
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,960
You can get Elder Scrolls Oblivion the game of the year edition with the expansion on

1303
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
it.

1304
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,260
20 bucks.

1305
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,260
Not bad.

1306
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,160
I'm thinking about buying it again.

1307
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,600
For Playstation 3?

1308
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,600
Fuck that.

1309
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,600
Who knows?

1310
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Xbox 360.

1311
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
I didn't catch which system it was on.

1312
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,760
No, the game of the year edition is on both.

1313
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,080
So both of them are 20 bucks now.

1314
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,920
Fighter's Stronghold is dead last.

1315
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:49,600
Apparently though, that could be because this thing only ranks the bot download and pay

1316
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,600
for it.

1317
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,120
And Fighter's Stronghold was free for a little while, that's why I have it.

1318
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,400
So probably a lot of people grabbed it while it was free and they never needed to get it

1319
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,400
again.

1320
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,400
But was it an Xbox Magazine disc that actually has two of those on there that were paid download

1321
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,880
content for free?

1322
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,880
If you want them.

1323
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,960
I don't know if you still play Oblivion, but you know.

1324
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,760
There's just so much to do in Oblivion.

1325
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,000
I mean, god, even without the expansions, I felt like they could, I mean, literally

1326
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,840
you can just walk around the world and just walk into random ass dungeons and explore

1327
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
them.

1328
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,840
I mean, there was just so much in that game.

1329
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,840
I, it's crazy.

1330
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,280
I can't wait for the next one.

1331
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,840
It'd be crazy.

1332
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,160
So there you go.

1333
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,520
Still all that content for Oblivion is still popular today?

1334
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,060
Something that's popular, I think, is still Raiden.

1335
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:39,800
You may remember those as the wonderful top-down arcade shooter games.

1336
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:46,280
Well, Raiden Fighter Aces, I believe, came out in Japan, and it's rumored to be coming

1337
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,680
out over here as well.

1338
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,680
Raiden Fighter Aces actually is a collection of three different Raiden Fighter games.

1339
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,120
They have Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighter's

1340
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,080
Jet, all on one disc.

1341
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:08,800
Well, the rumors are that Zoo Games is actually publishing the game in the US for $29.99,

1342
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,680
and that's absolutely true, and it'll be coming out the first week of March.

1343
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,720
Also, Raiden 4 will be coming out around the same time, actually later in March.

1344
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,480
So a lot of good stuff for Raiden fans.

1345
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,920
And GS68 wants to clarify two things.

1346
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
He's saying Raiden.

1347
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,980
Raiden, Raiden, whatever.

1348
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:31,800
And Mortal Kombat kind of ruined it, because they called that one guy Raiden, forget it,

1349
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,920
and says all of this is Japanese-only, right?

1350
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,920
No.

1351
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:35,920
It's coming stateside.

1352
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,080
These are coming out in the US.

1353
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,080
And what platform?

1354
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,080
Xbox 360.

1355
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,560
There you go.

1356
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:46,360
And yeah, Raiden 4 will be coming out at the end of March.

1357
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,360
Nice.

1358
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,680
I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that are very interested in that.

1359
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,000
Also some folks interested in everything Banjo Kazooie related, and there's Banjo Tooie.

1360
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,880
Banjo Tooie is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, apparently a little later this

1361
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,880
year.

1362
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:06,560
Probably about 1,200 Microsoft points, although that hasn't been confirmed yet.

1363
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,220
But it is confirmed.

1364
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,520
It is coming out.

1365
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,400
It's slightly upped graphics and upped frame rate as well.

1366
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,640
And Stop and Swap is coming over.

1367
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,200
Apparently this is something from the Nintendo 64 days, where if you got some items in Banjo

1368
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,400
Kazooie, they will show up in Banjo Tooie as well.

1369
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,760
So not too big of a surprise, since I'm assuming the first one did pretty well for them, and

1370
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,760
the game was already done.

1371
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,400
They just have to do some upgrades and sell it all over again for $15, and people will

1372
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,400
buy it.

1373
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,680
Where there's horse armor, there's Banjo Tooie.

1374
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,080
Okay, maybe it's not that bad.

1375
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,080
But you know, there's a lot of people who love the Banjo series, and I'm sure excited

1376
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:49,480
to play it all over again with the updated graphics and widescreen and all that stuff.

1377
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,480
So good for them.

1378
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,200
Yeah, well, if you're not waiting for Banjo Tooie, there are some other things coming

1379
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,120
out this week.

1380
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,680
That might be something you want to pick up.

1381
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:04,200
I don't know, not a whole lot this week, unfortunately.

1382
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,560
Starting things off, let's see.

1383
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:12,320
We have, for the Wii, Rygar Battle of Argus.

1384
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,320
Yay.

1385
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:20,920
I don't know, it's a port of the Playstation 2 game, and then they've added some Colosseum

1386
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,280
levels or something like that.

1387
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,160
So yay, a port of something!

1388
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,360
That came out like, what, five years ago?

1389
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,440
Yeah, it was a while ago.

1390
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,800
So that'll be coming out.

1391
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:40,360
And then this week, I know there's some miscellaneous DS games, like some Imagine crap.

1392
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,560
Imagine, crapping.

1393
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:51,160
No, it's really pathetic, the lineup this week, I swear.

1394
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:55,440
And then, could that be because we have Street Fighter IV coming out the week after, or is

1395
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,440
that two weeks?

1396
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,440
It's two weeks.

1397
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,440
Yeah, two weeks.

1398
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,560
Actually, the week after would be Fear 2, and X-Planes.

1399
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,640
Oh, there's people definitely excited about that.

1400
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,640
That's for sure.

1401
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,640
Yeah.

1402
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:10,320
Street Fighter II is next week in Japan, but I'll get to that in a minute.

1403
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,600
Oh, are you done with the US states?

1404
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,960
This list that I'm looking at is not very accurate, it actually doesn't even have next

1405
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,960
week.

1406
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,960
It just skips over next week, that's how pathetic next week is.

1407
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:29,920
I'm trying to think if there's, I think Tenchu Z, or not Tenchu Z yet, Tenchu 4 on the Wii

1408
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,000
is coming out I believe as well, at least I can't remember if that got delayed or not.

1409
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,560
Yeah, so it's basically Tenchu or nothing.

1410
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:46,800
This whole January-February period is usually pretty slow for game releases.

1411
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,180
The Street Fighter IV thing is kind of a, I get the sense it's something Capcom is kind

1412
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,960
of trying out.

1413
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,160
Usually you don't see a lot of big, big games in this time frame, right?

1414
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,280
Actually, Capcom typically releases stuff in the first quarter.

1415
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,280
Interesting.

1416
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,680
Actually, this year they're releasing stuff first quarter and second quarter, which is

1417
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,480
good.

1418
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,440
But they are pretty smart to do so, because there's not much competition this time of

1419
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,440
year.

1420
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,600
Although this year there's pretty good stuff coming out.

1421
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,840
But yeah, not too much, this next week is really dead.

1422
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:20,600
So we'll wait for the week after that where we actually get into the meat of things, and

1423
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,440
it'll start picking up from there all the way through March.

1424
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,960
Alright, let's talk about Japanese release dates.

1425
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,920
Luckily it looks a little better over there for the Japanese release dates.

1426
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,920
On the Xbox 360, Burnout Paradise, the Ultimate Box set, makes this way, and I'm assuming

1427
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,600
that's just all the special download stuff we got here.

1428
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,120
It's the Burnout plus the ultimate party thing that they've got that's going to be a download

1429
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,120
next week.

1430
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,120
Basically all the extra crap.

1431
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,640
You can get that in Japan this week on February the 5th for the Xbox 360.

1432
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,220
Also, Midnight Club Los Angeles comes out on the 5th.

1433
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:55,120
If you head over to the place, it's racing fun on the Xbox 360 this week.

1434
01:06:55,120 --> 01:07:00,160
By the way, Street Fighter IV is next week, but I'll remind you about that next week.

1435
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,360
On the PlayStation 3, Burnout Paradise, the Ultimate Box also there, as well as Midnight

1436
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,360
Club Los Angeles.

1437
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,580
You also get Shaun White snowboarding, and Demon's Souls is a game that's coming out

1438
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,000
from Sony on the PlayStation 3.

1439
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,780
It's... what are you laughing at over there?

1440
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,400
And Demon's Souls you get.

1441
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,360
It's apparently a pretty big release.

1442
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,480
It's an RPG coming out.

1443
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,000
Demon's Souls!

1444
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,480
I sure... but... shut up.

1445
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,640
For that, I'm not going to tell you anything more about Demon's Souls.

1446
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,640
You'll just have to.

1447
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,640
It will forever be a mystery.

1448
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,640
Oh, no.

1449
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,640
No, please, Rob.

1450
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,640
Tells you about Demon's Souls.

1451
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,640
Well, it's an RPG made by Sony.

1452
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,640
I think it's pretty... alright.

1453
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,160
On the Nintendo Wii, another code R. Kyoku no Tobira is coming out from Nintendo.

1454
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,440
D-Terminal and AV-Cable.

1455
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,440
That's right.

1456
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,800
If you need a new AV-Cable, you can get that this week.

1457
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,280
Well, D-Terminal's pretty cool.

1458
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,160
I've been waiting for years for that to come out.

1459
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,160
Finally.

1460
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:57,160
Well, the D-Terminal's cool because, I mean, you know, if you want to hook it up to a PC

1461
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,120
monitor, that's the only way you can do it, really.

1462
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,200
I've got to say, though, this another code R game actually sounds kind of cool.

1463
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,400
Is this just Lost in Blue?

1464
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,920
No, it's just Trace Memory.

1465
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,160
Oh, it's Trace Memory.

1466
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,960
Oh, okay, because I got confused when I looked at the thing.

1467
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,960
This game actually sounds kind of cool.

1468
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,960
The first one was really slow.

1469
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,960
You know what's weird?

1470
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,960
I thought that game has been out for a while.

1471
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,960
No, it's just coming out of the game.

1472
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,840
At least I've seen it floating around for a while, but, you know, I could be wrong.

1473
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,840
I've been thinking of the DS version.

1474
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,840
I think you are.

1475
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,840
Yeah, I think you are.

1476
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,360
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, nothing.

1477
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,840
There's one game getting a price reduction, Momotaro Densetsu 16.

1478
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,840
That's it.

1479
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,400
And nothing else is new.

1480
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,680
Nintendo DS is a little different.

1481
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:37,180
There is some new stuff coming out, but it's mostly like covers and pouches and things

1482
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,180
like that.

1483
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,960
But there is a game called Destiny Links coming out from Bandai Namco, and it's an RPG, of

1484
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,960
course.

1485
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:50,560
And you get your character and you sail forth to Amazia, the island of happiness.

1486
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,080
That sounds like a destiny I want.

1487
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,080
I'm not making it up.

1488
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,800
Can't wait to get to Amazia.

1489
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,800
Amazia.

1490
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,920
I believe that's it.

1491
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,480
I'm trying to look at PSP really quick and see if there's anything there.

1492
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:10,920
Midnight Club LA Remix, Shaun White Snowboarding, and DJ Max Fever, by the way, is supposed

1493
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,920
to be coming out in the US.

1494
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,640
I think it did already hit the US, but it got delayed some places because of the snowstorms

1495
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,640
that were going on, right?

1496
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,280
Yeah, fucking ice storms.

1497
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,600
Some people got their hands on it.

1498
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,560
Hey, let's go to Europe real quick.

1499
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,840
Since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll go ahead and read the Europe dates for you.

1500
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:30,560
Now, see, Japan and the US were kind of slow, but Europe has a big week ahead.

1501
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,960
For February 6th, they're getting Burnout Paradise on the PC, Castlevania Order of Aclatia

1502
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,000
on the DS, Chrono Trigger finally hits on the DS for those folks in Europe, Gauntlet

1503
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,980
on the DS, Lost in Blue 3 on the DS, New Play Control Peekman comes out on the Wii, Raven

1504
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:53,280
Squad hits the Xbox 360 and PC, Rise of the Argonauts hits PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, Shell

1505
01:09:53,280 --> 01:10:00,960
Shock 2, fucking tongue twister, Shell Shock 2 Blood Trails comes out on 360, PS3 and PC,

1506
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,360
and Walk With Me, do you know your walking routine on the DS?

1507
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,680
Do you know that you're walking right now?

1508
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:11,920
Isn't it funny that even when we get the crap game, so do Europe, but when we get a great

1509
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,520
game like Chrono Trigger, they have to wait like three months for it.

1510
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,520
You poor guys.

1511
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,520
Well, they got Pikmin.

1512
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:22,320
See, they're gonna get the port of Pikmin now, and we're gonna get the new Zelda months

1513
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,600
before they will.

1514
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,600
Yeah.

1515
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,600
That's fair.

1516
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,600
Go Nintendo.

1517
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,600
I'm sorry.

1518
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,840
Boy oh boy.

1519
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:35,320
You know what else is equally awesome as, you know, delays and stuff like that?

1520
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:43,280
Rock band receiving some brand new tracks from Nickelodeon's High School Musical-esque

1521
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:51,200
movie, Spectacular, yes, there's two songs from the film, Break My Heart and Don't Tell

1522
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,200
Me.

1523
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:58,160
They're both available for the equivalent of one dollar on your Xbox Live Marketplace

1524
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,640
or PlayStation Network.

1525
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:09,720
And of course, if you happen to wait until March 31st for the DVD release of Spectacular,

1526
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:14,040
there will also be a redemption code for a free download of the two songs via the rock

1527
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,220
band music store.

1528
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:33,920
And if you're curious what this sounds like, it's not terrible.

1529
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:34,920
Yes, it is.

1530
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,720
I don't think I'd pay money for it though.

1531
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,480
It's not terrible, but it is terrible.

1532
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,480
Shut up.

1533
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,160
It's interesting how diverse rock band is getting, I mean, we have the country stuff

1534
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,360
and now we get the tween stuff.

1535
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,880
The thing is, it's not anything that you have to download, but I do appreciate the option

1536
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,680
of being able to download something like this, because that means that they can release other

1537
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,960
things that are of other genres that, you know, may appeal to me a little bit more.

1538
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,400
I mean, at least they're willing to put it up there, then to just say, oh, we're just

1539
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,900
going to put out more, you know.

1540
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:14,800
The entire chat room is crying out in pain at what we just played, especially because

1541
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,520
you won't hear this on the podcast because the podcasts are mono sound, but when it played

1542
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,080
live, that YouTube, for whatever reason, was left channel only.

1543
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,460
So people are like, ah, my right ear is bleeding.

1544
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:33,120
By the way, you have your headset on backwards because that YouTube was left channel only.

1545
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,960
Dark Tetsuya pours bleach on his speakers, Leo Shen, my ears are bleeding now, damn it.

1546
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,760
Alright fine, I guess there's not a lot of people that are going to be downloading the

1547
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,160
Spectacular songs.

1548
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,960
But it's spectacular.

1549
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,120
But it's spectacular.

1550
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,520
Also Spectacular is a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1551
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,040
We like to pay a little respect to the classic games, and it's a little segment we do here

1552
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,720
on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.

1553
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:04,760
Of course, Dark Soccer is the one that usually does this segment, but she's not here tonight,

1554
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,200
so we have no game that she picked.

1555
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,080
I decided to pick one for us, but you know, I kind of picked one collectively for all

1556
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,200
of us to kind of match, you know, there is a certain something going on right now in

1557
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,200
the world, you know, there's that big game, I guess they throw a ball around and all this

1558
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,200
stuff.

1559
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,320
No, no, of course, we are taping the same day as the Super Bowl, and when you talk football

1560
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,480
and you talk video games, there really is one classic video game you have to recognize,

1561
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,440
and that is this week's Classic Game of the Week.

1562
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:33,760
Blades of Steel.

1563
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,760
No.

1564
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,360
Tecmo Bowl is this week's Classic Game of the Week.

1565
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,760
Yay.

1566
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:47,440
That's right, the wonderful 8-bit sounds of Tecmo Bowl on the NES.

1567
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,520
I chose purposefully not to do Tecmo Super Bowl tonight, I did Tecmo Bowl, the old school

1568
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,440
game, because this is, you know, a little more of a classic, and this is, I played this

1569
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:01,240
game a hell of a lot growing up, you know, and I know we like to think that Rob plays

1570
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:05,360
like no sports games and hates them all, but there are a few, few and far between that

1571
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,520
will come along once in a while to get my attention, and Tecmo Bowl was one of them.

1572
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,280
So let's learn a little bit about Tecmo Bowl.

1573
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,280
Tecmo Bowl was actually based off an arcade game, an arcade version of Tecmo Bowl.

1574
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,200
I should be noted, that's not what we're citing as the Classic Game of the Week, because I've

1575
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:23,000
played the arcade version in a compilation that was on the Xbox, Tecmo Classic Arcade,

1576
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,280
and it stinks compared to the one on the NES.

1577
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,560
It doesn't seem to move as quickly, I just don't care for it.

1578
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,880
So Tecmo Bowl on the NES is our Classic Game of the Week.

1579
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,720
You've probably seen this before, it was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 12, 2007,

1580
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:44,440
but the original came out in 1989 after the original arcade version was released in 1987.

1581
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,640
The arcade version had this big two monitor setup so that four people could play, but

1582
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,600
the NES version was way scaled down because it was only two players.

1583
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,640
You could do three modes, one player, two player, or just a coach mode where you would

1584
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,760
pick all the plays.

1585
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,040
The playbook only has four offensive plays, or if you're on defense, you kind of try to

1586
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,000
pick the play that you think the offense is going to pick, and you did it with this combination

1587
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,480
of the controller and the buttons.

1588
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,800
Tecmo Bowl isn't a perfect game though, it was a little better than Ten Yard Fight, which

1589
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,600
was one of the only other football games that was out at the time.

1590
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,800
Apparently almost any pass that you throw to a covered receiver is going to end up an

1591
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,320
interception.

1592
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,620
If you use the New York Giants, and you use Lawrence Taylor, apparently you can pretty

1593
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:31,680
much block almost all kicks, and apparently San Francisco has a play that is usually unstoppable

1594
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,720
against almost any defense, and I used to win every time with San Francisco and I think

1595
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,000
that's probably why.

1596
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,560
By the way, you wouldn't actually be playing as the New York Giants though in the game

1597
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,280
because they didn't have the licensing from the NFL to actually use the names of the teams,

1598
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:51,200
so when you selected teams, you were just Indianapolis, or San Francisco, or New York.

1599
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,920
But it was weird, they had certain teams in the game but not certain others.

1600
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,640
For instance, you don't have, you know, the Steelers.

1601
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,640
I don't know if that has to do with the whole NFL layup, I don't know, forget it.

1602
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,120
But anyway, I don't know enough about football to understand the whole thing behind that,

1603
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:15,360
but you do get the players, and they are all in the game, and you know, it was the old

1604
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,960
8-bit NES days, they didn't really look any different, it's just that you had the different

1605
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:19,960
names.

1606
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,120
However, if you downloaded this on the Virtual Console version, you didn't get the names

1607
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,800
because the licensing had expired, so they actually removed all the names from the version

1608
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,520
that came out for Virtual Console, which kind of stinks, if you think about it.

1609
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,160
By the way, there was also a version on mobile phones that was released in 2004, and apparently

1610
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,600
they are bringing this series back.

1611
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:41,920
Tecmo Bowl Kickoff, I don't know if this came out yet, but that was supposed to be coming

1612
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,440
out on the DS, but I don't know if that ever did actually come out, or is still on its

1613
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:52,720
way out, but I think it, I can't remember if it came out in November or not, it was

1614
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,000
originally going to come out in November.

1615
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,880
You know what, it just, it just isn't the old school 8-bit version, so, you know, and

1616
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,080
I know there's a lot of people very partial to Tecmo Super Bowl, but I just, I have to

1617
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:09,720
take a minute to just recognize the greatness of the classic NES version, you're actually

1618
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,720
nodding your head, Rice Princess.

1619
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,720
Uh, yes, it did come out.

1620
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,720
Oh, it did come out?

1621
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,720
When did it come out?

1622
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,320
Uh, not too long ago, but it's available for 20 bucks.

1623
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,320
There you go.

1624
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,320
Apparently it just price dropped.

1625
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,200
Rice Princess, were you a fan of Tecmo Bowl?

1626
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,200
No.

1627
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,200
No?

1628
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:23,200
Okay.

1629
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,200
Were there any sports games that you played?

1630
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:31,680
Um, I liked this about Tecmo Bowl too, was that it had like little cinematics, when you

1631
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,200
had to touch down, it was like high five and super slow motion because we don't really

1632
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:41,080
have movies, and this halftime show, whoa, I know, cinematic halftime show is pretty

1633
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,080
awesome.

1634
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:47,760
It's like Ninja Gaiden, but with the ball, I was nodding my head because I'm concurring

1635
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:54,880
with your point about like, um, paying homage to like the older original versions and stuff

1636
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,880
like that.

1637
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,480
Personally, if I were to pick a, you know, an NFL game that was going to be my, um, you

1638
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:05,120
know, pick for something like this today, NFL Blitz, I knew it.

1639
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,480
All right, fair enough.

1640
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,240
Maybe next year, maybe during next Super Bowl, we'll see.

1641
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,240
But that's it for now.

1642
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,960
It's your classic game of the week, Tecmo Bowl here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1643
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,920
And with that, it's going to bring part A of our show to a close tonight, but don't

1644
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,000
go anywhere because we're going to be just right back in a few seconds with part B. If

1645
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,960
you're listening on the podcast, it only takes a few seconds.

1646
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,960
You hear that little doo, doo, doo, doo, and then it's right back into part B. But if you're

1647
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,440
listening live, this is the point where we, uh, take a little bit longer of a break to,

1648
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:37,920
you know, get a drink of water, use the restroom, toilet bowl, not the toilet Super Bowl.

1649
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,160
And this will actually be, it's very special this week, our break, because this will be

1650
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:46,440
try to restrain a rice princess from my Xbox 360 for 10 minutes during the break.

1651
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,480
So we'll see how that works.

1652
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:59,040
We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1653
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,920
Hi and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the

1654
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:03,920
1st of 2009.

1655
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,160
You know, there's a big football game going on today, but we're here doing a show anyway.

1656
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:09,160
It's over actually.

1657
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,160
The Steelers won.

1658
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,160
Apparently it was really exciting.

1659
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:16,680
I guess there was like a, a big run to a touchdown or things like, you can totally tell.

1660
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:21,240
I don't know dick about football when you play football, although I do love tech mobile

1661
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,560
as you saw there at the end of part a, but we're back now with more of Orange Lounge

1662
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,360
Radio and we have a plenty more news stories to get to dark soccer is not here tonight

1663
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,360
if you're just tuning in.

1664
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,000
Cause we've had people slowly tuning as, as people realize it's over on the game.

1665
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,440
Uh, we have more and more people slowly tuning in tonight.

1666
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,440
Dark soccer is not here tonight.

1667
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:42,240
She has some family errands to take care of and lovely Prosser Washington, which I think

1668
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,960
is towards the South of Washington.

1669
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,960
I'm not sure.

1670
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,960
I don't live there.

1671
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,800
Um, but she's, she's not that close to Seattle.

1672
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,800
That's what she told me.

1673
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,160
It's not that close to Seattle.

1674
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,800
Um, but we're still here.

1675
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,160
Rice princess is here tonight, uh, helping to fill in and give us some sarcasm and wit

1676
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,480
as she usually does, or at least attempts to do.

1677
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,520
And silent Nathan is also here, but he wouldn't know cause he doesn't say much, but he is

1678
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,840
here wearing his hoard hat, uh, showing his pride for the hoard.

1679
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,840
I'm wearing my Alliance sweater.

1680
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,920
Oh, do you two like fight for real over?

1681
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,920
Awesome.

1682
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,100
Oh, too bad we don't have a webcam, but we will have it next week.

1683
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,720
Cause there's a cord coming from New Jersey.

1684
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,720
I found out.

1685
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,720
Woo.

1686
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:20,720
Woo hoo.

1687
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,840
All right, let's get back into some gaming news.

1688
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,960
Loki's here to deliver the news as always.

1689
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,960
What's up, Loki?

1690
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,960
Uh, not much.

1691
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,320
Um, there will be some new download content coming out for the new Prince of Persia game.

1692
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,480
Um, this takes place after the end of the game.

1693
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:40,200
It's going to be the epilogue download content and it will kind of further develop the relationship

1694
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:45,400
between the two main characters and also have them, um, you know, going after our new enemy,

1695
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
the shape shifter.

1696
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,320
Are they going to do it yet?

1697
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,560
I don't think so.

1698
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,640
And then it's apparently the shape shifter is an enemy that takes the form of two of

1699
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,120
Eremon's most fearsome lieutenants, the warrior and the hunter.

1700
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:02,760
And it's as though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player.

1701
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,720
It will require a particular strategy to defeat the shape shifter, rewarding the player that

1702
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,600
takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the epilogue.

1703
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,480
Will I get to have more conversations with the chick that always saves me from falling

1704
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,480
to my death?

1705
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,480
Uh, possibly.

1706
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,480
Awesome.

1707
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,360
And, uh, of course, you know, they're going to have the sprinting offensive and Elika

1708
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:27,480
is going to get the new energized power, which will allow her to temporarily, um, temporarily

1709
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,560
restore a piece of destroyed environment.

1710
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,560
Huh.

1711
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,720
That'd be interesting.

1712
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:37,480
Will, uh, will the game still help me every step of the way by telling me what buttons

1713
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:38,480
to push?

1714
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,480
Maybe.

1715
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,480
Awesome.

1716
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,600
Uh, the download content will be available though on February 26th.

1717
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,160
All right.

1718
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,160
Check that out.

1719
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,160
How much do they have price for that?

1720
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,160
No price yet.

1721
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,560
So, uh, somewhere between five and $10.

1722
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,560
I'm guessing.

1723
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:57,220
Well, something that does have a price, a pretty high price, 8,190 yen, they are going

1724
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,220
to charge to this.

1725
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,020
That's 90 American dollars.

1726
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:05,680
They are charging for the last remnant on PC, and this is according to Famitsu Magazine.

1727
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,600
There is a PC port of the last remnant.

1728
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,520
This was a role playing game that was put on the Xbox 360.

1729
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,200
They hit kind of mixed reviews.

1730
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,360
Um, some of our listeners have been saying pretty favorable things about this.

1731
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,040
I haven't checked this game out myself yet.

1732
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,160
Um, but if you don't own an Xbox 360 and you want to check this out on PC, um, you might

1733
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:25,120
be in luck because it is coming in Japan on April 9th, but it is going to have that pretty

1734
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,120
high price tag.

1735
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,960
And then when you count importing fees on top of that or what have you, although of

1736
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,960
course, I'm sure if you wanted to go to darker places on the internet, you could probably

1737
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,960
get it for free.

1738
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,960
Um, but I don't know, you know, it's going to be all in Japanese, so who knows?

1739
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,160
Um, apparently though, it's going to actually give you some extra stuff in the PC version.

1740
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:44,720
You can speed up battle animations now.

1741
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:47,880
Um, it will have more leader class characters.

1742
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,960
You can preview equipment in the menu and you can actually switch between Japanese and

1743
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,960
English.

1744
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,080
So maybe you won't need to patch much more than the menus to get this.

1745
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,360
So, and Rama is in chat and says it's a great game.

1746
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,840
He says, last remnant, great game at comment coming from our chat room, chat dot orange

1747
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,840
launch radio.com.

1748
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:05,440
If you're just joining us post super bowl, you should come join us as long as it's easier

1749
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,120
to install and have run than grand theft auto four.

1750
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,360
By the way, one other quick thing I want to say about this game.

1751
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,160
This is the game that a square enix took the unreal engine for.

1752
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,200
Remember you might remember a few years back, there was a big news story that square enix

1753
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,200
had purchased the unreal engine for something.

1754
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,280
This is that game.

1755
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:27,160
So you can see it in motion on the PC in the last remnant.

1756
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:32,400
Apparently it was un-really disappointing.

1757
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,240
That's a mixed mixed bag, mixed bag of opinions.

1758
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,240
Yeah.

1759
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,720
Well, something that might be a little bit better, hopefully are some sequels to some

1760
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,980
well known capcom franchises.

1761
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:50,240
There was some talk about brand new dead rising game and a lost planet game and that they

1762
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:54,300
may possibly be multi platform.

1763
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:59,200
This of course is coming from an issue of Famitsu magazine with an interview with the

1764
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:06,520
capcom executive Kenji Inafune and of course he mentioned of course new dead rising lost

1765
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:07,520
planet games.

1766
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,840
I mean, not a big surprise since you know capcom dead rising did very well for them

1767
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:17,660
and you know they're making a lost planet movie for god's sake so not a big surprise

1768
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:22,240
that we'll see some new games and the fact that they'll be multi platform is not a shock

1769
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,240
either.

1770
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:26,440
Cool, hopefully those are soon.

1771
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,940
Hopefully we'll see those at E3.

1772
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,440
It's interesting to think about what kinds of stuff we're really going to see come out

1773
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,640
of E3 this year because there's been a lot of, it's been fairly quiet all things considered.

1774
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:39,160
I'm thinking this year's E3 is going to be pretty big especially with the whole return

1775
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:44,520
to E3's roots even though they say not really but you know that whole thing.

1776
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,520
We'll see.

1777
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,500
Also, but capcom is all about the multi porting too so I'm sure if these things are coming

1778
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,360
out they're going to be everywhere on every platform right?

1779
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,720
There you go.

1780
01:24:55,720 --> 01:25:00,100
Alright let's see, let's talk about Bioshock 2 another game that's probably going to get

1781
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,560
some attention at E3.

1782
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,800
I'm almost positive they've got to be showing more of this game at E3 this year.

1783
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,440
Bioshock 2 the Sea of Dreams, or I'm sorry Sea of Dreams there's no V in there.

1784
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:14,040
But Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams is actually going to finally add something that was missing

1785
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,400
from the first Bioshock and what was missing from the first Bioshock for being a first

1786
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,400
person shooter?

1787
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,400
Multiplayer.

1788
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,600
That's right.

1789
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:24,040
Apparently this is all according to some recent job listings that were discovered.

1790
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,080
The Bioshock team is looking for some multiplayer gameplay experts.

1791
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,520
They're looking for some people who know how to extend and enhance the Unreal Engine 3

1792
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:37,560
with proprietary networking technology to address gameplay performance and so on.

1793
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:43,240
As somebody who can deliver a robust, scalable and responsive multiplayer gameplay code and

1794
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:47,300
backend services for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms.

1795
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:51,480
So unless there's some top secret unannounced project going on here, you can almost count

1796
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,340
on the fact that Bioshock 2 is going to have multiplayer in it.

1797
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,600
Which is something the first one was pretty lacking.

1798
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,800
Although honestly, I mean it didn't need it.

1799
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,380
Bioshock was a hell of a first person shooter game.

1800
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:07,080
You know that even people that don't play a lot of first person shooters like me can

1801
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,080
get into.

1802
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:12,760
Because it was almost like Silent Hill-ish in how scary it was, at least for me.

1803
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,700
Kind of the psychological element of the game.

1804
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:19,360
So it's going to be interesting to see what multiplayer does to all that.

1805
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:23,760
Then that gets me thinking, since I invoked Silent Hill in that last story, why did we

1806
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,400
never get like a multiplayer Silent Hill?

1807
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,240
Wouldn't that be kind of interesting?

1808
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,240
Well because they tried, I don't think it would work out.

1809
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:34,440
I guess it wouldn't because Silent Hill, you know a lot of times is somebody's personal

1810
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,440
interpretation.

1811
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,440
You know what I mean?

1812
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,560
It's usually a very personalized story so I don't think anything like that would really

1813
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,560
work.

1814
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:41,560
But it's fun to think about.

1815
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Not really.

1816
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,560
Shut up.

1817
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:51,720
Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be getting some brand new download packs in February.

1818
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:58,040
The first pack is going to be the Acoustic Track Pack, which is available for 440 Microsoft

1819
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,040
Points.

1820
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,280
Included with that will be the song Holic.

1821
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,280
That makes me angry.

1822
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,280
Oops.

1823
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,280
No.

1824
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:13,200
And the Acoustic Track Pack, which will be available for 440 Microsoft Points or $5.49,

1825
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:20,000
will include three different songs, including Drive by Incubus, a new slang by The Shins,

1826
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,240
and Wonderwall, the Oasis cover by Ryan Adams.

1827
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,240
Those are each also available for 160 Microsoft Points or $2 each.

1828
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,640
Wait a minute.

1829
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:33,920
Ryan Adams covered Wonderwall?

1830
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,460
Like, wow.

1831
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,920
That's going to be bad.

1832
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,920
I'm sorry.

1833
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,580
I saw Ryan Adams once in concert and he was kind of a douche.

1834
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:49,020
So I mean, he's a douchey guy covering a douchey song from a douchey band.

1835
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:52,360
I mean, this is just like, oh, this is going to be terrible.

1836
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,360
Sorry.

1837
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:58,360
Then we have the Wings Track Pack, which is also available for 440 Microsoft Points or

1838
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:08,300
$5.49, including Junior's Farm, Hi Hi Hi, and Jet, and I'm sure nothing that has to

1839
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:13,080
do with the television series Wings.

1840
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:20,360
Then we have the Bob Seger Track Pack, also 440 Microsoft Points and $5.49, including

1841
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:26,840
that old-time rock and roll, that's awesome, Her Strut, and Get Out of Denver, which is

1842
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,100
a live version.

1843
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:33,080
An old buddy of Orange Lounge Radio, Marissa, is in chat right now.

1844
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,160
I love me some Marissa.

1845
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:35,800
I hope she comes back to the show at some point.

1846
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,760
She's in chat right now, so Marissa Congusto, and she's saying, yes, he did in regards to

1847
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,760
Ryan Adams.

1848
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,480
He changed the melody, and then OMG, no, I heart Oasis.

1849
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,480
Don't get me wrong.

1850
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,480
I like Oasis.

1851
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:50,480
I actually downloaded some of their stuff for Rock Band, but if you ever have listened

1852
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,920
to them in interviews, they are kind of douchey.

1853
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:54,920
They're straight up assholes.

1854
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:55,920
What are you talking about?

1855
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,600
But you know, hey, some of the greatest musicians were big douchebags, so, you know.

1856
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,600
And some weren't.

1857
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,600
All right.

1858
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:02,600
Wait.

1859
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,600
Sorry, Loki.

1860
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,600
Oh, that's it.

1861
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:11,120
Oh, OK, well, then we'll talk about PC games, and interesting that they say, at least according

1862
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,520
to a survey that's coming out from, I believe, is this coming from the MPD group?

1863
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,520
Yes, it is.

1864
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:23,640
MPD group is saying 47% of PC game purchases are, in fact, digital.

1865
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:27,800
So meaning, you know, Steam, D2D, or whatever's going on there.

1866
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,000
So this is funny, because last week, weren't we just talking about how it seemed like the

1867
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,280
shelf space at GameStop for PC games was little to none?

1868
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,280
Yes.

1869
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,040
So, kind of interesting here.

1870
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:43,640
Apparently, according to the survey, 93% of PC gamers bought at least one game digitally

1871
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,840
in the past 12 months.

1872
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,760
71% bought four games digitally.

1873
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,760
Very interesting.

1874
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:54,360
But then I think about some of those games, like PopCap, and those types of games, like,

1875
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,320
you know, if you go and download, you know, because I bring this up, because obviously

1876
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:01,560
they're huge, casual PC games, you know, and a lot of people go to the site, download the

1877
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,520
trial game, and then you can, you know, put your credit card number in online and get

1878
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,760
the full version.

1879
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,480
That's digital distribution right there.

1880
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,560
You know, I don't think that necessarily means, like, half of all games are bought off Steam.

1881
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:12,560
I don't think that's necessarily what it means.

1882
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,280
I think it goes a little deeper than that, especially when you filter in these classic

1883
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,760
games from a site like Yahoo Games or whatever, where, you know, you can get, you know, click

1884
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,320
now and put in your credit card number to get the full version of Diner Dash 5.

1885
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,320
Woo!

1886
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,320
And it will be.

1887
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,320
So.

1888
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,320
Yeah.

1889
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,600
That's kind of not surprising in a way, but interesting.

1890
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,600
Yes.

1891
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,600
Very.

1892
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,600
You know what else is interesting?

1893
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,200
I'm sure that means the shelf space is going to continue to shrink.

1894
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,120
What else is interesting, Logie?

1895
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:47,360
People finding different things about LittleBigPlanet, including some upcoming patch details.

1896
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:54,960
Apparently, this was leaked out from a photo that was on Media Modicles Flickr page.

1897
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:00,160
And if you look very closely, you'll notice that there is a white board with a bunch of

1898
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,120
different information about download content and updates.

1899
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:10,120
And the next one that's on the list there, which I can't quite see the code name for,

1900
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:17,520
but it will include new tutorials and online creation mode, where you'll be able to work

1901
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,680
with other players and create your own levels online.

1902
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:21,680
Awesome.

1903
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:26,160
And apparently, there's also going to be a new arcade pack at some point.

1904
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,480
I don't know what exactly that is.

1905
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,480
Arcade pack?

1906
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,480
Yeah.

1907
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,480
It says...

1908
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:32,480
That could be all kinds of cool!

1909
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,040
...what will include no idea.

1910
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,680
But something else.

1911
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,680
Yeah.

1912
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:39,560
I'm trying to see code name.

1913
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,640
What are your thoughts on LittleBigPlanet, RicePrincess?

1914
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,800
You haven't talked a lot about it on the show, but I know you love Wii.

1915
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,220
You hate 360.

1916
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:48,420
So PS3's got to be a nice neutral ground.

1917
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,420
What do you think about LittleBigPlanet?

1918
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,420
I don't know.

1919
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:51,920
I've never played it.

1920
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:52,920
Really?

1921
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,920
Really.

1922
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,920
I haven't.

1923
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:55,920
It's actually a lot of fun.

1924
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,920
It was my favorite game that came out last year.

1925
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:57,920
Really?

1926
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,920
Yeah, I love it.

1927
01:31:58,920 --> 01:31:59,920
I don't have a PS3.

1928
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,160
You've got to see how cheesy some of the user levels are.

1929
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:04,160
I think that's how you will like it.

1930
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:09,080
Go on there and play the Warcraft-inspired Onyxia's Lair level.

1931
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,080
Oh, God.

1932
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,960
You'll love it for how cheesy it can be.

1933
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:12,960
I hope so.

1934
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,960
I wonder if there's a Rocky Horror Picture Show level.

1935
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:15,960
There should be.

1936
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:16,960
There ought to be.

1937
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:17,960
I'm going to search for one.

1938
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:18,960
Oh, my word.

1939
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,960
If not, we need to make one somehow.

1940
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,960
Totally.

1941
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,960
Where your character has to jump to the left and then step to the right.

1942
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,960
Oh, my God.

1943
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:24,960
Consistently.

1944
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,960
And utilize the pelvic thrust.

1945
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:26,960
Yes.

1946
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:27,960
And utilize the pelvic thrust.

1947
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:28,960
To drive people insane.

1948
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:29,960
All right.

1949
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:30,960
Shut up.

1950
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:31,960
All right.

1951
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,480
But all these features sound pretty awesome for LittleBigPlanet.

1952
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,480
Yes.

1953
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,960
So, no word to the time frame?

1954
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:38,960
No.

1955
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:46,080
But, again, this is based off information that's coming off of a picture of a whiteboard.

1956
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:54,720
Well, still, you know, if the studio themselves put up the picture, I would actually say that

1957
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:58,960
is a pretty respectable source because I don't think they're going to think to, quick, erase

1958
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,960
the whiteboard.

1959
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,960
We're spilling all our secrets.

1960
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,960
You know what I mean?

1961
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,800
They're spilling your secrets onto the whiteboard.

1962
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,040
Sorry.

1963
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,040
I'm laughing at chat.

1964
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,040
AcidicVampire in chat.

1965
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,040
Chat.onoursonstrated.com.

1966
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,440
You're getting read a lot tonight, buddy.

1967
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,800
He's saying a lot of funny things.

1968
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,520
It says, Skye, play the Parker Posey level.

1969
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,520
It's not popular, but it's great.

1970
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,520
What?

1971
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,880
There's a Parker Posey level.

1972
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,880
Oh, my God.

1973
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,560
I want to play it so bad.

1974
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:25,200
I think I'm going to do that right after the show.

1975
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,880
No, because I'm going to play Resident Evil 5.

1976
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,520
I'm going to push you if you don't let me.

1977
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,960
I have to put that in the queue.

1978
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:33,920
Do I get to unlock stickers of Parker Posey?

1979
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:34,920
I don't know.

1980
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:35,920
If so, I'm so sold.

1981
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,920
That's awesome.

1982
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:37,920
Like, party girl and everything.

1983
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,920
Oh, God.

1984
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,920
Amazing.

1985
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,800
Aw, or like, why is that?

1986
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,520
Silent Nathan is now suddenly interested in Little Big Planet?

1987
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,440
Maybe I'll go play it right now.

1988
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,440
Right now.

1989
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,440
Now.

1990
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,440
All right.

1991
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,440
Bye.

1992
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:58,440
Um, hey, speaking of games that I want to play right now, I can't play this right now,

1993
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,840
but apparently it's going to be in development.

1994
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,160
Tron, a new game.

1995
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,160
A new Tron game.

1996
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,520
You know, they showed that trailer for Tron 2, or TR2N.

1997
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,720
What they showed at Comic Con.

1998
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:14,920
Apparently there is a game coming out for this whole thing as well.

1999
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:15,920
This is according to Variety.

2000
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,320
Even though there were some issues with the Disney video game company, Variety magazine

2001
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,520
is reporting that apparently Disney is shipping to game developers a concept for TR2N, or

2002
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,520
Tron 2.

2003
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,680
Of course, no idea what it's going to be like or anything.

2004
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:35,520
But of course this makes me think, okay, there was a Tron 2.0, and it wasn't very well received.

2005
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:40,280
So hopefully whatever, but the original Tron game was awesome.

2006
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,280
Never played it.

2007
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:42,280
It's pretty awesome.

2008
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,800
They have it on Xbox Live, and it was one of those games that was better in the 80s,

2009
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,040
and when you play it now you're kind of like, oh, this game is better left in my imagination.

2010
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,540
But it still was pretty cool, especially for an 80s game.

2011
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:57,920
What do you think about, like, reinventing franchises?

2012
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,920
Such as Tron?

2013
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,440
Sure.

2014
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,120
I'm okay with it, I guess.

2015
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,400
I don't know.

2016
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,320
I think especially a series like Tron needed a sequel a long time ago.

2017
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,320
It seems a little late.

2018
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:13,480
But then when you look at a series like The Goonies, or there is no series there, right?

2019
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,040
They don't need to make A Goonies 2.

2020
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,360
Like if they made A Goonies 2, you know it's going to be stupid.

2021
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,360
Or The Karate Kid?

2022
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,360
No.

2023
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,360
Just no.

2024
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,680
Are you talking about the movie or the game?

2025
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,360
Oh, the movie.

2026
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,800
The game was amazing.

2027
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,520
That's another classic game that we need to have sometimes, is Goonies 2.

2028
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,520
That game was amazing.

2029
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,520
Heck yes.

2030
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:30,520
Oh my god.

2031
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,020
I thought you did that as a classic game already.

2032
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,000
I don't know if Dark Soccer has ever done it.

2033
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I'd have to check the wiki.

2034
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,600
But I don't think it's ever been a classic game.

2035
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,880
I'd have to check the wiki on your own show.

2036
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:40,880
Yes.

2037
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:41,880
Well look, I don't know.

2038
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:44,880
Look, we've done the classic game of the week for like at least a year now.

2039
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:47,280
So I don't know every single game we've highlighted.

2040
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,280
There's a lot.

2041
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:51,960
But thankfully we have a wiki and the fans update the wiki because they're awesome.

2042
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,200
Did someone let Nathan run in the house really to go play Playstation 3?

2043
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,200
Probably that jerkwad.

2044
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,720
Hey Nathan, you're cool.

2045
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,080
And not a jerkwad at all.

2046
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,080
Anyhow.

2047
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:08,760
It's a neutron game in development, probably to come out with a movie if they can find

2048
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:14,400
somebody to do, you know, take the financial hit for all the development, I guess, in this

2049
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,400
economy.

2050
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,000
Disney does have their own studio.

2051
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,200
Yeah, but it's been hurting.

2052
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:23,320
Well yeah, because they put out Turok and I mean, come on.

2053
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:27,120
I could have told you that Turok's gonna suck before they even put Turok out.

2054
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,000
And they're like, seriously, really, you're gonna put Turok out?

2055
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Really?

2056
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,840
This is something you think is a great idea?

2057
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:35,880
The economy is going downhill, what game should we make?

2058
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:36,880
Turok!

2059
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,280
It's a great idea!

2060
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:42,680
Amaze Satsuma in chat wonders if Sky wants a Showgirls 2.

2061
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:47,040
You know there was supposed to be a Showgirls 2, where, cause at the end of Showgirls 1

2062
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:51,320
it alludes to the fact that Nomi Malone is going to Hollywood, and Showgirls 2 was supposed

2063
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,080
to be a parody on Hollywood, like the first one was a parody on Vegas, but then the movie

2064
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:59,600
came out and they decided to can the sequel.

2065
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,600
Never mind.

2066
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:04,440
I would be in full support of a Showgirls 2, but not now, I mean Elizabeth Berkley's

2067
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,280
not gonna do it, what's the point?

2068
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:12,800
The point is, that we have all these wonderful porn studios that can develop a movie now,

2069
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:17,800
I mean they're doing more theatrical movies, and hell, they have all the knockoffs, like

2070
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:25,560
all the TV show ones, like Not the Bradys, Not the Munsters, Not Bewitched, I don't know

2071
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:33,640
what the other ones are, but, I mean, not My Three Sons, I'm not sure about that one.

2072
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,320
How come porn studios don't get into gaming?

2073
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,640
You know you see all these legitimate movie studios getting into gaming.

2074
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:44,840
There's porn actresses that are in the gaming, but you know, not, I don't know.

2075
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:47,640
There's a lot of people that love World of Warcraft.

2076
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:48,640
There are.

2077
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,080
I don't know why, but there are.

2078
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,240
I knew a stripper who played World of Warcraft, and all the nerds would like message her on

2079
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:57,360
the message board, like, oh my god, did you do this?

2080
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:01,240
There's a stripper that's over at our local strip club that plays World of Warcraft.

2081
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:04,840
There's probably a stripper at every strip club that plays World of Warcraft, because

2082
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:09,840
everybody plays World of Warcraft, I'm just saying, though, I don't know.

2083
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,840
Plus think about it, if you're a stripper, you know, you're working nights, you're probably

2084
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,680
home during the day with a kid, I'm kind of reminded, I don't know if you've ever seen

2085
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:24,180
the Guild, but I'm kind of reminded of Carla from the Guild, who by the way is by far

2086
01:38:24,180 --> 01:38:26,880
my favorite character on that program.

2087
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:33,480
But the stripper that's local that plays WoW, she's a nerd, like she's an Asian girl, and

2088
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,120
her stage name's Kitana.

2089
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,280
Yeah, that's the one.

2090
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,280
Yeah, that's totally the one.

2091
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,280
Freaking dork.

2092
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:44,600
Wait a minute, do we just have a six degrees of stripper here in the studio?

2093
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,720
Like we just found out that Loki and Rice Princess know the same stripper?

2094
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,240
Do you know that stripper?

2095
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,160
I don't know her, but I've seen her movies.

2096
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:53,680
I don't like her at a large movie or anything.

2097
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:58,240
Well, I know her that well, but I know her in the biblical sense.

2098
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:04,880
No, you know, when we're really bored sometimes, you know, the wife and I decided to go to

2099
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,920
the strip club.

2100
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,120
She wants to go again, actually, she keeps saying that.

2101
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,760
I want to go, I keep saying I want to go.

2102
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,600
We need to have an OLR at this strip club night.

2103
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,680
No, but seriously, I mean, when you're getting, you know, a lot of times when you're getting

2104
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:21,600
like a lap dance and stuff, it's seriously the weirdest conversations, I mean, it's like

2105
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,000
about games and shit.

2106
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,560
You know, you mentioned that you do a game podcast and it's like, oh my God, I play games

2107
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,560
too.

2108
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,560
That's so funny.

2109
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:30,560
Like, how does that even come up in conversation?

2110
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,120
Is she like, so what do you do?

2111
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:37,080
And you're like, well, actually, here's the thing is because, you know, to get into how

2112
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:42,760
strip clubs operate, they have to wait until the new song begins because you have, when

2113
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:47,640
you're paying for a lap dance is for X number of songs and you're not just going to start,

2114
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:48,960
you know, if it's in the middle of a song.

2115
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:52,760
So you have to sit there and wait for the new song and during that time it's you.

2116
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,760
So what do you do?

2117
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,760
You know, how's it going?

2118
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,560
You know, that kind of stuff.

2119
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,520
And that's where the games come up because that's all I do is games.

2120
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:04,080
No, the time I got a lap dance, because I went to the strip club once and my friends

2121
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,480
like, you were there, Irene, right?

2122
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,480
Okay.

2123
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,920
My friends made me say which stripper I thought was the hottest.

2124
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,920
And naturally I said the one that looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, because there was

2125
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,300
a stripper there looked just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

2126
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:19,520
And she, you know, they, but they paid for a lap dance and it pretty much started right

2127
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:20,520
away.

2128
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,520
I guess the song was coming on or whatever.

2129
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,760
Like, you know, she was rubbing her boobies in my face and the whole thing and it was

2130
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,560
just very awkward for me, but whatever.

2131
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,840
So finally it was over and she said, Oh, you just, you should just relax, honey.

2132
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,480
She's like, you know, I hope you enjoyed it.

2133
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:36,340
You know, you could tell her self esteem was probably hurt a little bit because I was so

2134
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,920
nervous and I'm like, honey, it's nothing against you.

2135
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,160
I'm just gay.

2136
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,360
And she says, Oh, I could kind of tell.

2137
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,280
And then she's just sitting there and she's talking to me and she's like, Oh, my roommate's

2138
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,360
gay and I love him.

2139
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:47,360
He's the best thing.

2140
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,320
And so she's talking to me for like a whole nother song, but it was really awkward because

2141
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:53,880
she, like, she had no clothes on except some, you know, a thong.

2142
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:57,920
And it was, it was kind of strange, you know, I was just kind of like, just put a t-shirt

2143
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,400
on or something, you know, an acidic vampire says, Rob loves the boobies.

2144
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,400
Yes.

2145
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,560
Especially when he's drunk.

2146
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,800
Rob might be gay, but he loves all gay guys like boobies.

2147
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,800
It's, I don't know what it is.

2148
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,800
I guess everybody really likes boobies.

2149
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:12,800
Who doesn't like boobies?

2150
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,800
Women like boobies.

2151
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:14,800
Yeah.

2152
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,800
Women do.

2153
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:20,440
But yeah, you were going to say something, Nathan?

2154
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:25,960
I just want to point out though, some props in chat for the strip club with the wife,

2155
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,160
because some folks are like, Game Guru says, wait, wait, wait, you go to the strip club

2156
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,160
with your wife?

2157
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:32,960
She loves going.

2158
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,020
And somebody, it's not very often.

2159
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,280
It's just like, it was a while ago.

2160
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,000
Game Guru says your wife is the coolest.

2161
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:44,560
No, we seriously, we seriously thought we were going to do this, but we were so fucking

2162
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,300
tired from like the wedding day.

2163
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:52,800
We were seriously going to go in our wedding garb to the strip club.

2164
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,960
We were almost going to do it, but we were so exhausted.

2165
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:59,240
Like during the wedding, we were like, dude, yeah, we should totally go afterwards, just

2166
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:02,120
dressed up in the tux and everything.

2167
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,120
Because that would be hilarious.

2168
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:06,200
But we were just like so beat at the end of the day.

2169
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,200
It's like, fuck that.

2170
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:08,200
We're not going anywhere.

2171
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,200
Nice.

2172
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,200
Go sleep.

2173
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,200
Or not fuck that.

2174
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,200
Yeah, boobs are awesome.

2175
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:18,080
Let's see, Rama says Skye, you're a hypocrite.

2176
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,680
You have a problem with a woman in a bra and panties at a strip bar.

2177
01:42:21,680 --> 01:42:22,680
Hold up.

2178
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,680
She had no bra on.

2179
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,680
Okay.

2180
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:25,680
Yeah.

2181
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:26,680
Just panties.

2182
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,680
I wouldn't even call it like panties.

2183
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:32,800
When I, when you say panties, I think of like granny panties, you know, like regular panties,

2184
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,800
not a thong.

2185
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:35,520
She had like a thong on.

2186
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,920
But she'll have you go to a R.A.

2187
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:39,800
Rock, your picture show convention full of women in bra and panties.

2188
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:40,800
Well, that's different.

2189
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:42,280
That's why you're going there.

2190
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:43,280
That's theater.

2191
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,280
That's art.

2192
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,280
It's art.

2193
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,920
That's funny that you're laughing at that.

2194
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,920
That's art.

2195
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:55,440
But anyways, yes, there are a lot of people in all occupations that play World of Warcraft.

2196
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,440
Even strippers.

2197
01:42:56,440 --> 01:43:00,560
It's not like, you know, oh, I strip therefore I cannot play games at all.

2198
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,440
But yeah, porn stars, strippers.

2199
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,880
There's a lot.

2200
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:05,320
I mean, fuck.

2201
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,280
Just read like IGN.

2202
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,400
They do these stupid like babes of the day things and a lot of them that they put on

2203
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:14,160
there have fucking, you know, game, you know, interests and stuff like that.

2204
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:18,840
And you know, it's just all the more reason people think, oh my God, women, games, ooh,

2205
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,840
got to.

2206
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,840
Yeah.

2207
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:24,200
Marissa is in chat again saying they make all sorts of terrible porn games.

2208
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:27,140
Remember how I said earlier they need, why don't porn studios make games?

2209
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:30,520
They make all sorts of terrible porn games, but they're usually multiplayer online.

2210
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,320
I learned this by working in the porn capital of the world, Chatsworth, California.

2211
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,320
Okay.

2212
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:36,320
Two comments to that.

2213
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:40,520
A, I should have figured that out because, you know, on porn websites, so I've heard,

2214
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:43,840
you see a lot of times ads for those like multiplayer sex.

2215
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:44,840
So you've heard.

2216
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:45,840
Yeah.

2217
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:46,840
I just heard through Loki.

2218
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,840
Through your eyes.

2219
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,040
That that's what you see on those sites.

2220
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,040
And I guess you're right.

2221
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:53,200
I just don't think of them because they're not really out there and about.

2222
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:57,080
And B, I did not realize Chatsworth, California was the capital of porn industry, but it doesn't

2223
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,080
surprise me.

2224
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:03,320
But if you've ever been to Chatsworth, California, it's, it's, you know.

2225
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,100
Is it better than Buttonwillow?

2226
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:06,600
It's better than Buttonwillow.

2227
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:11,960
It's I would say Fresno is probably better than Chatsworth.

2228
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:14,640
And I like how we're only laughing because everybody else doesn't live in California.

2229
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,000
No offense to the people there.

2230
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Wow.

2231
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,320
Wink, wink, hint, hint.

2232
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:23,600
My grandma's from there.

2233
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,880
And her movie comes out next month.

2234
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:26,880
Ew.

2235
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,880
Ew.

2236
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:28,880
Ew.

2237
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:29,880
Gilf.

2238
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:30,880
Gross.

2239
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:35,240
And then Marissa also says, Rob can have some of my boob to play with, stress toys.

2240
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:36,800
I have too much anyway.

2241
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,800
Marissa does.

2242
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,800
Marissa has some nice big boobies.

2243
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:44,160
I would, I would definitely, you know, help relieve some stress.

2244
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:48,960
Your own stress all day with her boobs.

2245
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:49,960
All right.

2246
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,640
Can we move on back into video games?

2247
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:54,640
I don't know how we got on the whole topic of strippers from Tron.

2248
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,640
Who cares?

2249
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:56,640
Who cares?

2250
01:44:56,640 --> 01:45:01,880
Like, that was the last story we just did was Tron, I just want to point out.

2251
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:06,960
And then suddenly it's about strippers playing World of Warcraft and boobies in Chatsworth,

2252
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,040
California being the board capital of the world.

2253
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:15,320
I definitely would pay good money to see a stripper that's glowing in the Tron outfit.

2254
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:16,320
Absolutely.

2255
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:21,400
Hey, that, you know, there's that guy on the internet, the Tron guy who wears that outfit.

2256
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:22,840
No, no, no, not him.

2257
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,960
But you'll imagine if a woman wore that outfit.

2258
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,960
Is he hot?

2259
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:29,080
I don't want to see a woman the size of the Tron guy wearing that outfit.

2260
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,080
All right.

2261
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:34,480
I can't process this much data.

2262
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:38,160
Dark Knight in chat says, thank God Jamie's not here for this one.

2263
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:43,280
You know, it probably would have derailed even if she was here because it's not the

2264
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:44,600
fact that Jamie's not here.

2265
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,800
It's the fact that Rice Princess is here.

2266
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,840
Hey, I didn't bring up, wait, yes I did.

2267
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:51,840
Yes you did.

2268
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:52,840
La, la, la.

2269
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,840
Let's move on.

2270
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,800
Why do we have this whole six degrees of strippers thing going on here?

2271
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,960
Or we just both live in the same town and both go to the same strip club.

2272
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:04,600
Why am I not being invited to said strip club?

2273
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:07,440
I haven't gone in like a year or two.

2274
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,160
We need to fix this.

2275
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,600
It's been a long time.

2276
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:13,680
It's just because you go to the strip club and then afterwards you're like, that costs

2277
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,160
me a lot of money for very little time.

2278
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:17,440
Why the fuck did I do that?

2279
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:19,400
And then you forget about it after a while.

2280
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,480
You have guilty gear news, right Loki?

2281
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:27,120
Yes, speaking of guilt for spending all that money in strip clubs.

2282
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:33,840
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus has been announced by Axis to be coming to the US.

2283
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,600
They're planning on bringing it out on the PS2, the PSP, and the Wii.

2284
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:45,440
You may remember Axis also brought out Guilty Gear XX Accent Core a little bit earlier.

2285
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,840
I think it was last year actually.

2286
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:54,320
And this new game was planned on, I guess, coming out spring 2009, probably the latter

2287
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,360
half of the spring.

2288
01:46:56,360 --> 01:47:02,920
But it's not that different from Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, but Plus does feature some,

2289
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:07,840
I guess, more characters and some different stuff that they tweaked.

2290
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:12,640
Sorry, I was just showing Rice Princess a picture of Tron Guy.

2291
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:13,640
Thank you chatters.

2292
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,560
And then I almost vomited.

2293
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,680
Oh, so Guilty Gear, yeah.

2294
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:19,680
So it'll be coming out.

2295
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,520
Too bad it's something new, Guilty Gear.

2296
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:26,200
Or wait, that wasn't, it was something blue, I forget what they called it.

2297
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:29,160
The new game, it's not Guilty Gear, but it's done by the same people.

2298
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:34,440
It's all like HD, or not cel-shaded, but like hand drawn animation stuff.

2299
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,440
No idea.

2300
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
I don't know.

2301
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:41,560
Alright, well let's move on to the mailbag.

2302
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:44,580
It's the part of the show every week that you guys can send us an email and we'll read

2303
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:47,080
it here on the show and respond to whatever's in it.

2304
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,080
Or make fun of it.

2305
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:50,600
One of the two will happen.

2306
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:54,320
We invite your emails to be sent in to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2307
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,940
Although we didn't have a whole lot this week, that's probably because our podcast feed was

2308
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:58,940
behind a little bit.

2309
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:02,240
But by the way, it is getting caught up, a new show just went out today, so go look for

2310
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,240
it.

2311
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,640
We do have at least one email to read and it's from Australia.

2312
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:08,760
This is from Mike in Australia.

2313
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:13,080
Mike in Australia says, hello to all in studio, Rob, Loki, Silent Nathan and Rice Princess.

2314
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:14,280
Oh, he must be listening right now.

2315
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,280
Wow.

2316
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,280
Because he knew exactly who was on the show.

2317
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,280
Well, hello.

2318
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,160
I've had the opportunity to listen live two weeks in a row, which is a treat considering

2319
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:25,120
during your half-time Puppy Bowl music break, it's coming up to 2 p.m., so generally I'm

2320
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:26,120
at work.

2321
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:29,600
Firstly, I want to ask your thoughts about some good platform games on the DS.

2322
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,200
I don't have an Xbox 360 or PS3, so I'm stuck with the DS Lite, which is good enough at

2323
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:34,200
the moment.

2324
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:37,800
I've acquired Castlevania, Order of Eclatia, but haven't really gotten into yet, played

2325
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,400
the first level or so.

2326
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:43,440
I'm slowly playing through Yoshi Island DS, so if you can suggest anything similar, that

2327
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,440
would be good.

2328
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,280
Before I finish, I just want to say great show as always and really enjoy listening

2329
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,360
to your shows.

2330
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,840
Take care and hope to listen live again soon.

2331
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:55,600
Mike, PS, this email is not sponsored by anyone, but for you guys to learn a new Australian

2332
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:02,640
term, budgie, bud, budgie smugglers, I guess the email's brought to us by budgie smugglers.

2333
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:06,840
Explanation from Urban Dictionary, Australian slang term for men's tight-fitting speedo-style

2334
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:07,840
swimwear.

2335
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:11,280
The lump in the front apparently resembles a budgie when it is stuck down the front of

2336
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,280
someone's shorts.

2337
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:13,560
That's a budgie.

2338
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,160
That's what I want to know.

2339
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,960
Is that like a Snuggie?

2340
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,040
Oh, I bet it is.

2341
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,120
That's like the Australian version of a grape.

2342
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,120
I mean.

2343
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:24,120
Alright.

2344
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,120
Look, look, back to the question at hand.

2345
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,520
How about some DS platform games?

2346
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,600
You know, I haven't played a whole lot on DS as of late.

2347
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:33,560
I just, I have this thing against playing games on DS for some reason.

2348
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:37,200
I like playing games on the TV, but to help our poor guy out.

2349
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,200
What are some games?

2350
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:41,920
See, even when I'm playing the DS, I'm playing a lot of RPGs, like Final Fantasy IV or Mario

2351
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,920
games.

2352
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,920
Is this no good DS games?

2353
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,920
No.

2354
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:45,920
Well, platformers specifically.

2355
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,440
Like things like Castlevania, Yoshi Island, what are some other good platform games?

2356
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,320
New Super Mario Brothers is definitely like one of the classics if you don't have that

2357
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:54,320
yet.

2358
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:55,320
You gotta get that.

2359
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,320
I'm gonna look to chat too for some hints.

2360
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,320
Chat.

2361
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:58,320
What are some good ones?

2362
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,320
The new games that have come out.

2363
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:06,400
Of course, there's the new Kirby game, Kirby Superstar Ultra, which is, you know, port.

2364
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:13,800
And then there's, was it the Chase Phoenix meets Felicity.

2365
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:18,040
That's supposed to be kind of like Kirby's Canada's Curse.

2366
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:22,400
And then, other platformer games, I'm sure there's a lot of crappy games that have come

2367
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,280
out that have been like platformers.

2368
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:27,040
Wasn't N out on DS, didn't they release a version of N?

2369
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,700
Yeah, that's kind of a neat little game.

2370
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:31,440
That's coming out, or that's already out.

2371
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:35,040
And then, you know, I don't know.

2372
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,180
Game Guru in chat suggests Sonic Rush.

2373
01:50:37,180 --> 01:50:39,520
It's better than the console Sonics.

2374
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:43,840
You would definitely also have to pick up the Chrono Trigger for the DS.

2375
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:48,520
It's not a platform game, but it's way better than any of the games you've already mentioned.

2376
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,720
Also a budgie is a bird.

2377
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:51,720
Like a parakeet.

2378
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:53,720
Oh, thank you.

2379
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,720
Seriously?

2380
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,200
I feel like I learn new things on this show every day.

2381
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,200
The more you know.

2382
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,200
There you go.

2383
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:01,200
The more you know.

2384
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:02,200
Alright.

2385
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,200
There you have it.

2386
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:04,200
Yay.

2387
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,800
I don't know if any of you in the chat room do agree with Sonic Rush.

2388
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:06,800
So there you go.

2389
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,880
If you don't own that one yet, you should probably check out Sonic Rush.

2390
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:12,240
Hitstun though suggests Tony Hawk's American Skateland.

2391
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,040
It's kind of a platform game.

2392
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,040
Sorta.

2393
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:16,040
Yep.

2394
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:17,040
Yep.

2395
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,440
So there's some suggestions from us to you.

2396
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:21,320
If you have an email you want to send us, mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, I'd like

2397
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:25,340
to hear more international slang terms, like budgie smugglers.

2398
01:51:25,340 --> 01:51:28,120
That was definitely educational.

2399
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,880
There you go.

2400
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,340
What'd you say, Nathan?

2401
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:37,320
Next time you put on a Speedo, look down and it will resemble a parakeet in your pants.

2402
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:40,840
I don't think there's going to be a next time I'm going to put on a Speedo.

2403
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:45,420
If I wear- On Naturale.

2404
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:50,640
If I go swimming, I wear like, you know, swimming trunks, not, you know, in this country it's

2405
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:55,060
not appropriate usually to wear Speedos to the beach unless you are really good looking

2406
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:59,040
and I'm not really good looking, sadly, so there you go.

2407
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,400
People do it anyway.

2408
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:01,400
That's true.

2409
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:07,720
The Tron guy wears that whole thing in public, so whatever.

2410
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,720
Let's go on.

2411
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,280
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

2412
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:13,960
We'll get to the Skype line soon also, by the way, you guys, Skype line opening up a

2413
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:14,960
little later.

2414
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:20,680
Well, here's a game if you're a fan of the Jump Superstars games that they have on the

2415
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:21,680
DS.

2416
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:30,440
There's a new Konami PSP brawler coming out and no word on, let's see here, what the title

2417
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:39,760
is on it, but it's got- Oh, Sunday X Magazine is the- I guess it's just all the different

2418
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:45,160
manga characters, but they've got, you know, Sunday X Magazine Tyson Action and it's got

2419
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:57,400
everything from, you know, Samurai Deeper Kyo to Get Backers, Air Gear, what is it,

2420
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:02,660
so it's basically all the stuff that's like, you know, from Shonen Sunday Weekly Shonen,

2421
01:53:02,660 --> 01:53:06,800
so the Shonen Jump games, so very awesome.

2422
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:18,160
Project Arms, Inuyasha, I don't know, actually, you know, Jump Ultimate Stars was okay.

2423
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:23,080
It was a neat fighting game on the DS, it was kind of like Smash Brothers a little bit,

2424
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:28,720
but the way that you use, like, they had a bottom portion of your screen that you can

2425
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:35,040
align different manga panels and you'd get different abilities and assist characters

2426
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:39,480
and stuff like that based on what you had in there and you had to fit them in, so it's

2427
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:45,200
almost like the sticker system on Smash Brothers Brawl, so it's kind of neat.

2428
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,200
I see.

2429
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:49,080
Boy, these Smash Brothers Brawl clones are sure getting popular lately.

2430
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:51,600
I remember you brought up the one about the Ninja Turtles last week and that was like

2431
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,600
confirmed on Monday.

2432
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:58,200
Well, yeah, some of the people did Brawl, or not Brawl, Smash Brothers, so it's part

2433
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:04,920
of the same team, so it's going to be very similar to that, but this game, yeah, it looks

2434
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,400
pretty fun and we need good, you know, PSP games.

2435
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:12,320
Alright, more PSP the merrier, I suppose.

2436
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:16,320
Sega is going to be trying to make a new arcade game, which sounds kind of interesting.

2437
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:22,360
It's called Border Break, Sega Network Robot Wars, and it's a networked robot wars, of

2438
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:23,360
course.

2439
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:27,960
Arcade game that's being made by Sega, apparently it's going to be shown at the next AOU show

2440
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:34,880
that's coming up in Japan, 20 players in this game, 10 on 10 robot battles, so this is like

2441
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,840
the kind of thing that is going to be very expensive, you're going to see in the corner

2442
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,840
of a Dave and Busters or something like that, I don't think this is something you're going

2443
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:47,280
to see very much of, this is like an entertainment setter, 20 mech things, that's a lot.

2444
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:48,280
That's crazy.

2445
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:49,280
That's awesome.

2446
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,280
I know, I want to play it.

2447
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,640
It's awesome, but I don't think you'll ever see one on these shores.

2448
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:55,560
Just arcades aren't popular enough over here, maybe a Dave and Busters would be like your

2449
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:56,560
biggest bet.

2450
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:01,960
Well, you may not have to have 20 cabinets, but I mean, it still could be, you know, cool.

2451
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:05,840
Yeah, it might be cool, but I don't know if you're going to see it, that's all.

2452
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,480
It's probably going to be expensive.

2453
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:11,680
I don't think there's enough arcade stuff to justify it, sadly.

2454
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:15,620
So, we'll see, we'll see, but anyway, it is in development.

2455
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:19,760
There's another unique game, which I'm not really sure what arcades are going to be carrying

2456
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:24,680
this because it has a lot of parts that go along with it, but it's a game that's come

2457
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:29,920
out, or coming out in Japan, called Block Pippo.

2458
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:36,760
And what it is, it's a game that's controlled with Lego-style blocks, and you actually build

2459
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:41,300
up platforms and stuff using these blocks, and there's like a giant bin below the screen

2460
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:44,760
with these blocks in there, and you build platforms for the characters to run on, kind

2461
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:49,240
of like Lemmings, almost, by the look of it.

2462
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:55,720
It actually is being tested for the U.S. as well, under the name Brick People, but it's

2463
01:55:55,720 --> 01:56:00,320
very unique looking, and it's got a lot of, you know, the block things that are going

2464
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,880
to be in this bin, and I just have a feeling, you put that in an arcade, kids are going

2465
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:10,880
to be stealing that shit left and right, but it's neat.

2466
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,440
Why can't kids just be more responsible?

2467
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:14,280
That's a good one.

2468
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:17,920
Yeah, Lioshin agrees, those blocks will get stolen so fast if it was in the U.S., they'd

2469
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,840
have to be all put on those cords.

2470
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,560
That would be a mess.

2471
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:25,760
You're like, crap, I can't put these blocks in there because of all these cords.

2472
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:28,760
Shit, I got stuck and tangled in these cords.

2473
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:30,760
That's the game.

2474
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,800
Help!

2475
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:37,440
Interesting games spotted around the gaming blogs this week, Go Nintendo featured this,

2476
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:41,840
a Wii homebrew game called Super Sonic Wii, but what's interesting about this game, I'm

2477
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,800
actually going to try to play the YouTube footage here in studio, a little clip of what

2478
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:50,000
the game looks like here, if it'll actually play, looks like it's timing out, but I looked

2479
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,600
at it a little bit before the show, it's a game that looks just like frequency or amplitude.

2480
01:56:54,600 --> 01:57:02,840
It's actually amplitude, it's based off of the game Amplitude DS, which was a spin off

2481
01:57:02,840 --> 01:57:06,680
of Amplitude, but now they have it for the Wii, and it looks pretty awesome.

2482
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:14,320
If you go to the actual website for the game, which I believe Super Sonic Wii.com or Super

2483
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:17,920
Sonic.com.

2484
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:21,480
There we go, there's a little clip of it.

2485
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:25,160
It's definitely a scaled down, all you can hear is the audio, but I'll tell you, it looks

2486
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:29,480
like a very scaled down version of Amplitude, because you don't really have the hypnotic

2487
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:34,920
backgrounds that a game like Amplitude had, it looks like you only have three tracks,

2488
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:42,360
but still, it's a start, it's something, it's bound to get sued, especially if that rumor

2489
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:48,160
from a few weeks back that harmonics might be making a comeback with this stuff is true.

2490
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,160
There it is, Super Sonic Wii.

2491
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:53,600
Well, you can download it now, it's available out there, so if you wanna check it out, you've

2492
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:58,160
got a homebrew enabled Wii system, definitely check this out, and of course if you have

2493
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:02,660
a homebrew enabled DS, you can check out Amplitude DS.

2494
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:06,600
Of course, homebrewing any of those systems might violate your warranty, so be careful,

2495
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,520
and don't say OLR told you to do it.

2496
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:17,440
You don't need that crap, seriously.

2497
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:24,400
But there's something else that's gonna be coming out here soon, it's a new Wii game,

2498
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:30,760
it's called Glacier 2, they're comparing it to Twisted Metal, except you drive down mountains,

2499
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:34,960
I would say it's more like full auto, but you drive down mountains, because I mean that

2500
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:40,960
was more like this game, I think, it's basically a combat racing game, and it'll have 18 different

2501
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:47,480
levels, it'll feature 7 different cars, all with giant guns and weapons on them, like

2502
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:55,360
any other car should have, and this is a brand new game from a company called Team 6 Studios,

2503
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,280
and this is their first Wii game.

2504
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:02,280
I don't know, looks okay, but hey, we need a good combat racing game, and since they're

2505
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:07,000
not making another full auto game, this will have to do, I guess.

2506
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,280
Actually, no, I take that back, there was another combat racing game on the Wii, it's

2507
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:18,040
called DT Racer, or DT Carnage, I think, what it was, and that's a combat racing game similar

2508
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:24,200
to full auto, not very good though, from what I remember, but you can try that out, it's

2509
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:28,080
probably like dirt cheap now.

2510
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:34,440
Well, some other games that got really cheap lately were the Need for Speed games, because

2511
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:38,760
apparently they did not sell very well, the recent games they released, so EA decided

2512
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:43,120
if it worked for Batman, it's going to work for us, they're going to reboot the franchise,

2513
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:46,720
so they're hitting the old reset button on the Need for Speed franchise, and they're

2514
01:59:46,720 --> 01:59:51,560
going to release 3 new Need for Speed games in the year 2009.

2515
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:56,500
What's interesting though is that the whole concept behind it, one for the core gamers,

2516
01:59:56,500 --> 02:00:01,000
one for the casual gamers, one for the online gamers, I think it's an interesting approach

2517
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,500
to take with the games.

2518
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:07,280
Need for Speed Shift is the game that's coming out on Playstation 3, 360, PC, and PSP, and

2519
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:12,620
that's the core game, that's like Project Gotham, coming out in the fall as well, Need

2520
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:17,400
for Speed Nitro, that's coming out on the DS and the Wii, which you can probably guess

2521
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:21,820
is going to be the casual game, I think that's more like the original Need for Speed games,

2522
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:27,000
it's also supposed to have giant head racers and car vaulting, lame, wait, car vaulting?

2523
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,800
God, I hope this is not another fucking game, wait, wait, wait, that might just be like

2524
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:39,640
a vault to actually put your car in, no, that's car vaulting, aww, stupid, no, why, wouldn't

2525
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,640
you like that?

2526
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:45,640
Well, I do like that, but you know, the fact that, car vaulting reminds me of the stupid

2527
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:52,400
Cruisin game that they had come out, and that Cruisin game was a ripoff, or actually a port,

2528
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:58,200
was it not Need for Speed, the Fast and the Furious arcade game, the crappy Cruisin USA

2529
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:03,320
based one, Cruisin World, I don't know, no, no, the Fast and the Furious game that came

2530
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:08,920
to arcades, not good, I didn't even know they had a Fast and the Furious game in the arcade,

2531
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:13,000
yeah, it's not good, it's based off Cruisin USA, I think it was kind of to try and compete

2532
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,400
with, like, you know how when you go to an arcade, one of the things you still see tons

2533
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:22,320
of people playing are what, Wangan, and uh, this is not even close, that's like saying

2534
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:27,520
that a turd is competing with a diamond or something, Tigerclaw says, you mean Fast and

2535
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:33,720
the Furious Tokyo Drift arcade, I seen that at Walmart, yeah, it's awful, that's where

2536
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:40,240
it belongs to, yeah, that's what Cruisin came out, that's actually what Cruisin was, alright,

2537
02:01:40,240 --> 02:01:44,240
also a third game in the Need for Speed series, not for the Wii, if the other two don't sound

2538
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:50,480
interesting to you, Need for Speed World Online, it's supposed to be a free online title, it's

2539
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:54,280
coming out in Asia first over the summer and then we'll get it in Christmas time, so I'm

2540
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:56,840
assuming you probably have to pay for car upgrades or something, you know, probably

2541
02:01:56,840 --> 02:02:00,760
based off the Asian model for MMOs where it's free, but then you have to pay for the good

2542
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:06,360
stuff, so, it's free, but your cars have no wheels, pay extra for the wheels, it's like

2543
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:13,200
go, oh crap, can't go, by the way, the games are all being developed by different studios,

2544
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:18,320
even though Black Box apparently kind of got, you know, kind of, well, pink slipped, a lot

2545
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:22,400
of them did, Black Box is still working on Need for Speed World Online, at least who's

2546
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:27,880
left with EA Singapore, Need for Speed Nitro, the casual one is by EA Montreal, it's arcade

2547
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:33,440
racer is what they're calling it, Need for Speed Shift coming by Slightly Mad, they're

2548
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:41,960
the guys that made GT Legends and Blimey apparently is on it too, GT-R2, Blimey! Wow. There you

2549
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:46,760
go, lots of Need for Speed in 2009, yeah, if you're a Need for Speed fan, that is exciting

2550
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:50,920
news, DarkTetsuya in chat I believe is a Need for Speed fan and says, it's supposed to be

2551
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:55,920
a fourth one, yeah, there's a fourth secret one, but, I don't know, hopefully that's the

2552
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:02,360
good one, Need for Secrets, and you can only play it if you find it, cause they're gonna

2553
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:09,520
hide it. Alright, and then of course we have to talk about the game that has download content

2554
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:16,280
coming out the wazoo, Burnout Paradise, they're actually, there's a new rumored download that's

2555
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:19,720
gonna be available, actually I wouldn't say it's so much a rumor cause it's actually on

2556
02:03:19,720 --> 02:03:27,120
their download store, but apparently it wasn't announced yet, so, oops, but it's a Burnout

2557
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:33,640
Paradise Police Cars, and they've got, you know, the actual link for it, but it says

2558
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:40,360
coming soon on the actual in-game store, and they do have some screenshots, I guess, I

2559
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:47,240
don't know if it's preview pics or something like that, of the PCPD cars, so maybe new

2560
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:53,040
game modes, some sort of chasing stuff, I don't know, Burnout Paradise is getting fucking

2561
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:57,920
awesome, and now meaning you can get the game for like 20 bucks, all the debt-free download

2562
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:01,560
content and all the paid download content is coming out. Much love to those folks for

2563
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:05,520
just continuing to support a game that might have gotten bashed as mediocre when it came

2564
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:11,120
out, but they still just expanding and expanding on it and making it pretty awesome, so, good

2565
02:04:11,120 --> 02:04:18,280
for you guys. We'll see, any time frame on when that could come out? No word, but I mean

2566
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:23,120
a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, like there's the Burnout Paradise, the new

2567
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:28,480
cars, I think that's coming out this week, I mean probably later on, maybe this month,

2568
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:35,360
possibly next, probably relatively soon. Alright, one more story for you guys tonight, then

2569
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:40,520
we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

2570
02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:43,360
I don't know how busy it's gonna be tonight with a lot of our regulars catching the Super

2571
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:47,160
Bowl tonight, and I guess even though it's over, maybe the office or whatever they're

2572
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:51,400
showing right now, you know, maybe a little drunk from all the beer at the Super Bowl

2573
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:55,680
parties, who knows, but we will open up the Skype line soon. One more story tonight and

2574
02:04:55,680 --> 02:05:00,720
it involves a company we talk about a lot on this show, PopCap. PopCap is finally bringing

2575
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:04,200
some of their games to the PlayStation Network, it actually happened this week, Bejeweled

2576
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:10,200
2 finally showed up on the PlayStation Network, and there also are plans to release Zuma,

2577
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:16,760
Heavy Weapon, Feeding Frenzy, and Pagle. I know Pagle's pretty awesome. Pagle hasn't

2578
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:21,320
even showed up on Xbox Live yet, so I'm curious if it'll beat it to the punch on PlayStation

2579
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:27,760
3, I kinda doubt it, they'll probably be released simultaneously, but there you go, $9.99 if

2580
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:33,640
you wanna check out Bejeweled 2, that's one penny less than what you'll pay on Xbox Live.

2581
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:38,340
I go where the bargain is. That's right. So there you have it, I don't think the game

2582
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:43,160
itself is much different, I think it's all the same modes from the Xbox 360 one, I don't

2583
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:47,880
know if the achievements are as hard, or excuse me, trophies, or what have you, but, there

2584
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:53,760
you go. Man, I love that game. What, Bejeweled? Pagle. Oh, Pagle. Pagle's pretty awesome.

2585
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:57,440
Pagle is pretty awesome. It is, I wanna play it now. So, well, you might get to play it

2586
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:03,340
on PlayStation Network soon, or Xbox 360, because I know you're a big 360 fan. Alright,

2587
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:07,820
so we're gonna go ahead and open up the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the

2588
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:13,280
US and Canada, or you can call us on Skype, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio, while we

2589
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:16,240
wait for some calls to come in, because we do have a little bit of a delay between when

2590
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:22,040
I say, hey, call in, and when people actually hear me say that on the radio. Loki, do we

2591
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:27,920
have any last minute stories tonight? Yeah, speaking of football, apparently there's that

2592
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:35,640
whole deal where the retired NFL players were not getting any money from the new NFL games,

2593
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:40,200
and their likenesses were being used without, you know, any sort of compensation. Well,

2594
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:45,900
they have now finished that whole lawsuit, and they are going to be getting paid out

2595
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:54,080
on it. So, that's pretty cool. In the tune of $28.1 million by the NFL. Only, let's go

2596
02:06:54,080 --> 02:07:00,520
to the Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? Hi, this is Spazinator. Hey, Spazinator,

2597
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:08,080
what's on your mind? Well, two things. First off, I just want to double check and make

2598
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:17,160
sure I heard you correctly in part A. Did you see that if you had the collector's edition

2599
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:23,480
of Gears of War 2, you're going to lose your golden lancer? No, only if you were one of

2600
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:27,560
the people that downloaded it while, I guess, it accidentally went up on the marketplace

2601
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:31,320
for free and so a bunch of people downloaded it, they want to restrict it so that only

2602
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:34,540
the people with the collector's edition actually have it. So, I don't know how they're going

2603
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:37,520
to figure that out. They're not going to. It's not going to happen. You don't think

2604
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,680
they'll actually be able to figure out? No, they're not going to figure it out. Loki's

2605
02:07:39,680 --> 02:07:43,100
convinced they're not going to be able to figure it out, but if you legitimately have

2606
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:46,380
the gold gun from the collector's edition, you're not who they're trying to remove

2607
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:52,300
it from. I kind of agree about that. Because by one of the people that had bought the collector's

2608
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:56,900
edition, I just hate to get my, you know, lose my feed me, you know?

2609
02:07:56,900 --> 02:08:01,340
Wait, hold on. I'm not much of a Gears player. What is so special about the gold gun or is

2610
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:02,100
it just that

2611
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:05,620
it's pretty? It's just a gold gun.

2612
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:08,700
It's just bragging rights more than anything.

2613
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:12,180
You know, something to say, hey, I got the special edition.

2614
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:15,300
You know, it's kind of like the Iron Rich

2615
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:19,300
application for the iPhone. I don't know. I kind of thought maybe it fired gold bullets or

2616
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:20,820
something. Alright, what was your second question?

2617
02:08:20,820 --> 02:08:24,820
Well, it's not so much a question, it's

2618
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:28,100
more like a stupid statement.

2619
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:32,460
Well, we make a lot of those on this show, so go right ahead. Yeah,

2620
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:35,740
I was just thinking, with all the talk about strippers in movies

2621
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:39,140
during part A, I doubt

2622
02:08:39,140 --> 02:08:44,620
it'll ever happen, but someone should make a game for Xbox 360 and

2623
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:49,220
PlayStation 3 where, you know, you go to a strip club and

2624
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:52,260
you know, you have boobies splashing in your face.

2625
02:08:52,260 --> 02:08:56,660
Kind of like, I don't know, like Show of Girls type of game.

2626
02:08:56,660 --> 02:09:00,300
That would be called This is Vegas coming out from Midway later this year.

2627
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:03,220
Awesome. What about that Playboy game?

2628
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:06,980
The Playboy Mansion? Yeah, that was actually supposed to be pretty good.

2629
02:09:06,980 --> 02:09:11,820
It was popular. You know, the problem is a lot of these games, you know, while you might see

2630
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:15,260
some boobs here and there, you're never gonna see anything pretty much

2631
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:19,020
more hardcore than that on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 because

2632
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:22,300
of the whole standards thing, where if you have,

2633
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:26,220
you know, if your game gets rated adults only, your game can't come out on any of

2634
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:28,420
the consoles. The consoles like basically forbid it

2635
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:32,060
because there's too many people out there who don't understand

2636
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:36,460
there's a developer who makes for the publisher who puts out on the system,

2637
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:40,800
you know, people think, oh, Nintendo Wii has got this disgusting,

2638
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,700
you know, vagina-eating game that's out on the system,

2639
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:48,420
you know. When is that getting released? It's not,

2640
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:52,900
because it's rated adults only, so it's not like it used to be back in the day

2641
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:56,580
where, you know, remember that Nintendo

2642
02:09:56,580 --> 02:09:59,860
seal of quality, you know, remember how those

2643
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:03,980
other companies would put out their own games without going through Nintendo and

2644
02:10:03,980 --> 02:10:06,540
it was kind of like a whole bootleg thing. They can't really do that now, so

2645
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:10,340
sadly, I don't think you're ever gonna see real hardcore games get released, but

2646
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:13,700
you would wish one of them would just let up.

2647
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:16,940
Or you can just look at porn on the internet.

2648
02:10:16,940 --> 02:10:20,260
There was that one game, there was some

2649
02:10:20,260 --> 02:10:25,580
breast game that was, it was almost like DDR that had these little like circles come up

2650
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:26,060
with like

2651
02:10:26,060 --> 02:10:29,420
arrows and stuff, and there are different moves you had to do, and basically you had to

2652
02:10:29,420 --> 02:10:30,620
shake this chest

2653
02:10:30,620 --> 02:10:34,020
and make the boobs either spin counterclockwise or clockwise or up and

2654
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:34,980
down, left or right.

2655
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:40,340
It was awesome. I don't know, porn on the internet's great, but I can see a

2656
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:42,620
lot of potential for the new

2657
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:47,020
Wiimote technology in a porno game.

2658
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:52,540
Exactly. Especially if the vagina eating game was either pigs in a trough type

2659
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:55,180
eating or knife and fork.

2660
02:10:55,180 --> 02:11:01,100
Frisbee has a great name in chat for the game, Muff Chomp.

2661
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:06,460
Wow. You know, since you kind of touched on it

2662
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,980
for a second, you know,

2663
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:13,060
this is just me, you know, speaking up on yes here, but

2664
02:11:13,060 --> 02:11:16,260
what I'm thinking is that, you know,

2665
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:19,940
game console owners should be

2666
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:23,500
afraid of 8-year-old games, you know, I mean,

2667
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:27,380
you know, if it means light, there should be no problems with it,

2668
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:31,900
you know, it's kind of like, the best analogy I can give you is with

2669
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:36,740
Amrita games, you know, there's two out there that are like completely opposite,

2670
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:40,180
there's the Grand Theft Auto series and

2671
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:43,580
the BMX triple X. Obviously,

2672
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:46,820
you know, Grand Theft Auto games are really great,

2673
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:50,460
you know, my few niece here is out there,

2674
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:53,660
whereas, you know, BMX triple X

2675
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:58,580
is just a full piece of crap. I gotta get BMX triple X again, I love that game.

2676
02:11:58,580 --> 02:12:01,500
Actually, I think my sister has it because I had it for the GameCube.

2677
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:07,020
That game is awesome. Loki really has like the best family ever, doesn't he?

2678
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:11,100
Like the wife goes to the GameCube, the sister plays BMX triple X.

2679
02:12:11,100 --> 02:12:15,380
It was a funny game, it's seriously, it's Tony, it's not Tony Hawk, it's like Matt

2680
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:16,740
Hoffman's Pro BMX,

2681
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:21,100
but with like nudity and stuff, and just ridiculous plotline, but it's basically

2682
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:23,980
like the old school Tony Hawk game. You know what, though, Spassinator makes kind of a

2683
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:25,420
good point, though, is that, you know, we have,

2684
02:12:25,420 --> 02:12:29,300
especially we have this whole dual thing in this country which stinks,

2685
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,700
this whole double standard where,

2686
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:34,180
you know, you could chop people in half and chop their heads off and have a

2687
02:12:34,180 --> 02:12:35,900
completely violent game and it's just not,

2688
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:40,140
it's R or it's M rated, but heaven forbid you show a cooter or a penis

2689
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:44,020
and it's gonna be an NC-17 or AO related thing,

2690
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:48,140
but he makes a good point that, you know, a lot of the sex games that we've had that

2691
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:49,500
come out, like the guy game,

2692
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:52,980
BMX triple X, they've all been kind of crap, you know?

2693
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:56,820
What we need is a good artistic

2694
02:12:56,820 --> 02:12:59,940
pussy eating game

2695
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:04,700
to come out, and we just need it to have, you know,

2696
02:13:04,700 --> 02:13:08,220
a little bit of art. It'll be like Master Pussy Theater.

2697
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:12,260
Master Pussy Theater, exactly.

2698
02:13:12,260 --> 02:13:16,740
Yeah, if you want to really kick it over the edge there,

2699
02:13:16,740 --> 02:13:20,340
you know, throw all that stuff in there, then just,

2700
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:23,380
you know, have like a side mission where you blow up a certain

2701
02:13:23,380 --> 02:13:27,060
ex-flory lawyer.

2702
02:13:27,060 --> 02:13:31,940
I'm sorry, but Master Pussy Theater needs to be in the OLR dream games, I think,

2703
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:34,940
just for the simple fact that it is that artistic

2704
02:13:34,940 --> 02:13:38,420
sex game that's gonna bring respectability to

2705
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:42,500
sex games. I'm afraid of the fetish achievements for those games on the

2706
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:44,740
Xbox 360.

2707
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:48,140
Alright, Spazinator, we have to let you go. You've completely made this show

2708
02:13:48,140 --> 02:13:49,220
disgusting tonight.

2709
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:52,740
How dare you? You're welcome. Alright, take care Spazinator.

2710
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:54,900
Bye.

2711
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:58,780
AcidicVampire wants to remind us there's boobies in God of War in a sex minigame.

2712
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:03,140
There is. Hi, you're on Booby Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2713
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:06,340
Oh, Booby Lounge Radio! How exciting!

2714
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:10,060
Whoa! Hi guys, it's Jason. Hi Jason, how are you? What's on your mind?

2715
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:14,220
Well, now that you mention it, I don't know that I want to explain on air

2716
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:15,140
what's on my mind.

2717
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:19,740
What did you call in to discuss tonight with the Orange Lounge Radio host

2718
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:22,760
on this family program? As long as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly

2719
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:27,580
are alive and spewing their shit, your dreams will never come true, I'm sorry to say.

2720
02:14:27,580 --> 02:14:31,260
No, that's not why I called in, but it was very funny. It was a very

2721
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:36,300
funny anecdote to add into everything that just happened. I'm hoping somebody can answer me

2722
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:37,140
because

2723
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:41,420
obviously I heard this just recently and it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

2724
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:45,780
Why does Gears of War need SSL and why does it stop the game from working?

2725
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:50,900
The whole Gears of War broken blah blah blah. Does anybody know the technical

2726
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:51,780
reason behind that?

2727
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:55,380
It's because the certificate expired.

2728
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:58,740
What is the certificate actually used for?

2729
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:03,140
Nothing. And it blocks the game in its entirety?

2730
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:08,100
Yeah, sure. I don't know. I don't play Gears of War on PC

2731
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:11,780
and it's such an easy fix to set my date back, I'm like, eh, whatever.

2732
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:15,900
Is it some type of thing to prevent cheating or the connection to

2733
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,700
multiplayer mode is secure or what?

2734
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,900
Maybe the authenticate that it's a legit copy of the game, I don't know.

2735
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:22,980
It's gotta be something like that, like authenticating the legitimacy of the game or

2736
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:26,300
something like that. I don't know. I don't think it has a direct impact on the

2737
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:27,700
game itself,

2738
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:31,220
Jason, or I think the 360 ones would have stopped working too. I think it has

2739
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:32,780
specifically to do with

2740
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:36,740
some type of authentication thing on the PC. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.

2741
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:39,660
Some kind of a phone home connection, something or other, and that's just,

2742
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:43,780
that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I mean, we've heard of some really

2743
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:45,260
stupid DRM, but

2744
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:49,300
for crying out loud people,

2745
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:53,460
it's laughable. You put the situation where you have to,

2746
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:57,940
you have to have a patch. One of two things has to happen. You either have to

2747
02:15:57,940 --> 02:15:58,500
buy

2748
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:01,980
a ridiculously expensive certificate for,

2749
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:05,660
I don't know, 10 years and then you piss off all the nostalgia players.

2750
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:09,260
Or you have to issue a patch every single

2751
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:13,740
year with a new certificate. Well, I think this is going to be a tough lesson learned because this is a

2752
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:18,420
pretty big fuck up to have your game completely stopped working. It's a bad setup. They need to get rid of that

2753
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:21,620
entirely. That is a bad

2754
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:25,220
mechanism. Okay, enough computer geekery.

2755
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:28,700
You guys mentioned that and I just kind of...

2756
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:32,620
They've been having trouble with this sort of thing way back from Monkey Island. They have yet

2757
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:38,420
to get this right. If you remember way back on the really old DOS games, you used to

2758
02:16:38,420 --> 02:16:40,900
buy a game and it'd come with a little booklet

2759
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:45,220
and at certain times you'd have to refer to page 193 line B65

2760
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:48,700
or you'd have some awful

2761
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:51,820
little card you have to match up with the moon on

2762
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:56,660
the solstice of winter just to prove that you did in fact buy the game.

2763
02:16:56,660 --> 02:17:01,340
And if you lose it, you're fucked! Some of those things weren't so bad and with the

2764
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:01,860
internet

2765
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:05,300
I've had a lot of things be subtly replaced.

2766
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:08,660
Anyways, Space Quest,

2767
02:17:08,660 --> 02:17:11,700
the Space Quest series came with a

2768
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:14,900
brochure of sorts to explain about the game and it had

2769
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:18,300
in the case of Space Quest V, which was one of my favorite ones,

2770
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:22,300
it had like a star chart with constellation codes or

2771
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:25,700
something like that and you had to use those codes to actually

2772
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:29,780
warp to different locales in the game as the story tells you to go there.

2773
02:17:29,780 --> 02:17:32,980
And that was their DRM and it was good, it was cute.

2774
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:36,260
Jason, what I didn't like about that whole thing is that then console games started

2775
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:36,860
doing it

2776
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:40,580
and like, you know, if I didn't have that letter from home to dip in the water to

2777
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:41,900
see the secret code...

2778
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:44,980
I didn't have that letter

2779
02:17:44,980 --> 02:17:48,540
because I bought my game used and I had to call their helpline and I'm like,

2780
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:51,820
uh, they'll dip the letter in the water and I'm like, what letter?

2781
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:54,900
No, the one in the manual. I don't have the manual.

2782
02:17:54,900 --> 02:17:58,940
Okay, the code's 747. Well, it wasn't that hard.

2783
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:02,500
Couldn't you just tell me that the first thing or do you like not get your 99 cents a

2784
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:03,900
minute if I, you know,

2785
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:08,020
give it away that fast? People will say that DRM is a necessary

2786
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:11,860
evil, I'll tell that person you're full of shit. By the way, yeah.

2787
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:15,100
It's self-serving and it only serves to

2788
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:18,500
fuck people over. Hold on, Nathan wanted to say something about Space Quest V.

2789
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:22,460
Did you also enjoy blowing up an android with a banana?

2790
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:25,780
A space banana? That was, um,

2791
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:30,780
when I was a lot younger, the BBS's were around, but that was the extent of my

2792
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:31,620
online life.

2793
02:18:31,620 --> 02:18:36,540
I love Space Quest IV. That was as far as I could get. I never got to the R&R world.

2794
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:40,100
So I, as many times as I played the game, I always

2795
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:45,780
oh, I don't even remember what that planet is called anymore. I always got that far and then that was the end of it.

2796
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:49,220
And that was the whole game for me for about five years of my life.

2797
02:18:49,220 --> 02:18:52,820
I was more of a King's Quest player and I wish to God those games would come out on

2798
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:56,220
like Xbox Live Arcade, although they're on like GameTap and stuff, so you know.

2799
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:59,900
You're entirely wrong in your preference, but you know what, a lot of people were.

2800
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:04,460
Hey, King's Quest has that rabid fandom. I remember

2801
02:19:04,460 --> 02:19:07,780
about a year or two ago on this show we had those guys- Silver lining?

2802
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:11,100
Yeah, the Silver Lining, which was originally like a King's Quest-inspired thing and

2803
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:13,980
then they were allowed to put it out if they ditched the King's Quest thing and

2804
02:19:13,980 --> 02:19:15,940
you know, that whole mess that was going on there.

2805
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:20,180
I can't say anything bad about King's Quest. The Sierra Adventure games in general were really

2806
02:19:20,180 --> 02:19:21,260
impressive. I just

2807
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:26,320
Hell yeah. I never had one. I never played one. Space Quest wasn't my series. Something sadly lacking in gaming

2808
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,580
today unless it says Telltale Games on it.

2809
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:32,820
They're the only ones doing anything, you know? Anyhow.

2810
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:36,660
Anything else, Jason, you wanna talk about tonight before we get some other calls? Do you guys

2811
02:19:36,660 --> 02:19:40,940
really think that Bioshock really needs multiplayer?

2812
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:44,780
No. I personally don't think it needs multiplayer. I think the first one was

2813
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:45,980
good enough as it is.

2814
02:19:45,980 --> 02:19:48,980
But I can see why they want to put it in the second one

2815
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:52,860
to definitely make it not feel like more of the same. Because you know,

2816
02:19:52,860 --> 02:19:56,340
I think otherwise some people might start to say, well, it's more of the same.

2817
02:19:56,340 --> 02:20:00,100
You know, it's another sci-fi. You know, no matter what the story is or what they do

2818
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:01,580
with it, there's gonna be people out there that say

2819
02:20:01,580 --> 02:20:04,660
it's more of the same. But if they throw this multiplayer curve at it,

2820
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:07,820
people are gonna be like, oh my gosh, it's like the must-have game of

2821
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:10,980
da-da-da. You know, it almost makes me think they left it out. It makes it just like every other

2822
02:20:10,980 --> 02:20:12,860
first-person shooter with a different weapon set.

2823
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:17,800
I mean, the one thing as much crap as I gave Bioshock because the

2824
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:18,380
ending,

2825
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:23,060
the last hour and a half or so of it just absolutely pissed me off. It was so

2826
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:27,900
boring and then it ended with the easiest boss battle I think I've ever seen in a game.

2827
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:31,420
Bioshock, what made

2828
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:35,340
the best thing about Bioshock was the story.

2829
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:38,700
It was interesting. It was scientific fantasy,

2830
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:42,100
sci-fi. It was a

2831
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:48,220
good story. Being able to find the story and if you actually sat down and

2832
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:49,140
paid attention to it.

2833
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:53,080
I mean, you know, I'm not an ADD gamer so maybe I have a little bit of a

2834
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:55,380
different look on the game than some other people.

2835
02:20:55,380 --> 02:20:59,260
But the story made that game incredible

2836
02:20:59,260 --> 02:21:02,620
until the end. But that was the best part about it and

2837
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:07,580
you lose all that in multiplayer. It's more... I really shouldn't say this, but it's more

2838
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:08,180
humdrum.

2839
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:11,660
It doesn't necessarily mean though, Jason, that the focus is gonna be on multiplayer.

2840
02:21:11,660 --> 02:21:14,420
They might still have a very solid single-player mode in it and the

2841
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:16,700
multiplayer might just be an afterthought type thing.

2842
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:19,700
That's very true. I just did.

2843
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:23,860
A lot of... when you guys mentioned it and I went article surfing, it was just like

2844
02:21:23,860 --> 02:21:27,580
they're finally getting multiplayer. Oh my god!

2845
02:21:27,580 --> 02:21:32,380
Well, because there's a whole audience out there that does play first-person

2846
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:33,100
shooters to

2847
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:37,060
do the multiplayer and, you know, it was missing for them in the first Bioshock.

2848
02:21:37,060 --> 02:21:40,580
Maybe they don't see the same thing in it. I can't talk it. It's just kind of... it

2849
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:43,900
seems overbearing in the pre... in everybody's view.

2850
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:47,700
We'll see. Alright, Jason, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls. But you have a

2851
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:48,120
good one.

2852
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:51,380
Thanks, buddy. Fine. Jeez, come on. Sorry.

2853
02:21:51,380 --> 02:21:54,420
We try to keep it to five minutes and you're on eight. Alright.

2854
02:21:54,420 --> 02:22:01,420
See you, buddy. Bye. Bye. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is

2855
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:02,740
OrangeLoungeRadio.

2856
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:06,900
SSJ100Matt says, apparently not having multiplayer in a game hurts a game.

2857
02:22:06,900 --> 02:22:10,300
Sorry if Legend of Zelda doesn't have multiplayer. Hey, but there was that

2858
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:11,220
Four Swords game.

2859
02:22:11,220 --> 02:22:15,100
That was kind of awesome. Remember that? On the GameCube? Yeah. I like that game.

2860
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:20,020
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? It's GS68.

2861
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:25,780
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind? Um, so I found out I'm playing DD Max Fever.

2862
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:29,020
Oh, the new one in the US? The one that just came out?

2863
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:32,100
Yeah, the American one. And I know you're a big...

2864
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:36,820
It's a good game on its own. I mean, I know you're a pretty good pick from Portable 1 and 2, but

2865
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:42,700
as far as, like, buying it if you've already into the series, I can't really recommend it.

2866
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:47,500
I mean, you might as well just get Portable 1 and 2 and get the full silence from both games.

2867
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:52,260
Yeah, I'm kind of interested in your review here, because I know you're a big

2868
02:22:52,260 --> 02:22:55,980
DJ Max fan, so it's kind of interesting to hear you kind of give this a negative

2869
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:56,900
review, but what if,

2870
02:22:56,900 --> 02:23:00,340
what if I'm somebody, you know, because I am somebody, personally, who's not really

2871
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:03,860
played a lot of the DJ Max game? I mean, I have a friend that's obsessed with it, too,

2872
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:07,300
so I've, like, seen it. I've seen a couple of videos. I've not really sat down and

2873
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:08,980
spent any quality time with the game.

2874
02:23:08,980 --> 02:23:12,840
Let's say I'm a person who's never really seen or heard of DJ Max before. Is this a

2875
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:14,020
good introduction game?

2876
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:23,420
Um, I can't really say yet. I don't play it much, but it's pretty decent, but there's,

2877
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:29,260
one thing that's biting me about this game, and it's the whole author-correct feature.

2878
02:23:29,260 --> 02:23:30,940
What is this feature?

2879
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:37,580
Basically, if you press the wrong button for a note, but at the right time, the phone is

2880
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:42,860
on the same side of the screen as the note is, you still get 100%, the full percentage

2881
02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:48,300
for it, and you still get some points for it. And I'm on a game site as DJ Max Zero

2882
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:53,020
Board, and I'm seeing newbies saying, oh, so I can just press any button to play the

2883
02:23:53,020 --> 02:23:58,460
game? So what's the point of the notes and such, and this, I think, is a bad idea.

2884
02:23:58,460 --> 02:23:59,560
That is kind of strange.

2885
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:00,560
Yeah, because then you can just go like do-do-do-do.

2886
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:03,640
I don't really dubs it down. Yeah. You can't turn that off?

2887
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:04,640
Press two buttons, I think.

2888
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:05,640
This seems a little silly.

2889
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:11,860
I can't. I mean, yeah, you get 80% of the points, but you still get full credit as far

2890
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:14,260
credit as far as your percentage goes which means

2891
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:17,260
you can start pressing the wrong notes at

2892
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:20,520
all the time and still get one hundred percent

2893
02:24:20,520 --> 02:24:23,980
percentage at the end of the song. Well now this begs the question who the hell did

2894
02:24:23,980 --> 02:24:27,280
they make this game for then because you know i would think oh this is kind of

2895
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:30,740
like you know a little reward for the people that have supported DJ Max in this

2896
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:33,880
country you know they're going to finally release it in the US but if most

2897
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:36,720
people that are interested in this game are people that have already imported

2898
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:38,740
the other copies then what the hell's the point

2899
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:42,620
because they didn't really put anything in this game to really woo a new audience to it

2900
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:46,560
you know and if they did it's the most casual of casual players who just want to slam any

2901
02:24:46,560 --> 02:24:49,160
button they can to get a high score

2902
02:24:49,160 --> 02:24:52,600
well they had to uh... the people that imported them

2903
02:24:52,600 --> 02:24:56,620
you know they were real fans but this is one that they actually sent out to the

2904
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:59,220
stupid american pig dogs

2905
02:24:59,220 --> 02:25:05,780
well it's not as bad as say butt and groovy

2906
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:06,860
i mean

2907
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:10,860
it is pretty good for a relief on its own but when you compare it to the other

2908
02:25:10,860 --> 02:25:12,200
releases

2909
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:13,640
it feels kind of outdated

2910
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:14,520
and

2911
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:17,860
this one worked the exclusive songs and they're not that good

2912
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:22,780
well that's unfortunate i guess uh... who knows maybe maybe if it sells okay

2913
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:25,380
they'll do another one maybe not

2914
02:25:25,380 --> 02:25:29,280
i guess a few licenses would have hurt i mean hey they did positive edition which

2915
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:32,600
is a licensed game

2916
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:35,100
what's that

2917
02:25:35,100 --> 02:25:36,240
i mean

2918
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:39,340
yet i don't think that you have any if you like and that's one of her big area

2919
02:25:39,340 --> 02:25:40,720
in

2920
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:42,940
the report on the tradition is

2921
02:25:42,940 --> 02:25:45,240
license

2922
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:48,320
that's true i was saying the last thing on the show just needed a little bit of

2923
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:51,440
americanization to help it penetrate the market even though it might have pissed

2924
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:52,880
some of the hardcore fans off

2925
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:55,840
it would have in the long run benefit of the game is always sold more copies but

2926
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:58,560
no

2927
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:02,280
well anything else in your mind gs sixty eight

2928
02:26:02,280 --> 02:26:03,640

i'll do the status but

2932
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:14,240
maximum two and three dx came out but

2933
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:19,880
i don't want to talk about it because no one cares about it it's not that great

2934
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:22,760
it is a new course and

2935
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:25,000
has twenty more stages and

2936
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,480
kind of that's about it basically

2937
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:31,380
alright well if fans of the series then should keep an eye out for that for more

2938

2946
02:26:55,460 --> 02:26:58,260

gaming news and of course with the super bowl and everything else going on

2948
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:04,800
at least you got stripper talk if nothing else tonight so it was it was a

2949
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:08,040
good show i had quality show did you have fun rice princess

2950
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:11,320
i had a great time well thank you so much for being here do you have any

2951
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:13,500
final thoughts for our listeners tonight

2952
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:20,260
resident evil five resident evil five oh i i should go to loki though first and ask if there's any last minute stories or he'll yell at me

2953
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:23,580
i'm not gonna yell at you i don't really care

2954
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:25,280
let's see here

2955
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:28,180
i was gonna say uh... there's a couple things real quick

2956
02:27:28,180 --> 02:27:32,880
if you have a launched a three sixty it's no longer under warranty

2957
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:35,680
as of uh... february second

2958
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:39,080
uh... your three sixty if it gets three rings of death

2959
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:40,220
you're screwed

2960
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:43,500
and you gotta pay ninety nine dollars get the unit fixed

2961
02:27:43,500 --> 02:27:44,520
or

2962
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:49,920
just buy a new one

2963
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:52,780
or you just you know pay someone else to fix it for you

2964
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:54,340
for probably less

2965
02:27:54,340 --> 02:27:58,440
if you uh... pay the ninety nine dollars to get it fixed is it uh... a new warranty

2966
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:01,120
or do you have to pay ninety nine dollars if it breaks the next day i

2967
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:05,400
think it's a one-year warranty

2968
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:07,360
if mine red rings of deaths again

2969
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:09,660
although i didn't get mine i mean i would still be covered i think for a

2970
02:28:09,660 --> 02:28:12,120
couple more months

2971
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:13,560
i'm not sure actually

2972
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:15,460
how long was the warranty three years three years

2973
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:19,240
from purchase date i think mine's up in february you can well you can look on

2974
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:23,560
the back of your three six you'll say when it was manufactured and then some

2975
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:27,000
you know three years after that because i mean i've got

2976
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,920
quite a few systems so

2977
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:33,080
luckily i think all mine have crapped out the ones that were going to crap out

2978
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:37,280
i have one left that's of my original and i have my other one that i fixed

2979
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:39,780
so the one that fixed is actually still working very well

2980
02:28:39,780 --> 02:28:43,840
uh... and then i have one more that like i said that hasn't been replaced yet but

2981
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:45,840
all the other ones have so

2982
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:50,600
you know four out of six is not a good uh...

2983
02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:52,600
good ratio no

2984
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:56,680
anything else last minute stories tonight

2985
02:28:56,680 --> 02:29:00,200
all right then silent nathan thank you for being here and being so quiet do you

2986
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:03,500
have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight

2987
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:09,240

2988
