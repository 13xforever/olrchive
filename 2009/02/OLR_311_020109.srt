1
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:15,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, February 1st, 2009.

2
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:18,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Could Wii Photo Printing come to the US?

3
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:23,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Gears of War PC breaks down and multiplayer comes to the next Bioshock game.

4
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:32,644
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

5
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:57,669
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

6
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:16,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, she's been updating her Twitter.

7
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:19,848
[SPEAKER_05]: If you follow DarkSakura on Twitter, she's been updating her Twitter pretty regularly.

8
00:01:19,888 --> 00:01:21,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically the equivalent of help me.

9
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Please send help.

10
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss Wi-Fi.

11
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:25,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Help me.

12
00:01:25,912 --> 00:01:29,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So joining us tonight, we have a different female perspective.

13
00:01:29,815 --> 00:01:32,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to the one and only Rice Princess.

14
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:33,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

15
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:34,678
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Rice Princess?

16
00:01:35,238 --> 00:01:35,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm all right.

17
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:36,719
[SPEAKER_10]: How about you?

18
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:37,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Not bad.

19
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:37,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Not bad.

20
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you caring about the Super Bowl that's going on right now as we're doing the show?

21
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Resident Evil 5 Resident Evil 5

22
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:56,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I've played all of the games.

23
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:58,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Even 4 and 1?

24
00:01:59,105 --> 00:01:59,405
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them?

25
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:00,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

26
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:04,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I were like a billionaire, I'd recreate the mansion.

27
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:05,348
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the movies?

28
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a big fan of the movies?

29
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:07,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually do like the movies too.

30
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

31
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,211
[SPEAKER_10]: They're awesome.

32
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:13,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard some rumor, I don't think it made the show roll tonight, some rumor there's a fourth one that's going to be made pretty soon.

33
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:17,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it should keep going or do you think they need to pull the plug now?

34
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:20,257
[SPEAKER_10]: It depends on where they take the story.

35
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:27,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, because this last one that they came out with was an original story, and it was just, I don't know, it was alright.

36
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:31,066
[SPEAKER_10]: If they go back to the game story stuff, that would be cool.

37
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,629
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll also say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

38
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Lou, how you doing, Loki?

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine, I'm trying to find the Transformers 2 trailer.

40
00:02:38,972 --> 00:02:44,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently the link that we had in our chatroom, it's not working, or at least it works, but it's not playing.

41
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:49,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the real reason why people watch the Super Bowl, the commercials and the movie trailers.

42
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:59,279
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if the smart people would realize that you can actually watch commercials before they come out on the Super Bowl, or at least for most of the trailers, well, not trailers, but commercials.

43
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,520
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually have a website that had some.

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I was watching them earlier.

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,361
[SPEAKER_06]: They suck.

46
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, some of them suck, but most of them were not good.

47
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:08,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Regeneration

48
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:27,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to give a special shout out to the chatters tonight because they are here during the Super Bowl.

49
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, they're either football haters or they are very loyal listeners of Orange Lawn Radio.

50
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:36,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We only have probably about, you know, there was no Bobby tonight to lead into our show.

51
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:38,076
[SPEAKER_05]: He took the night off for the Super Bowl.

52
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:42,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And we probably only have, between everything that's been going on, probably about a third of the usual listeners we have.

53
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,402
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to really thank those folks that were loyal and staying tuned tonight.

54
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:52,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to thank, joining us tonight in studio, say hello to Silent Nathan is here again.

55
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,987
[SPEAKER_05]: No, seriously, how are you, Nathan?

56
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:57,627
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

57
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:58,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine.

58
00:03:58,847 --> 00:03:59,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a motorcycle.

59
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:01,288
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a motorcycle?

60
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:02,928
[SPEAKER_05]: What game do you have a motorcycle in?

61
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:04,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know you don't have one for real.

62
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:06,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I would have wanted to ride in the sidecar.

63
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:08,809
[SPEAKER_05]: World of Warcraft.

64
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:09,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd.

65
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:10,430
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

66
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Describe to the listeners what having a motorcycle means in World of Warcraft, and how exactly does it fit into the lore?

67
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:26,145
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes vroom, vroom, vroom, and then you can make it jump, and it's lore-wise...

68
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:29,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

69
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:30,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a motorcycle.

70
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:30,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

71
00:04:30,595 --> 00:04:31,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a motorcycle.

72
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:52,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Horde, so I usually have to kill the princesses and destroy the castles.

73
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:58,460
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's at least 12,000 gold just for Vendormat.

74
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a lot of money.

75
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, congratulations on your motorcycle.

76
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:06,044
[SPEAKER_05]: One day I will come back to WoW and I will ride in your motorcycle in the sidecar.

77
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:06,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

78
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:09,485
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to come back within a month, otherwise you can't.

79
00:05:11,448 --> 00:05:15,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But if I stay away for three months, then somebody can use the Scroll of Resurrection on me.

80
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,032
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the whole plan, actually.

81
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:26,476
[SPEAKER_07]: You should actually cancel your account, start a whole new account, and we can be the leveling buddies and we'll get awesome mounts.

82
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:27,437
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

83
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:36,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks in a segment we always like to start off the show with called, How was your gaming week?

84
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:37,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

85
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:38,582
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

86
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:42,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It was still not that eventful, but more eventful than last week.

87
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:50,348
[SPEAKER_06]: More Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360, still playing stuff, which is, you know, it's fun.

88
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:54,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to the new expansion they have coming out in the future.

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,452
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

90
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:22,916
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:48,477
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

92
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:16,521
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

93
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So which, of course, that person posted that everywhere on the internet.

94
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:46,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So now there is literally an official no DVD patch for the game.

95
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:52,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've made it pretty easy to pirate the game, I guess.

96
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:59,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, technically you're not supposed to be able to pirate it because you still have to authenticate it and the serial number and everything like that to play online.

97
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:03,549
[SPEAKER_06]: But trust me, you don't really have to because it's

98
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:04,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

99
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:23,595
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360

100
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to do a system restore to get a game to work.

101
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:12,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Any game.

102
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:15,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Crysis I had less trouble running.

103
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:18,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And goddamn Crysis is a bitch to work.

104
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:23,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And sadly enough, Crysis actually runs better than Grand Theft Auto 4.

105
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's telling you something.

106
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:31,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And trust me, Grand Theft Auto 4 is not... Crysis is definitely not pushing the graphics that Crysis was.

107
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I think AcidicVampire in chat sums it up very well.

108
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:35,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a love-hate relationship for Loki.

109
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a love-hate relationship.

110
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,057
[SPEAKER_05]: You love to hate it.

111
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:40,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else for your gaming week?

112
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

113
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:47,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to ask for our spinoff show Orange Lounge Foodio.

114
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,557
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pretty excited about the food you brought to the show tonight.

115
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:52,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell our listeners about this fine new cuisine of yours?

116
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:57,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fine cuisine, but they have these new things at Burger King called Burger Shots.

117
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:05,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're basically... Like when you first said the name, I was like, what popped in my head were the dessert shots from Applebee's and stuff.

118
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:08,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, ew, that does not sound appetizing at all.

119
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Putting a hamburger in a glass.

120
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:13,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, putting hamburger and ketchup and mustard in a shot glass.

121
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:14,655
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disgusting.

122
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:14,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

123
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,856
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're sliders.

124
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:19,458
[SPEAKER_06]: They're little mini hamburgers, basically.

125
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:20,078
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy them.

126
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,780
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a two-pack and a six-pack.

127
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you want a two-pack?

128
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:25,602
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to get fat?

129
00:10:25,742 --> 00:10:26,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

130
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,284
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're okay.

131
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,405
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all right.

132
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:35,608
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the second time I've had them, and it's just kind of okay now.

133
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as good as their normal burgers.

134
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,732
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have the smoky, flame-broiled taste to it.

135
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:41,892
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're okay.

136
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:42,493
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of neat.

137
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:43,597
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

138
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about your gaming week.

139
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to gaming, Rice Princess.

140
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:11,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm going to play the demo of Resident Evil 5, and that's going to be my gaming week.

141
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:12,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's all you're going to play.

142
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:17,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I might turn around and suddenly Rice Princess is gone, and so is my Xbox 360.

143
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:22,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Or your PS3, because I wouldn't... I don't think they have the demo on PlayStation 3, actually.

144
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, what?

145
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:25,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was on your PS3.

146
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:26,982
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's on my Xbox 360.

147
00:11:27,022 --> 00:11:27,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Aww.

148
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:29,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be like that.

149
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still like that.

150
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:52,194
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there were a lot more games that came out.

151
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:54,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a lot cheaper.

152
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:55,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still going to play it.

153
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:58,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to put on gloves or something.

154
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pretend it's something else.

155
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:03,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why you have this rampant hate for Xbox, but whatever.

156
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:06,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Xbox hate is so like five years ago.

157
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're all kind of over it now.

158
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:09,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just extreme dislike.

159
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:10,331
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

160
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:32,348
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

161
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:33,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

162
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:34,370
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week.

163
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week.

164
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:40,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a lot of the old stuff, you know, Fable 2 and same stuff I've been playing.

165
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:48,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, though, thanks to a very, very, very kind listener, I've got a code for Left 4 Dead now, so I'm going to be playing that on PC this week.

166
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited.

167
00:12:50,883 --> 00:13:18,404
[SPEAKER_05]: and to follow up a question that came up last week there is an Orange Lounge Radio Steam community out there and I was able to find it very easy by going into Steam and just searching for Orange Lounge in groups so I joined it so there's about like 30 some odd people in the Orange Lounge Radio Steam group so if you are a Left 4 Dead player you're listening to this show I encourage you to join our Steam group because I'll probably be playing Left 4 Dead and I want to play with listeners but you have to promise to be nice to me because I suck at first person shooters so even

168
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:18,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

169
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:37,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

170
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:37,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

171
00:13:57,188 --> 00:14:26,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Pirate server that you can play on for free and I'm okay with talking about it on the show because Sega kind of turns a blind eye to the whole thing because they turned their servers off a while ago so they just kind of let this thing run so it's interesting it's kind of tough to play because I can't do a lot of the quests because they're all in the Japanese text still but it's Phantasy Star Online and it's free so I can't complain I don't think I'll play it forever but ah memories wow how long ago did that come out?

172
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:29,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, if the Dreamcast is about 10 years old, right?

173
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:30,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreamcast came out in 1999, right?

174
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the first Phantasy Star Online is probably about 9 years old.

175
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Holy crap.

176
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's an old game.

177
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:38,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

178
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:44,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, there's not a lot of action-based MMOs like that.

179
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even really call Phantasy Star Online an MMO, though.

180
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:47,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is and it isn't.

181
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:52,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an MMO like, wow, you go off, everything's like Instance.

182
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:54,869
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more Guild Wars, I guess, than anything.

183
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not even like that.

184
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,730
[SPEAKER_05]: It is pretty cool, though.

185
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

186
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:00,753
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really stood the test of time.

187
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:04,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though a lot of people hate on Universe, I don't mind Universe.

188
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:10,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have Phantasy Star Online for my Dreamcast because I remember I always would play it offline.

189
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:18,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I would never play it online because I had dial-up at the time, so it didn't really make.

190
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,867
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be kind of hard, yeah.

191
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:23,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, they did have a dial-up modem in Dreamcast.

192
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:31,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently this server will let you connect the Dreamcast one, the PlayStation, wasn't there a PlayStation one?

193
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:34,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, the GameCube one I know was on there, and the PC one.

194
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,036
[SPEAKER_05]: You can connect all those together on this one server.

195
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:39,596
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Blueburst, right?

196
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:45,319
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use either the Blueburst client or the Dreamcast client, and it's episode one, two, and four.

197
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play them all together.

198
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So, which I thought was kind of cool.

199
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:54,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Just not the Xbox one, because the Xbox one was through Xbox Live, and so there's no way you can play that anymore.

200
00:15:54,864 --> 00:16:00,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Sega shut down the server, and you can't really hack Xbox Live servers without a lot of problems.

201
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:05,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can, but... Again, it's not something I think I'm going to play a long time.

202
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,531
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, nostalgia is pretty cool.

203
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:11,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, honestly, the cave level gets so boring after a while.

204
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:13,114
[SPEAKER_10]: It totally does.

205
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:14,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you even played PSO?

206
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:15,236
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

207
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:15,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

208
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

209
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:46,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, poor Loki.

210
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:48,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, everyone else had PlayStation.

211
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:53,266
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the only reason I had Dreamcast is because I wanted to accuse our all-nighter event.

212
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, okay.

213
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:55,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

214
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:58,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Dreamcast are still awesome.

215
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:02,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because of the fact that you can boot, like, there's a lot of homebrew stuff for Dreamcast.

216
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:10,790
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was actually, I'm looking to find a, because I'm not going to try to buy it.

217
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw that shit.

218
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:17,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to find a copy of Super Runabout for the Dreamcast.

219
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:21,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Because for some reason, like, I thought of this one game that I played before.

220
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:24,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Felony 1179 that was on the PlayStation 1.

221
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:28,805
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's a pretty fun game.

222
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:29,427
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like...

223
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really like Burnout, but it's a racing game where you're supposed to crash into a lot of stuff.

224
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:37,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, cause a lot of property damage.

225
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:42,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you'd play through the game, you'd unlock more cars, kind of like Burnout.

226
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:47,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, ridiculous stuff, like, you know, meter-made cars, buses, and just all sorts of crazy stuff.

227
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: But Super Runabout was kind of the same game, same type of thing, and it was just really stupid fun.

228
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:58,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a game they should really, you know, make a new one of, because you'd be left on Burnout with...

229
00:17:59,198 --> 00:17:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Collateral Damage.

230
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:03,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to find that so I can play that again.

231
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:06,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite a bit of Dreamcast love coming from our chat room.

232
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:10,583
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Leo Shen saying, I still play Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on my Dreamcast all the time.

233
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:12,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that game so much.

234
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:12,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you own a Dreamcast?

235
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:16,064
[SPEAKER_10]: We did own a Dreamcast, yeah.

236
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:22,926
[SPEAKER_05]: TGM-GS6, there's no easy way to pronounce that, says, I need to revive my Dreamcast so I can play Border Down.

237
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:26,867
[SPEAKER_05]: They keep releasing these homebrew things every year for Dreamcast.

238
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:30,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking today, actually, while I was playing PSO, because it got me thinking about the Dreamcast.

239
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,268
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dreamcast isn't even 10 years old yet.

240
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:32,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

241
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:35,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that old of a system, all things considered.

242
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Still pretty interesting, all the things you can do on it.

243
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:45,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask Silent Nathan real quick how his gaming week was, and then we'll move into tonight's news.

244
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Nathan, how was your gaming week?

245
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:51,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes a long time to make enough gold to buy a motorcycle.

246
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:54,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So wow wow and more wow?

247
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,959
[SPEAKER_05]: See, enough said from Silent Nathan.

248
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

249
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:00,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin.tv.com.

250
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:18,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to say thank you.

251
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:25,788
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with it though, when we tried to hook it up, we were able to get video but no audio because the video and audio was separate on it.

252
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:30,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So we thought it would be kind of lame to just have the video thing on Justin.TV.

253
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:37,194
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a cord coming that's going to fix our problems, but it's just not going to get here until this week sometime because it's coming from New Jersey.

254
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:42,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really, really, really, really hoping we will be back up on Justin.TV next week.

255
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, very excited about that.

256
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:51,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then when you come over looking all pretty in the future, Rice Princess, it won't be for nothing, as you did a couple weeks ago.

257
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

258
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:52,829
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

259
00:19:54,251 --> 00:20:00,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, also, of course, there's no DarkSakura tonight, but she will be back next week on the program, and, uh,

260
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,988
[SPEAKER_05]: No shows off or anything coming up for us.

261
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:08,095
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just cranking right through up until our 7th anniversary this June, if you can believe it.

262
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:12,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly some conventions in our future.

263
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I am toying with the idea of going to ASEN.

264
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:17,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know it's very cheap to fly out to Chicago right now on Southwest?

265
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:18,609
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

266
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go.

267
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do the panel and the whole nine yards.

268
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'd have a lot of fun.

269
00:20:42,915 --> 00:20:44,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure DarkSakura wants to go.

270
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's wife probably won't let him go.

271
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:47,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't want to go either.

272
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,322
[SPEAKER_05]: But who knows?

273
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:51,823
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see.

274
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:52,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try.

275
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:52,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try.

276
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me, if I'm going to go to one show this year, it's going to be E3.

277
00:20:57,849 --> 00:20:58,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, E3.

278
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:01,132
[SPEAKER_05]: You know E3 registration opened up this week, actually.

279
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:03,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got to talk offline about that.

280
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

281
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:22,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Before the end of this year.

282
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,733
[SPEAKER_06]: We were saying we're going to go originally to Seattle.

283
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:30,437
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really much that we really want to do in Seattle.

284
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Prosser.

285
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:33,500
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the party's at this weekend.

286
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,545
[SPEAKER_06]: We were going to go to possibly LA to go to Disneyland, that kind of stuff.

287
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:41,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be around her birthday, and her birthday is the 4th of June.

288
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,050
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the week before.

289
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,551
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that is the week of E3.

290
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:50,716
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 is like June 2nd through 4th, I'm not even kidding you.

291
00:21:51,537 --> 00:21:52,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, fuck that.

292
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:55,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, let me look.

293
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was like the 13th or something.

294
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:01,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Just be like, happybirthdaybabe, you get entrance into E3.

295
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all these video games I got you.

296
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:06,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you a goodie bag from E3, yeah, June 2nd through 4th.

297
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:07,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, you ass!

298
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's no way I'm going to E3 now.

299
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:14,812
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just be like, but babe, you can get a bunch of swag.

300
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's not going to fly.

301
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:19,996
[SPEAKER_10]: You can walk around a bunch of smelly nerds.

302
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:21,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that will not fly.

303
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:26,340
[SPEAKER_05]: You should at least try to get down for one day, get back in time for her birthday or something.

304
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:28,139
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

305
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:43,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

306
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:45,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you can pull some strings now.

307
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,331
[SPEAKER_10]: You have connections, dude.

308
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:47,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, right.

309
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,192
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously.

310
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:51,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, back when we went in 2005, we were still kind of fledgling.

311
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:52,254
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

312
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:56,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also had friends that worked at a certain game company.

313
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:56,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Different places.

314
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:03,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I should say, because I don't know if the game company knows that they inadvertently let us in E3, but we got those tickets.

315
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

316
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:09,343
[SPEAKER_10]: We could bring our old badges from 2005 and be like, look, we went in 2005.

317
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:13,065
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they specifically have made it like you have to reapply even if you went before.

318
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:13,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

319
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:13,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

320
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:14,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

321
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll worry about that in the upcoming weeks.

322
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:16,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We got time.

323
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:17,467
[SPEAKER_05]: We got time.

324
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,367
[SPEAKER_05]: We have at least till May.

325
00:23:18,808 --> 00:23:19,048
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

326
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:22,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, we got to get into the gaming news tonight.

327
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:24,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, get us into some gaming news.

328
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:30,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's not that exciting, but we may be getting a new channel soon.

329
00:23:30,513 --> 00:23:31,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently...

330
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:34,755
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a trademark.

331
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:37,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is, I think, coming to Europe first.

332
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:50,499
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a trademark on the European Trademark Database that suggests that Nintendo is looking to bring its Digicam print channel to Europe and potentially elsewhere as the photo print service channel.

333
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:58,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically what the Digicam print channel is in Japan is it's a service offered through Fujifilm.

334
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:04,583
[SPEAKER_06]: That of course allows you to print photos that you save to an SD card and you can upload them.

335
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:06,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Off Your Photo Channel

336
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:33,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's kind of useless, but, you know, whatever.

337
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,590
[SPEAKER_06]: New service is, you know, new.

338
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,470
[SPEAKER_10]: That it is.

339
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

340
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:43,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something, you know, you're a Nintendo fangirl, Rice Princess.

341
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:44,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something you'd want to use?

342
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:45,192
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

343
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:46,052
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no?

344
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:48,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a printer at home.

345
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:51,694
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I didn't, I might consider it.

346
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:52,934
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

347
00:24:55,215 --> 00:25:01,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other things coming to the future in Nintendo's world is the Wii Fit Body Check channel.

348
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:02,175
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

349
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:29,840
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii Fit Body Check Channel It's going to be something that's launching on the Wii in April I guess what this game does, it uses your BMI data That's your body mass index that you get from Wii Fit And you get the step data from personal trainers walking pedometer This is in Japan, by the way, because I don't think we have that game here yet And you get some personalized guidance from health experts Walk more, fatty!

350
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay healthy!

351
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:34,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

352
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:54,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

353
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:59,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Active Health might be the DS game.

354
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:06,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of Personal Trainer Walking, it's Active Health or some sort of... I don't know.

355
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see it tying in with Wii Fit and stuff and maybe them doing an update to Wii Fit.

356
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, incorporate data from that.

357
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:34,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

358
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:41,339
[SPEAKER_05]: What extra kind of tips are you going to get from these health professionals who don't even see you?

359
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,281
[SPEAKER_05]: These games do nothing about your diet, do they?

360
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:49,603
[SPEAKER_05]: If you really want to lose weight, it has to be an eating and exercise thing, right?

361
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:52,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything I've ever heard said that.

362
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:54,328
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have to eat less calories.

363
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:57,109
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where personal trainer cooking comes into play.

364
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Personal trainer cooking, mama?

365
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,231
[SPEAKER_06]: No, personal trainer cooking.

366
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,654
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they'll give you recipe ideas and stuff like that.

367
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:10,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And then somehow your being fat will be attributed to your not being good at math.

368
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where personal training math will come into play.

369
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,721
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

370
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:16,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew that was the reason why I was fat.

371
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:22,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, So, Nintendo is releasing this, but not Mother 3.

372
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:24,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Jerks.

373
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:25,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding, I live in Nintendo.

374
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, is Mother 3 going to get you in shape?

375
00:27:27,368 --> 00:27:28,148
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think so.

376
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Think of the greater good.

377
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of the children.

378
00:27:31,871 --> 00:27:34,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Would soccer moms be interested in Mother 3?

379
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:35,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

380
00:27:36,493 --> 00:27:36,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

381
00:27:36,993 --> 00:27:38,434
[SPEAKER_05]: But a personalized health coach?

382
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:41,396
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what every soccer mom prays for before they go to bed.

383
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:42,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

384
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:42,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

385
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:46,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's some pretty cool news.

386
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:51,896
[SPEAKER_06]: This week they announced that there's going to be a sequel to Boom Blox coming out, Boom Blox Bash Party.

387
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:55,398
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have some additional levels and some other fun stuff.

388
00:27:55,778 --> 00:28:00,381
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's also kind of neat is they announced... That sounds really close to Boom Blox Bachelor Party.

389
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,142
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

390
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:40,654
[SPEAKER_06]: and there will not be any additional security measures as far as friends codes go but then again this is an EA game so you know maybe they're going to have that stupid way to sign up for like EA servers or something like that but still that's not friends codes and

391
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:48,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting it's taken this long for somebody to finally defy the friend code system.

392
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:54,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of us thought it was impossible that if you wanted to do the online Nintendo thing, you had to do friend codes.

393
00:28:54,282 --> 00:29:00,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what makes this story notable is not necessarily who or what game is doing it, but the whole fact that it can be done.

394
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:07,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and the other thing that's interesting, you might remember that there was that rumor before that there was going to be a major game that would not use friend codes.

395
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:08,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

396
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Boom Blox is a major game?

397
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:12,575
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually is.

398
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:14,257
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a pretty major game.

399
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:18,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It sold really well, the first one, and it's been a pretty fun puzzle game.

400
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, though, the puzzle games need some tits in them.

401
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:24,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Gal's Panic.

402
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:25,202
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no.

403
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:26,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've gotten into this on the show before.

404
00:29:26,822 --> 00:29:27,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Gal's Panic I fully approve of.

405
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:28,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

406
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:30,403
[SPEAKER_06]: But not all puzzle games need tits in it.

407
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:33,924
[SPEAKER_06]: If you will remember, Bubble Bath Babes, not a good puzzle game.

408
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:35,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody bought it.

409
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:36,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a start.

410
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:38,886
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Rome wasn't built in a day.

411
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:48,987
[SPEAKER_05]: They tried, and I don't know why that was never further explored, but why did Miss Nude World have to stop at 96?

412
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:50,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

413
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:55,571
[SPEAKER_10]: And remember in Leisure Suit Larry they came out with one a couple years back?

414
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:57,812
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that did pretty well, didn't it?

415
00:29:58,072 --> 00:29:58,212
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

416
00:29:58,332 --> 00:29:59,533
[SPEAKER_06]: How did Leisure Suit Larry do?

417
00:29:59,553 --> 00:29:59,593
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

418
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:03,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, but I thought that was like a cult franchise or something.

419
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

420
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:04,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

421
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:20,036
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on hold right now because Sierra, which is part of Vivendi Universal, well, Vivendi Universal got bought up by Activision, and all their properties are kind of being sold off and redirected.

422
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:22,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's still in the works.

423
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:25,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's supposed to be... Well, right now, I think we had it dated for...

424
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:34,314
[SPEAKER_06]: April, but I don't think it's going to come out in April, but probably this year, and it's Leisure Suit Larry's box office bust.

425
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:36,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

426
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:43,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, see, this is the little, you know, Larry, and he has to help his uncle, Larry, who's the original Leisure Suit Larry, and...

427
00:30:44,466 --> 00:30:47,067
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're in Hollywood and oh, it's funny.

428
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:50,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's like cartoony women with big boobs.

429
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:53,550
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll have sex with him eventually.

430
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,290
[SPEAKER_10]: They get drunk.

431
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to find an audio clip of that song from Miss World New 96.

432
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:00,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we used to have it years ago on this show.

433
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've played it before.

434
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:03,533
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's been years.

435
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:07,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It fits the mood so well too for a puzzle game.

436
00:31:07,355 --> 00:31:10,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, here's a puzzle game that's going to be coming to WiiWare.

437
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Bubble Bobble on WiiWare.

438
00:31:13,157 --> 00:31:13,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Bubble Bobble.

439
00:31:41,828 --> 00:31:45,271
[SPEAKER_06]: The NES game pissed me off, especially when you had that special, was it level 99?

440
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:49,194
[SPEAKER_06]: They had to do something special to get to the levels beyond that?

441
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:50,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

442
00:31:50,435 --> 00:31:53,358
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be 400 stages in this new WiiWare version.

443
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:53,978
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

444
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:01,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to have a full recreation of the original Bubble Bobble, some higher difficulty levels if you are so inclined.

445
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:02,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the other cool thing, though.

446
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:09,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the new WiiWare won four-player local co-op, because you might remember the original was only two, and a brand new enemy.

447
00:32:11,107 --> 00:32:13,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one, but a brand new enemy.

448
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:17,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's going to be download content for this game as well.

449
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:19,878
[SPEAKER_05]: 200 points a pop for the download content.

450
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,141
[SPEAKER_05]: No word though how much the game itself is going to cost.

451
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:23,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine probably like $800.

452
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:24,604
[SPEAKER_05]: $4 million!

453
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,710
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the download content will be 50 additional stages of high difficulty.

454
00:32:30,703 --> 00:32:32,524
[SPEAKER_05]: and a unique boss character in each one.

455
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they should go all out with this.

456
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:44,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Release an external peripheral that you can attach to the Wii via USB and it would be a bubble blowing machine so that as you're playing the game it would blow bubbles at you.

457
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:48,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen those in Home on PlayStation 3.

458
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:50,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen those?

459
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:54,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Randomly in the mall on Home there's bubble blowing machines for no particular reason.

460
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:58,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time you blow a bubble in the game there should blow another bubble out

461
00:32:59,372 --> 00:32:59,753
[SPEAKER_06]: at you.

462
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:00,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be kind of funny.

463
00:33:00,954 --> 00:33:01,615
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be pretty awesome.

464
00:33:01,635 --> 00:33:03,496
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be very immersive if you did that.

465
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:07,541
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a whole 4D type of gaming I don't think has been explored yet.

466
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:07,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.

467
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:10,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Bubble Bobble featuring real bubbles.

468
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:12,726
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Smell-O-Vision, but better.

469
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:14,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say.

470
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:16,810
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to patent that idea, Loki.

471
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:17,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick.

472
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:18,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

473
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:25,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that I'm really going to get my feelings hurt if someone actually releases a bubble blowing machine.

474
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:28,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course then, the bubble blowing machine, it breaks after 30 bubbles.

475
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:29,728
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the downside to it.

476
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:30,829
[SPEAKER_08]: That's ridiculous.

477
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:31,589
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very limited.

478
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:37,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Nintendo revealed their launch schedule for the second quarter.

479
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:38,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to read this comment.

480
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:42,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I've been reading this guy a lot tonight, but the stuff he's been saying is funny.

481
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:45,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire says, Bubbles are fabulous.

482
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes me feel like Amy Adams in Enchanted.

483
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:50,205
[SPEAKER_05]: or Glenda the Good Witch.

484
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:51,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

485
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I get it.

486
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:55,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, read the damn next story.

487
00:33:55,829 --> 00:34:05,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Well anyways, not really, I mean, I guess the second quarter, but everything that they've announced so far for 2009, not a big surprise.

488
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:07,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Japan, they've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

489
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:10,379
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a sequel to...

490
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:17,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what they call over there Famicom Wars, which is Advance Wars over here.

491
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:21,509
[SPEAKER_06]: DS2 is coming out sometime in 2009.

492
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:24,470
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a Tomodachi Collection.

493
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out in 2009.

494
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,812
[SPEAKER_06]: New Picross game is coming out in March.

495
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:33,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario & Luigi RPG 3, which is scheduled to come out over there.

496
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, finally an interesting sounding game.

497
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,095
[SPEAKER_06]: February 11th.

498
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:48,780
[SPEAKER_06]: and then on the Wii of course they've got their new play control games Mario Power Tennis coming out actually it's already come out over there that was January 15th

499
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:59,668
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, there's another code, R, which is Trace Memory, is what they called it over here on the DS, but that's on the Wii now.

500
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,053
[SPEAKER_06]: New Play Control, Metroid Prime, also Pikmin 2.

501
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:10,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Metroid Prime's coming out in a couple weeks there, and Pikmin 2 in March.

502
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:14,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Sports Resort sometime in the spring.

503
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that's going to be over here as well.

504
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:20,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Sin and Punishment 2, of course, sometime this year.

505
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:26,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Endless Ocean 2, Hoshino Kirby, Lion Attack Heroes.

506
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:27,958
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a weird name.

507
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Chibi-Robo, they're going to do a new play control for that in Metroid Prime 2 as well.

508
00:35:34,522 --> 00:35:36,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they have some really weird names.

509
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:40,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Cosmic Walker, I guess that's a space version of Endless Ocean.

510
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:41,927
[SPEAKER_06]: You're kind of space walking.

511
00:35:42,547 --> 00:35:48,089
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Dynamic Xan, Spurn Smashers and Punch Out.

512
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's interesting.

513
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's the one game that had a lot of people excited previously was Punch Out.

514
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:57,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometime it's going to be coming out.

515
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:04,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, in the U.S., some of the stuff's already been announced.

516
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:07,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire Emblem, Shadow Dragon, that's going to be coming out in a couple weeks.

517
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:09,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Platinum in March.

518
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:11,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Personal Trainer Walking.

519
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:12,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember on the DS?

520
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,462
[SPEAKER_06]: That might go in with a whole rumor there that that's actually going to come out over here, that update.

521
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:20,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out sometime in 2009.

522
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:22,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhythm Heaven coming out sometime in 2009.

523
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:25,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, early April for that one.

524
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:29,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario & Luigi RPG 3 coming out at some point.

525
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:32,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to guess probably May for that.

526
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,092
[SPEAKER_05]: How long does it freaking take to localize a game?

527
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:36,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhythm Heaven's not coming out until April?

528
00:36:36,953 --> 00:36:38,994
[SPEAKER_05]: They were teasing that one at PAX last year.

529
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:42,615
[SPEAKER_06]: April 5th, whatever.

530
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:47,797
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the DSi sometime spring or summer of 2009.

531
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:51,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So that April rumor might actually come true.

532
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:57,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the Wii, we've got Mario Power Tennis coming out in March as well as Pikmin.

533
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are both coming out actually I think the same day.

534
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Sports Resort sometime in the first half of the year.

535
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:04,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Punch-Out also in the first half of the year.

536
00:37:04,383 --> 00:37:07,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably Wii Sports.

537
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:07,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to

538
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Walk With Me, Do You Know Your Walking Routine?

539
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:34,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Which comes with two activity meters.

540
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:37,054
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it wasn't Twin Peaks Firewalk with me.

541
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:38,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know your firewalking routine?

542
00:37:39,976 --> 00:37:42,177
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting Mario & Luigi RPG as well.

543
00:37:42,577 --> 00:37:46,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Platinum sometime in the first half of the year.

544
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Who killed Laura Palmer?

545
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,241
[SPEAKER_05]: You better moonwalk to find out.

546
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:52,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Kirby Superstar Ultra is also coming out over there.

547
00:37:52,343 --> 00:37:55,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And then DSi Hardware sometime spring or summer.

548
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:59,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course they're getting almost the same stuff as far as the...

549
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Play Control Games, Pikmin coming out February.

550
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:06,494
[SPEAKER_06]: That's surprising that they get Pikmin way before us.

551
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:09,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Power Tennis is coming out in March.

552
00:38:10,197 --> 00:38:11,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Fire, walk with me.

553
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:14,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

554
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:20,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Punch Out the First Half of the Year, New Play Control Pikmin Sorry, I just don't give a shit about Nintendo right about now.

555
00:38:20,903 --> 00:38:31,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii Sports Resort is coming out in 2009, right in the first half, and Sin and Punishment 2, another code R, so they're getting another code, and Endless Ocean 2 also coming out over here.

556
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:35,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing anything that will probably have some more stuff that's unannounced.

557
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:38,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously they haven't announced what they're going to be talking about yet.

558
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:43,682
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 and just a thought, probably not going to be interesting.

559
00:38:48,740 --> 00:39:04,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I guess there's a couple Unless they announce Excite Truck 2 in which case I will give them I will apologize for everything I've said but unless there's an Excite Truck 2 that's really the only stipulation Excite Truck 2 or they can get the hell out

560
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:07,809
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

561
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:23,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo DS!

562
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:23,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo DS!

563
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:53,528
[SPEAKER_05]: and defacing property at Nintendo World in New York City.

564
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:54,509
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

565
00:39:54,609 --> 00:40:05,219
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they decided to get back at Nintendo for not sending Bob a development kit is that he got some of his friends together who, for some strange reason, look like a bunch of foreign tourists that were probably recruited.

566
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the picture of Bob?

567
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,441
[SPEAKER_06]: When they showed him?

568
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:08,061
[SPEAKER_05]: In the very beginning.

569
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:09,002
[SPEAKER_06]: In the beginning of the video.

570
00:40:09,082 --> 00:40:09,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw him.

571
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't he look like a tool?

572
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:17,285
[SPEAKER_05]: He just, he does just kind of, he does, yeah, he just, he looks like an asshole.

573
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:19,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly.

574
00:40:19,646 --> 00:40:20,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

575
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:26,267
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, you just, yeah, you see these girls are going into the Nintendo World store and everybody's filming things going on here.

576
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:27,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why they didn't call security.

577
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:31,949
[SPEAKER_05]: But they tape posters to the side of the store that say Bob's Game.

578
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:36,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And they end up, I don't know, handing out flyers to all these people, just interrupting this

579
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Being generally rude.

580
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:41,674
[SPEAKER_06]: They slip in business cards into a bunch of the different games.

581
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:46,358
[SPEAKER_06]: They put mock boxes up onto the shelves.

582
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just basically generally harass people.

583
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And just act like assholes.

584
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:51,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Really.

585
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:53,825
[SPEAKER_05]: If Jamie was here, she'd be having a field day right now, honestly.

586
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:54,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

587
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:56,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even imagine.

588
00:40:56,227 --> 00:40:58,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me add that, okay?

589
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:02,833
[SPEAKER_06]: For one, Bob's Game, great that you made a game all by yourself.

590
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:03,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

591
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:04,314
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

592
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:16,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of people have done that, and they have taken their game online, whatever, and we don't really hear too much about it, but the fact is, just because you made a game by yourself does not mean it needs to be played.

593
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that, he just dumped a bunch of business cards on the floor.

594
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:20,514
[SPEAKER_05]: What an ass.

595
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:26,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta know what the chatroom thinks about this.

596
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:29,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And then let me say the other thing.

597
00:41:29,158 --> 00:41:32,560
[SPEAKER_06]: His game does not look good, and trust me, he doesn't seem that creative.

598
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob's game?

599
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:34,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

600
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:36,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're gonna call it?

601
00:41:36,402 --> 00:41:37,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob's game?

602
00:41:37,743 --> 00:41:38,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

603
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:43,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there is a game actually coming out by Graffiti Entertainment.

604
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:44,306
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the ones publishing it.

605
00:41:44,706 --> 00:41:46,287
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a game called Black Sigil.

606
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:51,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget what it was originally called, but it was a homebrew DS...

607
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:52,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Game Boy Advance

608
00:42:20,928 --> 00:42:26,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, his game could probably get published by the same company if he really tried, but he's an asshole.

609
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:30,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, you know, at first I felt bad for him because he couldn't get development kit.

610
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:31,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit now.

611
00:42:31,338 --> 00:42:34,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's an asshole and I fucking, his game looks like shit.

612
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:41,228
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like something made with like the old RPG maker and it really does not look good at all.

613
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:44,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not buy this game, especially after all this shit he's been pulling.

614
00:42:44,691 --> 00:43:02,729
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat says fucking douchebag even if his game came to the DS I wouldn't buy it GS68 says for fuck's sake look at Pixel or Nigero or whatever they don't get paid for their shit and they don't care and says this should be an OLR stupid award of the year and Acidic Vampire says he's being a whiny little bitch

615
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,134
[SPEAKER_10]: He pretty much is.

616
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:06,015
[SPEAKER_10]: What is he hoping to accomplish by doing all this?

617
00:43:06,035 --> 00:43:06,335
[SPEAKER_05]: For real!

618
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:11,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do you think anybody at Nintendo, like executives, is actually going to hear about this?

619
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:11,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my!

620
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,460
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing all of this stuff!

621
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,802
[SPEAKER_10]: We should publish, or, you know, put your game out.

622
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:15,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know!

623
00:43:15,423 --> 00:43:17,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.

624
00:43:17,925 --> 00:43:20,167
[SPEAKER_06]: He's probably going to release it as a ROM or something.

625
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:22,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And still no one's going to download it.

626
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,749
[SPEAKER_05]: He put the video on the internet.

627
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know how stupid that is?

628
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:35,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now there's video out there of you essentially vandalizing the property and making the scene here at the Nintendo World Store or whatever.

629
00:43:35,774 --> 00:43:37,815
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think they might come after you?

630
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:44,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you, Miyamoto, to come out with the Master Sword and just chop them in half.

631
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:46,259
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be awesome.

632
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:49,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, this guy does not need any more of our time.

633
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:51,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be honest, I don't give a shit if your game ever gets published.

634
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:57,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, release it in the homebrew community or something like that, because you know what?

635
00:43:58,033 --> 00:43:59,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone's going to give a shit.

636
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,955
[SPEAKER_06]: The game doesn't look that great.

637
00:44:01,075 --> 00:44:05,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it has all this gameplay and stuff in it, but it doesn't look that good.

638
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:06,658
[SPEAKER_06]: It really doesn't.

639
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:08,759
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason that this should be published.

640
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:13,040
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in chat says, Bob's been blackballed from the video game industry.

641
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

642
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the blogs need to stop giving this guy any attention at all.

643
00:44:19,842 --> 00:44:20,762
[SPEAKER_10]: We should too.

644
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:22,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

645
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:25,823
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a dickface and he's a crappy game developer.

646
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:26,923
[SPEAKER_10]: The end of the story.

647
00:44:27,183 --> 00:44:27,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

648
00:44:28,224 --> 00:44:33,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say though, I want to put a request out there to the OL Army.

649
00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:38,086
[SPEAKER_05]: If you see this guy getting any more coverage on blogs out there or whatever, please...

650
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:44,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave a comment, email the blog, and ask them to please stop giving this guy attention.

651
00:44:44,366 --> 00:44:45,046
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts here.

652
00:44:45,366 --> 00:44:45,766
[SPEAKER_05]: No more.

653
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:48,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob Chat is banned from Orange Lounge Radio.

654
00:44:48,447 --> 00:44:50,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't ever want to hear about this stupid idiot again.

655
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:54,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope to hell his thing gets him in trouble and whatever.

656
00:44:55,288 --> 00:44:57,949
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you see him on the street, you should kick him in the junk.

657
00:45:00,649 --> 00:45:01,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

658
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:08,051
[SPEAKER_05]: So the OLR banishment of Bob begins here and now with our favorite segment.

659
00:45:23,226 --> 00:45:25,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki would you like to start us off with the FUs of the week tonight?

660
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:38,865
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

661
00:45:57,805 --> 00:46:23,090
[SPEAKER_06]: so what you're one person that you made a game oh my god you're the first person on earth to make a game before there's a lot of people that make games by themselves you know and they put it out on the atari and shit like that that's how the whole fucking game industry worked it's how it became um just because you're one dude that makes the game doesn't mean like the nintendo has to give you a dev kit because you think you're awesome that you did what one person you know

662
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:24,457
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

663
00:46:45,576 --> 00:46:46,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Princess, your FUs.

664
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:26,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you to Lieutenant Felix Gata I don't know who the fuck you think you are but you just pissed off a whole lot of people and I hope you fucking die and that's it I feel so sorry for that actor

665
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:29,160
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm sure he's a great actor.

666
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,061
[SPEAKER_10]: He did a lot of voice work for Ranma.

667
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,242
[SPEAKER_05]: You know there's people that don't know how to tell the difference though.

668
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:34,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

669
00:47:34,222 --> 00:47:35,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not like crazy.

670
00:47:35,543 --> 00:47:37,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't like him as a character.

671
00:47:38,204 --> 00:47:40,726
[SPEAKER_10]: But I hope he fucking gets airlocked or some shit.

672
00:47:40,746 --> 00:47:44,267
[SPEAKER_05]: That must be like the first gay guy you've like really just wanted to beat up.

673
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:45,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do.

674
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:46,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

675
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:47,769
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never be his hag.

676
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:51,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be like, go fuck yourself out of an airlock.

677
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:52,271
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

678
00:47:52,732 --> 00:47:54,172
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I'm mad at him.

679
00:47:54,232 --> 00:47:54,613
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

680
00:47:56,025 --> 00:47:58,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Silent Nathan have any FUs of the week, or is he sleeping?

681
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:01,850
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's shaking his head no, a simple no.

682
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:03,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

683
00:48:05,374 --> 00:48:05,814
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

684
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:10,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, you don't see Aaron from Snake360 pulling that crap.

685
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:10,758
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

686
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so many great ways for folks together.

687
00:48:14,331 --> 00:48:15,231
[SPEAKER_06]: He's nice.

688
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:16,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm serious, though.

689
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:19,072
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy is not the only guy that's programmed a game by himself.

690
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:28,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, there's been people that have made, I think, a whole anime movie by themselves, and you don't hear them bitching and stuff, and their movie gets made and looks fucking awesome.

691
00:48:29,015 --> 00:48:35,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do want to clarify for the chat room because they were asking, even though Bob is banned from OLR, you can still say Bobby Blackwolf.

692
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:36,601
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

693
00:48:37,842 --> 00:48:39,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You can say it as part of a bigger word.

694
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:40,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

695
00:48:40,184 --> 00:48:41,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Just Bob as far as Bob's game.

696
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,309
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be a CEO or something of some company named Bob, but that's all right.

697
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:49,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And if Bobby Blackwolf makes a game, you can call it Bobby's game.

698
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:50,432
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

699
00:48:50,453 --> 00:48:53,075
[SPEAKER_06]: You can shorten it to Bob's game, but that doesn't really work.

700
00:48:53,755 --> 00:48:53,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god!

701
00:48:53,996 --> 00:48:54,617
[SPEAKER_05]: LittleBigPlanet!

702
00:49:08,243 --> 00:49:08,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

703
00:49:32,797 --> 00:49:37,638
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a rope backwards!

704
00:49:38,098 --> 00:49:44,179
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that don't know what the Snuggie is, we have to talk about this for a minute because this is important.

705
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:45,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The hell with video games.

706
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:47,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I want one of these for when I play video games.

707
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy a rope and turn it backwards!

708
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Done!

709
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:55,621
[SPEAKER_05]: The Snuggie is a blanket, but it has sleeves on it.

710
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:59,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know how sometimes your arms are just like they're under the blanket.

711
00:49:59,221 --> 00:50:01,402
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't pull them out and do things.

712
00:50:01,422 --> 00:50:02,522
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because then your arms get

713
00:50:02,642 --> 00:50:03,543
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

714
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:26,356
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

715
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:41,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?

716
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:44,531
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a fucking Snuggie that probably costs a lot of money.

717
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And they ripped off the Snuggie off of some other guy.

718
00:50:47,553 --> 00:50:48,774
[SPEAKER_06]: The Slinket.

719
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:50,135
[SPEAKER_06]: The Slinket, yeah.

720
00:50:50,636 --> 00:50:52,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then I'll buy a Slinket.

721
00:50:52,097 --> 00:50:53,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit what the name is.

722
00:50:53,498 --> 00:50:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want a blanket with sleeves.

723
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:56,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a brilliant idea.

724
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see the What the Fuck Blanket, the parody?

725
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I saw that.

726
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:01,944
[SPEAKER_10]: You posted it on your live show or whatever.

727
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:03,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's like the best thing ever.

728
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:08,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And while we're at it, CashForGold.com is a complete rip-off.

729
00:51:09,124 --> 00:51:13,965
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone can't figure that out, I mean, yeah, you send us your gold first.

730
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll tell you how much it's worth.

731
00:51:15,926 --> 00:51:18,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll wait for you and everything.

732
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:19,187
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give you a top...

733
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:20,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks!

734
00:51:20,388 --> 00:51:21,769
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give you a top dollar for it.

735
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:25,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and by the way, if you want your gold back, it's already melted down, so too bad.

736
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:27,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Tired of using regular blankets like this asshole?

737
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:29,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they somehow destroy your heating bills?

738
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:31,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you struggle when trying to figure out how to put them on?

739
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:35,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Are mundane tasks like answering the phone now impossibly difficult?

740
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, morons, now there's hope with the new What The F*** Blanket.

741
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:41,303
[SPEAKER_03]: The blanket that'll ruin your sex life.

742
00:51:41,983 --> 00:51:42,764
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on YouTube.

743
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:44,365
[SPEAKER_03]: She looks like a monk.

744
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:57,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I actually posted a reply on Rice Princess' live journal with a picture of one of the happy, happy cultists because it just reminded me because they talk about how it looks like a cult robe or whatever.

745
00:51:57,986 --> 00:52:04,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody actually replied, my parents bought one for everyone in the household.

746
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:07,468
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit is on the ground in the corner.

747
00:52:09,215 --> 00:52:10,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Where it belongs.

748
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:11,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that idea.

749
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:12,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it to me.

750
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:13,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't let it sit in the corner.

751
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:13,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

752
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:14,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, you should give it to Rob.

753
00:52:14,939 --> 00:52:16,160
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd use it, I guess.

754
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:17,241
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

755
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:20,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.

756
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:26,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the... The only thing that I don't like about the robe, though, is it conducts a lot of static electricity.

757
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:28,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, a lot of static electricity.

758
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not funny.

759
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,183
[SPEAKER_10]: and what about the ShamWow?

760
00:52:33,203 --> 00:52:34,363
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy's annoying too.

761
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:37,004
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's an actual product that's good.

762
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:38,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've never used it.

763
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:38,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

764
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:40,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to Silit Bang?

765
00:52:41,266 --> 00:52:42,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Silit Bang or the Magic Bullet.

766
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Orange Glow or something.

767
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, enough, enough.

768
00:52:45,588 --> 00:52:46,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Games, video games.

769
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:47,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Games, games, games.

770
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, Gears of War PC.

771
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:57,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently if you have it, it's not working right now because there was a little problem.

772
00:52:57,115 --> 00:53:01,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there is a Verisign code that has expired.

773
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:07,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And because it expired, the game will not work past the date January 28th.

774
00:53:07,843 --> 00:53:13,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to play it, you have to set your date back to before the 28th and then it will work just fine.

775
00:53:14,187 --> 00:53:18,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Epic is aware of the situation and is working on a way to fix it.

776
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:20,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So soon it'll be fixed.

777
00:53:20,882 --> 00:53:22,863
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now it's a minor inconvenience.

778
00:53:24,143 --> 00:53:25,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Super.

779
00:53:25,183 --> 00:53:27,983
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a pretty fucking big inconvenience, actually.

780
00:53:28,023 --> 00:53:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you just got this game in the bargain bin at a store or something?

781
00:53:31,664 --> 00:53:34,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you would go online, read about it, and set your date back to before the 20th.

782
00:53:34,905 --> 00:53:36,465
[SPEAKER_06]: What if I'm not smart enough to do that?

783
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:38,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then, too bad.

784
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:43,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you go back and take it back to Walmart and go, this game no work, and then they'll give you your money back.

785
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give me a Snuggie instead?

786
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:48,227
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, I'm going to go take back my copies of Gears of War PC and get a Snuggie.

787
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:51,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Gears of War Snuggie

788
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:16,352
[SPEAKER_05]: But with sleeves, Loki, you're missing the point It needs sleeves I have an idea Why don't you get pajamas?

789
00:54:17,893 --> 00:54:25,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a jacket Or a robe Pajamas make me feel old Or like some socks What are you saying about pajamas, okay?

790
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a pair of flannel pajamas that are fucking comfortable, okay?

791
00:54:29,137 --> 00:54:30,878
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're warm And they're warm

792
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:39,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look, Gears of War didn't just make the mistake of not making a Snuggie out of their collection or flubbing the PC version of the game.

793
00:54:40,273 --> 00:54:48,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, also, the Gears of War 2 Gold Lancer went up on Xbox Live for everybody earlier this week.

794
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:52,136
[SPEAKER_05]: This was something you were only supposed to get if you actually got the collector's edition of Gears of War 2.

795
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:54,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I say Gold Lancer, I don't mean a car.

796
00:54:55,357 --> 00:54:56,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the type of gun.

797
00:54:56,337 --> 00:54:57,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the type of gun that you use in the game.

798
00:54:57,898 --> 00:54:58,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom!

799
00:54:59,578 --> 00:55:03,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that would be pretty awesome if you suddenly could use cars to run over the monsters.

800
00:55:04,941 --> 00:55:06,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the other interesting thing about it.

801
00:55:06,502 --> 00:55:17,207
[SPEAKER_05]: According to a representative for Xbox Live, everybody who actually got the Gold Lancer during the period that it was available, they're going to have the item removed from the game in an upcoming fix.

802
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:17,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

803
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:23,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like they said the Fable 2 exclusive code or whatever for people to have the collector's edition.

804
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,712
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to find out who doesn't have the collector's edition.

805
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:28,293
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take it away from you.

806
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:29,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that never happened.

807
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:37,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, also, the way they fixed this temporarily, they put the Gold Lancer... I mean, they weren't able to remove the Gold Lancer from Xbox Live Marketplace.

808
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:45,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, it was still there late last week, but it was being charged a price of 99,999 Microsoft points.

809
00:55:45,266 --> 00:55:46,287
[SPEAKER_05]: They do that.

810
00:55:46,447 --> 00:55:50,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like that before, because they actually have that available, and then there's also some map

811
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

812
00:56:17,274 --> 00:56:20,875
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be able to download it onto your system or something like that.

813
00:56:20,935 --> 00:56:22,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that would be exclusive.

814
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:26,276
[SPEAKER_06]: They did this originally with... There was also the Banjo-Kazooie thing.

815
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,457
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox Live Arcade game that was available only for a limited time.

816
00:56:29,817 --> 00:56:34,678
[SPEAKER_06]: However, they caught that too and they also put it like $9.99 as the amount for it.

817
00:56:34,718 --> 00:56:39,159
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to wonder if anybody spends the $150,000 or whatever it would take to get it anyway.

818
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:45,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there are people that buy stupid iPhone programs that cost thousands of dollars just to have a stupid gem on there.

819
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

820
00:56:47,455 --> 00:56:49,657
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

821
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, objects in there.

822
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:12,448
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a little slime object that's kind of angry-looking and a cross that looks angry.

823
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:13,949
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a whole lot of angry stuff.

824
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:18,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's like in Super Mario Bros., how everything has a smiley face on it.

825
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:22,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything has an angry face in this game, so that's interesting.

826
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other games, of course, that are going to be coming as well.

827
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:28,955
[SPEAKER_06]: The Crystal Defenders, which of course was originally a mobile game.

828
00:57:29,735 --> 00:57:30,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other stuff...

829
00:57:32,602 --> 00:57:33,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

830
00:57:53,746 --> 00:57:58,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wonder if they're still making money on that, you know what I mean?

831
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, I doubt it.

832
00:57:59,671 --> 00:58:03,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's kind of free money at this point if they do have anybody playing it.

833
00:58:03,394 --> 00:58:09,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm sure it takes like one server to run the whole thing, but, you know, they could release that as like a $10 Xbox Live arcade game.

834
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,742
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't even have to charge a monthly fee, and they'd still make a pretty penny off it.

835
00:58:12,902 --> 00:58:15,704
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a game, and I can't remember what the hell it was called.

836
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:20,868
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, and I'm not even sure if it actually came out, but it was for, I think, the PlayStation 2.

837
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:22,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Might have been the PlayStation 1.

838
00:58:23,946 --> 00:58:52,323
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was on a demo disc that was I think it was a Playstation 1 now if I remember correctly it was on a demo disc with like I want to say maybe it would have been Final Fantasy 7 there might have been some other stuff on there as well and it was a street racing RPG but I don't remember what it was called though but I remember it had racing in it and it was from Square Enix but that would be another cool game to bring out

839
00:58:54,022 --> 00:58:54,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

840
00:58:54,622 --> 00:58:54,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

841
00:58:55,883 --> 00:59:00,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure there'll be some type of Final Fantasy milking at some point, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

842
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they do have Crystal Defenders, which is a Final Fantasy game, so... Alright, I guess there is that.

843
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:13,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, if you are downloading a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Marketplace for popular role-playing games, perhaps you've checked out some of the content for Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

844
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:19,233
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bethesda actually put out a list this week of what some of the top downloaded Oblivion content is.

845
00:59:19,813 --> 00:59:26,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And funny enough, the top downloaded content is Wizards Tower is the number one most downloaded content that they have.

846
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:30,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Knights of the Nine is all the way down to number seven.

847
00:59:30,341 --> 00:59:31,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Shivering Isles, number eight.

848
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:35,265
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's interesting, I mean, because those are pretty expensive if I remember right.

849
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:39,828
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's interesting, remember all the shit that Bethesda used to get for the horse armor?

850
00:59:40,448 --> 00:59:42,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the horse armor download they put?

851
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently that content's all it was.

852
00:59:45,493 --> 00:59:50,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas all this other content I'm mentioning is new levels, new areas to explore, new quests and stuff.

853
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:53,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Horse armor was just armor for your horse.

854
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:55,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was just a visual thing only.

855
00:59:55,662 --> 00:59:56,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It did nothing special.

856
00:59:57,063 --> 01:00:00,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And they actually charged a lot of money for this.

857
01:00:00,506 --> 01:00:02,628
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time, it was an insane amount.

858
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:03,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

859
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:03,929
[SPEAKER_05]: How much was horse armor?

860
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:05,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like five bucks, I think.

861
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:07,271
[SPEAKER_05]: for stupid armor for your horse.

862
01:00:07,832 --> 01:00:10,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is, that checks in at number nine.

863
01:00:11,753 --> 01:00:14,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And they claim they still sell some horse armor every day.

864
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:16,594
Wow.

865
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:18,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, even after all this time.

866
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Fighter Stronghold is the dead last entry.

867
01:00:22,336 --> 01:00:23,537
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to hear something off the top ten list?

868
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:28,018
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get Elder Scrolls Oblivion, the Game of the Year edition with the expansion on it.

869
01:00:29,078 --> 01:00:29,439
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 bucks.

870
01:00:30,219 --> 01:00:30,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad.

871
01:00:31,618 --> 01:00:32,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking about buying it again.

872
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:33,959
[SPEAKER_06]: For PlayStation 3?

873
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

874
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't catch which system it was on.

875
01:00:39,362 --> 01:00:40,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Game of the Year edition is on both.

876
01:00:41,523 --> 01:00:42,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of them are $20 now.

877
01:00:43,188 --> 01:00:44,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Fighter Stronghold is dead last.

878
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:50,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, though, that could be because this thing only ranks the bot download and pay for it.

879
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And Fighter Stronghold was free for a little while.

880
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:52,530
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I have it.

881
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So probably a lot of people grabbed it when it was free and they never needed to get it again.

882
01:00:56,671 --> 01:01:03,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an Xbox Magazine disc that actually has two of those on there that were paid download content for free.

883
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:05,439
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want them.

884
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you still play Oblivion, but you know.

885
01:01:07,841 --> 01:01:09,784
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so much to do in Oblivion.

886
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:12,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, God, even without the expansions, I felt like they can't.

887
01:01:12,226 --> 01:01:17,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, literally, you can just walk around the world and just walk into random ass dungeons and explore them.

888
01:01:17,993 --> 01:01:19,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was just so much in that game.

889
01:01:20,396 --> 01:01:20,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

890
01:01:20,896 --> 01:01:21,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait for the next one.

891
01:01:22,618 --> 01:01:24,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

892
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:47,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Raiden Fighter Aces, I believe, came out in Japan, and it's rumored to be coming out over here as well.

893
01:01:47,576 --> 01:01:52,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Raiden Fighter Aces actually is a collection of three different Raiden Fighter games.

894
01:01:52,818 --> 01:01:59,200
[SPEAKER_06]: They have Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighters Jet, all on one disc.

895
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:05,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the rumors are that Zoo Games is actually publishing the game in the U.S.

896
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:06,443
[SPEAKER_06]: for $29.99.

897
01:02:08,783 --> 01:02:10,744
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

898
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:37,821
[SPEAKER_06]: No, these are coming out in the US.

899
01:02:38,081 --> 01:02:38,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And what platform?

900
01:02:39,262 --> 01:02:40,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox 360.

901
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:40,603
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

902
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:45,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, Raiden 4 will be coming out at the end of March.

903
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:46,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

904
01:02:47,788 --> 01:02:50,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there will be a lot of people that are very interested in that.

905
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:54,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Also some folks interested in everything Banjo-Kazooie related.

906
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:55,434
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Banjo-Tooie.

907
01:02:55,954 --> 01:03:00,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Banjo-Tooie is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade apparently a little later this year.

908
01:03:01,398 --> 01:03:05,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably about 1,200 Microsoft points, although that hasn't been confirmed yet.

909
01:03:06,403 --> 01:03:07,924
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is confirmed.

910
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:08,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It is coming out.

911
01:03:09,446 --> 01:03:12,709
[SPEAKER_05]: It's slightly upped graphics and upped frame rate as well.

912
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,032
[SPEAKER_05]: And Stop and Swap is coming over.

913
01:03:16,352 --> 01:03:24,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this is something from the Nintendo 64 days where if you got some items in Banjo-Kazooie, they will show up in Banjo-Tooie as well.

914
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:24,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

915
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too big of a surprise since I'm assuming the first one did pretty well for them and the game was already done.

916
01:03:29,762 --> 01:03:34,925
[SPEAKER_05]: They just have to do some upgrades and sell it all over again for $15 and people will buy it.

917
01:03:35,085 --> 01:03:37,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Where there's horse armor, there's Banjo-Tooie.

918
01:03:40,848 --> 01:03:50,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but you know, there's a lot of people who love the Banjo series and I'm sure excited to play it all over again with the updated graphics and widescreen and all that stuff, so good for them.

919
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:56,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, if you're not waiting for Banjo-Tooie, there are some other things coming out this week.

920
01:03:57,053 --> 01:03:59,654
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be something you want to pick up.

921
01:03:59,854 --> 01:04:02,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, not a whole lot this week, unfortunately.

922
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:05,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting things off, let's see.

923
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:11,900
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, for the Wii, Rygar Battle of Argus.

924
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:13,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

925
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:13,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

926
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:27,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's a port of the Playstation 2 game and then they've added like some Colosseum levels or something like that so yay, a port of something that came out like what five years ago?

927
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:41,712
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, it was a while ago so that'll be coming out and then this week I know there's some miscellaneous DS games like some Imagine crap um

928
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:47,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine crapping.

929
01:04:47,252 --> 01:04:51,494
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really pathetic, the lineup this week, I swear.

930
01:04:52,695 --> 01:04:55,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Could that be because we have Street Fighter 4 coming out the week after?

931
01:04:55,376 --> 01:04:56,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that two weeks?

932
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:56,856
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two weeks.

933
01:04:57,697 --> 01:04:58,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Two weeks.

934
01:04:58,337 --> 01:05:00,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the week after would be Fear 2.

935
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:03,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's people definitely excited about that.

936
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.

937
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2 is next week in Japan.

938
01:05:07,601 --> 01:05:08,542
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll get to that in a minute.

939
01:05:10,596 --> 01:05:12,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you done with the US dates?

940
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,801
[SPEAKER_06]: This list I'm looking at is not very accurate.

941
01:05:16,881 --> 01:05:18,262
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually doesn't even have next week.

942
01:05:18,802 --> 01:05:20,063
[SPEAKER_06]: It just skips over next week.

943
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,484
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how pathetic next week is.

944
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:31,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think if there's... I think Tenchu Z... Tenchu 4 on the Wii is coming out, I believe, as well.

945
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember if that got delayed or not.

946
01:05:56,442 --> 01:05:59,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, Capcom typically releases stuff in the first quarter.

947
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:05,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, this year they're releasing stuff first quarter and second quarter, which is good.

948
01:06:05,406 --> 01:06:09,547
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are pretty smart to do so because there's not much competition this time of year.

949
01:06:09,788 --> 01:06:11,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Although this year there's pretty good stuff coming out.

950
01:06:12,509 --> 01:06:14,189
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, not too much.

951
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,690
[SPEAKER_06]: This next week is really dead.

952
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:23,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll wait for the week after that where we actually get into the meat of things and it'll start picking up from there all the way through March.

953
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's talk about Japanese release dates.

954
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:28,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Luckily it looks a little better over there for the Japanese release dates.

955
01:06:28,962 --> 01:06:32,363
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Xbox 360, Burnout Paradise, the ultimate box set, makes its way.

956
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:35,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm assuming that's just all the special download stuff we got here.

957
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:42,668
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Burnout plus the ultimate party thing that they've got that's going to be a download next week.

958
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically all the extra crap.

959
01:06:44,248 --> 01:06:47,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get that in Japan this week on February the 5th for the Xbox 360.

960
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Midnight Club Los Angeles comes out on the 5th.

961
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:55,135
[SPEAKER_05]: If you head over to the PlayStation, it's racing fun on the Xbox 360 this week.

962
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:59,759
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Street Fighter 4 is next week, but I'll remind you about that next week.

963
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:05,343
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PlayStation 3, Burnout Paradise, The Ultimate Box, also there, as well as Midnight Club Los Angeles.

964
01:07:05,363 --> 01:07:11,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You also get Shaun White Snowboarding, and Demon's Souls is a game that's coming out from Sony on the PlayStation 3.

965
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,231
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you laughing at over there?

966
01:07:14,742 --> 01:07:17,063
[SPEAKER_10]: and Demon's Souls.

967
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It's apparently a pretty big release.

968
01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:20,965
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an RPG coming out.

969
01:07:21,546 --> 01:07:24,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Demon's Souls!

970
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:25,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

971
01:07:27,472 --> 01:07:29,774
[SPEAKER_05]: For that, I'm not going to tell you anything more about Demon's Souls.

972
01:07:29,914 --> 01:07:32,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It will forever be a mystery.

973
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:34,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an RPG made by Sony.

974
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:41,987
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Nintendo Wii, another code are Kyoku no Tobira is coming out from Nintendo.

975
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,169
[SPEAKER_05]: D-Terminal and AV Cable.

976
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:44,829
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

977
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:47,752
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need a new AV Cable, you can get that this week.

978
01:07:48,173 --> 01:07:49,254
[SPEAKER_05]: D-Terminal is pretty cool.

979
01:07:52,216 --> 01:07:58,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the D-terminal is cool because, I mean, you know, if you want to hook it up to a PC monitor, that's the only way you can do it, really.

980
01:07:59,182 --> 01:08:02,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to say, though, this Another Code R game actually sounds kind of cool.

981
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:04,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this just Lost in Blue?

982
01:08:04,826 --> 01:08:05,847
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is Trace Memory.

983
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Trace Memory.

984
01:08:07,328 --> 01:08:09,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, because I got confused when I looked at the thing.

985
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,412
[SPEAKER_05]: This game actually sounds kind of cool.

986
01:08:12,012 --> 01:08:14,894
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's weird is I thought that game has been out for a while.

987
01:08:14,914 --> 01:08:15,715
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just coming out again.

988
01:08:15,735 --> 01:08:18,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I've seen it floating around for a while, but, you know, I could be wrong.

989
01:08:19,578 --> 01:08:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm even thinking of the DS version.

990
01:08:20,919 --> 01:08:21,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you are.

991
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:21,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you are.

992
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2, nothing.

993
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:28,165
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one game getting a price reduction, Momotaro Densetsu 16.

994
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:30,606
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, and nothing else is new.

995
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo DS is a little different.

996
01:08:32,628 --> 01:08:43,876
[SPEAKER_05]: There is some new stuff coming out, but it's mostly like covers and pouches and things like that, but there is a game called Destiny Links coming out from Bandai Namco, and it's an RPG, of course, and...

997
01:08:45,307 --> 01:08:49,580
[SPEAKER_05]: You get your character and you sail forth to Amazia, the island of happiness.

998
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that sounds like a destiny I want.

999
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,071
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Max Fever DJ Max Fever

1000
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, let's go to Europe real quick.

1001
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:24,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll go ahead and read the Europe dates for you.

1002
01:09:24,623 --> 01:09:27,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Japan and the U.S.

1003
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:30,425
[SPEAKER_05]: were kind of slow, but Europe has a big week ahead.

1004
01:09:30,505 --> 01:09:35,488
[SPEAKER_05]: For February 6th, they're getting Burnout Paradise on the PC, Castlevania Order of Ecclesia on the DS,

1005
01:09:35,728 --> 01:09:39,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Chrono Trigger finally hits on the DS for those folks in Europe.

1006
01:09:39,611 --> 01:09:40,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Gauntlet on the DS.

1012
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:55,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking tongue twister.

[SPEAKER_05]: Shellshock 2 Blood Trails comes out on 360, PS3, and PC.

1014
01:10:00,846 --> 01:10:02,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And Walk With Me.

1015
01:10:02,187 --> 01:10:04,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know your walking routine on the DS?

1016
01:10:04,349 --> 01:10:06,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know that you're walking right now?

1017
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:10,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it funny that even when we get the crap games, so do Europe.

1018
01:10:10,894 --> 01:10:14,477
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we get a great game like Chrono Trigger, they have to wait like three months for it.

1019
01:10:14,517 --> 01:10:15,217
[SPEAKER_05]: You poor guys.

1020
01:10:15,237 --> 01:10:16,058
[SPEAKER_05]: We got Pikmin.

1021
01:10:17,299 --> 01:10:23,124
[SPEAKER_06]: See, they're going to get the port of Pikmin now, and we're going to get the new Zelda months before they will.

1022
01:10:24,232 --> 01:10:25,313
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair.

1023
01:10:25,974 --> 01:10:28,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Go Nintendo.

1024
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:29,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy oh boy.

1025
01:10:29,778 --> 01:10:34,403
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what else is equally awesome as delays and stuff like that?

1026
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:40,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band receiving some brand new tracks from Nickelodeon's

1027
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:45,492
[SPEAKER_06]: HighSchoolMusical-esque movie Spectacular.

1028
01:10:47,214 --> 01:10:51,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there's two songs from the film, Break My Heart and Don't Tell Me.

1029
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:59,228
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be both available for the equivalent of $1 on your Xbox Live Marketplace or PlayStation Network.

1030
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:15,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, if you happen to wait until March 31st for the DVD release of Spectacular, there will also be a redemption code for a free download of the two songs via the Rock Band Music Store.

1031
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:17,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're curious what this sounds like...

1032
01:11:33,349 --> 01:11:35,011
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1033
01:11:51,135 --> 01:11:52,236
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1034
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:07,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1035
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:35,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya pours bleach on his speakers.

1036
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Leo Shen, my ears are bleeding now, damn it.

1037
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,380
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fine.

1038
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:43,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there's not a lot of people that are going to be downloading the spectacular songs.

1039
01:12:43,821 --> 01:12:44,962
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's spectacular.

1040
01:12:44,982 --> 01:12:46,082
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's spectacular.

1041
01:12:47,022 --> 01:12:51,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Also spectacular is a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1042
01:12:51,543 --> 01:12:54,663
[SPEAKER_05]: We like to pay a little respect to the classic games.

1043
01:12:55,023 --> 01:12:58,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a little segment we do here on the show called the classic game of the week.

1044
01:13:01,297 --> 01:13:01,899
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1045
01:13:07,253 --> 01:13:20,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I decided to pick one for us, but you know, I kind of picked one collectively for all of us to kind of match, you know, there is a certain something going on right now in the world, you know, there's that big game, I guess they throw a ball around and all this stuff.

1046
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:32,178
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, of course, we are taping the same day as the Super Bowl, and when you talk football and you talk video games, there really is one classic video game you have to recognize, and that is this week's classic game of the week.

1047
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:33,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Blades of Steel.

1048
01:13:33,338 --> 01:13:33,458
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1049
01:13:34,537 --> 01:13:37,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Tecmo Bowl is this week's classic game of the week.

1050
01:13:43,543 --> 01:13:47,106
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, the wonderful 8-bit sounds of Tecmo Bowl on the NES.

1051
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:50,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I chose purposefully not to do Tecmo Super Bowl tonight.

1052
01:13:50,809 --> 01:13:54,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I did Tecmo Bowl, the old school one, because this is a little more of a classic.

1053
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:58,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I played this game a hell of a lot growing up.

1054
01:13:58,634 --> 01:13:58,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I know...

1055
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:03,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We like to think that Rob plays like no sports games and hates them all, but there are a few.

1056
01:14:04,397 --> 01:14:07,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Few and far between that will come along once in a while to get my attention, and Tecmo Bowl was one of them.

1057
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:10,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's learn a little bit about Tecmo Bowl.

1058
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Tecmo Bowl was actually based off an arcade game, an arcade version of Tecmo Bowl.

1059
01:14:14,342 --> 01:14:25,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I should be noted, that's not what we're citing as the classic game of the week, because I've played the arcade version in a compilation that was on the Xbox, Tecmo Classic Arcade, and it stinks compared to the one on the NES.

1060
01:14:25,247 --> 01:14:27,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem to move as quickly, I just don't care for it.

1061
01:14:28,509 --> 01:14:28,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um...

1062
01:14:30,131 --> 01:14:32,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Tecmo Ball on the NES is our classic game of the week.

1063
01:14:32,753 --> 01:14:33,773
[SPEAKER_05]: You've probably seen this before.

1064
01:14:33,813 --> 01:14:36,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 12, 2007.

1065
01:14:37,616 --> 01:14:42,879
[SPEAKER_05]: But the original came out in 1989 after the original arcade version was released in 1987.

1066
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:49,263
[SPEAKER_05]: The arcade version had this big two-monitor setup so that four people could play.

1067
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:52,585
[SPEAKER_05]: But the NES version was way scaled down because it was only two players.

1068
01:14:53,226 --> 01:14:57,428
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do three modes, one player, two player, or just a coach mode where you would pick all the plays.

1069
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:05,150
[SPEAKER_05]: The playbook only has four offensive plays, or if you're on defense, you kind of try to pick the play that you think the offense is going to pick.

1070
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,331
[SPEAKER_05]: And you did it with this combination of the controller and the buttons.

1071
01:15:09,531 --> 01:15:11,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Tecmo Bowl isn't a perfect game, though.

1072
01:15:11,211 --> 01:15:15,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a little better than 10-yard fight, which was one of the only other football games that was out at the time.

1073
01:15:16,252 --> 01:15:20,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, almost any pass that you throw to a covered receiver is going to end up in interception.

1074
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:27,354
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use the New York Giants and you use Lawrence Taylor, apparently you can pretty much block almost all kicks.

1075
01:15:28,254 --> 01:15:51,124
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently San Francisco has a play that is usually unstoppable against almost any defense and I used to win every time with San Francisco and I think that's probably why by the way you wouldn't actually be playing as the New York Giants though in the game because they didn't have the licensing from the NFL to actually use the names of the teams so when you selected teams you were just Indianapolis or San Francisco or New York

1076
01:15:51,744 --> 01:15:52,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1077
01:16:07,694 --> 01:16:16,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know enough about football to understand the whole thing behind that, but you do get the players, and they are all in the game, and, you know, it was the old 8-bit NES days.

1078
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,641
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't really look any different.

1079
01:16:17,701 --> 01:16:19,042
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that you had the different names.

1080
01:16:19,402 --> 01:16:30,530
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you downloaded this on the Virtual Console version, you didn't get the names because the licensing had expired, so they actually removed all the names from the version that came out for Virtual Console, which kind of stinks.

1081
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:53,820
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way, there was also a version on mobile phones that was released in 2004 and apparently they are bringing this series back Tecmo Bowl Kickoff I don't know if this came out yet, but that was supposed to be coming out on the DS I don't know if that ever did actually come out or is still on its way out I can't remember if it came out in November or not it was originally going to come out in November

1082
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:56,456
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1083
01:16:56,596 --> 01:16:59,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It just isn't the old school 8-bit version.

1084
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:09,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's a lot of people very partial to Tecmo Super Bowl, but I have to take a minute to just recognize the greatness of the classic NES version.

1085
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:10,659
[SPEAKER_05]: You're actually nodding your head, Rice Princess.

1086
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:11,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it did come out.

1087
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:12,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it did come out?

1088
01:17:12,579 --> 01:17:13,120
[SPEAKER_06]: When did it come out?

1089
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too long ago, but it's available for $20.

1090
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it just price dropped.

1091
01:17:18,281 --> 01:17:20,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Princess, were you a fan of Tecmo Bowl?

1092
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:20,521
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1093
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:21,001
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

1094
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:21,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1095
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:23,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Were there any sports games that you played?

1096
01:17:24,762 --> 01:17:24,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1097
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:37,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this about Tecmo Bo2 is that it had like little cinematics when you got a touchdown it was like high five in super slow motion because we don't really have movies and this halftime show

1098
01:17:38,507 --> 01:17:39,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, a halftime show.

1099
01:17:39,768 --> 01:17:40,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, a cinematic halftime show.

1100
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:41,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty awesome.

1101
01:17:41,349 --> 01:17:43,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like Ninja Gaiden, but with football.

1102
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:43,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Ninja Gaiden.

1103
01:17:44,332 --> 01:17:55,380
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I was nodding my head because I'm concurring with your point about paying homage to the older, original versions and stuff like that.

1104
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:03,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, if I were to pick an NFL game that was going to be my pick for something like this today, NFL Blitz.

1105
01:18:03,966 --> 01:18:04,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew it.

1106
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:06,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fair enough.

1107
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:07,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody likes that game.

1108
01:18:07,348 --> 01:18:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe next year.

1109
01:18:08,088 --> 01:18:09,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe during next Super Bowl.

1110
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1111
01:18:10,249 --> 01:18:10,989
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's it for now.

1112
01:18:11,009 --> 01:18:14,370
[SPEAKER_05]: It's your classic game of the week, Tecmo Bowl, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1113
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:23,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, it's going to bring Part A of our show to a close tonight, but don't go anywhere, because we're going to be just right back in a few seconds with Part B. If you're listening on the podcast, it only takes a few seconds.

1114
01:18:23,952 --> 01:18:32,253
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear that little do-do-do-do, and then it's right back into Part B. But if you're listening live, this is the point where we take a little bit longer of a break to, you know, get a drink of water, use the restroom.

1115
01:18:32,553 --> 01:18:33,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Toilet bowl.

1116
01:18:33,814 --> 01:18:33,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Or...

1117
01:18:36,154 --> 01:18:37,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the Toilet Super Bowl.

1118
01:18:37,835 --> 01:18:45,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And this will actually be, it's very special this week, our break, because this will be try to restrain Rice Princess from my Xbox 360 for 10 minutes during the break.

1119
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:48,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how that works.

1120
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1121
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:03,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 1st of 2009.

1122
01:19:04,242 --> 01:19:07,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a big football game going on today, but we're here doing a show anyway.

1123
01:19:08,104 --> 01:19:08,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It's over, actually.

1124
01:19:08,904 --> 01:19:09,645
[SPEAKER_05]: The Steelers won.

1125
01:19:09,805 --> 01:19:11,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, it was really exciting.

1126
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:15,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there was like a big run to a touchdown or things like that.

1127
01:19:16,008 --> 01:19:17,289
[SPEAKER_05]: You can totally tell I don't know dick about football.

1128
01:19:17,309 --> 01:19:19,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that thing that happens when you play football?

1129
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:20,811
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is not here tonight.

1130
01:19:41,656 --> 01:19:42,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1131
01:19:58,857 --> 01:19:59,818
[SPEAKER_05]: or at least attempts to do.

1132
01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:03,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And Silent Nathan is also here, but he wouldn't know because he doesn't say much.

1133
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,602
[SPEAKER_05]: But he is here wearing his Horde hat, showing his pride for the Horde.

1134
01:20:06,622 --> 01:20:07,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm wearing my Alliance sweater.

1135
01:20:08,163 --> 01:20:09,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, do you two like fight for real?

1136
01:20:09,644 --> 01:20:11,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I punch him in the face all the time.

1137
01:20:11,585 --> 01:20:11,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1138
01:20:12,185 --> 01:20:18,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, too bad we don't have a webcam, but we will have it next week because there's a cord coming from New Jersey, I found out.

1139
01:20:18,509 --> 01:20:18,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

1140
01:20:19,474 --> 01:20:19,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo.

1141
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:22,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

1142
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:24,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's here to deliver the news as always.

1143
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:25,379
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, Loki?

1144
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:26,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much.

1145
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:30,903
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be some new download content coming out for the new Prince of Persia game.

1146
01:20:31,864 --> 01:20:34,386
[SPEAKER_06]: This takes place after the end of the game.

1147
01:20:34,426 --> 01:20:36,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the epilogue download content.

1148
01:20:37,148 --> 01:20:46,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will kind of further develop the relationship between the two main characters and also have them going after a new enemy, the Shapeshifter.

1149
01:20:46,476 --> 01:20:47,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to do it yet?

1150
01:20:48,413 --> 01:20:49,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

1151
01:20:50,655 --> 01:20:57,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently the Shapeshifter is an enemy that takes the form of the two of Ahriman's most fearsome lieutenants, the Warrior and the Hunter.

1152
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:10,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's as though their physical form is familiar to our heroes, and the player will require particular strategies to defeat the Shapeshifter, rewarding the player that takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the epilogue.

1153
01:21:11,192 --> 01:21:14,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I get to have more conversations with the chick that always saves me from falling to my death?

1154
01:21:15,536 --> 01:21:16,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly.

1155
01:21:16,317 --> 01:21:16,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1156
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:30,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, you know, they're going to have the sprinting offensive and Elika is going to get the new energized power which will allow her to temporarily restore a piece of destroyed environment.

1157
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:31,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1158
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:33,119
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be interesting.

1159
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:37,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the game still help me every step of the way by telling me what buttons to push?

1160
01:21:38,228 --> 01:21:38,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1161
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:39,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1162
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:41,834
[SPEAKER_06]: The download content will be available though on February 26th.

1163
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, check that out.

1164
01:21:44,501 --> 01:21:45,701
[SPEAKER_05]: How much do they have priced for that?

1165
01:21:45,881 --> 01:21:46,702
[SPEAKER_06]: No price yet.

1166
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:51,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhere between $5 and $10, I'm guessing.

1167
01:21:51,284 --> 01:21:57,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, something that does have a price, a pretty high price, 8,190 yen they are going to charge for this.

1168
01:21:57,926 --> 01:22:03,389
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $90 American dollars they are charging for The Last Remnant on PC.

1169
01:22:03,929 --> 01:22:05,610
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is according to Famitsu Magazine.

1170
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,571
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a PC port of The Last Remnant.

1171
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:08,031
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a

1172
01:22:08,451 --> 01:22:36,709
[SPEAKER_05]: A roleplaying game that was put out on the Xbox 360 They hit kind of mixed reviews Some of our listeners have been saying pretty favorable things about this I haven't checked this game out myself yet But if you don't own an Xbox 360 and you want to check this out on PC You might be in luck because it is coming in Japan on April 9th But it is going to have that pretty high price tag And then when you count importing fees on top of that or what have you Although of course I'm sure if you wanted to go to darker places on the internet You could probably get it for free But I don't know, it's going to be all in Japanese, so who knows Anyway

1173
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:42,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, though, it's going to actually give you some extra stuff in the PC version.

1174
01:22:42,199 --> 01:22:44,260
[SPEAKER_05]: You can speed up battle animations now.

1175
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It will have more leader class characters.

1176
01:22:47,901 --> 01:22:52,403
[SPEAKER_05]: You can preview equipment in the menu, and you can actually switch between Japanese and English.

1177
01:22:52,483 --> 01:22:56,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you won't need to patch much more than the menus to get this.

1178
01:22:56,344 --> 01:22:58,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ranma is in chat and says it's a great game.

1179
01:22:58,365 --> 01:22:59,705
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Last Remnant, great game.

1180
01:23:00,326 --> 01:23:02,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Comment coming from our chat room, chat.orangemonstrady.com.

1181
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:04,587
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're just joining us post-Super Bowl, you should come join us.

1182
01:23:04,707 --> 01:23:08,750
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it's easier to install and have run than Grand Theft Auto 4.

1183
01:23:10,131 --> 01:23:12,212
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, one other quick thing I want to say about this game.

1184
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:16,235
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the game that Square Enix took the Unreal Engine for.

1185
01:23:16,255 --> 01:23:21,159
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember a few years back, there was a big news story that Square Enix had purchased the Unreal Engine for something.

1186
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:21,899
[SPEAKER_05]: This is that game.

1187
01:23:22,259 --> 01:23:24,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see it in motion on the PC.

1188
01:23:25,742 --> 01:23:26,522
[SPEAKER_05]: In The Last Remnant.

1189
01:23:26,803 --> 01:23:29,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And apparently it was un-really disappointing.

1190
01:23:29,264 --> 01:23:29,945
Yeah.

1191
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:34,773
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a mixed bag of opinions.

1192
01:23:36,034 --> 01:23:42,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, something that might be a little bit better, hopefully, are some sequels to some well-known Capcom franchises.

1193
01:23:43,902 --> 01:23:51,369
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some talk about a brand new Dead Rising game and a Lost Planet game, and that they may possibly be...

1194
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:54,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1195
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:15,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big surprise since Capcom, Dead Rising did very well for them and they're making a Lost Planet movie for God's sake.

1196
01:24:16,957 --> 01:24:22,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big surprise that we'll see some new games and the fact that they'll be multi-platform is not a shock either.

1197
01:24:23,922 --> 01:24:24,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1198
01:24:25,123 --> 01:24:26,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully those are soon.

1199
01:24:26,204 --> 01:24:27,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll see those at E3.

1200
01:24:28,881 --> 01:24:35,684
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting to think about what kinds of stuff we're really going to see come out of E3 this year because it's been fairly quiet, all things considered.

1201
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:43,567
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking this year's E3 is going to be pretty big, especially the whole return to E3's roots, even though they say not really, but that whole thing.

1202
01:24:44,468 --> 01:24:44,868
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1203
01:24:45,848 --> 01:24:52,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, but Capcom's all about the multi-porting too, so I'm sure if these things are coming out, they're going to be everywhere on every platform, right?

1204
01:24:53,852 --> 01:24:54,192
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1205
01:24:55,814 --> 01:25:00,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams is going to finally add something that was missing from the first Bioshock.

1206
01:25:00,376 --> 01:25:03,137
[SPEAKER_05]: What was missing from the first Bioshock for being a first-person shooter?

1207
01:25:18,584 --> 01:25:19,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer!

1208
01:25:19,805 --> 01:25:20,225
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1209
01:25:20,605 --> 01:25:24,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently this is all according to some recent job listings that were discovered.

1210
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:27,468
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bioshock team is looking for some multiplayer gameplay experts.

1211
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:35,752
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking for some people who know how to extend and enhance the Unreal Engine 3 with proprietary networking technology to address gameplay performance and so on.

1212
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:46,963
[SPEAKER_05]: as somebody who can deliver a robust, scalable, and responsive multiplayer gameplay code and backend services for the PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 platforms.

1213
01:25:47,283 --> 01:25:53,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless there's some top secret unannounced project going on here, you can almost count on the fact that Bioshock 2 is going to have

1214
01:25:54,370 --> 01:26:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: multiplayer in it which is something the first one was pretty lacking although honestly I mean it didn't need it Bioshock was a hell of a first-person shooter game um you know that even people that don't play a lot of first-person shooters like me can get into because it was almost like Silent Hill-ish in how scary it was at least for me kind of the psychological element of the game so it's gonna be interesting to see what a multiplayer does to all that

1215
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:25,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that gets me thinking, since I invoked Silent Hill in that last story, why did we never get a multiplayer Silent Hill?

1216
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:26,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't that be kind of interesting?

1217
01:26:27,231 --> 01:26:28,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because they tried.

1218
01:26:28,732 --> 01:26:29,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it would work out.

1219
01:26:30,513 --> 01:26:35,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it wouldn't, because Silent Hill, a lot of times, is somebody's personal interpretation.

1220
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:35,896
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1221
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:39,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's usually a very personalized story, so I don't think anything like that would really work.

1222
01:26:39,739 --> 01:26:40,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's fun to think about.

1223
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Not really.

1224
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:42,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

1225
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:50,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be getting some brand new download packs in February.

1226
01:26:51,796 --> 01:26:57,199
[SPEAKER_06]: The first pack is going to be the Acoustic Track Pack, which is available for 440 Microsoft Points.

1227
01:26:59,824 --> 01:27:02,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Included with that will be the Songholic.

1228
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:03,566
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me angry.

1229
01:27:05,947 --> 01:27:22,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Acoustic Track Pack, which will be available for 440 Microsoft Points or $5.49, will include three different songs, including Drive by Incubus, New Slang by The Shins, and Wonderwall, the Oasis cover by Ryan Adams.

1230
01:27:24,217 --> 01:27:27,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are each also available for 160 Microsoft Points or $2 each.

1231
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:28,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1232
01:27:29,614 --> 01:27:50,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan Adams covered Wonderwall like wow that's gonna be bad I'm sorry I saw Ryan Adams once in concert and he was kind of a douche so I mean he's a douchey guy covering a douchey song from a douchey band I mean this is just like oh it's gonna be terrible

1233
01:27:52,779 --> 01:27:55,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Wings Track Pack Wings Track Pack Wings Track Pack Wings Track Pack

1234
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:17,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob Seger Track Pack, Her Strut, and Get Out of Denver

1235
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:31,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio

1236
01:28:53,905 --> 01:28:55,786
[SPEAKER_10]: PC Game Purchases are in fact digital.

1237
01:29:23,587 --> 01:29:25,189
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop for PC Games

1238
01:29:38,777 --> 01:29:46,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, according to the survey, 93% of PC gamers bought at least one game digitally in the past 12 months.

1239
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,280
[SPEAKER_05]: 71% bought four games digitally.

1240
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:50,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

1241
01:29:50,121 --> 01:29:54,322
[SPEAKER_05]: But then I think about some of those games like PopCap and those types of games.

1242
01:29:54,842 --> 01:29:59,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I bring this up because obviously they're huge, casual PC games.

1243
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:05,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people go to the site, download the trial game, and then you can put your credit card number in online and get the full version.

1244
01:30:05,626 --> 01:30:07,307
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a digital distribution right there.

1245
01:30:08,127 --> 01:30:11,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that necessarily means half of all games are bought off Steam.

1246
01:30:11,609 --> 01:30:12,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's necessarily what it means.

1247
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:24,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it goes a little deeper than that, especially when you filter in these classic games from a site like Yahoo Games or whatever, where you can click now and put in your credit card number to get the full version of Diner Dash 5.

1248
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:32,457
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of not surprising in a way, but interesting.

1249
01:30:32,977 --> 01:30:34,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, very interesting.

1250
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:35,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Know what else is interesting?

1251
01:30:35,796 --> 01:30:38,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that means the shelf space is going to continue to shrink.

1252
01:30:38,198 --> 01:30:39,118
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is interesting, Loki?

1253
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:47,365
[SPEAKER_06]: People finding different things about LittleBigPlanet, including some upcoming patch details.

1254
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:50,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently this was leaked out from a photo that was on...

1255
01:30:51,898 --> 01:30:54,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Media Monocles Flickr page.

1256
01:30:54,900 --> 01:31:03,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look very closely, you'll notice that there's a whiteboard with a bunch of different information about download content and updates.

1257
01:31:04,086 --> 01:31:20,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And the next one that's on the list there, which I can't quite see the code name for, but it will include new tutorials and online creation mode, where you'll be able to work with other players and create your own levels online.

1258
01:31:20,978 --> 01:31:21,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1259
01:31:22,582 --> 01:31:28,927
[SPEAKER_06]: apparently there's also going to be a new arcade pack at some point I don't know what exactly that is arcade pack?

1260
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:49,985
[SPEAKER_05]: that could be all kinds of cool but something else I'm trying to see code name what are your thoughts on LittleBigPlanet, RicePrincess you haven't talked a lot about it on the show but I know you love Wii, you hate 360 so PS3's got to be a nice neutral ground what do you think about LittleBigPlanet?

1261
01:31:50,645 --> 01:31:51,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I've never played it

1262
01:31:51,943 --> 01:31:52,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1263
01:31:52,543 --> 01:31:52,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Really.

1264
01:31:52,904 --> 01:31:53,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it.

1265
01:31:53,644 --> 01:31:54,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a lot of fun.

1266
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:56,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my favorite game that came out last year.

1267
01:31:56,605 --> 01:31:56,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1268
01:31:57,046 --> 01:31:57,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I love it.

1269
01:31:57,726 --> 01:31:59,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a PS3.

1270
01:31:59,707 --> 01:32:02,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta see how cheesy some of the user levels are.

1271
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:04,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's how you will like it.

1272
01:32:04,169 --> 01:32:08,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on there and play the Warcraft-inspired Onyxia's Lair level.

1273
01:32:08,972 --> 01:32:09,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1274
01:32:09,372 --> 01:32:10,713
[SPEAKER_10]: No word to the time frame?

1275
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:39,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no.

1276
01:32:40,252 --> 01:32:45,656
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, this is, you know, based off information that's coming off of a picture of a whiteboard.

1277
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:56,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... Well, still, you know, if the studio themselves put up the picture, I would actually say that is a pretty respectable source.

1278
01:32:57,003 --> 01:33:00,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't think they're going to think to quick erase the whiteboard, we're spilling all our secrets.

1279
01:33:01,425 --> 01:33:01,866
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

1280
01:33:03,266 --> 01:33:05,268
[SPEAKER_06]: You're spilling your secrets onto the whiteboard.

1281
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:05,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha!

1282
01:33:06,812 --> 01:33:08,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm laughing at chat.

1283
01:33:08,272 --> 01:33:09,513
[SPEAKER_05]: AcidicVampire in chat.

1284
01:33:10,993 --> 01:33:12,533
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting read a lot tonight, buddy.

1285
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:13,633
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying a lot of funny things.

1286
01:33:14,054 --> 01:33:16,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, Sky, play the Parker Posey level.

1287
01:33:16,514 --> 01:33:18,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not popular, but it's great.

1288
01:33:18,654 --> 01:33:19,035
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1289
01:33:19,175 --> 01:33:20,835
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Parker Posey level?

1290
01:33:21,055 --> 01:33:23,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I want to play it so bad.

1291
01:33:23,676 --> 01:33:25,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to do that right after the show.

1292
01:33:25,396 --> 01:33:27,096
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because I'm going to play Resident Evil 5.

1293
01:33:27,136 --> 01:33:29,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to push you if you don't let me.

1294
01:33:29,717 --> 01:33:30,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to...

1295
01:33:31,712 --> 01:33:33,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I get to unlock stickers of Parker Posey?

1296
01:33:34,393 --> 01:33:35,674
[SPEAKER_05]: If so, I'm so sold.

1297
01:33:36,554 --> 01:33:37,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Party Girl and everything?

1298
01:33:39,876 --> 01:33:40,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

1299
01:33:43,537 --> 01:33:45,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Nathan is now suddenly interested in LittleBigPlanet?

1300
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:48,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll go play it right now.

1301
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:48,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now.

1302
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:50,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1303
01:33:54,204 --> 01:34:00,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, speaking of games that I want to play right now, I can't play this right now, but apparently it's going to be in development.

1304
01:34:00,747 --> 01:34:03,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Tron, a new game, a new Tron game.

1305
01:34:03,949 --> 01:34:06,951
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they showed that trailer for Tron 2 or TR2N.

1306
01:34:08,434 --> 01:34:10,034
[SPEAKER_05]: What they showed at Comic-Con.

1307
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:13,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there is a game coming out for this whole thing as well.

1308
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: This is according to Variety.

1309
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:25,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though there were some issues with the Disney video game company, Variety Magazine is reporting that apparently Disney is shipping to game developers a concept for TR2N or Tron 2.

1310
01:34:26,518 --> 01:34:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, no idea what it's going to be like or anything.

1311
01:34:29,619 --> 01:34:30,939
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course this makes me think, okay...

1312
01:34:31,897 --> 01:34:35,260
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a Tron 2.0, and it wasn't very well received.

1313
01:34:36,101 --> 01:34:38,923
[SPEAKER_05]: But the original Tron game was awesome.

1314
01:34:40,164 --> 01:34:40,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Never played it.

1315
01:34:41,145 --> 01:34:41,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty awesome.

1316
01:34:41,906 --> 01:34:46,249
[SPEAKER_05]: They have it on Xbox Live, and it was one of those games that was better in the 80s.

1317
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:49,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you play it now, you're kind of like, oh, this game is better left in my imagination.

1318
01:34:50,013 --> 01:34:52,074
[SPEAKER_05]: But it still was pretty cool, especially for an 80s game.

1319
01:34:53,476 --> 01:34:57,239
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think about reinventing franchises?

1320
01:34:57,799 --> 01:34:58,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Such as Tron?

1321
01:34:59,341 --> 01:34:59,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1322
01:35:01,553 --> 01:35:03,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay with it, I guess.

1323
01:35:03,154 --> 01:35:03,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1324
01:35:04,495 --> 01:35:08,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I think especially a series like Tron needed a sequel a long time ago.

1325
01:35:08,298 --> 01:35:09,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems a little late.

1326
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:13,342
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when you look at a series like The Goonies, or there is no series there, right?

1327
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:14,523
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need to make a Goonies 2.

1328
01:35:14,984 --> 01:35:16,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if they made a Goonies 2, you know it's going to be stupid.

1329
01:35:16,765 --> 01:35:17,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was Goonies.

1330
01:35:17,365 --> 01:35:18,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Or The Karate Kid?

1331
01:35:18,106 --> 01:35:18,326
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just no.

1332
01:35:18,386 --> 01:35:21,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you talking about the movie or the game?

1333
01:35:22,029 --> 01:35:22,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the movie.

1334
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:24,271
[SPEAKER_05]: The game was amazing.

1335
01:35:24,651 --> 01:35:26,112
[SPEAKER_05]: That's another classic game of the week.

1336
01:35:26,132 --> 01:35:27,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that game so much.

1337
01:35:27,433 --> 01:35:28,393
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was amazing.

1338
01:35:28,474 --> 01:35:29,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Heck yes.

1339
01:35:29,174 --> 01:35:29,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1340
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:31,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you did that as a classic game already.

1341
01:35:32,256 --> 01:35:33,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if DarkSakura has ever done it.

1342
01:35:33,997 --> 01:35:36,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to check the wiki, but I don't think it's ever been a classic game.

1343
01:35:37,219 --> 01:35:41,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to check the wiki on our own show.

1344
01:35:41,741 --> 01:35:47,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we've done the Classic Game of the Week for at least a year now, so I don't know every single game we've highlighted.

1345
01:35:47,223 --> 01:35:47,823
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot.

1346
01:35:48,203 --> 01:35:51,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, we have a wiki and the fans update the wiki because they're awesome.

1347
01:35:52,505 --> 01:35:54,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Silent Nathan run in the house really to go play PlayStation 3?

1348
01:35:54,865 --> 01:35:57,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably that jerkwad.

1349
01:35:57,606 --> 01:35:59,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Nathan, you're cool.

1350
01:36:00,687 --> 01:36:01,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And not a jerkwad at all.

1351
01:36:01,928 --> 01:36:04,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, so yeah, Neutron game in development.

1352
01:36:06,087 --> 01:36:07,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably to come out with a movie.

1353
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:14,814
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can find somebody to take the financial hit for all the development, I guess, in this economy.

1354
01:36:15,154 --> 01:36:16,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney does have their own studio.

1355
01:36:17,956 --> 01:36:18,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's been hurting.

1356
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:21,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because they put out Turok.

1357
01:36:21,799 --> 01:36:22,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

1358
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:27,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have told you that Turok's going to suck before they even put Turok out.

1359
01:36:27,943 --> 01:36:28,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, really?

1360
01:36:28,624 --> 01:36:29,805
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to put Turok out?

1361
01:36:30,225 --> 01:36:30,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1362
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:32,447
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something you think is a great idea?

1363
01:36:32,867 --> 01:36:34,528
[SPEAKER_10]: The economy is going downhill.

1364
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:35,469
[SPEAKER_10]: What game should we make?

1365
01:36:35,809 --> 01:36:36,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Turok!

1366
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:38,372
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great idea!

1367
01:36:38,452 --> 01:36:41,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Amaze Satsuma in chat wonders if Sky wants a Showgirls 2.

1368
01:36:42,637 --> 01:36:44,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You know there was supposed to be a Showgirls 2.

1369
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:49,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at the end of Showgirls 1 it alludes to the fact that Nomi Malone is going to Hollywood.

1370
01:36:50,326 --> 01:36:52,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And Showgirls 2 was supposed to be a parody on Hollywood.

1371
01:36:52,848 --> 01:36:54,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the first one was a parody on Vegas.

1372
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:55,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But then the movie came out.

1373
01:36:57,179 --> 01:36:59,080
[SPEAKER_05]: and they decided to can a sequel.

1374
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

1375
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be in full support of a Showgirls 2, but not now.

1376
01:37:03,221 --> 01:37:05,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Elizabeth Berkley's not going to do it.

1377
01:37:05,102 --> 01:37:05,662
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the point?

1378
01:37:06,302 --> 01:37:12,825
[SPEAKER_06]: The point is that we have all these wonderful porn studios that can develop a movie now.

1379
01:37:12,845 --> 01:37:22,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're doing more theatrical movies and hell, they have all the knockoffs, like all the TV show ones, like Not the Bradys, Not the Monsters, Not Bewitched.

1380
01:37:23,369 --> 01:37:26,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the other ones are, but

1381
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:31,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... Not My Three Sons?

1382
01:37:32,395 --> 01:37:33,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure about that one.

1383
01:37:33,356 --> 01:37:35,058
[SPEAKER_05]: How come porn studios don't get into gaming?

1384
01:37:35,278 --> 01:37:37,680
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you see all these legitimate movie studios getting into games.

1385
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:43,085
[SPEAKER_06]: There's porn actresses that are in the gaming, but, you know, not... I don't know.

1386
01:37:44,707 --> 01:37:46,629
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people that love World of Warcraft...

1387
01:37:47,963 --> 01:37:49,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but there are.

1388
01:38:09,308 --> 01:38:09,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1389
01:38:09,668 --> 01:38:10,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, think about it.

1390
01:38:10,589 --> 01:38:15,493
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a stripper, you're working nights, you're probably home during the day with a kid.

1391
01:38:15,953 --> 01:38:20,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of reminded, I don't know if you've ever seen The Guild, but I'm kind of reminded of Carla from The Guild.

1392
01:38:21,978 --> 01:38:22,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, she's a nerd.

1393
01:38:22,899 --> 01:38:28,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Who, by the way, is by far my favorite character on that program.

1394
01:38:29,104 --> 01:38:32,026
[SPEAKER_10]: But the stripper that's local that plays WoW, she's a nerd.

1395
01:38:32,226 --> 01:38:35,049
[SPEAKER_10]: She's an Asian girl, and her stage name's Katana.

1396
01:38:35,069 --> 01:38:35,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1397
01:38:35,956 --> 01:38:37,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the one.

1398
01:38:37,798 --> 01:38:38,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's totally the one.

1399
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:39,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking dork.

1400
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:40,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1401
01:38:40,941 --> 01:38:44,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we just have a six degrees of stripper here in the studio?

1402
01:38:44,205 --> 01:38:44,525
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1403
01:38:44,565 --> 01:38:47,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we just found out that Loki and Rice Princess know the same stripper?

1404
01:38:47,748 --> 01:38:48,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know that stripper?

1405
01:38:49,370 --> 01:38:52,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know her, but I've seen her boobies.

1406
01:38:53,074 --> 01:38:57,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know her that well, but... I know her in the biblical sense.

1407
01:38:58,139 --> 01:38:59,220
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know...

1408
01:39:01,658 --> 01:39:02,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1409
01:39:21,627 --> 01:39:22,988
[SPEAKER_06]: about games and shit.

1410
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you mentioned that you do a game podcast.

1411
01:39:25,491 --> 01:39:26,832
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, oh my god, I play games too!

1412
01:39:26,852 --> 01:39:28,393
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so funny.

1413
01:39:28,433 --> 01:39:30,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, how does that even come up in conversation?

1414
01:39:31,276 --> 01:39:32,317
[SPEAKER_10]: So what do you do?

1415
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:33,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're like, well, actually, I have a game podcast.

1416
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:34,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the thing.

1417
01:39:34,759 --> 01:39:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because, you know, to get into how strip clubs operate, they have to wait until the new song begins.

1418
01:39:41,906 --> 01:39:45,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you're paying for a lap dance, it's for X number of songs.

1419
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:46,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're not just going to start...

1420
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:51,033
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's in the middle of a song, you have to sit there and wait for the new song.

1421
01:39:51,273 --> 01:39:53,674
[SPEAKER_06]: During that time, it's you, so what do you do?

1422
01:39:54,734 --> 01:39:55,435
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

1423
01:39:55,755 --> 01:39:56,395
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of stuff.

1424
01:39:57,096 --> 01:39:58,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the games come up.

1425
01:39:58,857 --> 01:40:00,837
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I do is games.

1426
01:40:00,877 --> 01:40:05,220
[SPEAKER_05]: The time I got a lap dance, because I went to the strip club once, and my friends, you were there, Irene, right?

1427
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,322
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends made me say which stripper I thought was the hottest.

1428
01:40:10,042 --> 01:40:14,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Naturally, I said the one that looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, because there was a stripper there that looked just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

1429
01:40:15,305 --> 01:40:15,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And she...

1430
01:40:16,445 --> 01:40:17,266
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1431
01:40:37,783 --> 01:40:38,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Honey, it's nothing against you.

1432
01:40:38,944 --> 01:40:39,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gay.

1433
01:40:40,085 --> 01:40:42,187
[SPEAKER_05]: And she says, oh, I can kind of tell.

1434
01:40:42,287 --> 01:40:44,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And then she's just sitting there and she's talking to me.

1435
01:40:44,249 --> 01:40:46,250
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, oh, my roommate's gay and I love him.

1436
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:46,691
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the best.

1437
01:40:46,871 --> 01:40:48,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And so she's talking to me for like a whole nother song.

1438
01:40:49,173 --> 01:40:53,757
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was really awkward because she had no clothes on except a thong.

1439
01:40:53,817 --> 01:40:55,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was kind of strange.

1440
01:40:55,798 --> 01:40:58,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just kind of like, just put a T-shirt on or something.

1441
01:40:58,921 --> 01:41:01,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And acidic vampire says, Rob loves the boobies.

1442
01:41:01,423 --> 01:41:02,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, especially when he's drunk.

1443
01:41:03,244 --> 01:41:03,645
Yeah.

1444
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:07,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob might be gay, but he loves titties.

1445
01:41:07,582 --> 01:41:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: All gay guys like boobies.

1446
01:41:08,982 --> 01:41:09,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is.

1447
01:41:09,883 --> 01:41:11,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess everybody really likes boobies.

1448
01:41:11,743 --> 01:41:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't like boobies?

1449
01:41:12,783 --> 01:41:13,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Women like boobies.

1450
01:41:13,724 --> 01:41:14,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, women do.

1451
01:41:15,584 --> 01:41:16,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Like me.

1452
01:41:16,825 --> 01:41:19,786
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, you were going to say something, Nathan?

1453
01:41:20,646 --> 01:41:25,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out, though, some props in chat for the strip club with the wife.

1454
01:41:25,728 --> 01:41:29,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some folks in chat are like, Game Guru says, wait, wait, wait, you go to the strip club with your wife?

1455
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:31,910
[SPEAKER_10]: She loves going.

1456
01:41:32,924 --> 01:41:39,972
[SPEAKER_06]: And GameGuru says, your wife is the coolest.

1457
01:41:40,172 --> 01:41:47,941
[SPEAKER_06]: We seriously thought we were going to do this, but we were so fucking tired from the wedding day.

1458
01:41:48,322 --> 01:41:51,185
[SPEAKER_06]: We were seriously going to go in our wedding garb.

1459
01:41:51,545 --> 01:42:14,049
[SPEAKER_06]: to the strip club we were almost going to do it but we were so exhausted like during the wedding we were like dude yeah we should totally go afterwards just dressed up in the tux and everything because that would be hilarious but we were just like so beat at the end of the day it's like fuck that we're not going anywhere nice go sleep yeah boobs are awesome

1460
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:16,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1461
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:18,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma says, Sky, you're a hypocrite.

1462
01:42:18,031 --> 01:42:20,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a problem with a woman in a bra and panties at a strip bar.

1463
01:42:21,554 --> 01:42:21,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold up.

1464
01:42:22,114 --> 01:42:23,435
[SPEAKER_05]: She had no bra on, okay?

1465
01:42:23,475 --> 01:42:23,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1466
01:42:23,855 --> 01:42:24,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Just panties.

1467
01:42:24,696 --> 01:42:25,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Full titties.

1468
01:42:25,396 --> 01:42:26,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't even call it like panties.

1469
01:42:27,098 --> 01:42:30,520
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say panties, I think of like granny panties, you know?

1470
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:33,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Or like regular panties, not a thong.

1471
01:42:33,703 --> 01:42:34,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she had like a thong on.

1472
01:42:34,843 --> 01:42:35,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a G-string.

1473
01:42:35,484 --> 01:42:39,927
[SPEAKER_05]: But she'll happy go to a Rocky Horror Picture Show convention full of women in bra and panties.

1474
01:42:39,967 --> 01:42:40,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's different.

1475
01:42:40,528 --> 01:42:41,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not why you're going there.

1476
01:42:41,588 --> 01:42:42,109
[SPEAKER_05]: That's theater.

1477
01:42:42,189 --> 01:42:42,729
[SPEAKER_05]: That's art.

1478
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:43,610
It's art.

1479
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:44,130
It's art.

1480
01:42:45,872 --> 01:42:49,295
[SPEAKER_10]: That's funny that you're laughing at that.

1481
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:56,022
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, yes, there are a lot of people in all occupations that play World of Warcraft, even strippers.

1482
01:42:56,102 --> 01:43:00,286
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, oh, I strip, therefore I cannot play games at all.

1483
01:43:00,446 --> 01:43:02,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, porn stars, strippers...

1484
01:43:03,885 --> 01:43:04,326
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1485
01:43:19,864 --> 01:43:24,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa is in chat again saying, they make all sorts of terrible porn games.

1486
01:43:24,227 --> 01:43:26,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember how I said earlier, why don't porn studios make games?

1487
01:43:27,149 --> 01:43:30,552
[SPEAKER_05]: They make all sorts of terrible porn games, but they're usually multiplayer online.

1488
01:43:30,632 --> 01:43:34,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned this by working in the porn capital of the world, Chatsworth, California.

1489
01:43:34,534 --> 01:43:35,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, two comments to that.

1490
01:43:36,236 --> 01:43:43,861
[SPEAKER_05]: A, I should have figured that out because on porn websites, so I've heard, you see a lot of times ads for those multiplayer sex things.

1491
01:43:43,881 --> 01:43:44,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've heard.

1492
01:43:44,682 --> 01:43:46,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just heard through Loki.

1493
01:43:46,323 --> 01:43:46,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Through your eyes.

1494
01:43:47,023 --> 01:43:48,884
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you see on those sites.

1495
01:43:49,025 --> 01:43:50,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess you're right.

1496
01:43:50,365 --> 01:43:52,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't think of them because they're not really out there and about.

1497
01:43:53,187 --> 01:43:56,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And B, I did not realize Chatsworth, California was the capital of the porn industry.

1498
01:43:56,850 --> 01:43:57,831
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't surprise me.

1499
01:43:58,111 --> 01:44:03,194
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've ever been to Chatsworth, California, it's, you know.

1500
01:44:03,374 --> 01:44:04,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it better than Buttonwillow?

1501
01:44:05,115 --> 01:44:06,256
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than Buttonwillow.

1502
01:44:06,576 --> 01:44:10,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say Fresno is probably better than Chatsworth.

1503
01:44:10,839 --> 01:44:11,320
Yeah.

1504
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:14,861
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like how we're only laughing because everybody else doesn't live in California.

1505
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:16,102
[SPEAKER_05]: No offense to the people there.

1506
01:44:17,422 --> 01:44:17,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1507
01:44:18,883 --> 01:44:19,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Wink wink hint hint.

1508
01:44:20,343 --> 01:44:21,764
[SPEAKER_07]: My grandma's from there.

1509
01:44:22,084 --> 01:44:25,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Her movie comes out next month.

1510
01:44:26,579 --> 01:44:26,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

1511
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:27,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

1512
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:28,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Gilf.

1513
01:44:31,004 --> 01:44:34,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Marissa also says, Rob can have some of my boob to play with.

1514
01:44:34,669 --> 01:44:35,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Stress toys.

1515
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,271
[SPEAKER_05]: I have too much anyway.

1516
01:44:36,612 --> 01:44:38,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa has some nice big boobies.

1517
01:44:38,835 --> 01:44:42,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I would definitely help relieve some stress.

1518
01:44:44,122 --> 01:44:49,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Your own stress all day with her boobs.

1519
01:44:49,663 --> 01:44:51,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we move on back into video games?

1520
01:44:51,784 --> 01:44:58,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how we got on the whole topic of strippers from Tron.

1521
01:44:58,865 --> 01:45:00,745
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last story we just did was Tron.

1522
01:45:00,765 --> 01:45:01,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out.

1523
01:45:02,166 --> 01:45:09,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And then suddenly it's about strippers playing World of Warcraft and boobies in Chatsworth, California being the porn capital of the world.

1524
01:45:10,163 --> 01:45:14,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely would pay good money to see a stripper that's glowing in the Tron outfit.

1525
01:45:16,884 --> 01:45:17,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1526
01:45:17,405 --> 01:45:21,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, there's that guy on the internet, the Tron guy, who wears that outfit.

1527
01:45:21,645 --> 01:45:25,106
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, not him, but imagine if a woman wore that outfit.

1528
01:45:25,126 --> 01:45:25,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he hot?

1529
01:45:25,586 --> 01:45:28,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want to see a woman the size of the Tron guy wearing that outfit.

1530
01:45:30,227 --> 01:45:30,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1531
01:45:30,607 --> 01:45:32,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't process this much data.

1532
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:37,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Knight in chat says, thank God Jamie's not here for this one.

1533
01:45:38,189 --> 01:45:38,549
[SPEAKER_05]: You know...

1534
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably would have derailed even if she was here.

1535
01:45:42,862 --> 01:45:46,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not the fact that Jamie's not here, it's the fact that Rice Princess is here.

1536
01:45:46,544 --> 01:45:46,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey.

1537
01:45:48,266 --> 01:45:49,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't bring up... Wait, yes I did.

1538
01:45:50,507 --> 01:45:51,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes you did!

1539
01:45:51,528 --> 01:45:52,429
[SPEAKER_10]: La la la, let's move on.

1540
01:45:52,529 --> 01:45:56,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, you and Loki have this whole six degrees of strippers thing going on here.

1541
01:45:56,772 --> 01:46:01,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Or we just both live in the same town and both go to the same strip club.

1542
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:04,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Why am I not being invited to said strip club?

1543
01:46:04,097 --> 01:46:05,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't gone in like three years.

1544
01:46:05,158 --> 01:46:07,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't gone in like a year or two.

1545
01:46:07,299 --> 01:46:07,820
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to...

1546
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:08,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Fix this.

1547
01:46:09,081 --> 01:46:10,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time.

1548
01:46:10,501 --> 01:46:15,764
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just because you go to the strip club and afterwards you're like, that cost me a lot of money for very little time.

1549
01:46:16,125 --> 01:46:17,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the fuck did I do that?

1550
01:46:17,385 --> 01:46:19,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you forget about it after a while.

1551
01:46:19,286 --> 01:46:21,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have Guilty Gear news, right, Loki?

1552
01:46:21,648 --> 01:46:24,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, speaking of guilt for spending all that money at strip clubs.

1553
01:46:26,934 --> 01:46:29,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus

1554
01:46:57,625 --> 01:46:58,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I almost vomited.

1555
01:47:16,368 --> 01:47:17,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so Guilty Gear, yeah.

1556
01:47:17,829 --> 01:47:18,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1557
01:47:18,669 --> 01:47:19,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be coming out.

1558
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:21,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it's not the new Guilty Gear.

1559
01:47:21,571 --> 01:47:24,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, wait, that wasn't, it was something blue.

1560
01:47:24,932 --> 01:47:26,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget what they called it.

1561
01:47:26,233 --> 01:47:28,754
[SPEAKER_06]: The new game, it's not Guilty Gear, but it's done by the same people.

1562
01:47:29,174 --> 01:47:33,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all, like, HD, or not cel-shaded, but, like, hand-drawn animation stuff.

1563
01:47:34,437 --> 01:47:34,917
[SPEAKER_10]: No idea.

1564
01:47:38,059 --> 01:47:38,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1565
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:41,501
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's move on to the mailbag.

1566
01:47:41,561 --> 01:47:47,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the part of the show every week that you guys can send us an email, and we'll read it here on the show and respond to whatever's in it or make fun of it.

1567
01:47:48,244 --> 01:47:48,924
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the two will happen.

1568
01:47:50,605 --> 01:47:54,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We invite your emails to be sent in to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1569
01:47:54,327 --> 01:47:58,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Although we didn't have a whole lot this week, that's probably because our podcast feed was behind a little bit.

1570
01:47:58,829 --> 01:48:00,610
[SPEAKER_05]: But by the way, it is getting caught up.

1571
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:02,411
[SPEAKER_05]: A new show just went out today, so go look for it.

1572
01:48:02,871 --> 01:48:05,572
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have at least one email to read, and it's from Australia.

1573
01:48:05,632 --> 01:48:07,473
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Mike in Australia.

1574
01:48:08,803 --> 01:48:11,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike in Australia says, Hello to all in studio.

1575
01:48:11,204 --> 01:48:13,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Loki, Silent Nathan, and Rice Princess.

1576
01:48:13,145 --> 01:48:14,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he must be listening right now.

1577
01:48:14,086 --> 01:48:14,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1578
01:48:14,586 --> 01:48:15,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he knew exactly who was on the show.

1579
01:48:15,807 --> 01:48:16,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hello.

1580
01:48:16,947 --> 01:48:23,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had the opportunity to listen live two weeks in a row, which is a treat considering during your halftime Puppy Bowl music break, it's coming up to 2 p.m.

1581
01:48:24,211 --> 01:48:25,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So generally, I'm at work.

1582
01:48:26,252 --> 01:48:29,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Firstly, I want to ask your thoughts about some good platform games on the DS.

1583
01:48:29,673 --> 01:48:33,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an Xbox 360 or PS3, so I'm stuck with the DS Lite, which is good enough at the moment.

1584
01:48:34,074 --> 01:48:38,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I've acquired Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, but haven't really gotten into yet, played the first level or so.

1585
01:48:39,455 --> 01:48:43,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm slowly playing through Yoshi Island DS, so if you can suggest anything similar, that would be good.

1586
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:47,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I finish, I just want to say great show as always, and really enjoy listening to your shows.

1587
01:48:48,196 --> 01:48:50,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, and hope to listen live again soon.

1588
01:48:50,737 --> 01:48:50,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike.

1589
01:48:51,497 --> 01:48:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

1590
01:48:52,157 --> 01:48:55,938
[SPEAKER_05]: This email is not sponsored by anyone, but for you guys to learn a new Australian term,

1591
01:48:56,358 --> 01:48:59,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Budgie... Bud... Budgie Smugglers.

1592
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:01,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the email's brought to us by Budgie Smugglers.

1593
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:03,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Explanation from Urban Dictionary.

1594
01:49:04,221 --> 01:49:07,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Australian slang term for men's tight-fitting Speedo-style swimwear.

1595
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:12,204
[SPEAKER_05]: The lump in the front apparently resembles a budgie when it is stuffed down the front of someone's shorts.

1596
01:49:12,224 --> 01:49:12,884
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a budgie?

1597
01:49:13,364 --> 01:49:14,465
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I want to know.

1598
01:49:15,125 --> 01:49:16,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that like a Snuggie?

1599
01:49:18,894 --> 01:49:19,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I bet it is.

1600
01:49:19,935 --> 01:49:21,936
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the Australian version of a grape.

1601
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:22,716
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1602
01:49:22,996 --> 01:49:24,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, look, back to the question at hand.

1603
01:49:24,777 --> 01:49:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: How about some DS platform games?

1604
01:49:27,459 --> 01:49:29,600
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I haven't played a whole lot on DS as of late.

1605
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:33,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I have this thing against playing games on DS for some reason.

1606
01:49:33,602 --> 01:49:37,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I like playing games on the TV, but to help our poor guy out, what are some games?

1607
01:49:37,905 --> 01:49:41,207
[SPEAKER_05]: See, even when I'm playing the DS, I'm playing a lot of RPGs, like Final Fantasy IV or Mario.

1608
01:49:41,587 --> 01:49:43,108
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to just know good DS games?

1609
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:45,368
[SPEAKER_05]: No, well, platformers specifically.

1610
01:49:45,408 --> 01:49:48,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like Castlevania, Yoshi Island.

1611
01:49:48,529 --> 01:49:50,410
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some other good platformer games?

1612
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:51,350
[SPEAKER_05]: New Super Mario Bros.

1613
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:52,710
[SPEAKER_05]: is definitely one of the classics.

1614
01:49:52,730 --> 01:49:54,130
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have that yet, you've got to get that.

1615
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:55,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to look to chat, too, for some hints.

1616
01:49:56,211 --> 01:49:57,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat, what are some good ones?

1617
01:49:57,771 --> 01:49:58,811
[SPEAKER_06]: New games that have come out.

1618
01:49:59,052 --> 01:50:05,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there's a new Kirby game, Kirby Super Star Ultra, which is port.

1619
01:50:06,353 --> 01:50:08,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's... Was it...

1620
01:50:10,234 --> 01:50:12,697
[SPEAKER_06]: The Chase, Phoenix meets Felicity.

1621
01:50:13,698 --> 01:50:17,241
[SPEAKER_06]: That's supposed to be kind of like Kirby's Canada's Curse.

1622
01:50:18,022 --> 01:50:20,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other platformer games.

1623
01:50:20,645 --> 01:50:24,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's a lot of crappy games that have come out that have been like platformers.

1624
01:50:24,288 --> 01:50:25,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't N out on the DS?

1625
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:27,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't they release a version of N?

1626
01:50:27,111 --> 01:50:28,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's kind of a neat little game.

1627
01:50:28,552 --> 01:50:29,293
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming out.

1628
01:50:30,054 --> 01:50:30,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Or that's already out.

1629
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:31,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And then...

1630
01:50:34,916 --> 01:50:37,057
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru in chat suggests Sonic Rush.

1631
01:50:37,177 --> 01:50:38,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than the console Sonics.

1632
01:50:39,498 --> 01:50:43,780
[SPEAKER_07]: You would definitely also have to pick up the Chrono Trigger for the DS.

1633
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,683
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a platform game, but it's way better than any of the games you've already mentioned.

1634
01:50:48,423 --> 01:50:50,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a budgie is a bird.

1635
01:50:50,684 --> 01:50:51,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a parakeet.

1636
01:50:52,225 --> 01:50:52,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

1637
01:50:53,886 --> 01:50:54,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously?

1638
01:50:55,887 --> 01:50:58,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I learn new things on this show every day.

1639
01:50:58,228 --> 01:50:58,989
[SPEAKER_10]: The more you know.

1640
01:50:59,009 --> 01:50:59,389
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

1641
01:51:02,267 --> 01:51:03,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

1642
01:51:03,307 --> 01:51:06,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And some other folks in the chat room do agree with Sonic Rush, so there you go.

1643
01:51:06,328 --> 01:51:08,748
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't own that one yet, you should probably check out Sonic Rush.

1644
01:51:09,849 --> 01:51:12,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun, though, suggests Tony Hawk's American Skateland.

1645
01:51:12,229 --> 01:51:13,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a platform game, sort of.

1646
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:14,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1647
01:51:15,170 --> 01:51:15,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1648
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:18,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some suggestions from us to you.

1649
01:51:18,451 --> 01:51:21,151
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an email you want to send us, mailbag at orangelongerator.com.

1650
01:51:21,171 --> 01:51:25,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to hear more international slang terms, like budgie smugglers.

1651
01:51:25,312 --> 01:51:27,993
[SPEAKER_05]: That was definitely educational.

1652
01:51:29,073 --> 01:51:29,433
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1653
01:51:31,814 --> 01:51:32,735
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you say, Nathan?

1654
01:51:33,215 --> 01:51:37,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Next time you put on a Speedo, look down and it will resemble a parakeet in your pants.

1655
01:51:37,417 --> 01:51:40,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's going to be a next time I'm going to put on a Speedo.

1656
01:51:40,298 --> 01:51:41,939
[SPEAKER_05]: All natural.

1657
01:51:45,420 --> 01:51:49,602
[SPEAKER_05]: If I go swimming, I wear swimming trunks.

1658
01:51:49,822 --> 01:51:57,166
[SPEAKER_05]: In this country, it's not appropriate usually to wear Speedos to the beach unless you are really good looking, and I'm not really good looking, sadly.

1659
01:51:57,266 --> 01:51:57,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1660
01:51:58,817 --> 01:52:00,018
[SPEAKER_10]: People do it anyway.

1661
01:52:00,278 --> 01:52:00,838
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

1662
01:52:01,278 --> 01:52:04,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Tron guy wears that whole thing in public, so whatever.

1663
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:06,060
[SPEAKER_05]: He does.

1664
01:52:07,621 --> 01:52:08,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go on.

1665
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:10,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some more gaming news.

1666
01:52:10,882 --> 01:52:13,103
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to the Skype line soon also, by the way, guys.

1667
01:52:13,163 --> 01:52:14,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype line opening up a little later.

1668
01:52:14,926 --> 01:52:21,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's a game if you're a fan of the Jump Superstars games that they have on the DS.

1669
01:52:21,831 --> 01:52:24,713
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new Konami PSP Brawler coming out.

1670
01:52:26,574 --> 01:52:31,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And no word on... Let's see here what the title is on it.

1671
01:52:31,478 --> 01:52:36,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's got... Oh, Sunday X Magazine is the...

1672
01:52:38,694 --> 01:52:40,556
[SPEAKER_06]: and all the other characters.

1673
01:52:56,866 --> 01:52:58,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Arms, Inuyasha, Jump Ultimate Stars,

1674
01:53:17,662 --> 01:53:21,804
[SPEAKER_06]: was okay, it was a neat fighting game on the DS it was kind of like Smash Bros.

1675
01:53:21,844 --> 01:53:42,413
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit but the way that you use they had a bottom portion of your screen that you can align different manga panels and you would get different abilities and assist characters and stuff like that based on what you had in there and you had to fit them in so it's almost like the sticker system on Smash Bros.

1676
01:53:42,453 --> 01:53:45,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl it's kind of neat I see

1677
01:53:46,633 --> 01:53:47,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1678
01:54:08,619 --> 01:54:08,899
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1679
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:11,281
[SPEAKER_05]: More PSP the merrier, I suppose.

1680
01:54:30,111 --> 01:54:33,936
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 players in this game 10 on 10 robot battles

1681
01:54:47,233 --> 01:54:47,833
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

1682
01:54:47,853 --> 01:54:49,154
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1683
01:54:49,275 --> 01:54:49,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1684
01:54:49,535 --> 01:54:49,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play it.

1685
01:54:49,975 --> 01:54:52,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds awesome, but I don't think you'll ever see one on these shores.

1686
01:54:52,537 --> 01:54:53,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Just arcades aren't popular enough over here.

1687
01:54:54,058 --> 01:54:55,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a Dave & Buster's would be like your biggest bet.

1688
01:54:55,940 --> 01:55:01,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you may not have to have 20 cabinets, but I mean, it still could be, you know, cool.

1689
01:55:02,765 --> 01:55:04,906
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be cool, but I don't know if you're going to see it.

1690
01:55:05,006 --> 01:55:05,447
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

1691
01:55:05,787 --> 01:55:07,048
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably going to be expensive.

1692
01:55:07,608 --> 01:55:10,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's enough arcade stuff to justify it, sadly.

1693
01:55:11,611 --> 01:55:13,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we'll see.

1694
01:55:13,553 --> 01:55:13,873
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1695
01:55:13,913 --> 01:55:14,914
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, it is in development.

1696
01:55:15,492 --> 01:55:17,394
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1697
01:55:28,188 --> 01:55:28,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Block Peepo

1698
01:55:55,203 --> 01:56:01,149
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very unique looking and it's got a lot of the block things that are going to be in this bin.

1699
01:56:01,209 --> 01:56:05,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just have a feeling, you put that in an arcade, kids are going to be stealing that shit left and right.

1700
01:56:07,115 --> 01:56:07,735
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's neat.

1701
01:56:10,918 --> 01:56:12,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't kids just be more responsible?

1702
01:56:13,421 --> 01:56:14,222
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good one.

1703
01:56:14,522 --> 01:56:15,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Leo Shen agrees.

1704
01:56:15,463 --> 01:56:17,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Those blocks would get stolen so fast if it was in the US.

1705
01:56:18,005 --> 01:56:19,467
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd have to be all put on those cords.

1706
01:56:21,269 --> 01:56:22,231
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a mess.

1707
01:56:22,411 --> 01:56:25,937
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, crap, I can't put these blocks in there because of all these cords.

1708
01:56:25,977 --> 01:56:28,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I got stuck and tangled in these cords.

1709
01:56:28,581 --> 01:56:29,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the game.

1710
01:56:29,402 --> 01:56:29,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Help!

1711
01:56:32,031 --> 01:56:32,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Amplitude DS Amplitude DS

1712
01:57:01,351 --> 01:57:03,113
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go, there's a little clip of it.

1713
01:57:21,391 --> 01:57:27,576
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a scaled down, I know, all I can hear is the audio, but I'll tell you, it looks like a very scaled down version of Amplitude.

1714
01:57:28,076 --> 01:57:31,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you don't really have the hypnotic backgrounds that a game like Amplitude had.

1715
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:36,203
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you only have three tracks, but still, it's a start.

1716
01:57:36,943 --> 01:57:37,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something.

1717
01:57:38,364 --> 01:57:39,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bound to get sued.

1718
01:57:41,206 --> 01:57:46,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if that rumor from a few weeks back that Harmonix might be making a comeback with this stuff is true.

1719
01:57:48,097 --> 01:57:49,217
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, Supersonic Wii.

1720
01:57:49,297 --> 01:57:50,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can download it now.

1721
01:57:50,478 --> 01:57:51,518
[SPEAKER_06]: It's available out there.

1722
01:57:51,598 --> 01:57:57,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, if you want to check it out and you've got a homebrew-enabled Wii system, you know, definitely check this out.

1723
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:00,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, if you have a homebrew-enabled DS, you can check out Amplitude DS.

1724
01:58:02,702 --> 01:58:09,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, homebrewing any of those systems might violate your warranty, so be careful and don't say OLR told you to do it.

1725
01:58:09,205 --> 01:58:10,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Warranty's warranty.

1726
01:58:11,165 --> 01:58:12,106
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need that crap.

1727
01:58:13,606 --> 01:58:14,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1728
01:58:15,727 --> 01:58:15,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1729
01:58:17,281 --> 01:58:18,422
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1730
01:58:36,454 --> 01:58:37,795
[SPEAKER_06]: More like this game, I think.

1731
01:58:37,915 --> 01:58:39,696
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a combat racing game.

1732
01:58:39,936 --> 01:58:41,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll have 18 different levels.

1733
01:58:41,818 --> 01:58:46,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll feature 7 different cars, all with giant guns and weapons on them.

1734
01:58:47,362 --> 01:58:48,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Like any other car should have.

1735
01:58:49,763 --> 01:58:54,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a brand new game from a company called Team Six Studios.

1736
01:58:55,367 --> 01:58:56,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is their first Wii game.

1737
01:58:58,389 --> 01:58:58,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1738
01:58:58,990 --> 01:58:59,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks okay.

1739
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:01,972
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, we need a good combat racing game.

1740
01:59:01,992 --> 01:59:03,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And since they're not making another full auto game...

1741
01:59:05,523 --> 01:59:06,103
[SPEAKER_06]: DT Racer DT Carnage

1742
01:59:30,759 --> 01:59:37,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other games that got really cheap lately were the Need for Speed games because apparently they did not sell very well, the recent games they released.

1743
01:59:37,161 --> 01:59:40,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So EA decided if it worked for Batman, it's going to work for us.

1744
01:59:40,802 --> 01:59:42,562
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to reboot the franchise.

1745
01:59:43,042 --> 01:59:50,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're hitting the old reset button on the Need for Speed franchise, and they're going to release three new Need for Speed games in the year 2009.

1746
01:59:51,425 --> 01:59:55,806
[SPEAKER_05]: What's interesting, though, is that the whole kind of concept behind it, one for the core gamers...

1747
01:59:56,426 --> 01:59:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: One for the casual gamers, one for the online gamers.

1748
01:59:59,768 --> 02:00:01,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's an interesting approach to take with the games.

1749
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:08,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Need for Speed Shift is the game that's coming out on PlayStation 3, 360, PC, and PSP, and that's the core game.

1750
02:00:09,414 --> 02:00:10,434
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like Project Gotham.

1751
02:00:11,055 --> 02:00:12,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out in the fall as well.

1752
02:00:12,436 --> 02:00:19,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Need for Speed Nitro, that's coming out on the DS and the Wii, which you can probably guess is going to be the casual game.

1753
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's more like the original Need for Speed games.

1754
02:00:21,753 --> 02:00:24,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It also is supposed to have giant head racers and car vaulting.

1755
02:00:25,157 --> 02:00:25,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame!

1756
02:00:25,958 --> 02:00:26,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, car vaulting?

1757
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:32,445
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope this is not another fucking... Wait, wait, wait, that might just be like a vault to actually put your car in.

1758
02:00:32,985 --> 02:00:34,066
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's car vaulting.

1759
02:00:35,288 --> 02:00:36,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, stupid!

1760
02:00:37,009 --> 02:00:37,590
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

1761
02:00:38,351 --> 02:00:38,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1762
02:00:38,711 --> 02:00:39,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you like that?

1763
02:00:41,041 --> 02:00:54,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do like that, but, you know, the fact that Car Vaulting reminds me of the stupid Cruisin' game that they had come out, and that Cruisin' game was a rip-off, or actually a port of the, was it Not Need for Speed, the Fast and the Furious arcade game.

1764
02:00:55,492 --> 02:00:59,015
[SPEAKER_06]: The crappy Cruisin' USA-based one.

1765
02:01:00,214 --> 02:01:00,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1766
02:01:16,201 --> 02:01:17,943
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says you mean Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift Arcade.

1767
02:01:17,963 --> 02:01:18,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that at Walmart.

1768
02:01:19,064 --> 02:01:20,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's awful.

1769
02:01:20,185 --> 02:01:20,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where it belongs, too.

1770
02:01:20,945 --> 02:01:22,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what Cruisin' came out of.

1771
02:01:22,467 --> 02:01:23,608
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually what Cruisin' was.

1772
02:01:40,223 --> 02:01:42,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, a third game in the Need for Speed series.

1773
02:01:43,448 --> 02:01:46,834
[SPEAKER_05]: If the other two don't sound interesting to you, Need for Speed World Online.

1774
02:01:46,874 --> 02:01:50,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be a free online title.

1775
02:01:50,460 --> 02:01:53,785
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out in Asia first over the summer and then we'll get it in Christmas time.

1776
02:01:54,264 --> 02:02:01,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming you probably have to pay for car upgrades or something, probably based off the Asian model for MMOs where it's free, but then you have to pay for the good stuff.

1777
02:02:02,109 --> 02:02:03,890
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free, but your cars have no wheels.

1778
02:02:03,950 --> 02:02:04,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Pay extra for the wheels.

1779
02:02:05,991 --> 02:02:08,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, go!

1780
02:02:08,432 --> 02:02:08,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, crap.

1781
02:02:09,053 --> 02:02:09,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't go.

1782
02:02:09,893 --> 02:02:38,812
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way the games are all being developed by different studios even though Black Box apparently kind of got you know kind of well pink slipped a lot of them did Black Box is still working on Need for Speed World Online at least who's left with EA Singapore Need for Speed Nitro the casual one is by EA Montreal it's Arcade Racer is what they're calling it Need for Speed Shift coming by Slightly Mad they're the guys that made GT Legends and Blimey apparently is on it too GTR 2 Blimey

1783
02:02:39,272 --> 02:02:39,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Blimey!

1784
02:02:41,694 --> 02:02:42,135
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1785
02:02:43,095 --> 02:02:44,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of Need for Speed in 2009.

1786
02:02:44,196 --> 02:02:46,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you're a Need for Speed fan, that is exciting news.

1787
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:51,563
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chat, I believe, is a Need for Speed fan and says there's supposed to be a fourth one.

1788
02:02:52,223 --> 02:02:55,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a fourth secret one, but I don't know.

1789
02:02:55,346 --> 02:02:56,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully that's the good one.

1790
02:02:56,647 --> 02:02:57,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Need for Secret.

1791
02:02:58,889 --> 02:03:02,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Burnout Paradise Burnout Paradise Burnout Paradise

1792
02:03:26,083 --> 02:03:36,607
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a Burnout Paradise Police Cars, and they've got the actual link for it, but it says coming soon on the actual in-game store.

1793
02:03:37,507 --> 02:03:46,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And they do have some screenshots, I guess, I don't know if it's preview pics or something like that, of the PCPD cars.

1794
02:03:46,710 --> 02:03:50,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe new game modes, some sort of chasing stuff.

1795
02:03:51,525 --> 02:03:55,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Burnout Paradise is getting fucking awesome and now you can get the game for like 20 bucks.

1796
02:03:56,823 --> 02:04:00,045
[SPEAKER_06]: All the free download content and all the paid download content that's coming out.

1797
02:04:00,065 --> 02:04:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Much love to those folks for just continuing to support a game that might have gotten bashed as mediocre when it came out, but they're still just expanding and expanding on it and making it pretty awesome.

1798
02:04:10,572 --> 02:04:11,712
[SPEAKER_05]: So, good for you guys.

1799
02:04:14,234 --> 02:04:14,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1800
02:04:14,694 --> 02:04:17,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Any time frame on when that could come out?

1801
02:04:17,656 --> 02:04:21,118
[SPEAKER_06]: No word, but a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, like there's the Burnout Paradise...

1802
02:04:22,986 --> 02:04:23,687
[SPEAKER_06]: The New Cars.

1803
02:04:23,787 --> 02:04:25,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's coming out this week.

1804
02:04:26,248 --> 02:04:27,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably later on.

1805
02:04:27,429 --> 02:04:28,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe this month.

1806
02:04:28,489 --> 02:04:29,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly next.

1807
02:04:30,450 --> 02:04:31,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably relatively soon.

1808
02:04:32,852 --> 02:04:33,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1809
02:04:34,145 --> 02:04:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1810
02:04:54,807 --> 02:04:58,410
[SPEAKER_05]: One more story tonight, and it involves a company we talk about a lot on this show, PopCap.

1811
02:04:59,171 --> 02:05:02,474
[SPEAKER_05]: PopCap is finally bringing some of their games to the PlayStation Network.

1812
02:05:02,494 --> 02:05:03,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually happened this week.

1813
02:05:03,775 --> 02:05:13,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Bejeweled 2 finally showed up on the PlayStation Network, and there also are plans to release Zuma, Heavy Weapon, Feeding Frenzy, and Peggle.

1814
02:05:14,862 --> 02:05:16,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Peggle's pretty awesome.

1815
02:05:16,343 --> 02:05:21,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Peggle hasn't even showed up on Xbox Live yet, so I'm curious if it'll beat it to the punch on PlayStation 3.

1816
02:05:21,687 --> 02:05:22,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of doubt it.

1817
02:05:22,828 --> 02:05:24,389
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll probably be released simultaneously.

1818
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:26,110
[SPEAKER_05]: But there you go.

1819
02:05:27,672 --> 02:05:28,812
[SPEAKER_05]: $9.99 if you want to check out Bejeweled 2.

1820
02:05:29,053 --> 02:05:31,875
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one penny less than what you'll pay on Xbox Live.

1821
02:05:33,792 --> 02:05:35,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I go where the bargain ends.

1822
02:06:02,876 --> 02:06:05,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line now.

1823
02:06:05,259 --> 02:06:08,122
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the U.S.

1824
02:06:08,162 --> 02:06:08,622
[SPEAKER_05]: and Canada.

1825
02:06:08,823 --> 02:06:09,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can call us on Skype.

1826
02:06:09,984 --> 02:06:12,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.

1827
02:06:13,087 --> 02:06:17,933
[SPEAKER_05]: While we wait for some calls to come in, because we do have a little bit of a delay between when I say, hey, call in, and...

1828
02:06:19,076 --> 02:06:23,198
[SPEAKER_05]: When people actually hear me say that on the radio, Loki, do we have any last-minute stories tonight?

1829
02:06:23,578 --> 02:06:38,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, speaking of football, apparently there's that whole deal where the retired NFL players were not getting any money from the new NFL games, and their likenesses were being used without any sort of compensation.

1830
02:06:39,405 --> 02:06:46,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have now finished that whole lawsuit, and they are going to be getting paid out on it.

1831
02:06:47,409 --> 02:06:47,969
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

1832
02:06:48,049 --> 02:06:53,230
[SPEAKER_06]: In the tune of $28.1 million by the NFL.

1833
02:06:53,410 --> 02:06:54,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Only, let's go to the sky flying.

1834
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:56,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1835
02:06:56,271 --> 02:06:56,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1836
02:06:57,891 --> 02:06:59,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

1837
02:06:59,551 --> 02:07:01,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?

1838
02:07:03,732 --> 02:07:04,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, two things.

1839
02:07:05,452 --> 02:07:12,394
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I just want to double check and make sure I heard you correctly in part A. Did you see that he had...

1840
02:07:15,653 --> 02:07:21,965
[SPEAKER_00]: The collector's edition of Gears of War 2, you're going to lose your Golden Lancer.

1841
02:07:22,432 --> 02:07:29,374
[SPEAKER_05]: No, only if you were one of the people that downloaded it while I guess it accidentally went up on the marketplace for free and so a bunch of people downloaded it.

1842
02:07:29,694 --> 02:07:33,636
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to restrict it so that only the people with the collector's edition actually have it.

1843
02:07:33,676 --> 02:07:35,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how they're going to figure that out.

1844
02:07:35,276 --> 02:07:36,056
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to.

1845
02:07:36,137 --> 02:07:37,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to happen.

1846
02:07:37,057 --> 02:07:38,377
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think they'll actually be able to figure it out?

1847
02:07:38,397 --> 02:07:39,398
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're not going to figure it out.

1848
02:07:39,438 --> 02:07:41,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's convinced they're not going to be able to figure it out.

1849
02:07:41,178 --> 02:07:46,700
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you legitimately have the gold gun from the collector's edition, you're not who they're trying to remove it from.

1850
02:07:48,686 --> 02:07:56,848
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of glad about that because if I were one of the people that had bought the collector's edition, I'd just hate to lose my fee, you know?

1851
02:07:56,968 --> 02:07:57,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on.

1852
02:07:57,568 --> 02:07:59,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not much of a Gears player.

1853
02:07:59,348 --> 02:08:02,789
[SPEAKER_05]: What is so special about the gold gun, or is it just that it's pretty?

1854
02:08:02,809 --> 02:08:03,689
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a gold gun.

1855
02:08:06,329 --> 02:08:08,610
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just bragging rights more than anything.

1856
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:12,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to say, hey, I got the special edition.

1857
02:08:12,110 --> 02:08:16,911
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the Iron Rich application for the iPhones.

1858
02:08:17,313 --> 02:08:19,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I kind of thought maybe it fired gold bullets or something.

1859
02:08:19,714 --> 02:08:20,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, what was your second question?

1860
02:08:22,815 --> 02:08:27,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not so much a question, it's more like a stupid statement.

1861
02:08:28,237 --> 02:08:30,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we make a lot of those on this show, so go right ahead.

1862
02:08:32,119 --> 02:08:41,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just thinking, with all the talk about strippers in movies during Part A, I doubt it'll ever happen, but someone should make a

1863
02:08:42,621 --> 02:08:52,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Game for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 where you go up to a strip club and have boobies splash in your face.

1864
02:08:52,267 --> 02:08:56,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, I don't know, like Showgirls type of game.

1865
02:08:56,710 --> 02:08:58,051
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be called This is Vegas.

1866
02:08:58,611 --> 02:09:00,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out for Midway later this year.

1867
02:09:01,093 --> 02:09:01,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1868
02:09:01,833 --> 02:09:04,014
[SPEAKER_05]: What about that Playboy game that they had?

1869
02:09:04,054 --> 02:09:04,955
[SPEAKER_05]: The Playboy Mansion?

1870
02:09:05,235 --> 02:09:06,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was actually supposed to be pretty good.

1871
02:09:07,016 --> 02:09:07,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It was popular.

1872
02:09:07,597 --> 02:09:07,857
[SPEAKER_05]: You know...

1873
02:09:08,377 --> 02:09:20,447
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, a lot of these games, while you might see some boobs here and there, you're never going to see anything pretty much more hardcore than that on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 because of the whole standards thing.

1874
02:09:20,907 --> 02:09:26,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Where if your game gets rated adults only, your game can't come out on any of the consoles.

1875
02:09:26,872 --> 02:09:31,916
[SPEAKER_05]: The consoles basically forbid it because there's too many people out there who don't understand...

1876
02:09:32,476 --> 02:09:37,017
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a developer who makes for the publisher who puts that on the system.

1877
02:09:37,397 --> 02:09:46,179
[SPEAKER_05]: People think, oh, Nintendo Wii has got this disgusting vagina-eating game that's out on the system.

1878
02:09:46,399 --> 02:09:47,460
[SPEAKER_05]: When is that getting released?

1879
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, because it's rated adults only.

1880
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:53,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like it used to be back in the day.

1881
02:09:53,501 --> 02:09:55,281
[SPEAKER_05]: You get it on the Homebrew channel?

1882
02:09:55,321 --> 02:09:57,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That Nintendo seal of quality.

1883
02:09:57,982 --> 02:09:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1884
02:09:59,283 --> 02:10:03,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember how those other companies would put out their own games without going through Nintendo.

1885
02:10:03,969 --> 02:10:05,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of like a whole bootleg thing.

1886
02:10:05,051 --> 02:10:06,112
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't really do that now.

1887
02:10:07,013 --> 02:10:10,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, I don't think you're ever going to see real hardcore games get released.

1888
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:13,582
[SPEAKER_05]: You would wish one of them would just let up.

1889
02:10:14,451 --> 02:10:14,931
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1890
02:10:36,058 --> 02:10:46,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I don't know, porn on the internet's great, but I can see a lot of potential for the new Wiimote technology in a porno game.

1891
02:10:47,123 --> 02:10:47,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1892
02:10:48,004 --> 02:10:57,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially if the vagina-eating game was either pigs-in-a-trough type eating or knife-and-fork.

1893
02:10:57,108 --> 02:10:59,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee has a great name in chat for the game, Muff Chomp.

1894
02:11:01,230 --> 02:11:01,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1895
02:11:02,211 --> 02:11:02,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1896
02:11:03,183 --> 02:11:22,331
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, since you kind of touched on it earlier for a second, you know, now this is just me, you know, speaking out by yes here, but what I'm thinking is that, you know, console owners should be afraid of AO games, you know.

1897
02:11:22,531 --> 02:11:29,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, if you mean, like, there should be no problems with it, you know, it's kind of like, you know,

1898
02:11:29,881 --> 02:11:32,764
[SPEAKER_00]: The best analogy I can give you is with M-rated games.

1899
02:11:33,164 --> 02:11:36,727
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two out there that are complete opposites.

1900
02:11:36,787 --> 02:11:41,712
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Grand Theft Auto series and the BMX XXX.

1901
02:11:41,852 --> 02:11:46,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the Grand Theft Auto games are really great.

1902
02:11:47,317 --> 02:11:53,022
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few naysayers out there, whereas BMX XXX.

1903
02:11:56,091 --> 02:11:57,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta get BMX XXX again.

1904
02:11:57,773 --> 02:11:58,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that game.

1905
02:11:58,674 --> 02:12:01,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think my sister has it because I had it for the GameCube.

1906
02:12:01,418 --> 02:12:03,400
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is awesome.

1907
02:12:04,161 --> 02:12:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki really has the best family ever, doesn't he?

1908
02:12:07,525 --> 02:12:09,026
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she has my GameCube.

1909
02:12:09,067 --> 02:12:10,588
[SPEAKER_05]: The sister plays BMX XXX.

1910
02:12:11,209 --> 02:12:12,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a funny game!

1911
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:22,695
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seriously, it's Tony, it's not Tony Hawk, it's like Matt Hoffman's Probium X, but with like nudity and stuff, and just a ridiculous plotline, but it's basically like the old school Tony Hawk game.

1912
02:12:22,735 --> 02:12:30,599
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what though, Spazinator makes kind of a good point though, is that you know, we have, especially we have this whole duel thing in this country which stinks, this whole double standard where

1913
02:12:31,579 --> 02:12:35,861
[SPEAKER_05]: You could chop people in half and chop their heads off and have a completely violent game.

1914
02:12:36,002 --> 02:12:37,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's R or it's M-rated.

1915
02:12:37,562 --> 02:12:43,945
[SPEAKER_05]: But heaven forbid you show a cooter or a penis and it's going to be an NC-17 or AO-related thing.

1916
02:12:44,286 --> 02:12:52,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But he makes a good point that a lot of the sex games that we've had that have come out, like the guy game, BMX XXX, they've all been kind of crap.

1917
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:56,452
[SPEAKER_05]: What we need is a good artistic...

1918
02:12:57,772 --> 02:13:00,874
[SPEAKER_05]: and Pussy Eating came to come out.

1919
02:13:00,894 --> 02:13:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just needed to have, you know, a little bit of art.

1920
02:13:05,737 --> 02:13:08,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be like Master Pussy Theater.

1921
02:13:08,278 --> 02:13:10,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Master Pussy Theater, exactly.

1922
02:13:12,481 --> 02:13:25,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to really take it over the edge there, you know, throw all that stuff in there and then just, you know, have like a side mission where you blow up a certain ex-fluoridian lawyer.

1923
02:13:27,428 --> 02:13:27,868
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1924
02:13:27,888 --> 02:13:27,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1925
02:13:55,021 --> 02:13:59,085
[SPEAKER_05]: AcidicVampire wants to remind us there's boobies in God of War in a sex minigame.

1926
02:13:59,105 --> 02:14:00,046
[SPEAKER_10]: There is.

1927
02:14:01,207 --> 02:14:02,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Boobie Lounge Radio.

1928
02:14:02,548 --> 02:14:02,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1929
02:14:04,190 --> 02:14:05,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Boobie Lounge Radio.

1930
02:14:05,411 --> 02:14:06,252
[SPEAKER_04]: How exciting.

1931
02:14:06,412 --> 02:14:07,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa.

1932
02:14:07,073 --> 02:14:07,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, guys.

1933
02:14:07,953 --> 02:14:08,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Jason.

1934
02:14:08,574 --> 02:14:09,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Jason.

1935
02:14:09,094 --> 02:14:09,395
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

1936
02:14:09,435 --> 02:14:09,955
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1937
02:14:11,096 --> 02:14:15,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now that you mention it, I don't know that I want to explain on air what's on my mind.

1938
02:14:16,485 --> 02:14:20,549
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you call in to discuss tonight with the Orange Launch Radio host on this family program?

1939
02:14:20,589 --> 02:14:27,516
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly are alive and spewing their shit, your dreams will never come true, I'm sorry to say.

1940
02:14:27,916 --> 02:14:29,678
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not why I called in, but it was very funny.

1941
02:14:29,698 --> 02:14:33,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very funny anecdote to add in to everything that just happened.

1942
02:14:35,124 --> 02:14:36,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping somebody can answer me this because...

1943
02:14:37,952 --> 02:14:41,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I heard this just recently, and it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

1944
02:14:42,294 --> 02:14:45,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does Gears of War need SSL, and why does it stop the game from working?

1945
02:14:45,896 --> 02:14:48,177
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole Gears of War broken, blah blah blah.

1946
02:14:49,797 --> 02:14:51,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know the technical reason behind that?

1947
02:14:51,918 --> 02:14:53,699
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because the certificate expired.

1948
02:14:54,740 --> 02:14:57,481
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the certificate actually used for?

1949
02:14:58,161 --> 02:14:58,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

1950
02:15:00,882 --> 02:15:03,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And it blocks the game in its entirety?

1951
02:15:03,504 --> 02:15:03,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure.

1952
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:05,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1953
02:15:06,531 --> 02:15:11,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't play Gears of War on PC and it's such an easy fix to set my date back.

1954
02:15:12,315 --> 02:15:17,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it some type of thing to prevent cheating or the connection to multiplayer mode is secure?

1955
02:15:17,218 --> 02:15:20,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe to authenticate that it's a legit copy of the game?

1956
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:21,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be something like that.

1957
02:15:21,261 --> 02:15:23,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Authenticating the legitimacy of the game or something like that.

1958
02:15:23,922 --> 02:15:24,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1959
02:15:24,543 --> 02:15:30,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it has a direct impact on the game itself, Jason, or I think the 360 ones would have stopped working too.

1960
02:15:30,707 --> 02:15:35,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it has specifically to do with some type of authentication thing on the PC.

1961
02:15:35,771 --> 02:15:36,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.

1962
02:15:36,913 --> 02:15:38,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Some kind of a phone home connection, something or other.

1963
02:15:39,077 --> 02:15:42,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

1964
02:15:42,884 --> 02:15:47,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've heard of some really stupid DRM, but for crying out loud, people.

1965
02:15:50,265 --> 02:15:51,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's laughable.

1966
02:15:51,145 --> 02:15:55,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You put the situation where you have to have a patch.

1967
02:15:55,629 --> 02:15:57,350
[SPEAKER_04]: One of two things has to happen.

1968
02:15:57,370 --> 02:16:05,496
[SPEAKER_04]: You either have to buy a ridiculously expensive certificate for, I don't know, 10 years, and then you piss off all the nostalgia players.

1969
02:16:06,136 --> 02:16:11,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you have to issue a patch every single year with a new certificate.

1970
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:16,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think this is going to be a tough lesson learned because this is a pretty big fuck up to have your game completely stop working.

1971
02:16:16,727 --> 02:16:17,207
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bad setup.

1972
02:16:17,248 --> 02:16:19,190
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to get rid of that entirely.

1973
02:16:19,871 --> 02:16:22,454
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a bad mechanism.

1974
02:16:22,634 --> 02:16:24,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, enough computer geekery.

1975
02:16:25,999 --> 02:16:27,601
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys mentioned that and I just kind of...

1976
02:16:27,941 --> 02:16:31,905
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been having trouble with this sort of thing way back from Monkey Island.

1977
02:16:31,945 --> 02:16:33,726
[SPEAKER_07]: They have yet to get this right.

1978
02:16:34,447 --> 02:16:43,575
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remember way back on the really old DOS games, you used to buy a game and it'd come with a little booklet and at certain times you'd have to refer to page 193, line B.

1979
02:16:47,277 --> 02:17:14,763
[SPEAKER_04]: or you'd have some awful little card you have to match up with the moon on the solstice of winter just to prove that you did in fact buy the game and if you lose it you're fucked some of those things weren't so bad and with the internet I've had a lot of things be subtly replaced anyways Space Quest the Space Quest series came with a brochure of sorts to explain about the game and it had

1980
02:17:15,203 --> 02:17:23,150
[SPEAKER_04]: In the case of Space Quest V, which was one of my favorite ones, it had like a star chart with constellation codes or something like that.

1981
02:17:23,450 --> 02:17:29,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had to use those codes to actually warp to different locales in the game as the story tells you to go there.

1982
02:17:29,996 --> 02:17:32,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was their DRM, and it was good.

1983
02:17:32,197 --> 02:17:32,898
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cute.

1984
02:17:33,078 --> 02:17:36,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, what I didn't like about that whole thing is that then console games started doing it.

1985
02:17:37,022 --> 02:17:41,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know, if I didn't have that letter from home to dip in the water to see the secret code...

1986
02:17:43,369 --> 02:17:51,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have that letter because I bought my game used and I had to call their helpline I'm like, uh, they'll dip the letter in the water I'm like, what letter?

1987
02:17:52,016 --> 02:17:58,801
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the one in the manual I don't have the manual Okay, the code's 747 Well, was it that hard?

1988
02:17:59,102 --> 02:18:04,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't you just tell me that the first thing or do you not get your 99 cents a minute if you give it away that fast?

1989
02:18:05,787 --> 02:18:10,511
[SPEAKER_04]: People will say that DRM is a necessary evil I'll tell that person you're full of shit

1990
02:18:11,109 --> 02:18:16,273
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Space Quest V... It's self-serving and it only serves to fuck people over.

1991
02:18:16,533 --> 02:18:22,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, Nathan wanted to say something about Space Quest V. Did you also enjoy blowing up an android with a banana?

1992
02:18:22,917 --> 02:18:23,778
[SPEAKER_07]: A space banana?

1993
02:18:24,518 --> 02:18:31,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That was... When I was a lot younger, the BBSs were around, but that was the extent of my online life.

1994
02:18:31,663 --> 02:18:32,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Space Quest IV.

1995
02:18:32,484 --> 02:18:33,985
[SPEAKER_04]: That was as far as I could get.

1996
02:18:34,125 --> 02:18:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I never got to the R&R world.

1997
02:18:36,827 --> 02:18:39,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So as many times as I played the game, I always...

1998
02:18:41,264 --> 02:18:43,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't even remember what that planet is called anymore.

1999
02:18:43,907 --> 02:18:45,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I always got that far, and then that was the end of it.

2000
02:18:46,350 --> 02:18:49,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the whole game for me for about five years of my life.

2001
02:18:49,394 --> 02:18:54,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I was more of a King's Quest player, and I wish to God those games would come out on Xbox Live Arcade.

2002
02:18:54,179 --> 02:18:56,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Although they're on GameTap and stuff, so you know.

2003
02:18:56,582 --> 02:18:59,025
[SPEAKER_04]: You're entirely wrong in your preference, but you know what?

2004
02:18:59,065 --> 02:18:59,846
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people were.

2005
02:19:01,896 --> 02:19:03,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, King's Quest has that rabid fandom.

2006
02:19:03,837 --> 02:19:15,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember about a year or two ago on this show, we had those guys do a silver lining, which was originally like a King's Quest-inspired thing, and then they were allowed to put it out if they ditched the King's Quest thing, and that whole mess that was going on there.

2007
02:19:16,424 --> 02:19:18,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say anything bad about King's Quest this year.

2008
02:19:18,905 --> 02:19:20,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Adventure games in general were really impressive.

2009
02:19:20,806 --> 02:19:22,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I just never had one.

2010
02:19:22,307 --> 02:19:22,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I never played one.

2011
02:19:23,087 --> 02:19:23,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Quest wasn't my series.

2012
02:19:23,807 --> 02:19:28,530
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something sadly lacking in gaming today, unless it says Telltale Games on it.

2013
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:30,691
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the only ones doing anything, you know?

2014
02:19:32,455 --> 02:19:35,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, anything else, Jason, you want to talk about tonight before we get some other calls?

2015
02:19:35,976 --> 02:19:40,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys really think that Bioshock really needs multiplayer?

2016
02:19:41,298 --> 02:19:41,578
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2017
02:19:41,938 --> 02:19:43,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally don't think it needs multiplayer.

2018
02:19:44,019 --> 02:19:45,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the first one was good enough as it is.

2019
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can see why they want to put it in the second one to definitely make it not feel like more of the same.

2020
02:19:52,182 --> 02:19:56,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, I think otherwise some people might start to say, well, it's more of the same.

2021
02:19:56,504 --> 02:19:56,904
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's...

2022
02:19:57,404 --> 02:19:58,485
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another sci-fi.

2023
02:19:58,525 --> 02:20:02,508
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what the story is or what they do with it, there's going to be people out there that say it's more of the same.

2024
02:20:02,808 --> 02:20:08,272
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they throw this multiplayer curve at it, people are going to be like, oh my gosh, it's like the must-have game of da-da-da.

2025
02:20:08,752 --> 02:20:09,933
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost makes me think they left it out.

2026
02:20:09,953 --> 02:20:12,575
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it just like every other first-person shooter with a different weapon set.

2027
02:20:14,006 --> 02:20:22,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I mean, the one thing, as much crap as I gave Bioshock, because the ending, the last hour and a half or so of it just absolutely pissed me off.

2028
02:20:22,431 --> 02:20:27,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so boring, and then it ended with the easiest boss battle I think I've ever seen in a game.

2029
02:20:30,235 --> 02:20:35,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Bioshock, what made, the best thing about Bioshock was the story.

2030
02:20:35,438 --> 02:20:40,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting, it was scientific fantasy, sci-fi, and

2031
02:20:41,658 --> 02:20:43,419
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a good story.

2032
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:55,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to find the story, and if you actually sat down and paid attention to it... I mean, I'm not an ADD gamer, so maybe I have a little bit of a different look on the game than some other people.

2033
02:20:55,806 --> 02:21:00,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But the story made that game incredible until the end.

2034
02:21:01,028 --> 02:21:02,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was the best part about it.

2035
02:21:02,409 --> 02:21:04,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And you lose all that in multiplayer.

2036
02:21:04,350 --> 02:21:05,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more...

2037
02:21:06,289 --> 02:21:08,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I really shouldn't say this, but it's more humdrum.

2038
02:21:08,271 --> 02:21:11,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't necessarily mean, though, Jason, that the focus is going to be on multiplayer.

2039
02:21:11,814 --> 02:21:16,599
[SPEAKER_05]: They might still have a very solid single-player mode in it, and the multiplayer might just be an afterthought type thing.

2040
02:21:17,240 --> 02:21:18,801
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true.

2041
02:21:18,941 --> 02:21:26,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... A lot of... When you guys mentioned it, and I went article surfing, it was just like, they're finally getting multiplayer!

2042
02:21:26,228 --> 02:21:27,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

2043
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:27,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

2044
02:21:28,491 --> 02:21:29,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2045
02:21:29,412 --> 02:21:34,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because there's a whole audience out there that does play first-person shooters to do the multiplayer.

2046
02:21:34,739 --> 02:21:37,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it was missing for them in the first Bioshock.

2047
02:21:37,142 --> 02:21:38,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they don't see the same thing in it.

2048
02:21:38,424 --> 02:21:38,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't knock it.

2049
02:21:39,005 --> 02:21:42,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of... It seems overbearing in the pre... Yeah.

2050
02:21:44,767 --> 02:21:45,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2051
02:21:45,367 --> 02:21:47,429
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Jason, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2052
02:21:47,449 --> 02:21:48,029
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have a good one.

2053
02:21:48,149 --> 02:21:48,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, buddy.

2054
02:21:48,669 --> 02:21:49,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

2055
02:21:49,089 --> 02:21:51,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, come on.

2056
02:21:51,531 --> 02:21:53,652
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to keep it to five minutes, and you're on eight.

2057
02:21:54,092 --> 02:21:54,332
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2058
02:21:55,273 --> 02:21:55,733
[SPEAKER_05]: See you, buddy.

2059
02:21:56,213 --> 02:21:56,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2060
02:21:56,694 --> 02:21:56,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2061
02:21:57,974 --> 02:22:00,396
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2062
02:22:00,496 --> 02:22:02,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2063
02:22:03,257 --> 02:22:06,779
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, apparently not having multiplayer in a game hurts a game.

2064
02:22:07,139 --> 02:22:09,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry if Legend of Zelda doesn't have multiplayer.

2065
02:22:09,441 --> 02:22:11,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, but there was that Four Swords game.

2066
02:22:11,122 --> 02:22:12,242
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of awesome.

2067
02:22:12,262 --> 02:22:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that on the GameCube?

2068
02:22:14,405 --> 02:22:15,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that game.

2069
02:22:15,286 --> 02:22:16,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2070
02:22:16,366 --> 02:22:16,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2071
02:22:19,008 --> 02:22:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: It's GS68.

2072
02:22:20,208 --> 02:22:20,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, GS68.

2073
02:22:21,249 --> 02:22:21,809
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

2074
02:22:23,951 --> 02:22:25,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found out I'm playing DJ Maxx Fever.

2075
02:22:26,732 --> 02:22:28,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the new one in the U.S., the one that just came out?

2076
02:22:29,794 --> 02:22:30,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the American one.

2077
02:22:31,355 --> 02:22:32,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you're a big...

2078
02:22:39,446 --> 02:22:42,691
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're already into the series, I can't really recommend it.

2079
02:22:42,771 --> 02:22:47,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you might as well just get Portable 1 and 2 and get the full silence from both games.

2080
02:22:48,920 --> 02:23:01,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of interested in your review here, because I know you're a big DJ Maxx fan, so it's kind of interesting to hear you give this a negative review, but what if I'm somebody, because I am somebody, personally, who's not really played a lot of the DJ Maxx game.

2081
02:23:02,007 --> 02:23:08,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend that's obsessed with it too, so I've seen it, I've seen a couple of the videos, I've not really sat down and spent any quality time with the game.

2082
02:23:09,331 --> 02:23:13,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say I'm a person who's never really seen or heard of DJ Maxx before, is this a good introduction game?

2083
02:23:16,295 --> 02:23:16,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

2084
02:23:17,918 --> 02:23:18,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really say.

2085
02:23:18,759 --> 02:23:26,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played much, but... It's pretty decent, but there's one thing that's bugging me about this game, and it's the whole autocorrect feature.

2086
02:23:29,166 --> 02:23:29,946
[SPEAKER_05]: What is this feature?

2087
02:23:31,987 --> 02:23:45,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, if you press the wrong button for a node, but at the right time, if all is on the same side of the screen as the node is, you still get the full percentage for it, and you still get some points for it.

2088
02:23:45,997 --> 02:23:46,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

2089
02:23:46,929 --> 02:23:53,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a GameFAQ with DJ Max Feverboard and I'm seeing newbies saying, oh, so you can just press any button to play the game?

2090
02:23:53,394 --> 02:23:54,835
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the point of the notes and such?

2091
02:23:55,015 --> 02:23:57,497
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I think this thing is a bad idea.

2092
02:23:58,318 --> 02:23:59,919
[SPEAKER_05]: That is kind of strange.

2093
02:23:59,939 --> 02:24:02,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because then you can just go like, do, do, do, do.

2094
02:24:02,841 --> 02:24:03,722
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't turn that off?

2095
02:24:03,842 --> 02:24:06,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems a little silly.

2096
02:24:06,744 --> 02:24:16,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, you get 80% of the points, but you still get full credit as far as your percentage goes, which means you can go on pressing the wrong notes at

2097
02:24:17,362 --> 02:24:18,351
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time I still get 100%

2098
02:24:20,543 --> 02:24:21,784
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage at the end of the song.

2099
02:24:51,156 --> 02:25:04,120
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not as bad as they say, but and groovy.

2100
02:25:05,820 --> 02:25:16,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is pretty good for a release on its own, but when you compare it to the other releases, it feels kind of outdated, and there's only one or two exclusive songs, and they're not that good.

2101
02:25:17,958 --> 02:25:19,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's unfortunate, I guess.

2102
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:20,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

2103
02:25:20,780 --> 02:25:23,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if it sells okay, they'll do another one.

2104
02:25:24,003 --> 02:25:24,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not.

2105
02:25:25,444 --> 02:25:26,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a few licenses would have hurt.

2106
02:25:27,005 --> 02:25:30,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hey, they did Classic Edition, which is a licensed game.

2107
02:25:32,689 --> 02:25:33,069
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

2108
02:25:35,151 --> 02:25:39,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, kind of saying that, yeah, maybe a few licenses wouldn't have hurt the game.

2109
02:25:39,354 --> 02:25:43,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Digimix Portal Classic Edition is licensed.

2110
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:45,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

2111
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:52,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I was saying that last week on the show, it just needed a little bit of Americanization to help it penetrate the market, even though it might have pissed some of the hardcore fans off.

2112
02:25:52,993 --> 02:25:56,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have, in the long run, benefited the game because it would have sold more copies, but nope.

2113
02:25:56,894 --> 02:25:57,335
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I know?

2114
02:25:58,635 --> 02:26:00,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anything else on your mind, GS68?

2115
02:26:03,657 --> 02:26:04,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much, really, I guess.

2116
02:26:05,018 --> 02:26:07,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Poppin' Music 13, but eh.

2117
02:26:08,999 --> 02:26:11,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, I was going to say this, but

2118
02:26:11,818 --> 02:26:16,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Maximum 2 and 3 DX came out, but I don't want to talk about it because no one cares about it.

2119
02:26:16,742 --> 02:26:17,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that great?

2120
02:26:19,905 --> 02:26:26,471
[SPEAKER_01]: It just adds a new course and has 20 more stages and that's about it, basically.

2121
02:26:27,552 --> 02:26:32,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, if fans of the series then should keep an eye out for that for more stages and all that good stuff.

2122
02:26:33,057 --> 02:26:34,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, GSX-8, have a good one, buddy.

2123
02:26:36,112 --> 02:26:36,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, you too.

2124
02:26:37,233 --> 02:26:37,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2125
02:26:38,133 --> 02:26:43,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Our resident DJ Max fan calling in to give us the update on what's going on there.

2126
02:26:44,918 --> 02:26:52,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line for now, so sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, but we will always open it up again next week to take more of your phone calls.

2127
02:26:52,603 --> 02:26:54,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to go around and start to wrap up the show.

2128
02:26:55,124 --> 02:27:00,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been kind of a quick show tonight, but you know, there wasn't a whole lot in the gaming news, and of course with the Super Bowl and everything else going on.

2129
02:27:01,488 --> 02:27:03,890
[SPEAKER_05]: At least you got stripper talk, if nothing else, tonight.

2130
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:05,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was a good show.

2131
02:27:05,491 --> 02:27:05,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I had

2132
02:27:06,493 --> 02:27:07,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have fun, Rice Princess?

2133
02:27:08,096 --> 02:27:09,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a great time.

2134
02:27:09,699 --> 02:27:11,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you so much for being here.

2135
02:27:11,041 --> 02:27:12,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2136
02:27:13,566 --> 02:27:14,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Resident Evil 5.

2137
02:27:15,137 --> 02:27:15,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil 5.

2138
02:27:15,957 --> 02:27:19,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I should go to Loki though first and ask if there's any last minute stories or he'll yell at me.

2139
02:27:20,339 --> 02:27:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to yell at you.

2140
02:27:21,299 --> 02:27:22,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care.

2141
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:24,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

2142
02:27:25,361 --> 02:27:27,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, there's a couple things real quick.

2143
02:27:28,242 --> 02:27:32,524
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a launch date 360, it's no longer under warranty.

2144
02:27:33,104 --> 02:27:39,806
[SPEAKER_06]: As of February 2nd, year 360, if it gets the three rings of death, you're screwed.

2145
02:27:40,306 --> 02:27:42,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've got to pay $99 to get the unit fixed.

2146
02:27:43,748 --> 02:27:43,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Or...

2147
02:27:44,548 --> 02:28:13,120
[SPEAKER_07]: just buy a new one you know or you can just pay someone else to fix it for you for probably less if you pay the $99 to get it fixed is it a new warranty or do you have to pay $99 if it breaks the next day I think it's a one year warranty after that if mine red rings of death again although I didn't get mine I mean I would still be covered I think for a couple more months I'm not sure actually

2148
02:28:13,578 --> 02:28:14,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2149
02:28:29,878 --> 02:28:53,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Pluckly I think all mine have crapped out the ones that were going to crap out I have one left that's of my original and I have my other one that I fixed so the one that fixes is actually still working very well and then I have one more that like I said that hasn't been replaced yet but all the other ones have so you know four out of six is not a good good ratio no anything else last minute stories tonight

2150
02:28:55,780 --> 02:28:56,220
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2151
02:28:56,761 --> 02:29:00,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, then Silent Nathan, thank you for being here and being so quiet.

2152
02:29:00,083 --> 02:29:02,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2153
02:29:03,486 --> 02:29:07,669
[SPEAKER_07]: You're gonna want to stick with lanolin and not that aloe vera bullshit.

2154
02:29:09,310 --> 02:29:09,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2155
02:29:12,152 --> 02:29:15,635
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought for tonight is vitamin water is awesome.

2156
02:29:16,275 --> 02:29:17,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, do you have any final thoughts tonight?

2157
02:29:20,438 --> 02:29:20,999
[SPEAKER_05]: My head hurts.

2158
02:29:21,819 --> 02:29:22,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, Loki.

2159
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:24,061
