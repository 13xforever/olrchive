00:00.000 --> 00:21.240
Today, February 1, 2009, could Wii photo printing come to the US, Gears of War PC breaks down,

00:21.240 --> 00:32.360
and multiplayer comes to the next Bioshock game.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.360
What football game?

00:33.360 --> 00:36.360
Hey, welcome everybody to another week of Orange Launch Radio.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.520
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:41.520 --> 00:43.320
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.320 --> 00:49.360
And we are always here every week to talk to you guys live on All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.320
Joining me for the next few hours, my name is Rob Roberts.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.220
Not joining us tonight is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.560
She is on a little vacation, I don't know if you'd call it a vacation.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.520
I think she had family stuff going on up in the lovely state of Washington, but not the

01:02.520 --> 01:07.040
parts like Seattle, Tacoma, like where PAX happens, and the part we were all at just

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
a little bit last year.

01:08.040 --> 01:13.600
She's in some town called Prosser, which I think is not quite as exciting as Seattle.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.920
So yeah, she's been updating her Twitter.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.960
If you follow DarkSaga on Twitter, she's been updating her Twitter pretty regularly.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.400
It's basically the equivalent of help me, please send help.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.080
I miss Wi-Fi.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.080
Help me.

01:26.080 --> 01:29.840
So joining us tonight, we have a different female perspective.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.080
Say hello to the one and only Rice Princess.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.080
Hello.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.080
How are you doing, Rice Princess?

01:35.080 --> 01:36.120
Oh, I'm all right.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.120
How about you?

01:37.120 --> 01:38.120
Not bad, not bad.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.600
Are you caring about the Super Bowl that's going on right now as we're doing the show?

01:41.600 --> 01:44.880
No, but I'm caring about Resident Evil 5.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.400
Rice Princess just found out that I actually downloaded the Resident Evil 5 demo and she's

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
dying to play.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.640
Are you a big Resident Evil fan?

01:50.640 --> 01:51.840
I am.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.840
How big?

01:53.840 --> 01:56.800
I've played all of the games.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
Even four and one, all of them?

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
Yeah.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.720
And if I were like a billionaire, I'd recreate the mansion.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
How about the movies?

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
Are you a big fan of the movies?

02:06.720 --> 02:08.080
I actually do like the movies too.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.080
Yeah.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.080
They're awesome.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.680
I heard some rumor, I don't think it made the show well tonight, some rumor there's

02:11.680 --> 02:14.760
a fourth one that's going to be made pretty soon.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.800
Do you think it should keep going or do you think they need to pull the plug now?

02:17.800 --> 02:20.960
It depends on where they take the story.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.920
If they're keep, I don't know, like because this last one that they came out with was

02:23.920 --> 02:28.580
an original story and it was just, I don't know, it was all right.

02:28.580 --> 02:31.560
If they go back to like the game story stuff, that'd be cool.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.560
All right.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.560
We'll also say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
Hello.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.560
How you doing, Loki?

02:36.560 --> 02:40.480
Fine, I'm trying to find the Transformers 2 trailer and apparently the link that we

02:40.480 --> 02:44.640
had in our chat room, it's not working or at least it works, but it's not playing.

02:44.640 --> 02:48.880
I see the real reason why people watch the Super Bowl, the commercials and the movie

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
trailers.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.680
You know, the smart people would realize that you can actually watch commercials before

02:52.680 --> 02:58.560
they come out on the Super Bowl, or at least for most of the trailers and, well not trailers

02:58.560 --> 02:59.560
but commercials.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.920
They actually have a website that had some, I was watching them earlier.

03:02.920 --> 03:03.920
They suck.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.680
Well, some of them suck, but most of them were not good.

03:07.680 --> 03:12.560
Well, also joining us every week is the ever present fourth guest on the show, the chat

03:12.560 --> 03:17.440
room and we have a acidic vampire in chat making a comment about Resident Evil.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.400
Degeneration was better than the live action movies, although extinction was okay.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.360
I really did like every regeneration.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.920
I do want to give a special shout out to the chatters tonight because they are here during

03:26.920 --> 03:31.880
the Super Bowl and so, you know, they're either football haters or they are very loyal listeners

03:31.880 --> 03:32.880
of Orange Lawn Radio.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.800
We only have probably about, you know, there was no Bobby tonight to lead into our show.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.840
He took the night off for the Super Bowl and we probably only have, between everything

03:39.840 --> 03:42.800
that's been going on, probably about a third of the usual listeners we have.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.560
So I want to really thank those folks that were loyal and stay in tune tonight.

03:46.560 --> 03:52.440
I also want to thank, joining us tonight in studio, say hello to Silent Nathan is here

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
again.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.440
Hello.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
Hello.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.000
No, seriously, how are you Nathan?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
How are you doing?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm fine.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.160
I have a motorcycle.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.760
You have a motorcycle?

04:01.760 --> 04:02.960
What game do you have a motorcycle in?

04:02.960 --> 04:04.720
Because I know you don't have one for real.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.040
Because I would have wanted to ride in the sidecar.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.040
World of Warcraft.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.040
Nerd.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.640
No, I'm just kidding.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.080
Describe to the listeners what having a motorcycle means in World of Warcraft and how exactly

04:16.080 --> 04:17.940
does it fit into the lore?

04:17.940 --> 04:26.080
It goes vroom, vroom, vroom, and then you can make it jump and it's lore-wise...

04:26.080 --> 04:29.680
Who cares?

04:29.680 --> 04:34.200
It's a motorcycle.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.000
How hard is it to get a motorcycle in the game?

04:38.000 --> 04:42.480
It's not hard, it's expensive.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.480
Just expensive.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.480
Did you have to do a lot of quests?

04:44.480 --> 04:48.400
Did you have to save a lot of princesses and storm a lot of castles?

04:48.400 --> 04:54.400
I'm hoarded so I usually have to kill the princesses and destroy the castles, but yeah,

04:54.400 --> 04:59.880
it's at least 12,000 gold just for vendor mats, so it's a lot of money.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.240
Well congratulations on your motorcycle.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.040
One day I will come back to WoW and I will ride in your motorcycle in the sidecar.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.080
It'll be fun.

05:07.080 --> 05:11.480
You have to come back within a month, otherwise you can't.

05:11.480 --> 05:15.240
But if I stay away for three months, then somebody can use the Scroll of Resurrection

05:15.240 --> 05:18.480
on me, and that's the whole plan, actually.

05:18.480 --> 05:24.640
You should actually cancel your account, start a whole new account, and we can be the leveling

05:24.640 --> 05:27.080
buddies and we'll get awesome mounts.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.040
There you go.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.480
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks in a segment we always like to start off the

05:34.480 --> 05:36.720
show with called How Is Your Gaming Week?

05:36.720 --> 05:37.880
But Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.440
How is your gaming week?

05:39.440 --> 05:43.740
It was still not that eventful, but more eventful than last week.

05:43.740 --> 05:50.360
More Grand Theft Auto 4 on Xbox 360, still playing stuff, which is, you know, it's fun.

05:50.360 --> 05:57.520
I'm looking forward to the new expansion they have coming out in I think a week or so.

05:57.520 --> 06:03.440
And then, let's see, I tried a little bit more Fable 2, went and downloaded the expansion

06:03.440 --> 06:04.440
for that.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.480
I haven't got a chance to play that yet, but I went and ran around a little bit and killed

06:08.480 --> 06:09.480
a few things.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.960
I don't know, Fable 2 is kind of okay for me.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.640
Why I decided to download the expansion when it's just okay is beyond me.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.360
I was like, I'm gonna do that.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
Wait a second.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.880
Because you're a consumer whore.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.080
But whatever, it's all good.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.280
So I'll probably, I'm trying to get back into that.

06:26.280 --> 06:32.880
And then finally, you know, after trying everything to get Grand Theft Auto 4 to work, I had to

06:32.880 --> 06:38.400
go back and do a system restore before it broke, and hooray, it works again!

06:38.400 --> 06:43.240
After I had to do some more futzing around with it because, you know, I got a different

06:43.240 --> 06:47.080
error message this time, but at least that was fixable, so.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.660
It works again, but the question is, for how long?

06:49.660 --> 06:52.920
So I'm excited about that because now I get to play with the mods again.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.960
You went on such a tangent last week.

06:54.960 --> 06:59.520
Oh, I'm still very disappointed with him because the fact that I have to patch.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.240
They released some patch this week, right?

07:01.240 --> 07:05.880
It did nothing to fix my problem.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.160
And you know, I hear it's causing more problems, so whatever.

07:09.160 --> 07:14.800
You want to hear something funny, and this isn't even on our show roll, apparently there

07:14.800 --> 07:24.320
is issues with Secure ROM's CD activation or authentication thing that they have running.

07:24.320 --> 07:29.040
So somebody had asked them, they had some problems, and Secure ROM just linked them

07:29.040 --> 07:35.400
to a program that bypasses the CD check, or the DVD check.

07:35.400 --> 07:39.160
So which, of course, that person posted that everywhere on the internet.

07:39.160 --> 07:47.400
So now there is literally an official no DVD patch for the game.

07:47.400 --> 07:52.680
So they've made it, you know, pretty easy to pirate the game, I guess.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.840
Well, technically you're not supposed to be able to pirate it because you still have to

07:55.840 --> 08:00.080
authenticate it and the serial number and everything like that to play online.

08:00.080 --> 08:05.560
But trust me, you don't really have to because it's able to be done.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.640
But now it doesn't check for the DVD.

08:07.640 --> 08:12.400
So that might solve some problems, at least some people are having.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.320
But yeah, I don't know, I'm interested to play the game a little bit more now.

08:17.320 --> 08:25.520
Also since I believe this add-on is exclusive for the Xbox 360, however people have found

08:25.520 --> 08:30.400
the models and stuff hidden within the code data or whatever.

08:30.400 --> 08:36.320
So I'll be seeing how they're going to modify stuff for the PC version.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.200
I don't know, PC version is this fun.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.200
All the mod stuff.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.360
Alright, so nuclear grenades, it sounds like you've warmed up a little bit to the PC one

08:42.360 --> 08:43.360
as opposed to last week.

08:43.360 --> 08:47.200
No, I still hate the way that they, no listen, I've warmed up to the fact that I can mod

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
it.

08:48.200 --> 08:53.480
I am not giving them any, you know, gimmes on the fact that it's just a really poor port

08:53.480 --> 08:56.800
whatsoever and the fact, the way they handled everything.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.000
There is no reason I should have to do a system restore to get a game to work.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.360
That's absolutely ridiculous.

09:02.360 --> 09:06.120
Because that screws up a bunch of other stuff on my computer, so I have to hopefully make

09:06.120 --> 09:07.920
sure everything's working now.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.000
But it's absolutely ridiculous that I would have to do a system restore to get a game

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
to work.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.120
Any game.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.640
Even Crysis, I had less trouble running.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.520
And goddamn Crysis is a bitch to, you know, work.

09:19.520 --> 09:24.480
And sadly enough, Crysis actually runs better than Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's telling

09:24.480 --> 09:25.480
you something.

09:25.480 --> 09:30.480
And trust me, Grand Theft Auto IV is not Crysis, is definitely not pushing the graphics that

09:30.480 --> 09:31.480
Crysis was.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.720
I think Acidic Vampire in chat sums it up very well.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.400
It's a love-hate relationship for Loki.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.440
It is a love-hate relationship.

09:37.440 --> 09:40.120
You love to hate it.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.120
Anything else for your gaming week?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.280
No, that was pretty much it.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.240
I have to ask for our spin-off show, Orange Lounge Foodio.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.560
You're pretty excited about the food you brought to the show tonight.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.520
Can you tell our listeners about this fine new cuisine of yours?

09:53.520 --> 09:57.920
It's not a fine cuisine, but they have these new things at Burger King called Burger Shots,

09:57.920 --> 10:00.200
and they're basically...

10:00.200 --> 10:04.040
Like when you first said the name, I was like, what popped in my head were like the dessert

10:04.040 --> 10:05.720
shots from Applebee's and stuff.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.160
I'm like, ew, that does not sound appetizing at all.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.800
Putting a hamburger in a glass, nasty.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.960
Putting hamburger and ketchup and mustard in a shot glass, that's disgusting.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
No, they're sliders.

10:16.960 --> 10:20.640
They're little mini hamburgers, basically, and you can buy them.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.800
They have a two-pack and a six-pack.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.800
Why would you want a two-pack?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.600
You don't want to get fat?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
I don't know.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.600
They're okay.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.480
They're all right.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.680
This is the second time I've had them, and it's just kind of okay now.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.360
It's not as good as their normal burgers.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.920
You don't have the smoky, flame-broiled taste to it, but they're okay.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.920
They're kind of neat.

10:42.920 --> 10:47.120
Isn't it the same thing they used to have years ago, but they were called burger buddies?

10:47.120 --> 10:48.120
I don't remember that.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.120
It was like 15 years ago.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.840
This is when I was a kid.

10:50.840 --> 10:51.840
Burger buddies?

10:51.840 --> 10:52.840
Yeah, something like that.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.160
Like, did you play with them?

10:54.160 --> 10:56.680
No, they were little, tiny, miniature hamburgers.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.680
I remember that.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.680
I used to love them.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.160
Could I have some burger buddies, please?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.080
Shut up, Rice Princess.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.480
Tell us about your gaming week.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.480
Back to gaming.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
Rice Princess.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.480
Okay.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.560
Well, I'm going to play the demo of Resident Evil 5, and that's going to be my gaming

11:10.560 --> 11:11.560
week.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.560
Yay.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.560
I'm going to play.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.560
Yeah, very much.

11:14.560 --> 11:18.880
I might turn around, and then suddenly Rice Princess is gone, and so is my Xbox 360.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.800
Or your PS3, because I wouldn't...

11:20.800 --> 11:23.000
I don't think they have the demo on PlayStation 3, actually.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Wait, what?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.400
I thought it was on your PS3.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.560
No, it's on my Xbox 360.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.560
I don't think they released a demo on PS3.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.040
I hate you, but I love Resident Evil.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.520
It was exclusive on the 360 for a week.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
Damn it.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.520
Okay.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.440
Well, that means if you want to wait until next week, they'll have it on PlayStation

11:39.440 --> 11:40.440
3.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.680
It's exactly the same game.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.080
Yeah, but it's on an Xbox.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.280
My hands will melt if I touch the controller.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.680
I used to be like that.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.680
I'm still like that.

11:50.680 --> 11:54.600
And then there were a lot more games that came out, and it was a lot cheaper.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.080
I'm still going to play it.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.800
I'm just going to put on gloves or something.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.280
Just pretend it's something else.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.520
I don't know why you have this rampant hate for Xbox, but whatever.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.840
I'm like, Xbox hate is so like five years ago.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.400
I mean, we're all kind of over it now.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.080
It's not hate, it's just extreme dislike.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.560
If you go back into the early episodes of Orange Lounge Radio, there used to be plenty

12:13.560 --> 12:15.800
of Xbox hate when that first Xbox came out.

12:15.800 --> 12:20.000
Remember the controller that was so massive that only a gorilla could use it, really?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.680
But now, Xbox is actually pretty cool.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.960
A lot's changed, Rice Princess, within the now.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.600
Except they have never fixed the D-pad, and that is unacceptable.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.600
That's true.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.600
Exactly.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.480
All right.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.480
Let's see, my gaming week.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.280
Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff in my gaming week this week, kind of a lot

12:37.280 --> 12:41.040
of the old stuff, you know, Fable 2, and same stuff I've been playing.

12:41.040 --> 12:46.040
Next week, though, thanks to a very, very, very kind listener, I've got a code for Left

12:46.040 --> 12:48.800
for Dead now, so I'm going to be playing that on PC this week.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.040
I'm very excited.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.320
And to follow up a question that came up last week, there is an Orange Lounge Radio Steam

12:55.320 --> 12:59.800
community out there, and I was able to find it very easy by going into Steam and just

12:59.800 --> 13:02.200
searching for Orange Lounge in groups, so I joined it.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.360
So there's about 30-some-odd people in the Orange Lounge Radio Steam group, so if you

13:05.360 --> 13:09.040
are a Left for Dead player, you're listening to this show, I encourage you to join our

13:09.040 --> 13:13.600
Steam group, because I'll probably be playing Left for Dead, and I want to play with listeners,

13:13.600 --> 13:17.960
but you have to promise to be nice to me, because I suck at first-person shooters.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.720
So even if I accidentally shoot you and think you're a zombie or whatever, you have to be

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
nice to me.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.720
You know what they mean in that game?

13:23.720 --> 13:24.720
That would be kind of fun.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
What?

13:25.720 --> 13:28.040
Because you know how they, like, mix stuff around, you know, like, Half-Life and stuff,

13:28.040 --> 13:29.720
and it's all in the source engine anyways.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.800
Maybe a portal gun in Left for Dead.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.800
You never know.

13:33.800 --> 13:34.800
That would be kind of funny.

13:34.800 --> 13:35.800
What about the Gravity Gun?

13:35.800 --> 13:36.800
Both.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.800
You never know.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
Yeah.

13:38.800 --> 13:43.680
Otherwise, the other game I've been playing this week, kind of funny, I kind of, you know,

13:43.680 --> 13:47.580
we had the whole conversation last week about how I left WoW, but this week I kind of dabbled

13:47.580 --> 13:48.760
in another MMO.

13:48.760 --> 13:54.360
I played Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst this week, which is funny because Sega, like, stopped

13:54.360 --> 13:55.880
supporting that game years ago.

13:55.880 --> 14:00.800
Well, there's a pirate server that you can play on for free, and I'm okay with talking

14:00.800 --> 14:04.760
about it on the show, because Sega kind of turns a blind eye to the whole thing, because

14:04.760 --> 14:09.740
they turned their servers off a while ago, so they just kind of let this thing run.

14:09.740 --> 14:10.740
So it's interesting.

14:10.740 --> 14:14.640
It's kind of tough to play, because they're still, like, I can't do a lot of the quests

14:14.640 --> 14:19.680
because they're all in the Japanese text still, but it's Phantasy Star Online, and it's free,

14:19.680 --> 14:20.680
so I can't complain.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.560
I don't think I'll play it forever, but ah, memories.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.720
Wow.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.880
How long ago did that come out?

14:26.880 --> 14:27.880
Let's see.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.520
If the Dreamcast is about 10 years old, right, Dreamcast came out 9-9-99, right?

14:31.520 --> 14:32.520
I think so.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.640
I would say the first Phantasy Star Online is probably about 9 years old.

14:35.640 --> 14:36.640
Holy crap.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.080
I know, it's an old game.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.080
I know.

14:39.080 --> 14:44.000
But still, I mean, there's not a lot of, like, action-based MMOs like that.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I can't even really call Phantasy Star Online an MMO, though.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I mean, it is and it isn't.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.080
It's not an MMO like WoW, you know, you go off, everything's like instanced.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.500
It's more Guild Wars, I guess, than anything, but it's not even like that.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.500
It's like action-based.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.500
It is pretty cool, though.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.500
Yeah, I know.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.960
It's really stood the test of time, you know?

15:00.960 --> 15:04.360
Even though a lot of people hate on universe, I don't mind universe.

15:04.360 --> 15:09.640
I think I have Phantasy Star Online for my Dreamcast, because I remember I always would

15:09.640 --> 15:10.640
play it offline.

15:10.640 --> 15:16.680
I would never play it online, because I just, you know, I had dial-up at the time, you know,

15:16.680 --> 15:18.240
so it didn't really make...

15:18.240 --> 15:19.880
That'd be kind of hard, yeah.

15:19.880 --> 15:24.600
Well, I mean, they did have a dial-up modem in, you know, Dreamcast, so...

15:24.600 --> 15:31.080
Well, apparently, this server will let you connect the Dreamcast one, the PlaySta...

15:31.080 --> 15:32.080
Was there a PlayStitch one?

15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
I don't know.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.800
The GameCube one, I know, was on there, and the PC one.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.720
You can connect all those together on this one server.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.800
This is Blue Burst, right?

15:40.800 --> 15:44.840
You can use either the Blue Burst client or the Dreamcast client, and it's episode one,

15:44.840 --> 15:45.840
two, and four.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.220
You can play them all together, which I thought was kind of cool.

15:48.220 --> 15:52.880
Just not the Xbox one, because the Xbox one was through Xbox Live, and so there's no way

15:52.880 --> 15:57.360
you can play that anymore, because Sega shut down the server, and you can't really hack

15:57.360 --> 16:00.760
Xbox Live servers without a lot of problems, so...

16:00.760 --> 16:02.280
Well, you can, but...

16:02.280 --> 16:05.600
Yeah, again, it's not something I think I'm gonna play a long time.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.120
It's just, you know, nostalgia's pretty cool, so...

16:08.120 --> 16:12.040
Because, you know, honestly, the cave level gets so boring after a while.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.520
It totally does.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.520
Have you even played PSO?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.520
No.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.520
But I'm sure it does.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.520
It does.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.520
It does.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.520
Okay, I take...

16:21.520 --> 16:22.520
I never got to the cave level.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.520
Really?

16:23.520 --> 16:24.520
No.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.520
You just played Forest over and over again?

16:25.520 --> 16:26.520
Yep, that's all I did.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.520
Oh my god, you must have been bored.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.920
You can do caves at, like, level seven.

16:28.920 --> 16:29.920
You don't have to get that far.

16:29.920 --> 16:33.560
I don't think I played Phantasy Star Online that long, because I remember I tried fighting

16:33.560 --> 16:38.200
the first, like, dragon or whatever it was, and I died, and I'm like, I'm gonna go play

16:38.200 --> 16:39.200
a different game now.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.920
Yeah, it helps to have friends to do the dragon, but, you know...

16:41.920 --> 16:44.680
Remember, I was playing single player, so I had no friends.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.240
Aww, poor Loki.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.680
Well everyone else had PlayStation, and, you know, the only reason I had Dreamcast is because

16:50.680 --> 16:53.520
I wanted to use our all-nighter event.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.520
I'm like, oh-kay.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.520
Wow.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.200
Hey, Dreamcast are still awesome.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.320
I mean, because of the fact that you can boot, like, there's a lot of homebrew stuff for

17:02.320 --> 17:05.120
Dreamcast with the emulators and everything.

17:05.120 --> 17:12.800
I was actually, I'm looking to find a, because I'm not gonna try to buy it, screw that shit.

17:12.800 --> 17:18.560
I'm trying to find a copy of Super Runabout for the Dreamcast, because for some reason,

17:18.560 --> 17:25.240
like, I thought of this one game that I played before, it's called Felny 1179, that was on

17:25.240 --> 17:28.840
the PlayStation 1, and it's a pretty fun game.

17:28.840 --> 17:33.960
It's kind of like, not really like Burnout, but it's a racing game where you're supposed

17:33.960 --> 17:39.600
to crash into a lot of stuff, like, cause a lot of property damage, and as you'd play

17:39.600 --> 17:43.920
through the game, you'd unlock more cars, kind of like Burnout, like ridiculous stuff,

17:43.920 --> 17:48.440
like, you know, meteorite cars, buses, and just all sorts of crazy stuff.

17:48.440 --> 17:53.080
But Super Runabout was kind of the same game, same type of thing, and it was just really

17:53.080 --> 17:54.560
stupid fun.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.380
That's a game that you really, you know, make a new one of, cause you'd be left on Burnout

17:58.380 --> 18:00.600
with collateral damage.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.340
So I need to find that, so I can play that again.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.360
Quite a bit of Dreamcast love coming from our chat room.

18:06.360 --> 18:10.560
We have Leo Shen saying, I still play Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on my Dreamcast all the time.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.080
I love that game so much.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.240
Did you own a Dreamcast?

18:13.240 --> 18:16.160
We did own a Dreamcast, yeah.

18:16.160 --> 18:21.480
TGM-GS6, there's no easy way to pronounce that, says, I need to revive my Dreamcast

18:21.480 --> 18:22.800
so I can play Border Down.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.200
You know, they keep releasing these, like, homebrew things, like, every year for Dreamcast.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.920
I was just thinking today, actually, while I was playing PSO, cause it got me thinking

18:29.920 --> 18:30.920
about the Dreamcast.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.760
The Dreamcast isn't even 10 years old yet.

18:32.760 --> 18:37.660
You know, it's still, it's not that old of a system, all things considered, so, still

18:37.660 --> 18:40.320
pretty interesting, all the things you can do on it.

18:40.320 --> 18:45.040
Let me ask Silent Nathan real quick how his gaming week was, and then we'll move into

18:45.040 --> 18:46.040
tonight's news.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.560
Silent Nathan, how was your gaming week?

18:48.560 --> 18:53.680
It takes a long time to make enough gold to buy a motorcycle.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.760
So wow wow and more wow?

18:55.760 --> 18:56.760
See.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.560
Enough said from Silent Nathan.

18:58.560 --> 19:03.360
Alright, quickly some housekeeping tonight, and then we will get into tonight's gaming

19:03.360 --> 19:04.360
news.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.360
I just wanted to say really quick, I have to further apologize to those listeners that

19:07.360 --> 19:11.800
listen to us on Justin.tv, because we have no webcam again tonight, but here's the interesting

19:11.800 --> 19:13.000
thing that's going on.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.440
We actually, a very kind listener over in Japan sent us a webcam, so I want to say thank

19:18.440 --> 19:19.440
you.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.260
The problem with it though, when we tried to hook it up, we were able to get video but

19:22.260 --> 19:27.480
no audio, because the video and audio was separate on it, so we thought it would be

19:27.480 --> 19:30.480
kind of lame to just have the video thing on Justin.tv.

19:30.480 --> 19:34.560
So I have a cord coming that's going to fix our problems, but it's just not going to get

19:34.560 --> 19:37.640
here until this week sometime, because it's coming from New Jersey.

19:37.640 --> 19:43.200
So I'm really, really, really, really hoping we will be back up on Justin.tv next week.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.480
And yeah, very excited about that.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.760
And then when you come over looking all pretty in the future Rice Princess, it won't be for

19:49.760 --> 19:52.040
nothing, as you did a couple weeks ago.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.040
Yay!

19:53.040 --> 19:54.040
There you go.

19:54.040 --> 19:59.640
Also, of course, there's no Dark Sakura tonight, but she will be back next week on the program,

19:59.640 --> 20:03.160
and no shows off or anything coming up for us.

20:03.160 --> 20:07.720
We're just cranking right through up until our seventh anniversary this June, if you

20:07.720 --> 20:09.640
can believe it.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.640
Wow.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.440
Possibly some conventions in our future.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.360
I am toying with the idea of going to ASEN.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.440
Do you know it's very cheap to fly out to Chicago right now in Southwest?

20:17.440 --> 20:18.440
Really?

20:18.440 --> 20:20.440
It's like $99 one way.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.440
Oh, they're having a $99 sale.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.440
That's why.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.440
Exactly.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.440
So I might go to ASEN.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.440
You should.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.440
Just for the heck of it.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.680
It's in May, and I know some of...

20:28.680 --> 20:29.680
That's like the...

20:29.680 --> 20:31.920
I've been to the East Coast, and I've met listeners on the East Coast.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.160
I've just never been to ASEN's Anime Central, sorry, in Chicago.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.840
I know we have listeners in that area, Chicago area.

20:38.840 --> 20:39.840
I want to go.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.200
I want to do the panel and the whole nine yards.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.800
I think I'd have a lot of fun.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.560
I'm sure Dark Sakura wants to go.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.160
Loki's wife probably won't let him go.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.160
Well, I don't want to go either.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.720
Who knows?

20:49.720 --> 20:50.720
Sorry.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.760
We will see.

20:51.760 --> 20:52.760
I'm going to try.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.760
I'm going to try.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.760
Trust me.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.760
If I'm going to go to one show this year, it's going to be E3.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.640
Yeah, E3.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.560
You know E3 registration opened up this week, actually.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.840
So we've got to talk offline about that.

21:03.840 --> 21:08.040
Yeah, because my wife, I don't think she'll mind if I...

21:08.040 --> 21:11.800
She will mind if I go, but she will get over it.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.240
I still think we should take her as a special correspondent.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.240
She will...

21:15.240 --> 21:17.800
See, we've been talking because I have this thing through my work.

21:17.800 --> 21:22.880
I have a $1,500 trip we've got to take before the end of this year.

21:22.880 --> 21:28.600
So we were saying we're going to go originally to Seattle, and we're going to say, eh, it's

21:28.600 --> 21:30.320
not really much that we really want to do in Seattle.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.320
Go to Prosser.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.640
That's where the party's at this weekend.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.880
We were going to go to possibly L.A. to go to Disneyland, that kind of stuff.

21:37.880 --> 21:42.720
But I mean, it would be around her birthday, and her birthday is the 4th of June, and that's

21:42.720 --> 21:43.960
like the week before.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.560
No, that is the week of E3, I think.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.560
Oh, yeah.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
Wow.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
No, no, it's not.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
E3 is like June 2nd through 4th.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.560
I'm not even kidding you.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
Ah, fuck that.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
Hold on.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.560
Let me look.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.560
Want, want, want.

21:55.560 --> 21:56.560
Dude, dude, dude.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.560
I thought it was like the 13th or something.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.560
Just be like, happy birthday, babe.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.560
E3.com.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.560
Look at all these video games I gotcha.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.560
Entrance into E3.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
I gotcha.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.560
Goodie bag from E3.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.560
Yeah, June 2nd through 4th.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.560
Ah, you ass.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.560
Oh, no.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.800
Well, there's no way I'm going to E3 now, so.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.560
We'll just be like, but babe, you can get a bunch of swag.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.320
Ah, yeah, that's not going to fly.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.760
You could walk around a bunch of, like, smelly nerds.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.760
Yay.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.120
Yeah, that will not fly.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.080
You should at least try to get down for one day, get back in time for her birthday or

22:26.080 --> 22:27.080
something.

22:27.080 --> 22:32.160
Because, you know, the third day of E3 is always like the, I am a zombie today, and

22:32.160 --> 22:35.920
just, I'm just going through the motions trying to pick up everything I missed.

22:35.920 --> 22:36.920
True.

22:36.920 --> 22:37.920
So, think about it.

22:37.920 --> 22:38.920
Think about it.

22:38.920 --> 22:39.920
All right.

22:39.920 --> 22:40.920
I'll think about it.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
All right.

22:41.920 --> 22:42.920
If we can even get in.

22:42.920 --> 22:43.920
I know.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.360
Hey, you can pull some strings now.

22:45.360 --> 22:46.360
You have connections, dude.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
Oh, yeah, right.

22:47.360 --> 22:51.440
No, seriously, like, back when we went in 2005, we were still kind of fledgling, but

22:51.440 --> 22:52.440
now you can just, like.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.440
That's true.

22:53.440 --> 22:58.680
Because it worked at a certain game company that, I don't know if I should say, because

22:58.680 --> 23:02.760
I don't know if the game company knows that they inadvertently let us in E3, but we got

23:02.760 --> 23:03.760
those tickets.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.760
Who cares?

23:04.760 --> 23:09.160
We could bring our old badges from 2005 and be like, look, we went in 2005.

23:09.160 --> 23:13.040
No, they specifically have made it, like, you have to reapply even if you went before.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.040
I don't know.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.040
Anyway.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.040
Damn it.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.040
We'll worry about that in the upcoming weeks.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.040
We got time.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.040
We got time.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.040
We have at least till May.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.040
All right.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.600
Anyhow, we got to get into the gaming news tonight.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.600
Ricky!

23:23.600 --> 23:24.600
Get us into some gaming news.

23:24.600 --> 23:30.720
Yes, it's not that exciting, but we may be getting a new channel soon.

23:30.720 --> 23:37.520
Apparently, there is a trademark, well, this is, I think, coming to Europe first.

23:37.520 --> 23:43.200
There was a trademark on the European trademark database that suggests that Nintendo is looking

23:43.200 --> 23:49.520
to bring its DigiCam print channel to Europe and potentially elsewhere as the photo print

23:49.520 --> 23:51.120
service channel.

23:51.120 --> 23:57.080
And basically what the DigiCam print channel is in Japan is it's a service offered through

23:57.080 --> 24:03.680
Fujifilm that, of course, allows you to print photos that you save to an SD card and you

24:03.680 --> 24:06.780
can upload them off your photo channel.

24:06.780 --> 24:12.200
Can I just, like, use my printer that lets me put the SD card right in front of the printer?

24:12.200 --> 24:17.640
You can also customize them so that you have Nintendo themed photo albums.

24:17.640 --> 24:23.520
You can even order business cards featuring Nintendo backgrounds in Mii pictures and also

24:23.520 --> 24:29.080
the business cards available through, you know, Club Nintendo in Japan as well.

24:29.080 --> 24:34.100
Yeah, I think it's kind of useless, but, you know, whatever.

24:34.100 --> 24:37.920
New services, you know, new.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.920
That it is.

24:38.920 --> 24:39.920
I guess.

24:39.920 --> 24:43.400
Is that something, you know, you're a Nintendo fangirl, Rice Princess.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.560
Is this something you'd want to use?

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
No.

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
No?

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
No?

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
No.

24:48.560 --> 24:55.320
But if I didn't, I might consider it, but really no.

24:55.320 --> 25:01.080
Some other things coming to the future in Nintendo's world is the Wii Fit body check

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
channel.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.080
What?

25:03.080 --> 25:06.400
The Wii Fit body check channel.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.520
It's going to be something that's launching on the Wii in April.

25:09.520 --> 25:13.920
I guess what this game does, it uses your BMI data, that's your body mass index that

25:13.920 --> 25:20.760
you get from Wii Fit, and you get the step data from personal trainers walking pedometer.

25:20.760 --> 25:24.060
This is in Japan, by the way, because I don't think we have that game here yet.

25:24.060 --> 25:29.000
And you get some personalized guidance from, like, health experts.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.280
Walk more, fatty.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.280
Stay healthy.

25:32.280 --> 25:37.460
Or they'll probably say, you should actually play your Wii Fit game because we know you

25:37.460 --> 25:39.920
stopped about a week after you bought it.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.080
Now there's speculation there that, you know, this channel again has been announced for

25:43.080 --> 25:47.080
Japan, the Wii Fit body check channel, but they also have trademarked something called

25:47.080 --> 25:48.560
Nintendo Active Health.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.760
That was something that was trademarked in Europe a little earlier this year, so maybe

25:52.760 --> 25:54.080
this is the same thing.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.080
Who knows?

25:55.080 --> 25:59.520
I think Active Health might, it might be the DS game.

25:59.520 --> 26:05.920
The DS, instead of personal trainer walking, it's Active Health or some sort of, I don't

26:05.920 --> 26:06.920
know.

26:06.920 --> 26:10.720
I could see it, you know, tying in with Wii Fit and stuff and then maybe them doing, like,

26:10.720 --> 26:13.880
updates Wii Fit to, you know, incorporate data from that.

26:13.880 --> 26:14.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.880
Update Wii Fit?

26:15.880 --> 26:16.880
No, no, no.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.240
Nintendo doesn't do updates like that.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.240
No, no, no.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.240
They don't do patches and shit.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.240
Well, I know.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.240
They will release Wii Fit 2.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.240
No, no.

26:23.240 --> 26:29.800
Well, of course, yes, they'll do that, but I'm saying that they'll release this channel

26:29.800 --> 26:34.000
and they'll tie in, you know, it'll be able to tie in with the DS game.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I guess.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.680
Yeah, what, what, what extra kind of tips are you gonna get from these health professionals

26:39.680 --> 26:43.320
who don't even, like, see you, you know?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.320
These games do nothing about your diet, do they?

26:45.320 --> 26:46.320
No.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.320
I don't think so.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.800
I mean, if you really want to lose weight, it has to be an eating and exercise thing,

26:49.800 --> 26:50.800
right?

26:50.800 --> 26:51.800
Me, sometimes.

26:51.800 --> 26:52.800
Everything I've ever heard said that.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.520
You just have to eat less calories.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.680
That's where personal trainer cooking comes into play.

26:57.680 --> 26:59.040
Personal trainer cooking, mama?

26:59.040 --> 27:03.320
No, personal trainer cooking and then they'll, you know, give you recipe ideas and stuff

27:03.320 --> 27:09.640
like that and then somehow, you know, your being fat will be attributed to your not being

27:09.640 --> 27:13.280
good at math and that's where personal training math will come into play.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.280
No!

27:14.280 --> 27:17.440
I knew that was the reason why I was fat.

27:17.440 --> 27:22.640
Um, AcidicVampire in chat says, so Nintendo is releasing this but not Mother 3.

27:22.640 --> 27:23.640
Hmm.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.640
Jerks.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.640
I know.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.640
Just kidding, I love Nintendo.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.640
Well, is Mother 3 gonna get you in shape?

27:27.640 --> 27:29.760
No, I don't think so.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.760
Think of the greater good.

27:30.760 --> 27:31.760
Think of the children.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.720
Yes, no, would, would soccer moms be interested in Mother 3?

27:34.720 --> 27:35.720
I don't think so.

27:35.720 --> 27:36.720
Probably not.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.680
But a personalized health coach?

27:38.680 --> 27:41.840
That's, that's like what every soccer mom prays for before they go to bed.

27:41.840 --> 27:42.840
Yeah.

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
So, we'll see.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.560
Well, um, there's some pretty cool news.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.440
This week they announced that there's gonna be a sequel to Boom Blocks coming out, Boom

27:50.440 --> 27:52.360
Blocks Bash Party.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.800
It's gonna have some additional levels and some other fun stuff.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.920
But what's also kinda neat is they announced- That sounds really close to Boom Blocks Bachelor

27:59.920 --> 28:00.920
Party.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.720
Now that would make that game a hell of a lot more interesting, wouldn't it?

28:04.720 --> 28:06.660
Um, yes, it would.

28:06.660 --> 28:09.520
Too bad it's not gonna happen that way.

28:09.520 --> 28:12.600
But apparently there's also something else that's interesting about it.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.860
It's not gonna have friend codes.

28:14.860 --> 28:20.840
There will be the ability to download and upload new levels and rate others, other people's

28:20.840 --> 28:22.040
works.

28:22.040 --> 28:28.360
And there will not be any additional security measures as far as friend's codes go.

28:28.360 --> 28:35.680
But then again, this is an EA game, so, um, you know, maybe they're gonna have that stupid

28:35.680 --> 28:38.640
break to sign up for, like, EA servers or something like that.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.760
But still though, that's not friend's codes, and, um, that's pretty cool.

28:42.760 --> 28:47.120
It's interesting it's taken this long for somebody to finally defy the friend code system.

28:47.120 --> 28:51.120
I didn't- you know, I think a lot of us thought it was impossible, that if you wanted to do

28:51.120 --> 28:54.260
the online Nintendo thing, you had to do friend's codes.

28:54.260 --> 28:58.080
I think what makes this story notable is not necessarily who or what game is doing it,

28:58.080 --> 29:01.120
but the whole fact that it can be done.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
Yes.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.960
And the other thing that's interesting, you might remember that there was that rumor before

29:04.960 --> 29:08.280
that there was gonna be a major game that would not use friend codes.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.280
Here it is.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.780
Boom Blocks is a major game?

29:11.780 --> 29:12.780
It actually is.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.380
It is a pretty major game.

29:14.380 --> 29:18.880
It sold really well, the first one, and it's been a pretty fun puzzle game.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.520
I'm telling you though, the puzzle games need some tits in them.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.320
It's- they would- Like Gals Panic!

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
No, no, no, no, no.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.320
I know I've gotten into this on the show before.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.320
Gals Panic I fully approve of.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.320
Me too.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.520
But not all puzzle games need tits in it.

29:30.520 --> 29:35.140
If you will remember, Bubble Bath Babes, not a good puzzle game.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.140
Nobody bought it.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.200
But it was a start.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.600
You know, Rome wasn't built in a day.

29:40.600 --> 29:46.740
They tried, and you know, I don't know why that was never further explored, but you know,

29:46.740 --> 29:49.920
why did Miss Nude World have to stop at 96?

29:49.920 --> 29:51.580
I know.

29:51.580 --> 29:55.780
And remember in Leisure Suit Larry, they came out with one like a couple years back?

29:55.780 --> 29:58.080
Like I thought that did pretty well, didn't it?

29:58.080 --> 29:59.080
No.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.080
How did the Leisure Suit Larry do?

30:00.080 --> 30:01.080
I don't know.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.080
But I thought that was like a-

30:02.080 --> 30:03.080
But they are making another one.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.080
Cult franchise or something.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.080
Really?

30:05.080 --> 30:06.080
Yeah.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.080
Wow.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.800
It's just- it's on hold right now because Sierra, which is part of the Vindi Universal-

30:09.800 --> 30:17.240
well, the Vindi Universal got bought up by Activision, and you know, all their properties

30:17.240 --> 30:21.060
are kind of being sold off and redirected, so.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.060
It's still in the works.

30:22.060 --> 30:28.720
I mean, it's supposed to be- well, right now I think we had it dated for April, but I don't

30:28.720 --> 30:31.760
think it's going to come out in April, but probably this year.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.200
And it's Leisure Suit Larry's box office bust.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.880
Okay.

30:36.880 --> 30:41.080
Because see, this is the little, you know, Larry, and he has to help his uncle, Larry,

30:41.080 --> 30:47.880
who's the original Leisure Suit Larry, and they're in Hollywood, and, oh, it's funny!

30:47.880 --> 30:50.880
And there's like, cartoony women with big boobs, and-

30:50.880 --> 30:54.720
That'll have sex with him eventually.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.720
They get drunk-

30:55.720 --> 30:58.760
Let's find an audio clip of that song from Miss World, Nude 96.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.720
I know we used to have it years ago on this show.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.440
Yeah, we've played it before.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.240
I know, it's been years.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.760
It fits the mood so well, too, for a puzzle game.

31:07.760 --> 31:11.920
Anyhow, here's a puzzle game that's going to be coming to WiiWare, it's Bubble Bobble

31:11.920 --> 31:12.920
on WiiWare.

31:12.920 --> 31:14.100
I love Bubble Bobble.

31:14.100 --> 31:19.000
No word yet if it's going to have a level 30 bug that you can't find the boss in it,

31:19.000 --> 31:23.240
but actually what's kind of interesting about it, it's been, I guess, published in Famitsu

31:23.240 --> 31:28.440
Magazine, and the game looks like it's gotten a bit of an upgrade, it looks like the graphics

31:28.440 --> 31:31.920
are, you know, this doesn't look like a port of the arcade, and certainly not the old NES

31:31.920 --> 31:35.360
version, so when we say Bubble Bobble's coming to WiiWare, I'm not talking about just a port

31:35.360 --> 31:40.140
of the NES game, it looks like some newer version of Bubble Bobble made specifically

31:40.140 --> 31:41.140
for WiiWare.

31:41.140 --> 31:45.520
And, the NES game pissed me off, especially when you have that special, was it level 99

31:45.520 --> 31:49.320
that you had to do something special to get to the levels beyond that?

31:49.320 --> 31:53.480
Well, here's the interesting thing, it's going to be 400 stages in this new WiiWare version,

31:53.480 --> 31:58.640
it's a full, it's going to have a full recreation of the original Bubble Bobble, some higher

31:58.640 --> 32:01.980
difficulty levels if you are so inclined.

32:01.980 --> 32:05.760
Here's the other cool thing though, apparently the new WiiWare one, four player local co-op,

32:05.760 --> 32:11.280
because you might remember the original was only two, and a brand new enemy.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
Just one.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.240
Just one, but a brand new enemy.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.940
Apparently there's going to be download content for this game as well, 200 points a pop for

32:18.940 --> 32:22.480
the download content, no word though how much the game itself is going to cost, I imagine

32:22.480 --> 32:23.480
probably like 800.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.480
Four million dollars!

32:24.480 --> 32:29.840
So, but yeah, the download content will be 50 additional stages of high difficulty.

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
Wow.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.280
And a unique boss character in each one, ooh!

32:33.280 --> 32:37.660
I think that they should go all out with this, release an external peripheral that you can

32:37.660 --> 32:42.200
attach to the Wii via USB, and it would be a bubble blowing machine, so that as you're

32:42.200 --> 32:45.680
playing the game, you know, it would blow bubbles at you.

32:45.680 --> 32:50.840
I've seen those in home, on PlayStation 3, like have you seen this, like in the, randomly

32:50.840 --> 32:55.000
in the mall on home, there's bubble blowing machines, for no particular reason, they're

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
just sitting there in the middle of the mall.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.280
I think like every time you blow a bubble in the game, they should blow another bubble

32:58.280 --> 33:00.960
out at you, I mean that would be kind of funny.

33:00.960 --> 33:01.960
That would be pretty awesome.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.640
That would be very immersive if you did that.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.920
That's like a whole like 4D type of gaming I don't think has been explored yet.

33:07.920 --> 33:10.320
Like Bubble Bobble featuring real bubbles.

33:10.320 --> 33:15.400
It's like smell-o-vision, but better, I'd say.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.240
You need to patent that idea, Loki.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.240
Quick.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.240
That's alright.

33:19.240 --> 33:24.080
I don't think that I'm really going to get my feelings hurt if someone actually releases

33:24.080 --> 33:25.080
a bubble blowing machine.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.800
Of course then, the bubble blowing machine, it breaks after 30 bubbles.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.160
That's the downside to it.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.160
That's ridiculous.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.160
Very limited.

33:32.160 --> 33:37.840
Well, Nintendo revealed their launch schedule for the second quarter of 2000.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.840
I have to read this comment.

33:38.840 --> 33:43.400
I know I've been reading this guy a lot tonight, but the stuff he's been saying is funny.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.280
Acidic Vampire says, Bubbles are fabulous.

33:46.280 --> 33:49.240
Makes me feel like Amy Adams in Enchanted.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.640
Or Glenda the Good Witch.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.640
Nevermind.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.640
Yeah.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.640
I get it.

33:53.640 --> 33:54.640
Alright.

33:54.640 --> 33:55.640
Read the damn next story.

33:55.640 --> 33:56.640
Alright.

33:56.640 --> 34:00.120
Well anyways, not really, I mean, I guess the second quarter, but everything that they've

34:00.120 --> 34:04.280
announced so far for 2009.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.280
Not a big surprise.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.800
Japan, they've got some pretty cool stuff coming out.

34:07.800 --> 34:16.000
You know, they have a sequel to, well, what they call over there Famicom Wars, which is

34:16.000 --> 34:17.800
Advance Wars over here.

34:17.800 --> 34:21.120
DS2 is coming out sometime in, you know, 2009.

34:21.120 --> 34:26.800
There's going to be a Tomodachi collection that's coming out in 2009.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.400
New Picross game, it's coming out in March.

34:29.400 --> 34:33.920
Mario & Luigi RPG 3, which is scheduled to come out over there.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.440
Oh finally, an interesting sounding game.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.520
February 11th.

34:38.520 --> 34:43.520
And then on the Wii, of course they've got their new play control games, Mario Power

34:43.520 --> 34:48.040
Tennis coming out, actually it's already come out over there.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.280
That was January 15th.

34:51.280 --> 34:58.040
This week there's another code R, which is Trace Memory is what they called it over here

34:58.040 --> 35:01.400
on the DS, but that's on the Wii now.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.320
New play control Metroid Prime.

35:04.320 --> 35:11.560
Also Pikmin 2, Metroid Prime is coming out in a couple weeks there, and Pikmin 2 in March.

35:11.560 --> 35:15.560
Wii Sports Resort sometime in the spring, of course that's going to be over here as

35:15.560 --> 35:18.160
well.

35:18.160 --> 35:21.080
Sin and Punishment 2, of course sometime this year.

35:21.080 --> 35:29.600
Endless Ocean 2, Hoshi no Kirby, Lion Attack Heroes, that's a weird name, Chibi-Robo,

35:29.600 --> 35:34.520
they're going to do a new play control for that in Metroid Prime 2 as well.

35:34.520 --> 35:38.920
And then they have some really weird names, oh Cosmic Walker, I guess that's a space version

35:38.920 --> 35:42.580
of Endless Ocean, you're kind of space walking.

35:42.580 --> 35:49.080
And then Dynamic Zen, Spurn Smashers, and Punch Out.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.480
So that's interesting.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.520
That's one game that had a lot of people excited previously was Punch Out, the new one.

35:56.520 --> 35:59.360
Sometime it's going to be coming out.

35:59.360 --> 36:04.840
And then of course in the US, some of the stuff that's already been announced, Fire

36:04.840 --> 36:08.960
Emblem, Shadow Dragon, that's going to be coming out in a couple weeks, Pokemon Platinum

36:08.960 --> 36:14.280
in March, Personal Trainer Walking, remember on the DS, that might go in with that whole

36:14.280 --> 36:18.400
rumor there that that's actually going to come out over here, that update, coming out

36:18.400 --> 36:20.560
sometime in 2009.

36:20.560 --> 36:26.000
Rhythm Heaven coming out sometime in 2009, actually early April for that one.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.360
Mario and Luigi RPG 3 coming out at some point, I'm going to guess probably May for that.

36:32.360 --> 36:36.440
How long does it freakin' take to localize a game, Rhythm Heaven's not coming out until

36:36.440 --> 36:37.440
April?

36:37.440 --> 36:43.360
They were teasing that one at PAX last year, they were playing that.

36:43.360 --> 36:50.400
And then the DSi sometime spring or summer of 2009, so that April rumor might actually

36:50.400 --> 36:51.660
come true.

36:51.660 --> 36:57.480
And then on the Wii, we've got Mario Power Tennis coming out in March as well as Pikmin.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.880
Those are both coming out actually I think the same day.

36:59.880 --> 37:03.840
Wii Sports Resort sometime in the first half of the year, Punch Out also in the first half

37:03.840 --> 37:11.920
of the year, so probably Wii Sports, I'm going to try to guess here, maybe April and Punch

37:11.920 --> 37:16.400
Out May or June, or maybe both June.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.680
And then Sin and Punishment 2 sometime in 2009, which looks awesome.

37:20.680 --> 37:29.320
And then of course in Europe, they're getting Rhythm Paradise over there, which, same game.

37:29.320 --> 37:33.000
Walk With Me, do you know your walking routine?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.760
Which comes with two activity meters.

37:34.760 --> 37:40.000
At least it wasn't Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me, do you know your fire walking routine?

37:40.000 --> 37:45.920
They're getting Mario and Luigi RPG as well, Pokemon Platinum sometime in the first half

37:45.920 --> 37:46.920
of the year.

37:46.920 --> 37:47.920
Who killed Laura Palmer?

37:47.920 --> 37:49.600
You better moonwalk to find out!

37:49.600 --> 37:54.760
Kirby Superstar Ultra is also coming out over there, and then DSI Hardware sometime spring

37:54.760 --> 37:55.840
or summer.

37:55.840 --> 38:01.240
And then of course they're getting almost the same stuff as far as the play control

38:01.240 --> 38:02.240
games.

38:02.240 --> 38:07.600
Pikmin coming out February, that's surprising that they get Pikmin way before us.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.360
Mario Power Tennis is coming out in March.

38:10.360 --> 38:12.360
Fire Walk With Me!

38:12.360 --> 38:15.560
Punch Out, stop it!

38:15.560 --> 38:19.400
Punch Out in the first half of the year, new play control Pikmin in the first half of the

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
year.

38:20.400 --> 38:25.320
Wii Sports Resort is coming out in 2009, right in the first half, and Sin and Punishment

38:25.320 --> 38:26.320
2.

38:26.320 --> 38:31.040
Another code R, so they're getting another code, and Endless Ocean 2 also coming out

38:31.040 --> 38:32.040
over here.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.880
I'm guessing anything that will probably have some more stuff that's unannounced.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.720
Obviously they haven't announced what they're going to be talking about yet.

38:38.720 --> 38:48.640
E3, and just a thought, probably not going to be interesting.

38:48.640 --> 38:49.640
I don't know.

38:49.640 --> 38:50.640
I guess there's a couple interesting games in there.

38:50.640 --> 38:55.560
Unless they announce Excite Truck 2, in which case I will give them, you know, I will apologize

38:55.560 --> 38:57.520
for everything I've said.

38:57.520 --> 39:02.720
But unless there's an Excite Truck 2, you know, that's really the only stipulation.

39:02.720 --> 39:07.240
Excite Truck 2, or they can get the hell out.

39:07.240 --> 39:12.440
Well one game that you might notice is missing from Nintendo's upcoming release calendar,

39:12.440 --> 39:15.320
and boy I hate covering this story.

39:15.320 --> 39:19.480
File this in the bin of things that we don't really think we ought to cover on this show,

39:19.480 --> 39:23.400
but I kind of feel like we have to.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.680
Do you remember Bob?

39:24.680 --> 39:29.600
Bob was the guy that locked himself in a room in his 100-day protest in an effort to get

39:29.600 --> 39:32.680
a development kit for his game, Bob's Game.

39:32.680 --> 39:37.080
And he aborted his protest, I don't know, so many days into it because I guess he couldn't

39:37.080 --> 39:41.520
take it anymore, and basically destroyed his room was the grand finale of the protest.

39:41.520 --> 39:44.080
And no, Nintendo never sent him a kit.

39:44.080 --> 39:47.400
Well, some of the audio you're going to be hearing now in the background there is actually

39:47.400 --> 39:54.200
some video of them defacing property at Nintendo World in New York City.

39:54.200 --> 39:58.440
That's right, that's how they decided to get back at Nintendo for not sending Bob a development

39:58.440 --> 40:02.800
kit is that he got some of his friends together who for some strange reason looked like a

40:02.800 --> 40:08.560
bunch of foreign tourists that would probably have recruited Bob in the very beginning of

40:08.560 --> 40:09.560
the video.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.560
Yeah, I saw him.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.960
Doesn't he look like a tool?

40:11.960 --> 40:17.520
He just, he does just kind of, he does, yeah, he just, he looks like an asshole.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.520
I mean, honestly.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.720
I don't know.

40:20.720 --> 40:24.680
But um, you just, yeah, you see these girls are going into the Nintendo World store and

40:24.680 --> 40:28.000
everybody's filming things going on here, I don't know why they didn't call security,

40:28.000 --> 40:33.640
but they take posters to the side of the store that say Bob's Game, and they end up, I don't

40:33.640 --> 40:38.280
know, handing out flyers to all these people just interrupting, being generally rude.

40:38.280 --> 40:44.400
They slip in business cards into a bunch of the different games, they put mock boxes up

40:44.400 --> 40:48.960
onto the shelves, and they just basically, generally harass people.

40:48.960 --> 40:53.020
And just act like assholes, really, if Jamie was here, she'd be having a field day right

40:53.020 --> 40:56.280
now, honestly, she'd just, oh my god, I can't even imagine.

40:56.280 --> 41:03.040
Let me add that, okay, for one, Bob's Game, great that you made a game all by yourself,

41:03.040 --> 41:07.640
congratulations, you know what, lots of people have done that, and they have taken, you know,

41:07.640 --> 41:13.040
their game online, whatever, and you know, we don't really hear too much about it, but

41:13.040 --> 41:16.720
the fact is, just because you made a game by yourself does not mean it needs to be played.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.320
Look at that, he just dumped a bunch of business cards on the floor.

41:19.320 --> 41:24.240
Oh, what an ass.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.200
I gotta know what the chat room thinks about this.

41:27.200 --> 41:31.520
And then let me say the other thing, his game does not look good, and trust me, he doesn't

41:31.520 --> 41:33.280
seem that creative.

41:33.280 --> 41:39.120
Bob's Game, really, is that what you're gonna call it, Bob's Game, I'm sorry, I know there

41:39.120 --> 41:44.240
is a game actually coming out by Graffiti Entertainment, they're the ones publishing

41:44.240 --> 41:49.600
it, it was a game called Black Siegel, I forget what it was originally called, but it was

41:49.600 --> 41:56.200
a homebrew DS Game Boy Advance game that they finally did get a publisher because they couldn't

41:56.200 --> 42:00.580
publish it on their own, and yeah, it's not one person putting it out, but you know what,

42:00.580 --> 42:04.760
they went through the proper channels and got their game published, because he doesn't

42:04.760 --> 42:10.660
need to publish this game himself, he just needs to find a publisher to do it for him,

42:10.660 --> 42:15.840
and you know, if no one's picking it up, gee I wonder why, and so they're actually going

42:15.840 --> 42:20.220
through channels that may be a really small company, but they're gonna get it published,

42:20.220 --> 42:25.040
and I think his game could probably get published by the same company if he really tried, but

42:25.040 --> 42:29.880
he's an asshole, and honestly, at first I felt bad for him because he couldn't get a

42:29.880 --> 42:33.640
development kit, I don't give a shit now, I think he's an asshole, and I fucking, his

42:33.640 --> 42:39.560
game looks like shit, it looks like something made with the old RPG maker, and it really

42:39.560 --> 42:43.600
does not look good at all, I would not buy this game, especially after all this shit

42:43.600 --> 42:44.600
he's been pulling.

42:44.600 --> 42:49.560
SSJ100Matt in our chat says, fucking douchebag, even if his game came to the DS, I wouldn't

42:49.560 --> 42:50.560
buy it.

42:50.560 --> 42:55.200
GS68 says, for fuck's sake, look at Pixel or Nijoro or whatever, they don't get paid

42:55.200 --> 43:00.520
for their shit and they don't care, and says this should be an OLR stupid award of the

43:00.520 --> 43:03.400
year, and Acidic Vampire says he's being a whiny little bitch.

43:03.400 --> 43:06.040
He pretty much is, what is he hoping to accomplish by doing all this?

43:06.040 --> 43:07.040
For real!

43:07.040 --> 43:10.640
I mean, do you think anybody at Nintendo is gonna, at Nintendo, like executives, are actually

43:10.640 --> 43:11.640
gonna hear about this?

43:11.640 --> 43:14.680
Oh my, you're doing all of this stuff, we should publish, or, you know, make, put your

43:14.680 --> 43:15.680
game out.

43:15.680 --> 43:16.680
Oh, I know!

43:16.680 --> 43:17.680
It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.680
It's like he doesn't get the cops called on him.

43:18.680 --> 43:22.640
He's probably gonna release it as a ROM or something, and still no one's gonna download

43:22.640 --> 43:23.640
it.

43:23.640 --> 43:24.640
He put the video on the internet.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.880
Do you know how stupid that is?

43:26.880 --> 43:31.520
Because like now there's video out there of you essentially vandalizing the property and

43:31.520 --> 43:35.740
making the scene here at the Nintendo World Store or whatever.

43:35.740 --> 43:36.740
You know?

43:36.740 --> 43:38.760
You don't think they might come after you?

43:38.760 --> 43:44.800
I want you, Miyamoto, to come out with like the Master Sword and just like chop him in

43:44.800 --> 43:45.800
half.

43:45.800 --> 43:46.800
That'd be awesome.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.280
I'm sorry, this guy does not need any more of our time, and to be honest, I don't give

43:50.280 --> 43:52.600
a shit if his game ever gets published.

43:52.600 --> 43:56.680
And really, you know, release it as in the homebrew community or something like that,

43:56.680 --> 43:57.900
because you know what?

43:57.900 --> 43:59.520
I don't think anyone's gonna give a shit.

43:59.520 --> 44:03.400
The game doesn't look that great, okay, it has all this, you know, gameplay and stuff

44:03.400 --> 44:05.800
in it, but it doesn't look that good.

44:05.800 --> 44:06.920
It really doesn't.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.080
There's no reason that this should be published.

44:09.080 --> 44:13.280
Gameguru in chat says, Bob's been blackballed from the video game industry, and you know

44:13.280 --> 44:14.280
what?

44:14.280 --> 44:19.320
I think, I think the blogs need to stop giving this guy any attention.

44:19.320 --> 44:20.320
At all.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.320
We should too, so okay.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.080
Go ahead.

44:23.080 --> 44:26.120
He's a dick face, and he's a crappy game developer.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.120
The end of the story.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.120
Let's move on.

44:28.120 --> 44:32.120
I just, I just want to say though, I just want to say, I want to put a request out there

44:32.120 --> 44:33.200
to the OL Army.

44:33.200 --> 44:39.100
If you see this guy getting any more coverage on blogs out there or whatever, please leave

44:39.100 --> 44:44.320
a comment, email the blog, and ask them to please stop giving this guy attention.

44:44.320 --> 44:45.320
It starts here.

44:45.320 --> 44:46.320
No more.

44:46.320 --> 44:48.280
Bob Chat is banned from Orange Lawns Radio.

44:48.280 --> 44:52.320
I don't ever want to hear about this stupid idiot again, and I hope, I hope to hell his

44:52.320 --> 44:55.360
thing gets him in trouble and whatever.

44:55.360 --> 45:00.280
And if you see him on the street, you should kick him in the junk.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.720
I think so.

45:01.720 --> 45:23.320
So the OLR banishment of Bob begins here, and now with our favorite segment.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.840
Loki would you like to start us off with the FUs of the week tonight?

45:25.840 --> 45:26.840
Yes.

45:26.840 --> 45:32.800
I guess I FU'd Bob because he's annoying, and honestly I watched that video clip today

45:32.800 --> 45:35.560
and I was like, oh my god, really?

45:35.560 --> 45:36.880
Are you guys doing this?

45:36.880 --> 45:39.800
I mean, you really think this is going to work?

45:39.800 --> 45:42.040
You just feel awkward watching it, don't you?

45:42.040 --> 45:43.800
It does feel awkward, and I feel-

45:43.800 --> 45:45.400
Like those girls have no idea what they're doing.

45:45.400 --> 45:49.600
And it's not hurting Nintendo at all, it's pissing off the people that have to work in

45:49.600 --> 45:53.560
that damn store, they have to clean up this stupid mess, because you're a stupid game

45:53.560 --> 45:57.800
that's never going to get published, and is not any good anyways.

45:57.800 --> 45:58.800
So what?

45:58.800 --> 46:02.680
You're one person that you made a game, oh my god, you're the first person on earth to

46:02.680 --> 46:03.680
make a game before.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.760
There's a lot of people that make games by themselves, you know, and they put it out

46:07.760 --> 46:09.920
on the Atari and shit like that?

46:09.920 --> 46:14.520
That's how the whole fucking game industry worked, and it's how it became.

46:14.520 --> 46:18.700
Just because you're one dude that makes a game doesn't mean that Nintendo has to give

46:18.700 --> 46:24.840
you a dev kit because you think you're awesome, that you did with one person what a whole

46:24.840 --> 46:26.280
team of people would do.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.280
But guess what?

46:27.280 --> 46:31.440
The game made with a team of people is probably a whole lot better, and it will get published.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.160
Your game, not so much.

46:33.160 --> 46:35.600
I concur.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.600
That's it?

46:36.600 --> 46:37.800
Nothing else to say about your personal life?

46:37.800 --> 46:40.840
Oh, and those burger shot burgers aren't that good anymore.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.440
I'm over- So F you today.

46:43.440 --> 46:46.140
F you, burger shot burgers.

46:46.140 --> 46:49.560
My F you of the week goes to the Super Bowl for cutting into tonight's live ratings.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.360
That's always a bummer.

46:51.360 --> 46:54.180
And then I give an F you to phantom pains I have.

46:54.180 --> 46:58.520
Even after all those surgeries and stuff and scare I had last year, I really don't want

46:58.520 --> 47:00.720
to have pains anymore, so it kind of sucks.

47:00.720 --> 47:03.800
Because then it always freaks me out that it's worst case scenario, like I've got cancer

47:03.800 --> 47:08.160
or something, and it's just, it's stupid, and I just, I just want to be healthy.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.160
For once.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.160
You'll be healthy.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.160
I hate it.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.160
I know.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.400
Rice Princess, your F yous.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.800
Fuck you to Lieutenant Felix Gaeta.

47:16.800 --> 47:22.120
I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but you just pissed off a whole lot of people,

47:22.120 --> 47:25.440
and I hope you fucking die.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.120
I feel so sorry for that actor.

47:27.120 --> 47:29.240
No, I'm sure he's a great actor.

47:29.240 --> 47:30.640
He did a lot of voice work for Ronda.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.280
You know there's people that don't know how to tell the difference, though.

47:33.280 --> 47:34.280
Yeah, I know.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.280
I'm not, like, crazy.

47:35.280 --> 47:40.680
I just don't like him as a character, but I hope he fucking gets airlocks or some shit.

47:40.680 --> 47:44.440
That must be, like, the first gay guy you've, like, really just wanted to beat up.

47:44.440 --> 47:45.440
Yeah, I do.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.440
Oh my god.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.440
I would never be his hag.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.880
I wouldn't be like, go fuck yourself out of an airlock.

47:51.880 --> 47:52.880
I don't know.

47:52.880 --> 47:54.960
But yeah, I'm mad at him, so.

47:54.960 --> 47:55.960
Alright.

47:55.960 --> 47:58.760
Uh, does Silent Nathan have any F yous of the week, or is he sleeping?

47:58.760 --> 48:01.240
No, he's shaking, no, he's shaking his head, though.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.240
A simple no.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.240
Alright.

48:03.240 --> 48:04.240
That's it.

48:04.240 --> 48:10.320
Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, you don't see Aaron from Snake 360 pulling that crap.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.320
That's true.

48:11.320 --> 48:14.160
I mean, there's so many great ways for poking on there.

48:14.160 --> 48:15.160
He's nice.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.160
I'm serious, though.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.880
That guy is not the only guy that's programmed a game by himself.

48:18.880 --> 48:24.240
Hell, there's been people that have made a, I think, a whole anime movie by themselves,

48:24.240 --> 48:28.280
and you know, here are them bitching and stuff, and their movie gets made, and it looks fucking

48:28.280 --> 48:29.280
awesome.

48:29.280 --> 48:32.240
And I do want to clarify for the chatroom, because they were asking, even though Bob

48:32.240 --> 48:36.080
is banned from OLR, you can still say Bobby Blackwolf.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.080
That's okay.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.600
You can say it.

48:38.600 --> 48:39.840
It's part of a bigger word.

48:39.840 --> 48:42.900
It's just Bob as far as Bob's game, and you know.

48:42.900 --> 48:46.400
There might be a CEO or something of some company named Bob, and that's alright.

48:46.400 --> 48:50.040
And if Bob, Bobby Blackwolf makes a game, you can call it Bobby's Game.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.040
That's right.

48:51.040 --> 48:53.600
You can shorten it to Bob's Game, but you know, that doesn't really work.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.860
I would like to see Bobby Blackwolf put out a game called Bob's Game, and get it put on

48:56.860 --> 48:59.200
Xbox Live, and then sue the other Bob.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.200
That's what I would like to see happen.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.200
That'd be awesome.

49:01.200 --> 49:04.240
I'm gonna make an email to Bobby later on.

49:04.240 --> 49:08.200
Um, oh my god, LittleBigPlanet.

49:08.200 --> 49:10.920
You should do something making fun of Bob's Game on LittleBigPlanet.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.920
There you go.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.920
That'll be fun.

49:12.920 --> 49:13.920
We'll see.

49:13.920 --> 49:20.080
Um, I wanted to say also, AcidicVampire, sometimes our chatroom joins in on the FUs, and I don't

49:20.080 --> 49:22.880
always read in the mall, because then we'd be here for a day, but this just made me think

49:22.880 --> 49:25.560
of something that Rice Princess and I were talking about the other day.

49:25.560 --> 49:29.560
AcidicVampire in chat says, F you to those damn Snuggie commercials.

49:29.560 --> 49:35.000
It's a rope backwards!

49:35.000 --> 49:42.760
No, I, okay, for those that don't know what the Snuggie is, we have to talk about this

49:42.760 --> 49:44.680
for a minute, because this is important.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.680
The hell with video games.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.080
I want one of these for when I play video games.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.720
Buy a robe and turn it backwards.

49:50.720 --> 49:51.720
Done.

49:51.720 --> 49:57.000
The Snuggie is a blanket, but it has sleeves on it, because you know how sometimes like

49:57.000 --> 50:03.640
your arms are just like, they're under the blanket, and if you want to get some, then

50:03.640 --> 50:04.640
your arms get cold.

50:04.640 --> 50:05.640
Hypothermia.

50:05.640 --> 50:13.200
So the Snuggie fixes those problems, and I want one, because I get cold really easy.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.360
You're what's wrong with this nation.

50:15.360 --> 50:17.120
Yeah, it's so funny.

50:17.120 --> 50:20.360
When I saw the commercial the first time, I was like, what a great idea, but I'm not

50:20.360 --> 50:22.800
going to buy anything I see on TV, I'll just wait until it's a target.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.640
You know what else is a great idea?

50:24.640 --> 50:25.920
It's called a robe.

50:25.920 --> 50:26.920
Guess what?

50:26.920 --> 50:27.920
It also covers your back and your front.

50:27.920 --> 50:30.720
You make it sound like I'm always sitting around my house naked.

50:30.720 --> 50:33.800
I have clothes on, but sometimes you need an extra layer.

50:33.800 --> 50:34.800
Exactly.

50:34.800 --> 50:35.800
A sweater.

50:35.800 --> 50:41.080
Hey, I wore a robe with these clothes on right now because not only was it warm, it was comfortable.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.080
And guess what?

50:42.080 --> 50:45.240
It's not a fucking Snuggie that probably costs a lot of money.

50:45.240 --> 50:49.040
And they ripped off the Snuggie off of some other guy that had something very...

50:49.040 --> 50:50.040
The slinket.

50:50.040 --> 50:51.040
The slinket, yeah.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.040
Well, then I'll buy a slinket.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.960
I don't give a shit what the name is, I just want a blanket with sleeves.

50:54.960 --> 50:55.960
I think it's a brilliant idea.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.520
Did you see the what the fuck blanket, the parody?

50:58.520 --> 50:59.520
Yes, I saw that.

50:59.520 --> 51:00.520
You saw that, right?

51:00.520 --> 51:01.520
You posted on your live show or whatever.

51:01.520 --> 51:02.520
Yeah, that's right.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.000
That's like the best thing ever.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.120
And while we're at it, cashforgold.com is a complete ripoff, okay?

51:09.120 --> 51:14.600
If anyone can't figure that out, I mean, yeah, you send us your gold first, then I'll tell

51:14.600 --> 51:16.000
you how much it's worth.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.480
Yeah, we'll wait for you and everything.

51:18.480 --> 51:19.480
We'll give you a top...

51:19.480 --> 51:20.480
Really?

51:20.480 --> 51:21.480
Thanks.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.480
We'll give you a top dollar for it.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.920
Oh, and by the way, if you want your gold back, it's already melted down, so too bad.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.360
Tired of using regular blankets like this asshole?

51:27.360 --> 51:29.640
Do they somehow destroy your heating bills?

51:29.640 --> 51:32.160
Do you struggle when trying to figure out how to put them on?

51:32.160 --> 51:36.040
Are mundane tasks like answering the phone now impossibly difficult?

51:36.040 --> 51:39.600
Well morons, now there's hope with the new what the fuck blanket, the blanket that'll

51:39.600 --> 51:42.120
ruin your sex life.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.120
That's on YouTube.

51:43.120 --> 51:46.720
She looks like a monk.

51:46.720 --> 51:52.600
I think I actually posted a reply on Rice Princess' live journal with a picture of one

51:52.600 --> 51:55.800
of the happy, happy cultists, because it just reminded me, because they talk about how it

51:55.800 --> 51:58.200
looks like a cult robe or whatever.

51:58.200 --> 52:05.960
Somebody actually replied, my parents bought one for everyone in the household.

52:05.960 --> 52:10.560
That shit is on the ground in the corner.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.200
I like that idea.

52:12.200 --> 52:13.200
Give it to me.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.200
Don't let it sit in the corner.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.200
I was like, you should give it to Rob.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.200
He'd use it, I guess.

52:17.200 --> 52:18.200
All right.

52:18.200 --> 52:21.080
Anyhow, let's move on with more gaming news.

52:21.080 --> 52:22.080
Sorry for the...

52:22.080 --> 52:25.520
The only thing that I don't like about the robe, though, is it conducts a lot of static

52:25.520 --> 52:32.100
electricity, like a lot of static electricity, and it's not funny.

52:32.100 --> 52:33.280
And what about the ShamWow?

52:33.280 --> 52:34.840
That guy's annoying, too.

52:34.840 --> 52:37.200
But that's an actual product that's good.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.200
I mean...

52:38.200 --> 52:39.200
Well, I've never used it.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.200
I don't know.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.200
Whatever happened to Sillet Bang?

52:41.200 --> 52:42.200
That's...

52:42.200 --> 52:43.200
Sillet Bang?

52:43.200 --> 52:44.200
Where's the magic bullet?

52:44.200 --> 52:45.200
It's like orange glow or something.

52:45.200 --> 52:46.200
All right.

52:46.200 --> 52:47.200
Enough.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.200
Enough.

52:48.200 --> 52:49.200
Games.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.200
Video games.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.200
Games.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.200
Games.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.200
Games.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.200
Anyways, Gears of War PC.

52:54.200 --> 52:57.240
I don't know, because there was a little problem.

52:57.240 --> 53:03.320
Apparently, there is a Verisign code that has expired.

53:03.320 --> 53:07.880
And because it expired, the game will not work past the date January 28th.

53:07.880 --> 53:12.320
So if you want to play it, you have to set your date back to before the 28th, and then

53:12.320 --> 53:14.080
it'll work just fine.

53:14.080 --> 53:19.560
Epic is aware of the situation, and is working on a way to fix it.

53:19.560 --> 53:21.000
So soon, it'll be fixed.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.280
But right now, it's a minor inconvenience.

53:25.280 --> 53:28.080
That's a pretty fucking big inconvenience, actually.

53:28.080 --> 53:31.480
What if you just got this game, like, in the bargain bin at a store or something, and now

53:31.480 --> 53:32.480
you can't even play the damn thing?

53:32.480 --> 53:34.800
Well, then you would go online, read about it, and set your date back to before the 28th.

53:34.800 --> 53:36.760
What if I'm not smart enough to do that?

53:36.760 --> 53:38.440
Well, then, too bad.

53:38.440 --> 53:42.320
Then you go back and take it back to Walmart and go, it's game no work, and then they'll

53:42.320 --> 53:43.320
give you your money back.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.320
Can you give me a Snuggie instead?

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
That's right.

53:45.320 --> 53:49.760
Maybe I would take back my copies of Gears of War PC and get a Snuggie.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.440
They should have a Gears of War Snuggie.

53:51.440 --> 53:53.960
They should have a Gears of War Snuggie.

53:53.960 --> 53:54.960
That would be awful.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.920
They should have Snuggies that have, like, patterns on them, like, Sesame Street and

53:57.920 --> 53:58.920
all this.

53:58.920 --> 53:59.920
Sesame Street?

53:59.920 --> 54:02.440
You know, all the stuff from, you know, when we were kids.

54:02.440 --> 54:03.440
Yes.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.440
Totally.

54:04.440 --> 54:08.120
Or you could make your own out of a blanket.

54:08.120 --> 54:11.680
But with sleeves, Loki, you're missing the point.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.320
It needs sleeves.

54:13.320 --> 54:14.760
I have an idea.

54:14.760 --> 54:17.880
Why don't you get pajamas?

54:17.880 --> 54:18.880
Or a jacket.

54:18.880 --> 54:19.880
Or a robe.

54:19.880 --> 54:22.320
Pajamas make me feel old.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.560
Or like some socks.

54:23.560 --> 54:25.720
What are you saying about pajamas, okay?

54:25.720 --> 54:29.160
I have a pair of flannel pajamas that are fucking comfortable, okay?

54:29.160 --> 54:30.240
And they're warm.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.240
And they're warm.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.240
Alright, look.

54:32.240 --> 54:37.440
Gears of War didn't just make the mistake of not making a Snuggie out of their collection

54:37.440 --> 54:40.200
or flubbing the PC version of the game.

54:40.200 --> 54:47.400
Apparently, also, the Gears of War 2 Gold Lancer went up on Xbox Live for everybody

54:47.400 --> 54:48.400
earlier this week.

54:48.400 --> 54:51.080
This was something you were only supposed to get if you actually got the collector's

54:51.080 --> 54:52.920
edition of Gears of War 2.

54:52.920 --> 54:55.400
And when I say Gold Lancer, I don't mean a car.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.400
It's the type of gun.

54:56.400 --> 54:58.920
It's the type of gun that you use in the game.

54:58.920 --> 55:04.980
Although it would be pretty awesome if you suddenly could use cars to run over the monsters.

55:04.980 --> 55:06.480
And here's the other interesting thing about it.

55:06.480 --> 55:11.960
According to a representative for Xbox Live, everybody who actually got the Gold Lancer

55:11.960 --> 55:15.920
during the period that it was available, they're gonna have the item removed from the game

55:15.920 --> 55:17.480
in an upcoming fix.

55:17.480 --> 55:18.480
Right.

55:18.480 --> 55:23.160
Just like they said the Fable 2 exclusive code or whatever for people to have the collector's

55:23.160 --> 55:24.160
edition.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.560
We're gonna find out who doesn't have the collector's edition.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.600
We're gonna take it away from you.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.560
Yeah, that never happened.

55:30.560 --> 55:34.600
Apparently, also, the way they fixed this temporarily, they put the Gold Lancer...

55:34.600 --> 55:37.760
I mean, they weren't able to remove the Gold Lancer from Xbox Live Marketplace.

55:37.760 --> 55:44.360
Apparently, it was still there late last week, but it was being charged a price of 99,999

55:44.360 --> 55:45.360
Microsoft points.

55:45.360 --> 55:46.360
They do that.

55:46.360 --> 55:47.360
They do that.

55:47.360 --> 55:49.720
They did that before because they actually have that available and then there's also

55:49.720 --> 55:53.880
some maps that were for Call of Duty World at War that were exclusive.

55:53.880 --> 55:59.200
This was when they first launched that Xbox.com where you can actually queue up downloads

55:59.200 --> 56:00.380
and stuff like that.

56:00.380 --> 56:02.080
They had a way that if you go through...

56:02.080 --> 56:06.800
Say you downloaded this Gold Lancer or whatever, you can go back into your history, find out

56:06.800 --> 56:11.920
what the item or the URL is for the item posted on the internet, then anybody can go download

56:11.920 --> 56:13.960
it or go to that link.

56:13.960 --> 56:20.360
If it happened to be a free item, you'll be able to download it onto your system or something

56:20.360 --> 56:21.360
like that.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.360
Something that would be exclusive.

56:22.360 --> 56:24.000
They did this originally with...

56:24.000 --> 56:28.600
There was also the Banjo-Kazooie thing, the Xbox Live Arcade game that was available only

56:28.600 --> 56:29.600
for a limited time.

56:29.600 --> 56:34.680
However, they caught that too and they also put it, like, 99,999 as the amount for it.

56:34.680 --> 56:39.280
You have to wonder if anybody spends the $150,000 or whatever it would take to get it anyway.

56:39.280 --> 56:43.680
Well, there are people that buy stupid iPhone programs that cost thousands of dollars just

56:43.680 --> 56:45.840
to have a stupid gem on there.

56:45.840 --> 56:46.840
So...

56:46.840 --> 56:47.840
Wow.

56:47.840 --> 56:48.840
That's pretty sad.

56:48.840 --> 56:49.840
Yeah.

56:49.840 --> 56:50.840
I don't know.

56:50.840 --> 56:53.800
I wish I had disposable income like that, but I don't.

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
You don't?

56:54.800 --> 56:58.420
Well, if you did, then you could probably buy some of these new Xbox Live Arcade games

56:58.420 --> 57:00.120
coming from Square Enix.

57:00.120 --> 57:04.320
Of course, we talked about Yosamin Live, their puzzle game that's coming out with a little

57:04.320 --> 57:05.320
angry...

57:05.320 --> 57:07.240
I don't know, objects in there.

57:07.240 --> 57:12.400
They have a little slime object that's kind of angry looking and a cross that looks angry.

57:12.400 --> 57:14.120
It's a whole lot of angry stuff.

57:14.120 --> 57:17.840
Actually, it's like, you know, like in Super Mario Brothers how everything has a smiley

57:17.840 --> 57:18.840
face on it?

57:18.840 --> 57:22.480
Everything has an angry face in this game, so that's interesting.

57:22.480 --> 57:26.120
Some other games, of course, that are going to be coming as well.

57:26.120 --> 57:29.740
The Crystal Defenders, which, of course, was originally a mobile game.

57:29.740 --> 57:32.680
Some other stuff...

57:32.680 --> 57:35.560
There are some other games that they're working on too that I didn't really mention the titles

57:35.560 --> 57:36.600
for, though.

57:36.600 --> 57:40.880
But they do have a lot more ports coming to Xbox Live Arcade and Square Enix is going

57:40.880 --> 57:43.600
to start supporting it a little bit more.

57:43.600 --> 57:44.600
So that's cool.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.320
I don't really know what other games they have.

57:46.320 --> 57:50.440
They had a game a while back in Itremaster.

57:50.440 --> 57:51.440
That would be kind of neat.

57:51.440 --> 57:52.440
Yeah, for Xbox Live.

57:52.440 --> 57:54.440
That would be fun, right?

57:54.440 --> 57:55.440
Yeah.

57:55.440 --> 57:57.380
I wonder if they're still making money on that.

57:57.380 --> 57:58.380
You know what I mean?

57:58.380 --> 57:59.380
Like the online version?

57:59.380 --> 58:00.380
Nah, I doubt it.

58:00.380 --> 58:03.400
I mean, it's kind of free money at this point if they do have anybody playing it.

58:03.400 --> 58:07.200
I mean, I'm sure it takes like one server to run the whole thing, but, you know, they

58:07.200 --> 58:10.400
could release that as like a $10 Xbox Live Arcade game, maybe when you have to charge

58:10.400 --> 58:12.960
a monthly fee and they still make a pretty penny off it.

58:12.960 --> 58:15.780
They had a game, and I can't remember what the hell it was called.

58:15.780 --> 58:21.000
It was, and I'm not even sure if it actually came out, but it was for, I think, the Playstation

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
2.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.080
Might have been the Playstation 1.

58:24.080 --> 58:29.000
And it was on a demo disc that was, I think it was the Playstation 1 now, if I remember

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
correctly.

58:30.000 --> 58:35.480
It was on a demo disc with like, I want to say, maybe if it had been Final Fantasy 7,

58:35.480 --> 58:39.680
there might have been some other stuff on there as well.

58:39.680 --> 58:43.480
But it was a street racing RPG.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.820
But I don't remember what it was called, though.

58:45.820 --> 58:50.160
But I remember it had, you know, like racing in it, and it was from Square Enix.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.160
I don't remember either.

58:51.160 --> 58:54.080
But that would be another cool game to bring out.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.080
Who knows?

58:55.080 --> 58:56.080
Who knows?

58:56.080 --> 58:59.520
And I'm sure there'll be some type of Final Fantasy milking at some point, which is not

58:59.520 --> 59:00.520
necessarily a bad thing.

59:00.520 --> 59:02.680
Well, they do have Crystal Defenders, which is a Final Fantasy game, so.

59:02.680 --> 59:04.680
Alright, I guess there is that.

59:04.680 --> 59:10.040
Hey, if you are downloading a lot of stuff on Xbox Live Marketplace for popular role-playing

59:10.040 --> 59:14.000
games, perhaps you've checked out some of the content for Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.360
And Bethesda actually put out a list this week of what some of the top downloaded Oblivion

59:18.360 --> 59:19.920
content is.

59:19.920 --> 59:25.240
And funny enough, the top downloaded content is Wizard's Tower, is the number one most

59:25.240 --> 59:27.640
downloaded content that they have.

59:27.640 --> 59:32.280
Knights of the Nine is all the way down to number seven, Shivering Isles number eight.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.560
But what's interesting, I mean, because those are pretty expensive if I remember right,

59:35.560 --> 59:40.640
but what's interesting, remember all the shit that Bethesda used to get for the horse armor?

59:40.640 --> 59:42.880
Remember the horse armor download they put?

59:42.880 --> 59:46.920
Apparently that content, all it was, like where is all this other content I'm mentioning

59:46.920 --> 59:51.580
is like new levels, new areas to explore, new quests and stuff.

59:51.580 --> 59:54.440
Horse armor was just armor for your horse.

59:54.440 --> 59:57.080
And it was just a visual thing only, it did nothing special.

59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.360
Because yeah, so and they actually charged a lot of money for this.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.600
It was like, at the time, it was an insane amount, I don't remember how much was horse

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.600
armor?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600
It was like five bucks, I think.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.440
It was like five bucks for stupid armor for your horse.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:11.800
Well the thing is, that checks in at number nine.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.920
And they claim they still sell some horse armor every day.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920
Wow.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.960
Still, even after all this time.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:23.560
Fighter's Stronghold is the dead last entry on the top ten list.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.960
You can get Elder Scrolls Oblivion the game of the year edition with the expansion on

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
it.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.260
20 bucks.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.260
Not bad.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.160
I'm thinking about buying it again.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.600
For Playstation 3?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600
Fuck that.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600
Who knows?

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600
Xbox 360.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600
I didn't catch which system it was on.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.760
No, the game of the year edition is on both.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.080
So both of them are 20 bucks now.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.920
Fighter's Stronghold is dead last.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.600
Apparently though, that could be because this thing only ranks the bot download and pay

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600
for it.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.120
And Fighter's Stronghold was free for a little while, that's why I have it.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.400
So probably a lot of people grabbed it while it was free and they never needed to get it

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.400
again.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:02.400
But was it an Xbox Magazine disc that actually has two of those on there that were paid download

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.880
content for free?

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.880
If you want them.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.960
I don't know if you still play Oblivion, but you know.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.760
There's just so much to do in Oblivion.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.000
I mean, god, even without the expansions, I felt like they could, I mean, literally

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.840
you can just walk around the world and just walk into random ass dungeons and explore

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840
them.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.840
I mean, there was just so much in that game.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:20.840
I, it's crazy.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.280
I can't wait for the next one.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.840
It'd be crazy.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.160
So there you go.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:30.520
Still all that content for Oblivion is still popular today?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.060
Something that's popular, I think, is still Raiden.

01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:39.800
You may remember those as the wonderful top-down arcade shooter games.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.280
Well, Raiden Fighter Aces, I believe, came out in Japan, and it's rumored to be coming

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.680
out over here as well.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.680
Raiden Fighter Aces actually is a collection of three different Raiden Fighter games.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.120
They have Raiden Fighters, Raiden Fighters 2, Operation Helldive, and Raiden Fighter's

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.080
Jet, all on one disc.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:08.800
Well, the rumors are that Zoo Games is actually publishing the game in the US for $29.99,

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.680
and that's absolutely true, and it'll be coming out the first week of March.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.720
Also, Raiden 4 will be coming out around the same time, actually later in March.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.480
So a lot of good stuff for Raiden fans.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.920
And GS68 wants to clarify two things.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920
He's saying Raiden.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.980
Raiden, Raiden, whatever.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.800
And Mortal Kombat kind of ruined it, because they called that one guy Raiden, forget it,

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.920
and says all of this is Japanese-only, right?

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.920
No.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:35.920
It's coming stateside.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.080
These are coming out in the US.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.080
And what platform?

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.080
Xbox 360.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.560
There you go.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.360
And yeah, Raiden 4 will be coming out at the end of March.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.360
Nice.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.680
I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that are very interested in that.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:56.000
Also some folks interested in everything Banjo Kazooie related, and there's Banjo Tooie.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.880
Banjo Tooie is going to be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, apparently a little later this

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880
year.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.560
Probably about 1,200 Microsoft points, although that hasn't been confirmed yet.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.220
But it is confirmed.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.520
It is coming out.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.400
It's slightly upped graphics and upped frame rate as well.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.640
And Stop and Swap is coming over.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.200
Apparently this is something from the Nintendo 64 days, where if you got some items in Banjo

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:24.400
Kazooie, they will show up in Banjo Tooie as well.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.760
So not too big of a surprise, since I'm assuming the first one did pretty well for them, and

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760
the game was already done.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.400
They just have to do some upgrades and sell it all over again for $15, and people will

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.400
buy it.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:38.680
Where there's horse armor, there's Banjo Tooie.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.080
Okay, maybe it's not that bad.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.080
But you know, there's a lot of people who love the Banjo series, and I'm sure excited

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.480
to play it all over again with the updated graphics and widescreen and all that stuff.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480
So good for them.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.200
Yeah, well, if you're not waiting for Banjo Tooie, there are some other things coming

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.120
out this week.

01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:59.680
That might be something you want to pick up.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.200
I don't know, not a whole lot this week, unfortunately.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.560
Starting things off, let's see.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:12.320
We have, for the Wii, Rygar Battle of Argus.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.320
Yay.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:20.920
I don't know, it's a port of the Playstation 2 game, and then they've added some Colosseum

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.280
levels or something like that.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.160
So yay, a port of something!

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.360
That came out like, what, five years ago?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.440
Yeah, it was a while ago.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.800
So that'll be coming out.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:40.360
And then this week, I know there's some miscellaneous DS games, like some Imagine crap.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.560
Imagine, crapping.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:51.160
No, it's really pathetic, the lineup this week, I swear.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.440
And then, could that be because we have Street Fighter IV coming out the week after, or is

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440
that two weeks?

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440
It's two weeks.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.440
Yeah, two weeks.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.560
Actually, the week after would be Fear 2, and X-Planes.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.640
Oh, there's people definitely excited about that.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640
That's for sure.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640
Yeah.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.320
Street Fighter II is next week in Japan, but I'll get to that in a minute.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.600
Oh, are you done with the US states?

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.960
This list that I'm looking at is not very accurate, it actually doesn't even have next

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960
week.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.960
It just skips over next week, that's how pathetic next week is.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:29.920
I'm trying to think if there's, I think Tenchu Z, or not Tenchu Z yet, Tenchu 4 on the Wii

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.000
is coming out I believe as well, at least I can't remember if that got delayed or not.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.560
Yeah, so it's basically Tenchu or nothing.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:46.800
This whole January-February period is usually pretty slow for game releases.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.180
The Street Fighter IV thing is kind of a, I get the sense it's something Capcom is kind

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.960
of trying out.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.160
Usually you don't see a lot of big, big games in this time frame, right?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.280
Actually, Capcom typically releases stuff in the first quarter.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.280
Interesting.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.680
Actually, this year they're releasing stuff first quarter and second quarter, which is

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.480
good.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.440
But they are pretty smart to do so, because there's not much competition this time of

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.440
year.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.600
Although this year there's pretty good stuff coming out.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.840
But yeah, not too much, this next week is really dead.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:20.600
So we'll wait for the week after that where we actually get into the meat of things, and

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.440
it'll start picking up from there all the way through March.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.960
Alright, let's talk about Japanese release dates.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.920
Luckily it looks a little better over there for the Japanese release dates.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.920
On the Xbox 360, Burnout Paradise, the Ultimate Box set, makes this way, and I'm assuming

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:36.600
that's just all the special download stuff we got here.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:42.120
It's the Burnout plus the ultimate party thing that they've got that's going to be a download

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.120
next week.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.120
Basically all the extra crap.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.640
You can get that in Japan this week on February the 5th for the Xbox 360.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.220
Also, Midnight Club Los Angeles comes out on the 5th.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:55.120
If you head over to the place, it's racing fun on the Xbox 360 this week.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:00.160
By the way, Street Fighter IV is next week, but I'll remind you about that next week.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.360
On the PlayStation 3, Burnout Paradise, the Ultimate Box also there, as well as Midnight

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.360
Club Los Angeles.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.580
You also get Shaun White snowboarding, and Demon's Souls is a game that's coming out

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.000
from Sony on the PlayStation 3.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.780
It's... what are you laughing at over there?

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.400
And Demon's Souls you get.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.360
It's apparently a pretty big release.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.480
It's an RPG coming out.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.000
Demon's Souls!

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.480
I sure... but... shut up.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.640
For that, I'm not going to tell you anything more about Demon's Souls.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640
You'll just have to.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640
It will forever be a mystery.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.640
Oh, no.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640
No, please, Rob.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640
Tells you about Demon's Souls.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640
Well, it's an RPG made by Sony.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.640
I think it's pretty... alright.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:42.160
On the Nintendo Wii, another code R. Kyoku no Tobira is coming out from Nintendo.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.440
D-Terminal and AV-Cable.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.440
That's right.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.800
If you need a new AV-Cable, you can get that this week.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.280
Well, D-Terminal's pretty cool.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.160
I've been waiting for years for that to come out.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.160
Finally.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.160
Well, the D-Terminal's cool because, I mean, you know, if you want to hook it up to a PC

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.120
monitor, that's the only way you can do it, really.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:03.200
I've got to say, though, this another code R game actually sounds kind of cool.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.400
Is this just Lost in Blue?

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.920
No, it's just Trace Memory.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.160
Oh, it's Trace Memory.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.960
Oh, okay, because I got confused when I looked at the thing.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.960
This game actually sounds kind of cool.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.960
The first one was really slow.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.960
You know what's weird?

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.960
I thought that game has been out for a while.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960
No, it's just coming out of the game.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.840
At least I've seen it floating around for a while, but, you know, I could be wrong.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.840
I've been thinking of the DS version.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.840
I think you are.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:22.840
Yeah, I think you are.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.360
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, nothing.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.840
There's one game getting a price reduction, Momotaro Densetsu 16.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:29.840
That's it.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.400
And nothing else is new.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.680
Nintendo DS is a little different.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.180
There is some new stuff coming out, but it's mostly like covers and pouches and things

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.180
like that.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.960
But there is a game called Destiny Links coming out from Bandai Namco, and it's an RPG, of

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.960
course.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:50.560
And you get your character and you sail forth to Amazia, the island of happiness.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.080
That sounds like a destiny I want.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.080
I'm not making it up.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.800
Can't wait to get to Amazia.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.800
Amazia.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.920
I believe that's it.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.480
I'm trying to look at PSP really quick and see if there's anything there.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.920
Midnight Club LA Remix, Shaun White Snowboarding, and DJ Max Fever, by the way, is supposed

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920
to be coming out in the US.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.640
I think it did already hit the US, but it got delayed some places because of the snowstorms

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.640
that were going on, right?

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.280
Yeah, fucking ice storms.

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.600
Some people got their hands on it.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.560
Hey, let's go to Europe real quick.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.840
Since Jamie's not here tonight, I'll go ahead and read the Europe dates for you.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.560
Now, see, Japan and the US were kind of slow, but Europe has a big week ahead.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.960
For February 6th, they're getting Burnout Paradise on the PC, Castlevania Order of Aclatia

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.000
on the DS, Chrono Trigger finally hits on the DS for those folks in Europe, Gauntlet

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.980
on the DS, Lost in Blue 3 on the DS, New Play Control Peekman comes out on the Wii, Raven

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:53.280
Squad hits the Xbox 360 and PC, Rise of the Argonauts hits PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, Shell

01:09:53.280 --> 01:10:00.960
Shock 2, fucking tongue twister, Shell Shock 2 Blood Trails comes out on 360, PS3 and PC,

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:04.360
and Walk With Me, do you know your walking routine on the DS?

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.680
Do you know that you're walking right now?

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:11.920
Isn't it funny that even when we get the crap game, so do Europe, but when we get a great

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.520
game like Chrono Trigger, they have to wait like three months for it.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520
You poor guys.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520
Well, they got Pikmin.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.320
See, they're gonna get the port of Pikmin now, and we're gonna get the new Zelda months

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.600
before they will.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.600
Yeah.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:25.600
That's fair.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.600
Go Nintendo.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:27.600
I'm sorry.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.840
Boy oh boy.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:35.320
You know what else is equally awesome as, you know, delays and stuff like that?

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:43.280
Rock band receiving some brand new tracks from Nickelodeon's High School Musical-esque

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:51.200
movie, Spectacular, yes, there's two songs from the film, Break My Heart and Don't Tell

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.200
Me.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:58.160
They're both available for the equivalent of one dollar on your Xbox Live Marketplace

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.640
or PlayStation Network.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:09.720
And of course, if you happen to wait until March 31st for the DVD release of Spectacular,

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.040
there will also be a redemption code for a free download of the two songs via the rock

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.220
band music store.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:33.920
And if you're curious what this sounds like, it's not terrible.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920
Yes, it is.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.720
I don't think I'd pay money for it though.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.480
It's not terrible, but it is terrible.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.480
Shut up.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.160
It's interesting how diverse rock band is getting, I mean, we have the country stuff

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.360
and now we get the tween stuff.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:54.880
The thing is, it's not anything that you have to download, but I do appreciate the option

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.680
of being able to download something like this, because that means that they can release other

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.960
things that are of other genres that, you know, may appeal to me a little bit more.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.400
I mean, at least they're willing to put it up there, then to just say, oh, we're just

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.900
going to put out more, you know.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:14.800
The entire chat room is crying out in pain at what we just played, especially because

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.520
you won't hear this on the podcast because the podcasts are mono sound, but when it played

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.080
live, that YouTube, for whatever reason, was left channel only.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:25.460
So people are like, ah, my right ear is bleeding.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:33.120
By the way, you have your headset on backwards because that YouTube was left channel only.

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.960
Dark Tetsuya pours bleach on his speakers, Leo Shen, my ears are bleeding now, damn it.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.760
Alright fine, I guess there's not a lot of people that are going to be downloading the

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.160
Spectacular songs.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.960
But it's spectacular.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.120
But it's spectacular.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:51.520
Also Spectacular is a segment we like to do here every week on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.040
We like to pay a little respect to the classic games, and it's a little segment we do here

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.720
on the show called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.760
Of course, Dark Soccer is the one that usually does this segment, but she's not here tonight,

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.200
so we have no game that she picked.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.080
I decided to pick one for us, but you know, I kind of picked one collectively for all

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.200
of us to kind of match, you know, there is a certain something going on right now in

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.200
the world, you know, there's that big game, I guess they throw a ball around and all this

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200
stuff.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.320
No, no, of course, we are taping the same day as the Super Bowl, and when you talk football

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:30.480
and you talk video games, there really is one classic video game you have to recognize,

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.440
and that is this week's Classic Game of the Week.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.760
Blades of Steel.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.760
No.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:38.360
Tecmo Bowl is this week's Classic Game of the Week.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.760
Yay.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:47.440
That's right, the wonderful 8-bit sounds of Tecmo Bowl on the NES.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.520
I chose purposefully not to do Tecmo Super Bowl tonight, I did Tecmo Bowl, the old school

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.440
game, because this is, you know, a little more of a classic, and this is, I played this

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:01.240
game a hell of a lot growing up, you know, and I know we like to think that Rob plays

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.360
like no sports games and hates them all, but there are a few, few and far between that

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.520
will come along once in a while to get my attention, and Tecmo Bowl was one of them.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.280
So let's learn a little bit about Tecmo Bowl.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.280
Tecmo Bowl was actually based off an arcade game, an arcade version of Tecmo Bowl.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.200
I should be noted, that's not what we're citing as the Classic Game of the Week, because I've

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:23.000
played the arcade version in a compilation that was on the Xbox, Tecmo Classic Arcade,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.280
and it stinks compared to the one on the NES.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:28.560
It doesn't seem to move as quickly, I just don't care for it.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:32.880
So Tecmo Bowl on the NES is our Classic Game of the Week.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.720
You've probably seen this before, it was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 12, 2007,

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:44.440
but the original came out in 1989 after the original arcade version was released in 1987.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.640
The arcade version had this big two monitor setup so that four people could play, but

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.600
the NES version was way scaled down because it was only two players.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.640
You could do three modes, one player, two player, or just a coach mode where you would

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.760
pick all the plays.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:03.040
The playbook only has four offensive plays, or if you're on defense, you kind of try to

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.000
pick the play that you think the offense is going to pick, and you did it with this combination

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.480
of the controller and the buttons.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.800
Tecmo Bowl isn't a perfect game though, it was a little better than Ten Yard Fight, which

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.600
was one of the only other football games that was out at the time.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.800
Apparently almost any pass that you throw to a covered receiver is going to end up an

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.320
interception.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.620
If you use the New York Giants, and you use Lawrence Taylor, apparently you can pretty

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:31.680
much block almost all kicks, and apparently San Francisco has a play that is usually unstoppable

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.720
against almost any defense, and I used to win every time with San Francisco and I think

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.000
that's probably why.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.560
By the way, you wouldn't actually be playing as the New York Giants though in the game

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.280
because they didn't have the licensing from the NFL to actually use the names of the teams,

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.200
so when you selected teams, you were just Indianapolis, or San Francisco, or New York.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.920
But it was weird, they had certain teams in the game but not certain others.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.640
For instance, you don't have, you know, the Steelers.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:05.640
I don't know if that has to do with the whole NFL layup, I don't know, forget it.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:10.120
But anyway, I don't know enough about football to understand the whole thing behind that,

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:15.360
but you do get the players, and they are all in the game, and you know, it was the old

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.960
8-bit NES days, they didn't really look any different, it's just that you had the different

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.960
names.

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.120
However, if you downloaded this on the Virtual Console version, you didn't get the names

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.800
because the licensing had expired, so they actually removed all the names from the version

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.520
that came out for Virtual Console, which kind of stinks, if you think about it.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.160
By the way, there was also a version on mobile phones that was released in 2004, and apparently

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.600
they are bringing this series back.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:41.920
Tecmo Bowl Kickoff, I don't know if this came out yet, but that was supposed to be coming

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.440
out on the DS, but I don't know if that ever did actually come out, or is still on its

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.720
way out, but I think it, I can't remember if it came out in November or not, it was

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.000
originally going to come out in November.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.880
You know what, it just, it just isn't the old school 8-bit version, so, you know, and

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.080
I know there's a lot of people very partial to Tecmo Super Bowl, but I just, I have to

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.720
take a minute to just recognize the greatness of the classic NES version, you're actually

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.720
nodding your head, Rice Princess.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.720
Uh, yes, it did come out.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720
Oh, it did come out?

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720
When did it come out?

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.320
Uh, not too long ago, but it's available for 20 bucks.

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.320
There you go.

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.320
Apparently it just price dropped.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.200
Rice Princess, were you a fan of Tecmo Bowl?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200
No.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200
No?

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.200
Okay.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.200
Were there any sports games that you played?

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:31.680
Um, I liked this about Tecmo Bowl too, was that it had like little cinematics, when you

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.200
had to touch down, it was like high five and super slow motion because we don't really

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:41.080
have movies, and this halftime show, whoa, I know, cinematic halftime show is pretty

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.080
awesome.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.760
It's like Ninja Gaiden, but with the ball, I was nodding my head because I'm concurring

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:54.880
with your point about like, um, paying homage to like the older original versions and stuff

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880
like that.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.480
Personally, if I were to pick a, you know, an NFL game that was going to be my, um, you

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.120
know, pick for something like this today, NFL Blitz, I knew it.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.480
All right, fair enough.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.240
Maybe next year, maybe during next Super Bowl, we'll see.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.240
But that's it for now.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.960
It's your classic game of the week, Tecmo Bowl here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.920
And with that, it's going to bring part A of our show to a close tonight, but don't

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.000
go anywhere because we're going to be just right back in a few seconds with part B. If

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.960
you're listening on the podcast, it only takes a few seconds.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.960
You hear that little doo, doo, doo, doo, and then it's right back into part B. But if you're

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.440
listening live, this is the point where we, uh, take a little bit longer of a break to,

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:37.920
you know, get a drink of water, use the restroom, toilet bowl, not the toilet Super Bowl.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.160
And this will actually be, it's very special this week, our break, because this will be

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:46.440
try to restrain a rice princess from my Xbox 360 for 10 minutes during the break.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.480
So we'll see how that works.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:59.040
We'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.920
Hi and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:03.920
1st of 2009.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.160
You know, there's a big football game going on today, but we're here doing a show anyway.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160
It's over actually.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.160
The Steelers won.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.160
Apparently it was really exciting.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.680
I guess there was like a, a big run to a touchdown or things like, you can totally tell.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.240
I don't know dick about football when you play football, although I do love tech mobile

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.560
as you saw there at the end of part a, but we're back now with more of Orange Lounge

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.360
Radio and we have a plenty more news stories to get to dark soccer is not here tonight

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.360
if you're just tuning in.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.000
Cause we've had people slowly tuning as, as people realize it's over on the game.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.440
Uh, we have more and more people slowly tuning in tonight.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.440
Dark soccer is not here tonight.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.240
She has some family errands to take care of and lovely Prosser Washington, which I think

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.960
is towards the South of Washington.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.960
I'm not sure.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:45.960
I don't live there.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.800
Um, but she's, she's not that close to Seattle.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.800
That's what she told me.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.160
It's not that close to Seattle.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.800
Um, but we're still here.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.160
Rice princess is here tonight, uh, helping to fill in and give us some sarcasm and wit

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.480
as she usually does, or at least attempts to do.

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.520
And silent Nathan is also here, but he wouldn't know cause he doesn't say much, but he is

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.840
here wearing his hoard hat, uh, showing his pride for the hoard.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.840
I'm wearing my Alliance sweater.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.920
Oh, do you two like fight for real over?

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920
Awesome.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.100
Oh, too bad we don't have a webcam, but we will have it next week.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.720
Cause there's a cord coming from New Jersey.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:18.720
I found out.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:19.720
Woo.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.720
Woo hoo.

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:22.840
All right, let's get back into some gaming news.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.960
Loki's here to deliver the news as always.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.960
What's up, Loki?

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:26.960
Uh, not much.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.320
Um, there will be some new download content coming out for the new Prince of Persia game.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.480
Um, this takes place after the end of the game.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:40.200
It's going to be the epilogue download content and it will kind of further develop the relationship

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:45.400
between the two main characters and also have them, um, you know, going after our new enemy,

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.400
the shape shifter.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:48.320
Are they going to do it yet?

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.560
I don't think so.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.640
And then it's apparently the shape shifter is an enemy that takes the form of two of

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.120
Eremon's most fearsome lieutenants, the warrior and the hunter.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:02.760
And it's as though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:06.720
It will require a particular strategy to defeat the shape shifter, rewarding the player that

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:10.600
takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the epilogue.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.480
Will I get to have more conversations with the chick that always saves me from falling

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.480
to my death?

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.480
Uh, possibly.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.480
Awesome.

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:22.360
And, uh, of course, you know, they're going to have the sprinting offensive and Elika

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:27.480
is going to get the new energized power, which will allow her to temporarily, um, temporarily

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.560
restore a piece of destroyed environment.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560
Huh.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.720
That'd be interesting.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:37.480
Will, uh, will the game still help me every step of the way by telling me what buttons

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480
to push?

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.480
Maybe.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.480
Awesome.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.600
Uh, the download content will be available though on February 26th.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.160
All right.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.160
Check that out.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160
How much do they have price for that?

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160
No price yet.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:50.560
So, uh, somewhere between five and $10.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.560
I'm guessing.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:57.220
Well, something that does have a price, a pretty high price, 8,190 yen, they are going

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.220
to charge to this.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:00.020
That's 90 American dollars.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:05.680
They are charging for the last remnant on PC, and this is according to Famitsu Magazine.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.600
There is a PC port of the last remnant.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.520
This was a role playing game that was put on the Xbox 360.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.200
They hit kind of mixed reviews.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.360
Um, some of our listeners have been saying pretty favorable things about this.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.040
I haven't checked this game out myself yet.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:21.160
Um, but if you don't own an Xbox 360 and you want to check this out on PC, um, you might

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:25.120
be in luck because it is coming in Japan on April 9th, but it is going to have that pretty

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:26.120
high price tag.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.960
And then when you count importing fees on top of that or what have you, although of

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.960
course, I'm sure if you wanted to go to darker places on the internet, you could probably

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:32.960
get it for free.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.960
Um, but I don't know, you know, it's going to be all in Japanese, so who knows?

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.160
Um, apparently though, it's going to actually give you some extra stuff in the PC version.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.720
You can speed up battle animations now.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.880
Um, it will have more leader class characters.

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.960
You can preview equipment in the menu and you can actually switch between Japanese and

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.960
English.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.080
So maybe you won't need to patch much more than the menus to get this.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.360
So, and Rama is in chat and says it's a great game.

01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:01.840
He says, last remnant, great game at comment coming from our chat room, chat dot orange

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:02.840
launch radio.com.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.440
If you're just joining us post super bowl, you should come join us as long as it's easier

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.120
to install and have run than grand theft auto four.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.360
By the way, one other quick thing I want to say about this game.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.160
This is the game that a square enix took the unreal engine for.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.200
Remember you might remember a few years back, there was a big news story that square enix

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.200
had purchased the unreal engine for something.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.280
This is that game.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:27.160
So you can see it in motion on the PC in the last remnant.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:32.400
Apparently it was un-really disappointing.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.240
That's a mixed mixed bag, mixed bag of opinions.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.240
Yeah.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.720
Well, something that might be a little bit better, hopefully are some sequels to some

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.980
well known capcom franchises.

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:50.240
There was some talk about brand new dead rising game and a lost planet game and that they

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:54.300
may possibly be multi platform.

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:59.200
This of course is coming from an issue of Famitsu magazine with an interview with the

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:06.520
capcom executive Kenji Inafune and of course he mentioned of course new dead rising lost

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.520
planet games.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.840
I mean, not a big surprise since you know capcom dead rising did very well for them

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:17.660
and you know they're making a lost planet movie for god's sake so not a big surprise

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:22.240
that we'll see some new games and the fact that they'll be multi platform is not a shock

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.240
either.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.440
Cool, hopefully those are soon.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.940
Hopefully we'll see those at E3.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.440
It's interesting to think about what kinds of stuff we're really going to see come out

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.640
of E3 this year because there's been a lot of, it's been fairly quiet all things considered.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.160
I'm thinking this year's E3 is going to be pretty big especially with the whole return

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:44.520
to E3's roots even though they say not really but you know that whole thing.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.520
We'll see.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.500
Also, but capcom is all about the multi porting too so I'm sure if these things are coming

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.360
out they're going to be everywhere on every platform right?

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.720
There you go.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.100
Alright let's see, let's talk about Bioshock 2 another game that's probably going to get

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.560
some attention at E3.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.800
I'm almost positive they've got to be showing more of this game at E3 this year.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.440
Bioshock 2 the Sea of Dreams, or I'm sorry Sea of Dreams there's no V in there.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:14.040
But Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams is actually going to finally add something that was missing

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.400
from the first Bioshock and what was missing from the first Bioshock for being a first

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:18.400
person shooter?

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.400
Multiplayer.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.600
That's right.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:24.040
Apparently this is all according to some recent job listings that were discovered.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.080
The Bioshock team is looking for some multiplayer gameplay experts.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.520
They're looking for some people who know how to extend and enhance the Unreal Engine 3

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.560
with proprietary networking technology to address gameplay performance and so on.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:43.240
As somebody who can deliver a robust, scalable and responsive multiplayer gameplay code and

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.300
backend services for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:51.480
So unless there's some top secret unannounced project going on here, you can almost count

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.340
on the fact that Bioshock 2 is going to have multiplayer in it.

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.600
Which is something the first one was pretty lacking.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.800
Although honestly, I mean it didn't need it.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.380
Bioshock was a hell of a first person shooter game.

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:07.080
You know that even people that don't play a lot of first person shooters like me can

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.080
get into.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.760
Because it was almost like Silent Hill-ish in how scary it was, at least for me.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.700
Kind of the psychological element of the game.

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:19.360
So it's going to be interesting to see what multiplayer does to all that.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.760
Then that gets me thinking, since I invoked Silent Hill in that last story, why did we

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.400
never get like a multiplayer Silent Hill?

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.240
Wouldn't that be kind of interesting?

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:30.240
Well because they tried, I don't think it would work out.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.440
I guess it wouldn't because Silent Hill, you know a lot of times is somebody's personal

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:35.440
interpretation.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.440
You know what I mean?

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.560
It's usually a very personalized story so I don't think anything like that would really

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.560
work.

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.560
But it's fun to think about.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:42.560
Not really.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560
Shut up.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:51.720
Guitar Hero World Tour is going to be getting some brand new download packs in February.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:58.040
The first pack is going to be the Acoustic Track Pack, which is available for 440 Microsoft

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.040
Points.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.280
Included with that will be the song Holic.

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.280
That makes me angry.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.280
Oops.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280
No.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:13.200
And the Acoustic Track Pack, which will be available for 440 Microsoft Points or $5.49,

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:20.000
will include three different songs, including Drive by Incubus, a new slang by The Shins,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.240
and Wonderwall, the Oasis cover by Ryan Adams.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.240
Those are each also available for 160 Microsoft Points or $2 each.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.640
Wait a minute.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.920
Ryan Adams covered Wonderwall?

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.460
Like, wow.

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:38.920
That's going to be bad.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.920
I'm sorry.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.580
I saw Ryan Adams once in concert and he was kind of a douche.

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:49.020
So I mean, he's a douchey guy covering a douchey song from a douchey band.

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:52.360
I mean, this is just like, oh, this is going to be terrible.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.360
Sorry.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.360
Then we have the Wings Track Pack, which is also available for 440 Microsoft Points or

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:08.300
$5.49, including Junior's Farm, Hi Hi Hi, and Jet, and I'm sure nothing that has to

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:13.080
do with the television series Wings.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:20.360
Then we have the Bob Seger Track Pack, also 440 Microsoft Points and $5.49, including

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:26.840
that old-time rock and roll, that's awesome, Her Strut, and Get Out of Denver, which is

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:30.100
a live version.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.080
An old buddy of Orange Lounge Radio, Marissa, is in chat right now.

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.160
I love me some Marissa.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.800
I hope she comes back to the show at some point.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.760
She's in chat right now, so Marissa Congusto, and she's saying, yes, he did in regards to

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.760
Ryan Adams.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.480
He changed the melody, and then OMG, no, I heart Oasis.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.480
Don't get me wrong.

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.480
I like Oasis.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.480
I actually downloaded some of their stuff for Rock Band, but if you ever have listened

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.920
to them in interviews, they are kind of douchey.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:54.920
They're straight up assholes.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.920
What are you talking about?

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.600
But you know, hey, some of the greatest musicians were big douchebags, so, you know.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.600
And some weren't.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600
All right.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.600
Wait.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600
Sorry, Loki.

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600
Oh, that's it.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:11.120
Oh, OK, well, then we'll talk about PC games, and interesting that they say, at least according

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.520
to a survey that's coming out from, I believe, is this coming from the MPD group?

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.520
Yes, it is.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:23.640
MPD group is saying 47% of PC game purchases are, in fact, digital.

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.800
So meaning, you know, Steam, D2D, or whatever's going on there.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:31.000
So this is funny, because last week, weren't we just talking about how it seemed like the

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.280
shelf space at GameStop for PC games was little to none?

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.280
Yes.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.040
So, kind of interesting here.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:43.640
Apparently, according to the survey, 93% of PC gamers bought at least one game digitally

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.840
in the past 12 months.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.760
71% bought four games digitally.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.760
Very interesting.

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.360
But then I think about some of those games, like PopCap, and those types of games, like,

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.320
you know, if you go and download, you know, because I bring this up, because obviously

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.560
they're huge, casual PC games, you know, and a lot of people go to the site, download the

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.520
trial game, and then you can, you know, put your credit card number in online and get

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.760
the full version.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.480
That's digital distribution right there.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:11.560
You know, I don't think that necessarily means, like, half of all games are bought off Steam.

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.560
I don't think that's necessarily what it means.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.280
I think it goes a little deeper than that, especially when you filter in these classic

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:21.760
games from a site like Yahoo Games or whatever, where, you know, you can get, you know, click

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:25.320
now and put in your credit card number to get the full version of Diner Dash 5.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.320
Woo!

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.320
And it will be.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:28.320
So.

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320
Yeah.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.600
That's kind of not surprising in a way, but interesting.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:33.600
Yes.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600
Very.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.600
You know what else is interesting?

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.200
I'm sure that means the shelf space is going to continue to shrink.

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.120
What else is interesting, Logie?

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:47.360
People finding different things about LittleBigPlanet, including some upcoming patch details.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:54.960
Apparently, this was leaked out from a photo that was on Media Modicles Flickr page.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:00.160
And if you look very closely, you'll notice that there is a white board with a bunch of

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:04.120
different information about download content and updates.

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:10.120
And the next one that's on the list there, which I can't quite see the code name for,

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:17.520
but it will include new tutorials and online creation mode, where you'll be able to work

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:20.680
with other players and create your own levels online.

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.680
Awesome.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:26.160
And apparently, there's also going to be a new arcade pack at some point.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.480
I don't know what exactly that is.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.480
Arcade pack?

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:30.480
Yeah.

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:31.480
It says...

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.480
That could be all kinds of cool!

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.040
...what will include no idea.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:35.680
But something else.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.680
Yeah.

01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:39.560
I'm trying to see code name.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.640
What are your thoughts on LittleBigPlanet, RicePrincess?

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:44.800
You haven't talked a lot about it on the show, but I know you love Wii.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.220
You hate 360.

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.420
So PS3's got to be a nice neutral ground.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.420
What do you think about LittleBigPlanet?

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:50.420
I don't know.

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:51.920
I've never played it.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.920
Really?

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920
Really.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.920
I haven't.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:55.920
It's actually a lot of fun.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.920
It was my favorite game that came out last year.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:57.920
Really?

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:58.920
Yeah, I love it.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:31:59.920
I don't have a PS3.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.160
You've got to see how cheesy some of the user levels are.

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.160
I think that's how you will like it.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:09.080
Go on there and play the Warcraft-inspired Onyxia's Lair level.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.080
Oh, God.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.960
You'll love it for how cheesy it can be.

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:12.960
I hope so.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.960
I wonder if there's a Rocky Horror Picture Show level.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:15.960
There should be.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.960
There ought to be.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.960
I'm going to search for one.

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:18.960
Oh, my word.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960
If not, we need to make one somehow.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960
Totally.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.960
Where your character has to jump to the left and then step to the right.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.960
Oh, my God.

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:24.960
Consistently.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.960
And utilize the pelvic thrust.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.960
Yes.

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:27.960
And utilize the pelvic thrust.

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:28.960
To drive people insane.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:29.960
All right.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:30.960
Shut up.

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:31.960
All right.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.480
But all these features sound pretty awesome for LittleBigPlanet.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.480
Yes.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:37.960
So, no word to the time frame?

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:38.960
No.

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:46.080
But, again, this is based off information that's coming off of a picture of a whiteboard.

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:54.720
Well, still, you know, if the studio themselves put up the picture, I would actually say that

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:58.960
is a pretty respectable source because I don't think they're going to think to, quick, erase

01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.960
the whiteboard.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.960
We're spilling all our secrets.

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.960
You know what I mean?

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.800
They're spilling your secrets onto the whiteboard.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.040
Sorry.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.040
I'm laughing at chat.

01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.040
AcidicVampire in chat.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.040
Chat.onoursonstrated.com.

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:12.440
You're getting read a lot tonight, buddy.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.800
He's saying a lot of funny things.

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.520
It says, Skye, play the Parker Posey level.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.520
It's not popular, but it's great.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.520
What?

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.880
There's a Parker Posey level.

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:21.880
Oh, my God.

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.560
I want to play it so bad.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.200
I think I'm going to do that right after the show.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.880
No, because I'm going to play Resident Evil 5.

01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.520
I'm going to push you if you don't let me.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:31.960
I have to put that in the queue.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.920
Do I get to unlock stickers of Parker Posey?

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:34.920
I don't know.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.920
If so, I'm so sold.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.920
That's awesome.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.920
Like, party girl and everything.

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.920
Oh, God.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:39.920
Amazing.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.800
Aw, or like, why is that?

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.520
Silent Nathan is now suddenly interested in Little Big Planet?

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.440
Maybe I'll go play it right now.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.440
Right now.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.440
Now.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.440
All right.

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.440
Bye.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:58.440
Um, hey, speaking of games that I want to play right now, I can't play this right now,

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.840
but apparently it's going to be in development.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:03.160
Tron, a new game.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:04.160
A new Tron game.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.520
You know, they showed that trailer for Tron 2, or TR2N.

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.720
What they showed at Comic Con.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:14.920
Apparently there is a game coming out for this whole thing as well.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.920
This is according to Variety.

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.320
Even though there were some issues with the Disney video game company, Variety magazine

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:24.520
is reporting that apparently Disney is shipping to game developers a concept for TR2N, or

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.520
Tron 2.

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.680
Of course, no idea what it's going to be like or anything.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:35.520
But of course this makes me think, okay, there was a Tron 2.0, and it wasn't very well received.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.280
So hopefully whatever, but the original Tron game was awesome.

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.280
Never played it.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.280
It's pretty awesome.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:46.800
They have it on Xbox Live, and it was one of those games that was better in the 80s,

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.040
and when you play it now you're kind of like, oh, this game is better left in my imagination.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.540
But it still was pretty cool, especially for an 80s game.

01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:57.920
What do you think about, like, reinventing franchises?

01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.920
Such as Tron?

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.440
Sure.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.120
I'm okay with it, I guess.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.400
I don't know.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.320
I think especially a series like Tron needed a sequel a long time ago.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:09.320
It seems a little late.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.480
But then when you look at a series like The Goonies, or there is no series there, right?

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.040
They don't need to make A Goonies 2.

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.360
Like if they made A Goonies 2, you know it's going to be stupid.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360
Or The Karate Kid?

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360
No.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360
Just no.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:21.680
Are you talking about the movie or the game?

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.360
Oh, the movie.

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.800
The game was amazing.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:27.520
That's another classic game that we need to have sometimes, is Goonies 2.

01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.520
That game was amazing.

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.520
Heck yes.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.520
Oh my god.

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.020
I thought you did that as a classic game already.

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.000
I don't know if Dark Soccer has ever done it.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
I'd have to check the wiki.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.600
But I don't think it's ever been a classic game.

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.880
I'd have to check the wiki on your own show.

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.880
Yes.

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:41.880
Well look, I don't know.

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:44.880
Look, we've done the classic game of the week for like at least a year now.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.280
So I don't know every single game we've highlighted.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.280
There's a lot.

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.960
But thankfully we have a wiki and the fans update the wiki because they're awesome.

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:55.200
Did someone let Nathan run in the house really to go play Playstation 3?

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.200
Probably that jerkwad.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.720
Hey Nathan, you're cool.

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.080
And not a jerkwad at all.

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.080
Anyhow.

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:08.760
It's a neutron game in development, probably to come out with a movie if they can find

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:14.400
somebody to do, you know, take the financial hit for all the development, I guess, in this

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:15.400
economy.

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:17.000
Disney does have their own studio.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.200
Yeah, but it's been hurting.

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.320
Well yeah, because they put out Turok and I mean, come on.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.120
I could have told you that Turok's gonna suck before they even put Turok out.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:30.000
And they're like, seriously, really, you're gonna put Turok out?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Really?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.840
This is something you think is a great idea?

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.880
The economy is going downhill, what game should we make?

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.880
Turok!

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.280
It's a great idea!

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.680
Amaze Satsuma in chat wonders if Sky wants a Showgirls 2.

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.040
You know there was supposed to be a Showgirls 2, where, cause at the end of Showgirls 1

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.320
it alludes to the fact that Nomi Malone is going to Hollywood, and Showgirls 2 was supposed

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.080
to be a parody on Hollywood, like the first one was a parody on Vegas, but then the movie

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.600
came out and they decided to can the sequel.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.600
Never mind.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:04.440
I would be in full support of a Showgirls 2, but not now, I mean Elizabeth Berkley's

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.280
not gonna do it, what's the point?

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:12.800
The point is, that we have all these wonderful porn studios that can develop a movie now,

01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:17.800
I mean they're doing more theatrical movies, and hell, they have all the knockoffs, like

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:25.560
all the TV show ones, like Not the Bradys, Not the Munsters, Not Bewitched, I don't know

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:33.640
what the other ones are, but, I mean, not My Three Sons, I'm not sure about that one.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.320
How come porn studios don't get into gaming?

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.640
You know you see all these legitimate movie studios getting into gaming.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:44.840
There's porn actresses that are in the gaming, but you know, not, I don't know.

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:47.640
There's a lot of people that love World of Warcraft.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:48.640
There are.

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.080
I don't know why, but there are.

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.240
I knew a stripper who played World of Warcraft, and all the nerds would like message her on

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.360
the message board, like, oh my god, did you do this?

01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:01.240
There's a stripper that's over at our local strip club that plays World of Warcraft.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.840
There's probably a stripper at every strip club that plays World of Warcraft, because

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:09.840
everybody plays World of Warcraft, I'm just saying, though, I don't know.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.840
Plus think about it, if you're a stripper, you know, you're working nights, you're probably

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:17.680
home during the day with a kid, I'm kind of reminded, I don't know if you've ever seen

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:24.180
the Guild, but I'm kind of reminded of Carla from the Guild, who by the way is by far

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:26.880
my favorite character on that program.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:33.480
But the stripper that's local that plays WoW, she's a nerd, like she's an Asian girl, and

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.120
her stage name's Kitana.

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.280
Yeah, that's the one.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.280
Yeah, that's totally the one.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.280
Freaking dork.

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:44.600
Wait a minute, do we just have a six degrees of stripper here in the studio?

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:47.720
Like we just found out that Loki and Rice Princess know the same stripper?

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:49.240
Do you know that stripper?

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.160
I don't know her, but I've seen her movies.

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.680
I don't like her at a large movie or anything.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.240
Well, I know her that well, but I know her in the biblical sense.

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:04.880
No, you know, when we're really bored sometimes, you know, the wife and I decided to go to

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.920
the strip club.

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:09.120
She wants to go again, actually, she keeps saying that.

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.760
I want to go, I keep saying I want to go.

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:13.600
We need to have an OLR at this strip club night.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:16.680
No, but seriously, I mean, when you're getting, you know, a lot of times when you're getting

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:21.600
like a lap dance and stuff, it's seriously the weirdest conversations, I mean, it's like

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.000
about games and shit.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.560
You know, you mentioned that you do a game podcast and it's like, oh my God, I play games

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560
too.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560
That's so funny.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.560
Like, how does that even come up in conversation?

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.120
Is she like, so what do you do?

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.080
And you're like, well, actually, here's the thing is because, you know, to get into how

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:42.760
strip clubs operate, they have to wait until the new song begins because you have, when

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:47.640
you're paying for a lap dance is for X number of songs and you're not just going to start,

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.960
you know, if it's in the middle of a song.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:52.760
So you have to sit there and wait for the new song and during that time it's you.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.760
So what do you do?

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:54.760
You know, how's it going?

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.560
You know, that kind of stuff.

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.520
And that's where the games come up because that's all I do is games.

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:04.080
No, the time I got a lap dance, because I went to the strip club once and my friends

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:05.480
like, you were there, Irene, right?

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.480
Okay.

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:09.920
My friends made me say which stripper I thought was the hottest.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.920
And naturally I said the one that looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, because there was

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.300
a stripper there looked just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:19.520
And she, you know, they, but they paid for a lap dance and it pretty much started right

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:20.520
away.

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.520
I guess the song was coming on or whatever.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.760
Like, you know, she was rubbing her boobies in my face and the whole thing and it was

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.560
just very awkward for me, but whatever.

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.840
So finally it was over and she said, Oh, you just, you should just relax, honey.

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.480
She's like, you know, I hope you enjoyed it.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.340
You know, you could tell her self esteem was probably hurt a little bit because I was so

01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:38.920
nervous and I'm like, honey, it's nothing against you.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.160
I'm just gay.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.360
And she says, Oh, I could kind of tell.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.280
And then she's just sitting there and she's talking to me and she's like, Oh, my roommate's

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.360
gay and I love him.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.360
He's the best thing.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.320
And so she's talking to me for like a whole nother song, but it was really awkward because

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.880
she, like, she had no clothes on except some, you know, a thong.

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:57.920
And it was, it was kind of strange, you know, I was just kind of like, just put a t-shirt

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:01.400
on or something, you know, an acidic vampire says, Rob loves the boobies.

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:02.400
Yes.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.560
Especially when he's drunk.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.800
Rob might be gay, but he loves all gay guys like boobies.

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.800
It's, I don't know what it is.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.800
I guess everybody really likes boobies.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.800
Who doesn't like boobies?

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.800
Women like boobies.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800
Yeah.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.800
Women do.

01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.440
But yeah, you were going to say something, Nathan?

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:25.960
I just want to point out though, some props in chat for the strip club with the wife,

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:29.160
because some folks are like, Game Guru says, wait, wait, wait, you go to the strip club

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.160
with your wife?

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.960
She loves going.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:35.020
And somebody, it's not very often.

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.280
It's just like, it was a while ago.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.000
Game Guru says your wife is the coolest.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.560
No, we seriously, we seriously thought we were going to do this, but we were so fucking

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:48.300
tired from like the wedding day.

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:52.800
We were seriously going to go in our wedding garb to the strip club.

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.960
We were almost going to do it, but we were so exhausted.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:59.240
Like during the wedding, we were like, dude, yeah, we should totally go afterwards, just

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:02.120
dressed up in the tux and everything.

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:03.120
Because that would be hilarious.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:06.200
But we were just like so beat at the end of the day.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.200
It's like, fuck that.

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.200
We're not going anywhere.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.200
Nice.

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:10.200
Go sleep.

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.200
Or not fuck that.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.200
Yeah, boobs are awesome.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:18.080
Let's see, Rama says Skye, you're a hypocrite.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.680
You have a problem with a woman in a bra and panties at a strip bar.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:22.680
Hold up.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:23.680
She had no bra on.

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.680
Okay.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:25.680
Yeah.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:26.680
Just panties.

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:27.680
I wouldn't even call it like panties.

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:32.800
When I, when you say panties, I think of like granny panties, you know, like regular panties,

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:33.800
not a thong.

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.520
She had like a thong on.

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.920
But she'll have you go to a R.A.

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.800
Rock, your picture show convention full of women in bra and panties.

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:40.800
Well, that's different.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.280
That's why you're going there.

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.280
That's theater.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.280
That's art.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.280
It's art.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.920
That's funny that you're laughing at that.

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:48.920
That's art.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:55.440
But anyways, yes, there are a lot of people in all occupations that play World of Warcraft.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:56.440
Even strippers.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:00.560
It's not like, you know, oh, I strip therefore I cannot play games at all.

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.440
But yeah, porn stars, strippers.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.880
There's a lot.

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.320
I mean, fuck.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.280
Just read like IGN.

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:10.400
They do these stupid like babes of the day things and a lot of them that they put on

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.160
there have fucking, you know, game, you know, interests and stuff like that.

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.840
And you know, it's just all the more reason people think, oh my God, women, games, ooh,

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840
got to.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.840
Yeah.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:24.200
Marissa is in chat again saying they make all sorts of terrible porn games.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.140
Remember how I said earlier they need, why don't porn studios make games?

01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:30.520
They make all sorts of terrible porn games, but they're usually multiplayer online.

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.320
I learned this by working in the porn capital of the world, Chatsworth, California.

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.320
Okay.

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.320
Two comments to that.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.520
A, I should have figured that out because, you know, on porn websites, so I've heard,

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:43.840
you see a lot of times ads for those like multiplayer sex.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:44.840
So you've heard.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:45.840
Yeah.

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:46.840
I just heard through Loki.

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:47.840
Through your eyes.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.040
That that's what you see on those sites.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.040
And I guess you're right.

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.200
I just don't think of them because they're not really out there and about.

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:57.080
And B, I did not realize Chatsworth, California was the capital of porn industry, but it doesn't

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:58.080
surprise me.

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:03.320
But if you've ever been to Chatsworth, California, it's, it's, you know.

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.100
Is it better than Buttonwillow?

01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:06.600
It's better than Buttonwillow.

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:11.960
It's I would say Fresno is probably better than Chatsworth.

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.640
And I like how we're only laughing because everybody else doesn't live in California.

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.000
No offense to the people there.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Wow.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.320
Wink, wink, hint, hint.

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.600
My grandma's from there.

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.880
And her movie comes out next month.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:26.880
Ew.

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:27.880
Ew.

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:28.880
Ew.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:29.880
Gilf.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:30.880
Gross.

01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:35.240
And then Marissa also says, Rob can have some of my boob to play with, stress toys.

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.800
I have too much anyway.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:37.800
Marissa does.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:38.800
Marissa has some nice big boobies.

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:44.160
I would, I would definitely, you know, help relieve some stress.

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:48.960
Your own stress all day with her boobs.

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:49.960
All right.

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.640
Can we move on back into video games?

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:54.640
I don't know how we got on the whole topic of strippers from Tron.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.640
Who cares?

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.640
Who cares?

01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:01.880
Like, that was the last story we just did was Tron, I just want to point out.

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:06.960
And then suddenly it's about strippers playing World of Warcraft and boobies in Chatsworth,

01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.040
California being the board capital of the world.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:15.320
I definitely would pay good money to see a stripper that's glowing in the Tron outfit.

01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.320
Absolutely.

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.400
Hey, that, you know, there's that guy on the internet, the Tron guy who wears that outfit.

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:22.840
No, no, no, not him.

01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.960
But you'll imagine if a woman wore that outfit.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.960
Is he hot?

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.080
I don't want to see a woman the size of the Tron guy wearing that outfit.

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.080
All right.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.480
I can't process this much data.

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.160
Dark Knight in chat says, thank God Jamie's not here for this one.

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:43.280
You know, it probably would have derailed even if she was here because it's not the

01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.600
fact that Jamie's not here.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.800
It's the fact that Rice Princess is here.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.840
Hey, I didn't bring up, wait, yes I did.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:51.840
Yes you did.

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.840
La, la, la.

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.840
Let's move on.

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:56.800
Why do we have this whole six degrees of strippers thing going on here?

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.960
Or we just both live in the same town and both go to the same strip club.

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:04.600
Why am I not being invited to said strip club?

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.440
I haven't gone in like a year or two.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:09.160
We need to fix this.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:10.600
It's been a long time.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.680
It's just because you go to the strip club and then afterwards you're like, that costs

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:16.160
me a lot of money for very little time.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.440
Why the fuck did I do that?

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.400
And then you forget about it after a while.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.480
You have guilty gear news, right Loki?

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:27.120
Yes, speaking of guilt for spending all that money in strip clubs.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:33.840
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus has been announced by Axis to be coming to the US.

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:38.600
They're planning on bringing it out on the PS2, the PSP, and the Wii.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:45.440
You may remember Axis also brought out Guilty Gear XX Accent Core a little bit earlier.

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.840
I think it was last year actually.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:54.320
And this new game was planned on, I guess, coming out spring 2009, probably the latter

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.360
half of the spring.

01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:02.920
But it's not that different from Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, but Plus does feature some,

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:07.840
I guess, more characters and some different stuff that they tweaked.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:12.640
Sorry, I was just showing Rice Princess a picture of Tron Guy.

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:13.640
Thank you chatters.

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.560
And then I almost vomited.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:18.680
Oh, so Guilty Gear, yeah.

01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:19.680
So it'll be coming out.

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.520
Too bad it's something new, Guilty Gear.

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.200
Or wait, that wasn't, it was something blue, I forget what they called it.

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:29.160
The new game, it's not Guilty Gear, but it's done by the same people.

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:34.440
It's all like HD, or not cel-shaded, but like hand drawn animation stuff.

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440
No idea.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:37.440
I don't know.

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:41.560
Alright, well let's move on to the mailbag.

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:44.580
It's the part of the show every week that you guys can send us an email and we'll read

01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:47.080
it here on the show and respond to whatever's in it.

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:48.080
Or make fun of it.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.600
One of the two will happen.

01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.320
We invite your emails to be sent in to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:57.940
Although we didn't have a whole lot this week, that's probably because our podcast feed was

01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:58.940
behind a little bit.

01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:02.240
But by the way, it is getting caught up, a new show just went out today, so go look for

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.240
it.

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.640
We do have at least one email to read and it's from Australia.

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.760
This is from Mike in Australia.

01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.080
Mike in Australia says, hello to all in studio, Rob, Loki, Silent Nathan and Rice Princess.

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.280
Oh, he must be listening right now.

01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:15.280
Wow.

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:16.280
Because he knew exactly who was on the show.

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.280
Well, hello.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:20.160
I've had the opportunity to listen live two weeks in a row, which is a treat considering

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.120
during your half-time Puppy Bowl music break, it's coming up to 2 p.m., so generally I'm

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.120
at work.

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.600
Firstly, I want to ask your thoughts about some good platform games on the DS.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:33.200
I don't have an Xbox 360 or PS3, so I'm stuck with the DS Lite, which is good enough at

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.200
the moment.

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.800
I've acquired Castlevania, Order of Eclatia, but haven't really gotten into yet, played

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.400
the first level or so.

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.440
I'm slowly playing through Yoshi Island DS, so if you can suggest anything similar, that

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:44.440
would be good.

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:47.280
Before I finish, I just want to say great show as always and really enjoy listening

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.360
to your shows.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.840
Take care and hope to listen live again soon.

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.600
Mike, PS, this email is not sponsored by anyone, but for you guys to learn a new Australian

01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:02.640
term, budgie, bud, budgie smugglers, I guess the email's brought to us by budgie smugglers.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.840
Explanation from Urban Dictionary, Australian slang term for men's tight-fitting speedo-style

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.840
swimwear.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.280
The lump in the front apparently resembles a budgie when it is stuck down the front of

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.280
someone's shorts.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:13.560
That's a budgie.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.160
That's what I want to know.

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.960
Is that like a Snuggie?

01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.040
Oh, I bet it is.

01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:22.120
That's like the Australian version of a grape.

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:23.120
I mean.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:24.120
Alright.

01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:25.120
Look, look, back to the question at hand.

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.520
How about some DS platform games?

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.600
You know, I haven't played a whole lot on DS as of late.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.560
I just, I have this thing against playing games on DS for some reason.

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:37.200
I like playing games on the TV, but to help our poor guy out.

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.200
What are some games?

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:41.920
See, even when I'm playing the DS, I'm playing a lot of RPGs, like Final Fantasy IV or Mario

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:42.920
games.

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:43.920
Is this no good DS games?

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.920
No.

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:45.920
Well, platformers specifically.

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:50.440
Like things like Castlevania, Yoshi Island, what are some other good platform games?

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.320
New Super Mario Brothers is definitely like one of the classics if you don't have that

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.320
yet.

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.320
You gotta get that.

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.320
I'm gonna look to chat too for some hints.

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.320
Chat.

01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.320
What are some good ones?

01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.320
The new games that have come out.

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:06.400
Of course, there's the new Kirby game, Kirby Superstar Ultra, which is, you know, port.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:13.800
And then there's, was it the Chase Phoenix meets Felicity.

01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:18.040
That's supposed to be kind of like Kirby's Canada's Curse.

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:22.400
And then, other platformer games, I'm sure there's a lot of crappy games that have come

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.280
out that have been like platformers.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.040
Wasn't N out on DS, didn't they release a version of N?

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.700
Yeah, that's kind of a neat little game.

01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:31.440
That's coming out, or that's already out.

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:35.040
And then, you know, I don't know.

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:37.180
Game Guru in chat suggests Sonic Rush.

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:39.520
It's better than the console Sonics.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.840
You would definitely also have to pick up the Chrono Trigger for the DS.

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:48.520
It's not a platform game, but it's way better than any of the games you've already mentioned.

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.720
Also a budgie is a bird.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:51.720
Like a parakeet.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.720
Oh, thank you.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:55.720
Seriously?

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:58.200
I feel like I learn new things on this show every day.

01:50:58.200 --> 01:50:59.200
The more you know.

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:00.200
There you go.

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.200
The more you know.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:02.200
Alright.

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.200
There you have it.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.200
Yay.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.800
I don't know if any of you in the chat room do agree with Sonic Rush.

01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:06.800
So there you go.

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:09.880
If you don't own that one yet, you should probably check out Sonic Rush.

01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:12.240
Hitstun though suggests Tony Hawk's American Skateland.

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.040
It's kind of a platform game.

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.040
Sorta.

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.040
Yep.

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.040
Yep.

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.440
So there's some suggestions from us to you.

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:21.320
If you have an email you want to send us, mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, I'd like

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:25.340
to hear more international slang terms, like budgie smugglers.

01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:28.120
That was definitely educational.

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:31.880
There you go.

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.340
What'd you say, Nathan?

01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:37.320
Next time you put on a Speedo, look down and it will resemble a parakeet in your pants.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:40.840
I don't think there's going to be a next time I'm going to put on a Speedo.

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:45.420
If I wear- On Naturale.

01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:50.640
If I go swimming, I wear like, you know, swimming trunks, not, you know, in this country it's

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.060
not appropriate usually to wear Speedos to the beach unless you are really good looking

01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:59.040
and I'm not really good looking, sadly, so there you go.

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.400
People do it anyway.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.400
That's true.

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:07.720
The Tron guy wears that whole thing in public, so whatever.

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:08.720
Let's go on.

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:10.280
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:13.960
We'll get to the Skype line soon also, by the way, you guys, Skype line opening up a

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:14.960
little later.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:20.680
Well, here's a game if you're a fan of the Jump Superstars games that they have on the

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.680
DS.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:30.440
There's a new Konami PSP brawler coming out and no word on, let's see here, what the title

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:39.760
is on it, but it's got- Oh, Sunday X Magazine is the- I guess it's just all the different

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:45.160
manga characters, but they've got, you know, Sunday X Magazine Tyson Action and it's got

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:57.400
everything from, you know, Samurai Deeper Kyo to Get Backers, Air Gear, what is it,

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:02.660
so it's basically all the stuff that's like, you know, from Shonen Sunday Weekly Shonen,

01:53:02.660 --> 01:53:06.800
so the Shonen Jump games, so very awesome.

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:18.160
Project Arms, Inuyasha, I don't know, actually, you know, Jump Ultimate Stars was okay.

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:23.080
It was a neat fighting game on the DS, it was kind of like Smash Brothers a little bit,

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:28.720
but the way that you use, like, they had a bottom portion of your screen that you can

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:35.040
align different manga panels and you'd get different abilities and assist characters

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:39.480
and stuff like that based on what you had in there and you had to fit them in, so it's

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:45.200
almost like the sticker system on Smash Brothers Brawl, so it's kind of neat.

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:46.200
I see.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:49.080
Boy, these Smash Brothers Brawl clones are sure getting popular lately.

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:51.600
I remember you brought up the one about the Ninja Turtles last week and that was like

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.600
confirmed on Monday.

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:58.200
Well, yeah, some of the people did Brawl, or not Brawl, Smash Brothers, so it's part

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:04.920
of the same team, so it's going to be very similar to that, but this game, yeah, it looks

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.400
pretty fun and we need good, you know, PSP games.

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:12.320
Alright, more PSP the merrier, I suppose.

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:16.320
Sega is going to be trying to make a new arcade game, which sounds kind of interesting.

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:22.360
It's called Border Break, Sega Network Robot Wars, and it's a networked robot wars, of

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:23.360
course.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:27.960
Arcade game that's being made by Sega, apparently it's going to be shown at the next AOU show

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:34.880
that's coming up in Japan, 20 players in this game, 10 on 10 robot battles, so this is like

01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:37.840
the kind of thing that is going to be very expensive, you're going to see in the corner

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.840
of a Dave and Busters or something like that, I don't think this is something you're going

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:47.280
to see very much of, this is like an entertainment setter, 20 mech things, that's a lot.

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.280
That's crazy.

01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.280
That's awesome.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.280
I know, I want to play it.

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.640
It's awesome, but I don't think you'll ever see one on these shores.

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.560
Just arcades aren't popular enough over here, maybe a Dave and Busters would be like your

01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:56.560
biggest bet.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:01.960
Well, you may not have to have 20 cabinets, but I mean, it still could be, you know, cool.

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:05.840
Yeah, it might be cool, but I don't know if you're going to see it, that's all.

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.480
It's probably going to be expensive.

01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:11.680
I don't think there's enough arcade stuff to justify it, sadly.

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:15.620
So, we'll see, we'll see, but anyway, it is in development.

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.760
There's another unique game, which I'm not really sure what arcades are going to be carrying

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:24.680
this because it has a lot of parts that go along with it, but it's a game that's come

01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.920
out, or coming out in Japan, called Block Pippo.

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:36.760
And what it is, it's a game that's controlled with Lego-style blocks, and you actually build

01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:41.300
up platforms and stuff using these blocks, and there's like a giant bin below the screen

01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:44.760
with these blocks in there, and you build platforms for the characters to run on, kind

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:49.240
of like Lemmings, almost, by the look of it.

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:55.720
It actually is being tested for the U.S. as well, under the name Brick People, but it's

01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:00.320
very unique looking, and it's got a lot of, you know, the block things that are going

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:03.880
to be in this bin, and I just have a feeling, you put that in an arcade, kids are going

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:10.880
to be stealing that shit left and right, but it's neat.

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.440
Why can't kids just be more responsible?

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.280
That's a good one.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:17.920
Yeah, Lioshin agrees, those blocks will get stolen so fast if it was in the U.S., they'd

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:19.840
have to be all put on those cords.

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.560
That would be a mess.

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:25.760
You're like, crap, I can't put these blocks in there because of all these cords.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.760
Shit, I got stuck and tangled in these cords.

01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:30.760
That's the game.

01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.800
Help!

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:37.440
Interesting games spotted around the gaming blogs this week, Go Nintendo featured this,

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.840
a Wii homebrew game called Super Sonic Wii, but what's interesting about this game, I'm

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.800
actually going to try to play the YouTube footage here in studio, a little clip of what

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:50.000
the game looks like here, if it'll actually play, looks like it's timing out, but I looked

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.600
at it a little bit before the show, it's a game that looks just like frequency or amplitude.

01:56:54.600 --> 01:57:02.840
It's actually amplitude, it's based off of the game Amplitude DS, which was a spin off

01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.680
of Amplitude, but now they have it for the Wii, and it looks pretty awesome.

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:14.320
If you go to the actual website for the game, which I believe Super Sonic Wii.com or Super

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:17.920
Sonic.com.

01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:21.480
There we go, there's a little clip of it.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:25.160
It's definitely a scaled down, all you can hear is the audio, but I'll tell you, it looks

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.480
like a very scaled down version of Amplitude, because you don't really have the hypnotic

01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:34.920
backgrounds that a game like Amplitude had, it looks like you only have three tracks,

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:42.360
but still, it's a start, it's something, it's bound to get sued, especially if that rumor

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:48.160
from a few weeks back that harmonics might be making a comeback with this stuff is true.

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.160
There it is, Super Sonic Wii.

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:53.600
Well, you can download it now, it's available out there, so if you wanna check it out, you've

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:58.160
got a homebrew enabled Wii system, definitely check this out, and of course if you have

01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:02.660
a homebrew enabled DS, you can check out Amplitude DS.

01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:06.600
Of course, homebrewing any of those systems might violate your warranty, so be careful,

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:09.520
and don't say OLR told you to do it.

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:17.440
You don't need that crap, seriously.

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:24.400
But there's something else that's gonna be coming out here soon, it's a new Wii game,

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:30.760
it's called Glacier 2, they're comparing it to Twisted Metal, except you drive down mountains,

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.960
I would say it's more like full auto, but you drive down mountains, because I mean that

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:40.960
was more like this game, I think, it's basically a combat racing game, and it'll have 18 different

01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:47.480
levels, it'll feature 7 different cars, all with giant guns and weapons on them, like

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:55.360
any other car should have, and this is a brand new game from a company called Team 6 Studios,

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:58.280
and this is their first Wii game.

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:02.280
I don't know, looks okay, but hey, we need a good combat racing game, and since they're

01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:07.000
not making another full auto game, this will have to do, I guess.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.280
Actually, no, I take that back, there was another combat racing game on the Wii, it's

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:18.040
called DT Racer, or DT Carnage, I think, what it was, and that's a combat racing game similar

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:24.200
to full auto, not very good though, from what I remember, but you can try that out, it's

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:28.080
probably like dirt cheap now.

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:34.440
Well, some other games that got really cheap lately were the Need for Speed games, because

01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:38.760
apparently they did not sell very well, the recent games they released, so EA decided

01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:43.120
if it worked for Batman, it's going to work for us, they're going to reboot the franchise,

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:46.720
so they're hitting the old reset button on the Need for Speed franchise, and they're

01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:51.560
going to release 3 new Need for Speed games in the year 2009.

01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:56.500
What's interesting though is that the whole concept behind it, one for the core gamers,

01:59:56.500 --> 02:00:01.000
one for the casual gamers, one for the online gamers, I think it's an interesting approach

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.500
to take with the games.

02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:07.280
Need for Speed Shift is the game that's coming out on Playstation 3, 360, PC, and PSP, and

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:12.620
that's the core game, that's like Project Gotham, coming out in the fall as well, Need

02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:17.400
for Speed Nitro, that's coming out on the DS and the Wii, which you can probably guess

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:21.820
is going to be the casual game, I think that's more like the original Need for Speed games,

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:27.000
it's also supposed to have giant head racers and car vaulting, lame, wait, car vaulting?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:30.800
God, I hope this is not another fucking game, wait, wait, wait, that might just be like

02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:39.640
a vault to actually put your car in, no, that's car vaulting, aww, stupid, no, why, wouldn't

02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:40.640
you like that?

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:45.640
Well, I do like that, but you know, the fact that, car vaulting reminds me of the stupid

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:52.400
Cruisin game that they had come out, and that Cruisin game was a ripoff, or actually a port,

02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:58.200
was it not Need for Speed, the Fast and the Furious arcade game, the crappy Cruisin USA

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:03.320
based one, Cruisin World, I don't know, no, no, the Fast and the Furious game that came

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:08.920
to arcades, not good, I didn't even know they had a Fast and the Furious game in the arcade,

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:13.000
yeah, it's not good, it's based off Cruisin USA, I think it was kind of to try and compete

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.400
with, like, you know how when you go to an arcade, one of the things you still see tons

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:22.320
of people playing are what, Wangan, and uh, this is not even close, that's like saying

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:27.520
that a turd is competing with a diamond or something, Tigerclaw says, you mean Fast and

02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:33.720
the Furious Tokyo Drift arcade, I seen that at Walmart, yeah, it's awful, that's where

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:40.240
it belongs to, yeah, that's what Cruisin came out, that's actually what Cruisin was, alright,

02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.240
also a third game in the Need for Speed series, not for the Wii, if the other two don't sound

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.480
interesting to you, Need for Speed World Online, it's supposed to be a free online title, it's

02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:54.280
coming out in Asia first over the summer and then we'll get it in Christmas time, so I'm

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.840
assuming you probably have to pay for car upgrades or something, you know, probably

02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.760
based off the Asian model for MMOs where it's free, but then you have to pay for the good

02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:06.360
stuff, so, it's free, but your cars have no wheels, pay extra for the wheels, it's like

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:13.200
go, oh crap, can't go, by the way, the games are all being developed by different studios,

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.320
even though Black Box apparently kind of got, you know, kind of, well, pink slipped, a lot

02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.400
of them did, Black Box is still working on Need for Speed World Online, at least who's

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:27.880
left with EA Singapore, Need for Speed Nitro, the casual one is by EA Montreal, it's arcade

02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:33.440
racer is what they're calling it, Need for Speed Shift coming by Slightly Mad, they're

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:41.960
the guys that made GT Legends and Blimey apparently is on it too, GT-R2, Blimey! Wow. There you

02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:46.760
go, lots of Need for Speed in 2009, yeah, if you're a Need for Speed fan, that is exciting

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.920
news, DarkTetsuya in chat I believe is a Need for Speed fan and says, it's supposed to be

02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.920
a fourth one, yeah, there's a fourth secret one, but, I don't know, hopefully that's the

02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:02.360
good one, Need for Secrets, and you can only play it if you find it, cause they're gonna

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:09.520
hide it. Alright, and then of course we have to talk about the game that has download content

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:16.280
coming out the wazoo, Burnout Paradise, they're actually, there's a new rumored download that's

02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:19.720
gonna be available, actually I wouldn't say it's so much a rumor cause it's actually on

02:03:19.720 --> 02:03:27.120
their download store, but apparently it wasn't announced yet, so, oops, but it's a Burnout

02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:33.640
Paradise Police Cars, and they've got, you know, the actual link for it, but it says

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:40.360
coming soon on the actual in-game store, and they do have some screenshots, I guess, I

02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:47.240
don't know if it's preview pics or something like that, of the PCPD cars, so maybe new

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:53.040
game modes, some sort of chasing stuff, I don't know, Burnout Paradise is getting fucking

02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:57.920
awesome, and now meaning you can get the game for like 20 bucks, all the debt-free download

02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.560
content and all the paid download content is coming out. Much love to those folks for

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.520
just continuing to support a game that might have gotten bashed as mediocre when it came

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:11.120
out, but they still just expanding and expanding on it and making it pretty awesome, so, good

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:18.280
for you guys. We'll see, any time frame on when that could come out? No word, but I mean

02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:23.120
a lot of the stuff that they're talking about, like there's the Burnout Paradise, the new

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:28.480
cars, I think that's coming out this week, I mean probably later on, maybe this month,

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:35.360
possibly next, probably relatively soon. Alright, one more story for you guys tonight, then

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:40.520
we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:43.360
I don't know how busy it's gonna be tonight with a lot of our regulars catching the Super

02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.160
Bowl tonight, and I guess even though it's over, maybe the office or whatever they're

02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:51.400
showing right now, you know, maybe a little drunk from all the beer at the Super Bowl

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:55.680
parties, who knows, but we will open up the Skype line soon. One more story tonight and

02:04:55.680 --> 02:05:00.720
it involves a company we talk about a lot on this show, PopCap. PopCap is finally bringing

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:04.200
some of their games to the PlayStation Network, it actually happened this week, Bejeweled

02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:10.200
2 finally showed up on the PlayStation Network, and there also are plans to release Zuma,

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:16.760
Heavy Weapon, Feeding Frenzy, and Pagle. I know Pagle's pretty awesome. Pagle hasn't

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.320
even showed up on Xbox Live yet, so I'm curious if it'll beat it to the punch on PlayStation

02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:27.760
3, I kinda doubt it, they'll probably be released simultaneously, but there you go, $9.99 if

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:33.640
you wanna check out Bejeweled 2, that's one penny less than what you'll pay on Xbox Live.

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:38.340
I go where the bargain is. That's right. So there you have it, I don't think the game

02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:43.160
itself is much different, I think it's all the same modes from the Xbox 360 one, I don't

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:47.880
know if the achievements are as hard, or excuse me, trophies, or what have you, but, there

02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:53.760
you go. Man, I love that game. What, Bejeweled? Pagle. Oh, Pagle. Pagle's pretty awesome.

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:57.440
Pagle is pretty awesome. It is, I wanna play it now. So, well, you might get to play it

02:05:57.440 --> 02:06:03.340
on PlayStation Network soon, or Xbox 360, because I know you're a big 360 fan. Alright,

02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:07.820
so we're gonna go ahead and open up the Skype line now, 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the

02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:13.280
US and Canada, or you can call us on Skype, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio, while we

02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:16.240
wait for some calls to come in, because we do have a little bit of a delay between when

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:22.040
I say, hey, call in, and when people actually hear me say that on the radio. Loki, do we

02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:27.920
have any last minute stories tonight? Yeah, speaking of football, apparently there's that

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:35.640
whole deal where the retired NFL players were not getting any money from the new NFL games,

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:40.200
and their likenesses were being used without, you know, any sort of compensation. Well,

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:45.900
they have now finished that whole lawsuit, and they are going to be getting paid out

02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:54.080
on it. So, that's pretty cool. In the tune of $28.1 million by the NFL. Only, let's go

02:06:54.080 --> 02:07:00.520
to the Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? Hi, this is Spazinator. Hey, Spazinator,

02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:08.080
what's on your mind? Well, two things. First off, I just want to double check and make

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:17.160
sure I heard you correctly in part A. Did you see that if you had the collector's edition

02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:23.480
of Gears of War 2, you're going to lose your golden lancer? No, only if you were one of

02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:27.560
the people that downloaded it while, I guess, it accidentally went up on the marketplace

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:31.320
for free and so a bunch of people downloaded it, they want to restrict it so that only

02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:34.540
the people with the collector's edition actually have it. So, I don't know how they're going

02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:37.520
to figure that out. They're not going to. It's not going to happen. You don't think

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:39.680
they'll actually be able to figure out? No, they're not going to figure it out. Loki's

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:43.100
convinced they're not going to be able to figure it out, but if you legitimately have

02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:46.380
the gold gun from the collector's edition, you're not who they're trying to remove

02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:52.300
it from. I kind of agree about that. Because by one of the people that had bought the collector's

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:56.900
edition, I just hate to get my, you know, lose my feed me, you know?

02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:01.340
Wait, hold on. I'm not much of a Gears player. What is so special about the gold gun or is

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:02.100
it just that

02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:05.620
it's pretty? It's just a gold gun.

02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.700
It's just bragging rights more than anything.

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:12.180
You know, something to say, hey, I got the special edition.

02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:15.300
You know, it's kind of like the Iron Rich

02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:19.300
application for the iPhone. I don't know. I kind of thought maybe it fired gold bullets or

02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:20.820
something. Alright, what was your second question?

02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:24.820
Well, it's not so much a question, it's

02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:28.100
more like a stupid statement.

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:32.460
Well, we make a lot of those on this show, so go right ahead. Yeah,

02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:35.740
I was just thinking, with all the talk about strippers in movies

02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:39.140
during part A, I doubt

02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:44.620
it'll ever happen, but someone should make a game for Xbox 360 and

02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:49.220
PlayStation 3 where, you know, you go to a strip club and

02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:52.260
you know, you have boobies splashing in your face.

02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:56.660
Kind of like, I don't know, like Show of Girls type of game.

02:08:56.660 --> 02:09:00.300
That would be called This is Vegas coming out from Midway later this year.

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:03.220
Awesome. What about that Playboy game?

02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:06.980
The Playboy Mansion? Yeah, that was actually supposed to be pretty good.

02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:11.820
It was popular. You know, the problem is a lot of these games, you know, while you might see

02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:15.260
some boobs here and there, you're never gonna see anything pretty much

02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:19.020
more hardcore than that on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 because

02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:22.300
of the whole standards thing, where if you have,

02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:26.220
you know, if your game gets rated adults only, your game can't come out on any of

02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:28.420
the consoles. The consoles like basically forbid it

02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:32.060
because there's too many people out there who don't understand

02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:36.460
there's a developer who makes for the publisher who puts out on the system,

02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:40.800
you know, people think, oh, Nintendo Wii has got this disgusting,

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.700
you know, vagina-eating game that's out on the system,

02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:48.420
you know. When is that getting released? It's not,

02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:52.900
because it's rated adults only, so it's not like it used to be back in the day

02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:56.580
where, you know, remember that Nintendo

02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:59.860
seal of quality, you know, remember how those

02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:03.980
other companies would put out their own games without going through Nintendo and

02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:06.540
it was kind of like a whole bootleg thing. They can't really do that now, so

02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:10.340
sadly, I don't think you're ever gonna see real hardcore games get released, but

02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:13.700
you would wish one of them would just let up.

02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:16.940
Or you can just look at porn on the internet.

02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:20.260
There was that one game, there was some

02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:25.580
breast game that was, it was almost like DDR that had these little like circles come up

02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:26.060
with like

02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:29.420
arrows and stuff, and there are different moves you had to do, and basically you had to

02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:30.620
shake this chest

02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:34.020
and make the boobs either spin counterclockwise or clockwise or up and

02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:34.980
down, left or right.

02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:40.340
It was awesome. I don't know, porn on the internet's great, but I can see a

02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:42.620
lot of potential for the new

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:47.020
Wiimote technology in a porno game.

02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:52.540
Exactly. Especially if the vagina eating game was either pigs in a trough type

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:55.180
eating or knife and fork.

02:10:55.180 --> 02:11:01.100
Frisbee has a great name in chat for the game, Muff Chomp.

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:06.460
Wow. You know, since you kind of touched on it

02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.980
for a second, you know,

02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:13.060
this is just me, you know, speaking up on yes here, but

02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:16.260
what I'm thinking is that, you know,

02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:19.940
game console owners should be

02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:23.500
afraid of 8-year-old games, you know, I mean,

02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:27.380
you know, if it means light, there should be no problems with it,

02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:31.900
you know, it's kind of like, the best analogy I can give you is with

02:11:31.900 --> 02:11:36.740
Amrita games, you know, there's two out there that are like completely opposite,

02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:40.180
there's the Grand Theft Auto series and

02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:43.580
the BMX triple X. Obviously,

02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:46.820
you know, Grand Theft Auto games are really great,

02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:50.460
you know, my few niece here is out there,

02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:53.660
whereas, you know, BMX triple X

02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:58.580
is just a full piece of crap. I gotta get BMX triple X again, I love that game.

02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:01.500
Actually, I think my sister has it because I had it for the GameCube.

02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:07.020
That game is awesome. Loki really has like the best family ever, doesn't he?

02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:11.100
Like the wife goes to the GameCube, the sister plays BMX triple X.

02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:15.380
It was a funny game, it's seriously, it's Tony, it's not Tony Hawk, it's like Matt

02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:16.740
Hoffman's Pro BMX,

02:12:16.740 --> 02:12:21.100
but with like nudity and stuff, and just ridiculous plotline, but it's basically

02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:23.980
like the old school Tony Hawk game. You know what, though, Spassinator makes kind of a

02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:25.420
good point, though, is that, you know, we have,

02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:29.300
especially we have this whole dual thing in this country which stinks,

02:12:29.300 --> 02:12:30.700
this whole double standard where,

02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:34.180
you know, you could chop people in half and chop their heads off and have a

02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:35.900
completely violent game and it's just not,

02:12:35.900 --> 02:12:40.140
it's R or it's M rated, but heaven forbid you show a cooter or a penis

02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:44.020
and it's gonna be an NC-17 or AO related thing,

02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:48.140
but he makes a good point that, you know, a lot of the sex games that we've had that

02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:49.500
come out, like the guy game,

02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:52.980
BMX triple X, they've all been kind of crap, you know?

02:12:52.980 --> 02:12:56.820
What we need is a good artistic

02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:59.940
pussy eating game

02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:04.700
to come out, and we just need it to have, you know,

02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:08.220
a little bit of art. It'll be like Master Pussy Theater.

02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:12.260
Master Pussy Theater, exactly.

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:16.740
Yeah, if you want to really kick it over the edge there,

02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:20.340
you know, throw all that stuff in there, then just,

02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:23.380
you know, have like a side mission where you blow up a certain

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:27.060
ex-flory lawyer.

02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:31.940
I'm sorry, but Master Pussy Theater needs to be in the OLR dream games, I think,

02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:34.940
just for the simple fact that it is that artistic

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:38.420
sex game that's gonna bring respectability to

02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:42.500
sex games. I'm afraid of the fetish achievements for those games on the

02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:44.740
Xbox 360.

02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:48.140
Alright, Spazinator, we have to let you go. You've completely made this show

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.220
disgusting tonight.

02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:52.740
How dare you? You're welcome. Alright, take care Spazinator.

02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:54.900
Bye.

02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:58.780
AcidicVampire wants to remind us there's boobies in God of War in a sex minigame.

02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:03.140
There is. Hi, you're on Booby Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:06.340
Oh, Booby Lounge Radio! How exciting!

02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:10.060
Whoa! Hi guys, it's Jason. Hi Jason, how are you? What's on your mind?

02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:14.220
Well, now that you mention it, I don't know that I want to explain on air

02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:15.140
what's on my mind.

02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:19.740
What did you call in to discuss tonight with the Orange Lounge Radio host

02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:22.760
on this family program? As long as Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly

02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:27.580
are alive and spewing their shit, your dreams will never come true, I'm sorry to say.

02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:31.260
No, that's not why I called in, but it was very funny. It was a very

02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:36.300
funny anecdote to add into everything that just happened. I'm hoping somebody can answer me

02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:37.140
because

02:14:37.140 --> 02:14:41.420
obviously I heard this just recently and it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:45.780
Why does Gears of War need SSL and why does it stop the game from working?

02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:50.900
The whole Gears of War broken blah blah blah. Does anybody know the technical

02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:51.780
reason behind that?

02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:55.380
It's because the certificate expired.

02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:58.740
What is the certificate actually used for?

02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:03.140
Nothing. And it blocks the game in its entirety?

02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:08.100
Yeah, sure. I don't know. I don't play Gears of War on PC

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:11.780
and it's such an easy fix to set my date back, I'm like, eh, whatever.

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:15.900
Is it some type of thing to prevent cheating or the connection to

02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:17.700
multiplayer mode is secure or what?

02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:19.900
Maybe the authenticate that it's a legit copy of the game, I don't know.

02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:22.980
It's gotta be something like that, like authenticating the legitimacy of the game or

02:15:22.980 --> 02:15:26.300
something like that. I don't know. I don't think it has a direct impact on the

02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:27.700
game itself,

02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:31.220
Jason, or I think the 360 ones would have stopped working too. I think it has

02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:32.780
specifically to do with

02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:36.740
some type of authentication thing on the PC. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.

02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:39.660
Some kind of a phone home connection, something or other, and that's just,

02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:43.780
that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I mean, we've heard of some really

02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:45.260
stupid DRM, but

02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:49.300
for crying out loud people,

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:53.460
it's laughable. You put the situation where you have to,

02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:57.940
you have to have a patch. One of two things has to happen. You either have to

02:15:57.940 --> 02:15:58.500
buy

02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:01.980
a ridiculously expensive certificate for,

02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:05.660
I don't know, 10 years and then you piss off all the nostalgia players.

02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:09.260
Or you have to issue a patch every single

02:16:09.260 --> 02:16:13.740
year with a new certificate. Well, I think this is going to be a tough lesson learned because this is a

02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:18.420
pretty big fuck up to have your game completely stopped working. It's a bad setup. They need to get rid of that

02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:21.620
entirely. That is a bad

02:16:21.620 --> 02:16:25.220
mechanism. Okay, enough computer geekery.

02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:28.700
You guys mentioned that and I just kind of...

02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:32.620
They've been having trouble with this sort of thing way back from Monkey Island. They have yet

02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:38.420
to get this right. If you remember way back on the really old DOS games, you used to

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:40.900
buy a game and it'd come with a little booklet

02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:45.220
and at certain times you'd have to refer to page 193 line B65

02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:48.700
or you'd have some awful

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:51.820
little card you have to match up with the moon on

02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:56.660
the solstice of winter just to prove that you did in fact buy the game.

02:16:56.660 --> 02:17:01.340
And if you lose it, you're fucked! Some of those things weren't so bad and with the

02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:01.860
internet

02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:05.300
I've had a lot of things be subtly replaced.

02:17:05.300 --> 02:17:08.660
Anyways, Space Quest,

02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:11.700
the Space Quest series came with a

02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:14.900
brochure of sorts to explain about the game and it had

02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:18.300
in the case of Space Quest V, which was one of my favorite ones,

02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:22.300
it had like a star chart with constellation codes or

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:25.700
something like that and you had to use those codes to actually

02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:29.780
warp to different locales in the game as the story tells you to go there.

02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:32.980
And that was their DRM and it was good, it was cute.

02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:36.260
Jason, what I didn't like about that whole thing is that then console games started

02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:36.860
doing it

02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.580
and like, you know, if I didn't have that letter from home to dip in the water to

02:17:40.580 --> 02:17:41.900
see the secret code...

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:44.980
I didn't have that letter

02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:48.540
because I bought my game used and I had to call their helpline and I'm like,

02:17:48.540 --> 02:17:51.820
uh, they'll dip the letter in the water and I'm like, what letter?

02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:54.900
No, the one in the manual. I don't have the manual.

02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:58.940
Okay, the code's 747. Well, it wasn't that hard.

02:17:58.940 --> 02:18:02.500
Couldn't you just tell me that the first thing or do you like not get your 99 cents a

02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:03.900
minute if I, you know,

02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:08.020
give it away that fast? People will say that DRM is a necessary

02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:11.860
evil, I'll tell that person you're full of shit. By the way, yeah.

02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:15.100
It's self-serving and it only serves to

02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:18.500
fuck people over. Hold on, Nathan wanted to say something about Space Quest V.

02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:22.460
Did you also enjoy blowing up an android with a banana?

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:25.780
A space banana? That was, um,

02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:30.780
when I was a lot younger, the BBS's were around, but that was the extent of my

02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:31.620
online life.

02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:36.540
I love Space Quest IV. That was as far as I could get. I never got to the R&R world.

02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:40.100
So I, as many times as I played the game, I always

02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:45.780
oh, I don't even remember what that planet is called anymore. I always got that far and then that was the end of it.

02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:49.220
And that was the whole game for me for about five years of my life.

02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:52.820
I was more of a King's Quest player and I wish to God those games would come out on

02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:56.220
like Xbox Live Arcade, although they're on like GameTap and stuff, so you know.

02:18:56.220 --> 02:18:59.900
You're entirely wrong in your preference, but you know what, a lot of people were.

02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:04.460
Hey, King's Quest has that rabid fandom. I remember

02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:07.780
about a year or two ago on this show we had those guys- Silver lining?

02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:11.100
Yeah, the Silver Lining, which was originally like a King's Quest-inspired thing and

02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:13.980
then they were allowed to put it out if they ditched the King's Quest thing and

02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:15.940
you know, that whole mess that was going on there.

02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:20.180
I can't say anything bad about King's Quest. The Sierra Adventure games in general were really

02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:21.260
impressive. I just

02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:26.320
Hell yeah. I never had one. I never played one. Space Quest wasn't my series. Something sadly lacking in gaming

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:28.580
today unless it says Telltale Games on it.

02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:32.820
They're the only ones doing anything, you know? Anyhow.

02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:36.660
Anything else, Jason, you wanna talk about tonight before we get some other calls? Do you guys

02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:40.940
really think that Bioshock really needs multiplayer?

02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:44.780
No. I personally don't think it needs multiplayer. I think the first one was

02:19:44.780 --> 02:19:45.980
good enough as it is.

02:19:45.980 --> 02:19:48.980
But I can see why they want to put it in the second one

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:52.860
to definitely make it not feel like more of the same. Because you know,

02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:56.340
I think otherwise some people might start to say, well, it's more of the same.

02:19:56.340 --> 02:20:00.100
You know, it's another sci-fi. You know, no matter what the story is or what they do

02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:01.580
with it, there's gonna be people out there that say

02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:04.660
it's more of the same. But if they throw this multiplayer curve at it,

02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:07.820
people are gonna be like, oh my gosh, it's like the must-have game of

02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:10.980
da-da-da. You know, it almost makes me think they left it out. It makes it just like every other

02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:12.860
first-person shooter with a different weapon set.

02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:17.800
I mean, the one thing as much crap as I gave Bioshock because the

02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:18.380
ending,

02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:23.060
the last hour and a half or so of it just absolutely pissed me off. It was so

02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:27.900
boring and then it ended with the easiest boss battle I think I've ever seen in a game.

02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:31.420
Bioshock, what made

02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:35.340
the best thing about Bioshock was the story.

02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:38.700
It was interesting. It was scientific fantasy,

02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:42.100
sci-fi. It was a

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:48.220
good story. Being able to find the story and if you actually sat down and

02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:49.140
paid attention to it.

02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:53.080
I mean, you know, I'm not an ADD gamer so maybe I have a little bit of a

02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:55.380
different look on the game than some other people.

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:59.260
But the story made that game incredible

02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:02.620
until the end. But that was the best part about it and

02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:07.580
you lose all that in multiplayer. It's more... I really shouldn't say this, but it's more

02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:08.180
humdrum.

02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:11.660
It doesn't necessarily mean though, Jason, that the focus is gonna be on multiplayer.

02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:14.420
They might still have a very solid single-player mode in it and the

02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:16.700
multiplayer might just be an afterthought type thing.

02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:19.700
That's very true. I just did.

02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:23.860
A lot of... when you guys mentioned it and I went article surfing, it was just like

02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:27.580
they're finally getting multiplayer. Oh my god!

02:21:27.580 --> 02:21:32.380
Well, because there's a whole audience out there that does play first-person

02:21:32.380 --> 02:21:33.100
shooters to

02:21:33.100 --> 02:21:37.060
do the multiplayer and, you know, it was missing for them in the first Bioshock.

02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:40.580
Maybe they don't see the same thing in it. I can't talk it. It's just kind of... it

02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:43.900
seems overbearing in the pre... in everybody's view.

02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:47.700
We'll see. Alright, Jason, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls. But you have a

02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:48.120
good one.

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:51.380
Thanks, buddy. Fine. Jeez, come on. Sorry.

02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:54.420
We try to keep it to five minutes and you're on eight. Alright.

02:21:54.420 --> 02:22:01.420
See you, buddy. Bye. Bye. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is

02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:02.740
OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:06.900
SSJ100Matt says, apparently not having multiplayer in a game hurts a game.

02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:10.300
Sorry if Legend of Zelda doesn't have multiplayer. Hey, but there was that

02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:11.220
Four Swords game.

02:22:11.220 --> 02:22:15.100
That was kind of awesome. Remember that? On the GameCube? Yeah. I like that game.

02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:20.020
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? It's GS68.

02:22:20.020 --> 02:22:25.780
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind? Um, so I found out I'm playing DD Max Fever.

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:29.020
Oh, the new one in the US? The one that just came out?

02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:32.100
Yeah, the American one. And I know you're a big...

02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:36.820
It's a good game on its own. I mean, I know you're a pretty good pick from Portable 1 and 2, but

02:22:36.820 --> 02:22:42.700
as far as, like, buying it if you've already into the series, I can't really recommend it.

02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:47.500
I mean, you might as well just get Portable 1 and 2 and get the full silence from both games.

02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:52.260
Yeah, I'm kind of interested in your review here, because I know you're a big

02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:55.980
DJ Max fan, so it's kind of interesting to hear you kind of give this a negative

02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:56.900
review, but what if,

02:22:56.900 --> 02:23:00.340
what if I'm somebody, you know, because I am somebody, personally, who's not really

02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:03.860
played a lot of the DJ Max game? I mean, I have a friend that's obsessed with it, too,

02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:07.300
so I've, like, seen it. I've seen a couple of videos. I've not really sat down and

02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:08.980
spent any quality time with the game.

02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:12.840
Let's say I'm a person who's never really seen or heard of DJ Max before. Is this a

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.020
good introduction game?

02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:23.420
Um, I can't really say yet. I don't play it much, but it's pretty decent, but there's,

02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:29.260
one thing that's biting me about this game, and it's the whole author-correct feature.

02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:30.940
What is this feature?

02:23:30.940 --> 02:23:37.580
Basically, if you press the wrong button for a note, but at the right time, the phone is

02:23:37.580 --> 02:23:42.860
on the same side of the screen as the note is, you still get 100%, the full percentage

02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:48.300
for it, and you still get some points for it. And I'm on a game site as DJ Max Zero

02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:53.020
Board, and I'm seeing newbies saying, oh, so I can just press any button to play the

02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:58.460
game? So what's the point of the notes and such, and this, I think, is a bad idea.

02:23:58.460 --> 02:23:59.560
That is kind of strange.

02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:00.560
Yeah, because then you can just go like do-do-do-do.

02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:03.640
I don't really dubs it down. Yeah. You can't turn that off?

02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:04.640
Press two buttons, I think.

02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:05.640
This seems a little silly.

02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:11.860
I can't. I mean, yeah, you get 80% of the points, but you still get full credit as far

02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:14.260
credit as far as your percentage goes which means

02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:17.260
you can start pressing the wrong notes at

02:24:17.260 --> 02:24:20.520
all the time and still get one hundred percent

02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:23.980
percentage at the end of the song. Well now this begs the question who the hell did

02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:27.280
they make this game for then because you know i would think oh this is kind of

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:30.740
like you know a little reward for the people that have supported DJ Max in this

02:24:30.740 --> 02:24:33.880
country you know they're going to finally release it in the US but if most

02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:36.720
people that are interested in this game are people that have already imported

02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.740
the other copies then what the hell's the point

02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:42.620
because they didn't really put anything in this game to really woo a new audience to it

02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:46.560
you know and if they did it's the most casual of casual players who just want to slam any

02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:49.160
button they can to get a high score

02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:52.600
well they had to uh... the people that imported them

02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:56.620
you know they were real fans but this is one that they actually sent out to the

02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:59.220
stupid american pig dogs

02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:05.780
well it's not as bad as say butt and groovy

02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:06.860
i mean

02:25:06.860 --> 02:25:10.860
it is pretty good for a relief on its own but when you compare it to the other

02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:12.200
releases

02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:13.640
it feels kind of outdated

02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:14.520
and

02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:17.860
this one worked the exclusive songs and they're not that good

02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:22.780
well that's unfortunate i guess uh... who knows maybe maybe if it sells okay

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:25.380
they'll do another one maybe not

02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:29.280
i guess a few licenses would have hurt i mean hey they did positive edition which

02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:32.600
is a licensed game

02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.100
what's that

02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:36.240
i mean

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:39.340
yet i don't think that you have any if you like and that's one of her big area

02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:40.720
in

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:42.940
the report on the tradition is

02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:45.240
license

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:48.320
that's true i was saying the last thing on the show just needed a little bit of

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:51.440
americanization to help it penetrate the market even though it might have pissed

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:52.880
some of the hardcore fans off

02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:55.840
it would have in the long run benefit of the game is always sold more copies but

02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.560
no

02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.280
well anything else in your mind gs sixty eight

02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:03.640
uh...

02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:08.900
not much really yes i got popping music thirteen but and

02:26:08.900 --> 02:26:10.260
and uh... yeah

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:11.740
i'll do the status but

02:26:11.740 --> 02:26:14.240
maximum two and three dx came out but

02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:19.880
i don't want to talk about it because no one cares about it it's not that great

02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:22.760
it is a new course and

02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:25.000
has twenty more stages and

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.480
kind of that's about it basically

02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:31.380
alright well if fans of the series then should keep an eye out for that for more

02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:36.040

i had a great time well thank you so much for being here do you have any

02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:13.500
final thoughts for our listeners tonight

02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:20.260
resident evil five resident evil five oh i i should go to loki though first and ask if there's any last minute stories or he'll yell at me

02:27:20.260 --> 02:27:23.580
i'm not gonna yell at you i don't really care

02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:25.280
let's see here

02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:28.180
i was gonna say uh... there's a couple things real quick

02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:32.880
if you have a launched a three sixty it's no longer under warranty

02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:35.680
as of uh... february second

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.080
uh... your three sixty if it gets three rings of death

02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:40.220
you're screwed

02:27:40.220 --> 02:27:43.500
and you gotta pay ninety nine dollars get the unit fixed

02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.520
or

02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:49.920
just buy a new one

02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:52.780
or you just you know pay someone else to fix it for you

02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:54.340
for probably less

02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:58.440
if you uh... pay the ninety nine dollars to get it fixed is it uh... a new warranty

02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:01.120
or do you have to pay ninety nine dollars if it breaks the next day i

02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:05.400
think it's a one-year warranty

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:07.360
if mine red rings of deaths again

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:09.660
although i didn't get mine i mean i would still be covered i think for a

02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:12.120
couple more months

02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:13.560
i'm not sure actually

02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.460
how long was the warranty three years three years

02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:19.240
from purchase date i think mine's up in february you can well you can look on

02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:23.560
the back of your three six you'll say when it was manufactured and then some

02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:27.000
you know three years after that because i mean i've got

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.920
quite a few systems so

02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:33.080
luckily i think all mine have crapped out the ones that were going to crap out

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:37.280
i have one left that's of my original and i have my other one that i fixed

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:39.780
so the one that fixed is actually still working very well

02:28:39.780 --> 02:28:43.840
uh... and then i have one more that like i said that hasn't been replaced yet but

02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:45.840
all the other ones have so

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:50.600
you know four out of six is not a good uh...

02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:52.600
good ratio no

02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:56.680
