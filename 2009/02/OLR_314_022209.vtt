00:00.000 --> 00:19.960
Tonight, February 22nd, 2009, a new American McGee's Alice is announced, DSI and Rhythm

00:19.960 --> 00:29.960
Heaven get release dates, and will we soon be seeing more red on Xbox 360 elites?

00:29.960 --> 00:36.360
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.360 --> 00:41.260
Radio. We are that show that broadcasts live every week on AllGames.com, Sunday nights

00:41.260 --> 00:47.000
dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
is Rob Roberts, I'm here with you every week, as well as the one and only, Dark Sakura,

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Jamie Summers.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Hack.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
How are you doing?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hack.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hack, cough, die?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Yes.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
What are tonight's Oscars, which we're competing against, apparently?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Um, fart.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, fart, the motion picture, for best picture. Also say hello to tech master, Loki, who's

01:11.000 --> 01:13.320
chowing down on a sandwich over there. How you doing?

01:13.320 --> 01:15.320
It's not a sandwich, it's a burger.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.320
Oh, a burger, sorry. You guys are making me hungry, I haven't eaten dinner yet.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.320
Okay, fine.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.320
Alright, good, good. Any predictions for tonight's Oscars?

01:21.320 --> 01:24.320
Slumdog Millionaire is gonna win.

01:24.320 --> 01:29.320
Yeah, I think it's gonna be pretty anti-climatic in that way, but, you know, it's funny, having

01:29.320 --> 01:33.320
done this show on Sunday nights for the past, you know, what, seven years almost, this is

01:33.320 --> 01:37.820
like the fifth year or sixth year in a row, we're not able to watch the Oscars, so you

01:37.820 --> 01:39.320
kinda get to a point where you don't care anymore.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
I don't care.

01:40.320 --> 01:46.720
It's just an awards show, it's just another thing for people to, you know, pat each other

01:46.720 --> 01:50.920
on the back, whatever, and then charge millions and millions of dollars of advertising for

01:50.920 --> 01:51.920
it, so whatevers.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.520
Anyhow, let's get to a more important topic, and that is video games.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.520
Games.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.920
Or dark soccer, fine, we'll do both, dark soccer and video games. We'll always start

02:00.920 --> 02:04.420
off the show with how was your gaming week. So dark soccer, tell us a little bit about

02:04.420 --> 02:06.120
your gaming week.

02:06.120 --> 02:13.020
My gaming week was fantabulously uneventful, but hey, I did actually play stuff. I played

02:13.020 --> 02:20.560
some City of Heroes and more like made a whole bunch of costumes because it was fun, and

02:20.560 --> 02:26.020
I, actually Dan and I were watching videos last night comparing the different versions

02:26.020 --> 02:31.680
of, you know, the Oendon games and Elite Beat agents, and then we watched Wall Street Fighter,

02:31.680 --> 02:35.280
which is probably the most hilarious and wrong thing I've ever seen on the internet in my

02:35.280 --> 02:39.400
entire life this week.

02:39.400 --> 02:47.240
Also played some more Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game. I need to actually go back

02:47.240 --> 02:51.200
and work on my Symphony of the Night game since I've started it and got like to one

02:51.200 --> 02:54.880
save point and was like, haha, going to bed.

02:54.880 --> 03:02.940
Also, did some thinking about doing tabletop gaming and then went meh, so that's really

03:02.940 --> 03:07.200
about it for my gaming week. What about you, Loki?

03:07.200 --> 03:15.920
I played Eat the Burger. No, actually, I played a few things this week. Mainly Lost in the

03:15.920 --> 03:22.840
Damned, or Lost and Damned. I just wanted to add the other the in there. The new Grand

03:22.840 --> 03:29.680
Theft Auto expansion is pretty cool. It's short. I don't know, I kind of like the style

03:29.680 --> 03:36.960
of it more gritty. Some of the things that they've changed are good, some not so good.

03:36.960 --> 03:41.880
Especially with the multiplayer. For one, the helicopters, they really tweak. They gave

03:41.880 --> 03:48.760
the helicopters explosive rounds and they made them like, fragile. So you run into one

03:48.760 --> 03:53.360
little thing and your helicopter is on fire already. But, because they have explosive

03:53.360 --> 03:59.080
rounds, you can blow up a car and people really quick. So that's kind of annoying that they

03:59.080 --> 04:04.080
had to go and tweak all that. They really did the explosive rounds for that chopper

04:04.080 --> 04:09.200
versus chopper online mode, which is alright, I guess. But, you know, they could have just

04:09.200 --> 04:15.800
limited the explosive rounds to that mode instead of, you know, fucking everything up.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.960
Then they did some other stuff that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Now they have different

04:18.960 --> 04:24.600
preferences where you have to set your preferences on your phone before you can actually go into

04:24.600 --> 04:31.800
an online game. Say, for example, you're hosting one. Your preferences for auto-aim, for the

04:31.800 --> 04:39.440
cops, and for, well, if you're doing free mode, friendly fire on or off are locked into

04:39.440 --> 04:44.760
whatever your preferences are. You can't change it on there, which is really retarded. I understand

04:44.760 --> 04:49.480
why they did it for, you know, if you're searching for a game. But as far as hosting a game,

04:49.480 --> 04:52.680
you should be able to change those options without having to back out of everything and

04:52.680 --> 04:57.320
it's really retarded and caught us off guard with that kind of stuff. And, for free mode,

04:57.320 --> 05:01.920
they took out the helicopters. There's no fucking helicopters for no reason whatsoever.

05:01.920 --> 05:07.180
So that makes no sense at all. I don't know why they did that, so it just complicates

05:07.180 --> 05:12.400
things even more. It's just, why are you taking out options instead of putting, you know,

05:12.400 --> 05:16.680
options back in or putting additional options? Now, granted, you don't have to play these

05:16.680 --> 05:21.880
options on. It's only if you're playing The Lost and the Damned. But, I mean, it's still

05:21.880 --> 05:29.800
annoying. There's no reason to take the helicopters out. At all. But other than that, it's pretty

05:29.800 --> 05:33.600
fun. So, you know, what we normally do at lunch, you know, me and my friend, we just

05:33.600 --> 05:37.320
kind of shoot each other with the helicopters anyway, so we just play a deathmatch instead

05:37.320 --> 05:43.840
of free mode. Big deal, it's the same thing. So, that's fine. But, you know, the game itself

05:43.840 --> 05:49.200
is pretty fun and, you know, we'll be getting into a little bit more of it. There's some

05:49.200 --> 05:57.200
stuff they did for controversy that I don't get it and it's stupid but whatever. But yeah,

05:57.200 --> 06:00.920
it's kind of fun. But, sadly enough, I've only spent a few hours on it and I'm already

06:00.920 --> 06:05.680
almost done with it, so. Do you think overall it was worth the money that you have to pay

06:05.680 --> 06:12.040
for it? Yeah, it was enough. I got it for five systems, so. It was like pretty much

06:12.040 --> 06:15.560
buying a new game, wasn't it? How much is it? About fifteen bucks? Twenty bucks each.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.800
Twenty bucks, whew. I had store credit, so. Well, at least that's something. No actual

06:19.800 --> 06:26.720
money was being spent. That's good. And then, other than that, I also played Noby Noby Boy

06:26.720 --> 06:34.040
or like I'd refer it to Baby's First Tapeworm. Basically, this game, I haven't really figured

06:34.040 --> 06:39.480
out, I mean, obviously the point is to stretch as far as possible. I don't know how you do

06:39.480 --> 06:43.880
that, if you eat things. From what I found, eating things didn't really seem to do anything,

06:43.880 --> 06:50.600
but hey, maybe it does and I just don't notice it. But, basically, you're this kind of weird

06:50.600 --> 06:56.400
tube-like creature that looks like it could have been straight out of, you know, I don't

06:56.400 --> 07:02.400
know, just, of course, the Katamari universe and then everything that's pretty much in

07:02.400 --> 07:09.560
this looks like it's straight out of the Katamari universe. I don't know, it's a weird game.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.280
You kind of get bored with it after a while, but I've been trying to stretch my character

07:13.280 --> 07:17.640
out. I've gotten to the point where I'm so long that I actually, if I stretch out up

07:17.640 --> 07:23.160
or down, it'll go so far that it thinks I've fallen to my death, which, you know, you can't

07:23.160 --> 07:28.040
really die in the game, you just kind of pop back out of your chimney. But, you can eat

07:28.040 --> 07:34.300
things and then you'll poop them out. And it's funny, because stuff will explode out

07:34.300 --> 07:38.720
of your ass. Let's get some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.000
You can always join us when we tape live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard

07:42.000 --> 07:47.280
Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time. We got Biohaze starting us off tonight, making some comments

07:47.280 --> 07:51.120
on Grand Theft Auto 4. They took out Helis, I didn't know that, I haven't explored much

07:51.120 --> 07:56.720
anyway. It was worth it, especially that grenade launcher drool. The grenade launcher was kind

07:56.720 --> 08:04.200
of crap, but the auto shotgun's pretty sweet. But yeah, they took out helicopters out of

08:04.200 --> 08:08.320
free mode, only free mode though, so that doesn't make any sense. I don't get it. Comment

08:08.320 --> 08:14.080
from Tigerclaw, so Noby Noby Boy is like Snake, you get bigger as you eat stuff. Well, I don't

08:14.080 --> 08:18.600
know if that's the case, you just stretch. You have to like, kind of, um... Wouldn't

08:18.600 --> 08:23.000
stretch imply getting big? Yes, you stretch by getting bigger, but it's not necessarily

08:23.000 --> 08:27.840
eating things. You basically stretch out. I don't know if it's eating things that does

08:27.840 --> 08:32.320
anything. I don't even know what the eating things part does. But I've just been stretching

08:32.320 --> 08:37.000
by like, you know, tying myself around things and just kind of, you know. And it's weird

08:37.000 --> 08:41.280
though too, if you stretch too much, you'll break in half. Which is weird, because that

08:41.280 --> 08:44.800
caught me off guard. I'm like, what the hell, my guy just broke in half. But luckily if

08:44.800 --> 08:50.520
you hold the triangle button down, you'll spawn back into your house, and you'll be

08:50.520 --> 08:55.320
all one piece again. So I couldn't figure out, once I split in two, how to actually,

08:55.320 --> 09:01.280
you know, connect myself again. I tried eating myself, but that didn't work. And then, kind

09:01.280 --> 09:08.280
of along the same lines, I played a Flash game called Don't Shit Your Pants. What? Please

09:09.280 --> 09:15.200
explain. You're a guy standing there, and you have to take a shit, and you have to not

09:15.200 --> 09:19.800
shit your pants. It's a text adventure game. And basically you type in what you need him

09:19.800 --> 09:26.800
to do. You have to tell him to take off your pants, pull door to bathroom. Where did you

09:26.800 --> 09:32.040
find this game? You have him take off his pants before he opens the door to the bathroom.

09:32.040 --> 09:36.160
Well you can do it. Have you played this too? No. You can do it in any order, but yes, that's

09:36.160 --> 09:42.000
what you have to do. Take out pants, take off pants, pee, go in the bathroom. But you

09:42.000 --> 09:47.440
can like, you know, you can shit on the ground. The basic object of the game is not to shit

09:47.440 --> 09:52.320
your pants, but you can shit on the ground, shit in the toilet. They have ten different

09:52.320 --> 09:59.320
achievements for different things you can do. It's interesting. But yeah, that's pretty

10:01.520 --> 10:08.520
much my gaming week. Awesome. You know, what is it though with, did you find this game,

10:10.800 --> 10:15.160
because I noticed kind of a theme on PlayStation Network recently that a lot of their big games

10:15.160 --> 10:18.920
don't give you much explanation on what the hell to do with them. No, I didn't know what

10:18.920 --> 10:22.800
the hell I was supposed to do in that. It gave you nothing? It says there's no objective

10:22.800 --> 10:29.800
whatsoever, but like, you see the girl stretching out in the space, but you don't see how close

10:30.480 --> 10:36.080
she is to another planet or something like that, because she's just really fucking far

10:36.080 --> 10:41.240
out there. Has she hit the moon yet? She's probably gone beyond the moon, but the only

10:41.240 --> 10:47.480
planet you can play is Earth. And you can kind of generate new maps and stuff, but they're

10:47.480 --> 10:51.560
all kind of the same, and I didn't really get it, what I was supposed to be doing. If

10:51.560 --> 10:57.560
I was supposed to be eating stuff, or you know, what? Because I'd eat stuff and I'd

10:57.560 --> 11:02.920
kind of travel through my body like a snake, and then after a while, once I filled up,

11:02.920 --> 11:08.720
and I clenched down too much on my back end, it would poop it out with a nice fart. It's

11:08.720 --> 11:15.720
funny seeing people getting farted out, you know, single people at a time, and cats. I'll

11:15.720 --> 11:21.840
play it during the break. Alright, alright, I'll check it out. Let's see, I also played

11:21.840 --> 11:25.360
a pretty big release on the PlayStation Network this week that also gives you very little

11:25.360 --> 11:29.720
explanation on what the hell you're supposed to do. It's called Flower. Flower, I'd honestly

11:29.720 --> 11:34.280
best describe it. Honestly, it's a racing game, in my opinion. It's a very, very different

11:34.280 --> 11:38.240
type of racing game, but it's kind of a racing game. I don't know, maybe that's not the fairest

11:38.240 --> 11:43.400
way to describe it, but you certainly have an acceleration button, and you tilt to control

11:43.400 --> 11:48.440
it, but it's more of like a free reign thing. Basically, what you're trying to do, it's

11:48.440 --> 11:51.920
difficult to describe this game because there's no real demo for it, and the trailer doesn't

11:51.920 --> 11:56.960
give you an exact sense of what to expect from this game, but basically you start as

11:56.960 --> 12:01.640
a flower petal, and you travel through using the wind to accelerate and tilt, basically

12:01.640 --> 12:04.960
like you're controlling a car. I mean, they say you're using the wind and all this stuff,

12:04.960 --> 12:09.060
but basically you're controlling the flower petal like it's a car. You expand other flowers

12:09.060 --> 12:13.760
and collect their petals. So suddenly you're this giant stream of petals, but what you're

12:13.760 --> 12:17.600
trying to do is you're trying to, if you can unlock the flowers in certain patterns, then

12:17.600 --> 12:23.380
it causes the terrain to shift, like it might cause the wind to kick up and a cliff of rocks

12:23.380 --> 12:27.380
will topple over or something, so you have a new place to go. And it seems like in every

12:27.380 --> 12:32.160
stage, it adds a new element to it. Like in stage five, I think it is, there's electrical

12:32.160 --> 12:36.120
poles you don't want to touch or you get scarred. I don't know if you lose petals or what have

12:36.120 --> 12:43.320
you, but they're basically bad things. In one stage, you basically leave light trails

12:43.320 --> 12:47.700
wherever you go, and certain areas you want to paint with light, essentially, to get to

12:47.700 --> 12:50.840
the next area. You know, that being said, although this game sounds very kind of like

12:50.840 --> 12:55.820
artsy in design, it is. I mean, this game is beautiful. It's one of the most beautiful

12:55.820 --> 13:00.420
games I've played in a long time. I mean, it really does, especially in the high definition

13:00.420 --> 13:05.800
on the PlayStation 3, it really just looks like a painting in motion. I mean, this game

13:05.800 --> 13:11.200
almost seems like somebody sat there and said, you know, how can we show those assholes that

13:11.200 --> 13:17.340
say games are not art? What can we do to prove them wrong? And it seems like this game is

13:17.340 --> 13:23.340
almost like a byproduct of that. But, boy, the game is just gorgeous. I mean, especially

13:23.340 --> 13:26.920
when I was playing the night stage, which was like the fourth stage, it's a stage that

13:26.920 --> 13:30.560
takes place completely at night and you're basically painting with lights and everything.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.760
It's just, oh my gosh, the game is just beautiful. It's one of the most beautiful games I've

13:33.760 --> 13:39.480
played in a long time. For a download title, that's pretty impressive. So I really enjoy

13:39.480 --> 13:43.420
the graphics in the game. And, you know, although the game is a little simple, it's not going

13:43.420 --> 13:48.880
to take your whole day to beat it. I would say you can get through all six stages in

13:48.880 --> 13:55.960
about two hours tops, maybe three, I don't know. The game does leave some elements to

13:55.960 --> 14:00.980
be explored, such as there are secret pedals that you can find in stages. There are secret

14:00.980 --> 14:04.820
areas to go in in different stages. I mean, the game is very open. It doesn't give you

14:04.820 --> 14:08.720
a lot of description as to what you're supposed to do in the game, so there is a lot of exploration.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.760
That's a very big element. There's really a seventh stage, too, that's the credits,

14:12.760 --> 14:16.640
which plays slightly differently in which when you're exploding the flowers, basically,

14:16.640 --> 14:19.960
you're also collecting the letters of the staff in the game, which is kind of a cute

14:19.960 --> 14:27.440
idea. You know, and the trophies are, they're challenging, but not that challenging. You

14:27.440 --> 14:32.040
know what I mean? So it's pretty easy trophies, but will take a little of your time to get.

14:32.040 --> 14:38.960
All in all, I think it's a pretty good title for download. And $10 is a fair price, considering

14:38.960 --> 14:42.420
it's, you know, just the sheer beauty of the game, and I think it's something that's very

14:42.420 --> 14:46.720
easy to pick up. You use the X button, and you use six axis to play the game. That's

14:46.720 --> 14:51.040
it. You tilt the six axis to move, which doesn't play as bad as you might think, and you use

14:51.040 --> 14:53.880
the X to accelerate. That's it. That's basically the controls.

14:53.880 --> 14:59.640
That's the controls for Flow. Which was their other game. The same developers who made Flow.

14:59.640 --> 15:03.960
There's actually a Flow reference in the game, and one of the trophies you collect is Flow.

15:03.960 --> 15:09.200
A Flow trophy or whatever. So, yeah, I enjoyed Flower. I would say pick it up. I could see

15:09.200 --> 15:12.720
that they're probably going to expand this game later on, maybe with some extra stages

15:12.720 --> 15:16.500
and things, and I think that would be okay. I do think they need to put a demo out for

15:16.500 --> 15:21.160
it, so that people can really understand what it's about, but I understand because the game

15:21.160 --> 15:25.040
is a bit short. That's my biggest complaint about Flower is that it is a bit short, but

15:25.040 --> 15:31.060
I think, you know, ten dollars for an experience that I think most everybody in your house

15:31.060 --> 15:35.720
will kind of get a kick out of. You know, literally anybody can pick up this game and

15:35.720 --> 15:40.880
play. I think it's worth it. It's pretty cool. So, yeah, I do recommend Flower.

15:40.880 --> 15:45.680
Also, a big part of my gaming week was taken up by Street Fighter IV, which I picked up

15:45.680 --> 15:49.800
on the Xbox 360 as opposed to the Playstation 3. You know, I had decided last week I'm going

15:49.800 --> 15:54.080
to buy this on the Playstation 3 because I have Playstation 3 hooked up with HDMI, so

15:54.080 --> 16:01.120
my games look that slight bit better. It's hardly noticeable, though, and better controls.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.040
But then when I walked into the store, I was like, eh, you know what, achievements, more

16:05.040 --> 16:08.920
people I know on Xbox Live, I'm just going to get it on 360. So I did. I bought it on

16:08.920 --> 16:15.400
360. And the controls aren't terrible, but it is difficult, especially with some of those

16:15.400 --> 16:20.360
characters that really rely on rolling motions for their moves. For instance, one character

16:20.360 --> 16:24.800
I love to play is Fei Long. I think he's an awesome character. I love his moves. I love

16:24.800 --> 16:29.440
his fighting style. I like playing, I loved him in Super Street Fighter II. Turbo, I like

16:29.440 --> 16:35.280
playing him now. However, one of his special moves is basically, if you've not played him

16:35.280 --> 16:39.960
before, is basically three fireballs all in a row. If you want to do this ya ya ya thing

16:39.960 --> 16:45.920
all in a row, you have to do like three fireballs very quickly. And it's hard to do on the Xbox

16:45.920 --> 16:51.000
360 original controller. Very hard to do. It almost makes me think I'm going to need

16:51.000 --> 16:55.260
to pick up an arcade joystick if I'm really going to want to be able to be any good at

16:55.260 --> 16:59.000
this game, especially online. When I play characters like Chun Li, I don't have a problem

16:59.000 --> 17:03.920
at all, because most of Chun Li's moves are back and forth, or up to down, or back to

17:03.920 --> 17:13.120
forth. So, that's, you know, that's easy on the Xbox 360 stick. And I'm looking at

17:13.120 --> 17:17.680
chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, and Gunstar in chat says, get an arcade stick, Rob. And

17:17.680 --> 17:22.400
I'm thinking... Hey! Is that your husband? I think so. It might be. I know that's the

17:22.400 --> 17:27.500
name he'd use. You know, I might need to invest the money to get it. But the question, here's

17:27.500 --> 17:34.640
the question. Do I love Street Fighter IV that much? And I, granted, I could get use

17:34.640 --> 17:38.080
out of this on other fighting games I play. Like, Soul Calibur IV is pretty awesome. I'm

17:38.080 --> 17:42.780
sure there'll be, like, maybe I'll enjoy Super Street Fighter II Turbo Super Edition

17:42.780 --> 17:49.560
High Def a little more if I actually got an arcade stick. But, yeah, I don't know. That's

17:49.560 --> 17:53.260
a lot of money to drop on a controller. And I'm just worried I won't be playing this

17:53.260 --> 17:58.360
game that long. Some very obvious modes. I think we're left out of the game, which is

17:58.360 --> 18:03.520
a disappointment. I think it's kind of cool that you can turn on the mode where you, like,

18:03.520 --> 18:07.840
seek other players while you're playing arcade mode, basically. And you might, like, it gives

18:07.840 --> 18:12.440
that old, very old-fashioned feel of somebody walking up to the arcade game and just dropping

18:12.440 --> 18:15.760
a quarter in and challenging you. Which I think that was a really kind of neat mode

18:15.760 --> 18:19.920
to put in there, that you could always be seeking a player match or a battle match.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.000
Granted, if you're going to turn that mode on, you can expect you're always going to

18:23.000 --> 18:26.800
get challenged. At least right now. Probably after this game ages a few months, it'll get

18:26.800 --> 18:32.200
a little less. However, one mode they're missing, being able to set that to friends only is

18:32.200 --> 18:36.600
something I would really think would be an obvious mode that they did not choose to enable.

18:36.600 --> 18:42.080
Like, I would love to play with that mode on if only my friends could challenge me because,

18:42.080 --> 18:44.480
you know, and you might be thinking, well, why do you want to set it that way, Rob? Because

18:44.480 --> 18:50.800
I like to play with friends on Xbox Live more than I do random a-holes that sometimes, you

18:50.800 --> 18:54.480
know, I don't really want to play with. And Tiger Girl House says I have it turned off.

18:54.480 --> 18:59.560
I do most of the time, too. I spend most of my time with it turned off as well. But it

18:59.560 --> 19:03.080
would be cool. I would probably leave it on more often if friends could just walk up and

19:03.080 --> 19:08.800
challenge me. So. But yeah, for that reason, I choose not to leave it on.

19:08.800 --> 19:13.080
Otherwise, I think there's a lot of cool stuff in the game. I like that there's the challenge

19:13.080 --> 19:17.160
mode and the time attack mode and survival mode that all have, you know, they start off

19:17.160 --> 19:22.040
really easy. I mean, if you want to talk about an easy mode, something easier than easiest,

19:22.040 --> 19:27.280
go play, like, the first time attack mode where you basically have your super bars are

19:27.280 --> 19:33.000
always filled up. Go play that mode. That's super, super easy. I think it's really cute

19:33.000 --> 19:40.000
having the icons and the titles that are kind of separate from Xbox Live. So, yeah. It's

19:40.000 --> 19:47.080
a fun fighting game. $60, though? It's a lot of money to pay. And this whole accessibility,

19:47.080 --> 19:50.680
you know, I think the game is accessible if you've played Street Fighter II before. You

19:50.680 --> 19:53.760
know, I know it's been taking a little bit of crap for not being as accessible as they

19:53.760 --> 19:59.120
say it is in regards to the difficulty. And I'm not going to lie to you. Seth is a cheap

19:59.120 --> 20:05.380
bitch. He sucks, even on easiest mode. Sucks a lot. And some of the opponents start to

20:05.380 --> 20:08.280
really suck, too, when you get up there, even in, like, you know, medium and some of those

20:08.280 --> 20:15.660
other modes. However, what I loved about it is that I haven't really played a Street Fighter

20:15.660 --> 20:20.440
game hardcore since Super Street Fighter II Turbo. You know, there was a period of time

20:20.440 --> 20:24.080
where I didn't play a lot of video games, and it was mostly during college. Like, the

20:24.080 --> 20:27.840
only games I played were, like, Final Fantasy VII and Puzzle Fighter. And that was the period

20:27.840 --> 20:34.120
of time when we got Street Fighter III, Street Fighter Alpha, Capcom SNK, Marvel Capcom. You

20:34.120 --> 20:38.960
know, all those games kind of came out in that Dreamcast era that I kind of didn't play

20:38.960 --> 20:44.400
a lot of games through. And so, for me, I didn't play a lot of those games. I was able

20:44.400 --> 20:49.400
to pick up Street Fighter IV no problem. No problem. Because the moves are pretty much

20:49.400 --> 20:56.560
the same. So, yeah, I had a good time with the game. $60, though, that's a lot to ask

20:56.560 --> 21:02.420
for somebody, you know, that's based on nostalgia only. I would honestly recommend you play

21:02.420 --> 21:06.600
it at a friend's house first before you drop that kind of money. If you envision that this

21:06.600 --> 21:12.040
is a game you would play online a lot, if you are a fighting game fan at all, then definitely

21:12.040 --> 21:16.320
Street Fighter IV needs to be in your collection. But if you're, like, a casual fighting game

21:16.320 --> 21:20.640
fan like me, you're not so sure, you might want to rent or play it at a friend's house

21:20.640 --> 21:27.000
first. Just because of the controls and the longevity of the game for $60, which is a

21:27.000 --> 21:32.840
lot of money in this day and age. So. But overall, I would give the game a good review.

21:32.840 --> 21:37.520
As you would, too, right, DarkSakura? Give it a good review. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. Alright.

21:37.520 --> 21:42.000
Awesome. Looking at some comments in chatroom, Gunstar says, Seth is the worst last boss

21:42.000 --> 21:49.360
in the history of last bosses. And SSJ100Matt says, Seth isn't as bad as Gil. So. I do have

21:49.360 --> 21:55.080
to admit that Gil's a bastard. They're all bastards. Alright, that's going to do it for

21:55.080 --> 21:58.740
my gaming week. I don't want to go on forever. We have some news we want to get to tonight.

21:58.740 --> 22:03.140
Let's get to some housekeeping. And there isn't a lot right now, I do want to point

22:03.140 --> 22:07.960
out at Orangelaunchradio.com, very cool new feature where our podcasts, when we get them

22:07.960 --> 22:12.240
to the feed, which by the way, I got caught up tonight. There's one more waiting to go

22:12.240 --> 22:15.880
to the feed and it'll be all caught up. They show up, I think, on the front page of the

22:15.880 --> 22:20.880
feed when I push them out there. Actually, now it's disappeared in favor of Justin.tv,

22:20.880 --> 22:25.320
so I'm not sure what's going on right now. But you can check that out always at Orangelaunchradio.com.

22:25.320 --> 22:28.720
That is cool that when we are live, the Justin.tv is right there, even though our listeners

22:28.720 --> 22:32.360
are telling us it's down right now. So I don't know what's going on with that. We'll see.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.520
I don't know, they said Justin.tv was down. I don't know if it came back up. Whatever.

22:35.520 --> 22:41.000
But again, remember folks, Justin.tv is priority number two, because we are a radio show.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.200
Disconnected again.

22:42.200 --> 22:47.040
Weird. We are a radio show, not a TV show, so Justin.tv is not priority number one. So

22:47.040 --> 22:51.880
it is going to go down occasionally and that just sucks. So make sure you always tune in

22:51.880 --> 22:58.960
to AllGames.com. Anyhow, also our live journal community, all the communities are right there

22:58.960 --> 23:04.680
on Orangelaunchradio.com. If you want to find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners, very

23:04.680 --> 23:08.920
cool community, just nice people. You know, we don't like jerks in our community. Or if

23:08.920 --> 23:13.280
you want to find us, look at the little box that says Extended Play on Orangelaunchradio.com

23:13.280 --> 23:18.480
in the bottom left hand corner. It's awesome. It directly links you to Facebook, Last.fm,

23:18.480 --> 23:24.400
MySpace, YouTube, even though we haven't updated YouTube in forever, OLRPSP.com. It's awesome.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.400
So check that out.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.400
Alright.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.520
Rob, I have to ask something and I'm going to actually put this up on our gallery. Is

23:30.520 --> 23:32.180
that your printer?

23:32.180 --> 23:33.180
That one on the floor? Yes.

23:33.180 --> 23:35.520
That's my printer. Your printer looks like an ice chest.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.520
It does, doesn't it?

23:36.520 --> 23:40.940
I'm putting this up. Go to our gallery because we've been putting pictures up on it. I've

23:40.940 --> 23:45.320
been taking tons of pictures. So I'm taking a picture of the messy floor.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.960
And other people can submit pictures too. But I swear to God, the first time somebody

23:48.960 --> 23:53.160
submits a picture that is inappropriate, we're pulling the plug on that thing.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.600
No boobs. Okay. Well, no boobs. We should have a special thing.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.620
Actually, I'm okay with boobs as long as they're covered boobs. We probably, you know, we do

24:00.620 --> 24:07.080
have young kids that look at the website. But like dead or alive boobs are fine. So,

24:07.080 --> 24:13.240
alright. Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, shall we, Loki?

24:13.240 --> 24:19.040
Yes. So there was, of course, the release this week of Lost in Damned. And with it was

24:19.040 --> 24:24.520
a little bit of controversy. Starting off, the bit that I don't really get why it was

24:24.520 --> 24:31.880
in there, but it was. Apparently, there was full frontal male nudity in Lost in Damned.

24:31.880 --> 24:38.800
Actually, one of the characters that you talked to, Mr. Stubbs, is in a...

24:38.800 --> 24:43.760
I'm sorry. That's just funny right there. That the character's name is, you know, Stubby.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.240
Mr. Stubbs, yes. He's actually...

24:45.240 --> 24:49.120
Is Stubby chubby? I have not seen the scene. Contrary to what you all might think, I have

24:49.120 --> 24:53.520
not went and looked at the scene because I think the whole thing is a little silly.

24:53.520 --> 25:01.680
It's just whatever, you know. It's full frontal, whatever. So, yeah. So, he's there, you know,

25:01.680 --> 25:07.760
completely naked because he's in a bathhouse. And, yeah. He's all hanging out. And everyone's

25:07.760 --> 25:11.840
like, oh my god, why'd they do that? And you know what? I have to say, why did they do

25:11.840 --> 25:15.960
that? Because here's my thing. If they can put full frontal male nudity in this, why

25:15.960 --> 25:21.300
aren't the strippers topless? That's what I want to know. I mean, because that's the

25:21.300 --> 25:26.840
lesser of two evils right there. I don't get why that's the case. But, whatever. So, yeah.

25:26.840 --> 25:33.400
That's in the game. It's really minor. No big deal. But, just in case. So, there you

25:33.400 --> 25:40.440
go. Some other stuff that was interesting. There was some censorship tweaks on the European

25:40.440 --> 25:48.440
Australian versions of the game. First off, the European versions. Apparently, their versions

25:48.440 --> 25:54.520
of Grand Theft Auto 4 have been censored with the update. This is, of course, by accident.

25:54.520 --> 26:01.520
However, you know, Rockstar is working on it right now so that, you know, it will be

26:01.520 --> 26:07.560
fixed momentarily, I guess. Maybe within a few days if it hasn't already been fixed.

26:07.560 --> 26:16.680
And then, of course, Lost and Damned in Australia has undone the censorship that was actually

26:16.680 --> 26:23.760
with it. Basically, the censorship that's going on. There's no blood pools. The camera,

26:23.760 --> 26:30.440
when you get, you know, services from a prostitute, you can normally move the camera around to

26:30.440 --> 26:38.160
get better angles and stuff. But, in censored versions, it's not. But, apparently, yeah.

26:38.160 --> 26:43.640
The Lost and Damned actually reverted the censorship on the Australian version. So,

26:43.640 --> 26:48.760
that's kind of interesting. Whatever, it's a cock. Obviously, they're

26:48.760 --> 26:53.560
just trying to ruffle some feathers with this and they've succeeded. I mean, whatever. You

26:53.560 --> 27:00.900
know, I like, though, that at least it's not, like, sexualized. It's there to accomplish

27:00.900 --> 27:04.780
one thing. It's there to get people talking. Well, mission accomplished because here we

27:04.780 --> 27:09.780
are in our little crappy podcast talking about your full frontal male nudity in a game that,

27:09.780 --> 27:16.140
you know, is completely random. Rob. Rob. Just say it. Cock. Exactly. It's just a cock.

27:16.140 --> 27:20.920
It shouldn't be that big of a deal. But, at the same time, I would not suddenly want there

27:20.920 --> 27:26.400
to be, like, random cocks in all my games. You know what I mean? Like, you know, suddenly

27:26.400 --> 27:32.040
it's, oh my god, a cock monster in Final Fantasy. We need more penis in video games. But, to

27:32.040 --> 27:36.720
be fair, if we're going to have more penis, then we need more vag. Right? Just play Second

27:36.720 --> 27:40.960
Life. Oh, hi Drew, by the way. We had some guests randomly show up during that comment.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.960
Everybody introduce themselves real quick. Who's here and everything? Say hello. Uh oh.

27:45.960 --> 27:52.360
Uh oh. Oh, we had a spillage on the laptop in here. Introduce yourselves. I'll run in

27:52.360 --> 28:05.360
and get a paper towel for Jimmy. It's Drew, as usual. Uh, hi. We have Danny. Camara. Yeah.

28:05.360 --> 28:12.360
Rob has salvaged my laptop because I'm actually trying not to move my laptop, so, um, that

28:12.360 --> 28:22.360
was me last week. Did Joe say hi? No, I didn't. Hi. But they know you better as Dark Tetsuya.

28:22.360 --> 28:27.360
Alright, awesome. Welcome, Dark Tetsuya, and, uh, friends, everybody's here tonight. If

28:27.360 --> 28:31.600
my laptop catches on fire, it's Rob's fault. Okay. Well, it's not my fault. You spilled

28:31.600 --> 28:40.280
something on it. You startled me, Rob, with your Rob-ness. It's not my fault if you got

28:40.280 --> 28:44.360
excited. Now my laptop smells like Propel. It is not my fault if you got excited at us

28:44.360 --> 28:50.760
talking about the story about Cocks and Vag, okay? But we need more games with you. I agree.

28:50.760 --> 28:55.040
You know what? If they're gonna have this game with ultra-violence, then why not ultra-nudity,

28:55.040 --> 29:00.640
you know? Well, they have paces. I mean, come on. It's just a little bit more flesh. Who

29:00.640 --> 29:05.880
cares? I mean, if you're gonna show, you know, cock and balls, I mean, they can seriously

29:05.880 --> 29:11.560
just put boobies in there. I mean, I don't get it. I agree. They should be fair and have

29:11.560 --> 29:16.800
some boobs in it, too, but, you know, whatever. Whatever. I just don't even care. I don't

29:16.800 --> 29:21.120
know why people care so damn much. I mean, I understand it's because we've never really

29:21.120 --> 29:26.400
seen this in a game before, OMG. Someone's gotta do it. Whatever. May as well be them.

29:26.400 --> 29:31.120
Yeah, may as well. Get it over with. But, you know, who knows? Maybe Cocks the Game

29:31.120 --> 29:38.280
coming soon, thanks to all of this. Who knows? Bubble Bath Cocks. I don't know. We'll see.

29:38.280 --> 29:46.720
I somehow doubt it. Imagine Cocks, exactly. We'll see. Anyhow, moving on to other stories.

29:46.720 --> 29:49.800
Street Fighter IV obviously was a big title this week. We talked a little bit about that

29:49.800 --> 29:55.200
during our gaming weeks. And, for those that have played Street Fighter II back in the

29:55.200 --> 29:59.440
day, one thing you probably noticed was that some of the characters were missing from Street

29:59.440 --> 30:04.560
Fighter II. Namely, DJ and T-Hawk. They were two of the new characters when Super Street

30:04.560 --> 30:08.800
Fighter II came out. They were not included in Street Fighter IV, and I kind of say, so

30:08.800 --> 30:13.440
what? I mean, these characters weren't exactly popular or good in the first place. Sorry,

30:13.440 --> 30:18.740
in my opinion. Bite your tongue. I didn't care for either one of them. I own people

30:18.740 --> 30:24.960
with DJ, by the way. DJ was alright, but T-Hawk especially I didn't care for. Although his

30:24.960 --> 30:28.520
stage music was awesome. You're such a cheap bitch if you know how to use them. Well, anyway,

30:28.520 --> 30:34.400
they weren't there. But see, instead of these two, you got Rose, Sakura, Dan. You know,

30:34.400 --> 30:38.320
you got characters from later in the series. In my opinion, it's worth the exchange, but

30:38.320 --> 30:44.320
whatevs. Oh, hell yeah. But anyhow, see, Gunstar agrees with me in chat, because DJ and T-Hawk

30:44.320 --> 30:51.920
suck. However, all hope may not be lost for DJ and T-Hawk fans. Yoshinori Ono, who is

30:51.920 --> 30:56.880
the producer of Street Fighter IV, has kind of teased the idea of these guys appearing

30:56.880 --> 31:01.860
later on, and this was in Famitsu magazine. He actually said that some 3D models were

31:01.860 --> 31:06.160
created. I'd like to see pictures of that. I bet that would be pretty cool. They actually

31:06.160 --> 31:11.400
went so far as to actually plan out the combat style for T-Hawk, but they got cut before

31:11.400 --> 31:16.720
the game actually came out. However, Ono did say if the fans want it bad enough, the characters

31:16.720 --> 31:21.600
could be added at a later date. How would that happen? Could that be download content?

31:21.600 --> 31:26.680
Could that be a re-release of the game? I think that's more likely. I see, I actually

31:26.680 --> 31:31.520
see download content, and then a gold edition later, like how they did with Marvel Ultimate

31:31.520 --> 31:35.760
Alliance. Right, but here's the thing with download content. If they didn't already plan

31:35.760 --> 31:41.520
for these two guys to be download content, what happens if one of my friends downloads

31:41.520 --> 31:47.200
it and has T-Hawk and then fights me online? I don't have T-Hawk. What happens? Because,

31:47.200 --> 31:54.720
yeah, Drew, you have a thought? Yeah, Push and Update, like they do with, say, the Dawn

31:54.720 --> 32:01.200
of War games, the RTS games, where one player doesn't have access to a certain set of races

32:01.200 --> 32:06.600
to play as. It's like, okay, you can only play against these players playing these characters.

32:06.600 --> 32:14.400
It'd be a little complicated, but it would be a solution. Or have a light pack downloaded

32:14.400 --> 32:21.240
where you have the characters there, you just can't select them. You know, kind of like

32:21.240 --> 32:25.520
you could get to, what was it they did for Fable 2, where you could, you know, go to

32:25.520 --> 32:31.120
that area but you didn't have all the stuff that went with it. Can I say, can I say something

32:31.120 --> 32:35.120
a little controversial about Street Fighter 4, and maybe I'm going to get shit for this,

32:35.120 --> 32:39.760
I don't know. It's honestly, no no no, it's honestly something I noticed, especially talking

32:39.760 --> 32:46.040
about DJ getting cut from the game and all this stuff. Where are the black people in

32:46.040 --> 32:51.440
Street Fighter 4? Really? This is an obvious question. There's Balrog. Balrog, that's it.

32:51.440 --> 32:57.680
One out of how many? Most everybody in the game is Asian, Rob. But it's like white people

32:57.680 --> 33:01.240
beating each other up the game, is what it is. No, it's Asian people beating up the white

33:01.240 --> 33:06.540
guys the game. But where's like, you know, well I guess you have one Indian guy too,

33:06.540 --> 33:09.720
and you know, I don't know, it just seemed like these guys, you know DJ and T-Hawk, T-Hawk

33:09.720 --> 33:15.560
especially was a little more ethnic, like not a type you see in like other games, right?

33:15.560 --> 33:24.240
And yeah, he's like, um, I realize it's a little bit, it's a small world-ish, but what?

33:24.240 --> 33:30.140
It's a Japanese anime-ish fighting game. Do you really expect that much racial diversity?

33:30.140 --> 33:34.640
I'm just saying, there's, listen, there was Def Jam. The game's a little white, that's

33:34.640 --> 33:43.560
all I'm saying. No, the game's a lot Asian. Listen, okay, you have 50 Cent, you know,

33:43.560 --> 33:49.680
Blood in the Sand coming out this week, it evens itself out, okay? It's AZN for reals,

33:49.680 --> 33:56.640
yo. So deal with it. Chat room, am I wrong? Am I, am I a bad person for thinking this?

33:56.640 --> 34:00.480
Tell him he's wrong and he's a bad person for thinking it. Biohaze says black people

34:00.480 --> 34:05.600
are non-existent in the Street Fighter universe. That's not true, Balrog. Yeah, since the beginning.

34:05.600 --> 34:11.080
Gunstar says Sagat is kind of like a brother and he kicks ass. He's Thai. And Game Guru

34:11.080 --> 34:15.400
says DJ was created by Capcom USA. That's true, that's something I didn't think of.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.720
Remember when they did Super Street Fighter? He was the character of the USA, made good,

34:18.720 --> 34:26.240
good observation, Game Guru. Unfolded Raptor wants to point out there are green people.

34:26.240 --> 34:30.960
So Biohaze says no more Mexicans. Can we have someone from Central or South America for

34:30.960 --> 34:42.880
once? We have Blanca. Yeah, that's kind of a pity. Anyhow, all right. Jimmy! Rolling

34:42.880 --> 34:48.560
and rolling. I'm sorry, go look at Dan's ending for Street Fighter 3 and you'll know what

34:48.560 --> 34:51.920
I'm talking about. I don't know. And then I could also say, you don't really have a

34:51.920 --> 34:57.160
gay fighter either, but then people would say Vega, but Vega's not gay, he's just an

34:57.160 --> 35:04.480
asshole. No, I think he's very gay. He's just kind of, here's the thing, he's not gay, he's

35:04.480 --> 35:12.120
just queer. There's a difference. I think that Vega, actually I think Vega, well, off

35:12.120 --> 35:20.160
camera really is a major, major cross-dresser, a drag queen, seriously. With all that attention

35:20.160 --> 35:28.080
to his face, drag queen. Those shoes, look at the heels on those shoes. Drag queen. Act

35:28.080 --> 35:35.680
Deaf says he's just metrosexual. Drag queen. All right, please can we change the topic,

35:35.680 --> 35:40.200
somebody else. Oh, Dark Soccer, do you have a story for us maybe? I do, speaking of drag

35:40.200 --> 35:46.440
queens, I'm kidding. So how many people in here liked American McGee's Alice? We had

35:46.440 --> 35:54.040
two hands next to me, shoot up and a ding. Well, there's going to be another one. They're

35:54.040 --> 36:01.120
saying that it will not be out for a while, but it's going to be out for PC, PlayStation

36:01.120 --> 36:10.440
3, and Xbox 360, and basically saying that EA is behind it along with American McGee

36:10.440 --> 36:16.920
and we should be getting it out. So, yay. And they said it's going to be darker. Yeah,

36:16.920 --> 36:23.560
the picture that they, more darker. The picture they were teasing it with were like a bunch

36:23.560 --> 36:28.400
of snails trying to attack. It's the racing snail. Do you think this could be because,

36:28.400 --> 36:31.000
I don't know if you guys know, but there's a new Alice in Wonderland movie coming out

36:31.000 --> 36:35.440
next year. It's being done by Tim Burton and like Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter. The guy

36:35.440 --> 36:39.480
from Little Britain is Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. You know, they have, they have some pretty

36:39.480 --> 36:44.240
interesting casting. The big guy from Little Britain is Tweedle Dee. Oh. Yeah. You know,

36:44.240 --> 36:47.640
they have some interesting casting choices. Maybe because they're thinking they're going

36:47.640 --> 36:52.440
to kind of catch this Alice craze that might start again next year because of the movie.

36:52.440 --> 36:56.240
That seems kind of smart to me. Why not? Because if it's being done by Tim Burton, it's going

36:56.240 --> 36:59.240
to be probably a little dark in the first place, so this will kind of fit in nicely.

36:59.240 --> 37:04.480
Tim Burton needs to get over himself though, really. What? I love Tim Burton movies. There's

37:04.480 --> 37:07.840
very few Tim Burton movies. There's a man though who has gotten too full of himself

37:07.840 --> 37:11.680
and too stuck on his style. Well, I don't, ok, I don't listen to him in interviews, granted.

37:11.680 --> 37:16.120
I don't know the person, I just know his movies. And you know, I like the movies. At least

37:16.120 --> 37:26.160
he's not George Lucas. At least there's always that. Going to chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com,

37:26.160 --> 37:35.040
VXJsonXV says, I like how Dark Sakura is personifying a made up character. Hence Vega. DJ Rama S

37:35.040 --> 37:41.960
asks, ok Skye, would you date Vega? No, but I have dated guys that were that self-centered.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.840
Just so you know. But no, I would not date Vega based on previous experience. So there

37:45.840 --> 37:51.800
you go. And the City Vampire simply says Tim Burton needs a haircut. Yeah, that I would

37:51.800 --> 37:57.880
agree with. Alright, more gaming news, Loki. Alright, first I have a bit of random stuff

37:57.880 --> 38:01.480
while you guys are talking. I was trying to figure out exactly what you have to do in

38:01.480 --> 38:07.920
Noby Noby Boy. Which apparently is eat things. But the other thing I found out is that you

38:07.920 --> 38:12.960
can eat a human and like an animal or a human and a fruit or something like that. And it

38:12.960 --> 38:20.220
will create hybrid creatures when it poops it out. So you want, you can actually create

38:20.220 --> 38:28.560
ManBearPig? Yes. In your anus? In your anus. Nice. Alright. Well, something not quite as

38:28.560 --> 38:37.000
exciting as anus ManBearPig. EA has announced a port of Dead Space for the Wii. It's actually

38:37.000 --> 38:42.200
Dead Space Extraction. It's gonna be an on rail shooter because obviously the Wii can't

38:42.200 --> 38:50.680
really hold up, you know, the graphic detail of the 360 and PS3 versions. But it will be

38:50.680 --> 38:57.480
kind of, I guess, a little bit like, I guess, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles. But with

38:57.480 --> 39:08.720
Dead Space stuff. So new weapons, new enemies, puzzles, co-op multiplayer. Sounds kinda cool.

39:08.720 --> 39:12.280
I like light gun shooter games on a, you know I still haven't played the House of the Dead

39:12.280 --> 39:16.960
one that just came out. That looked interesting though. That one didn't just come out, did

39:16.960 --> 39:20.320
it? It was a little while ago, wasn't it? Well, House of the Dead Overkill, that came

39:20.320 --> 39:23.960
out a couple weeks ago. Oh, I didn't realize it was so recent. Was there another, oh no,

39:23.960 --> 39:28.760
it was a compilation of prior games, that's right. That was a year ago. Got it a little

39:28.760 --> 39:34.880
mixed up. So, alright, well, you're a fan of rail shooters, Dark Soccer, is this something

39:34.880 --> 39:40.080
you might get? I don't know. Kind of see a little more. Yeah, no word on when it's gonna

39:40.080 --> 39:45.120
be released. I'm sure you'll see a little bit more on it at E3. It's supposed to come

39:45.120 --> 39:51.300
out this fall though. November probably. Alrighty. Well hey, moving on to a completely different

39:51.300 --> 39:56.400
type of game. Leisure Suit Larry. Remember the old Sierra series, Leisure Suit Larry?

39:56.400 --> 39:59.840
You want to talk about the original boobs in video games. You gotta go all the way back

39:59.840 --> 40:03.880
to Leisure Suit Larry. And, you know, they tried to bring the series back a couple years

40:03.880 --> 40:08.120
ago with a game that was kind of, eh, it was like a lukewarm reception game. And so we

40:08.120 --> 40:12.880
kind of thought, eh, this series is probably gone and best remembered in our memory. Well,

40:12.880 --> 40:21.040
guess what? Apparently, Leisure Suit Larry Box Office Bust was, it was a game that was

40:21.040 --> 40:25.480
kind of cut to the side after Activision and Blizzard merged. You might remember people

40:25.480 --> 40:28.520
were talking about Ghostbusters and Brutal Legends and some of these games. Not a lot

40:28.520 --> 40:34.040
of people were talking about Leisure Suit Larry. Well, apparently Codemasters has actually

40:34.040 --> 40:39.800
jumped in. It's one of their other branches, Funsta, which is a casual game branch of the

40:39.800 --> 40:44.840
company. So that's a little interesting in my opinion. But they have picked up the publishing

40:44.840 --> 40:48.760
rights to the game. And the game is gonna come out in April. It's gonna be on the PC,

40:48.760 --> 40:55.480
Playstation 3, and the 360. And yes, it's been rated mature by the ESRB. No word if

40:55.480 --> 41:01.360
there's cocks. Um. There's probably some hits though. This will probably be very similar

41:01.360 --> 41:06.040
to the last game that came out. Yeah. Cause that was very casual, it was all minigames.

41:06.040 --> 41:11.320
I hope they don't try to charge $60 for it. Are they just, is it just gonna be- No, actually

41:11.320 --> 41:16.920
from what I read it's supposed to be $40. Is it just gonna be dirty casual games? It'll

41:16.920 --> 41:21.520
probably be- Let me see. The last game that came out, the casual games that they had in

41:21.520 --> 41:28.600
there. They had, I don't know if they had streaking in there. I remember there was Quarters.

41:28.600 --> 41:33.160
And they had this little, it was fun. It was a little minigame that you had to, you were

41:33.160 --> 41:37.840
a little sperm and you had to dodge. That was the minigame I played at E3 a couple years

41:37.840 --> 41:42.680
ago. Yeah, you had to dodge something. I don't remember what it was. Stuff. During the conversation,

41:42.680 --> 41:48.120
depending on how well you did, your conversation would be smoother or whatever. You'd talk

41:48.120 --> 41:53.400
right out of her clothes. But if you hit stuff you'd like fart or like make, you know, stupid

41:53.400 --> 41:58.200
comments and stuff like that. So it was pretty funny. I don't know, I kind of liked the last

41:58.200 --> 42:05.840
game. But yeah, this one, I don't know. I'll check it out. But who knows. Alright, we'll

42:05.840 --> 42:10.160
see. More information I guess on this to come. Probably a little closer to the release date

42:10.160 --> 42:16.400
in April. Well, other stuff that's happening near April is a particular game that was very,

42:16.400 --> 42:24.040
very popular on Xbox Live Arcade coming to PC on March 31st and that would be Braid.

42:24.040 --> 42:32.920
And it's getting a price mark up to 20 bucks. Think it's worth it? Well, it actually, they

42:32.920 --> 42:36.600
were going to raise it to 20 bucks, but they ended up bringing it back down to 15. But

42:36.600 --> 42:41.240
wasn't it only 10 on Xbox Live? Or was it 15 on Xbox Live? I can't remember. It's been

42:41.240 --> 42:46.440
a little while. Yeah. You know, it was one of my favorite games that came out last year.

42:46.440 --> 42:50.560
Yeah, yeah, it's worth it. I wouldn't say buy it on both systems. I don't see the point.

42:50.560 --> 42:55.840
But if you don't have a 360, yeah, you should buy it. It's a fun game. Well, good for Braid

42:55.840 --> 43:03.360
fans. Indeed. You said you hadn't played the game, right? Nope. Do you think you might

43:03.360 --> 43:10.320
check it out on PC? Nope. All right. It was worth asking. When do I have time? And the

43:10.320 --> 43:14.360
chat room is confirming for me that Braid was 15. You know, it came out a long time

43:14.360 --> 43:21.520
ago. I thought it was 10. So sue me. ActDeft begs to differ in our chat room. Chat.honors.radio.com

43:21.520 --> 43:26.640
says Braid isn't really worth it. I think it is. I think it's a very different type

43:26.640 --> 43:30.600
of puzzle game. It's like Mario is a puzzle game, which is, I don't know. It was very

43:30.600 --> 43:36.920
entertaining to me. It was all right. I liked it a lot. And yes, I agree with Acidic Vampire.

43:36.920 --> 43:41.320
The soundtrack is beautiful. Sorry, I'll stop interrupting. Speaking of the 360, there

43:41.320 --> 43:51.040
is more confirmation of a rumor red Xbox 360 system coming soon. Apparently, the red Xbox

43:51.040 --> 43:58.960
360 elite system was mentioned in a Microsoft press release from New Zealand, and it was

43:58.960 --> 44:04.280
saying that there was some sort of deal going on where you buy a 360 and get a free copy

44:04.280 --> 44:13.840
of Halo Wars, and that the red Xbox 360 elite console, which is exclusive to EB Games. So

44:13.840 --> 44:21.380
I guess it's exclusive to EB Games there. Hmm. Maybe there's a red system coming out.

44:21.380 --> 44:27.600
Maybe it's going to come out with Resident Evil. Maybe soon. Maybe they're doing red

44:27.600 --> 44:33.120
so that you don't notice the rings. That's a joke, I think, that has to be made there.

44:33.120 --> 44:37.960
The rings blend in with it. Red seems like a really weird color for a video game system,

44:37.960 --> 44:43.720
though. Is it just me? Like, I get black, I get white, I get gray. I even get pink for

44:43.720 --> 44:49.120
the DS. I actually understand that. But red? It worked for the Virtual Boy. Oh, sorry.

44:49.120 --> 44:57.560
Oh no, it didn't. He saw nothing but red on the Virtual Boy. Yeah. I don't know. I mean,

44:57.560 --> 45:02.760
I could see them putting something like this out for a limited time or something. People

45:02.760 --> 45:09.600
might buy it. Even the Xbox being green? That made sense, actually. I have the Xbox that

45:09.600 --> 45:14.520
was green, the Halo one, not the regular black one. But yeah, I don't know. Red seems like

45:14.520 --> 45:18.320
a strange color, though. But okay. I mean, whatever. Maybe I'm just saying that because

45:18.320 --> 45:22.120
I know it would totally clash in my house, but why I'm so worried about it, I don't know.

45:22.120 --> 45:29.680
I'm sure if this were to actually exist, that they're probably going to be making an announcement

45:29.680 --> 45:33.680
very soon on it since Resident Evil comes out in a few weeks. I mean, just assuming

45:33.680 --> 45:36.480
that it's actually going to be coming out with Resident Evil. Not that I would know

45:36.480 --> 45:43.200
or anything, but I'm just saying. Hypothetically. That something like this would be coming out

45:43.200 --> 45:47.800
with Resident Evil, we'd have to know about it very soon since, you know, that's only

45:47.800 --> 45:53.440
a few weeks away. Hypothetically speaking. Hypothetically. Well, something you are not

45:53.440 --> 45:58.480
allowed to know about, at least until very soon, that would be the evening of February

45:58.480 --> 46:05.600
23rd over in Japan, which would be, no, that's going to be late, no, tomorrow morning, right?

46:05.600 --> 46:09.960
Well evening in Japan? Yeah, it's evening in Japan. They're on the other side of the

46:09.960 --> 46:14.440
date line, so maybe any minute now we're going to hear about this. There's going to be, yeah,

46:14.440 --> 46:17.880
no, it's morning over there right now, so probably in the overnight hours for us we'll

46:17.880 --> 46:25.320
hear coming out of Japan some new Capcom-based Xbox Live title. Or no, it might be just a

46:25.320 --> 46:29.520
360 title that they are announcing through Xbox Live. They're going to be releasing a

46:29.520 --> 46:36.360
trailer tomorrow. And here's my thought, wouldn't this just be Dead Rising 2? I mean, because

46:36.360 --> 46:39.640
we've kind of had the hype for it the past week and it's been confirmed, like, is it

46:39.640 --> 46:43.600
really that big of a secret? Or do we really think something new is going to come out of

46:43.600 --> 46:47.560
this? Because when I read this I was like, it's just going to be Dead Rising 2. Or it

46:47.560 --> 46:54.200
could be something lame like sheep. Was Capcom making the sheep game? Yeah, they're publishing

46:54.200 --> 47:01.300
it. They should do Black Sheep the game. Captain Commando HD Remix. They are 17 hours ahead,

47:01.300 --> 47:05.440
so they are about noon. It's about noon in Japan right now, so we'll see more in a little

47:05.440 --> 47:12.000
while. I for one support the Captain Commando HD Remix. You think? Dude, I dumped so many

47:12.000 --> 47:19.320
quarters in that game, it's not even funny. Maybe Mega Man 10. I somehow doubt it. How

47:19.320 --> 47:26.040
about Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Area 50, or no, no, what was that game? Oh, no, no, I'm sorry,

47:26.040 --> 47:34.800
take that back. UN Squadron on Xbox Live. That would be awesome. UN Squadron. Act F

47:34.800 --> 47:41.080
says Dark Stalkers for the love of God. Lioshin says Power Stone 3. I have to interject. I've

47:41.080 --> 47:46.280
gotten the best reaction out of Drew ever. What? I've shown him a copy of the Amazon

47:46.280 --> 47:50.920
page for the book I'm going to be ordering. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the classic

47:50.920 --> 47:56.040
Regency romance now with ultra-violent zombie mayhem. That would kind of tie into the whole

47:56.040 --> 48:00.560
Dead Rising thing. Yes. DJ Rama S in chat suggests Rival Schools 3 could be the mystery

48:00.560 --> 48:08.920
game. Yes, I know, I wish. Damn you, Capcom. Dream on, I hate to say it. We'll see. Alright,

48:08.920 --> 48:11.680
let's travel the world and look at some release dates that we actually know about. Or another

48:11.680 --> 48:16.320
Monster Hunter game, because they like making Monster Hunter. That would make sense for

48:16.320 --> 48:23.160
Japan too. They didn't advertise that the trailer was going to be here, right? I don't

48:23.160 --> 48:25.800
know, we'll see. Alright, let's travel the world and look at some of the release dates

48:25.800 --> 48:31.020
that we know about. We'll start off in Europe, Dark Sakura. Well, coming out for the gaming

48:31.020 --> 48:37.280
systems and PCs and stuff in Europe, on the 27th, we have Castlevania Judgment on Wii,

48:37.280 --> 48:44.080
Cryostasis for PC, Dead Rising and Chop Till You Drop on Wii, Family Ski and Snowboard

48:44.080 --> 48:51.440
on Wii, Halo Wars for Xbox 360, Killzone 2 for Playstation 3, Men of War on PC, Necro

48:51.440 --> 49:00.720
Vision on PC, Onechambara, Bikini Samurai Squad, and Bikini Zombie Slayers, First for

49:00.720 --> 49:08.240
the 360, Second for Wii, Silent Hill Homecoming on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC, and Ultimate

49:08.240 --> 49:16.560
Band on DS and Wii. The end. You know, it's funny that you mention, that I was talking,

49:16.560 --> 49:21.340
we were talking about Capcom in an announcement and stuff like that, because on Kotaku here,

49:21.340 --> 49:28.360
they have listed Flock as coming out next week on Xbox Live Arcade. Remember Flock was

49:28.360 --> 49:34.960
the sheep one by Capcom. Boring! I don't think that's that, but you never know. Anyways,

49:34.960 --> 49:38.320
next week's actually pretty exciting for game releases. There's some pretty good stuff coming

49:38.320 --> 49:44.080
out, including Star Ocean Last Hope on Xbox 360, which should be pretty epic. Pretty good

49:44.080 --> 49:52.200
reviews so far. 50 Cent, Blood on the Sand on PS3 and Xbox 360. Hell yes! Shell Shock

49:52.200 --> 50:03.240
2, Blood Trails on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC. Legacy of Ys, Book 1 and 2 on DS. Yay! Nice! Puzzle

50:03.240 --> 50:13.200
Quest Galactrix on DS. Cool. Dead Rising Chop Till You Drop on the Wii. Stoked on Xbox 360,

50:13.200 --> 50:21.200
it's a pretty fun snowboarding game. Imagine Ice Champions on DS. Supposedly, Eat Lead

50:21.200 --> 50:25.440
the Return of Matt Hazard. I hope that comes out that week, because I thought it was the

50:25.440 --> 50:40.160
week after, but you never know. Let's see, Killzone 2 on PS3. Pagle on DS. My Personal

50:40.160 --> 50:49.440
Diary on DS. And Puzzle Challenges and More on Wii. Unfolded Raptor in chat says, Blood

50:49.440 --> 50:53.800
on the Sand is going to be game of the year, just watch. Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, live

50:53.800 --> 50:58.960
on Sunday nights. I'm tempted to buy it, just to see. There's a part of me that wants to

50:58.960 --> 51:02.800
buy it, but it's probably going to be 60 bucks, right? There's going to be 60 bucks, don't

51:02.800 --> 51:06.840
buy it. I'll wait for it to hit the bargain bin. Dude, do you know what I saw at Best

51:06.840 --> 51:12.880
Buy the other day? A Rock Revolution bundle for 30 bucks. That's drums and game. Yeah,

51:12.880 --> 51:18.800
I think that's just slightly under what they normally cost now. I mean, it's that bad.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.120
I thought about it, because you can use the drums with other games, right? Yeah, but they

51:22.120 --> 51:28.480
suck that bad. But I mean, hey, if you want, get the game for the download content, because

51:28.480 --> 51:33.880
they have some of the guitar freak stuff in there. Ah, that's a good reason. Think about

51:33.880 --> 51:41.360
it. Yeah, I don't know. So that, I think that's pretty much it for this week. Alright, let's

51:41.360 --> 51:45.320
look at the Japanese release dates then. Also, a pretty big week in Japan. They've got some

51:45.320 --> 51:50.100
busy, busy stuff going on over in Japan. On the 26th of February, you have Battlefield

51:50.100 --> 51:55.200
Bad Company getting a price reduction. Chaos Head Noah is a new game coming out over in

51:55.200 --> 51:59.600
Japan. Halo 3 also gets a price reduction. That's because Halo Wars is slated to come

51:59.600 --> 52:06.040
out on February 26th over there in Japan. Busy, busy week. Samurai Doh 3 comes out as

52:06.040 --> 52:10.200
well, and Rainbow Six Vegas 2 also gets a price reduction, so it's a good week for some

52:10.200 --> 52:15.880
sales over there in Japan. Moving on to the Playstation 3, NBA Live gets a price reduction.

52:15.880 --> 52:22.960
Otherwise, as far as a new game goes, Ryu Ga Gotoku comes out, number 3 in the series.

52:22.960 --> 52:31.600
I'm not sure what this is. It's the Yakuza 3. It's just Yakuza 3? Yeah. Oh, okay. Looks

52:31.600 --> 52:38.720
like you can get some romance on in this one. Yes, they have chicks you can pick up. Nice.

52:38.720 --> 52:43.920
Tom Clancy's End War also coming out on Playstation 3. Again, these are Japanese release dates.

52:43.920 --> 52:47.480
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, it's actually kind of a slow week for once in Japan on the

52:47.480 --> 52:52.920
Wii. High School Musical 3, senior year. Medal of Honor Heroes 2 gets a price reduction.

52:52.920 --> 53:00.920
As far as the new game goes, One Piece Unlimited Cruise, Episode 2, Mesamiro Yuusha comes out.

53:00.920 --> 53:04.800
Let's see, apparently there was already an Episode 1 that came out, and you can actually

53:04.800 --> 53:10.320
use your save file from Episode 1 to continue on with your quest in this game. So it's an

53:10.320 --> 53:15.520
action game that's kind of comical. Based off the One Piece anime series with stretchy

53:15.520 --> 53:24.600
pirates. Really? Nice. Playstation 2, you have the King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match

53:24.600 --> 53:31.000
coming out in Japan. I know there's some King of Fighter fans in the house. And on the Nintendo

53:31.000 --> 53:39.480
DS, kind of a range of games. Dragon Dance, Game Center CX, Arena no Chosenju comes out

53:39.480 --> 53:49.040
as well. A Voice Chat DS application comes out as well. As Kameko Deluxe DS Yomei Tomika

53:49.040 --> 53:57.120
To Otoko Tohona comes out. And that is, looks like a little girly adventure game, but there's

53:57.120 --> 54:02.080
bowling in it. I don't know if it's like a minigame collection or what, but there's like

54:02.080 --> 54:06.520
a little bowling minigame in that. Probably not something we're going to get over here.

54:06.520 --> 54:11.320
And lastly, on the PSP, again in Japan, because sometimes they get stuff before we do, you

54:11.320 --> 54:19.860
get a port of Dragon Dance, and Kamen no Maid Guy Boyouyan Battle Royale comes out. It's

54:19.860 --> 54:23.880
an adventure game, not to be confused with the Battle Royale movie that we all know and

54:23.880 --> 54:28.160
love. But it does have girls in school girl outfits, and it looks like they're fighting

54:28.160 --> 54:34.600
each other. Based off the manga series. Is it? And they attack each other with brooms.

54:34.600 --> 54:37.800
Is this like maids fighting each other? That's what it looks like. I don't know what it is.

54:37.800 --> 54:44.880
Yeah, it's in the title. Kamen no Maid. Maid games are like, anything maids are like, major

54:44.880 --> 54:51.640
major big fetish deals. Well, there you have it. So you fetish fans, get that on PSP. Also,

54:51.640 --> 54:58.600
your memories off, girls style. At least I wasn't called your panties off. Wow, that's

54:58.600 --> 55:02.560
an adventure game. Because if it was, that would be an instant purchase. You might want

55:02.560 --> 55:08.360
to go women's style, not girls style for that. And then lastly, Shin Sangoku Musou Multi-Raid

55:08.360 --> 55:17.520
comes out on the PSP. That's an action game that looks like, looks a little Final Fantasy-ish,

55:17.520 --> 55:21.720
but with some live action elements in it, it looks like. So check that out on PSP. If

55:21.720 --> 55:25.440
you're in Japan. There you have it. That does it for your PSP. Or if you want to get it

55:25.440 --> 55:31.400
for your friends in America, who do a show for you every Sunday. And DJ Rama S in chat

55:31.400 --> 55:39.160
room says, yes, maid games do sell. I know I sell a lot of hentai maid games. Congratulations.

55:39.160 --> 55:46.040
Well how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with maids? Yes, please. Bobsleds!

55:46.040 --> 55:52.760
Have a maid in a bobsled. You know there is someone out there who has a fetish for maids

55:52.760 --> 55:59.840
on bobsleds. But no. If so, this show's for you. This is high speed bobsled racing from

55:59.840 --> 56:07.140
Sega. God, Sega, why do you do this to me? It's called Storm G and it's a deluxe cabinet

56:07.140 --> 56:14.840
set where they've got them all lined up. And it's supposed to have you bobsledding and

56:14.840 --> 56:26.120
rocket powered blobs- blobs- bobsleds. Boobsledding? Okay. Each sled though- That would be cold!

56:26.120 --> 56:34.060
Too cold! Each sled though accommodates two people and it has twin joysticks and each

56:34.060 --> 56:40.800
person controls different aspects of- Boobs and twin joysticks. Bob! Each joystick controls

56:40.800 --> 56:48.760
different aspects of it to do 360 degree rotation and increase your speed. I think the maid

56:48.760 --> 56:54.680
fans would like this game. It sounds pretty hot. At any rate, it's like a 10 minute game

56:54.680 --> 57:04.080
and you pay about 650 to play at 600 yen. And it's already at the Joyopolis in March.

57:04.080 --> 57:09.160
For any of our Japanese listeners, go there and take pictures of it and get signs of it

57:09.160 --> 57:14.040
in play. Really, really want to see what it's like. Have fun bobsledding with your twin

57:14.040 --> 57:24.120
joysticks at Joyopolis. Don't forget to send us your postcards. Well, if rocket bobsledding

57:24.120 --> 57:31.080
isn't for you, there are some other games coming out as well that are equally epic,

57:31.080 --> 57:38.840
including the brand new game running on Sega's new hardware, Ring Edge, and the game's called

57:38.840 --> 57:44.640
Border Break. You may remember it as, well it's sort of like Virtual On actually, but

57:44.640 --> 57:50.980
played a little bit more linear, kind of like Armored Core. So it's a mech action fighting

57:50.980 --> 57:58.080
game, which looks pretty awesome. And unfortunately it probably won't be coming to the US, but

57:58.080 --> 58:03.240
it will be in Japanese arcades beginning February 23rd. In other words, next week. So, looks

58:03.240 --> 58:08.040
pretty awesome. You know, I'm looking at this next story and I'm thinking, you know what?

58:08.040 --> 58:11.640
I think this will be great for Jamie's birthday. Jamie, what do you say? How about for your

58:11.640 --> 58:17.960
birthday, I buy you four Sega arcade cabinets for your house. I'm going to buy you Outrun,

58:17.960 --> 58:23.360
Hang On, Space Harrier, and Thunder Blade. Don't you want that in your house? Got two

58:23.360 --> 58:30.400
out of four, right? Well, there is a little twist to this because I don't actually, I'm

58:30.400 --> 58:37.760
not pooping money. I actually would be buying these new toys that are coming out. It's coming

58:37.760 --> 58:43.880
out from, I'm not, Organic is the name of the toy maker. They are taking classic Sega

58:43.880 --> 58:50.560
arcade cabinets and shrinking them down to like four inches in length. And those are

58:50.560 --> 58:54.000
the four cabinets they're going to be releasing as these little figurine toys. These are like

58:54.000 --> 59:01.200
little gachapon, basically. Yeah. But the capsule game stuff. Well, no, they're actual,

59:01.200 --> 59:05.000
the actual arcade cabinet. Like they're toys that look like the little cabinets, but I

59:05.000 --> 59:10.400
was saying they're little capsule toys. You buy the box and you get a random one out of

59:10.400 --> 59:15.440
each box. Probably. It doesn't say if they're actual capsule toys or what the thing is going

59:15.440 --> 59:21.480
on, but I don't think they're playable. That's for sure. But this little thing, those are

59:21.480 --> 59:28.160
very, very, very popular. I mean, getting all the various character and goods that come

59:28.160 --> 59:33.800
up. Capcom's actually got a series of little figures for some of the female characters.

59:33.800 --> 59:38.120
By the way, there is a fifth cabinet. That's a secret. According to the website, secret

59:38.120 --> 59:46.560
my ass. You know what that is? I think is, um, a, uh, well, no, it can't be a, it can't

59:46.560 --> 59:50.800
be an afterburner because afterburner is a closed machine. Oh yeah. Cause it went a little

59:50.800 --> 59:55.640
high. Oh, well actually no, I think, I think it might be an afterburner if they had like

59:55.640 --> 01:00:00.620
the cover off of it. Maybe it's a houses of the dead. No, no, no. I don't think you sat

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:05.480
down with that one. Well, these are all classic cabinets. So it can't be, it can't be the

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:10.400
very much space area. Well, no, you know what, honestly, I think it, I think it is an afterburner

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:16.640
because, um, space Harrier, if I'm right, um, had the closed top too. And this figure

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.080
doesn't, yeah, it just kind of makes sense to with the other games it would fit in. Yeah,

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:26.520
we'll see. We'll probably see when these things come out. It's one of the Sega 360 machines.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.040
Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't know about some of these, uh, acidic vampire says WTF. I can't

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:37.560
play it. If it's four inches, a game guru says next up a miniature mega drive. Who knows?

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:42.000
I think they have those. It's possible. They do it like, especially another, I hear like

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.720
in some other countries like in South American stuff, those, um, uh, little Genesis collections

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.840
that are in the controllers and stuff are very popular. So, of course I could be full

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.280
of crap too. It wouldn't be the first time. We'll see. But let's do some, those are just

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.480
a little gotcha poem. Other news. Well, in other news, we have some news about the Metal

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:10.600
Gear movie and you know how pissed off I was. They were taking my man off of it. Well, guess

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:16.000
what? And your man is? David Hader. He's back on. Well, he didn't come right out and say

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.200
it, but he danced around saying everything, but yes, I'm back. So, um, at an interview

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.520
and actually, um, there, I'm going to go ahead and actually post a link up to the article,

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.880
um, because there's a copy of the interview, um, on there. Um, it's on Kotaku, but, um,

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:38.480
in an interview, he was basically saying that there's a possibility of involvement in being

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.560
back on it instead of just saying no. So I'll be posting that in the chat room so everyone

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.000
can watch the interview. It's cool. It makes me happy. Very cool. I know you love David

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.880
Hader. Oh, hell yeah. I mean, he gave us the first X-Men movie and he's the voice of Solid

01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:00.080
Snake, so it makes sense. He should just play Snake. Well, another movie that may have been

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:06.360
at one time, but I don't think it's coming out anytime soon, if at all. Um, Mega Man,

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:13.000
the movie, apparently Warner Brothers at one time, um, was trying to acquire the rights

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.840
for the Mega Man series to, um, turn it into a feature film. God, no, please don't. You

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.720
know this would be terrible. It would be, it would be absolute shit if they were to

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:27.000
do this as a movie. Unless it was, like, animated. You could not do a live-action Mega Man movie.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.320
I'm sorry. Uh, yeah. Capcom, the creators, are, um, wary, letting anyone touch the project

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:38.040
after a few disastrous licensing moves with the property, as well as the recent so-so

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:45.640
reaction to other movie adaptions. The most recent movie made that the suits, um, asked

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.160
Capcom for, or, the most recent move made was that the suits asked Capcom for a wishlist

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:57.400
of directors, and Shyamalan, that's right, as in M. Night Shyamalan, was one of the names

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:04.200
they came back with. You know, here's the thing. M. Night Shyamalan movies have gotten

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.560
progressively worse, too. Yeah, but here's the thing, though. He's trying to break out

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:12.280
from doing- I did like the village. Well, okay, okay, enough of the actual M. Night

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.480
Shyamalan movies that he writes and stuff like that. He's actually trying to break out

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.280
from doing those types of movies, and that's why he's doing the live-action Avatar movie,

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.760
which is, you know, based off the Nickelodeon animated series. So, if that turns out okay,

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:33.480
then maybe he can direct other things that don't have twists in them, you know? So, I

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:39.560
don't know. It's- they shouldn't touch it. But, you know what, though, nowadays with

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.680
technology becoming better and better, I mean, they could do something pretty cool with it,

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:50.760
but it's just- it's so hard to do something like that. Gameguru in chat says, Avatar the

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.720
movie will flop. Well, we'll see. You don't know. There might be a lot of kids that wanna

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:59.360
go see that. I don't know. Well, we have one more story before we get to the classic game

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.080
of the week and start to close out part A here tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, and that

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.880
is about a very interesting ROM hack. I mean, some people have got a lot of frickin' time

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:14.220
on their hands. Some Japanese ROM hack folks have taken a Final Fantasy II ROM and basically

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:19.560
converted it to Final Fantasy X. Now, granted, a lot of it is still, like, you know, just

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.920
basically palette-swapping, but they've actually been able to insert some cutscenes into it

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:30.600
that fit with the Final Fantasy X story. The water scene between Tidus and Yuna is in there,

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.560
which is kind of interesting. And look at that title screen just alone. It's like, oh

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.240
my gosh, I can't believe they actually worked that into an 8-bit cartridge. So, yeah, some

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:44.320
folks- That's very impressive. Yeah, but seriously, you got a lot of time on your hands if you're

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.000
doing that kind of detail. Well, seriously, I'm actually gonna play through this. Totally.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.560
Looks better than that Chinese Final Fantasy VII that was out a little while ago. Yeah,

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.080
it does look a lot better than the Final Fantasy VII, I'll give you that. Looks a lot better

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.960
than that. Yeah, and GameGuru says, wasn't there a Final Fantasy VII NES ROM hack? Yes,

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:08.960
there was. So, there you go. Alright, so let's move into the classic video game of the week.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.480
You know, every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, we tell you guys, go into your classic

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.840
archives, and find an old game to pay some respect to. And Dark Sakura digs through her

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:25.640
own huge archive of games. You told me how many systems, you and Dan counted, right?

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:31.160
I think we came up to 30 to 32, something like that. Systems? Yeah. That's crazy. So,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:38.280
you've dug through all those archives- That's non-import, non-duplicate systems. Wow. That's

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:43.120
crazy. With the imports, we get up to 40. 40-ish. Oh my gosh. But you still don't have

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.560
a Pippin. What's up with that? Just kidding. Anyhow, let's go ahead and look at the classic

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.880
video game of the week, which if I'm not mistaken, is pretty topical this week. Right, Dark Sakura?

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:57.680
But before we say your name, you've got to play the music, because I know people are

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.360
going to get it right away. Okay, then let me fire up the music here. Here's a return

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:14.200
of video game music video. Okay, now we all get it, don't we? Oh, it's the Puzzle Fighter

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:22.280
theme. Bite my butt. The game is Street Fighter Alpha 2 or Street Fighter Zero 2, and I don't

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.840
mention the first one, because as awesome as the first one was, the second one was the

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:38.040
best. Oh, what? The first game is no longer canon. The second game replaced the first

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:46.520
game's storyline. Yeah, what he said. So, Street Fighter Alpha 2 basically was the game

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:52.400
that gave us the annoying things called alpha counters, which I actually kind of like, but

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.920
I hate doing them by accident. We have the three level super combo gauge, air blocking

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:05.880
and ball breaking, and thank god we didn't get parrying in that one like in Street Fighter

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:13.920
3, because parrying while cool was a pain in the ass. So basically it's, and I honestly

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.920
think this was pretty much the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series, because Alpha 3

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.360
was kind of ass, except for some of the characters in it, and I hated the A-ism, B-ism, I hated

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:31.800
picking all that shit. So, anyway, this also had Akuma as a regular character, or as he

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:35.680
was in the Japanese version, Goki, which I think is a better name, especially if you

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:41.760
consider the current storyline that it was Goki versus Goken. So anyway, so you actually

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.880
got Shin Akuma as your secret opponent. Everyone brought in the rival thing, which I was going

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:52.480
to say, I was really glad they put that in Street Fighter 4, the whole rival, where you

01:07:52.480 --> 01:08:00.480
have like your special opponent, who's your main nemesis or whatever. And then you also

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:09.560
have Instantly Selectable, you have Bison, who was Vega in the Japanese version, Akuma

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:18.680
and Dan. You also got three characters who were returning from other games. You got Zangief

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.440
and Zalcine, and then you got Gen, who was from the first Street Fighter game. You also

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:29.520
got Rolento from Final Fight, and Sakura, who was the first original new character for

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:33.680
that series, and I thought it was really cool. Well, even for the second one that came out,

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:40.200
for Alpha, too. Anyway, I was very happy, though, when they shared bringing in the Final

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.800
Fight characters, because I freaking loved Final Fight. I've been collecting everywhere

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:51.560
for Final Fight, except for the American-made crap versions. Didn't Dan count as an original

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:58.600
character as well? He was in the first game! Yep. On top of that, for anyone who doesn't

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:06.760
know, he's totally a parody of Art of Fighting, because Ryo and Robert Garcia were combined

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.920
to make Dan who was a big joke. However, if you can beat the game with him, mad props

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:20.320
to you. You can beat Puzzle Fighter with him, mad props to you. So... Juice has real men

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:29.000
played Dan. Anyway, so you've got all your characters, you have, you know, basically

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.400
different versions of them. You've got arcade versions on the consoles. Now, this is going

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:45.400
to be me bitching for just a moment. The Super NES... We did not play 2s. Well, the other

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:56.160
two ran out. I like Chun-Li. This is a game where I decided that Chun-Li is a bitch. Anyway,

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:05.040
there was a Super Nintendo version of this released in 96. I had this for a while before

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:12.640
it was removed from my possession without me knowing. Rawr. Die. It was the version

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:19.800
that made use of the SDD1 chip for graphic decompression. So guess what it put into a

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:29.600
cartridge game? Load time. It had, now loading, in a freaking SNES cartridge. It had to decompress

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:39.240
and load. And I'm like, damn. This is slow. There was also a PC version that was based

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:47.560
off the Playstation version. It was okay. I actually have that somewhere in my house.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:52.280
There was the home version that came out of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, which in Japan

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:58.860
came out of Street Fighter Zero 2 Dash. And it was also part of the Street Fighter collection

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:08.720
that was a big compilation. And then there was the, in the gold version it had Kami based

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:15.920
on her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance. And it was, she was actually a hidden character

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:24.440
that was selectable in the versus and training modes. So that was pretty cool. Also, on Playstation

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:32.160
2 we got Street Fighter Alpha Anthology, which is more like the arcade version of the game.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.760
It was pretty cool. There, I actually got both the Saturn and the Playstation versions.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:44.800
And the Saturn version, way better. Way better. It's far better than the Playstation version

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:50.040
was. Actually, anything 2D, practically, the Saturn version is going to be better. Better

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.800
colors, better, it can handle 2D graphics and sound so much better than the Playstation

01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:08.280
version. At any rate, they actually, in 1996, Dan won number one video game character and

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:13.920
Sakura won number three video game character, which I thought was funny, that was actually

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:20.920
in Gamest Magazine, which is a Japanese magazine. Got best fighting game, number nine best in

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:27.200
graphics, number six best direction, number four best video game music. So that's pretty

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.040
cool. And it seriously, oh, we got Rose's music. Rose is in Street Fighter IV, I thought

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:40.080
it was cool. But it's just a really, to me it is the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.840
I mean, I love Street Fighter IV, and actually I like Street Fighter III for just playing

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:51.880
as Ibuki. But other than that, I mean, Street Fighter II is like the top-under for me. It

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.520
does not get better than that.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.400
Alright, well there you have it. Your classic video game of the week, Street Fighter Alpha

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:03.200
2. A very good topical pick, considering the game that's on everybody's mind this week.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:08.060
We have to take a minute to respect the classics that help inspire some of the appearances

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:13.080
you see in Street Fighter IV, such as Rose and Sakura and Dan and so on. So, that's going

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.520
to do it for part A of our show, but don't go anywhere. Darn it, we got plenty more of

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:22.660
our show to come up. Part B, since Drew and Joe and everybody joined us late, I'll ask

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:26.360
them about their gaming weeks at the start of part B. And then we have some stuff to

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.920
get into as well. We're going to talk about the DSi, finally got a release date in North

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.280
America, confirming some earlier rumors that were floating around out there.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280
That's so weird.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.200
That's so weird how that happens. We're going to talk about some video game law here in

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:43.700
California and some other Wii rumors. So, don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:52.080
more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:56.880
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Here on this lovely Sunday evening, February

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:02.040
the 22nd of 2009, and we're watching Loki playing Noby Noby Boy on Justin TV and just

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.240
giggling at the little farting noises it's making.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:10.080
The secret word, Rob, is parakeet.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.520
There's definitely a little parakeet sitting there in the bottom corner or what have you.

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.560
So, alright, Loki's going to switch it off and get it switched back over to our camera

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.680
feed in studio. And we're going to get back into some gaming news.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.680
Space squirrel in the corner.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.360
Alright, we're going to get back into some gaming news in just a minute, but first I

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.480
thought we would start since Loki needs a minute to get things switched back anyway.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.000
Talk about our gaming weeks a little bit. Drew, since you guys came a little late, how

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.460
was your gaming week? What kind of games have you been playing lately?

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:44.680
Pretty good. Kim came to visit, so brought over the PS2, played some Karaoke Revolution,

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:53.240
some Guitar Hero, King of Fighters 06, and surprisingly a little bit of the original

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.520
Naruto Ultimate Ninja. I don't know why we were playing it, but we were playing it.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:03.800
I wanted to because I was bored. You asked for it. You're the one who suggested

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.080
it, not me. I just so happened to bring it with me.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:13.080
I've been too tired to remember what I've been playing.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.960
Alright, that's alright, that's alright. Kim doesn't want to go. You sound kind of

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.600
sick, are you alright? Um, yeah, it's just a cold, I think, in the

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.120
back. Yeah, I had that a week ago, it sucks.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.400
Alright, uh, Joe is behind you. What have you been playing lately, Joe?

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.480
Also known as Dark Tetsuya from our website. I actually picked up Need for Speed Underground.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:36.480
Oh, how's that? It's kind of cool. I want to get the second

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.680
one. How is it different from other Need for Speed

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.640
games? I don't know, there's a lot of emphasis on

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:46.520
tuning your car. Making it look cool. So it's like Pimp My Ride?

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:53.160
Pretty much. Only more fun. Alright, we gotcha. Alright, cool, cool.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.520
Well, um, it looks like Loki's got everything switched back on Justin.TV from our, uh, from

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.680
our bra- uh oh, what happened? Did we not get any audio over there?

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:08.560
Uh oh. We'll see what happens. There might be some feedback. Live radio, of course we

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:17.060
do tape live on Sunday nights at AllGames.com. They don't see video, just audio for some

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:20.760
reason on Justin.TV, but again, Justin.TV is not the top priority. We are trying to

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.560
do a radio show, so we'll figure it out one way or another, I guess.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:31.120
Uh, anyhow, um, I want to get back into gaming news, but we need Loki to start us off. That's

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.560
alright, just don't worry about it for a minute. Just let it- they can deal.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.440
Chatham always goes up in arms when Justin.TV goes down. I'm like, it's a radio show!

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.440
It's working! You don't need Justin.TV. Alright.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.440
It's working now, it wasn't plugged in all the way or something.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:47.760
Alright, fair enough. Alright. Anyways, so, um, the Nintendo DSI was announced this week

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:54.440
that it would be coming out in the US, um, in the rest of North America on April 5th,

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:59.960
which is pretty close to estimates made by certain media outlets, but, um, it will be

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:06.720
coming out in the, um, North American region in two different colors, both black and kind

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:18.720
of a light blue, and will be retailing for $169.99. Neat, I guess. Um, yeah, I don't

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:25.120
know. Um, I'm not probably gonna pick one up myself, but, um, I don't know, they're

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.840
kinda cool, I guess. What's also neat, though, um, they're gonna be still supporting the

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.540
regular DS, of course, with the four colors that they have available, and, uh, no word

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:41.680
on when there's actually gonna be some DSI exclusive, um, cartridges, because right now

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:47.640
the only kind of exclusive stuff for the DSI is the stuff in the DSIware store, so.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.840
You know, I was reading some interesting stories on the internet this week about prototypes

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.160
for the DSI and how at one point they wanted it to have, like, two DS card slots, but I

01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.560
don't, I never really understood why. I don't get that either. By the way, that blue DS

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:05.480
is butt ugly. Well, maybe, maybe they were thinking that they could do, like, say, for

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.160
example, multi-cart games or something like that, because the storage on the DS cartridges

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.480
is pretty small, maybe have, like, half a game on one cartridge, half on another cartridge,

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:21.440
and you plug them both in, and then you don't have to, you know, swap cartridges, I guess.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.640
The problem with the blue DSI for me, and we have actdeft in chat, says, I like the

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.120
blue DSI. The problem with the blue DSI for me, it's one of my high school's colors. My

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.280
old high school, that was actually one of their colors, that gross light blue type color.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:37.760
Black. Not my favorite. Alright, well, also coming out on April 5th, a game that I'm sure

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.200
a lot of our long-time listeners who are into music games, since that's what we started

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:48.600
on, would be interested in. Rhythm Heaven, also known as, of course, Rhythm Tengoku overseas.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:53.480
Rhythm Heaven is going to be coming out on April 5th, as well as the DSI systems. Just

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:57.320
so you know, this game was made by the same people that made WarioWare, and it's kind

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.680
of like, it's something like that, but it's more with music. It's really hard to explain

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.920
this game. I played it at PAX, so this game has kind of been ready a little while, but

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.920
it's kind of some cool little musical mini-games. So, I think there'll be a lot of folks that

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.880
enjoy that, and I love this little alien character in the game, too, and I've seen that on people's

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.400
live journal icons and stuff, so there you go. So that is coming out as well on April

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:28.720
5th, and I'm sure there'll be plenty of folks getting copies of that. Well, there's actually

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:35.120
supposed to be more games coming out there saying that they're working on an adaptation

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:44.400
of Katamari Damacy and Mr. Driller for the DSiWare, according to Famitsu, anyway. There's

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:51.480
also going to be a Wii game of Mr. Driller, Mr. Driller World, that has a DS version that's

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:58.320
supposed to be called- oh my god, how am I going to pronounce this? Okay, I'm gonna try.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:05.320
I butcher names all the time in the Japanese release dates. This is long. Alright. Sekuto

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:13.180
Hamureru Hori Hori Action, which will have 17 levels, to be out in Japan next week. Alpha

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:21.320
Kananagram in chat says, that Katamari game is just a re-skinned pack attack. Cheap. Cheap.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:25.680
Not surprising. You know, they better make these releases good, or people are gonna say

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:30.800
all these DSi things are cheap. I don't know. Well, I can imagine that most of them will

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:38.580
be cheap. But, oh well. Now, if you happen to be living in Europe, you're in luck. You

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:44.960
get the DSi a couple days early. It will be releasing there on April 3rd. However, no

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:50.720
price has been announced yet. In Europe, luckily, will not be getting Ugly Blue, but they will

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:59.000
be getting White and Black. So, I don't know why, for whatever reason, I guess us Americans

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:08.920
can't handle White. It's gotta be Blue. Interesting. Interesting as well that Europe usually gets

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:16.240
screwed by Nintendo on release dates, but now it's actually gonna beat the US by a couple

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:21.360
days. Just a couple days. They'll probably get screwed on price still, but a couple days.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:27.840
So I guess only a couple reasons to bitch, I don't know. Anyhow, some big news coming

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.800
out of California this week. We live in a very interesting state, obviously. We broadcast

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.800
out of California and all of the people you see on the show are California residents.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.860
We've had this whole budget crisis going on where none of us have been getting state tax

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:43.240
returns because they don't have the money, basically. They finally signed a budget middle

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.780
last week after, what, like 106, 109 days? Something crazy. Well, maybe they didn't pass

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:53.960
the budget on time because they were too busy dealing with video game laws. And guess what?

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:58.560
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals came down this week and said that the California game

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:06.280
law has been stricken. Basically, they came out and placed a permanent injunction on it

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:13.880
and it's no longer there. The ESA president, Michael Gallagher, says this is a win, saying

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:19.400
it sends a clear signal at these types of reckless legislations. It's wasting taxpayers'

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:24.380
money, government time, and state resources. Of course, Leland Yee, who has been heavily

01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:30.320
involved in this bill and everything, is pushing for California to appeal the ruling to the

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.960
Supreme Court. By the way, I believe as a part of this, we will have to pay the ESA

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.720
fees for this, just like another state had to do not that long ago. I remember we covered

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:47.280
on the show. What a great thing for a broke state to be doing. Maybe you guys should just

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.000
give up on that whole thing. So whenever we talk about these video game laws and them

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.840
trying to censor video games and all this stuff, we get angsty. And when we get angsty,

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:19.120
FUs of the week happen. Believe it or not, I don't have any FUs. No, I take that back

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:24.800
all day. FUs are people who don't know how to grow the fuck up. And before anyone says

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.600
anything, it's not who people may think I'm talking about. I knew you were talking about

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:35.640
me. I knew it. Bitch. Well, you know what? I'm going to cut you. No, shoot. Okay, I'm

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.220
not going to go into detail, but I have... Okay, I'll go into a little detail. I have

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:49.080
a friend who, as long as I have known this person, basically gives off the impression

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:55.200
of being very generous and very open to people, but really it's all very self-serving. You

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.800
know what I mean? It's like, for anyone who is a philosophy nut like me, it's pretty much

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.600
like how Hobbes said people were, that you only do good deeds because it makes you feel

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.760
good. This is what I've come to realize about this particular person, so FU to that. Grow

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:17.520
the fuck up. I'm not going to deal with it anymore. Alrighty, Loki. FU for the second

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.840
week in a row to the weather for ruining yet another airsoft outing. I was supposed to

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:28.400
be going on Sunday today, this morning, however it is raining and will continue the rain until

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:35.880
next Sunday. It's so retarded. It was clear all week long and then fucking rained on Sunday,

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:43.480
the day that I'm going. So fuck you mother nature, fuck you right up your ass. Is it

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.440
possible to fuck mother nature in her ass? I don't know about that. I'm going to say

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:54.800
an FU to the fact that I'm kind of hungry and so I'm going to eat something soon. FU

01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:07.360
to hunger pains. Drew, you got any FUs? Yeah. First off, FU to shitty service at the Ardent

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:17.520
Air Mall today. Okay, 20 minutes to prepare a meal at the Hibachi. What the fuck? I order

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.960
somehow there's a line formed. Oh, let's not go to Panda Express. Look, let's go to the

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:28.920
Hibachi-san. Let's go to Hibachi-san, I said. There's no line, I said. Oh no. On top of

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:34.120
everything else, we try to get portraits taken and that shit takes an hour and a half, causing

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:40.720
us to be late for the show. I'm not too pleased. Also, fuck you to the weather, fuck it in

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:47.920
its fucking ear. I'm sick and tired of it. It's sunny and then suddenly it rains. Way

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:55.280
to end the week on a good note. Kim, did you have anything? FU to being sick. I hate being

01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:01.640
sick on vacation. Sucks. Being sick does suck. All right. And Joe, do you have anything for

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:11.640
our listeners for Angst? Yeah, fuck being hungry. Fuck being hungry. All right. Anyhow,

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:17.960
let's get back into some gaming news. Dark Sakura. That was a very interesting way that

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:28.880
you just said my name. Dark Sakura. Okay. So Disney. Okay. Disney is bringing Spectrobes

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:37.880
Origins to Wii, supposed to be coming out in the fall. It's motion sensing, you know,

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:43.640
large real time battle thing, full 3D RPG world, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:52.000
So there are the two DS versions. Spectrobes and Spectrobes Beyond the Portals are already

01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:03.240
everywhere. So it's more Spectrobes. Yay. The end. Yay, the end. It's supposed to be

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:08.000
pretty good. I don't know. I mean, it's not a game I'm remotely interested in, but from

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.680
what I hear, it's supposed to be pretty good. It's been popular, I guess. Is it maybe just

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.400
for a particular audience? Um, yeah. Well, what they're doing now, they're actually launching,

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.840
I think, a cartoon as well, which will help because it's kind of like Pokemon. I mean,

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:28.960
the very Pokemon Digimon-esque, so I don't know. Really not for my age group at all.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.280
Wait, refresh my memory. Spectrobes, wasn't that gimmicky bullshit game where you had

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:38.180
to yell at the things to turn them into little monsters? I don't remember that, but it was

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:43.040
the one that had the special cards that you place over the DS touch screen where you tap

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:49.680
the spots and it will unlock different things. Oh. Yeah. So anyways, it's supposed to be

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.280
pretty decent. At least they're trying to be innovative with it. And, you know, maybe

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:58.720
they'll bring their D-gamer service over onto the Wii. That'd be pretty sweet, but I doubt

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:05.160
it. Doubt it a lot. Anyways, if you're not interested, though, in Spectrobes, there are

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:11.200
some rumors of other games that are coming out that might be worth it. Brutal Legends

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.900
is rumored to possibly be coming out to the Wii, and that's interesting. There's some

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:22.320
other stuff. Apparently, this is all from EA and Activision's 2009 lineup. Activision's

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:28.520
DJ Hero is tentatively scheduled for July. It seems like a weird time to put that out

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:35.320
if that were actually the case. Apparently, DJ Hero will feature a three- the peripheral

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.880
will feature three color buttons, a turntable, and a fader. Wow, if that's the case, they're

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:47.280
in for a lawsuit. This second Lego Indiana Jones game will be out, apparently, before

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.840
Christmas. I can see that. Activision will release a new Guitar Hero song pack around

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:58.920
the holiday season that kind of goes in line with- I think there was a Guitar Hero, like,

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:02.080
greatest hits or something like that they're planning on putting out, so that might make

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:08.240
sense. Star Wars Battlefront III is still alive, but probably won't be out until 2010.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:15.760
Well, of course that makes sense, because even though- was it a pandemic? Who am I thinking

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:20.920
of? Ah, whatever. Still, a game like that, very epic. Of course they're going to make

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:26.640
another one. Those are all rumors right now. Rumors. Things that we might see a little

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:36.560
more of at E3. Yeah, well, going to the DJ Hero thing, you know, I've seen prototypes

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:43.560
of the other DJ game coming out, and if that's the case, if it's got a crossfader and stuff,

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.160
that makes me kind of wonder if it's, you know, there might be a lawsuit because their

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:53.800
controller looks very similar. Hmm, we'll see what happens. Well, Lego! Gosh, those

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.800
Lego games, they sure know how to sell. The Lego Batman, the Lego Star Wars, Lego Indiana

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:05.080
Jones. Well, guess what's next? Lego Prince of Persia. That's coming out of the New York

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:09.600
Toy Fair that happened, yeah? Apparently, you know, since they are doing the movie,

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:12.040
they're doing the Prince of Persia movie, right? They're going to have some Lego figures

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:15.440
in place that's actually coming out for the game. Now, keep in mind, the toys are being

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:22.520
based off the movie, not the game. Keep this in mind, these are just toys for now, but

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:27.400
you never know. Could be a game later on. Lego Harry Potter's the next one, for sure.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:32.480
Well, other than Lego Battles, but in the Lego MMO. So, Lego Racers. No Lego Prince

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:36.680
of Persia game yet, but Lego Prince of Persia toys are definitely going to be happening.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:41.120
I could see the new Lego Harry Potter game. I could really see that too. It makes sense.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:50.400
The audiences kind of go hand in hand. So, crazy, I don't know, crazy fangirls for Legos

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:56.460
and Harry Potter. Anyhow, let's get into the mailbag. Every week we invite your emails

01:30:56.460 --> 01:31:01.640
at mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorites and reads

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:07.960
them here on the air for all of you guys to listen to us respond to. Veto. Or sometimes

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:16.240
Veto. Veto. Veto what? Veto this. Alright. Ooh, Rob. I mean, for great, me giving DarkSakura

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:21.240
the finger makes for great radio. Although Justin.tv can see it, so. Rob's a cheeky monkey.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:28.120
Cheeky monkey. Alright, mails. Well, one's kind of a plug. After you saw this email,

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:35.560
I'm going to go ahead and plug it. A plug? Alright. We hear from Redertainment. Well,

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:42.280
we got an ask to plug book. I think he friended me on Facebook, so therefore you can plug

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:49.280
away. Okay. The Hawk by Hunter Red, which you can download for free at Redertainment.com

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:54.280
starting on March 1st. So go read it. What is it? Oh, it's a book? A novel. Oh, okay.

01:31:54.280 --> 01:32:04.280
What a novel idea. Free distribution online. Make, you know, advocate literacy. Hey. So,

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:11.080
first actual email. I can see DarkSakura doing a PSA for reading. Read, goddammit! Read or

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:20.440
you're crap! Read something, you idiot! Illiteracy is stupid! Okay. Hi folks, just had a few

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:28.200
questions slash comments for tonight's show. Firstly, about the training cats for advertising,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:33.200
what if something goes wrong? What if there's a, wait for it, catastrophe? Sorry, I just

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:42.220
had to go for the pun. It was too good to pass up. P. Additionally, with regard to you

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:47.000
and your wind complaints tonight, it could be worse. At least you folks don't have planes

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.160
crashing in your area, just in case other listeners don't remember me mentioning it

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:55.200
before. I live in Buffalo, New York. Also- Actually, we do have planes crashing in our

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:59.880
area. There was one that crashed I think in Elk Grove or something? It was around here.

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.660
I didn't hear about that. The guy was doing, was it take off and touchdown landings and

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:09.240
one of those landings he forgot to lower the landing gear and caught the plane on fire.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.560
Don't! Oops. So no one got hurt. It was only one pilot. But still, it's a plane crash.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:22.520
No one got hurt. It counts. That's a crash due to stupid. Also, in case you haven't read,

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:26.120
seen, listened to the news for the past few days, there was a commercial plane crash,

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:30.240
blah blah blah. Also, Buffalo lost Thursday night. Specifically, in the suburb of Clarence,

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:35.720
at least you're just dealing with wind. Yeah, you've been negated. If I may, and if Dark

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:41.220
Sakura has time to read this, I'd just like to say, hi, in quotes, to the Dark Fury Link

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:47.480
show on the Alexander server in Final Fantasy XI, add it! And specifically to Jaden, Nagiko,

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:54.200
and Digby Reloaded. Now go play a real game. That was from Spazinator. I'm just kidding.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.680
I'm always so rude to my old game. Go play a real game, play Perfect World. I spent years

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.200
and years and years on Final Fantasy XI, just in case you guys don't know, so, you know.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:08.720
And City of Heroes, I'm sorry, is WoW without the suck. It's WoW with Barbie. It's WoW with

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:14.200
superheroes. It's WoW with Barbie mode. It's fun! Oh my god, making the superhero, and

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.840
you can save them. Just let me know when the Hello Kitty beta comes out. It's so great.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.160
I've made so many superhero costumes in the last week, because every time I would actually

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:31.640
try to log in and play the damn game, lose connection, log out. Fuck you. Don't. Anyway,

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:35.960
that's another story. Alright, was that it for mail? Last email. Oh no, one more, yay.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.360
But jeez, I could just not read it. Hey, when I went in there earlier, there was only like

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:45.360
two emails, so I'm happy to hear there's more emails. It's actually from the same guy. Oh.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.800
Because he sent the email late. Oh, there we go. I'll just read it anyway. Sure. Hi

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.680
folks, I just wanted to comment on a few things. Firstly, firstly is not a word, okay? Just

01:34:53.680 --> 01:35:02.400
say first, or first of all, or in the beginning, no. FYI, I sent you an email last week during

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:07.520
the month. I only should have one R in it, thank you. But apparently, I sent it too late.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:14.840
Not T-O-T-O-O, thank you. I'm sorry, you send late emails, you get graminated. Needless

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:19.920
to say, that it can be disregarded simply because I ended up calling in and repeated

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:27.160
what was in the email. Secondly, like, okay, Rob, your name is not Rob. I ended up getting

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:32.200
flowers too. Maybe he was drunk when he did the email. Maybe. I agree, it's a great game,

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.120
about flower. I agree, it's a great game, and very beautiful. Not only that, but it's

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.800
rather relaxing. I hate to call it a casual game, seeing as the term doesn't quite seem

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.640
to fit the game. Rather, I think calling flower a zen game seems to describe it a bit better.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.320
By the way, here's an easy way to get two trophies for it. Play a level as normal, go

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:55.000
do something for ten minutes between levels, and bam, one trophy unlocked. Another one

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.360
can be unlocked by simply backing out of the game, fast forward the system clock by a week,

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.720
and re-enter the game, then you'll get the second trophy. What do you think though about

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:08.560
the analogy that it's a racing game? Flower's just a big fruity racing game. Um, I'm sure

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:15.040
the email, if it could, you know, grow sentience and speak on its own on behalf of Spazinator,

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:21.640
it would probably tell you, boobs. On an unrelated note, Rob commented that $60 for a game is

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.140
kinda expensive, especially if you're only somewhat into a given series. Well, I would

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:32.600
just like to point out that with the previous gen systems in their games, when taking inflation

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:37.020
into consideration, the older games are just as expensive as current gen games, and in

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:41.000
some situations, even more expensive. Well, thank you for allowing me to throw in my two

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.920
cents. Inflation, dude, it should be two bucks, and better bring chocolate with that. This

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.400
email is sponsored by GTA IV, Lost in the Damned, and Oscar Meyer, home of the Never

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:57.240
Ending Supply of Wieners. Okay, and you know, I'm only nitpicking just to, you know, be

01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:06.880
a bitch, so. Alright. Hey, you heard it here first. I, like, apparently I like being a

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:13.040
rampaging bitch. Uh, let's see, bully maniacs in chat. Speaking of which, Sky, did you touch

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.360
on that last week? I didn't get home until way into the second part. Um, I don't remember.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:23.360
What was the email about? Something? Uh, oh, Flower? I don't know. No, I didn't play Flower

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.960
until this week, so I don't think I talked about it last week. No, I was reading the

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:34.720
comment in chat. Next week's show is on the server, I just need to push it to the podcast

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.600
feed. We do it a little differently now on the new website, and I kind of botched the

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.580
first one, I think, so I'm being a little careful before I do 3.13. But I am trying

01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:51.000
to get the podcast all caught up so people don't complain anymore. So, there we go. Alright,

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.080
let's move back into some gaming news. More emails, though. Mailbag, orangelaungeradio.com.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:07.760
Don't send them. Don't send them. Send them, please. Okay. I'm being silly. Yes, apparently,

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:13.080
once again, there's more rumors pointing to the next Tony Hawk game using a brand new

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:18.640
skateboarding controller. I'm sure we're gonna see this at E3. I mean, it only makes sense

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:26.160
that they're gonna pull this stuff out. Apparently, Variety is saying, you know, kind of confirming

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:33.000
this, saying their sources show a new controller along with some details. Apparently, it won't

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.760
be about precise balance. Instead, it will be about grabbing and manipulating the board

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:46.720
to pull all sorts of tricks from which Tony Hawk games are known for. Interesting. Something

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.960
tells me that there's... I don't know. Why can't we just have the Tony Hawk Pro Skater

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:58.160
stuff where it was fun? It was whimsical. You're pulling off tricks in like a mall or

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:02.040
something ridiculous. Or why can't we just fire Tony Hawk out of a cannon at this point?

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:06.360
I mean, I'm just kind of done. It's not Tony Hawk's fault, okay? We can't... This is just

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.440
like the same argument that our actor ruins a movie. No, that may be the case sometimes,

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:15.800
but it's not Tony Hawk's fault. It's Activision's fault. Fine. Why can't we fire Activision

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:22.800
out of a cannon? I don't know. None of cannons. Will it blend? Yes, it will blend. It will

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:29.160
blend because the blending blades are made of the hairs from Chuck Norris' legs. Great.

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:35.840
Baron's chat has leaked into Orange Lounge Radio. And you know that that's not true because

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:43.320
there's nothing that could cut a hair on Chuck Norris' leg. Die! But he can make them out

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:50.820
himself and market them. Good point. I did not think about that. Anyways, yes. This will

01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:58.920
be about as cool as that conversation right there. We'll have to see, I guess. But I don't

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.160
encourage any game being put out with some special controller because that just means

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.300
that they're going to be hard to find and expensive. Well, early in the show, Loki was

01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:10.680
talking about House of the Dead Overkill because I think that was coming out this week, right?

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.760
It came out a couple weeks ago. Just a couple weeks ago and it's something that Loki wants

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.880
to play or something. I just remembered the name came out for some reason. It came out

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.780
last week. Ah, whatever. Anyway, here's the thing. The developers behind this game, Headstrong

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:25.040
Games, they have made it publicly known that they are interested in revitalizing one of

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:31.160
Sega's classic franchises, Virtua Cop. And this was in an interview with Cube 3. This

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.440
is the producer, Neil McEwen. He said they would love to do Virtua Cop or another light

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:43.240
gun game for Sega. So, there you go. Apparently, the whole House of the Dead thing came to

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:47.940
be when they were meeting with Sega about possibly doing a game in one of their franchises.

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.200
And House of the Dead is what was settled on. However, if they continue, and you know

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:56.280
this game does well, and they decide they want to do another game, could Virtua Cop

01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.880
be a possibility? We'll see. I don't know how y'all feel about that, but it could be

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:10.000
interesting. So, we'll see. Do I gotta? Yeah, and Game Guru in chat says, uh, Sega, let

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.480
them do Virtua Cop. You know, Virtua Cop would actually be pretty fun. I had a lot of fun

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:24.000
playing it when it was new. Sorry. The whole Virtua series, they should just rename Virtua

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.120
Fighter to, oh look, another 3D fighter. Or Virtua Cop to, look, another gun game. Or

01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:36.320
something like that. Anyway. Well, there's something wonderful that came out to Club

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:42.580
Nintendo members in Japan. It was special. They could get a Wii controller that looked

01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:52.680
like an SNES pad, and now you can get one too for $75, courtesy of Playasia. But hey,

01:41:52.680 --> 01:42:02.360
it looks just like a real SNES pad. Even though it's really a Wii classic controller. Whatever

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:08.800
the fuck. You know, I'll probably get one. The real deal. Or I'll just probably break

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:17.640
out my paint. Ooh, it does look pretty cool though. I don't know, it's kind of expensive.

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:23.320
You know what, you could totally rewire, I bet you anything, because keep in mind the

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:28.360
classic controller actually is in the shape of the Super Famicom controller, which was

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:33.520
slightly different shape than our Super Nintendo controller as you'll recall, right? You can

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:40.920
though get Super Famicom controllers at like, eBay anywhere really, and probably just reshell

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:49.600
it, you know, it's not hard at all. I'd do it. I'm a cheap bitch. That is, I don't know,

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:53.760
I'm kind of over the whole Wii Virtual Console stuff until they put something really good

01:42:53.760 --> 01:43:01.460
on there, and yeah, so I'm just kind of, I don't really need this controller. We'll see.

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:05.600
I definitely don't need this controller, because I don't play Virtual Console games anymore.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:12.840
You don't. Yes. Which is too bad. But, there's some other retro games that might be interesting,

01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:18.920
including some fictional ones. D3, the publisher behind the new parody game, Eat, Lead, The

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:23.880
Return of Matt Hazard, is actually planning on releasing some of these retro parodies

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:28.840
on Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Network. It's supposed to be coming out this summer

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:35.000
at some point. No word on exactly what it is, but it'll probably be one of the in-joke

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
games that are going to be part of this game itself. I thought I heard a rumor that there

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.920
was going to be some of those games unlockable in, you know, Eat, Lead, so I don't really

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:49.320
know what they're going to be doing there, but I don't know. That'd be kind of neat if

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:56.520
they're good. But otherwise, you know, I think also it kind of, hopefully Eat, Lead does

01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:01.160
well because otherwise you're going to have some spinoff of a game that sucked. No one's

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.560
going to really want to play it. So, we'll see.

01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:07.640
I don't know much about this series, but I'm assuming this chat comment is in reference

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:11.080
to this. Game Guru says, Has Matt Karts will be interesting?

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:17.400
Yeah. Well, it's a fictional game series. Interesting. You know, speaking of like fictional

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.840
games and stuff, what is that retro game that came out on DS this week that sounds really

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:23.560
interesting, or last week I think it was? The Retro Game Collection or something like

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.120
that? Yeah, Retro Game Challenge, the Game Center

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:28.000
CX. That sounds kind of funny. I want to check

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.560
that game out. They have the sequel just came out in Japan

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:35.240
too, and it's actually one of the retro games, and it's actually like a 16-bit game now,

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:39.080
which is supposed to be a big deal. But it's interesting.

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:43.000
I like that they have like old magazines and stuff in there. Like, it's all made up.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.680
There's another one. I don't remember what it was called now, but it was that PSP game,

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:52.160
the one that you play 30 seconds at a time. I saw a video on that, and it looks awesome.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:56.200
It's so cheesy. I don't remember the name of it. We covered

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.320
it in a previous show. I remember talking about that though.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:04.960
Yeah, I think Yusha 30. Yeah, Yusha 30. It looks awesome, so I'm looking forward to checking

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.560
that out, but there's like, you know, you have to go to towns and stuff like that, and

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.300
you really have 30 seconds in between each thing, but you can get more time if you like

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:16.600
visit certain people and stuff. And AcidicVampire in Chat says, Retro Game

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:20.000
Challenge is really good. I just got it this past week. This is why I like having a live

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.260
chat room during the show. You know, not a lot of podcasts can do this. There's some

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:26.380
out there, you know, some of the others that are on all games, but not a lot of podcasts

01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:30.120
can do this, kind of interact and get answers live when we're stumped. Like, I don't remember

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:34.320
the name of that game. Somebody usually knows it, or we get instant game reviews on these

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:40.360
games we haven't, you know, we're too poor to check out. So, just loving the chat, chat.hornsonshortheday.com.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:45.480
Anyway, let's talk about Quake Live, and this is one I am excited to check this out, because

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:49.480
this is the one, this is Quake, but now it's in your browser, and I guess it's going to

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.280
be free and ad-supported. I'm so excited about this.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.360
Was this one based off Quake 3 or something? I think it is Quake 3, yes, but Quake Live

01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:01.360
is apparently going to start the open beta this next week. All the statistics that are

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.960
being, that are on the server now, they're going to be kicked out from the closed beta.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.200
Tuesday, February 24th is apparently when the open beta testing period is going to be

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:18.080
announced. Quake Live, again, is a web-based version of Quake. So, pretty exciting. I'm

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.760
sure they're going to change some things. I don't think it's just a port of the game,

01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:26.100
but yeah, all you have to do if you want to check this out, just go to www.quakelive.com

01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:34.680
on February 24th, and check it out, and maybe I'll be there playing, because I love playing

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.440
Quake back in my college days in the dorms. Quake and Quake 3, I mean, the original Quake

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:43.160
I'm a little more partial to, but I did love Quake 3. Quake 2, I did not get into.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.160
Did you play ASCII Quake? Huh?

01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.160
Did you play ASCII Quake?

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:49.720
Actually, I think I did. I seem to recall that, yes.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.240
Well, here's some different joy. Joy has a much different variety for those of us who

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.120
have iPhones and iPod Touches. Rob, you're in the club. You'll be happy.

01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.120
Yes.

01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:09.240
Oregon Trail is going to be on the iPhone and iPod Touch, Gameloft is making it, and

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:16.560
you will be going from Independence, Michigan to Willamette Valley in Oregon, and it will

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:21.520
be available probably the end of this month or beginning of next, with no price announced

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:30.080
yet, but hey, it's Oregon Trail. It has skill-based minigames, and some of them use the accelerometer,

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:31.640
and you can die of dysentery.

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:35.400
I know. I was going to say, now I can ford the river wherever I go. That'd be awesome.

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:36.400
Yes.

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.400
Great.

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:38.400
It actually looks pretty good.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:43.080
That's what Enfolded Raptor in our chat room says. Dysentery on the go. Somebody in our

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:48.400
chat room, I don't even know if I should say the name, because they were in the NDA beta,

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:55.280
and it says, everybody play it, the Quake Live, so apparently it's really good, and

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:59.080
I'm hearing a lot of endorsements for it, so sounds good.

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.840
All right, let's move on. Just a couple more stories, and we're going to open up our Skype

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:07.160
line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be opening that

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:09.640
very soon. We just got a couple quick more stories for you guys.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.920
Yes, speaking of beta testing, Sony is looking for some new game testers as well. What will

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:21.280
you be possibly playing? A new game machine. Hmm. People are thinking that's going to be

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:27.640
either part of the Playstation Portable series, or possibly maybe even like a Playstation

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:33.200
phone or something like that. Could it be possibly the Playstation 4? I may have to

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.280
go early for that, but I can see maybe like the PSP 4000 or something.

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:42.560
Could it be a new enhancement to Playstation 3? Could it be like a new home, I don't know,

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.840
like a home type thing, like an expansion that all Playstation users will have? Is that

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.000
a possibility, or is this like hardware? It's going to be hardware. New game machine.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.080
Interesting. It's probably a PSP version too. It says basically they're looking for someone,

01:48:56.080 --> 01:49:01.500
it's a job listing on Sony Computer Entertainment, Japan's website. It says it's asking for someone

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:07.280
to evaluate and assess a new game machine. Ponzi in our chat room suggests it will be

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:12.360
the PS 2.5. Could it be yet another reiteration of the Playstation 2, you think?

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:18.440
Maybe, well not the PS 2, maybe like a new PSP, like kind of like the DSi that's enhanced

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.960
with the old stuff. They just had a new PSP, didn't they?

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.440
Yeah, but I'm talking about like when it actually redesigns the PSP.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:27.640
Like a PSP part 2. Not like something that, oh look now it has

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:31.880
a microphone on it, that's retarded. Or, oh look, now it's a little bit slimmer. I'm talking

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:37.220
about something that actually, oh look, it's another analog stick. Or, you know, now the

01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:42.280
screen's bigger and shinier, I don't know. Now I can make phone calls with it.

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:48.680
We'll see. I know, but every, you see, every time I hear about like gaming phones, I get

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:53.400
really nervous because I think about the N-Gage, you know, and just what a crap system that

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.520
was. What? The N-Gage was crap from the beginning.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.400
But then the iPhone is kind of cool. Don't worry.

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:03.680
Super cool. Don't worry though, the Gizmondo is still

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:07.680
coming out, I think. I actually liked that game that I played

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.200
on the Gizmondo, the, the guitar game. That was pretty fun.

01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:14.160
The Johnny whatever, was that what it was called?

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:16.480
Yeah. Wow, how do I remember that?

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.180
That was, it was actually a fun little game. Huh.

01:50:19.180 --> 01:50:24.280
When I could hear it at E3 years and years ago.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.840
One of the wonderful downsides to E3. Acidic Vampire says he wants the PSP to make

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:32.800
dinner and bring a beer. What?

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:39.440
I don't know. Game Guru, you were like, do you have an iPhone?

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:43.040
Because if you have an iPhone, you're allowed to, to make that assessment.

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:47.400
So, he said the iPhone is a lousy gaming device.

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:50.880
You're allowed to make that assessment if you've actually played games on one for a

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:54.320
significant amount of time. Alright, let me move on.

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.840
I got one more story, then we'll open up the Skype Live.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:00.920
Maybe they'll call in, who knows. Hideo Kojima is going to get another Lifetime

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.320
Achievement Award. He's only 45 years old, by the way, but he

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:09.360
has met his Lifetime Achievement from the Game Developers Choice Awards, which are happening

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.000
on March 25th. So Hideo Kojima is going to be getting that

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.480
award. You know, because he kind of made Metal Gear

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.840
and all. So, kind of makes sense that, you know, he's

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:24.700
probably nominated for something like this and is getting this.

01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:28.400
By the way, this is his second award in just a short time.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:33.220
His first award was a Lifetime Achievement Award from the MTV Game Awards that wasn't

01:51:33.220 --> 01:51:35.480
here in the U.S. That was in Germany, by the way, where Hideo

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:39.120
Kojima got that award. So, kind of interesting, because last week

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:41.640
I know we had a big story on the Metreon. We were talking about how the Metreon had

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:45.880
that Walk of Fame in it, and then, you know, now the Metreon's big Sony store is closing.

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.920
And we were wondering if they even did that Walk of Fame anymore.

01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.840
Kind of, kind of goes hand in hand with that. I'm sure Hideo Kojima probably has a little

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:55.440
star or whatever they call it on that Walk of Fame.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:58.880
But who knows? I do remember where that was, though.

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:01.280
I remember walking on that before they had anybody in it.

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.280
It was like an elevated platform, if I remember right.

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:06.800
It was kind of interesting. Anyhow, random story.

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:12.200
Now let's take your random calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.200
The Skype line is now open, and we'll get to those calls momentarily.

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.880
There's a little, like, gap between when we say something live and when they actually

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.560
go out over the radio. Oh, nope, we're getting a call already.

01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:26.240
So we'll take this call, and then we'll get some last-minute stories.

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:28.560
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.360
Deathwishing.

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.840
Hello, Deathwishing. What's on your mind?

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:33.520
Street Fighter IV.

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.480
Yes. We were talking about that at the very, very, very top of the show.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.480
Are you, I'm assuming you're a fan?

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:40.160
I just picked it up, actually.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.920
You just picked it up?

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:45.280
I played it when I was, like, five, and I never really got serious at it, and I just

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:50.480
figured, time to get serious at it, and I get my ass beat, but I'm having fun getting

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:51.200
my ass beat.

01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:55.280
Now, when I hear you say you haven't played it since you were five, I'm assuming that

01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:58.560
means Street Fighter II, right?

01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:01.200
It was a Street Fighter cabinet. That's all I know.

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:04.800
Wow. Because maybe it was, like, an old, old-school Street Fighter game. That one didn't even

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:08.400
play like any of the others, but all right. So, what, you've been playing this online,

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:09.360
and just getting your ass beat?

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:11.120
I've been playing as Sakura, pretty much.

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.400
Yeah? Do you have a-

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.520
Because too many Kens. Too many Ken Barbie doll people.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.960
Really? I've kind of seen a mixture of people online. What about-

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.440
Play Dan.

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:23.360
I've played a- somebody was playing Crimson Viper. I played one of those.

01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:23.680
Dan's homo.

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:24.800
And, uh-

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:30.160
What? If you can kick somebody's ass with Dan, then you are awesome.

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:38.320
Um, so, well, what about this whole accessibility thing, where, uh, you, uh, they say this game

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.720
is very accessible, and you say you haven't played this for a long time.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:41.840
Like noobs? Like me?

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:42.340
Yeah.

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.800
I'm getting my ass beat a lot.

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.040
What about against the computer?

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:50.320
Well, against the computer, you can progress up. I've-

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.200
I mean, the AI in the game is ruthless, though. Holy crap.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.680
Seth. My god.

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.920
Yeah, we were talking about how Seth is a bastard.

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:00.480
He's very-

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.720
All I know is, don't use the 360 controller for it. I have to use that.

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.360
It sucks. I almost got it on PlayStation 3, based on the controller alone,

01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:13.200
but then I realized, I think I know, like, maybe two or three people playing it on PlayStation 3,

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:16.880
and I know far more on the 360, so I finally caved and got the 360.

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:17.680
Actually, I do have to say-

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:22.160
All I know is, like, if you want to play, it's like, invest in a fight pad,

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:24.800
because I heard those are really good, and they're like the Sega controller,

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:28.000
and then, like, the tournament edition stick is super accurate.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.160
Like, you can just pull out the same move over and over.

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.680
Those little pads, they're good, too?

01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.560
Yeah, we've got one.

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:35.040
Really?

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.080
Yeah, they're pretty good.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.680
I'm gonna have to come to your house and test one.

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:38.720
Keep in mind, we first-

01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:40.400
No, not your house.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:44.880
We pre-ordered it on PS3, and we actually paid for a tournament stick,

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.040
and then we switched it to Xbox 360,

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.520
so we have to go find another way to get a tournament stick,

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:54.080
but in the meantime, Dan got the little fighting pad.

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.600
It's pretty good.

01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:57.280
How was that the GameStop tournaments?

01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:58.880
How was that?

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:02.640
I've heard some reports coming in from plenty of those around the country.

01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:03.440
How did you do?

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.800
One beat five people,

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:10.320
then got beat by a guy who's ranked three in California.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:11.040
Wait, wait, wait.

01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:13.680
But you've not played the game since you were, like, five,

01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.120
yet you did that well in the tournament?

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.600
Because I chose a place to go to that I knew people would walk in to be like,

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:20.640
oh, look, a tournament.

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.760
Oh, like at the mall or something?

01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:24.320
Yeah.

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.680
Okay, that makes sense.

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.720
That makes sense.

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:27.220
Huh.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.760
Plus I bought the games two days before it came out.

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.880
Wait, you said you were in California.

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:31.760
Where in California?

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:33.200
Southern.

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:35.360
Oh, okay, down in the LA area.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.920
Well, you get lots of looky-loos in the malls down there anyway,

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.720
so it makes sense.

01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:42.080
All right, well, anything else on your mind tonight, Death Wishing?

01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:45.120
Um, Killzone 2.

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:46.880
Yeah, looking forward to that.

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.840
Um, I've actually saw there's someone on JTV playing it,

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.720
and it looks great, and I don't have a PS3,

01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.720
and I'm a huge fan of the Killzone series.

01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.920
Uh, you can get those demo codes, though, right?

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:01.280
But only if you, what, pre-ordered it?

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:02.800
Yeah, if you pre-ordered the game,

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.960
you could have got, like, the multiplayer demo or something.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:05.460
Yeah.

01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:08.160
Yeah, I think that's just the normal demo, actually.

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.320
Well, I saw some people giving away codes on Twitter for it,

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.480
so I know it must have been kind of hard to get, so...

01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.440
It's not hard to get, you just create a European account and done.

01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:16.560
Ah, Sneaky Sneaky.

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.120
I have it on my PS3 right now, I mean, so...

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:19.840
Sneaky Sneaky.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:21.840
Thank you, British people.

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:23.280
Well, then maybe we need to,

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.680
we need to fire up Killzone and compete with the other channel.

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.800
No, I have no idea who else is showing it, but...

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:31.120
It's hot-blooded gaming or something, I don't know.

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:33.680
It's so interesting, when we first started on Justin TV,

01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:36.480
there really was not a lot of gaming stuff on there at all,

01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:40.640
but now there's tons of people just kind of showing what they play on there, so...

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.480
But, hey, props to them.

01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:45.680
It's definitely expanded the community over there on Justin TV, so...

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.360
Alright, well, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls,

01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.640
but thanks for the call, buddy, alright?

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:49.200
Alright, thanks.

01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:49.760
Have a good one.

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:50.320
Have a good day.

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:51.120
And, yeah, you too.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.240
And good job in the tournament, for, you know, that's still pretty good.

01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:55.920
Noobs or not.

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.360
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:02.960
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Agdeft.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.720
Hello, Agdeft, how are you doing?

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.160
I'm pretty fine right now.

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:07.600
Awesome, awesome.

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:11.760
We have a little bit of lag, probably because of the fact that you are in another country,

01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.960
so why don't you go ahead and ask us your question, or whatever you called in about tonight.

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:21.760
Well, I basically wanted to talk about Street Fighter IV here in Mexico, because

01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:29.200
something pretty bad happened, especially with the collector's edition for PlayStation 3.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:30.800
Please, tell us about it.

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:35.360
It's a pretty big shortage.

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:38.080
How did it happen?

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:39.120
How did the shortage happen?

01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:44.960
Well, nobody knows how it happened.

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:45.840
It just happened.

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:54.400
Basically, most of the stores that had pre-orders for the Street Fighter IV version on the PS3,

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:58.720
the collector's edition one, basically got cut off by Capcom,

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:06.400
and they didn't get sent all the pre-orders they had in stock, or they had planned to sell.

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.040
That's so strange.

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:12.800
Were they redirected to the US to maybe meet demand?

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.480
And they were like, well, we could screw over other countries if we meet the demand here.

01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:17.680
It seems a little odd.

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:26.480
Yeah, most people are thinking that, and that's pretty much it, because it got sold out in the US.

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:33.680
Screw Mexico, possibly, so I'm sorry for the PS3 owners that wanted the collector's edition,

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:36.480
because it's a pretty good one.

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.320
It's a pretty good deal you're getting on that box.

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.240
Yeah, that is kind of a bummer.

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.400
Sometimes we forget, we're kind of spoiled living here in the US sometimes.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:50.000
Just out of curiosity, to kind of put it in perspective, how much would you be paying

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.920
for the collector's edition over there, for Street Fighter IV?

01:58:53.920 --> 01:59:06.720
If I'm correct, I'm pretty sure it's around 1,500 pesos for the collector's edition,

01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:14.640
and 1,000 for the regular edition, though most people on the, not to call it the black market,

01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:25.440
but maybe what they call here at the Anglies, that would be a flea market or a swap meet.

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:29.600
They could sell it for over 2,000 pesos.

01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:35.040
That would be like around $150 on the US.

01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:37.440
Wow, yeah, I'm just looking at conversion rates right now.

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:45.360
It's about 10.8 pesos to the dollar.

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:48.240
So let's see, he said it would be about 1,500 to get it legitimately.

01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:50.960
Divide that by 10.8598.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:54.880
It's actually 1,450.

01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:58.640
Wow, that's like $138 though, or 130 bucks.

01:59:59.280 --> 01:59:59.840
Wow.

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:00.320
Yeah.

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:04.720
So sometimes we're a little spoiled here, so we have to remember that.

02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:08.240
Well, you know, maybe next time you need to get some friends in the US

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:10.240
and just mail you the game or something.

02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:12.480
You probably get it faster and cheaper.

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:15.600
Yeah, yeah, most possibly.

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:23.520
It's a good thing that I got the 360 version over at Amazon, so I'm not gonna worry about it.

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:25.760
Out of curiosity, I don't know if you know the answer to this or not,

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:28.240
but are you able to order games from the US?

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.160
Like say you can order a game from amazon.com in the US and have it shipped to Mexico,

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:35.680
or did they not do that?

02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:38.800
I'm basically, I'm getting some help from my friend.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.560
The game is going to be delivered over the US.

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:48.080
Since I'm pretty much next to the border, he can go and pick it up.

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.960
I just paid with my Mexican credit card.

02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:55.920
That I can do, but I cannot get shipped games over here.

02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.240
I can get movies and I think books, but everything else, no.

02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:07.760
I do have to say, it's actually for Amazon UK, I can order books and they'll ship here,

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.160
but I can't order a game or a toy from the UK.

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:16.160
I'd have to ship it to a UK address.

02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:18.560
Well, plus you'd get into region issues at that point, right?

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:23.920
Yeah, when I was trying to order Doctor Who toys, I couldn't have them shipped to me.

02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:24.400
Bummer.

02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:25.680
Because I wanted a Cyberman.

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:28.480
But we have listener friends in the UK that could help you out, right?

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:28.960
I'm sure.

02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.480
All right, that's cool.

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:31.280
All right, well, act deaf.

02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:33.840
We got to wrap things up and let you go, but do you have any other quick final thoughts

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.120
you want to get out there before we let you go?

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:43.040
Well, even though we got screwed on the previous version of the collector's edition of Street

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:49.040
Fighter IV, basically the rest of the world, Mexico, Japan, and Europe got the 360 Ring

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.240
controller that it has a definitely better D-pad.

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:55.840
I have two controllers here with me and they definitely work.

02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:00.400
And it's basically the same controller as the white one that comes with the console.

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:06.960
Though the D-pad, you see it and it's the same, but you feel it and it's definitely better.

02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:12.480
I really hope they think about Super Street Fighter Turbo with it and it's better.

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:16.000
I really hope they think about bringing that pad over here to the US.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:16.560
That would be great.

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:19.520
But at least we have those fighting game pads that apparently are pretty good.

02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:20.960
So I'm going to definitely check that out.

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:22.320
Anyway, act deaf.

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:23.280
Have a good one, buddy.

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:26.320
Thanks so much for the call and good luck on your quest for Street Fighter IV.

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:29.200
And sorry to hear that you guys got the shaft on that one.

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:30.080
That's always a bummer.

02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:30.800
Take care, buddy.

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:32.800
Yeah, thanks.

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:33.840
All right.

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.360
If you want to give us a call, we'll take another one.

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:38.720
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:40.400
But wait, we already have a call dropped in.

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:41.520
Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.000
Who's this?

02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:46.080
It's a kind of exhausted Jason.

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.320
Jason, am I exhausting you from all my needy tells about the podcast feed?

02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:51.360
I'm like, I don't understand.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:52.720
I follow Deep Man's instructions.

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:53.760
That just put it on the website.

02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:54.880
It didn't put it on the feed.

02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:55.680
Help me, Jason.

02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:57.040
No, it's actually kind of weird.

02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:59.440
I haven't, it's, I don't know.

02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:01.040
And then it disappeared from the website.

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:01.360
I don't know.

02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.800
I need to talk to Deep Man about it.

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:03.200
I don't know.

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:04.880
I'm confused.

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:06.960
But I have one more episode to get us all caught up.

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:08.720
And then I'm going to try and get tonight's episode up.

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:10.720
I don't know if it'll realistically happen tomorrow.

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:12.480
Tomorrow is my mother's birthday.

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.320
So I have to, you know, go out and spend some time with her.

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:20.480
Which by the way, if I am not mistaking, this is 68.

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:21.440
My mother's going to be.

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.040
So, yep.

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:24.240
Anyhow, sorry.

02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.360
Not that everybody cares.

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:27.920
But anyways, Jason, what'd you call and talk about tonight?

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:29.920
I was going to say that your parents are old.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:33.200
But at the same time, you are also older than me.

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:33.680
Yeah, I am 30.

02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:34.640
By a fair margin.

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.200
So it kind of...

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.440
But my parents had me late.

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:38.960
My mom had me when she was 38.

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:39.840
No wait, that would make sense.

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.120
She'd have to be turning 69.

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.040
Wow, I'm a bad kid.

02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:44.480
I don't even know how old my mom is.

02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:47.600
But you know, it all starts to blend together after 65.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.920
So yeah, I guess she's going to be 69, actually.

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.720
So anyhow, what'd you call in about?

02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:54.160
Surely you didn't call in and talk about my mom.

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.080
I don't know.

02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:56.880
That's kind of...

02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:02.880
Anyways, the Tony Hawk story is kind of interesting.

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:05.760
Because the only thing that comes to mind...

02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.200
There's only two things that come to mind when they talk about a custom controller.

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.760
The first one is the arcade cabinet.

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:20.160
The skateboard that Top Skater had in the entire arcade cabinet setup.

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:24.320
And then the only other thing that comes to mind is that since we have wireless controllers now,

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:30.160
something resembling like those tech decks that were really popular between 5 and 10 years ago.

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:34.240
Wow, I haven't heard about a tech deck in a long time.

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:34.960
Okay, okay.

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:36.640
Exactly, exactly.

02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:41.760
And it's just kind of... I'm trying to envision myself...

02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:43.120
First of all, I sucked with those things.

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.680
I couldn't do anything on those stupid things.

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:52.480
But no matter which way I try to think of it logistically,

02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:57.520
it just doesn't seem to stick out as to any kind of a good experience.

02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:01.360
I mean, the whole design behind Top Skater was that

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:05.920
the tighter timing you have to the best part of the jump, the better trick you do.

02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:10.960
And there's only two, maybe three tricks you can do per thing of timing.

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:13.920
And that's whether you nollie off the front, ollie off the back.

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:17.360
And I think the angle might make a difference too or something like that.

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:21.040
Or the way that you shift the skateboard on its mount.

02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:24.880
But it's just... it sounds so stupid to me.

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:28.560
Because we have a controller that works for this stuff already.

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:32.160
It's the same thing that I said with home on the PS3.

02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.520
We have an interface, we have a system that works.

02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.760
You come up with a stupid gimmick like this,

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:41.920
and it's going to artificially inflate the cost and be stupid.

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:43.200
This game is on the Wii, right?

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.360
Nope, PS3 and 360.

02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:47.840
Wow, I was just saying, it's probably on the Wii.

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:48.400
It's another...

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:49.120
Well, it's probably going to be on the Wii as well.

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:50.800
They're used to stupid gimmicks over there.

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:52.480
Oh, I don't know.

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:56.080
It's just really weird to think about.

02:05:56.960 --> 02:06:02.560
It's the unfortunate downside to Guitar Hero and Rock Band being very popular.

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:08.400
And the Wii, actually all three of those things getting popular roughly around all the same time,

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:15.440
has put this stigma out there that, wow, all these extra peripherals can sell like crazy!

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:17.760
And so now we've got things like this.

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:23.200
Not that the power pad is ever really something to legitimize at all,

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.840
but the... or rather the power glove.

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.120
The power glove, the track and field mat,

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:35.840
the... whatever that Sega Genesis controller beam, octagon...

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:36.400
Activator.

02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.360
... was.

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.640
Wasn't it the activator?

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:39.040
Yeah.

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:39.600
Yeah.

02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:40.880
I had an activator.

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.080
I know, they were awesome.

02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:44.480
I just want to say, though, about the power pad.

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:49.120
That... the power pad was badass when I was a kid, because I was probably like,

02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:50.640
you know, I'm a little older than the rest of you,

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:54.080
and I was probably like 9 or 10 when the power pad first came out.

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:57.600
We used to have a blast playing freaking track meet,

02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:01.040
and I will... well, first off, I remember for the long jump,

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.360
the trick was you jump off the pad,

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:07.040
and then jump back on, fly just like so far,

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.800
but also the other thing would be short order and eggsplode.

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:12.560
That game was awesome.

02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:15.120
I have never heard of that.

02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:16.880
Short order eggsplode, look it up.

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:19.120
That's... that should be a classic game of the week sometime.

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:20.240
That was a power pad.

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.040
It was basically like... it was like Simon, you know,

02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:26.480
like the... I remember that was one of it was the one game was

02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:29.280
you had to make a burger by jumping around the pad

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:31.760
to different things to add the lettuce and all this stuff,

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:33.760
and then the other one... I swear to God, this is the game.

02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:35.760
Oh, so it's like live-action burger time.

02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:38.800
But it was kind of... it was two games in one,

02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:40.960
because then eggsplode was something completely different,

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:44.720
which is basically like you step on the particular button to get the egg.

02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:45.680
It was a little silly.

02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:46.800
Interesting.

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:47.600
Dance Aerobics.

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:50.400
I played them all. I played all those power pad games.

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:53.200
I never had an NES, so my power pad gaming,

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:56.560
it was limited to the track and field, of course.

02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:57.520
Right. Anyway, sorry.

02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:00.720
I'm actually kind of glad to see somebody talking about the props...

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:01.920
about Prop Cycle.

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:05.280
That was... that was a big, expensive rig,

02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.160
but that was a really good game.

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:08.000
I love Prop Cycle so much.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.680
Prop Cycle gets props.

02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:11.680
Did you have... no, look online.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:14.880
Did you ever see the Prop Cycle that hooked up to an Addams Family pinball?

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.720
Trust me, just look it up.

02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.480
What a pointless fucking combination.

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:24.000
It's... it's... it's brilliant and stupid at the same time.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:25.120
Just... just look it up.

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:28.560
I'll find a link and put it in the chat room.

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:29.280
Sounds good to me.

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:33.120
You know, we... Dark Sakura, we need more content on the website,

02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:36.480
and I'm thinking one thing you ought to do is like a brilliant but stupid column,

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:37.920
and that should be something that you put in there.

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:38.480
Okay.

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:39.360
Like in gaming.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.560
Brilliant but stupid.

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:43.280
We'll see.

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:45.920
All right, Jason, any other quick thoughts before we let you go, buddy?

02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.200
The GT... the GTA 4 loss in the damn controversy you guys were talking about before.

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:51.680
Yes.

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:52.320
The debate.

02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:53.920
I'm so tired of it in general.

02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:58.400
You know they did it just... just to see what would happen.

02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.520
You know that's why they did it.

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:00.880
Because they don't make every layer.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.120
If you make a person, the texture is closed.

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.000
Well, here's the other thing, and I should have brought this up earlier in the show,

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.520
because who knows how many people have actually listened this far two and a half hours in the show.

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:12.160
Here's the thing.

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:16.880
I bet they did it this way, because the peen isn't really on the disc.

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:18.240
It's not in the game.

02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:20.640
It's in the download content.

02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:26.240
It's almost like the reverse of hot coffee, where you had to like hack the disc or whatever.

02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:32.160
You know, basically, you know, basically use the little code to unlock the sex scene.

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:32.640
All right.

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.640
It's like the complete reverse of that.

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:38.080
I feel like they almost did this just like... like they knew...

02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.040
This is the finger.

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:46.000
They knew in the beginning they wanted to put the peen in the game, but they thought,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.080
no, let's do it in the download content.

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.360
Because then people who get mad and want to take this game off shelves, well, it's not

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:52.480
really in the game.

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.280
You have to consciously pay to download or whatever.

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:56.240
A little weird.

02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:59.040
Jason, did you see the picture?

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:01.440
No, I haven't.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.200
I tend to stop clicking around and whatnot when I'm on a call.

02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:05.680
All right.

02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.120
Well, we'll let you go so you can go check that out and post your things in chat.

02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.440
But thanks for the call as always, Jason.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:11.920
Yep.

02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:14.880
And thank you for my venting earlier when I couldn't get the podcast up.

02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:15.600
Of course.

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:18.880
People sometimes forget you're a big part of this show as well, even though it may not

02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:21.120
be your voice they have to hear for three hours every Sunday.

02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:23.840
So how would you play that game?

02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:24.320
All right.

02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:24.880
Take care, Jason.

02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:25.360
Night.

02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:30.560
How would you be able to play Adam Sandler football like that?

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:31.520
You just...

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.840
You pretty much, as far as I'm aware, you're pretty much just running the machine while

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:38.160
you're on the prop cycle and triggering stuff.

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:41.120
Let's do a couple of last minute stories and we'll do one more call because we didn't take

02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:42.080
a lot of calls last week.

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:43.840
So we'll get to like one more call tonight.

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.840
So yeah, Loki?

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:46.880
There's a contest.

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:51.520
Well, I don't know really if it's a contest, but basically Codemasters wants you to name

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:57.280
your baby Jason in the UK because they're trying to get their game Rise of the Argonauts.

02:10:57.280 --> 02:11:03.360
They're trying to get Jason to the top of the UK's top 50 most popular baby names.

02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:04.720
That is completely dumb.

02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:11.280
And if you do name your baby Jason because of this, I hope you get your tubes tied soon

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:11.760
after.

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:12.000
Yeah.

02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:14.480
Brilliant and stupid.

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:15.440
Not brilliant at all.

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:16.160
It's just stupid.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:16.720
It's just stupid.

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:17.840
It's just stupid.

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.800
Now, if you name your kid Jason for other reasons, you know, you have a grandpa named

02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:24.320
Jason or you just like the name.

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:24.960
That's fine.

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.600
But if you name it, Jason, because Friday the 13th.

02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:28.800
All right.

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:30.000
Look, we got another call on the line.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.040
I don't want to keep him waiting.

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:31.200
Hi.

02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:32.240
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:32.640
Who's this?

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:33.440
Yeah.

02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:34.000
What up, guys?

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.280
It's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:35.760
How you doing?

02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:36.560
Xenocore, how you doing?

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:37.520
We haven't heard from you in a while.

02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:39.040
How are things going at Ultimate Quest?

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.480
We haven't heard from Footy in a while either.

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:41.600
Yeah.

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:45.040
Lots of real world stuff is kind of hitting us all at the moment.

02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:46.960
I moved and got a new job.

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:49.360
Footy's in the middle of finals, you know, this, that, the other thing.

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:53.600
So we are planning on coming back, but we got to get our real lives in order first.

02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:55.840
I was going to say, I think you've got Star Ocean this week.

02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.120
So you're going to need to get things together because that's, that's a big RPG.

02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:00.960
Yeah, that's true.

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.760
That's true.

02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.480
But I've been focusing in other areas since I was cut off from the interwebs, you know,

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:08.880
sort of need an internet connection to do the MMO thing.

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:09.120
True.

02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:14.560
So I went back to some of my old conquests and dug up a copy of Falcon 4 after I heard

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:17.280
Tandric's mate mention it on his show the other day.

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:24.160
And on top of that, the new release of 40K Dawn of War 2 just came out.

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:27.040
Oh, that's, that's the Warhammer one?

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.200
Yeah, the Warhammer RTS game.

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:29.440
Yeah.

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:31.760
They just released version two.

02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:37.520
That was that one that they, didn't they not put it on GameStop shelves because it

02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:39.040
was coming out on Steam or something.

02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:41.280
It was this whole thing going on back and forth.

02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:41.520
Okay.

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:41.680
Yeah.

02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:42.560
I know what this game is.

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:42.720
Yeah.

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:43.200
How is it?

02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.040
Yeah, it's pretty good.

02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:50.640
It's probably the closest to the actual figurine tabletop game yet, which for fanboys

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.000
like me is great, but for some other people, they don't like it too much.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.480
It's more tactical than it is strategic.

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:00.400
Dark Soccer is not a big fan of the little figurines in Warhammer.

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:03.520
She went on a tangential, but that's just because of her prior relationship.

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:05.600
She was a lot years and years ago.

02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:08.960
I've still heard rumors to the effect of Tyranids being incredibly broken.

02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:12.960
Well, well, not so much now.

02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:16.160
I mean, things are pretty well balanced.

02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.040
It's just online.

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:20.560
You really have to pay attention to what you're doing because there is no base building

02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:20.880
in this.

02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:23.440
Everything is done by putting your troops out in the field.

02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:29.360
So where you position them and what areas are looking in are a lot more important than

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:30.560
what they used to be.

02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.480
Speaking of Warhammer, I have a random question.

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:32.880
I'm sorry.

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:36.880
This probably isn't what you called in to talk about, but Warhammer online, is this

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:41.600
turning into the next Age of Conan where like it has a huge launch, does very well, and

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:48.080
then, you know, like it's, I get the sense I'm getting is that Warhammer is kind of not

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:53.120
maintaining the large user base it had at get go or am I completely wrong?

02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:53.840
Does anybody know?

02:13:54.640 --> 02:14:00.640
Well, if you look at it, the guys who built Warhammer Mythic, I mean, they're known for

02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:05.760
their PVP stuff from Dark Age of Camelot, and that's pretty much what this game is built

02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:06.560
towards.

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:11.600
So if you're not into it for the PVP, you may not want to last as long because, you

02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:13.520
know, there's only a 40 level cap.

02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:18.080
You know, the end game comes a lot sooner, mainly to get you into PVP stuff.

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:22.320
So if, you know, going up against other players isn't your thing, then you're sort of going

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.840
to get turned off from it after a while.

02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:29.760
And you run out of PVE content pretty quickly, or at least so I've heard from my friends

02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:30.400
who play it.

02:14:30.400 --> 02:14:30.800
Interesting.

02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.160
I was playing it for a little while, and it's not that I dislike the game, but at the time

02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:36.400
I was so sucked into WoW, I couldn't balance two games.

02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:37.040
So I had to cut one of those.

02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:37.920
Oh look, another public quest.

02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:39.280
Oh look, same public quest.

02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:40.000
Oh no, we were out of public quests.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.800
You know, I thought those public quests were actually a pretty neat idea.

02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:43.680
Like, that was kind of cool.

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:49.600
It had some neat ideas, so that's why I'm a little sad to hear it's bleeding out users,

02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:55.600
but, you know, at the same time, if not everybody's in it for PVP, that could make sense, so.

02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:58.560
But I don't think that it's going to go away, though.

02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.400
I think it's going to stay above critical mass.

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:04.480
It'll just be one of those other ones that are just sitting quietly in the corner, like

02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:09.440
EverQuest and EverQuest 2 and Planetside and all these other classic ones that are still

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:09.840
running.

02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:13.120
Here's another game I played this week, I didn't talk about my gaming week, but I actually

02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:16.480
went back and checked out Phantasy Star Universe for a little while, and you would be surprised,

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:22.240
on the Xbox 360, Block 1 and Block 2 are still full a lot of the times, especially during

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:23.200
primetime gaming hours.

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:27.920
You know, they still have, you would think that game would be completely dead, but they

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:31.040
still have a very loyal user base in there, which was amazing because they still have

02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:35.200
Christmas decorations up, although I think they get away with it because they call it

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:40.560
Winter something, so technically it's still winter, but, interesting.

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:46.160
One other thing, did anybody in your area or anybody listening happen to get into the

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.600
GameStop Street Fighter IV competition that happened this weekend?

02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:51.600
I did not go, did anybody in the room go?

02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:57.120
I don't think so, but we did have a caller just a little bit ago talk about his experience

02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.200
there in Southern California, but did you go?

02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:05.200
Yeah, there was one in Jacksonville, luckily enough, I went in, got to Round 2, and I got

02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:09.360
my ass, well, not handed to me, it was a 3-2 victory for him, but he's an old schooler

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:13.280
like me, so I didn't feel too bad about it, and he actually ended up winning the store,

02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:14.880
so I was content with that.

02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:17.440
Well, if you're going to lose to someone, lose to the eventual winner, I suppose.

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:19.360
Exactly, exactly.

02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:22.640
That's what I felt, like, back in the days of DDR, like, I don't know if a lot of people

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:26.400
know, but I used to do Perfect Attack in DDR in tournaments and stuff, and, you know, like,

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.280
I came in fourth, which was probably as high as I would go in some tournaments, but, you

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:33.120
know, usually when I would lose, I would lose to the person who would eventually win, so

02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:35.120
it didn't feel so bad.

02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:40.480
So, those were the days, oh man, I wish I could do some of that now, but now if I probably

02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:45.600
played a 9-footer on DDR, I'd be like, where's my inhaler?

02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.880
So, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Xenocore, before

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:51.440
we let you go?

02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:57.840
Yeah, just that, that feeling of being in the tournament, everybody talking smack, all

02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:03.520
waiting for their turn, and getting sent home, crying, I miss that from the arcades, that

02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:06.240
needs to come back, but that's pretty much it, that's all I have, guys, so.

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:09.120
We'll see, maybe they'll do some more of this, we'll see.

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:12.640
All right, well, Xenocore, take care, buddy, and have a good one, and good luck with Ultimate

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:13.440
Quest, come back soon.

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:18.720
All right, we're going to go ahead and close the Skype line for now, because we've taken

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:21.600
lots and lots of calls tonight, and we still have a cage match we've got to get to at some

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:27.680
point, and yeah, I heard one of our, one of our frequent listeners and callers, TheRobD,

02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:30.960
apparently did pretty well in this tournament.

02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:34.080
I don't know if he won his store, or runner-up, or whatever, okay, what are you laughing about,

02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:34.880
DarkSira?

02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:36.400
Just the prop cycle.

02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:38.080
Oh, you nerd.

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:41.760
All right, so yeah, I was just reading about that in chat, and it reminded me, because

02:17:41.760 --> 02:17:46.000
I saw a LiveJournal post to his that said that he did pretty well, so congrats to him,

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:50.000
and apparently he's got, he's like, I'm sure he's number one on my friends list and stuff

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.240
online, he's pretty insanely good at Street Fighter.

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:55.360
I have to play him once and lose to him, just for the little factor.

02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:59.520
All right, Loki, any other last minute stories you want to get to?

02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:06.160
Yeah, it's rumored that, or I guess Sony is saying God of War 3 and MAG are coming within

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:13.120
the year, of course, MAG being that massive action game, and these will be like blockbuster

02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:20.320
exclusives, and yeah, no word on when they're possibly going to come, although if I were

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:28.640
a guessing man, perhaps God of War 3 might be coming out around July-ish, but we don't

02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:31.680
know, so it's just a guess.

02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:33.440
Summer's a good time to release games.

02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:41.680
July especially, there's what, NCAA football and NCAA football, that's about it, at least

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:43.280
for July.

02:18:43.280 --> 02:18:50.480
Well, Braid, we talked about that earlier in the show, and if you thought $15 was too

02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:55.200
much for Braid, well, you're in luck, they're dropping the price this week to 800 Microsoft

02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.440
points or $10.

02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.320
Great for sales!

02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:03.120
Haven't played it yet, you get a chance to play it now.

02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:04.320
I had a story, too.

02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.880
Oh, well, Dr. Stalker, go ahead.

02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:09.600
Just jump right in there, cut Loki off.

02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:12.080
Oh, he does it to me all the time, I thought it was fair.

02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:15.200
I'm kidding, go ahead with your story, I was actually just trying to remind you that I

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:16.080
had one later.

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:22.480
Apparently, Microsoft overpaid some layoff severances, and now they want their money

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:36.080
back, and I guess in administrative error, they had meant to pay off their 1,400 employees

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:40.640
that they had just recently laid off, but they actually had put a little bit too much

02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:46.080
money in their severance packages, and they now want it back, and it says, according to

02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:51.760
this, we ask that you repay the overpayment and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience

02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:52.400
to you.

02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:54.480
Yeah, I know, just a minor inconvenience.

02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:57.280
That's kind of messed up, I don't know.

02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:00.560
All right, yeah, you know what's funny?

02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:04.240
I actually had something like that happen to me once, I don't want to say at what job,

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:08.560
it was a long, long time ago, long, long time ago, like I was younger, and they totally

02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:12.800
overpaid me on my last check, and not by much, but like a hundred bucks, but when you're

02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:14.560
like 18, that's a lot of money.

02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:20.240
So, you know, thankfully they didn't ask for it back, because at that age, I don't know

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:21.200
how I would have paid that back.

02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:23.920
So, anyhow.

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:27.520
All right, Jamie, why don't you go ahead and do your last minute story?

02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:28.640
It's a little dumb story.

02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:29.360
Sure, go for it.

02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:34.160
It was actually, it was not dumb, because it was linked to me from Alpha Cananagram,

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:39.520
in chat, that they're selling Noby Noby Boy shirts at panic.com.

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:40.800
Nice.

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:46.000
They're funny, there's the 12 inch version, the 24 inch version, the 48 inch version,

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.320
and the 144 inch version.

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:52.320
See, they should have like the head actually start up here, like at the center of the neck,

02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:56.160
and then like it just loops around, and then the back is actually like on the back center

02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:56.880
by your bum.

02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:57.520
Did you see these?

02:20:57.520 --> 02:20:58.160
It'd be awesome.

02:20:58.160 --> 02:20:59.040
No, I didn't.

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:00.240
I'll link it in the chat room.

02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:01.200
All right.

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:04.800
Okay, there it is.

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:06.640
They're pretty epic.

02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:07.520
Let me look at that right now.

02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:11.760
This is at panic.com slash good slash Noby Noby dot PHP.

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:13.120
Free advertising for them.

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:13.600
Look at that.

02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:14.480
Oh wow, I see.

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:16.400
They're hilarious.

02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:19.120
They look like a giant scribble on a shirt.

02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:20.080
They're hilarious.

02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:24.800
Oh my god, it's like somebody just did a giant scribble on a shirt, and they're gonna make

02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:25.840
tons of money off of it.

02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.040
That's so not fair.

02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:27.680
But they're cute.

02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.080
They're very cute.

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:31.600
I do have to say, though, in terms of design, I actually like how the page is laid out.

02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:33.280
Yeah, I like the pink and black one.

02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:35.760
I'm talking about the background graphics.

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:36.320
That's cute.

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:37.200
It's actually really cute.

02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:37.920
Really good idea.

02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:38.320
There you go.

02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:40.160
All righty.

02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:41.680
Loki, do you have any more?

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:45.200
Uh, I think that's it for right now.

02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:46.720
Uh, let's see.

02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:51.840
Oh yes, I remember tiger hugging me this one at the beginning of the show and uh, got sidetracked.

02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:55.280
Uh, one of the quick thing you hear about a denial service attack.

02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:59.200
Apparently, those against Xbox Live, they've actually responded to what's been going on

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.000
about this.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:06.080
Uh, apparently, uh, these hackers were going in there and doing some type of weird denial

02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:07.200
of service attack.

02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:12.080
Um, and it would boot Xbox Live people off of the network, actually.

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:15.840
Uh, Microsoft has responded saying that basically you should contact your internet provider

02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.920
if this is happening to you.

02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:22.320
However, they are threatening to ban any hacker that gets involved in it.

02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:25.600
Uh, quote, this problem is not related to the Xbox Live service but to the player's

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:26.640
internet connection.

02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:30.160
The attacker could also attempt to disrupt other internet activities such as streaming

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.560
video or web browsing using the same tool.

02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:36.160
And uh, Microsoft just kind of wants to remind people that hey, Xbox Live is like any other

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.120
internet service.

02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:42.160
So somebody is attempting to uh, hack you in that regard or I guess more like spam you

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:44.160
I think would be a more appropriate term.

02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:47.840
Uh, it could affect Xbox Live just like it would affect anything else you do on the internet.

02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:48.640
So be warned.

02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:53.520
And uh, if you're doing that to people, unless they really deserve it, you're lame.

02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:56.480
If you're doing it to people just randomly, then you know, you're lame.

02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:59.680
But if you're doing it to people because they really deserve it, then okay.

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:01.600
But just be careful.

02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:04.320
Apparently they're doing it to people because they lose to them.

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:05.520
Oh, see that's lame.

02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:06.080
It's like, okay.

02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:06.720
Get over it.

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:07.440
You've lost.

02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:08.480
I don't, I don't like you.

02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:10.960
I'm going to DDoS you.

02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:12.000
QQ some more.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:12.960
Cry me a river.

02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:15.520
Yeah, die in a fire if that's you.

02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:18.160
I mean, it just, you know, why are you playing games online?

02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:21.840
If, if you can't handle losing, don't play games online.

02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:24.560
Why else do people play games to piss other people off?

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:28.400
I fucking hope like Seth for real comes into your house and beat you up.

02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:30.640
Like that's what I hope for those people.

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:32.560
All right.

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:35.760
If that's it for the last minute stories and let's go around and get everybody's final

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:38.720
thought for the evening, uh, and wrap up the show for tonight.

02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:40.960
We can get to the, uh, live after birth.

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:44.400
Uh, Drew, thank you for being here tonight.

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:47.520
I'm sorry you didn't get to say more on the show and happy Pi Day.

02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:48.320
Pi Day.

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:50.880
You guys brought pie and we'll probably enjoy it during the after birth.

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:54.000
Although I don't know if we have a lot of forks, but I can't have any, but you guys

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.040
can all have some.

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:58.000
It is episode three 14 or Pi Day.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:58.960
So happy Pi Day.

02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:00.800
Uh, Drew, any final thoughts?

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.320
Kim, thank you for being here and hope you feel better.

02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:06.880
Take drugs.

02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:07.840
All right.

02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:09.360
Lots of drugs.

02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:10.960
And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:13.520
I hope you guys enjoy the pie.

02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:14.160
All right.

02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.760
We do punch and pie.

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:18.640
I don't have punch, but I have apple juice, so it'd be juice and pie.

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.080
All right.

02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:22.400
Uh, Joe, thank you for being here.

02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:23.360
Dark Tetsuya.

02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:26.720
Thank you as always for your contributions to the website and a lot of folks don't know,

02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:29.120
but you actually contribute a lot of the stories to the show every week.

02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:30.320
So thank you for being here.

02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:30.880
Of course.

02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:32.480
And do you have any final thoughts?

02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.320
I hear you're popular on the internet.

02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:35.440
I'm popular on the internet.

02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:36.640
Yes, I am popular on the internet.

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:37.680
You bastard.

02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:38.080
All right.

02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:40.720
Uh, Loki, what's your final thought for tonight?

02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:46.000
Um, final thought is I need to play more Nobby Nobby voice.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.320
Now that I actually know what I'm supposed to be doing in it.

02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:55.280
Although why only complain that camera fucking sucks and no, we know we boy poop more.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.440
I do need to poop more in the parakeet.

02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:04.480
My has a space squirrel.

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.080
It's the best in the squirrel has little antennas with sparkles on it.

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:10.800
I mean, it's absolutely awesome.

02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:11.040
All right.

02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:13.840
My space squirrel, the miniature giant space camps.

02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:14.400
I demand.

02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:16.400
Namco makes space squirrel the game.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:19.920
My final thought is our headache, et cetera.

02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:25.760
And I'll probably get Nobby Nobby boy so I can poop, but flower fruity racing.

02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:26.800
Amazing.

02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:28.000
Dark Sakura.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.080
Last but not least your final thought.

02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:36.240
Um, no, no.

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:37.600
Is your final thought?

02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:38.320
No means no.

02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:39.600
All right.

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:43.280
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and listening to orange lounge radio.

02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:44.400
We really appreciate it.

02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:45.360
You know, it's true.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:50.160
This isn't just a line without, you know, you guys, uh, we wouldn't exist because it's

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:51.520
all about independent podcasts.

02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:54.400
So if you enjoy what you hear, all you have to do, help us spread the word.

02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:56.000
Tell two people about the show.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.600
Leave us a nice review on iTunes.

02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:58.320
Help us spread the word.

02:25:58.320 --> 02:25:59.200
That's all we ask.

02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:01.360
We don't put advertising in the show or any of that stuff.

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.560
We just give up our time on Sunday nights because we like it.

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:08.720
It's fun and we like attention and we like to be popular on the internet.

02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:09.200
Right, Joe.

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.920
All right, so that's it.

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:13.520
Thank you guys so much for listening to us tonight.

02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:14.240
Have a good one.

02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:16.720
And thanks for listening to orange lounge radio.

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:17.520
We'll see you next week.

02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:21.360
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:27.120
Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show.

02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:34.240
Visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time.

02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:39.200
The views and opinions expressed on orange lounge radio do not necessarily reflect those

02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:45.280
of the entire staff of orange lounge radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right

02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:45.840
anyway.

02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:47.360
See you next week.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:56.320
You know what?

02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:58.480
I'm going to do something we don't usually do in the afterbirth here.

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.920
I'm going to make an outbound call because I saw someone join chat and I want to talk

02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:02.080
to him.

02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:04.160
Maybe I'll leave this in the podcast for fun.

02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:09.200
Usually we do a little live only thing after the show and play some copyrighted music,

02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:10.960
but tonight we'll do something special.

02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:11.760
Hi, Rob.

02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:12.320
It's Rob.

02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:13.760
Hi.

02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:14.080
Hi.

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:14.560
How are you?

02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:16.720
A little bit surprised.

02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:18.960
This is the first time orange lounge radio has called me.

02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:22.240
Yes, it doesn't happen very often, but I saw you join chat.

02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:24.480
You had incredible timing and joining chat.

02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:26.480
And my first thought was, were your ears burning?

02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:27.920
Because we were just talking about you.

02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:32.640
No, actually, I just came in after a little bit of Street Fighter 4 and a little bit of

02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:33.200
homework.

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:36.800
Well, no, the reason why I ask and why I'm putting you on the spot a little bit is because

02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:40.480
some folks called in talking about their local Street Fighter 4 tournaments, and they were

02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:42.320
talking about how they got beat and all this stuff.

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:45.280
And then I thought, you know, I think Rob has a different story about how the Street

02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:46.480
Fighter 4 tournament went.

02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:50.160
So I actually want to call you and ask you, how did the Street Fighter 4 tournament go

02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:50.480
for you?

02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:52.560
I moved on to the second round.

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:55.120
I've got that little blue sheet that says KO first round.

02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:56.240
You get to go to the second round.

02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:57.520
So yay me.

02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:00.880
How does that, does that mean you won the store or did the top three get to go or what?

02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:04.000
Well, here's what happened.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.320
I actually made it to, I lost in the winner's bracket to the guy who eventually made it

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:09.840
to the, well, who eventually won it.

02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:14.880
Then I won the loser's bracket, faced him again in the grand final, so to speak, and

02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:15.680
lost to him again.

02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:17.680
And the sad thing is it won three rounds every time.

02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:19.360
Really close.

02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:21.760
We actually both played Ryu because we're both Ryu bitches that way.

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.040
And it was really, really a good match.

02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:26.000
And it could be on either way.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.360
And I screwed up a few times and he screwed up a few times, but I ended up losing to him

02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:30.240
twice, sadly.

02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:32.480
I was going to ask who your character of choice is.

02:28:32.480 --> 02:28:34.480
So it's Ryu is your, is your, is your guy?

02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:36.240
Uh, let me put it this way.

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.040
My aim screen name is Ryu Rob D. So yes.

02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:41.680
Very nice.

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:42.240
All right.

02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.440
See, I don't know what it is.

02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:45.280
Like I'm trying to feel out different characters.

02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:47.120
And like back in the day I used to be Chun Li.

02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:52.480
Like, you know, you know, I love Chun Li and that was the one I used to use all the time.

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:57.520
But now like the, I, after Super Street Fighter 2 and everything, I think I really like Fei

02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:00.160
Long, especially after playing him in Street Fighter 4.

02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:00.800
But here's the thing.

02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:07.040
I am so challenged by the controls in freaking, you know, the Xbox 360, cause it's really

02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:10.640
hard on that little D pad to do three fireballs all in a row.

02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:14.400
So I was going to actually ask you next, how do you get around the control issue or have

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:16.240
you stuck it out with the D pad?

02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:17.600
Did you have to use the D pad in the tournament?

02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:18.560
I stuck it out with the D pad.

02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:19.840
I'm really used to it at this point.

02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:24.480
And it really has calloused my thumb entirely, but I'm used to it at this point.

02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:25.920
So I can actually do pretty much anything.

02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:28.560
I can do even Zangief's Sweetie and Pilot Driver.

02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:28.800
Oh my.

02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:33.520
Quarter circle forward, the double quarter circle forward motions are still eluding me

02:29:33.520 --> 02:29:33.920
a little bit.

02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:38.880
At least when I'm doing the Shoryuken focus, attack, dash, cancel into the end of Ryu's

02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:39.520
Matsuha Doken.

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:43.840
Meaning I'm doing a forward quarter circle forward motion, hitting the medium punch and

02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:47.600
kick buttons together, hitting forward forward again to dash, and then two quarter circle

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:51.200
forwards and a punch, all while the opponent is flying up in the air and coming down.

02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:52.400
You just fucking lost me.

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:52.960
But that's all right.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:57.680
I'm assuming that's just massive death right there.

02:29:57.680 --> 02:30:01.600
Some type of massive death.

02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:02.000
All right.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:02.880
Well, hey, you know what?

02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:03.760
Congratulations to you.

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:04.560
That's pretty awesome.

02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:07.680
And I wanted to hear about the whole, how it went.

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:09.920
Because we had a couple of people calling in saying, yeah, I lost.

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.040
Yeah, I lost.

02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:12.400
So well, good luck around too.

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:14.560
Are you going to be able to make it out there for round two, you think?

02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:15.920
Probably.

02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:19.520
I have a couple of people saying that they'll actually drive me, which as a poor college

02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:22.240
student with no car is a good thing.

02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:26.160
Actually, the funniest story I heard about the tournament this weekend is this could

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:29.120
just be someone bullshitting on an internet message board.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:33.200
But supposedly someone was at a tournament, and he's like, oh, we're just in some small

02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:33.840
little town.

02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:34.640
This will be easy to win.

02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:37.840
And then all of a sudden they're like, OK, first round we've got Justin Wong.

02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:39.600
Can he come to station A?

02:30:40.160 --> 02:30:44.000
And if you don't know who he is, he's a famous Marvel versus Capcom 2 player.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.760
I think even I've heard that name.

02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:47.120
Even I've heard that name.

02:30:47.120 --> 02:30:47.680
They used to do it.

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:51.360
We used to have an arcade here in Folsom that did huge Capcom events.

02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:55.360
So we would kind of like we had a DDR tournament there years ago, and it was still open.

02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:56.640
So that is funny.

02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.920
Well, how unlucky do you have to be really?

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:01.040
How funny.

02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:04.560
Hey, one other question I want to ask you, since you're the best Street Fighter 4 player

02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:04.960
I know.

02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:07.600
Thank you.

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:09.680
We don't have a lot on the show.

02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:14.400
My question is, what are some tips for those of us that consistently get our ass kicked

02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:16.400
by Seth who suck at the game?

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:18.800
Any advice for us to get better?

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:22.720
Certainly stay out of throw range when he wakes up, because what he likes to do is do

02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:25.200
that stupid Shoryuken spinning pile driver move.

02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:28.160
So staying a couple steps away from him when he wakes up would help a lot.

02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:32.880
Really wait for him to make a move and then sweep him, because the computer is very vulnerable

02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:34.720
to that, especially on the easier difficulties.

02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:38.000
And really just use your safest moves against him.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.520
Any tips for online in the non-Seth type battles?

02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:46.640
Online, for the Ryu players, let them make mistakes, because they're usually aggressive

02:31:46.640 --> 02:31:50.640
and most of them can't even Shoryuken, so they're vulnerable to air attacks.

02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:55.680
Most of their game usually revolves around just trying to attack as much as possible,

02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:57.680
so a patient player can do a lot.

02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:00.800
Is Crimson Viper a cheap bitch, yes or no?

02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:03.520
No, she's only got one effective move.

02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:04.560
That stupid shock move.

02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:09.520
But sometimes when you're fighting her, at least when you're new, the fact that she's

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:13.200
the only character I can think of that can hit you instantly from so far away like that,

02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:17.520
like I was not used to seeing that in Street Fighter, so I thought that was a little cheap.

02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:19.040
But yeah, she's interesting.

02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:21.840
I like how she resembles Vanessa a lot from King of Fighters.

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:22.320
I have no idea.

02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:25.920
I'm telling you, does she not look like an SNK character?

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:28.000
We were talking about this at the beginning of the show.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.160
She absolutely does, especially since she's got the red hair, she's a special agent type

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:33.280
character, that sort of thing.

02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:35.200
It's funny for her, I think, but hey.

02:32:36.160 --> 02:32:36.800
All right.

02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:40.240
All right, well, Rob, we're going to let you go and get to the rest of our after show or

02:32:40.240 --> 02:32:41.920
actually close the podcast at this point.

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:44.880
So thank you very much for letting us harass you and surprising you with a phone call and

02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:46.240
telling us about your experience.

02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:46.960
Always a pleasure.

02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:47.920
Have a good night, guys.

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:48.480
Take care, Rob.

02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:52.880
All right, so now the podcast is really over.

02:32:52.880 --> 02:33:07.120
Good night.
