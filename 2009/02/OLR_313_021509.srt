A landmark Sony store says goodbye

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mario and Sonic get ported to the Winter Olympics

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And is Namco Bandai about to acquire D3?

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Rob Roberts

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And joining me every week here in the OLR Studios

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In Sacramento, California

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who's feeling a little bit under the weather apparently

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yep

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Actually, we're all under the weather

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's one thing, one kind of common theme

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've been pretty sick

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm above the weather

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I had, you're above

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm over it all

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm above the weather

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No one is above the law

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The weather is not the law

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The weather is chaos

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've been kind of sick the past few days

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I had a horrible Valentine's Day because of it

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And Loki's a little bit sick as well

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Say hello, Techmaster Loki

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Loki's always a little sick

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm a little sick and a little eating sandwich

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's right

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And then some of the folks on Justin TV are already commenting how messy the studio looks tonight

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, well that's what happens when you're sick

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You don't really feel like cleaning

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Plus, we're presented in widescreen tonight

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So you can see even more of the mess that is usually off screen

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was wondering why his lightbox is in there

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's that?

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I really didn't notice

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All the crap that's around?

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's not that bad

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This room has been way, way worse

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's usually not live during a show

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Anyhow

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Also joining us tonight, you know why he had so much freaking fun last week

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He decided to come back one more time for you kids

51
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Say hello to the one and only Dan the man

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hello

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How are you doing, Dan?

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Back for more

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Did you miss us that much?

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have no place else I'd rather be

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're lying

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your internet's out at home, isn't it?

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
True that

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Dan's internet's out at home

62
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, you know, he's here

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Probably back on by now

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But you're here

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Nice talking to you

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
With us

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah, there's storms going on out in California right now

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Which is, you know, for most of the rest of the world

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The storms here are actually pretty pitiful

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know, compared to the rain they get like back east and stuff

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But it's just not built out here to withstand some of the wind things we get

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So when we get it a little windy, internet goes down left and right

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's pretty sad

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
People forget how to drive and start ramming their car into things that we need

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Which I don't understand anyways how, you know, wind causes the internet to go down

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Since the cables are underground

79
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sometimes, I don't know, like ours

80
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Underground wind

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ours runs from the top

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's a big wire that comes down and it's weird

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It runs like next to the phone line

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Cable modems, son

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When they're underground, yet they still go up

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, whatever

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Anyhow, we're going to get started tonight talking a little bit about our gaming weeks

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And since I finally remembered the presence I got Dark Sakura like a month ago in Hawaii

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I finally am going to remember to give her tonight

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I'm going to go in the house and get those while Dark Sakura tells us about her gaming week, Dark Sakura

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I had a relatively busy gaming week despite school stuff

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We played, I started playing City of Heroes this morning just on the trial

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Started playing with Sauce

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And it was pretty fun

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You know, I picked an electric power user who was a pretty cool character

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And of course the most fun part is actually designing your character, making costumes and stuff

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So that was pretty cool

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I also finished, well I

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm trying to think, what all did we play last night on the Genesis Collection?

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Last night being Valentine's Day evening

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My husband and I decided to do something super romantic

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And we played Xbox all night after I got us a lovely dinner prepared at Whole Foods

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So we played a lot of Genesis Collection and some R-type dimensions

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And I played some Symphony of the Night

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And played a little, a couple of DS games but I don't remember what

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh yeah, I downloaded and installed Perfect World but I haven't started that yet

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So I'm thinking City of Heroes is going to be the game of choice

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I've heard some interesting things about City of Heroes

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think one of us OLR peeps needs to get on that

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That would be me

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Go for it

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is it in Tiara on City of Heroes? Or was that a while ago?

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We were playing together

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh okay, cool

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, we played together today

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Because I know the new website is launching very very soon

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And we're going to have Tiara hopefully doing some articles for us there

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That'd be good, that'd be good

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Not that I can think of

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Then how about presents?

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I like presents

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Alright, some presents

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm going to show this to JustinTV before I give it to Jamie here

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I got Jamie an authentic hula girl for her dashboard

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
To match the one that Loki had

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So that's from Hawaii

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Even though these presents are like a month old I'm just now remembering to give them to her

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And because I know Jamie's a tea drinker

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I got her different types of tea that are very Hawaii

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
One of them is a coconut macadamia herbal

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ooh, yum

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And the other one is pineapple Waikiki

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Dude, that's great, I love pineapple

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So there you go, some tropical teas there for a dark soccer

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I could totally use it because my voice is dying

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I know, I'm almost kind of wishing I brought some more home for me

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But that's okay, I have other stuff

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Loki, you already got your presents a few weeks ago

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So he doesn't feel left out

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But he got a matching hula girl

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Anyway, tell us about your gaming week, Loki

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You picked the perfect time when I have my mouth full of food

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Sorry, I have to go take these presents over to dark soccer

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Anyways, so I played lots of Grand Theft Auto IV

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And since it's actually working on the PC

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've been playing around with modding the different files and seeing what that does

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I've been playing with making different weapons

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I have the typical stuff, a weapon that has way too much physical power

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you shoot it into somebody and they bounce around like a ping pong ball

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Or the grenades that create an explosion that's so big that it covers a four block radius with fire

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And kind of blows everything apart

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And that's fun

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So I've been doing that

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And the game of course is very unstable when you do that, so it's been crashing a lot

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then just playing regular Grand Theft Auto IV on consoles

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Doing the deathmatch stuff there

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Actually thinking of picking up Lost and Damned this week

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Actually I'm in a couple of them so I can try the multiplayer in that

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And if that's really good then I may pick it up on all five consoles

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then that way we can play multiplayer in Lost and Damned

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then other stuff I've been playing, I played the Killzone 2 demo which is actually pretty good

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Very similar to Resistance as far as I'm concerned

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The game itself, not so much, not as hard as Gears of War of course

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Although the game itself, the AI is very intelligent it seems

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So I can't just easily kill them or just run up on them and stuff like that

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But it looks cool and I think it'll be very entertaining

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm not sure if I'm actually going to pick it up right away because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But maybe soon after

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Then the other game I played was Street Fighter IV

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I've been playing that quite a bit

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The game is actually quite easy to beat, obviously un-easiest

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Because I'm no good at the game at all

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So it was easy enough to beat on it, not as easy as some videos would make it seem

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can't just go high-kicking everything around

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because the AI is smart enough to know, hey I'm going to kick your ass now

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Because you're just doing the same move over and over and over again

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Some people it works like the women with the long legs of course

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It works pretty well but it's not just like you can put on auto-fire and leave the room

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They will kick your ass

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But the stories are kind of neat in there, like the little anime cutscenes that they have

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know, it's not really a game I'm into

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Just because it's a fighting game

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Actually Tatsunoko vs Capcom was kind of entertaining for me

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I like the little theme song though that's in there, it's kind of cheesy

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the voice acting, I like what's kind of cool about that is

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
After you beat the game the first time through you get an option to toggle the Japanese or English voices per character

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hallelujah

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So if you like some of the English dubbing then you can go ahead and leave it English

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or you can just switch it to Japanese per character

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So that's pretty awesome

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That also has cutscenes and all the other stuff too

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So I thought that was really cool

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And then other than that, it's just kind of fun

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I was playing with some of the new characters, Rufus is kind of funny

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then El Fuerto is pretty cool

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Repeat what your wife said about Rufus because that made me laugh

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes I was playing as Rufus and then Nellie's like

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That looks like me but with blonde hair

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm like come on, that is ridiculous

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Rufus is the big guy right?

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah he's the one that has his belly flap physics

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Nellie is one of the tiniest people I've ever met

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Her beard also totally isn't that impressive

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
She was talking about herself

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No Rufus is like me if I were to be in a fighting game pretty much

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What I want to see now, I want to see Rufus versus

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Ok I'm going to go way back here everybody, ready?

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Raiden from Fatal Fury, that's what I want to see

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I want to see that fight

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Just got to wait for the next round of crossover

213
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Or Chang from Fatal Fury 2

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
From Art of Fighting

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh and Seth is a bitch

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Seth the final boss who has moves from all the other Street Fighter characters

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He sucks, even on Easy as he's fucking cheap

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's get some comments from our chat room

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
chat.orangelandrated.com

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Chat is pointing out you sound different tonight

221
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
VSTRNSV says Loki sounds weird

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Tigerclaw says you sound slightly deeper

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's because I'm congested

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He's been sick too, like all of us

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Literally every host in the L.R. is sick tonight

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's my sexy voice

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's ok, I feel ok

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Just in time for Valentine's Day

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Loki wants you to get down this week

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
With Street Fighter IV

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm gonna stab women on the

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm waiting by their phones for your call

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Some comments from chat

234
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Leo Shen wants to know how's Crimson Viper

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Pretty good, I like her a lot better than like say

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You know, Chung Li

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Some of her moves are interesting

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You know this is, you're asking the person's opinion

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Who doesn't play this game, I mean hardly ever

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I played through her once

241
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
How did the tits compare to Ivy?

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's what guys really want to know

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know, ok, here's the weirdest thing

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Which fighting game has the best tits?

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Dead or Alive, Soul Calibur, or Street Fighter IV?

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Dead or Alive, by far

247
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Soul Calibur

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And then we'll go to, you know, Street Fighter

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Because Street Fighter, they don't really seem to have any boot physics

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Although, I swear to god, I saw this during like

251
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
A little in-game cutscene

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Because there's a point where you have to fight your rival

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's the second to last character you fight before Seth

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And, I swear to god, she was walking away and she turned

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And her boobs snapped

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Like, it was like, they got stuck in some place and all of a sudden it's like

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Wham! And like went back

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It just like threw me off

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because she isn't, they don't like move when you're actually fighting

260
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know, it's not, the only person that has any sort of physics like that

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or, that's Rufus, you know, with his big flap

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But, um, so Rufus has booby physics

263
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Rufus has booby physics

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's, no, it's like gut physics

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know

266
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But, um, yeah, it's okay

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I mean, like I said, I'm no good at Street Fighter

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And, you know, I don't pretend to be, you know, winning any arcade game

270
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I mean, hell, I lose to the computer on easiest sometimes

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So, that's pretty bad

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You just need to do what I do at Chun Li and just hit the kick button repeatedly

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It doesn't work

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Even on easiest that the like computer would be just like

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, you stop doing stuff, I'm gonna walk over and punch you now

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, they're actually, it's pretty hard

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't know if it ramps up based on how well you're doing

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But, you know, easiest isn't the cakewalk that I thought it should be

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

280
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Every time I hear the word Rufus, the first thing on my mind is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was thinking Rufus Shinra, but I was, I watched that pretty recently

282
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Alright

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Um, okay, so if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then I'll talk about mine

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mine was pretty much the same as Jamie's

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I played a lot of the new Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Except I played it for the Playstation 3

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Um, they didn't have it on 360 when I went

289
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I actually was thinking, you know what

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
For the classic games, I think I'll want the D-pad on the Playstation 3 controller

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And why not, I don't have a lot of games that offer trophies

292
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So if I feel like being an achievement whore on the PS3, why not, it makes sense

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So I picked it up

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And I'm pretty sure I'm getting the exact same freaking thing on the Playstation 3

295
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That 360 users are getting, it's really not a big difference at all

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Um, but overall the game collection is pretty awesome

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I mean, you cannot beat the value

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's $40 for, what, no sorry

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
40 games for $30 and then like 9 unlockables in there

300
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And some of the unlockables are pretty awesome

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You get some arcade games like Altered Beast, Fantasy Zone, Shinobi

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Which was awesome, and Dan had pointed out a fact I didn't think of before the show

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But they have never released an official port of Shinobi Arcade for the home systems

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I mean, you had the dumbed down

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There have been lots of Shinobi ports, but you never see them on these collections

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And not the authentic arcade version, like a lot of them were dumbed down for the 8-bit systems

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like they had Shinobi on the NES from Tengen if I remember right

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But it was pretty dumbed down, you know

309
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It was different, at least they did

310
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They tried to at least emulate the actual arcade version unlike

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you remember like Ninja Gaiden on the NES was completely different from Ninja Gaiden Arcade

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But for the better in that case

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Way better

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Way better

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Anyhow, random tangent

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But I just remember being a kid like it was Shinobi over here and Ninja Gaiden over here

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Like the two big Ninja games he had

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So, anyhow

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The collection is great, it's definitely worth the money

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A slight disappointment that they didn't do more with the online functionality

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Especially when they've had us buy this collection before on the GameCube

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And these collection, you know, or I shouldn't say the same collection

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But you know, Sonic games at least all bundled together and so on

324
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Little disappointed that they didn't do at least leaderboards, online multiplayer

325
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Something that brought in the extra functionality

326
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Who knows, downloadable games

327
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why not, I mean we all noticed Revenge of Shinobi was missing from the collection

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And some other big Genesis titles from back in the day are missing completely

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So why not have these as like download content

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That would be actually kind of rad

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I, but I somehow doubt that's how they're going to do it

332
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why should they?

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They released Sonic 1 and they released

334
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Didn't the original Streets of Rage come out for download 360

335
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And one of the Sonic 2 was download content for Xbox Live Arcade

336
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Streets of Rage 2 dead

337
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, Streets of Rage 2, not 1

338
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Way better

339
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, so

340
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, but wouldn't it be cool if they perfected their Genesis emulator with this game

341
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And then it's like virtual console but with all Genesis games on the 360

342
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's really interesting about this that you say virtual console

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because like seriously, if you own a Wii and a 360

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Or a Wii and a PS3

345
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Like this game invalidates the need for like almost all those Genesis games on virtual console

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That you would have paid what 8 dollars times 40 is what 320 dollars for

347
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Again for a tenth of that, not even

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's just amazing

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So I don't know

350
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I mean some could claim it's not 100% authentic

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But at the same time I think it's really as close as you're going to get

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Short of bringing out the old Genesis system

353
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And blowing off the dust and hooking it up and plugging it in

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You know what I mean

355
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't see it ever getting any closer

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So there it is

357
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's the reason to have a CDX though

358
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For more games?

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Because there's no CD games in this

360
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No Sewer Shark

361
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's just small and easy

362
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Or Nomad, you know

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Gotcha

364
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Maybe that's the next Sonic's Ultimate CDX collection

365
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And we'll have freaking Night Trap

366
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You really want to play the Dana Plato game?

367
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't know why I want to play the Dana Plato game but I do

368
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There's microcosm in Sewer Shark

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Microcosm I actually liked

370
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There was Dragon's Lair

371
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where's my Jaguar collection?

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Where it should be non-existent

373
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It would just be Tempest 2000

374
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It would just be Tempest 2000

375
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's pretty much it

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think there's one other good Jaguar game I can't think of right now

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Defender?

378
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Going to comments from chat

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Acidic Vampire says they need some tougher achievements in that collection

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah the achievements are a little easy

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But again that's why online leaderboard at least would have been cooler

382
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So you have something else to obtain

383
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah the achievements are a little easy

384
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They're a little on the easy side

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Some of them will take you a little bit of determination to get

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah it was on the easy side

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Same thing with the trophies

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The trophies and achievements are the same thing

389
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's just that on the Playstation instead of worth points

390
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They're worth either bronze, silver, or gold depending on what it is

391
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But I unlocked a gold trophy easy

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I got the Sonic Spinball

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No maybe it's just because I love Sonic Spinball

394
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
For whatever reason don't laugh

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But I got 10 million points on stage one that's all you have to do

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And that's like beating stage one pretty much

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This is probably unlikely but can you combine games together

398
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like you know with Sonic Spinball and all the Sonic games

399
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can do the Sonic and Knuckles stuff

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Sadly no

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And actually you couldn't do that with Sonic Spinball I don't believe

402
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah you can

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You could play as Knuckles

404
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No you couldn't

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You could do Blue Sphere

406
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah there was something I think like one little extra thing it gave you

407
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No you could play as Knuckles in Spinball

408
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

409
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't think you can

410
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I thought you could

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You think you thought wrong

412
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
My Genesis collection which I mean is not a CD for my Xbox

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But it's a box full of Genesis crap

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's sitting by my TV

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
If you want to come on by we'll walk on

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But you get something with it

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You get something you get the blue

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Just like all the other games it does the Blue Sphere game

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Not even the complete one I think it's only with Sonic the Hedgehog

420
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah it's kind of dumb

421
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But interesting

422
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's see I'm still looking at comments in the chatroom

423
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
GameGuru says it was Sonic 2 that gave you Knuckles

424
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Some of them gave you the extra character

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Alright I guess that's it for gaming week

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Unless Dan I don't know if you played some stuff that Jamie didn't

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That you want to share with us but Dan do you have anything?

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I've played nothing new this week

429
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Nothing new

430
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm still playing HD Remix

431
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I played R-Type Dimensions

432
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And I played Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection

433
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
For Shinobi mostly

434
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There you go

435
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And here's what I have to say

436
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Online leaderboards suck

437
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't know why you like them

438
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
All they do is serve to remind me

439
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That the games that I think that I'm good at

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I really really suck at

441
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But it gives you something to work towards

442
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
All I know is go to the online leaderboards for R-Type Dimensions

443
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And see the people who have beaten that game without dying

444
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Every one of those people I want to kick in the balls

445
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I thought I was good at R-Type I am no good at R-Type

446
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I hate you all

447
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There was some game it was the Midway Collection I think

448
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
One of the first that came out and it had online leaderboards

449
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And like for a while I was in the top 10 for Wizard of War

450
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That old ass 80's game and that made me feel pretty cool

451
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Even though like nobody probably fucking played Wizard of War

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I dominated Roadblasters on that

453
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And the Xbox for months

454
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
See they can be fun

455
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But you know what eventually somebody owned me

456
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And that person when I find you

457
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I wish I remembered your gamer name

458
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I will kill you

459
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Rob you did though play Streets of Rage right?

460
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah

461
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You did listen to the pretty cool soundtrack

462
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yuzo Koshiro absolutely

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That was like my whole incentive for playing Streets of Rage

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Because I don't know I'm kind of sick of those side scrolling

465
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I had forgotten that you did it

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Oh yeah you can tell too

467
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's very

468
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's all about playing Blaze in that game though because you guys suck

469
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Nice

470
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Nice

471
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Alright let's get into some housekeeping real quick

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
There's a couple things on the table right now tonight

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If you are listening to us live on AllGames.com or on Justin TV

474
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello by the way again to the Justin TV listeners

475
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You can look at us on camera at Justin TV

476
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know why you'll want to watch a radio show

477
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But that's what the listeners ask for so we gave it to them

478
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Keep in mind we still don't have our issue fixed

479
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Where you can hear all the sound that goes out over air

480
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So you only hear what goes through the microphones

481
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You don't hear any of the music

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I forgot to bring the adapter for that

483
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's not a huge deal

484
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I would hope that everybody is still at AllGames.com to get the full experience

485
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But I know there's some people that because of firewalls and stuff

486
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
They can't so they have Justin TV

487
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Which seems very odd to me that you would be able to watch Justin TV

488
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But not all, whatever

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Some people have claimed that happens so it's interesting

490
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But that's interesting

491
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The only other thing I want to say is that by the way

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Speaking of Justin TV stay tuned tonight on Justin TV

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Because we have something special after the show for you live folks

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And if you're listening live tonight

495
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
OrangeLaunchRadio.com is down

496
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's not there

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's a big black screen with a Moblin that says it's a secret to everyone

498
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Something is in the works

499
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And if you've been listening to the show for the past couple of weeks

500
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You know darn well what's coming

501
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's going to happen live tonight during the show a little later on

502
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
They're just crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's right now

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
While we're taping

504
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So in the meantime you can still join us at chat

505
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There is still a link on OrangeLaunchRadio.com to go to our chat room

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That is not being affected by the side outage

507
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Just check out OrangeLaunchRadio.com

508
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Some folks in chat sharing their online leaderboard experiences

509
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
ActDeaf says I was at one point in the top 20 users in championship mode of Pac-Man CE

510
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's a tough one

511
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That is an achievement

512
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That is an achievement

513
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Achievement unlocked

514
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That is, you have a big EP for that one

515
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because that is not an easy game to be doing that with

516
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So, alright

517
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news

518
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And all that

519
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And talk about what's new in the gaming world this week

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Are you done with your sandwich, Lowkey?

521
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No, I'm not done with my sandwich, but that's okay

522
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Alright, we'll make it work anyway

523
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The show must go on

524
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The show must go on

525
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
With or without sandwich

526
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, let me say this real quick

527
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I am going to give a quick shout out to our buddy Brad from Pod Culture

528
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He started a new podcast for that show Dollhouse

529
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I meant to watch that

530
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I did watch it

531
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I did watch it

532
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Because Joss is the man

533
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Hopefully he has more listeners than there were viewers for the Dollhouse

534
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, did it not do well on the ratings?

535
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No, it lost to Supernanny and I will have to say

536
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I was part of the Supernanny crowd, unfortunately

537
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You know what, the whole...

538
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Rude

539
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
They just can't screw this up the way they did Firefly

540
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hopefully it will make up some listeners on like

541
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Or, you know, with, not listeners

542
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Viewers from like TiVo and iTunes and all that stuff right now

543
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's just on a bad night

544
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I mean, most people don't stay home and watch TV on Fridays

545
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The whole problem is that they screwed up Firefly so bad

546
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That people are going to have a bad impression

547
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Those who never went back to watch the DVDs

548
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I mean, Joss is the man

549
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean, I'm serious

550
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you put this show on any other day in the week

551
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I think you'll be fine

552
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Seriously

553
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Fox does have this tendency to give Joss Whedon the death spot

554
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I mean, Friday nights

555
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I mean, not to knock Fringe because I love Fringe

556
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But if you want this show

557
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If it's kind of tanking for you guys

558
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Why don't you just throw, you know, Dollhouse right after American Idol

559
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I mean, then that way you get a really big lead in

560
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Hopefully they will one night

561
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They'll give it a shot after American Idol

562
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't know, because the show is pretty decent

563
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Look, let me put it this way

564
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I know I'm like the gay guy you hear on the podcast or whatever

565
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
But seriously, like, if I was straight

566
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Elijah Dushku

567
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You betcha

568
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You betcha

569
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
She is pretty hot

570
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
She's very hot

571
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, that's happening for real

572
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So anyway, I didn't give the website

573
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Support our buddy Brad's podcast

574
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's thedollhousepodcast.com

575
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
If you're a Whedon fan

576
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You should check that out and support that show

577
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But Joss is owned

578
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Buffy just doesn't strike twice

579
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
He hit too big too soon

580
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's all downhill from there

581
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Well, you know

582
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Firefly was awesome

583
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Ten times better than Buffy

584
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And it got screwed off of TV

585
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So I don't see what the fans are hoping for

586
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Brad's actually saying in chat

587
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We started a Deadpool on pod culture

588
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
About how long it'll take Fox to axe it

589
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That's pretty morbid, but sad, but true

590
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I know there had been talk about them actually

591
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Doing a Faith spinoff

592
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But this was a different idea

593
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And I think that it was that he and Elijah Dushku

594
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Came up with the idea together, so

595
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Honestly, the show's not bad

596
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It was a little hard to get into

597
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Because I think the first episode kind of hits the ground running

598
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But it's not bad by any means

599
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Mark, put it on sci-fi

600
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I mean, shit

601
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
They just got, you know, what?

602
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Reruns of, you know

603
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Some Stargate spinoff

604
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I mean, seriously, just put it on there

605
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah, but Stargate Atlantis was crap

606
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Alright, look, we gotta get into gaming news

607
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
We suddenly have turned into the nerdy podcast

608
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Sorry

609
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We don't want to infringe on pod culture's territory

610
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Rock turned into?

611
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Excuse me, what?

612
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Turned into?

613
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You know what I mean, alright

614
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I watch a lot of TV during the week, okay?

615
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's true

616
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Ever since I stopped playing WoW

617
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I have watched a shitload more TV than I used to

618
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I would never have watched All House

619
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Before it used to be, okay

620
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
House and NipTuck or whatever

621
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Now it's like

622
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Like, eight shows I'm watching

623
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's like, too much

624
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But anyways

625
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Amazing Grace starts tonight

626
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
One show, one show

627
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
TiVo it, don't

628
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Supernatural

629
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I watched Wife Swap last week

630
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's how pathetic I was

631
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Not Supernanny, but what?

632
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I actually watched Wife Swap then Dollhouse

633
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
We don't, like, watch Supernanny religiously

634
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's just, if it's on, it's like

635
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay, so

636
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Rob, got more news for us

637
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Loki wants to start us off with a story tonight

638
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Alright, well

639
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You know, after all the assumptions that

640
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The viral video wasn't necessarily a viral video

641
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And it was, you know

642
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Or it was a viral video, but just not leaked out

643
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Um, yeah

644
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Apparently that video that was out last week

645
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know, showing zombies

646
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
In, like, a Las Vegas type of

647
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You know, setting with

648
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You know, a giant atmosphere and stuff like that

649
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yes, that was actually

650
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Dead Rising 2

651
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And Capcom did announce Dead Rising 2

652
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Which will be coming out on PC, 360, and PS3

653
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It will take place

654
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
In a brand new

655
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
City

656
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Fortune City

657
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's kind of like Las Vegas

658
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And it will be a gambling paradise

659
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
No longer will you be playing Frank West

660
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But some guy in a jacket

661
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And there's, um

662
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Boo to that, I'm sorry, Frank West is awesome

663
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay

664
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
But they've got, you know, different pictures

665
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You know, they have everything from

666
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Him beating up zombies with a giant cell phone

667
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
To a dirt bike

668
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
To a roulette wheel, so, um

669
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But has he covered wars?

670
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Maybe

671
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
But see, here's the thing, though, maybe

672
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
We're only talking, like, four screenshots

673
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And everyone's assuming that Frank West is not there

674
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Maybe Frank West is there

675
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
But maybe there's two player co-op

676
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Maybe it's multiple characters

677
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Maybe he's a zombie

678
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And he's like the super zombie

679
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And you have to run over him with a riding lawn mower

680
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't know

681
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But, hey, you know, it looks pretty awesome so far

682
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So, um, I'm sure we'll hear more about this

683
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
During E3

684
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I need to go back and play more Dead Rising

685
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Because I had the first one, and that game is just fun

686
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
To just fuck around with

687
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Well, you can not do a lot of anything

688
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Play the sub-par Dead Rising chop till you drive

689
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
No, I can't, because I just will not be able to put up with that

690
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
After playing the 360 version

691
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But they have new costumes

692
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The entire fun of the 360 version

693
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Is taking pictures while you're doing these horrible

694
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Things to the zombies

695
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
They took that out of the Wii version, I'm sorry

696
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But I would watch that for two player co-op

697
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Same screen or something, I don't know

698
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Talking about TV shows

699
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
In the chat room

700
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And video game potential

701
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Acidic Vampire suggests Supernanny the game

702
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't know, I get the sense that would just be Imagine Babies

703
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Or something like that

704
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What the hell is Supernanny?

705
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's this show where

706
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They call the 800 number

707
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The producers of the show

708
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
If their kids are just out of control

709
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You should watch this show because it would piss you off

710
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Are they Poppins modern day?

711
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes, actually the lady

712
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Her name is Joanne or something, she's from Britain

713
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
So she has the accent and everything

714
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
She even carries a little umbrella

715
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And she comes and she restores harmony

716
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
To the household

717
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You know how to restore harmony to a household with unruly children?

718
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
What?

719
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Duct tape, ceiling

720
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Basically this last episode that I missed Dollhouse for

721
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It had this guy

722
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
This abusive dad who's like

723
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Slapping his kids and stuff

724
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You can't slap the baby

725
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That's not the way to raise your baby

726
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And it's like an hour of that

727
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You cannot slap your baby

728
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm so glad

729
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't watch that show because it sounds retarded

730
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It's just frustrating

731
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And you know the thing that pisses me off the most, Rob

732
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Is watching people be stupid

733
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That's why I like

734
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I think your own personal hell would be shows

735
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Like you'd be strapped to a chair

736
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Forced to watch this and Wife Swap

737
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And I don't know, some of these

738
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Feel good reality shows

739
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Feel good my ass, watching people be stupid

740
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Is the worst form of torture ever

741
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Do you know what I like to do?

742
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I like to watch The Biggest Loser while eating

743
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh my god, now that would be crazy

744
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This food is so tasty and you can't have any

745
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's all mine

746
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's my chocolate

747
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I ate an entire cup of

748
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Low fat ice cream

749
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Just for a medical thing I do low fat

750
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
An entire cup of low fat ice cream

751
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Which I know makes a lot of sense

752
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It's not really low fat when you eat the whole fucking cup

753
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You're holding it out and going

754
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh don't you want some?

755
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's full of sugar

756
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Sugary goodness

757
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It is, anyway

758
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm sorry, we need to get back to gaming news

759
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Can we please?

760
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
One place I will not be eating ice cream ever again at

761
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Is the Metreon

762
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And we know the Metreon here at Orange Launch Radio

763
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
We actually have a lot of very fond memories of the Metreon

764
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I have no memories of the Metreon

765
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Other than it used to exist because I've never been to the Metreon

766
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Hold on, let me say it

767
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The Metreon is not closing

768
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But the Metreon has gone through a lot of changes in the past few years

769
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
For one, it's not owned by Sony anymore

770
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And the reason why I say the Metreon holds a special place in our hearts

771
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The very first Dance Dance Revolution tournament

772
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If you've been listening to this show for any length of time

773
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You know Dark Soccer, Loki, and myself

774
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We all met playing DDR at the arcade

775
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The first Dance Dance Revolution tournament I ever went to was at the Metreon

776
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And do you remember that the Metreon

777
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We went to the Metreon the day we decided to do the radio show

778
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We came up with the name and everything

779
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
OLR was born on a trip to the Metreon

780
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The third mix that was half-faded

781
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
The fifth mix that was half-faded

782
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yep, I remember that

783
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
At that cool little arcade

784
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And that was when they had the little oops I went to hell store

785
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Or whatever that chick was

786
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Oh, I can't remember the name

787
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Oops I went to hell store

788
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
No, the chick was on all these shirts

789
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That say oops I just ran over or something

790
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Or oops I had sex with your boyfriend

791
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That was like the little niche on all these shirts

792
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And I just remember getting one that said oops I went to hell

793
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh

794
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't remember the name of the character

795
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It wasn't an Emily

796
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I don't think so, I don't know, anyway forget it

797
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But I've seen Nightmare Before Christmas there twice

798
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah, they have the IMAX theater and everything

799
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well now it's owned by Westfield

800
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
That happened a couple years ago

801
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It got changed over, but here's the thing is that they still have the Sony store

802
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Well, guess what

803
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Apparently in an interview with GameSpot

804
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Sony has said the lease for the Metreon

805
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
For the Playstation store will expire this summer

806
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We have chosen not to renew it

807
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
They are saying the lease expires on March 31st

808
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So the Sony store is going to be closing

809
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It's kind of sad in a way

810
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I mean it is and it isn't

811
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I mean the Sony store was a little you know

812
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
A little overpriced and glamorous

813
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean well they charge

814
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
They charge the same price you pay in any store

815
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But they didn't really have sales

816
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Or anything like that going on there

817
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Everything was very high end or whatever

818
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It was very nice

819
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But it was still kind of nice that Sony had an official place

820
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You know what I mean?

821
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And they did all their launch parties there

822
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
There were some Final Fantasy things that went on there

823
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's kind of sad

824
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It is the end of an era in a way

825
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Anyhow

826
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
By the way speaking of the launch parties

827
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Sony has apparently said

828
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
They are still always looking at new avenues

829
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
For additional retail exposure in space

830
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But they felt it best not to continue with a dedicated

831
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Playstation store at the Metreon at this time

832
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Again if you haven't caught on yet

833
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The Metreon

834
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Is right off of 4th street in San Francisco

835
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Gonna be closing

836
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The Sony store is closing

837
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Not the whole thing

838
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There are a couple of other notable things about the Metreon

839
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Apart from having a pretty decent arcade there

840
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Is there is the

841
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Video game

842
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Walk of Fame

843
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I don't know if they still have that

844
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I thought it was still there

845
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I don't remember

846
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I thought it might have changed hands when it went to Westfield

847
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But I'm not sure

848
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's been there since it changed hands

849
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Was it? Okay

850
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I haven't been since it was Sony

851
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's been a couple of years since I've been

852
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And it was still Sony last time I went

853
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I went not too long ago

854
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You could tell the place was hurting

855
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Because this was right when the first arcade they had closed

856
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It was empty

857
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It was hurting

858
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean this was a couple of years ago

859
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Before everybody said the economy was going to crap

860
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And now just double that with

861
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
A bummer

862
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
There's not much good news left anyway

863
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You know in other

864
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Square related news

865
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The Squenix boss

866
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Yoichi Wada

867
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Said that

868
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Dragon Quest 10

869
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Since it's being delayed it would cause problems

870
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
For the release of Final Fantasy 13

871
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Well

872
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's just that they can't

873
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Really be sure

874
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
If it's going to affect it or not

875
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But Dragon Quest 9

876
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Is going to be

877
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Delayed from March to July

878
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And they don't know if that's going to cause

879
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Final Fantasy 13 to get pushed back

880
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's actually supposed to be out

881
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
In Japan this year

882
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And

883
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Over here and in Europe

884
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Next year sometime around

885
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
April 2010

886
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It was also reported that

887
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
3D Realms mentioned that the

888
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Delay on Dragon Quest

889
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
10 also

890
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Is going to be delaying Duke Nukem forever

891
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Oh gee

892
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Even though the games have nothing in common

893
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Hey

894
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's very much in common both are going

895
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Through delays

896
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But there is though a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy 13

897
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Out so look for it

898
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Another new one or is this the same one

899
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That was out a couple weeks ago

900
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I think it's the one that's been out for a couple weeks

901
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The one that shows some of the battle and CGI

902
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah

903
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Boy oh boy

904
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So Final Fantasy 13 needed another delay

905
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The slimes Rob, slimes

906
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Well at this point though

907
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm just kind of used to it

908
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Final Fantasy 13 it will be out when it's out

909
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I take it back I don't think it's Dragon Quest 9

910
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Or Dragon Quest 10

911
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's 9

912
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Oh I said 10

913
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Never mind

914
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Dragon Quest 10 will be delayed until 2012

915
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm sure 10 is also delayed

916
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm sure 10 will be out eventually

917
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So therefore they can't start working on 10

918
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That makes sense to me

919
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I bet you anything 10 is on the Wii

920
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Or whatever it may be Nintendo's next system

921
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because the last Dragon Quest game that they had on the Wii

922
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Was so awesome

923
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm just saying

924
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They'll go for wherever the big market is

925
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
We'll see

926
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Well then the next Dragon Quest game

927
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Would be in my pants

928
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
The biggest market out there

929
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh shush

930
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't want to know about that because of slimes

931
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah

932
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Because Activision

933
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Has talked about their

934
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
2009 lineup

935
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It probably will surprise you that there is

936
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 coming out this year

937
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I know shocking

938
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Seeing as that was pretty much

939
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Going to come out this year anyways

940
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And then apparently

941
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There's some sort of

942
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Racing game that Bazaar is

943
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Working on

944
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Some unannounced racing game

945
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That's kind of Mario Kart meets Forza

946
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Which that'd be kind of cool

947
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And then of course

948
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Prototypes sometime this year

949
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Probably around June

950
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
And you better believe

951
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That there's probably going to be tons of freaking

952
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Guitar Hero games

953
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Because they already said there's going to be a ton

954
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah there probably will be a ton

955
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I don't think they're going to renege on that

956
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Hmm

957
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But only

958
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Half the company is going to E3 right?

959
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yes

960
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
There's no Blizzard in this

961
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Activision Blizzard

962
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Which doesn't make any sense to me because you can't

963
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You're one company you can't have half your company not go

964
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
No they can get away with it because everybody

965
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Knows about Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2

966
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Which is we all know what Blizzard will be showing

967
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So what the hell

968
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Nobody wants to see those

969
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Well they know everybody already knows about it

970
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Everybody wants to see Guitar Hero greatest hits

971
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Or how to run a franchise

972
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Into the ground without ever even really trying

973
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well I think the reason why they're probably

974
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Not going to be obviously going to E3 is

975
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because then if they show all this stuff off

976
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
All their big announcements for Blizzcon

977
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Will be ruined

978
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Because they're going to PAX

979
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
No they're going to Blizzcon

980
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And seriously if they show it at E3 it has to come out

981
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You know like Starcraft Ghost

982
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm

983
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm looking at some comments from chatroom

984
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Tigerclaw says

985
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Tigerclaw is talking about the whole Dragon Quest thing

986
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah because Dragon Quest made you just in my pants

987
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
A little reference to the Saturday Night Live sketch

988
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Get it?

989
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Your album just came out

990
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm on a boat

991
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Can you imagine though if Dragon Quest X really was in Loki's pants

992
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
A wild schlong approaches

993
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
A wild schlong approaches

994
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
A wild schlong approaches

995
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
A wild schlong approaches

996
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Just in my pants

997
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Alright

998
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm selecting run

999
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Well something

1000
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Something that has run away

1001
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Far far away is the release date

1002
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Guild Wars 2

1003
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Sad

1004
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I know Guild Wars 2 originally was supposed to be out

1005
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Like in 2008 remember that

1006
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Like it was supposed to be out in 2008

1007
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I remember 2008 like it was last year

1008
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Yes it was

1009
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And then it got pushed back

1010
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And now it's been pushed back

1011
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
2010 to 2011

1012
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Is the new time frame for when Guild Wars 2

1013
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Is supposed to be out if you can believe it

1014
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's a huge release window

1015
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm assuming that sometime in the fiscal year

1016
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Let's wait until people you know have jobs

1017
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Or forgot what Guild Wars 2

1018
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Is about I don't know

1019
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I got devastated on Kotaku for saying it

1020
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Doesn't matter

1021
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Nobody buys Guild Wars

1022
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The people who play Guild Wars care

1023
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Nobody new is playing it so

1024
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's not wow so nobody cares

1025
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
The people playing Guild Wars

1026
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Are the people that bought it way back when it came out

1027
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So they didn't have to pay the monthly fee

1028
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And they're still playing it after all this time

1029
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But I think their new subtitle

1030
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Or not Gears of War

1031
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Guild Wars 2 will actually

1032
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Improve you know their

1033
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Client base

1034
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Guild Wars 2 now with rampant nudity

1035
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Ooh naked

1036
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Big booby adventure

1037
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Well how about

1038
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
How about something a little bit different

1039
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I just want to say real quick though the delay

1040
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Possibly because of the layoffs that NCSoft

1041
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Has just had and to note

1042
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
They're also skipping E3 this year

1043
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
NCSoft kind of has some issues going on anyway

1044
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Going out of business

1045
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Let's hope not because there's a lot of

1046
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Guild Wars fans will be very upset

1047
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Just as long as if they go out of business

1048
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Not a lot of Guild Wars fans

1049
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The standalone

1050
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
City of Heroes player creator

1051
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
For all the updated outfits

1052
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And stuff

1053
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I just want to say though like at PAX

1054
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I remember we were live one night remember how we did the whole

1055
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
All games thing live at PAX and we were all at the table

1056
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm sorry Rob I don't remember that

1057
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Going through the memory banks and find it because I remember

1058
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
One night we were sitting at the table

1059
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And there was a line coming out the door

1060
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
For the panel and one of them

1061
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Had to do a Guild Wars I remember

1062
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I distinctly remember it was a Guild Wars panel because I think we were making

1063
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Fun of Guild Wars a little bit while all the people were in line

1064
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And getting scow that

1065
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But of course every panel at PAX had a line

1066
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Going out the door and around and down the stairs

1067
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So we had like captive audiences

1068
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
The piracy one was hilarious

1069
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Anyhow sorry

1070
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I almost pirated the game during the piracy panel

1071
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I remember Loki trying to do that

1072
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
He was trying to pirate a game during the piracy panel

1073
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Just to be ironic

1074
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You're such an ass Loki

1075
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So

1076
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Jackassery

1077
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So how about

1078
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
People who are Warhammer 40k

1079
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Fans which is not

1080
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Me because I get tired

1081
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Of the stupid little figures

1082
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm sorry I had a bad

1083
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
For our listeners who don't know I had a bad

1084
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Experience with an ex who was addicted to Warhammer

1085
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
40k and his stupid retarded little

1086
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Lead figures and having to paint them

1087
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But I'm not bitter

1088
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
My sister's ex actually is really into Warhammer

1089
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
40k and he does paint the figures

1090
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
And he also

1091
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Larks and also

1092
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Plays Vampire the Masquerade

1093
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I LARPed but then I grew up

1094
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I just want to point out on wife swap

1095
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
This week it was a LARPer

1096
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
No

1097
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
They swapped with

1098
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What what

1099
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
They're tasty

1100
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This explains a lot actually

1101
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
This is why Dan's not allowed to eat

1102
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Anything that I don't approve of

1103
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
First

1104
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Anyway

1105
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So they're working on

1106
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
A beta now for

1107
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Well actually they had the beta out for

1108
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Dawn of War 2

1109
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
And that it has

1110
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Already prompted

1111
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
A big massive

1112
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Patch lots of changes

1113
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
To go into the game

1114
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So it is

1115
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Supposed to be

1116
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Going through so if any of the

1117
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Beta players can actually say anything about it

1118
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And I'm sure there's NDA's and

1119
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Whatnot about that

1120
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
They need the patch since it comes out what like

1121
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Next week I mean

1122
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Seriously

1123
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Who knows we might be seeing a delay if it's big enough

1124
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But it was it had to be

1125
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Enough that you know if they're gonna

1126
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In fact actually

1127
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I think this is kind of a fun quote put out

1128
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
By Relic

1129
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Sometimes we just make mistakes

1130
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
We're only human after all

1131
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But other times there are very good and well thought out

1132
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Reasons behind the changes

1133
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Oh we forgot to put legs on the goblins

1134
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Now they can't move

1135
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Shoot naked

1136
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
How about a hug we're only human after all

1137
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I want them to leave in naked

1138
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We are the world

1139
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
You know what

1140
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What

1141
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's war hammer just go

1142
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Play with the lead figures instead

1143
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And make real friends

1144
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Eat the lead figures

1145
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Nice

1146
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Seriously get out of your house and

1147
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Eat some lead figures

1148
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They're not candy

1149
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I know

1150
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
See that's what they should do war hammer

1151
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
40k gummy figures

1152
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That way when you destroy their army

1153
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You can literally bite off their heads

1154
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah you're just like oh battle damage

1155
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Why don't you just use goldfish

1156
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That would actually be a pretty awesome type of role playing game

1157
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Like I want to come up with a role playing game

1158
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's like gummy bear warfare or something

1159
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You could why not they have fuzzy heroes

1160
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I mean it would be awesome

1161
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Fuzzy heroes the game you use with stuffed animals

1162
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Out of jello wigglers

1163
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
TM

1164
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Oh my god I like want to create my own

1165
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Role playing game now that involves me eating

1166
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It's gotta play like advance wars

1167
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Figure this out

1168
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Or totally make it out of chocolate shell and ice cream

1169
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Or even better a role playing game

1170
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That's you know comprised of completely

1171
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
With snack food and like you could build

1172
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Units with different snack foods

1173
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Dark Tetsuya says OL RPG

1174
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm starting to like this idea

1175
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Maybe our fantasy

1176
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah I was gonna say maybe our dream game company

1177
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Can not just make console games but will make

1178
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Table top games too

1179
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And OL RPG will be

1180
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
All based around food

1181
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Just fat princess with RPG elements

1182
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yes I like this idea it's fat princess for real

1183
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
This is a good idea

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I approve of this thought

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Apparently there's a new

1186
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Game coming out that was

1187
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Revealed during Nintendo

1188
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Of Japan's fall media conference

1189
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Of course there

1190
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Was it wasn't

1191
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Really a big title it's a game called

1192
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Kensax and what this is

1193
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Is actually a first party game

1194
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That is tied

1195
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
With a search engine

1196
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Basically you have

1197
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Different games that are in there

1198
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
That require

1199
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Looking for you know

1200
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Making searches on the search engine

1201
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And based on the amount of hits

1202
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That you get you get points

1203
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So for example

1204
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You know they may have like

1205
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You know battle search panel 9

1206
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It says task players

1207
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Or four players with combining the words

1208
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
From a stock

1209
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Of words with a 3x3 board

1210
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And you conduct different search terms

1211
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And whoever finds the

1212
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Highest hit count wins

1213
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And then they have some

1214
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Finding a certain amount

1215
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Plus you can also update it I guess

1216
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It has a library of 3000 words

1217
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And you can add more to it

1218
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And then of course you go online

1219
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
To increase

1220
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The vocabulary plus

1221
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Update search results

1222
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I would think if anything had sex or porn

1223
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
In it you're gonna win

1224
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
This game sounds stupid and boring

1225
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
It sounds like something that you do

1226
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
When you're at work

1227
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And you're on a firewall connection

1228
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Where they've locked out anything good

1229
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And all you can do is just find something

1230
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
To amuse yourself

1231
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
That's exactly what this sounds like

1232
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Dan's got it

1233
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah I know all about that

1234
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
This is so bad it makes me want to punch myself

1235
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Right in the face

1236
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Let's see

1237
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Punch yourself in the face

1238
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
How many search results do we get from that?

1239
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
A lot

1240
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The question is

1241
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
How many results down do you have to go

1242
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Before you actually hit porn?

1243
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Punch yourself in the face

1244
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
265,000 results

1245
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Porn? How many results for porn?

1246
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
245 million for porn

1247
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Porn wins!

1248
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The internet is for porn

1249
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
How about boobs?

1250
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Only 60 million for boobs? What's up with that?

1251
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Anyway, sorry

1252
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Because one thinks if you've got porn

1253
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Boobs come with it

1254
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I mean seriously

1255
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Where there's porn there's boobs

1256
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Hey! Where there's Mario and Sonic

1257
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
There's bound to be the Olympics

1258
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Or something like that

1259
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Of course Mario and Sonic at the Summer Games

1260
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Ended up being pretty much a sleeper hit for Sega

1261
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So it's probably no surprise

1262
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games

1263
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Is official

1264
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And Sega did announce it earlier this week

1265
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic

1266
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Will once again compete on the Wii S

1267
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And the DS in Vancouver

1268
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The Wii S?

1269
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I said the Wii and the DS, right?

1270
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You said the Wii S and the DS

1271
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Works fine

1272
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
The Wii S

1273
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
In Vancouver

1274
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Is where of course the 2010 Olympic Games

1275
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Are being held

1276
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Just in case you want to know how big that first

1277
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Mario game was, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics

1278
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
The first one, 10 million units globally

1279
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
By the way, the new one

1280
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
The Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games

1281
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Is going to support the Wii Balance Board

1282
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Some of the events that will be in it

1283
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Speed skating, alpine skiing

1284
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So on and so on, no news about curling

1285
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
But I hope to hell they did not forget curling

1286
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So there you have it, Mario and Sonic

1287
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
At the Winter Olympics

1288
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
They are making a deck of sporta too

1289
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Are they really? Yes

1290
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You need to branch the whole and Sonic out

1291
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Of the Olympic Games to other mascots

1292
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Like Master Chief and Sonic

1293
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
At the Olympic Games

1294
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Game Guru suggests the next game should be

1295
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Mario and Sonic at the Special Olympics

1296
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I don't know about that

1297
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That might be

1298
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I don't think that got picked up

1299
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Dan was off mic

1300
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Dan said it had to be

1301
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Tails and Toad

1302
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
At the Special Olympics

1303
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
All the characters there

1304
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But he doesn't care about it anymore

1305
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Toadette, I can't stand Toadette

1306
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Toadette definitely is in the Special Olympics

1307
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Game

1308
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
They need to do an evil one with

1309
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Waluigi and Shadow

1310
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
He's trying to destroy the Olympics

1311
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Okay sad trombone

1312
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Sad trombone

1313
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Hey release dates, happy trombone

1314
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Actually can I do a plug? No

1315
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Of course you can do a plug

1316
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Just because

1317
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I am true to my word

1318
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I would actually like to

1319
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Plug a

1320
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Website

1321
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That my

1322
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Only teacher this semester

1323
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Happens to have

1324
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Because I'm sure that we've

1325
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Got other designers

1326
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And people listening to this show

1327
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So I did want to go ahead and give his website a little

1328
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Plug

1329
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
If you go to mahalo.com

1330
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Go look at his fonts

1331
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
They're great

1332
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Now see

1333
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Was that painless?

1334
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Wait spell that again?

1335
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
M-E-H-A-L-L-O

1336
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I put me hello

1337
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh okay

He has some very excellent fonts

1339
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
He designs fonts

1340
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Oh very cool

1341
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We have a new web page

1342
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
On the way

1343
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That's right

1344
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
How about release dates

1345
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
How about release dates?

1346
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000

And remember

1376
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
In the PlayStation 3 version you get

1377
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Ken

1378
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
A figure of Ken

1379
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
In the US

1380
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Over you

1381
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Which was the one we got Ken

1382
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh it was Ryu nevermind

1383
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
No we had a conversation

1384
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
About that

1385
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh yeah and also that Warhammer piece of shit

1386
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah hell yeah

1387
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Of course Dan will argue with you

1388
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Until he is red in the face

1389
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Ken's cooler

1390
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Just cause he wears red

1391
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Which is why I said red in the face

1392
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Not blue in the face

1393
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But yeah that Warhammer crap comes out too

1394
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Not a big

1395
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Warhammer fan are ya?

1396
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000

Today is not the 16th

1406
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000

1407
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000

A virtual lawn but

1431
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000

1432
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And

1433
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Right

1442
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I am not

1443
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You cannot make this stuff up

1444
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
And it is a shooting game

1445
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Just so you guys know

1446
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There's the cover

1447
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
It looks like it's a compilation of other games

1448
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm not sure but

1449
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It looks like it's those old school type of shooting games

1450
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
That are so popular in Japan

1451
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Sonic World Adventure as well

1452
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Star Ocean The Last Hope

1453
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
What the hell is Sonic World Adventure

1454
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Sonic World Adventure is

1455
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Sonic Unleashed

1456
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Then

1457
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I just closed

1458
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
My release dates trying to look up

1459
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
That Sonic thing for

1460
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000

1461
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Star Ocean as well on the 360

1462
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
By the way they are releasing a premium pack

1463
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
On Xbox 360 with Star Ocean

1464
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Coming out in Japan over there as well

1465
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And naturally they are getting

1466
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Street Fighter 4 as well

1467
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
From around the world although I believe the Japanese release

1468
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Just came out for them actually

1469
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000

1470
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Sacred Blaze is a big game coming out this week

1488
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
From Flight Plan

00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000

On the Playstation 2

1491
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000

00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
From Namco Bandai on the PSP this week

1508
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
In Japan

1509
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Remember the good old days when the PSP got games

1510
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And wasn't just used to emulate old consoles

1511
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Yeah but Idol Master

1512
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Is a huge thing in Japan

1513
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I don't think it caught on over here

1514
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I don't really know how you would describe Idol Master

1515
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Never came out over here

1516
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I was totally looking forward to that new Idol Master game

1517
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Isn't it like a take on

1518
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
American Idol type thing

1519
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But it's not actually a singing game

1520
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You guide your contestants through these games somehow

1521
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I don't know

1522
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It's like a sim game

1523
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
There was a game that I used to have on

1524
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
What?

1525
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I used to talk about something irrelevant

1526
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Anyway

1527
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I was actually talking about Dreamcast

1528
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It was a game called Super Producers

1529
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That I never got very far in

1530
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But the way that it was

1531
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
There were different mini games in it

1532
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
That you would manage a pop idol's career

1533
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I don't think it sold very well

1534
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Over there though even

1535
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
But it was a weird game

1536
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I'm telling you, you need to bring back

1537
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
CNC Music Factory

1538
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Make the video thing

1539
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Or something

1540
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Some other type of

1541
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Make the music video game

1542
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Dan was talking about a Cliquavision game

1543
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That was here

1544
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
No

1545
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I don't recall

1546
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
A manager game

1547
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Maybe a football manager game

1548
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I remember those guys

1549
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I had one of those on the Commodore 64

1550
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Of course I didn't know what the hell I was doing

1551
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Anyhow

1552
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news

1553
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
That's going to do it for release dates

1554
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Well, Midway

1555
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Weren't we just singing the joys of Midway

1556
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Last week

1557
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I don't know if you'd say the joys

1558
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Well we were talking about how

1559
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Midway was the

1560
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Pretty cool

1561
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Especially back in the day

1562
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Their arcade collections will really show you

1563
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
How awesome they are

1564
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
They haven't had a lot lately going for them

1565
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Even more than that now

1566
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
They have filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

1567
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Sad trombone

1568
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Basically the CEO

1569
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Matt Booty

1570
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I'm trying not to laugh

1571
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Said that it was a difficult but necessary

1572
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Decision

1573
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Basically for those who don't know

1574
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Chapter 11 gives you

1575
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Relief from your creditors

1576
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So that you can regroup

1577
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And get your financial plan back together

1578
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So

1579
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Some of those creditors that they

1580
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Owed money to

1581
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
At the tune of $281 million

1582
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
In liabilities

1583
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
And of course they only have

1584
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
$167 million in assets

1585
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Wells Fargo Bank

1586
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
They owe $150 million to

1587
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
National Amusements

1588
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
They owe

1589
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Close to $20 million

1590
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And apparently they paid for the manufacturing

1591
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Costs during the

1592
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
For Midway's Holiday lineup

1593
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
NBA Properties Inc

1594
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Almost $17.3 million

1595
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
In licensing and royalty fees

1596
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Warner Brothers Interactive

1597
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
$6.6 million

1598
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
And Epic Games

1599
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
$1.975 million

1600
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
For licensing and royalty fees

1601
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Probably for Unreal Tournament

1602
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Kind of interesting

1603
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That they are

1604
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Doing so horribly

1605
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I also read another story

1606
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That apparently somebody had purchased

1607
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Controlling shares of Midway

1608
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
For only $100,000

1609
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So some dude out there

1610
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Owns like 80% of the company

1611
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Now with $100,000

1612
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
The mystery investor

1613
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yes

1614
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They inherited like

1615
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Millions and millions of dollars in debt

1616
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And basically paid

1617
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Virtually nothing for

1618
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Tons of the rights

1619
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But yeah it's like the mystery investor

1620
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Well supposedly he's supposed to be protected from the debts

1621
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
But he's still gonna make more than

1622
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
$100,000 on the deal

1623
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Oh yeah cause he's gonna get all the rights

1624
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Then he's gonna make

1625
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Mortal Kombat out of his basement

1626
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Mortal Kombat

1627
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Versus like the Care Bears or something

1628
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Mortal Kombat versus your mom

1629
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Nice

1630
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
This doesn't mean though

1631
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
That Midway is like shutting its doors

1632
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Or anything it just means

1633
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But it's not a good sign

1634
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
They might as well

1635
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Just sell Mortal Kombat to somebody else

1636
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Really other than like

1637
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Mortal Kombat there hasn't been a lot that they've put out lately

1638
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
That's been any good

1639
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That's not the purpose though of Chapter 11

1640
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Chapter 11

1641
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Is meant for a company

1642
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That they see recovery in their future

1643
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
This just gives them

1644
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Momentary relief

1645
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Well I have to say though what I think of

1646
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
When I think of Chapter 11 in this day and age

1647
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Is like remember what happened with Mervins

1648
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
The big clothing store chain here in California

1649
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Mervins filed for Chapter 11 and not even a week later

1650
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
They were gone

1651
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Like the liquidators were coming into town

1652
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So you have to worry a little bit

1653
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
It's still a preemptive step

1654
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I mean look at a claim

1655
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Chapter 11 bankruptcy basically

1656
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Gives a company a chance to come to terms

1657
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
With its creditors

1658
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And if the financing is not out there

1659
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
They're hosed

1660
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Circuit City closed down after being in Chapter 11

1661
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I mean if you go back to

1662
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
The 80's

1663
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
This is 80's style

1664
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Worlds of Wonder who made Teddy Ruxpin and laser tech

1665
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yeah

1666
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
They were in Chapter 11 for years

1667
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Because they had strong properties

1668
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And people were always like

1669
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Man we got to extend these guys some credit

1670
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Because they're going to pull it up

1671
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
No they just kept nose diving like 1991

1672
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
And if only they had combined

1673
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Teddy Ruxpin and laser tech together

1674
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
They would have been an unstoppable force

1675
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I bet you they did

1676
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I bet you that somewhere

1677
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
At Worlds of Wonder there was a laser tech

1678
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
That you could like shoot at Teddy Ruxpin

1679
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And he'd be like stop stop

1680
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Aren't you my friend

1681
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Were they the ones that made my buddy

1682
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
My buddy

1683
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
No that was Galoob

1684
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
What happened to Galoob are they

1685
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Micro machines

1686
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Galoob I think got bought up by Hasbro

1687
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Or Mattel or somebody significant

1688
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah I think because they're still

1689
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Making micro machines and those are Galoob

1690
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
As well if I remember right

1691
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I actually think micro machines are now put out under the Hasbro

1692
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Label I think

1693
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
No they probably bought it up

1694
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So

1695
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
If it doesn't say micro machines

1696
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It's not the real thing

1697
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
What ever happened to that guy that talks really fast

1698
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Is he still alive

1699
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
No he's alive

1700
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I'm confused with the guy who is the scat man

1701
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
That guy died

1702
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
John Machito isn't that his name

1703
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I get them mixed up they not only look similar

1704
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But you know

1705
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The scat man guy looks like

1706
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
The micro machines guy

1707
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Oh I see you mean the one from the video

1708
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
That one

1709
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Scat man carter

1710
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
He's like massively dead

1711
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Am I crazy surely people remember the scat man song

1712
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
John Machito is still alive

1713
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Alright good

1714
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Thank you Stufra

1715
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Speaking of companies

1716
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And all this crazy bankruptcy

1717
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And whatever is going on

1718
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
This isn't bankruptcy but it's an acquisition

1719
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Apparently Namco Bandai is looking to

1720
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Acquire D3

1721
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
They're going to buy all of D3 stock

1722
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Apparently

1723
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Namco has already apparently made some deals

1724
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
With the board over at D3

1725
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
They're going to have a 70% stake in the company

1726
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I guess they already have it

1727
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
They're going to purchase the remaining 30%

1728
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
At about $680 a share

1729
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
They're going to have controlling interest

1730
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
In the Naruto property

1731
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Doesn't D3 also make

1732
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Onichibara

1733
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Yeah they do a lot of the ports of the simple series games

1734
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Which really I don't know who the

1735
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Japanese companies are that make these

1736
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But they need to pump out more of them

1737
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I want to see zombies vs ambulances over here

1738
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Remember when Namco was great

1739
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Now they're just watering it down

1740
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
First they poured in a big bucket

1741
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Of Namco or Bandai

1742
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And I mean

1743
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I know Bandai is huge in Japan

1744
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And they make toys and everything but they make crappy ass games

1745
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And Namco made awesome games

1746
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And now Namco Bandai makes kind of crappy games

1747
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And now you're just going to pour another company in there

1748
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
And it's funny you bring that up

1749
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Because they're actually saying that

1750
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
D3 could benefit from

1751
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Especially the Bandai arm, they make the toys

1752
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
TV, arcade

1753
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
They make all this other stuff, movies and stuff

1754
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
That could actually

1755
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Maybe help D3

1756
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Maybe we could get, I don't know, Oni Chambara

1757
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
The TV show, that would be kind of awesome actually

1758
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Bring the movie over

1759
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Maybe we could get some Bikini Samurais and Tekken

1760
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
There you go

1761
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
That'd be kind of cool

1762
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That'd be very cool

1763
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But anyway look for that to happen very soon

1764
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Why can't we have another Klonoa?

1765
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Aren't they bringing the Klonoa remake to Wii or something?

1766
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yeah it's coming out

1767
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
We need a new Klonoa

1768
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Next few months, May I think

1769
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Klonoa is awesome

1770
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
More acquisition news

1771
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You know

1772
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Squeenix

1773
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Is trying to make a purchase

1774
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And Squeenix

1775
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Has done a lot of things

1776
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That have made us go

1777
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
What? Over

1778
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But they are trying to purchase

1779
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Eidos

1780
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And they're trying to

1781
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Basically buy it

1782
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
More than it's worth using

1783
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
129%

1784
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Over their current market value

1785
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So

1786
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
We're looking at

1787
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Grabby grabby Squeenix

1788
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
We're looking at

1789
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
80's style takeover

1790
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So

1791
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
If they want it, they're gonna get it

1792
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
You know what Squeenix does

1793
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
It's ours

1794
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
However

1795
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I do have to say

1796
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That Kotaku is my hero

1797
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
For using a picture of dead Eris

1798
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
To advertise this

1799
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So

1800
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
That makes me quite happy

1801
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Kind of an interesting merger

1802
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
If you think about it

1803
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
With the whole

1804
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Tomb Raider series

1805
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Going

1806
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
You know

1807
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
What else does Eidos have over there?

1808
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I can't remember some of the other big stuff they publish

1809
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Hitman

1810
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
They have Just Cause coming out

1811
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
At some point

1812
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Well Just Cause 2 at least

1813
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Interesting because those are the

1814
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Types of games Squeenix never really seems

1815
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
To get involved with so that would be a very interesting

1816
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Sort of merger especially if Squeenix is really wanting

1817
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
To get into the western development or whatever

1818
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You know

1819
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You guys are killing me with this Squeenix thing by the way

1820
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's Squeenix

1821
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
We like to call it Squeenix

1822
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
The god damn company is called Enix

1823
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It's Squeenix

1824
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Actually it's Square Enix

1825
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
It's the whole thing

1826
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
They don't abbreviate it at all

1827
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
But we say Squeenix

1828
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Squeenix is terrible

1829
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
That's the most bizarre merger

1830
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
You wonder why Square Enix would even bother

1831
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You know

1832
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Any decent franchises that Eidos had

1833
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Any good development studios that they had

1834
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
They're pretty much flushed

1835
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I mean

1836
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I guess you might get a

1837
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Kane and Lynch, woo!

1838
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Kane and Lynch, yeah!

1839
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Battle Stations

1840
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I think that series

1841
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So the Battle Stations Pacific or something

1842
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Is coming out

1843
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Yeah, it's nothing that's really exciting

1844
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
You know, Tomb Raider is kind of what they have

1845
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And like I said

1846
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Maybe Hitman

1847
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Although you gotta wonder about the viability of the Hitman

1848
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Franchise because they didn't even bring out a game to go with

1849
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It's really crappy movie

1850
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
You know, what are you

1851
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Gonna do with that company?

1852
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Tomb Raider RPG?

1853
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You know, I don't know

1854
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Maybe it would save the franchise a little bit

1855
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
AlphaKananagram in chat suggests

1856
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
It's called Square Anus

1857
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Is actually what the chat

1858
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Actually it's

1859
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Don't even guess on NX, because NX is an awesome company

1860
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And Square used to be great too

1861
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It's the bizarre combination of them that just

1862
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Has fallen into RPG hell

1863
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Remember when Square made Einhonder?

1864
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Remember when NX made fucking Actraiser?

1865
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Yeah, and NX made Actraiser

1866
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And Illusion of Gaia

1867
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And that whole series

1868
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Secret of Mana

1869
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Bust a Move

1870
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Dude, NX made Bust a Move

1871
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Those companies just made

1872
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Great games, now it's just

1873
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Rehash for old RPGs

1874
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Bring out new crappy JRPGs

1875
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
You know, what? Come on

1876
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
This is what I demand out of Square Enix for

1877
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Penance, is a new Bust a Move game

1878
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
That's what I want

1879
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
None of this Dance Summit 2001 crap

1880
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
No, Burn in Hell

1881
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It's got to have Hero-kun

1882
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And it's got to have Heat and Sprite

1883
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I want a reboot of the Bust a Move series

1884
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's got to be completely uncensored when they bring it to America

1885
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So people are smoking and drinking and shooting each other

1886
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
And then they dance their way out of it

1887
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
That game was awesome

1888
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
That game was beyond awesome

1889
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I love the fact that one of the attacks was that Strike was shooting you

1890
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
In fact, I just gave you

1891
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We should put it right now

1892
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Squenix, I gave you the new tagline

1893
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Bust a Move 3, Beyond Awesome

1894
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Bust a Move

1895
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Dance or Bust a Cap on your end

1896
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Bust a Cap

1897
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
You got served

1898
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Rama says God dammit Square Enix

1899
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I want Rad Racer 3

1900
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Yeah, Rad Racer rules

1901
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Only if it has

1902
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
3D when you hit the select button

1903
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Yeah, and you've got to be able to change the tracks

1904
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And the Nintendo music has to be there

1905
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Which in this day and age, it might actually be

1906
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Kind of doable with this whole stuff they're talking about

1907
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
3D, can you imagine

1908
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Remember when they were talking about that the Wii's top secret thing

1909
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Was going to be 3D projection

1910
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
In your room and all this fucking bullshit

1911
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Why did we ever believe that fucking shit

1912
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Because that would be super awesome

1913
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And really innovative

1914
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And then they're like, no, we don't want to do that

1915
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
People love to give Nintendo

1916
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Way more credit than they deserve

1917
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Anyhow, forget it

1918
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Let's uh

1919
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Let's get into some other stories

1920
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Sorry

1921
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Because remember it's only good for Nintendo

1922
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
To innovate unless it will benefit their

1923
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Casual audience

1924
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
That's what it really comes down to

1925
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Yes, indeed

1926
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So if you're a casual

1927
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Game purchaser

1928
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Perhaps you're looking for a rental

1929
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Solution, in which case

1930
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
You know, of course there's Gamefly

1931
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Out there for you, but if you don't want to do

1932
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Gamefly, maybe Blockbuster Total

1933
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Access. They actually

1934
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Had Total Access for a while now with

1935
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Movies, but now they've incorporated games

1936
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Into their subscription plan

1937
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And basically it will work

1938
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Kind of similar to

1939
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
You know, how it does with movies

1940
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Except it'll cost a little bit more if you rent a game

1941
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I think it's like, it upsets five

1942
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Additional dollars

1943
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
The plans are $19.99 a month

1944
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
You know, for the movie side and of course

1945
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
$5 if a game is

1946
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Rented as well

1947
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And then what's kind of different with

1948
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
The Total Access plan versus

1949
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Gamefly, is Gamefly

1950
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You can only mail your stuff back

1951
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
With Total Access you can actually take it into a store

1952
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And swap it in a store

1953
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So you can do it in the store or over the mail

1954
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
So, that's kind of neat

1955
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'm thinking about switching to the Blockbuster thing

1956
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Only because they have this whole in the store thing

1957
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That you can do, and sometimes I don't want to wait for

1958
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Netflix, you know

1959
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Well, in the store is not a bad thing

1960
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Especially with Gamefly and stuff

1961
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's a good program to get stuff mailed to you

1962
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But sometimes you want the instant gratification

1963
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Where you can just go to the store

1964
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Okay, I want to rent that game, done

1965
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But I don't want to lose instant Netflix

1966
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Like, I also like instant Netflix

1967
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
That would be ultimate

1968
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
But the Netflix streaming is awesome

1969
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
There is a rumor though

1970
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
That they're going to somehow incorporate this

1971
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Into the Playstation Network

1972
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Oh, please let this be true

1973
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
So, I don't know if that's actually going to happen or not

1974
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
But it's rumored that

1975
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Maybe they're thinking about it

1976
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Sony can't do anything that cool anymore

1977
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
So, don't bet on it

1978
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Sony will find a way to screw it up

1979
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I wish they would prove you wrong on that

1980
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
It would be great though if you were walking around at home

1981
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And you could walk up to your TV and turn it on

1982
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And like, you know, your total access menu

1983
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Would come up and you had streaming

1984
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Or I could just bypass that home bullshit

1985
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Just hit a button

1986
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You could make your dude sit down and watch it

1987
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And look bored, I think that would be awesome

1988
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
And then smoke a bowl

1989
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
That's what I think

1990
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Watching Cheech and Chung on Blockbuster

1991
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
So, it would be really interesting

1992
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
If they had, you know

1993
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Context sensitive reactions

1994
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So, if they watch a sad movie

1995
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
They'll sit there and cry

1996
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
If they watch Cheech and Chung, they'll sit there and neck toke

1997
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Which would be hilarious

1998
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Not likely, but hilarious

1999
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
But I just think that would be pretty cool

2000
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yeah, somehow I don't think that would get by

2001
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Like the Sony sensors or what have you

2002
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Well, I don't think the smoking dope thing would happen

2003
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
But I think that, you know, having your little dude watch TV

2004
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I mean, come on

2005
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
A bajillion freaking people play The Sims

2006
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So, you know, and they watch

2007
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Their Sims do nothing

2008
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I don't want that home bullshit

2009
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Then don't use it, you don't have to

2010
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I'm saying it would be cool if it was there

2011
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
God damn it, you're missing the point

2012
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Just so I could see it that one time and go

2013
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Wow, that's fucking cool, okay, I'm done

2014
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
There you go

2015
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
It's like a stream saver for your life

2016
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It's called how many millions of dollars does Sony have to spend

2017
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
To get me to say, wow, that's fucking cool, next

2018
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Well, if it makes someone say

2019
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Wow, that's fucking cool enough for me to buy a PS3

2020
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I mean, come on

2021
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
How many systems has Nintendo sold with the controller

2022
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
For the Wii

2023
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
People are like, ooh, I can wave my hand

2024
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
This is great, oh wow, it really sucks

2025
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
For actual gameplay

2026
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
That's really sad

2027
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
I don't know

2028
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I don't know what to tell you

2029
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
But yeah

2030
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You can look for that blockbuster

2031
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Thing coming soon, I guess

2032
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Or is that now, that you can do the game thing now

2033
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I think it's very soon

2034
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
If not now

2035
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I kind of want to do that, but I still want Netflix too

2036
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
For streaming

2037
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Just quandary

2038
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I don't want both, it's too much money

2039
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Or just, I don't know, go rent a movie

2040
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Here's the other thing

2041
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
If you change your address

2042
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Hollywood Video will send you a bunch of these

2043
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Welcome to the neighborhood

2044
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Free game or free movie

2045
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
My sister has moved apartments

2046
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
In her complex a few times

2047
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
She's got a ton of those things

2048
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
She keeps bouncing from different Hollywood videos

2049
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Because they'll let her do it over and over

2050
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Or if she doesn't rent anything

2051
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
From a Hollywood video for a while

2052
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
They'll eventually call her and say, hey, do you want free rental

2053
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Come back in the store type thing

2054
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So she bounces between three different Hollywood videos

2055
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And they keep sending her those

2056
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
That sounds like entirely too much effort

2057
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
To save the five, six bucks

2058
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
She's poor, so yeah

2059
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
She's poor

2060
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Entertainment? However I could get it

2061
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Alright

2062
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Hey the DS Lite Onyx version

2063
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
That would be the black one for most of us

2064
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Call it the Black DS Lite

2065
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Apparently, shut up, apparently

2066
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
It has been discontinued

2067
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
At least

2068
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
That is the rumor

2069
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Going on

2070
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And Loki is confirming

2071
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
It's happened

2072
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Nintendo is discontinuing the Onyx DS Lite

2073
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I have a rare system then

2074
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Black DS Lite

2075
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Is coming out the door

2076
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
The only four colors left

2077
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Metallic Silver, Metallic Rose

2078
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Black in Cobalt Blue

2079
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
And Black in Crimson Red

2080
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Pink, Pinker, Pinkest, and Very Pink

2081
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Are the four colors that are left

2082
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Of the DS

2083
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Is this because

2084
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
This is kind of the thought process

2085
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Going around

2086
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
That a DSi is coming relatively soonish

2087
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And that the DSi is going to be black

2088
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
They did the same thing

2089
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
With the White DS

2090
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
After a while they just want to stop

2091
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Making

2092
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
A certain color

2093
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I don't know

2094
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Because five colors is too many

2095
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But four is just right I guess

2096
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I guess

2097
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Anyhow, let's get into

2098
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
A segment of the show we like to do every week

2099
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio

2100
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It's a moment for us to respect the classics

2101
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
We need to pay tribute to those games

2102
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
That came before the ones we're talking about this week

2103
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
It's a little segment we call

2104
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Dark Sakura's Classic Video Game of the Week

2105
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Dark Sakura has dug through

2106
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
The Classic Game Archive, I'm assuming with Dan's

2107
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Help a little bit this week, and has picked

2108
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
One game to highlight

2109
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
For you folks on the show tonight

2110
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
What game have you picked?

2111
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Today's game is The Revenge of Shinobi

2112
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And Dan did inspire me to pick it

2113
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
We had

2114
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
A little bit of a conversation last night

2115
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
About copyrighted characters

2116
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Making their way into

2117
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Different releases of this game

2118
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So I thought it would be worth mentioning

2119
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Plus it does have some pretty cool music

2120
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
As I was about to say

2121
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
This soundtrack is

2122
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
By Yuzo Koshiro

2123
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And

2124
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
It's actually

2125
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
You can also find it in the Mega Games 2

2126
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Mega Drive 6-Pack, Sega Classics

2127
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Arcade Collection for Sega CD

2128
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And the Sega Smash Pack for PC and Dreamcast

2129
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
But not on Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Book

2130
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Also the

2131
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Is saying that the introductory game screen

2132
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Has

2133
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Sonny Chiba

2134
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
As Hattori Hanzo

2135
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
From the Kage no Gungan series

2136
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So that's pretty cool

2137
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Anyway

2138
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
It is a side schooling platform

2139
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Game

2140
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
You control Joe Musashi

2141
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And go through 8th districts

2142
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
And you actually have to

2143
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Defeat the head of Mio Zeed

2144
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
There's three scenes in each level

2145
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
With their own boss characters

2146
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
And you use the D-Pad, A, B, and C buttons

2147
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
To do your

2148
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Ninjutsu attack

2149
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Your regular attack, and your jump

2150
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And you also have a somersault

2151
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Move

2152
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
That you can press the jump button

2153
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
And then press it again

2154
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
At the height of your jump

2155
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So that you can jump more

2156
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And throw eight shuriken in the air

2157
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
At the same time

2158
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
So

2159
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You can actually go

2160
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Over different layers

2161
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
In the area

2162
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Like you can be in the foreground

2163
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
In the background, indoor, outdoor

2164
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Or on the highway

2165
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
You have

2166
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
You have different

2167
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Ninjutsu techniques

2168
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
You've got

2169
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Ninjutsu no

2170
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Ikazuchi

2171
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Karyu, Fushin, and Mijin

2172
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And respectively

2173
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
The first one is lightning

2174
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
The second one is flame

2175
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
The third one is more jumping

2176
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And the last one is explosions

2177
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
It actually costs you one life

2178
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
But

2179
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
If you don't have a life

2180
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Then you can't do it

2181
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
You also have bonus crates

2182
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That have stuff hidden in them

2183
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
So you can just go beat up stuff

2184
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
It has easy, normal, hard, and hardest

2185
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Just meaning more enemies

2186
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And a shorter life bar

2187
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The Japanese version called

2188
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
The Super Shinobi

2189
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
There are options

2190
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
For no death

2191
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And level select

2192
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So

2193
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
The different stages

2194
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Is Ibaraki

2195
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
The province of Japan, Tokyo

2196
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
The military base, Detroit

2197
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Area code 818

2198
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Chinatown

2199
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
New York, and Neo-Z Marine

2200
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Stronghold

2201
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
So now we come to the different versions

2202
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
As I was mentioning, there are different copyrighted characters

2203
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
In the different versions

2204
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And I think you had one

2205
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Don't we have one?

2206
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
This game, just so everyone knows

2207
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Was fucking awesome

2208
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It was the reason to buy a Genesis

2209
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Back in the day

2210
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And one of the things that was so great about it

2211
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Besides the fact that it's got

2212
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Brutal, unforgiving difficulty

2213
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
If you don't push it out and play on easy

2214
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Is that as you play through the game

2215
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You ran into

2216
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Like, classic movies

2217
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
There was a boss

2218
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Who was Spider-Man

2219
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And he stayed as Spider-Man

2220
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Sega had a Spider-Man license

2221
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
He would crawl on Spider-Man for a while

2222
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
He would crawl off the screen

2223
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And he would come back and it was Batman

2224
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And I mean, if it wasn't

2225
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
You know, it wasn't a licensed Batman

2226
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
But it would just like Batman

2227
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And in one of the subsequent re-releases

2228
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Of the same cartridge

2229
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
It was the same game

2230
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
They replaced him with, you know, a Batman

2231
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Not Batman

2232
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
One of the enemies looked like Rambo

2233
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
They took off his hair

2234
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So he didn't look like Rambo anymore

2235
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And there's a guy

2236
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Who looks like, there's a Terminator

2237
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I mean, he looks like Schwarzenegger

2238
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
When you hit him, his skin starts coming off

2239
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And he's a cyborg underneath

2240
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And he blows up Terminator style

2241
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And finally, there's Godzilla

2242
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
And it's, you know, Godzilla

2243
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
You know, towering

2244
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And breathing fire

2245
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And they replaced him with a

2246
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Like a weird skeleton

2247
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Not Mechagodzilla

2248
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Which would have been even cooler

2249
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
That might be part of the reason why it missed out

2250
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
On the Mega Genesis collection thing that just came out

2251
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Is that maybe these strange licensed

2252
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Bosses kept it out of the collection

2253
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Well, it's strange enough

2254
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Because Revenge of Shinobi

2255
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
If you heard it, it's been on like six collections

2256
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
It was on all the ones through the Dreamcast

2257
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It was on

2258
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
PC collections

2259
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I mean, I'm sure that that's one of the things

2260
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
That knocked it down, probably honestly

2261
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
The Spider-Man license

2262
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Because even in the

2263
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
The Shinobi for the

2264
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
For the

2265
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection

2266
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
They recolored the quote-unquote

2267
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Spider-Man enemies from

2268
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Red and blue to yellow and blue

2269
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
So, you know, probably a little bit of

2270
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
You know, hey, don't want to get sued by

2271
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Marvel this time around

2272
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
But I'm sure that that's what it is

2273
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
But the real pity of that is

2274
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Is this would have been just an awesome

2275
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Chance, you know, to

2276
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
To have the Shinobi

2277
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
One, two, and three

2278
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
All at hand

2279
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Yeah, that is the one bummer because with so many

2280
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Complete Sega

2281
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Franchises there, it's kind of a bummer to have this

2282
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
One missing, but did you notice there's one other

2283
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Big franchise that's missing, Strider

2284
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Was missing

2285
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Oh, it's Capcom, oh, that's right, it's not Sega

2286
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I thought Sega did it

2287
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I've been thinking about this

2288
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And this is something that I can kind of go off about

2289
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Because on Ultimate Genesis

2290
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Collection, I mean, it's far from the

2291
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Ultimate Genesis Collection

2292
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
It's a great, great collection

2293
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But it's got some clunkers that they could have

2294
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Replaced with way better Sega games

2295
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And I'm sure that that's being saved for Sonic's

2296
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Even more Ultimate Genesis Collection, too

2297
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But, I mean, there was no Shadow Dancer

2298
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
The Secret of Shinobi

2299
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
You know, you could have had

2300
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
More arcade unlockables, like

2301
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
You had, you know, if you played Shinobi 3

2302
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
You unlocked Shinobi 1, which was great

2303
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I was so happy, but wouldn't it have been really cool

2304
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
To have been able to play Shadow Dancer

2305
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
The arcade version of Shadow Dancer

2306
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Wouldn't it have been great to have been able to

2307
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Have unlocked, you know, maybe

2308
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Had Outrun on there

2309
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Oh yeah, that was missing, huh

2310
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You know, just Thunder Blade

2311
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
You know, they had Super Thunder Blade

2312
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
But not the way better arcade Thunder Blade

2313
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
After Burner, I mean, there were

2314
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So many significant, I mean, that thing could have had

2315
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
30 more games

2316
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And then arcade versions of those same games

2317
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And it just would have been just fantastic

2318
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
But I guess you can't expect Sega

2319
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Company for 30 bucks, I expected

2320
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Though, so they should have done it

2321
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But yeah, it would have been really cool to have

2322
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Just had the whole Shinobi franchise

2323
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
In one place, you know, had the lock on

2324
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Technology with the Sonic and that, but

2325
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
You know, back to Revenge of Shinobi

2326
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
It's awesome, if you have a Sega Genesis

2327
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Kicking around, it's a super common

2328
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Cartridge, you might get lucky

2329
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Find that you have one of the early release cartridges

2330
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
With all the, all the bosses

2331
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Even the one I had back in the day, had the Rambo

2332
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Guys edited, the one I have now

2333
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Actually does have the Rambo Guys

2334
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
So I was pretty stoked when I was playing it

2335
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Super, super awesome game

2336
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Really hard

2337
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
There's more changes actually

2338
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
They also did

2339
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
For a release

2340
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
1.02

2341
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Which was the last release

2342
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
They also did put up an

2343
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Acknowledgement of the Spider-Man copyright

2344
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
And there was only

2345
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
One ending you had to

2346
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Save now, go to win the game

2347
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah, the way that you get the ending in that game

2348
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Is totally cool

2349
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You get into the final level

2350
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And I think, I mean I'm sure a lot of people

2351
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Have done it, because again, when you play, when you talk to people online

2352
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You always find out that the game you thought you were a

2353
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Bato at, people are better

2354
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But to get the final ending

2355
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You had to fight the boss

2356
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
While your girl ran around in the background

2357
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And a giant cement block

2358
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Lowered towards her

2359
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And if you couldn't beat the boss fast enough

2360
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
She got smooshed

2361
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And you got a cool, solitary, ninja-like ending

2362
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
And if you won

2363
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
You know, you're standing there on the edge of the cliff

2364
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
With your girlfriend, it looks like something out of Castlevania

2365
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
But you have a girl with you

2366
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
And it's awesome, so

2367
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You have to have some techniques

2368
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
You can't just slop through the final boss battle

2369
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
But yeah, I guess one of the later releases

2370
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You couldn't win if you didn't save your girlfriend

2371
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Also

2372
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
There was

2373
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
In the European version

2374
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
The shuriken is replaced by throwing knives

2375
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Because of legal status at the time

2376
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It's

2377
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Pretty cool, actually

2378
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
A bunch of the music was performed

2379
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
At the fourth symphonic

2380
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Game music concert

2381
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
In Leipzig

2382
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And it was also performed

2383
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
At two of the concerts of play

2384
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And

2385
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It's

2386
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
It was also at the

2387
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Same play concert

2388
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
In Singapore in June 2007

2389
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So there you go

2390
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
That's super

2391
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
That's for Revenge of Shinobi

2392
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I was

2393
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Alright, there you got it

2394
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
As far as game music goes too

2395
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
This made Yuzo Kishiro

2396
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
So if you're into game music

2397
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
If you're really interested in his work

2398
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And you haven't played Revenge of Shinobi

2399
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
What are you doing?

2400
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
So definitely one of the most notable

2401
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Missing games from the

2402
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Genesis collection just recently came out

2403
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Revenge of Shinobi is the classic game of the week

2404
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
So you'll have to check it out somehow else

2405
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Besides the classic game collection

2406
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
For those of you guys checking that out this week

2407
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Good pick Dark Sakura and Dan

2408
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
This week on the classic game

2409
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Of the week

2410
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
And that is going to bring to a close

2411
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
A new program but don't go anywhere

2412
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
We'll be right back after a little break

2413
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
With some more of Orange Lounge Radio

2414
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And in part beats tonight we're going to be talking

2415
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
A little bit about the new website

2416
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I know it's some exciting new information

2417
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Talk a little bit about Fear 2

2418
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Grand Theft Auto 4

2419
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
More Sega if you can believe it

2420
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Some very interesting trademarks

2421
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Persona 4

2422
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And Konami getting a little taste

2423
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Of their own medicine this week

2424
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
We're going to be talking about that also a little bit

2425
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
More of Orange Lounge Radio

2426
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2427
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
On this Sunday evening February the 15th

2428
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Of 2009 the day after

2429
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Valentine's Day

2430
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And here in studio unfortunately JTV

2431
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Stopped working

2432
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
We were having problems on the server end so we just

2433
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Decided to say screw it

2434
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And we hooked up Street Fighter 4

2435
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Which is what we're playing right now on the in studio TV

2436
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
We will try to get it up on Justin TV

2437
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
If we're able to get back on there

2438
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
We already tried reconnecting it didn't work

2439
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
It's on there and it's something

2440
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Some JTV channels are up but not us

2441
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
But we'll be back on Justin TV hopefully soon

2442
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And it's just going to be footage of Street Fighter 4

2443
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
With us talking so that should be interesting

2444
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
When people tune into that

2445
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
But wow this game looks pretty awesome

2446
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Although this is not the TV to be demonstrating

2447
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
That was the best ever

2448
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Dan of course is playing Dan

2449
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
His namesake character

2450
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
He did a little special move

2451
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
He's fighting El Fuerte right now

2452
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And did this little special move that knocked him up in the air

2453
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
But right at the end he did his signature little thumbs up

2454
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And tooth shining pull thing

2455
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That was great

2456
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Nice

2457
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I love that like one of the best characters

2458
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
In the game

2459
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Well one of the most fun characters in the game

2460
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Is just a total joke

2461
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Very very nice though

2462
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I want to say this as well in the chat

2463
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And SSJ100Matt reminded me of this

2464
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
At the top of part B as well

2465
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
We got a swag bag from our New York

2466
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
City contingent

2467
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Specifically SSJ100Matt I believe

2468
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Put this all together for us I don't know if he had some help

2469
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Or what have you but we want to say a big

2470
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Big thank you to them for getting

2471
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Us some of the swag including lots of

2472
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars

2473
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Stuff which Loki took it all

2474
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
But we have like a Splatterhouse poster

2475
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
We're going to put up here in studio and some other cool stuff too

2476
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
So we're going to fill some of the blank space on our wall

2477
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
With some of those posters from

2478
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
The New York Comic Con

2479
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So thank you guys very very very very much for that

2480
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Yay

2481
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Alright so I'm just like hypnotized

2482
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
By Street Fighter IV now I don't even know if I can do news

2483
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I just kind of I really want to play it

2484
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
I can do news

2485
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Alright Loki why don't you start us off with some news

2486
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I actually want to run in the house and get some tea

2487
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So Street Fighter IV will have to wait

2488
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And I think Dan doesn't want to give it up anyway

2489
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
So why don't you get into some news Loki

2490
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
He has unlocked me and the other two characters

2491
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Anyways

2492
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Fear II they had some pretty

2493
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Interesting advertisement

2494
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
For Fear II in the UK

2495
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Actually they had trained

2496
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Black cats that were

2497
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Walking around and

2498
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Advertising with Fear II little

2499
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
T-shirts on it's cat-vertising

2500
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
So

2501
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
It's pretty awesome actually and

2502
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
You know I didn't know you can

2503
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Train cats so I think that's even more

2504
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Amazing right there

2505
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
You can train cats? Yeah but

2506
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Cat shows really do tricks like dogs do

2507
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
To be your minions of advertising?

2508
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
I mean I'm surprised

2509
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
But you know they didn't have their own agenda

2510
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But anyways

2511
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
What's even cooler is if you happen to live

2512
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
In the UK there's a number you can call to get your own

2513
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Fear II cat shirt

2514
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I totally okay

2515
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
For our UK listeners somebody get me a shirt

2516
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
For Shermy

2517
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah

2518
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Make sure it's a 3XL cat size

2519
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And I'll

2520
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Get a fat fucking cat

2521
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I love my cat I know

2522
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And I will put it on her and model her

2523
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
With the fear shirt on

2524
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
You could just probably get like a

2525
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I don't know if you could

2526
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I want an official fear shirt for my cat

2527
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Oh

2528
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Well I don't know who knows

2529
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
And then later on it's probably Dolphys sized

2530
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Pose

2531
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Oh sweet

2532
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
See now we're just going to be distracted by Street Fighter

2533
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
It's going to be terrible

2534
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Apparently yeah it's um

2535
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
If you live in London

2536
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
During the next few days you know you might have

2537
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Or seen you know

2538
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
It was actually going on from mid-week to

2539
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
About the Friday the 13th

2540
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You might have seen these cats walking around

2541
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Catpartizing

2542
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I think it's awesome I would put

2543
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
One of these on my cat if she wouldn't you know claw

2544
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Me to death but

2545
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Biohaze20 in chat asks

2546
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
My cat talks and smokes a lot of pot

2547
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Is that eligible for cat shows?

2548
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I don't know that might get it disqualified

2549
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Does the cat actually

2550
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Smoke pot or do you blow

2551
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Pot smoke in the cat's face?

2552
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
That would be for the stoned olympics

2553
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Remember Eddie Isher talked

2554
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
About the stoned olympics

2555
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
What's that?

2556
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I've not heard of this

2557
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Well you're tested for drugs to make sure that you've taken enough

2558
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I see

2559
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Drugs are bad

2560
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Drugs are very bad

2561
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I think they're badass

2562
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
What else is bad for you but Grand Theft Auto 4

2563
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Is very very bad for you

2564
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
But that doesn't stop many of you

2565
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
The Lost and the Damned of course is coming out

2566
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
This coming week

2567
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
The 17th

2568
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
A lot of people are going to be

2569
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Very busy when that comes out

2570
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
The hell with Street Fighter 4

2571
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Good thing you were able to get Street Fighter 4 early

2572
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
You're going to be ready to move on

2573
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
This level is beautiful

2574
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
What stage is this?

2575
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
This is the Midnight Jungle

2576
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Anyhow

2577
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
It's going to be like this for the whole second half of the show tonight

2578
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
It's okay

2579
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Grand Theft Auto 4

2580
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Lost in the Damned

2581
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Not only is it coming with

2582
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Of course all the great

2583
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Download content

2584
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
A free week of multiplayer

2585
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
From the 17th to the 22nd

2586
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
It's called a Game with Rockstar event

2587
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
You can play Lost in the Damned online

2588
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
For free if you don't have Xbox Live Gold

2589
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Although I'm surprised there's that many folks

2590
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Out there that have this game and not have Xbox Live Gold

2591
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
But I guess there's enough

2592
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
There you go

2593
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Yeah really you need it online anyways

2594
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Because there's not much to do if you don't have it

2595
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And you beat the game

2596
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I don't know

2597
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
It's weird though because even this game

2598
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
When Saints Row 2 came out

2599
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I'm going to be playing Saints Row 2 a lot more than Grand Theft Auto 4

2600
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Not the case

2601
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
It's so weird

2602
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I don't know

2603
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Alright

2604
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I'm going to have to interrupt here

2605
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I know that Dark Sakura is dying to do

2606
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
A story here

2607
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
But I have an OLR special bulletin

2608
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
If you will

2609
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I need the theme music

2610
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
For when we have special bulletins

2611
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I used to have a little trumpet announcement thing

2612
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
We used to do

2613
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
How about this Rob?

2614
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
What?

2615
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
That'll work

2616
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
The new website is live

2617
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
So check it out

2618
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Orangelaunchradio.com

2619
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
And there it is

2620
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Orangelaunchradio.com is up

2621
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
So check it out

2622
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
You know what that earns?

2623
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
What?

2624
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
No in all reality though

2625
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm actually loading it up right now

2626
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
In all reality we want to say a big big big big big

2627
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Thank you to

2628
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Deakman

2629
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And VXJsonXV

2630
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
For their hard work on getting the new website up and running

2631
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
What do you mean it isn't?

2632
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
For everybody that put that together

2633
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
It's amazing

2634
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
It has a little space invader

2635
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
As Tigerclaw says in chat

2636
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
It's much easier on the eyes than the old site

2637
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Well maybe there are some

2638
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Splashes of other color

2639
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
We're going to be adding light

2640
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
When we add new stories

2641
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
We can upload pictures

2642
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Do reviews work?

2643
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
You can just add a review

2644
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
It's a new story

2645
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So I have

2646
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I know I'm going to miss the old photo too

2647
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
And in other announcements JustinTV is still networking

2648
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Alright so

2649
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Thank you guys again very much

2650
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
And yay for that

2651
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
So we'll talk more about the new website

2652
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I am posting photographic proof

2653
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Hold on hold on

2654
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I forgot about that there's that little thing

2655
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
The gallery

2656
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
If you check this out there's a new gallery on Orangelaunchradio.com

2657
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
And you can go into the OL army pics

2658
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And you can look at pictures that our people have uploaded

2659
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Please don't abuse this

2660
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But Dark Soccer right now

2661
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Is taking pictures of us playing Street Fighter 4

2662
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Here in studio

2663
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And she's going to upload them to

2664
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
The OL army pics gallery

2665
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
There's Dark Tetsuya with an old ass

2666
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Pinball table

2667
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
There's our messy floor

2668
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Some people have been uploading random stuff

2669
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Alright so Dark Soccer is working on that right now

2670
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It's like JustinTV but ghetto

2671
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
So there you go

2672
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Alright let's try and go back to

2673
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Gaming news if we can

2674
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Oh we're on

2675
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Dark Soccer's turn

2676
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And she's up and taking pictures

2677
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Rezz

2678
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Hi

2679
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Rezz

2680
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Rezz an 18 wheeler

2681
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
What do these two games have in common?

2682
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Sega re-registered the trademarks

2683
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
For Rezz an 18 wheeler

2684
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
American pro trucker

2685
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And they were Dreamcast titles as you might recall

2686
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
But hey we've also got

2687
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
The Rezz

2688
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Remix thingamadookie right?

2689
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Thingamadookie

2690
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Rezz HD Remix thingamadookie

2691
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Yeah for MatchingService

2692
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Dot com

2693
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
But no we've uh

2694
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So they've uh

2695
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Renewed those so who knows

2696
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
We may have

2697
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
New truck in action with a

2698
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Really poppy soundtrack

2699
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Yeah that's what I'm hoping is that they actually combine

2700
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
The two games and we get 18 wheeler

2701
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

2702
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Uh oh

2703
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
It's Sakura vs. Dan on Street Fighter 4

2704
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
So

2705
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
This is

2706
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Just going to bug us all night

2707
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Why are you Sakura?

2708
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Oh

2709
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Anyhow

2710
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Who knows what interesting games

2711
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Could come of these remake trademarks

2712
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I don't know

2713
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
This picture is going up because this is our

2714
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Daily life at home

2715
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Dan vs. Sakura

2716
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
What's interesting though

2717
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And this is kind of a rumor that's been around for a while now

2718
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
In fact I remember another story about this

2719
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
The Sega vintage collection

2720
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Is rumored to be coming to

2721
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Xbox Live Arcade

2722
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
You may remember a while back

2723
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
They had some screenshots of

2724
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
The Sega vintage collection with like

2725
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
The Sonic the Hedgehog games or something like that

2726
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Well apparently this vintage

2727
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Collection is supposed to be bringing

2728
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Some of the old Genesis games to

2729
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Xbox Live Arcade

2730
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Some of these games you might expect

2731
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Are Gunstar Heroes, Comic Zone

2732
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Altered Beasts, Shinobi 3

2733
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And Sonic the Hedgehog 3

2734
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Okay but

2735
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I just bought all of those games on the Mega Genesis

2736
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Collection so what's the freaking point

2737
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Gunstar Heroes not on it

2738
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Okay one game

2739
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And I also

2740
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I already bought Gunstar Hero because it was one of the first

2741
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Virtual console games on the Wii

2742
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I don't get it either but you know then again they also released

2743
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Hedgehog and stuff by Stand Alone

2744
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
So maybe people

2745
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Want just one game and

2746
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
It just, I don't see the value in that

2747
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And you know

2748
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I see Game Grumps says it's on PSN as well

2749
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Maybe I have the

2750
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Collection thingy on PS3 so

2751
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
You know and sadly the only way that this would actually

2752
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Work as far as being you know worthwhile

2753
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Is if they had those like say 4 or 5

2754
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Games and charged like maybe

2755
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
5 or 10 bucks for it or something like that

2756
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
And then having it kind of like a mini

2757
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Version of that collection but at the same time

2758
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It's like what's the big deal, what's the point

2759
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Cause you can just go purchase you know 40 games

2760
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
For you know 30 bucks

2761
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Or you can wait for the price drop and you'll get

2762
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
40 games for 20 bucks

2763
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I don't know

2764
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I don't know either it's a little interesting

2765
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
But it's a rumor right now it's coming from a

2766
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Dutch gaming site but

2767
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
It's kind of weird though that we see two of these same types

2768
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Of rumors happening you know before

2769
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
So I don't know

2770
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
AcidicVampire in chat says achievement whores will

2771
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Buy it that's true achievement whores

2772
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Will definitely buy it

2773
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Very very true

2774
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Well

2775
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Another fighting game going on

2776
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Out there in the world not just street fighter

2777
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
4 but how many of you guys

2778
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Are fans of wrestlemania

2779
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Nobody? Ok

2780
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I used to be a fan of wrestlemania

2781
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
But you miss the classics right

2782
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
You miss the classic wrestlemania like Hulk Hogan

2783
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And all those people well the good news is there's a

2784
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Game coming out that's just for you

2785
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
It's called Legends of Wrestlemania

2786
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
And this game is actually

2787
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Going to have wrestlemania greats

2788
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
From like the 80's

2789
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Including look at this screenshot Andre the Giant

2790
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And Hulk Hogan

2791
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
And it's going to be like a battle game

2792
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Where you can fight all these people

2793
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
And just to give you a sampling

2794
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Of the 42 characters again this is a rumor

2795
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
It's coming from NeoGaf

2796
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Those forums but hey

2797
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
You know what if you want to put together a hell of a

2798
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Wrestlemania game this sounds like a good place to start

2799
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Andre the Giant, Bam Bam Bigelow

2800
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Big Boss Man

2801
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Bret Hart

2802
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
The Hammer, Hacksaw, Hulk Hogan

2803
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Jake the Snake Roberts, Jim the Anvil

2804
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Nate Hart

2805
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
King Kong Bundy

2806
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Million Dollar Man

2807
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Mr. Fuji, Mr. Perfect, Rick Flair

2808
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Sergeant Slaughter

2809
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Stone Cold Steve Austin

2810
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Undertaker, Yokozuna I mean just tons

2811
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
The Rock of course

2812
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Just some awesome awesome

2813
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Most of which are dead

2814
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Sadly most of which are dead

2815
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
SHJ100Matt says

2816
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I played this at Comic Con it's a lot of fun

2817
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I wouldn't doubt it

2818
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
That's an ultimate fighting game right there

2819
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
That's going to be a lot of fun

2820
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Even though I'm not a big wrestlemania fan

2821
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I do remember the old school wrestlemania

2822
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
On the NES that was like one of the first

2823
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Fighting games ever

2824
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
That had like six of those characters

2825
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
In it I remember like Macho Man was in it

2826
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And Hulk and Andre

2827
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
There were like the Million Dollar Man

2828
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Had a little dollar sign he had to get

2829
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
That was a power up

2830
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
There was just these dumb little things in it

2831
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
That made it awesome

2832
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
It's kind of cool that wrestlemania lasted all this time

2833
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Didn't they just have their 25th anniversary

2834
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Or something like that?

2835
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Which one?

2836
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Wrestlemania had like a 25th anniversary or something

2837
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Just recently? I don't know they had something

2838
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
It was a big anniversary for it I know

2839
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Anyhow I'm sure somebody in chat that's a big wrestling fan

2840
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Will correct me momentarily

2841
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
WWF Wrestlefest

2842
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I thought it was Wrestlemania

2843
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Wrestlemania is the big one I'm thinking of

2844
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Well at any rate

2845
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
How about some news from

2846
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Squenix

2847
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Squenix? Sure

2848
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Well

2849
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
At any rate

2850
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
The

2851
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Playstation 2 game

2852
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Persona 4

2853
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Is going to be out in the UK

2854
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
On March 13th

2855
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And the PAL box is going to have

2856
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
A special CD

2857
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Soundtrack

2858
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
With 24 tracks

2859
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
It has a new plot

2860
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
New places to go

2861
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
New stuff to look at

2862
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
New things to kill

2863
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
New spookies

2864
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
And it is the same stylized

2865
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Manga pop culture art

2866
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
To go in the game

2867
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
So

2868
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Go check it out for when it's out

2869
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
And actually it's supposed to be

2870
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Not too far off

2871
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
From the style of Persona 3

2872
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
So

2873
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Go for it

2874
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
They're just using the same engine for Persona 3

2875
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
If I remember right

2876
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Just milking money out of it

2877
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
But hey you know what actually

2878
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
There's a lot of love out there for Persona 3

2879
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
And I haven't played it personally

2880
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
But I hear it's very in depth

2881
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And it's pretty cool

2882
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Very very cool

2883
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Well you can check it out now

2884
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's already out

2885
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
In the US at least

2886
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
At some point

2887
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Alright so

2888
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Some other cool stuff

2889
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Well actually it isn't very cool

2890
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
It's kind of typical for Nintendo

2891
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
People trying to exploit them

2892
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
For any sort of class action lawsuit

2893
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
This time it's not really related

2894
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
To wrist straps or throwing stuff through TVs

2895
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Apparently

2896
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
This guy Michael

2897
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Tortilla

2898
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Not Tortilla but Tortilla

2899
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
He's a fitness expert

2900
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
And apparently a host of some

2901
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
AMTalk radio show called

2902
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Shape Up America

2903
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And he has announced plans that he's gonna

2904
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
File a class action lawsuit against Nintendo

2905
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Claiming that they're injuring

2906
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Or that people are getting injured

2907
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Playing Wii games because

2908
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Nintendo isn't telling people to properly

2909
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Warm up before doing exercise

2910
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
He claims that

2911
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Wii Fit has led the people

2912
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Sustaining injuries in their knees

2913
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Back in risk because

2914
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Overuse of improper warm up

2915
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
And

2916
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Just

2917
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I don't know I think this is kind of a stretch

2918
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I mean that's just like saying

2919
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Oh well you know

2920
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I got up and walked down the stairs

2921
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
But my TV didn't tell me to warm up

2922
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Before I did activity

2923
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
On top of that actually

2924
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
This is something that people have been doing for years

2925
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Before you do any physical activity

2926
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
It's a good idea

2927
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Even before stretching it's a good idea

2928
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
To warm up your muscles

2929
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Before you even stretch

2930
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Or you're at risk for injury

2931
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
In the tendons and tissue

2932
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I mean that's just

2933
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Should be common sense stuff that they teach you

2934
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
When you're in school

2935
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Well I think this is kind of pointless anyways because

2936
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
The Wii games aren't necessarily

2937
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
High impact I mean

2938
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Wii sports tennis does not need

2939
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
To be high impact it doesn't sense

2940
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
You swing the

2941
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Wii mote like a tennis racket

2942
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
You know you don't have to do that

2943
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
You just have to move your wrist I mean

2944
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
That's not

2945
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Their fault it's the fault of people playing it

2946
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
That are getting way too into the game

2947
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And hurting themselves

2948
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
GS68 in the chat room has a good point

2949
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
At chat dot orange lounge radio dot com

2950
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
He says DDR doesn't tell people to stretch either

2951
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And it's been getting you know away with it

2952
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
For so so long right?

2953
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Yeah it just

2954
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It shouldn't even be a thing it's a frivolous

2955
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Lawsuit it's gonna get thrown out

2956
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
I agree and you know what frivolous lawsuits

2957
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I don't know about you guys but frivolous lawsuits

2958
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Make me angry and uh

2959
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
When we get angry here at orange lounge radio we cue

2960
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
That nasty music and say some nasty things

2961
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Music

2962
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I have two FUs

2963
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Um the first one being the internet

2964
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Connection at my house

2965
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Because of the damn wind

2966
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Which this really isn't like

2967
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Wind but unfortunately

2968
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Sacramento has no idea

2969
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
What to do when a tree moves

2970
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
To be fair California in general

2971
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Yeah

2972
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
But I mean

2973
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Plan for the fucking wind

2974
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
We get wind storms here every so often

2975
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
So just plan for it

2976
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And be prepared

2977
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
For everything constant vigilance

2978
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
And then um

2979
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
My other FU goes

2980
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Towards um

2981
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Half dot com

2982
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
The school book that I ordered

2983
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
That still hasn't arrived

2984
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
But um I will say that I don't think I got

2985
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Charged for it so

2986
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I have to go find the damn thing again

2987
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And I don't want to buy it from school

2988
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Because school is fucking expensive

2989
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I would rather

2990
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Be frugal because I have

2991
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Things that my money is better spent on

2992
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
The end

2993
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Um

2994
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Loki do you have any FUs of the week?

2995
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Yeah FU to the rain because for the second

2996
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Week now in a row it has ruined my

2997
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Plans to go airsofting

2998
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
And it's really pissing me off because

2999
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I wanted to go like weeks ago now

3000
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I have all the equipment all the ammo

3001
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Everything I'm ready to go

3002
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
And it keeps fucking raining and

3003
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It always rains like on the weekend

3004
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
It's dry through the week and then it starts

3005
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Raining and then wind and ugh

3006
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
But so now this next

3007
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Week I'm hoping to be able to go

3008
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Airsofting it might actually have to be

3009
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
That Saturday instead of Sunday morning

3010
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Which is annoying but

3011
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Actdeft in chat has a suggestion for you

3012
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
He says blame it on the rain

3013
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Yeah yeah

3014
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Forget it

3015
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Ah that's funny but right now

3016
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Um I have a feeling

3017
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Though it's gonna still be raining next week

3018
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Fucking weather yeah sure it doesn't rain

3019
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
All you know before this and now

3020
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
All of a sudden it's just like oh rain rain rain

3021
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Rain rain rain more rain

3022
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Alright well my FU of the week

3023
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Goes to having the worst Valentine's

3024
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Day ever ever

3025
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Because I was sick and I was having what you call

3026
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Horizontal day that means I was lying on the couch

3027
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
All day long so yeah made Valentine's

3028
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Day kinda suck so

3029
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
And I was just bored and lonely

3030
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And sad so

3031
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
You know I just wanted a hug is that so wrong

3032
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
But yeah Valentine's

3033
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Day sucks but what is this just another day right

3034
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Uh Dan do you have any FUs of the week real quick

3035
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Just wanted to say FU to Ryu

3036
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Keep kicking my ass

3037
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And that's about it

3038
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Alright there you have it FU to Ryu

3039
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Alright

3040
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
That's gonna do it for the FUs of the week but let's get back into some gaming

3041
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
News and guess what the lawsuit stories are

3042
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Not over that's right uh

3043
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Guess who got sued this time though it's almost

3044
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
A twist of fate you know how like

3045
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
There's this running inside joke that like

3046
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Konami will sue like you know ever

3047
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Since they sued Rockstar which I still think they

3048
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Were in the right to sue them

3049
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I agree they were totally in the right

3050
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But some of the lawsuits since then have been

3051
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
A little interesting well now

3052
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
The tables have gotten turned Konami

3053
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Got sued this week yup

3054
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
So now it's not Konami will sue it's

3055
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Konami got sued uh Viacom

3056
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
And Harmonix sued

3057
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Konami over the game

3058
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Rock Revolution they say

3059
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
That Rock Revolution violates their patents

3060
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
For musical instrument peripherals

3061
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
But wait a minute

3062
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Um didn't Konami kind of

3063
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Invent the well nevermind

3064
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Anyhow uh the complaint was

3065
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Filed this week in a federal court in

3066
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Boston which is where Harmonix is based

3067
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
The complaint wants to stop the sales of

3068
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Rock Revolution and wants cash compensation

3069
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Well please the sales were already

3070
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Stopped I don't know I don't think you need it

3071
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Done Matt done there you go

3072
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
You win congrats

3073
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Um I don't know

3074
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
But I guess well more so they probably want

3075
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Cash for it and they probably want

3076
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Uh I don't know some type of

3077
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Uh I would say you know

3078
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
It's sad to say I would say that Rock Revolution

3079
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Impacted the sale

3080
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Of Rock Band in no way whatsoever

3081
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I know for real right

3082
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
I can't say I can't honestly say there has been

3083
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
One person on the face of the earth that said

3084
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Ooh Rock Revolution that's way better than

3085
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Rock Band

3086
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
But this is so strange apparently

3087
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Even though the Viacom patent um

3088
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Says that it improved on earlier

3089
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Video game music controllers and even kind of references

3090
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Beatmania uh

3091
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
They're still but this is the weird thing

3092
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
About it Konami didn't put out

3093
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
A new guitar with this game

3094
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
They put out a new drum set

3095
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Which probably sold five of them

3096
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Unless the internals of the drum set are you know

3097
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Something similar to what's you know

3098
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Put out there but their drum set

3099
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Looked like their old drum set for Drummania

3100
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I mean it

3101
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Looked like crap and it

3102
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Apparently played like crap so I don't understand

3103
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I don't know

3104
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Other than maybe it's like well fine you

3105
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Sue us but we're gonna sue you back

3106
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
We'll sue you too

3107
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
SSJ100 Matt

3108
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
SSJ100 Matt in chat says uh

3109
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Aaron or YYR takes pride

3110
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That Snake 360 has outsold

3111
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Rock Revolution

3112
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
That's probably a true fact I wouldn't doubt that at all

3113
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I wouldn't doubt it

3114
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
He does have gut mechanics

3115
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
We got um Rufus

3116
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Rufus now fighting by the way they're saying

3117
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Justin TV's back up you might want to try to connect one more time

3118
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
On the thing then the folks can see this

3119
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
And at least the live listeners

3120
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Will get to understand what we're talking about

3121
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Even if the podcast listeners are screwed

3122
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Nope still not working

3123
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
No that's a bummer

3124
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Alright well anyhow

3125
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Yeah it'll be interesting to see how this one

3126
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Turns out I wonder if they'll settle I wonder if

3127
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Somebody's just trying to make a point I have no

3128
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Idea yeah frisbee in our chat room sums it up

3129
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Lawsuit ping pong that's

3130
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Exactly what appears to be happening here

3131
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I cannot see

3132
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
There's no case here I mean it's just

3133
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
You know it didn't affect

3134
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Their sales at all I mean

3135
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
It really the sales of rock revolution

3136
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Were so friggin poor

3137
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
That I don't see how they can say

3138
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Oh well our sales were impacted

3139
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
You know if it's guitar hero rock band

3140
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Maybe there's you know something there but

3141
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And I know it seems like we're always

3142
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Siding with Konami on this show but

3143
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
You know don't take that too

3144
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Much because honestly we're just saying

3145
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
That having to put your name on

3146
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Rock revolution was punishment enough

3147
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I mean it's not good

3148
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
You know financial

3149
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Liability I don't think

3150
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Is warranted but what do I know I'm not a judge

3151
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I mean I can say maybe that

3152
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
They I don't think they

3153
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Do they have vocals in rock revolution

3154
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I don't think they did I don't think they're the

3155
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Actual songs I think they're

3156
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Oh yeah no you don't sing along I think it's

3157
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
All cover bands

3158
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So

3159
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Hell I don't know

3160
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Whatever it's what the point it's what's the

3161
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Point the game yeah

3162
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Something like that well here's something that our

3163
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
World of warcraft listeners will be more interested in

3164
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Yay

3165
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Have you actually gone back to play

3166
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Not yet but what you're about to tell us might

3167
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I'm very proud of you

3168
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Oh my god it's still moving

3169
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Sorry I'm very proud of you

3170
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
If you've resisted the urge

3171
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I have it's been like three weeks now

3172
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Ooh tap that vein

3173
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Well

3174
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
There's more about the dual talent

3175
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Stuff in case

3176
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
You were interested

3177
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Um you know the dual talent

3178
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Spec system is coming out in the game

3179
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Um

3180
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
And it's going to have

3181
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
It to where you can switch

3182
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Your characters between your

3183
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Customization setups

3184
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
One for rating one for pvp

3185
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
And possibly one you know

3186
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Between you know one for healing and one for

3187
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
For damaging

3188
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Um the option is only going to be available

3189
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Um

3190
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
If once you have hit

3191
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Level 80 first

3192
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And um

3193
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Basically the reason

3194
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Is um according to

3195
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Greg Street who is uh

3196
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Ghostcrawler

3197
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
That they didn't want to make the game more complex

3198
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
For lower levels who are still trying to learn

3199
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Their class

3200
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Um but there

3201
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
He said if it proves popular then they will

3202
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Consider expanding it

3203
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
She'll basically pay a one time fee

3204
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Um to your in game

3205
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Class trainer

3206
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
To access your dual specs and after

3207
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
That you can switch between

3208
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Um the two at any lexicon

3209
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Of power in any city

3210
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Um

3211
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Also if you

3212
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Have the inscription profession

3213
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
You can sell portable lexicon

3214
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Of power that will require

3215
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
A group of players to summon and use

3216
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Anywhere but during combat

3217
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Or in arena

3218
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
So nice

3219
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
So you can switch roles in the middle

3220
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Of a raid

3221
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Basically like if you need

3222
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
For instance I'm thinking in Naxxramas

3223
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
You can get through most of the um

3224
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Event with just two healers but it's really

3225
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Nice to have a third healer

3226
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
For four horsemen so just imagine

3227
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Before you engage four horsemen okay let's summon

3228
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
The lexicon of power and we're going to have our druid

3229
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Switch from uh Boomkin to resto I mean that's

3230
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
That's going to be a that's going to change

3231
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
The dynamics big time

3232
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Well with the specs themselves

3233
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
You'll get um the dual setup

3234
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
With your action bars and your glyphs

3235
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
That will just switch automatically

3236
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
When you change over to the other spec

3237
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Um

3238
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
There will also be a gear manager

3239
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
That will allow you to change between

3240
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Your equippable items

3241
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Um for or you know

3242
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Whether they be individual

3243
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Or entire equipment sets

3244
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Between the two specs

3245
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
So

3246
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So it's it seems pretty complex

3247
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Um

3248
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
But they're actually saying that it's

3249
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Going to be on the public test server soon

3250
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
But not immediately

3251
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Available um

3252
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
And that the gear it they said though

3253
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
That it would be starting off with

3254
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Possibly the next content patch

3255
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
But the gear manager is not going to be

3256
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Um at the same time it'll fall later

3257
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Yeah it'll probably

3258
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
It'll probably be a little while before we actually see this

3259
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Go into the game but I think they're doing the

3260
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Star patch is what 3.1

3261
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And so that's probably when we'll start seeing

3262
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Dual specing but the gear thing will probably

3263
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Be a little while so

3264
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
There you go and uh

3265
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
The chat

3266
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
The chat is uh making fun

3267
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Of me for knowing exactly all this

3268
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
WoW talk and all that

3269
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I was sitting here wondering if you were speaking another language

3270
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Oh shut up

3271
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Somewhere out there there are listeners of this

3272
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Program that play WoW that understand perfectly

3273
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Well what I just said

3274
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
There are some people who quit

3275
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Who understand what you're talking about

3276
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
There you go there you go

3277
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Alright so then we better talk about another gamer

3278
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm going to get right back on the WoW bandwagon

3279
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Luckily I have Street Fighter 4

3280
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
To ogle over and Dan is right now on the last boss

3281
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Seth who looks like um

3282
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
He looks like the glowing guy

3283
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
From the Watchmen trailers to me

3284
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
That's what he looks like

3285
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Uh yeah and he's a cheap bastard

3286
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
That has like the um specials

3287
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
From a whole bunch of different characters

3288
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Um I don't know

3289
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
This is not Doral

3290
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Thank you Tigerclaw

3291
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Doctor Manhattan that's what I was trying to think of

3292
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
He looks like Doctor Manhattan to me

3293
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
He also has very um

3294
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Abnormal muscles

3295
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
In a true anatomical sense

3296
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
He ate a spinning ying yang

3297
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
No no no no I'm talking about

3298
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
He has got like um

3299
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Going down from a solar plexus

3300
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
In between his ribs

3301
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
To between his major abdominals

3302
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
He's got a whole ridge of like

3303
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Bonus muscles

3304
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
That don't exist

3305
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Sorry I noticed this stuff

3306
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I'm just messing

3307
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Alright sorry Loki

3308
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
He's got extra muscles in his ass

3309
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Anyways

3310
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
There's a game coming out on

3311
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
PC and

3312
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
In April and possibly

3313
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Well in the PS3 I guess in

3314
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Quarter 3 this year

3315
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Free Realms it's a free mmo RPG

3316
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
And it's uh I guess

3317
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Kinda geared towards kids

3318
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And uh you will be able to play it for free

3319
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
On the Playstation Network

3320
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Um whenever that happens to come out

3321
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
So that's kinda neat

3322
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
And it's um I guess

3323
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I don't know if it's gonna be I'm assuming

3324
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
It's one of those free to play but you have to

3325
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Pay for upgrade type you know things

3326
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
But uh hey free's good I guess

3327
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
It doesn't look that bad

3328
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,000
But I don't know I haven't really played it

3329
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Well okay then

3330
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Well Street Fighter 4

3331
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Mania is sweeping not just

3332
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
The US but Japan and

3333
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
When do I say Mania I mean

3334
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Mania 86,000

3335
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Copies sold in the first day alone

3336
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
In Japan and if that doesn't

3337
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Sound like a lot of copies you need to

3338
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Understand this they are sold out in

3339
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Japan you can't find this game in Japan right now

3340
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
86,000 was the first pressing

3341
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And uh it's gone

3342
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Uh apparently they are gonna try and crank some more

3343
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Of these guys out as fast as they can but uh

3344
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Right now they're like Nintendo Wii's

3345
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Trying to find these guys

3346
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Not easy I wonder if the same thing

3347
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Is gonna happen over here in the US I don't think fighting games

3348
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Are as big here but I

3349
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Definitely think this is the type of thing that you're probably

3350
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Gonna be hoping you had a pre-order for

3351
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Or you're gonna have to run to Best Buy when they open or

3352
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
The stores that don't do actually even Best Buy does pre-orders now

3353
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Huh who doesn't do pre-orders

3354
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Circuit City well look what happened to them

3355
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Kmart doesn't do pre-orders so you'll have to run

3356
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
To Kmart at noon that's true if you ever want to get

3357
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
A game on launch day go to Kmart because no one

3358
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Shops at Kmart if you remember the old

3359
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Orange launch radio piece of advice

3360
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
No one shops at Kmart

3361
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Actually I shop at Kmart now

3362
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
You know why? Because the target

3363
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Right over here by the house

3364
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Is closed for remodeling till October

3365
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
They're turning into an Uber

3366
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Target or whatever

3367
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Yeah I think it's turning into a Greatland

3368
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
So the target is closed

3369
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
For the foreseeable future

3370
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
And I will not go to Walmart

3371
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
So and

3372
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
The other target Greatland is kind of a ways away

3373
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Why won't you go to Walmart? I'll just go to

3374
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Because it's dirty in its ghetto

3375
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Well that's because it's the Rancho Cambodia

3376
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Walmart because it makes you hate humanity

3377
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
For real

3378
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
So I would rather go to Kmart honestly

3379
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
So there you go

3380
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
How's that for some rule reversal?

3381
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Misty says hey I shop at Kmart right after Christmas

3382
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Got some cute jeans

3383
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
There you go

3384
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
They came from the 80s?

3385
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Are the jeans bedazzled

3386
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
In the back

3387
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
That type of 80s style

3388
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
No they're stonewashed

3389
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Rob

3390
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
They're acid washed

3391
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Nice

3392
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Alright

3393
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Can we move on?

3394
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Why am I actually explaining

3395
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
The difference between Target and Target Greatland

3396
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Greatland has more shopping

3397
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
I'm not even being paid

3398
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
More grocery shopping

3399
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Not a full grocery store

3400
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
It's like a Super Walmart without being awesome

3401
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Without the produce and without the beef

3402
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Anyhow sorry

3403
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I'm done with Street Fighter IV

3404
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Did you want to talk about the next game Dark Sakura?

3405
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Well

3406
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
How about some Star Trek Online

3407
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
How about it?

3408
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
We were talking about the character trailer last week

3409
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
And it's pretty

3410
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
They're saying the O.L.Aureans

3411
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
The official alien race

3412
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Of Orange Dodge Radio and yes

3413
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
They are orange

3414
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Well maybe

3415
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
But they're actually saying

3416
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
There will not

3417
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Be

3418
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Any famous

3419
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Star Trek personas

3420
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Available in Star Trek Online

3421
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
They're basically saying

3422
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
It's in the future where the majority of the

3423
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Known characters have passed

3424
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
On except for the ones that are robots

3425
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Holograms, ghosts

3426
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Etc, etc

3427
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Or Spock

3428
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So we could see data?

3429
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
No he died

3430
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Oh that's right

3431
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Damn it

3432
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I don't remember

3433
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Ok trackies help me out

3434
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
What happened to Lure?

3435
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I think he got disassembled

3436
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
There's always more of them

3437
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I want Q

3438
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I want there to be a freaking Q mission

3439
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
And I want a Q mission

3440
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Ok

3441
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
However they have actually

3442
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Been talking to

3443
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Some

3444
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Other folks

3445
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
And

3446
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
They don't really

3447
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I don't think they've ruled it out

3448
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Cryptocast hasn't ruled it out

3449
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
It's not likely

3450
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Although who knows what might happen

3451
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
With those transporter accidents

3452
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Oh Dan's

3453
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Bringing out the big guns

3454
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Dan is still trying to fight the last boss

3455
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Of the game and is having trouble

3456
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
He's a cheap bitch

3457
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
It's why he can't beat him

3458
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
It's massive jaw

3459
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Did Seth suck you in

3460
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
His stomach and then shoot you out?

3461
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Because that's what it looked like in that one part

3462
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
That's disgusting

3463
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
It's massive jaw

3464
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Versus person with

3465
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Who's been taking too much collodial silver

3466
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
You know that turned you blue for real

3467
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Wow

3468
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
You're a chemistry nerd

3469
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I'm not I just happen to know that because

3470
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I have an odd interest in skin diseases

3471
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Right we're going to get to the mailbag here soon

3472
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
But a couple more stories for you first

3473
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Well guess what there's a new artist coming to

3474
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Rock band

3475
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Is it someone good?

3476
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
No it's not Miley Cyrus

3477
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Danny Minogue

3478
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It's Snoop Dogg

3479
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Just when I think of

3480
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Rock band I think of Snoop Dogg

3481
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Yes Snoop Dogg

3482
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
He is coming to Rock band

3483
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Download content

3484
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
No word on what

3485
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Songs they're actually going to put in Rock band

3486
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
But I don't know many of them

3487
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
That are rock-ish

3488
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I don't know

3489
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Who cares let's just play Gin and Juice

3490
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Act deaf says

3491
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Faux shizzle

3492
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
You want to go riding with the homies

3493
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Wasn't that Coolio?

3494
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Coolio is rolling with the homies

3495
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Coolioer

3496
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Sorry

3497
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Please tell me there's some other bands

3498
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
That make more sense for Rock band

3499
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Yeah there's some other stuff coming too

3500
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
White Zombie

3501
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Which makes me happy

3502
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
There's two songs from White Zombie

3503
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Black Sunshine and More Human Than Human

3504
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
More Human Than Human

3505
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I love that song

3506
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Wasted Again by Turbo Negro

3507
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Those are coming this week to

3508
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Rock band

3509
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
The only bad thing about White Zombie is they really make me want to break things

3510
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Like when I listen to their music

3511
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Don't you want to break stuff?

3512
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
No but

3513
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Going back to the whole

3514
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Hip-Hop artists being in Rock band

3515
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
There was actually a remix of

3516
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Some

3517
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Not Tupac

3518
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Some actual

3519
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Puff Daddy song

3520
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
I think that was

3521
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
They did a Rock version of

3522
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
That would be pretty

3523
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Fit for Rock band although I think it's kind of old

3524
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I remember seeing this back when I was playing

3525
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Qzar

3526
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Years ago

3527
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
You know what song I'm surprised they haven't put in there?

3528
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Is the Public Enemy Anthrax

3529
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Bring the Noise

3530
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Where is that?

3531
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Or I was going to suggest

3532
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
The Run DMC in Aerosmith

3533
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
But that was actually in the Aerosmith

3534
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Guitar Hero wasn't it?

3535
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
That was in Guitar Hero Aerosmith

3536
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
We need actual rocking out

3537
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
We need Anthrax

3538
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Anthrax and Public Enemy

3539
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I still say we need GWAR

3540
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
We need GWAR

3541
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
GWAR

3542
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
We need Rock band GWAR

3543
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Or Rob Zombie

3544
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I'd be good with Rob Zombie even though White Zombie

3545
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
They have some Rob Zombie

3546
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Anyhow

3547
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Let's do some more news

3548
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I have one more story here

3549
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
It's about G.I. Joe

3550
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Naturally they're making a game

3551
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Out of the new movie

3552
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Which I'm sure a lot of folks saw

3553
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
It's coming out soon

3554
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
EA was actually showing off the game

3555
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
At the little convention that was going on

3556
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Apparently MTV blog

3557
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Actually interviewed

3558
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
The folks behind the G.I. Joe game and found out

3559
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Knowing is half the battle

3560
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
PSAs

3561
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
They're going to be in the game

3562
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
If you do well as you play the G.I. Joe game

3563
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
You will unlock vintage

3564
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Educational clips

3565
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Where G.I. Joe comes out and does

3566
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
This little spiel and says

3567
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
And now you know and knowing is half the battle

3568
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
So that's pretty amazing

3569
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So awesome

3570
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Now you have a reason to get this

3571
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
If you don't have them all

3572
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
On Beta Max tape or something like that

3573
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I don't know

3574
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Anyhow let's take a minute

3575
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
To open up the old mail bag

3576
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And see what you guys have to say

3577
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Every week you guys email us

3578
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
At mailbagorangelaunchradio.com

3579
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
We rip open the email bag

3580
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And see what you guys have to say

3581
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Nothing no mail

3582
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
That's a lie I saw at least three in there earlier

3583
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
There's three

3584
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Sup lords of O.L.R

3585
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
As you maybe know

3586
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I listened and wrote this

3587
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Misg

3588
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
On my iTouch

3589
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Last Sunday I wept because

3590
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I tried to listen live on allgames.com

3591
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
But it didn't work

3592
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
FOUNTY FACE

3593
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
How can you guys broadcast live to iTouch

3594
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
And hell even PSP listeners

3595
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Other than that I told you I got

3596
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Endwar last week

3597
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
And beat it in five hours and lied to Blockbuster

3598
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
About it being broken

3599
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
LOL I'm just cheap like that

3600
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
The game was basically Company of Heroes

3601
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
On the PC with mic support

3602
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Which was state of the art

3603
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
And worked

3604
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
My brother just picked up four kickass games today

3605
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Random capitalization

3606
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
And this weekend is gonna kickass too

3607
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
The games were

3608
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Gears of War 2, GTA 4,

3609
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Rainbow Six, Vegas 2, and Lost Planet

3610
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I've got an ass ton

3611
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Of games to play

3612
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I'll tell you what I thought of them next time

3613
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Until the next email you hear from me

3614
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Goodbye

3615
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
This is from RJ

3616
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Um

3617
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I am gonna say this

3618
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Given how much texting I do

3619
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
On my iPhone

3620
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
It is possible to

3621
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Capitalize and use proper grammar

3622
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
And spell shit correctly

3623
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Especially when it fixes it for you

3624
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Other than that

3625
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Really the only way

3626
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
To really listen to the podcast

3627
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Through your

3628
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
iPod or iPhone

3629
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Is gonna be

3630
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
To download the

3631
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Podcast

3632
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
We don't have it available live

3633
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
And the PSP is the

3634
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I thought we had a live player on PSP

3635
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
We do, you have to be on

3636
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
The PSP to see it though

3637
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
So yeah

3638
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
You gotta

3639
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Next email

3640
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Um

3641
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Rini here

3642
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
With greetings to the three hosts

3643
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
And Ferret

3644
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
He says hello as well

3645
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
I'd like to

3646
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Take this particular email to hype a game

3647
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
It's not necessarily

3648
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
About the gameplay itself but more the

3649
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Experience

3650
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
I initially meant this towards Sky and Dark Sakura

3651
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Loki may not get it

3652
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
But he may be mildly amused

3653
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
But I thought oh well let's get your listeners in this

3654
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Before I say the name of the game

3655
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I'd like to ask for any chat room listeners

3656
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Who have played it to not spoil

3657
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Anything about the game

3658
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I guess that was in caps so I screamed it

3659
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Thank you

3660
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
The name of the game is Aversion

3661
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
To compel everyone to play this simple

3662
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Game here are a few reasons

3663
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
It's free and played on your PC

3664
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
With low system requirements

3665
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
It's two hours

3666
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
It's a platformer but it's not very hard

3667
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
And lastly it's cute with a secret

3668
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Oooh Navy Seals

3669
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
And again it's meant to be

3670
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
An experience

3671
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
And worth it for the true ending

3672
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
And there are two endings

3673
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Here's the link for everyone

3674
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000

Hold on

3680
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Rob

3681
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Sorry

3682
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I'm dying here

3683
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
And

3684
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
They're doing other things

3685
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
He's

3686
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
He's working on Disney TV

3687
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Because it says it's working but it's not working

3688
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
It's the

3689
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Phantom working

3690
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
See Seth

3691
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
Is a cheap bastard

3692
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
You know

3693
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
The first round you can hand him

3694
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
He's like oh I suck

3695
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
And then the second round he's like eh you're dead

3696
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
And they're like well you might win

3697
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Aw

3698
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
See that's why you have to switch it to one round

3699
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Per battle and then

3700
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
The first round he was like

3701
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I can't even fight

3702
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I'm like yeah

3703
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Alright

3704
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Extra credit to Sky

3705
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
If he'll make a video of himself playing the game blind

3706
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Never playing it before

3707
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Not literally blind

3708
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Now I'm going to poke his eyes out

3709
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
With audio commentary and uploading it to the neglected

3710
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
OLR YouTube channel

3711
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Just saying

3712
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Although it's not worth it if someone doesn't

3713
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Make sense of the proper reaction

3714
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
And a random question

3715
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Will OLR support the DSI with podcasts

3716
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
In AAC format

3717
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
For those too lazy to

3718
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Lazy to confront them from MP3

3719
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I'll give you the generic answer

3720
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Maybe

3721
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Thank you for your response

3722
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
You're welcome for your response

3723
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
This email brought to you by the Mirror Room from Silent Hill 3

3724
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
With a weird

3725
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Scrunchy face

3726
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Last email

3727
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Mike

3728
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
In Australia again

3729
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Hey

3730
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Just wanted to say thank you to Rob

3731
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
And All In Chat a fortnight ago

3732
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
That recommended Chrono Trigger

3733
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Although it's not a game I generally

3734
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Would play I got the game on

3735
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Rob's and the OLR's recommendation

3736
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
And have been really enjoying it

3737
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Might have to try Super Metroid if Rob picked it as

3738
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
The number one game above Chrono Trigger

3739
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Hey

3740
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
If there's

3741
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
If there's any

3742
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Other DS games you can recommend

3743
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Regardless of type of game

3744
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
I would like to hear your suggestions

3745
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Hope everyone in the OLR world

3746
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Is doing well and look forward to getting the podcast

3747
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Updated soon. Thanks Mike

3748
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Um

3749
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Well I know I've

3750
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Said this is Castlevania Order

Of Ecclesia is a lot of

3752
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Fun

3753
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
I do really like Cooking Mama

3754
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Um

3755
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
There is

3756
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Of course the western

02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Release Elite Beat agents you can maybe

3758
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Find Osutetaki, Oendan

3759
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Or Oendan 2

3760
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
From Japan

3761
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Um

3762
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
There's a number of good RPGs out though

3763
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
I mean there's just a bunch of really good

3764
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Games out there

3765
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Um

3766
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
But I do um

3767
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I do totally recommend

3768
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Order of Ecclesia I mean if you really want to know

3769
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
What I'm playing

3770
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I'm grabbing my DS case

3771
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Right now while Rob

3772
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Is fixing Justin TV and I'll let you

3773
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Know what the hell's in it right now

3774
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Let me grab this

3775
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Monstrosity of a case

3776
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Right there

3777
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Uh which of course half of them fell down and

3778
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Sorry if you hear the random noises

3779
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I'm trying to fix Justin TV I'm not having much luck

3780
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Though

3781
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I think I just lost a game in your couch Rob

3782
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
I think us trying to upgrade

3783
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
The encoder thing

3784
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Woo hoo! Dan finally did it

3785
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Broke Justin TV so I don't know

3786
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
With Dan! Dan beat Seth with Dan

3787
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Nice

3788
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
And of course right as

3789
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Dan beats the game

3790
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
With Dan

3791
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I can't get stupid Justin TV to work

3792
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I'm pissed

3793
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
If I meet someone named Seth I'm just gonna punch him in the face

3794
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Oh I think I know why

3795
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Because

3796
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Well anyway the games that are currently in

3797
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
My um case at this point in time

3798
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Um and then maybe this will

3799
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Give you an idea

3800
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Yes

3801
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000

3802
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000

Oh my god spoilers

02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
And um Doctor Who

3820
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Top Trumps from um

3821
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
The UK which given that you're in Australia

3822
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I'm sure that you won't have a problem

3823
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Getting that so that's what's currently

3824
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
In my uh

3825
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
System right now

3826
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
So maybe that'll give you some ideas

3827
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Um by the way

3828
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I want to go back since I was futzing with Justin

3829
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
TV I wanted to kind of correct one thing one listener

3830
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Was saying and that was about um being able to listen

3831
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
To Orange Lawn's radio on your iPhone

3832
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Oh here's the other game

3833
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
You actually can listen live you have to use an app like

3834
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Tuner um tuner is what I use that's a pay

3835
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
App but I know there's a free one as well

3836
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Out there that you can use to tune in to like

3837
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
All games radio when we're live on Sunday night

3838
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
So you can listen on the phone iPhone

3839
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Just like you can on the PSP I just wanted to uh

3840
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Correct that uh the other game that's in here

3841
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
The one that I lost to your couch

3842
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Yes the world ends with you

3843
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Oh you don't want to lose I mean you do want to lose that one

3844
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
On my couch no I don't Rob

3845
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Woohoo

3846
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Alright

3847
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
So anywho I'm just looking at the new website

3848
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
The OL Army Picks and I finally see the

3849
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Asakura vs Dan that's not the greatest quality

3850
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Though if Justin TV stays down

3851
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
We'll try to make a YouTube after the show

3852
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Um of like a

3853
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Ten minute review of Street Fighter IV

3854
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Maybe that can be a fun thing we can do

3855
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I don't know Loki's trying to work like mad to get Justin TV back up

3856
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
We'll see what happens

3857
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Anyhow meanwhile if that does it for the mailbag

3858
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
I'm going to say send us more mail

3859
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com

3860
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Also if I'm not over

3861
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
This by next week someone else is reading

3862
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Mailbag

3863
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Alright we'll see I can always do that I guess

3864
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
If my cold goes away

3865
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Loki uh we've got some couple more news stories

3866
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
And we're going to open up the skype line at

3867
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
2007 game OLR not just yet almost there

3868
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Couple more news stories for you guys

3869
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Yeah

3870
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Um anyways

3871
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
So there's um an interesting

3872
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Lawsuit taking place here

3873
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Or about to take place

3874
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Apparently Activision is threatening

3875
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
EA with a lawsuit over

3876
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Brutal Legends

3877
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
And Activision is saying that

3878
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Um

3879
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Basically that you know even though they

3880
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Abandoned the publishing rights

3881
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
You know

3882
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
That somehow they're you know do some money

3883
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
It doesn't make any sense actually

3884
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
If you think about it but um

3885
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Apparently

3886
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
You know uh you know after the merger

3887
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
With Vinvidi because they were originally going to

3888
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Purchase or publish Brutal Legends

3889
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Um you know Activision didn't

3890
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Bring it on because they wanted to keep their core franchises

3891
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Like Spyro

3892
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
And Crash

3893
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
God

3894
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Anyways stuff that they can make you know multiple

3895
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Um releases for

3896
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Well EA picked it up and now you know

3897
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Activision wants money

3898
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
So I don't get how that's possible

3899
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
But okay

3900
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Um and it's actually funny because um

3901
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
EA had put out a comment too about it

3902
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
As well

3903
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Regarding the whole Brutal Legends

3904
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Thing they um attributed

3905
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
To it's like um

3906
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
You know we doubt Activision would try

3907
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
To sue that would be like a husband

3908
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Abandoning his family and then suing

3909
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
After his wife meets a better looking guy

3910
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
That's the most awesome

3911
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Comparison I've ever heard but I mean it makes

3912
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
You know what they're saying makes sense it's kind of like

3913
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Well you guys didn't want to put out this game so

3914
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
We're giving them an outlet and now you're saying

3915
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
No you can't do it

3916
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
It's weird

3917
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I mean they want money

3918
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
They do but then why won't they just put out the game

3919
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Because they're afraid of

3920
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Someone else making money I don't it's weird

3921
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
The whole thing's weird

3922
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Yeah basically saying that they were still in talks with

3923
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Them about putting out the game

3924
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Well too bad or is that

3925
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
One of the things that's like oh well shit

3926
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
If it's going to be such a big deal maybe we should

3927
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Put out this game after all

3928
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Well yeah exactly it's like

3929
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Oh well we were in talks you know but

3930
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
That's like saying you know I was about to buy

3931
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
A car and some guy you know I've been dicking

3932
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Around oh I'm looking around at some other

3933
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Things I may buy that car I'll let

3934
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
You know and then some guy comes in and buys a car

3935
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
I'm not going to go sue the guy because

3936
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
He bought my car if you

3937
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Stop dicking around for it you know and you

3938
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Didn't think that you thought that Spyro

3939
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Would do a lot better than this

3940
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Which I can tell you right now when they

3941
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Made that announcement originally I was like

3942
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Are you fucking kidding me that they're going to drop

3943
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Ghostbusters and

3944
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
You know Brutal Legend because they want

3945
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Spyro and Crash

3946
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
What?

3947
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
So in other words stop dicking around Activision

3948
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Stop being retarded

3949
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
You know what big fucking whoop

3950
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Oh no now you can't sell Brutal Legend

3951
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
You know what it's not going to break you

3952
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
You've got like 50,000 Guitar Hero

3953
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Games coming out you've got Call of Duty

3954
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
What's your problem you have plenty

3955
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Of IPs that are coming out that are going to be

3956
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Successful just get over it

3957
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Alright our old buddy Bobby wants to make a point here

3958
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says

3959
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Activision doesn't want to publish it but they want the money for it

3960
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Like they got from Atari for Ghostbusters and Riddick

3961
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Yeah Atari paid Activision

3962
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
For the rights to publish the game

3963
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
EA is not paying Activision to publish Brutal Legend

3964
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
EA is not that beat down yet

3965
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
It'll be interesting to see what comes of this

3966
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
We'll see

3967
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Sadly the person that's going to get hurt here

3968
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
The folks behind Brutal Legend

3969
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Including the same gentleman who is responsible for Psychonauts

3970
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Bummer

3971
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
It'll get published

3972
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Eventually

3973
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
It was never going to be a big hit

3974
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I hate to tell you this it's a

3975
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
It's a niche-y title

3976
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
It's not going to sell a gajillion copies

3977
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Of Activision passed on it

3978
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
But I mean

3979
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
The thing is you got to go

3980
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
You got to go with the

3981
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Safe titles

3982
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
And then you got to go with the titles that are

3983
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Going to get you some acclaim

3984
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
And EA is kind of learning that

3985
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Because they went from doing

3986
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
All the safe bets

3987
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
All the time and everybody was like

3988
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Fuck EA

3989
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Their games are horrible

3990
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I mean what else can they spew out of

3991
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And crap and then they started bringing out

3992
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
All these great games like

3993
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Dead Space and Mirrors Edge

3994
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
And

3995
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
These games that have kind of more

3996
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Limited audiences but

3997
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
You know they're getting EA some

3998
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Recognition as hey

3999
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I remember when EA could make a game

4000
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I freaking sold a copy

4001
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Of Mirrors Edge last week practically

4002
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I remember Matt was here last week

4003
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
We played the demo after the show and he totally

4004
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Was like oh I got to get this game this is awesome

4005
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I was like I sold a copy of Mirrors Edge

4006
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Where's my sales money

4007
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
It's a fantastic game and

4008
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
You know they're going to build new

4009
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Franchises and Activision sold

4010
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Their future franchises

4011
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
For old tired franchises

4012
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
That

4013
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Aren't with the developers that made them famous

4014
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Anymore and are pieces of

4015
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Crap you know Crash

4016
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Is done I mean yeah

4017
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Every Crash game is going to sell

4018
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
250,000 copies

4019
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Consistent the kids know the brand

4020
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
I sold a Crash game the other day

4021
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
It hurt my heart but you know

4022
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Crash of the titans

4023
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Boy that's family entertainment

4024
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
You know but you look at like

4025
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
This Ghostbusters game which has had

4026
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Screenshots out for like what a year

4027
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I have demo discs saying that I could get it last

4028
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
October it looked great

4029
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Then and

4030
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Atari I think is going to have a

4031
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Hit on their hands that they need and

4032
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Maybe they can break out of that

4033
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
You know yeah we make Dragon Ball Z

4034
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
And it keeps us in business

4035
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
That they've been in for the last few years

4036
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Yeah

4037
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Black Wolf brings up a good point it still has the

4038
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Ghostbusters lanyards from PAX

4039
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
All of us that went to Penny Arcade Expo are lanyards

4040
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Were Ghostbusters games

4041
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
That was like the day before they pulled the plug on it

4042
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
You know and really Activision

4043
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Just for whatever reason they sent out the nicest

4044
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Little Ghostbusters pre-sell

4045
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Kit it came with an Ecto-1

4046
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
License plate that I shanked

4047
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
It came with Ghostbusters lanyards

4048
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
A demo disc a t-shirt

4049
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I mean it was a nice little kit and the box

4050
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Looked like a trap

4051
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
And it had like goo

4052
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Oozing out and it says do not open until

4053
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
October 2008

4054
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
It was pretty sick you know you gotta wonder

4055
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
It's just like why put all that energy into it and then just be like

4056
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Oh yeah we got Blizzard on our side now

4057
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
F this game

4058
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I mean Activision published Ghostbusters

4059
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Back in the day for the NES

4060
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
And the Sega and the Commodore

4061
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
And they figured it would be you know poetic

4062
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
That they're gonna carry it on

4063
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
No not so much

4064
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
We're gonna just let it go

4065
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
It's kinda weird

4066
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
It'll sell it'll be just like

4067
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Psychonauts where it'll be that game

4068
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Nobody buys when it comes out except for the enlightened few

4069
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
The unwashed masses

4070
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Don't understand it won't get it

4071
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
And then it'll be expensive on the secondary market

4072
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
As somebody who wants to be newly hardcore

4073
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Figures out that it's out there

4074
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And has to get their hands on it

4075
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
You know

4076
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
It'll be one of those titles

4077
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Alright

4078
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Well we got one more news story for you guys

4079
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
And we're gonna open up the skype line

4080
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Take some quick calls at 1877 game OLR

4081
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
username on skype orange lounge radio

4082
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
And it's about the Beatles game that's coming out later this year

4083
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
This

4084
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
It's not Rock Band Beatles

4085
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
It's just the Beatles that will probably look a lot like

4086
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Rock Band

4087
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Well finally we have some insight as to what this game might be like

4088
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
It's from an interview with Entertainment Weekly

4089
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
It's Paul McCartney

4090
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Actually has talked about the Beatles music game

4091
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Saying 45 Beatles songs will be in this game

4092
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
From different periods of the Beatles histories

4093
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Including early days tracks

4094
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Liverpool, Psychedelic

4095
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
And on from there

4096
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Because you know McCartney really knows what this game is all about

4097
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
He's probably right down there

4098
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
With the dev team jamming out on the plastic guitar

4099
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
You know what though

4100
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
He probably has him and George Harrison

4101
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Probably have control and Yoko

4102
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Has control over everything

4103
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Oh they got mad control

4104
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I mean this game like every pixel that goes out on this game

4105
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Has to be signed off by Yoko Ono

4106
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Yeah they got mad control

4107
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I'm sure these are gonna give you you know

4108
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Deep compelling you know gameplay tidbits

4109
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
You know what though this could be

4110
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
This could be pretty awesome

4111
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I mean the Beatles

4112
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Oh this is necessary

4113
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
This is so necessary

4114
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Next to Rock Band Journey

4115
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
This is the most important title they could possibly do

4116
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Nope

4117
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
I made a bad faux pas George is the one that's dead

4118
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I meant Ringo Starr not George Harrison

4119
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
George Harrison has control from hell

4120
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Ringo's got nothing

4121
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
And actually it's you know

4122
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Yoko

4123
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Yoko's got all the power

4124
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
McCartney's got all the money

4125
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
And Ringo's like I was a Beatle once

4126
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Sorry about that

4127
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
That's alright

4128
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Your British accent is probably better than mine

4129
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
But anyway yeah

4130
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
This is a game that's very very necessary

4131
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Because like what

4132
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
There hasn't been a big

4133
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Beatles thing for this generation

4134
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
You know what I mean

4135
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
These kids today

4136
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Don't have anything to respect the Beatles with

4137
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
If that makes any sense

4138
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Well I had a conversation the other day

4139
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
With actually a couple people

4140
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
And over the course of like two weeks

4141
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I talked to two people about

4142
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
What do the Beatles mean anymore

4143
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
And obviously

4144
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
We're all old enough

4145
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
With probably the exception of my lovely wife

4146
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Who's you know a young

4147
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
We're all old enough

4148
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Just giving you some credit there

4149
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
She's 26 doesn't look a day over 22

4150
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Old enough to realize that

4151
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
The Beatles mean something

4152
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
It's not that we were

4153
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Listening to the Beatles

4154
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Avidly you know when we got into

4155
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Whatever was our popular music

4156
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
But you know we knew that the Beatles

4157
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Were super important to our parents

4158
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
They were super important to music

4159
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
And everybody we listened to would claim the Beatles as an influence

4160
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Right it trickled down

4161
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
And we knew that the Beatles were important

4162
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
What do today's

4163
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Music listeners

4164
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Today's 14 year old what do they know about the Beatles

4165
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Pretty much what they hear from the older

4166
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Generation or just that

4167
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
There's the fashion fad going around again

4168
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
You know they have the

4169
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
You know merchandising happening again

4170
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I mean but really

4171
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
They

4172
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
This is one thing that I'd actually like to consider

4173
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Is that our time we don't really know

4174
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
War

4175
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
On the scale of what was going on

4176
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
During that time listen to me

4177
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
We don't know war of that type

4178
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
We don't have people being

4179
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Drafted and forced to go into a war

4180
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
That they don't believe in

4181
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
We don't have

4182
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
You know being stuck in such

4183
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
And true we do have

4184
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
The religious right trying to

4185
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Keep us in that phase

4186
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
But we're going from a time of completely

4187
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Stodgy

4188
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Everyone's the same into complete

4189
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Individualism and the you know

4190
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
A massive revolution

4191
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
We're not talking the message

4192
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
We're talking the music and the band

4193
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
The music is the message

4194
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Just strictly

4195
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
What do kids today know about

4196
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
The Beatles and I'm not trying to diss on the Beatles

4197
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
I'm not trying to diss on today's kids

4198
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I'm really just trying to make the

4199
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Point that they're not really

4200
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
So much into

4201
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
The Beatles I mean it's

4202
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Definitely an example of gaming skewer towards

4203
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Skewing towards the older demographic but

4204
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
It's like yeah it's gonna bust

4205
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
You know maybe some younger

4206
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Players some Rockman players into the Beatles

4207
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
But I mean this is a huge deal

4208
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I mean everyone's making the fucking

4209
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
World of how important this is

4210
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
You can't even get the Beatles on iTunes

4211
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Cause the control over the library is that tight

4212
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
But what is this really gonna mean to your

4213
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Average guitar hero Rockman player

4214
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
You can't get it on iTunes

4215
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Because of the big spat between

4216
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Apple computer and Apple

4217
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Core

4218
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
But you know

4219
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I don't think it's gonna matter cause I think everybody's

4220
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Parents are gonna buy it I think all these kids

4221
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
I think the parents are all gonna

4222
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Buy this stuff up and even some of the kids

4223
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Although I gotta say though a lot of you know

4224
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
You said earlier a lot of the bands we

4225
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Grew up on were influenced by the Beatles

4226
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
A lot of these bands today I hear in

4227
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Interviews I've heard a lot of them say they were influenced by

4228
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
David Bowie this is not a bad thing at all

4229
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
So

4230
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Yeah I'm just you know

4231
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I'm looking forward to

4232
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Rockman the Beatles or whatever it's gonna be

4233
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Except for the fact that

4234
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
They're probably gonna screw us and won't let us

4235
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Import the music into Rockman 2

4236
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
But I mean come on you know you wanna do it

4237
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Like the ACDC that would be the only thing

4238
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
That made it worth buying is the fact that

4239
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I could just dump it all into Rockman you know

4240
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
And add to this stupidly awesome playlist already

4241
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
But I wanna see

4242
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
You know from the standpoint of

4243
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Of someone who works

4244
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
In the absolute bowels of the

4245
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Industry I wanna see

4246
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
How this game's gonna sell when it gets to stores

4247
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Cause there's not really any buzz about it

4248
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I don't have people standing in line to

4249
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Reserve the Beatles I don't have people standing in line to

4250
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Reserve even Guitar Hero Metallica

4251
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I think the Guitar Hero fad is kinda starting to die

4252
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Um and I

4253
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Like I said earlier in the show you know

4254
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
How to run a franchise into the ground I think that

4255
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I think they're barking up the wrong tree

4256
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I think this is gonna be the last

4257
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Ah out there is this Beatles game

4258
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
And then it's gonna be all downhill from there

4259
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I think this is gonna be the last hurrah

4260
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Well I just think it's actually

4261
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Pretty sad that

4262
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
With the current generation

4263
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Is starting to lose relevance

4264
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I mean it's

4265
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Hideous but

4266
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
I mean I understand it but

4267
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
I still think it's horrible

4268
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Who influenced the Beatles?

4269
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
See that's the thing is it's just the passage

4270
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Of time we don't know why they

4271
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Became what they became you know

4272
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Um and

4273
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I influenced the Beatles

4274
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Drugs influenced the Beatles

4275
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
What bands did the Beatles listen to?

4276
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I mean I know we could go on the internet and look it up

4277
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
And find out but I mean you know it doesn't have

4278
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
The relevance because it's not

4279
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
It's not as important anymore

4280
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
You know we know that all the great bands

4281
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
That we listen to listen to the Beatles when they were growing

4282
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Up and so we're like man the Beatles must kick ass

4283
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
What did the Beatles listen to?

4284
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
The answer is who cares?

4285
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
It's too far back for a story about your average

4286
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
15 year old player ain't worried about

4287
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
The Beatles hell Guitar Hero Metallica

4288
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Like I said is not really making as big

4289
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
A deal as I think they need to come up with

4290
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Something newer and popular

4291
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
And topical that's

4292
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Gonna get you know the dollars

4293
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Out of the pockets and

4294
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
So far it's like really I think

4295
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
All of the track packs the

4296
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Band editions whatever

4297
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Have been sort of

4298
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Sort of fail

4299
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Couple comments from chatroom I gotta read

4300
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Chat.orangelandrater.com Black Wolf says

4301
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I don't want it to be something that I can say hey

4302
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I wish I could just import these into rock band

4303
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I hope it's different enough to see it on its own

4304
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Merits rather than just another track pack

4305
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Sure and that's cool

4306
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
But once you're in a party setting

4307
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
And you wanna play

4308
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
Some Beatles and then you wanna play

4309
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
You know some Casey and the fucking

4310
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Sunshine band and you wanna play

4311
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Some Metallica and you wanna play some

4312
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Who and you wanna play some this and you wanna play

4313
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Some that you're not gonna bust out the rock

4314
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Band 2 disc that has 500

4315
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Songs on it and put in the Beatles

4316
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Disc that has 40 songs on it

4317
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
To play a couple songs that's gonna sit on the shelf

4318
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
If you're hardcore enough to own it

4319
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Unless they do a disc swap thing like

4320
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Singstar does that could happen

4321
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Still you don't jump up and just go I'm gonna switch

4322
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Discs yes you're gonna be like

4323
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Man I'm gonna play some other song

4324
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
We do that with Singstar

4325
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Singstar's awesome

4326
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Bullymania in chat says Singstar Abba

4327
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Went back in time and influenced the Beatles

4328
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Yes

4329
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Remember though when we used to play

4330
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
We used to play

4331
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
What the hell game was it

4332
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
No

4333
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Beatmania when we used to

4334
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Switch out our Append discs

4335
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Oh yes the Appends

4336
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
It was kind of a pain in the ass though

4337
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
That was a good point

4338
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
But it was all we had and now there's a better way

4339
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
I will own

4340
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
The Beatles

4341
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Whether it's the rock band Beatles whether it's what

4342
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Because I'm of not that generation

4343
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
But the generation after and you know

4344
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I have the Beatles on my

4345
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
iPod even though I don't own any

4346
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Vinyl you know

4347
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I like the music

4348
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Especially some of the later stuff

4349
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
You know the earlier stuff just doesn't do it for me

4350
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
But it's just like you know they're important

4351
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
You know you should own it

4352
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
If you're into

4353
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
If you're into the niche

4354
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I mean it's not really even a niche but if you're into the part of the industry

4355
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Which we are which is music

4356
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Games

4357
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
If you own Drummania controllers

4358
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
You should probably own this fucking game

4359
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
And if you don't

4360
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
It's gonna depend on how big of a

4361
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Beatles fan you are

4362
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Unless they completely bastardize it

4363
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Which is a possibility sadly

4364
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Which totally is but I don't

4365
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I don't really believe that

4366
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
With Yoko having control I don't believe it either

4367
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Well it's not just Yoko having control

4368
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Cause take Yoko and John Lennon

4369
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
And the dead Beatles and the living Beatles

4370
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
And all that out of it

4371
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Harmonix

4372
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Is gonna have such reverence

4373
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
For the source material

4374
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
That there is no possible way

4375
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
That's true if they fuck it up

4376
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
There will be no forgiveness

4377
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Yeah exactly if they mess it up

4378
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
There will be pitches

4379
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
There will be torches and pitchforks

4380
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
And people will be dying

4381
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
And I mean well you laugh

4382
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
But that's all there is

4383
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
It's gonna be brutal the fallout

4384
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Plus you know

4385
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
If you thought the ET game fallout was bad

4386
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
There's money

4387
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Being thrown at this

4388
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
This is an expensive project

4389
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
This is a

4390
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
This is a deal breaker for harmonix

4391
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
If they mingle this

4392
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
You know it's

4393
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
It's over

4394
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
But act deft has a point harmonix never ever fails to deliver

4395
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Harmonix has very rarely

4396
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Failed in any way shape or form

4397
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Amplitude was a little

4398
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Disappointing after frequency

4399
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And I know I'm gonna get some people being like

4400
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
F you pal for that

4401
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
But frequency was just better

4402
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Alright F you pal

4403
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
We're gonna open it

4404
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Hey if you wanna tell Dan F you pal to his face

4405
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
F me

4406
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
You can call in right now

4407
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Flip me off

4408
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
I'm flipping myself off

4409
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Amplitude was a great game

4410
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Our username on skype

4411
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Is orange lounge radio

4412
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
And you can tell Dan F off right now

4413
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Let's open up the phones

4414
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
We have a caller on the line

4415
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Hi who's this?

4416
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Hi this is Spazinator

4417
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Just

4418
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Two or three really

4419
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Quick things

4420
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Regarding tonight's show

4421
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Yes

4422
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Regarding the whole using

4423
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Of trained cats for

4424
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
advertising

4425
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
What if something goes

4426
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Wrong with the cats

4427
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
What if there is like a catastrophe

4428
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Using I'm sorry using the what?

4429
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Using the trained cats

4430
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
For the advertisement

4431
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
You mentioned in part A

4432
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I believe of the show

4433
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Oh the cats what if something goes wrong

4434
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
What if something goes wrong with the

4435
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
The trained cats

4436
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
That are doing the

4437
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
PETA's gonna write a nasty letter

4438
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I'm sorry

4439
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
What was that?

4440
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I said PETA's gonna write a nasty letter

4441
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
For one I don't know I guess I'm assuming

4442
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
These things are under watch I don't think they

4443
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Just have these kitties all roaming the streets

4444
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Aimlessly I mean there's gotta be

4445
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Something where

4446
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
They've got the cats tracked

4447
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Somehow or the cats are

4448
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
They're being watched

4449
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Which seems like a lot of fucking

4450
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Work for a stinking ad campaign

4451
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
But there's gotta be something they're doing

4452
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
No doubt that's easy

4453
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I don't know if I was like

4454
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
I don't know if I had a mic when you guys were talking

4455
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Yeah I was playing Street Fighter

4456
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Yeah that's the worst thing I've ever heard

4457
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I don't understand what the point is

4458
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Most people see a cat

4459
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Running around and they're just like hey it's a cat

4460
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
I suppose if I saw a cat wearing a fear t-shirt

4461
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I'd be like hey it's a cat wearing a t-shirt

4462
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
But I wouldn't go man

4463
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Fear I gotta buy that fucking game

4464
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
That gets me in the mode to play some MF in 360

4465
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
BlackWolf in chat wants to point out

4466
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
You can see the leashes in the pictures

4467
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
They're on leashes that's how they got it

4468
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Cats hate leashes by the way

4469
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
You know those cats are pissed

4470
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
That's a water spitting leash

4471
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
That is right there

4472
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
So what else did you want to call in about Spaznator?

4473
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Secondly

4474
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
I know that

4475
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
You guys have been complaining about

4476
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
The wind out there in California

4477
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
It could be a whole lot worse

4478
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I didn't know

4479
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
If you guys have been paying attention

4480
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
To the news

4481
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Within basketball days

4482
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
But just in my

4483
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Neck of the woods

4484
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
We just had kind of a semi

4485
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Major plane crash

4486
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
In Buffalo don't you

4487
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I just remembered

4488
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
You got this all wrong by the way

4489
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
We probably actually kind of like the wind

4490
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Because wind is cool

4491
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
We hate the fact that at the sign of a stiff breeze

4492
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Our internet goes down

4493
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
People forget how to drive

4494
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
And shit starts falling over

4495
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
The storms here are nothing compared to the east coast

4496
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I'll tell you nothing compared to the east coast

4497
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
We don't have hurricanes here

4498
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
If we had a hurricane here we'd all die

4499
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
We would be dead

4500
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
If we can't deal with the hurricane winds

4501
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
It's because our buildings can't

4502
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
They're built for earthquakes not winds

4503
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Seriously

4504
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I swear

4505
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
I really

4506
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Don't have a problem

4507
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
With driving in wind

4508
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Because I have driven

4509
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
In heavy wind

4510
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
It's just seeing

4511
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
How many people can

4512
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
People running around with chickens with their heads cut off

4513
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
It's nuts

4514
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
I definitely have seen the news

4515
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I heard about that plane crash in Buffalo

4516
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
What a tragedy

4517
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
There's really no other word to describe it

4518
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Nobody was drunk

4519
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
It wasn't carelessness

4520
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Everything I've heard says it was an ice thing

4521
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Causing a malfunction

4522
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
It was just a tragedy

4523
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Very very sad

4524
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I can just imagine there's just reporters

4525
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
And the media and things swarming

4526
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
All over that town right now

4527
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Plus everybody having to deal with that

4528
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
It was a flight

4529
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
A lot of people were from Buffalo

4530
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
So it's just very very sad

4531
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
They need one of those pilots

4532
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Who managed to land a plane in the river

4533
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
And not have anyone get killed on every flight

4534
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Just some sort of goddamn miracle worker

4535
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
That guy is from California

4536
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
He's from the wonderfully named

4537
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Town of Danville

4538
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I remember that

4539
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
I'm really sorry to hear about that

4540
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
You're calling us

4541
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
You must be okay

4542
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Not at least

4543
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Before I let you guys go

4544
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Would you be able to give

4545
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
A really really quick shout out

4546
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
To my link show in Final Fantasy 11

4547
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Sure why not

4548
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000

02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000

Who is online right now

4559
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Just want to say hi to everyone

4560
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Alright shout out you guys

02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Now go play a real MMO

4562
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Dude you so stole the words out of my mouth

4563
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
I'm going to be like now please

4564
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Sell your copies

4565
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
You know I'm just bitter because I spent so many years on Final Fantasy 11

4566
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
But you know what

4567
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I've heard they made a lot of good changes for the better

4568
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I need to not give a shit

4569
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I would like to see them

4570
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
You know because Final Fantasy 11 is over

4571
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Like what it's almost 6 years old now

4572
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
I would like to see them do it

4573
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
I would like to see them do a new one

4574
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Mine and Jamie's new computers absolutely

4575
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Destroy the benchmark

4576
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
The benchmark program

4577
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
The benchmark program is awesome it's just loaded with Taro Taro's

4578
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I know they're just like

4579
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
I will say Final Fantasy 11 did bring us Taro Taro's

4580
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Alright Spazinator we're going to let you go buddy

4581
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Sure sounds good

4582
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Have a good one later

4583
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
And yes I'm reminded by the chat room

4584
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
That the Hello Kitty Online beta opened yesterday

4585
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
So that's something I might need to check out

4586
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Hello Kitty Bob

4587
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
There's the MMO you ought to be playing

4588
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Oh man we got to be all over

4589
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
We need an Orange Lounge clan on the Hello Kitty Online

4590
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
We need to like

4591
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
But we need to be like bad people

4592
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I don't know how that works

4593
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
All these great companies are going to have a business

4594
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
And Sanrio just keeps plugging along

4595
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Oh got to love them

4596
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Hey you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

4597
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:21,000
It's Hello Kitty Jason clan member 3000

4598
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Awesome what's up

4599
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Do you remember the clan

4600
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
What's up Hello Kitty

4601
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Kitty klutz clan

4602
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Are you responsible for what's happening with the black DS

4603
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Cause I don't think that's right

4604
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
I'm going to back away slowly from these comments

4605
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Jason please put our show back on track

4606
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
What did you want to talk about tonight

4607
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
That confused me a whole lot but that's okay

4608
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
It's interesting that Dan talks about that pilot

4609
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
That did the water landing being brought up in California

4610
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Because our news was all over the place

4611
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Cause he went to school in Colorado

4612
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
There you go see

4613
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
That's why he's good

4614
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Cause he moved somewhere else and learned something

4615
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
What did you call in to talk about tonight Jason

4616
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Did people really believe

4617
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
That Nintendo on

4618
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
You mentioned in part A

4619
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
That the whole

4620
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
3D room environment

4621
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Of the Wii

4622
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Was still code name the revolution

4623
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Did people seriously believe

4624
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
You know there was people that believed it

4625
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
And I will even admit

4626
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
There was a period of 5 minutes

4627
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Where I kind of wished it was true

4628
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
It wasn't true believe

4629
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Actually there's something really funny

4630
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
You can say about that because the first 5 minutes

4631
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Of the trailer you can completely believe

4632
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
The first half of that trailer

4633
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Was beautiful

4634
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
It was amazing

4635
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
But when he

4636
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
We just believed that Nintendo

4637
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Was going to fuck us up for life

4638
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
That they were going to come up with something that was so

4639
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Bad ass

4640
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Like a video game system that you play

4641
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
And it sucks your dick while you're doing it

4642
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Yes you just couldn't resist

4643
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
It's awesomeness

4644
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
And then they gave us the Wii

4645
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Because it was supposed to be totally revolutionary

4646
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
That it's like

4647
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
You know you have a system called the revolution

4648
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
It's going to be

4649
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
You know something very awesome

4650
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
But a game system that fucks me while I play it

4651
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
That's revolutionary

4652
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
It was going to be something completely different

4653
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
And instead

4654
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
We got the last generation of console again

4655
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
With

4656
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
A controller that gets

4657
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Grandmas don't want to play

4658
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
And that's I guess good

4659
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
For everybody

4660
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Grandma would play a fuck me revolution

4661
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Who would Konami sue then?

4662
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Seriously though

4663
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
It's just

4664
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
It's a great console

4665
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
For everybody but gamers

4666
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Or

4667
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
It's a great console for gamers

4668
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
With really low standards

4669
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
And low self esteem

4670
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Okay

4671
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Well yeah

4672
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Because of course it's low self esteem

4673
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Because your Nintendo keeps telling you you're fat

4674
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Nintendo goes you're fat

4675
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
You're ugly

4676
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Have you ever set that up? Do you half Wii Fit?

4677
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Yes I do

4678
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
And you make your Mii stand there and he's looking all nice

4679
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
And confident and then you jump on that board

4680
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
And it detects what you weigh

4681
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
And then the guy just sort of slouches

4682
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
And then gets fat

4683
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
And then yeah it starts harassing you

4684
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
I'm sorry this is more accurate for

4685
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
What you are

4686
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Exactly I played brain age

4687
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
And my DS told me I was stupid

4688
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
You have the brain of an 85 year old Alzheimer's patient

4689
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Your brain is 65 years old

4690
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
It's tired now

4691
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
You can't understand the word blue

4692
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Stupid

4693
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
The next time I see Reggie I'm going to punch him in the face

4694
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Which gets hundreds of thousands

4695
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Of hits on the entire web

4696
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
So I mean I don't know

4697
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
It's not that what Nintendo's done isn't

4698
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Quote unquote revolutionary

4699
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
To you know

4700
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
The mass market video game

4701
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
Public who hasn't played a game system

4702
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Since they played the 2600 from Atari

4703
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
But it's not

4704
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
You know the next generation for gamers

4705
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
And when Nintendo was telling us

4706
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
The Wii is going to mess you up

4707
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
The Wii is going to be something that you will never

4708
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Expect

4709
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
We're going to redefine video games

4710
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
The Wii is going to take your mother out to date

4711
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
And then sex her

4712
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
The Wii is going to get your mom out the house

4713
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
So that you can have orgasmic video game experiences

4714
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
We were ready for that

4715
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
And what we got was the Wii

4716
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
And so I mean did we believe it?

4717
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
No

4718
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Did we speculate about it? Sure

4719
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Instead we've got my mom

4720
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Who won't get off the fucking TV because she's playing

4721
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Elibits

4722
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
We didn't know it was going to be

4723
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
The GameCube 2

4724
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
You guys talking about it

4725
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Just made me think about that trailer

4726
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
The first half of it was great

4727
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
But as soon as it said Nintendo on

4728
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
The music changed and he actually tried to

4729
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Make up what the system

4730
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Was going to be

4731
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
If

4732
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
I don't know

4733
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
What to do

4734
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
I don't know how to describe the people that believe

4735
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
The second half of that trailer

4736
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Mario looked like Luigi for crying out loud

4737
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Nintendo has never

4738
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Done that

4739
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Has never made concept art that looks that bad

4740
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
Mushroom Kingdom was in a forest

4741
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
The video just cut out abruptly

4742
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
And

4743
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Virtual environments don't exist

4744
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
You don't make games

4745
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
I guess there's RPG Maker but

4746
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Yeah that made good games

4747
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Anyways

4748
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
It was Nintendo trying to convince you that the world

4749
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Was going to change

4750
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
If the fanboys believe it's strong enough it will come

4751
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Exactly

4752
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
They were going to say look the 360 you think that's great

4753
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Maybe you see what we got for you

4754
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
That's something that Sony was the master of

4755
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
In the last generation

4756
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
And they used that to bury the Dreamcast

4757
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Sony was the master

4758
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
In the last generation just like rumble was

4759
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
That's what PlayStation 2 does

4760
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Because the PlayStation 2 is going to mess you up for life

4761
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
And they were sort of right

4762
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
But they used it to bury the system

4763
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Nintendo just did the same thing

4764
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
And it worked

4765
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
It fucking worked again

4766
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
From Nintendo, Nintendo watched Sony and just learned

4767
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
They were like look

4768
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
We're going to sit out this generation with this little GameCube

4769
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
And we're going to put out some good games for the hardcore

4770
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
But the next generation, we're going to dominate again

4771
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
And you know what, they did

4772
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Because that's what Nintendo does

4773
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
They make mistakes

4774
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
And they conquer the god damn world

4775
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
And you know the DS has done it

4776
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
And I remember when the DS came out

4777
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Everybody was like wow

4778
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
They replaced the GBA with this

4779
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
This thing sucks

4780
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
And look at the DS now

4781
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
It's standard gamer equipment

4782
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
If you don't have one

4783
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
There's something wrong with you

4784
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
And the Wii is kind of the same way

4785
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Except for the fact that gamers own it

4786
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Then they look at me and they go

4787
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
What am I going to have to buy for it?

4788
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
And I'm like Mario Kart and Smash Brothers are both worth owning

4789
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
And Zelda's always fun

4790
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
And if you don't own Mario Galaxy

4791
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
You may as well sell your Wii

4792
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
And that's it

4793
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Oh, Metroid Prime 2

4794
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
That's still at least five games I guess

4795
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Those are all the Nintendo franchises

4796
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Well Jason, thank you for the lively discussion

4797
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
And also thank you

4798
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
While I have you on for all the hard work you and Digman did on the new website

4799
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
It looks great

4800
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
And I know the chatters are loving it

4801
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
They're filling it up with articles

4802
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
We're very excited

4803
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I know what you have to thank me for

4804
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Dan was the one that carried that whole segment

4805
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
And Digman was the one doing the whole website

4806
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Practically doing all the website work

4807
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
You were the one calling

4808
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
I know you helped him

4809
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
So thank you for the help

4810
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
I know Digman probably did the biggest chunk of that

4811
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
But he used to get some props

4812
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Alright well Jason we're going to let you go

4813
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Because we're going to wrap up the show

4814
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
We've got to get out of here

4815
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
We've got to get out of here

4816
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Especially if we're going to try and do some stuff with Street Fighter 4

4817
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I don't know if Justin TV is up again

4818
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
But we'll at least try to get YouTube or something

4819
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
I restart my computer because

4820
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
I figure maybe restarting the computer

4821
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Will make it work

4822
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Now my desktop likes to refresh itself

4823
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Over and over and over

4824
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
And over and over and over

4825
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
My Mac

4826
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Stopped working after I did an update

4827
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
My laptop is sitting in there

4828
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
I can't do a damn thing with it

4829
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
I restart it and I just get the logo with the little spinning thing

4830
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
And my friends online told me to use the shift

4831
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Use the S key, it still won't work

4832
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
I'm not worried about that because

4833
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
I haven't really done any actual updates

4834
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
With this in a while so I need to do

4835
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Service Pack 3 and that kind of stuff

4836
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
But it's just

4837
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
It's still kind of funny

4838
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Because it's annoying

4839
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Because all my icons disappear and then they come back

4840
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
And then they disappear and come back

4841
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
And disappear and come back

4842
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
But I'm trying it one last time here

4843
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
And restarting it didn't anything

4844
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
I did search on the problem too

4845
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
And there was some guy that had the problem back in 2007

4846
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
And no one seemed to have an answer

4847
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Except shut down

4848
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Flash Media Encoder and restart it

4849
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
I'm like okay I've done that eight times now

4850
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
It doesn't do anything, stupid

4851
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Alright we'll try to figure out

4852
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
What's going on there but

4853
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
For the meanwhile we are going to get the hell

4854
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Out of here, we're going to pack it up

4855
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
And get on out because we still have the after birth

4856
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
We got to do too so we got to fly through that

4857
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
And get out of here so

4858
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Let's go around and first we'll get some last minute stories

4859
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Before we close up shop

4860
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Do we have last minute stories tonight?

4861
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Yes

4862
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Nice, anything else?

4863
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Loki do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?

4864
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
No I don't have anything ready because I've been trying to get

4865
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Flash Media Encoder to work

4866
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Alright wow a night with no last minute stories

4867
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Then we'll go around and hear everybody's final thoughts

4868
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Dan thank you so much for being here once again

4869
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
And contributing

4870
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
We always love your

4871
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Opinions and such

4872
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Especially being a long time gaming fan

4873
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Come back again sometime

4874
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Yeah four or five years maybe

4875
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
Alright

4876
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Any final thoughts for listeners?

4877
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Yeah Street Fighter 4

4878
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Is absolutely legit

4879
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
Although

4880
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
The Xbox controller

4881
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Is a way of making fighting games

4882
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
It's like

4883
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Slamming your dick in a door

4884
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
It's just not any fun

4885
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
If you buy Street Fighter 4 for your 360

4886
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
And you're not going to invest in an arcade stick

4887
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
You're high

4888
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
I'm thinking about getting it for PS3

4889
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Just on the controller alone even though I know more people on 360

4890
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
I don't know

4891
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Dark Sakura since you're right over there

4892
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Enjoy the tea and the parting

4893
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Gifts from me

4894
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
I so will enjoy the tea

4895
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
I might make you save me a bag

4896
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Which I know is a dumpy thing to do for a gift

4897
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
But I really want to try it

4898
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Shut up Dan

4899
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners?

4900
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
I'm glad I have tomorrow off

4901
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Because my voice hurts

4902
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Rub it in why don't you?

4903
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Loki do you have any final thoughts?

4904
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
No I'm just

4905
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Pissed off now because explore keeps

4906
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Crashing and reinstalling

4907
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
I just have to actually go do real

4908
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
Updates because I've been

4909
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Just letting it do its crappy automatic updates

4910
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
Stuff and you know

4911
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Whatever

4912
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
And my final thought is I would like to be

4913
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Over having clogged up sinuses

4914
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Now

4915
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Alright there you go just approve it

4916
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Alright

4917
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000

02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000

It really is a labor of love like look at the new website

4924
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
That was done for nothing

4925
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000

4926
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
