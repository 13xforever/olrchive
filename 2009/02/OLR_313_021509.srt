1
00:00:16,153 --> 00:00:24,292
[SPEAKER_05]: A landmark Sony store says goodbye, Mario and Sonic get ported to the Winter Olympics, and is Namco Bandai about to acquire DJ Ranma?

2
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:35,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:40,397
[SPEAKER_07]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:48,006
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week here in the OLR studios in Sacramento, California is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:52,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's feeling a little bit under the weather apparently.

6
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:53,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

7
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, we're all under the weather.

8
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,684
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing, one kind of common theme.

9
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:57,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm above the weather.

10
00:00:58,246 --> 00:01:00,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm over it all.

11
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:01,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm above the weather.

12
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:02,490
[SPEAKER_07]: No one is above the law.

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,152
[SPEAKER_02]: The weather is not the law.

14
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,193
[SPEAKER_02]: The weather is chaos.

15
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:08,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been kind of sick the past few days.

16
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a horrible Valentine's Day because of it.

17
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki's a little bit sick as well.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello, Techmaster Loki.

19
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little sick and a little eating sandwich.

20
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:19,102
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

21
00:01:20,143 --> 00:01:24,985
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some of the folks on Justin.TV are already commenting how messy the studio looks tonight.

22
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, that's what happens when you're sick.

23
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:27,206
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't really feel like cleaning.

24
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:33,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, we're presented in widescreen tonight, so you can see even more of the mess that is usually offscreen.

25
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:35,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering why there's lightbox in there.

26
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,130
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I really didn't notice.

28
00:01:37,315 --> 00:01:38,496
[SPEAKER_07]: DanTheMan Hello Back for more

29
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:06,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have no place else I'd rather be You're lying, your internet's out at home, isn't it?

30
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,281
[SPEAKER_07]: True that

31
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:11,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's internet's out at home, so, you know, he's here.

32
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:12,918
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably back on by now.

33
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:13,958
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, but you're here.

34
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:14,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been nice talking to you.

35
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,159
[SPEAKER_07]: With us.

36
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:22,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's storms going on out in California right now, which is, you know, for most of the rest of the world, the storms here are actually pretty pitiful.

37
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:29,983
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, compared to the rain they get, like, back east and stuff, but it's just not built out here to withstand some of the wind things we get.

38
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:33,184
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we get a little windy, internet goes down left and right.

39
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:33,844
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty sad.

40
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:34,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

41
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:55,350
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

42
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:18,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a relatively busy gaming week despite school stuff.

43
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:24,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I started playing City of Heroes this morning just on the trial.

44
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I started playing with Sauce.

45
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty fun.

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked an electric power user who was a pretty cool character.

47
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:39,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the most fun part is actually designing your character and making costumes and stuff, so that was pretty cool.

48
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:51,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I also finished, well, I'm trying to think, what all did we play last night on the Genesis Collection?

49
00:03:52,372 --> 00:04:06,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night being Valentine's Day evening, my husband and I decided to do something super romantic and we played Xbox all night after I got us a lovely dinner prepared at Whole Foods.

50
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:23,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we played a lot of Genesis Collection and some R-Type Dimensions, and I played some Symphony of the Night, and played a little, a couple of DS games, but I don't remember what.

51
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:28,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I downloaded and installed Perfect World, but I haven't started that yet.

52
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm thinking City of Heroes is going to be the game of choice.

53
00:04:32,952 --> 00:04:34,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard some interesting things about City of Heroes.

54
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:37,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of us OLR peeps needs to get on that and check it out.

55
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:38,634
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be me.

56
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:39,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it.

57
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:43,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Tiara on City of Heroes, or was that a while ago?

58
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:44,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, cool.

59
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:45,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we played together today.

60
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:52,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know the new website's launching very, very soon, and we're going to have Tiara hopefully doing some articles for us there, so it'll be good.

61
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:53,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else for your gaming week?

62
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I can think of.

63
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Then how about presents?

64
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:57,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I like presents.

65
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:58,511
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, some presents.

66
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to show this to Justin TV before I give it to Jamie here.

67
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:06,953
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got Jamie an authentic hula girl for her dashboard to match the one that Loki had.

68
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:08,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's from Hawaii.

69
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:11,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though these presents are like a month old, I'm just now remembering to give them to her.

70
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:16,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I know Jamie's a tea drinker, I got her different types of tea that are very Hawaii.

71
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:19,777
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is a coconut macadamia herbal.

72
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:20,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

73
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,831
[SPEAKER_07]: and the other one is Pineapple Waikiki.

74
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:23,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's great.

75
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:24,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I love pineapple.

76
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:25,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

77
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:28,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Some tropical teas there for DarkSakura.

78
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:31,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I could totally use it because my voice is dying.

79
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:31,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

80
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:34,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm almost kind of wishing I brought some more home for me but that's okay.

81
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I have other stuff.

82
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:42,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you already got your presents a few weeks ago so he doesn't feel left out but he got a matching hula girl.

83
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:43,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, tell us about your gaming week, Loki.

84
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,831
[SPEAKER_08]: You picked the perfect time when I have my mouth full of food.

85
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:50,722
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing around with modding the different files and seeing what that does.

87
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:17,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I've been playing with making different weapons and I have, you know, the typical stuff, a weapon that has, like, way too much physical power.

88
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:21,897
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, you shoot it into somebody and they bounce around like a ping pong ball.

89
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:23,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

90
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:24,456
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

91
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:57,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm on a couple of them, so I can try the multiplayer in that.

92
00:06:57,235 --> 00:07:06,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that's really good, then I may pick it up on all five consoles, and then that way we can play multiplayer in Lost and Damned.

93
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Then other stuff I've been playing, I played the Killzone 2 demo, which is actually pretty good.

94
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:15,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Very similar to Resistance, you know, as far as I'm concerned.

95
00:07:16,865 --> 00:07:19,327
[SPEAKER_08]: The game itself, not so much...

96
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:34,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Not as hard as Gears of War, of course, although the game itself, the AI is very intelligent, it seems, so I can't just easily kill them or just run up on them and stuff like that.

97
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:37,426
[SPEAKER_08]: But it looks cool, and I think it'll be very entertaining.

98
00:07:37,586 --> 00:07:45,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if I'm actually going to pick it up right away because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2, but maybe soon after.

99
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

100
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:02,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm no good at the game at all, so it was easy enough to beat on it.

101
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:05,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Not as easy as some videos would make it seem.

102
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:14,612
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't just go high-kicking everything around because the AI is smart enough to know, hey, I'm going to kick your ass now because you're just doing the same move over and over and over again.

103
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:18,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people it works like the women with the long legs, of course.

104
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:24,597
[SPEAKER_08]: It works pretty well, but it's not just like you put on auto-fire and leave the room.

105
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:25,937
[SPEAKER_08]: They will kick your ass.

106
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:28,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Helluja!

107
00:08:56,002 --> 00:09:03,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you like some of the English dubbing, then you can go ahead and leave it English, or you can just switch it to Japanese per character.

108
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,531
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty awesome.

109
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,554
[SPEAKER_08]: That also has cutscenes and all the other stuff too.

110
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:10,197
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought that was really cool.

111
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And then other than that, I mean, it's just kind of fun.

112
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing with some of the new characters.

113
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Rufus is kind of funny.

114
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

115
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:19,588
[SPEAKER_08]: El Fuerto is pretty cool.

116
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:22,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Repeat what your wife said about Rufus because that made me laugh.

117
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was playing as Rufus and then Nelly's like, that looks like me but with blonde hair.

118
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, come on.

119
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:30,856
[SPEAKER_08]: That is ridiculous.

120
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:32,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rufus is the big guy, right?

121
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:34,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's the one that has his belly flab.

122
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:37,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Nelly is one of the tiniest people I've ever met.

123
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:40,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Her beard also totally isn't that impressive.

124
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:44,805
[SPEAKER_07]: She was talking about herself.

125
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,661
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Rufus is like me if I were to be in a fighting game, pretty much.

126
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:57,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what I want to see now, I want to see Rufus versus... Okay, I'm going to go way back here, everybody.

127
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:57,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready?

128
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Raiden from Fatal Fury.

129
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:00,405
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to see.

130
00:10:01,465 --> 00:10:02,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see that fight.

131
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:03,946
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to wait for the next round of crossover.

132
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Chang from...

133
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:08,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, from Fatal Fury 2.

134
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:09,554
[SPEAKER_02]: From Art of Fighting.

135
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:11,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and Seth is a bitch.

136
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:17,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Seth, the final boss, you know, who has, like, moves from all the other, you know, Street Fighter characters.

137
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:18,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he sucks.

138
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Even on easiest, he's fucking cheap.

139
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:23,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get some comments from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

140
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat is pointing out, you sound different tonight.

141
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,841
[SPEAKER_07]: VSJSV says, Loki sounds weird.

142
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,121
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw says, you sound slightly deeper.

143
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:30,221
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because I'm congested.

144
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:31,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's been sick too, like all of us.

145
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally every host in the LLR is sick tonight.

146
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:34,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

147
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,104
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my sexy voice.

148
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:36,944
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

149
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:37,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel okay.

150
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in time for Valentine's Day.

151
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:46,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki wants you to get down this week with Street Fighter 4.

152
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:51,851
[SPEAKER_08]: We have live women on the... waiting by their phones for your call.

153
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:57,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Some comments are chat.

154
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Leo Shen wants to know, how's Crimson Viper?

155
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Death or Alive, Soul Calibur,

156
00:11:25,658 --> 00:11:27,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Death or Alive, Soul Calibur, Street Fighter

157
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:45,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Rufus has booby physics Rufus has mooby physics

158
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:15,006
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's like gut physics.

159
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:15,968
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

160
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:18,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's okay.

161
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:21,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like I said, I'm no good at Street Fighter, and I don't

162
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:25,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretend to be, you know, winning any arcade game.

163
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:30,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hell, I lose to the computer on easiest sometimes, so that's pretty bad.

164
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:34,139
[SPEAKER_07]: You just need to do what I do with Chun-Li and just hit the kick button repeatedly.

165
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,679
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't work.

166
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:41,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Even on easiest, the computer would be just like, okay, you stop doing stuff, I'm going to walk over and punch you now.

167
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:43,885
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're actually, it's pretty hard.

168
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:48,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it ramps up based on how well you're doing, but, you know, easiest isn't

169
00:12:50,172 --> 00:13:03,141
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw in chat says every time I hear the word Rufus the first thing on my mind is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures I was thinking Rufus Shinra but I watched that pretty recently alright

170
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:07,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I'll talk about mine.

171
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:09,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine was pretty much the same as Jamie's.

172
00:13:09,065 --> 00:13:13,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a lot of the new Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection, except I played it for the PlayStation 3.

173
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,752
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't have it on 360 when I went, and I actually was thinking, you know what?

174
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:22,476
[SPEAKER_07]: For the classic games, I think I'll want the D-pad on the PlayStation 3 controller, and why not?

175
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:27,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a lot of games that offer trophies, so if I feel like being an achievement whore on the PS3, why not?

176
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes sense.

177
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:29,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So I picked it up.

178
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pretty sure I'm getting the exact same freaking...

179
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:33,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

180
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, the game collection is pretty awesome.

181
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you cannot beat the value.

182
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:49,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $40 for, what, no, sorry, 40 games for $30, and then like 9 unlockables in there.

183
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:51,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the unlockables are pretty awesome.

184
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:57,290
[SPEAKER_07]: You get some arcade games like Altered Beast, Fantasy Zone, Shinobi, which was awesome.

185
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:04,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dan had pointed out a fact I didn't think of before the show, but they have never released an official port of Shinobi Arcade for the home systems.

186
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:05,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you had the dub down.

187
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,456
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been lots of Shinobi ports.

188
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:10,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, but not the authentic arcade version.

189
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, a lot of them were dumbed down for the 8-bit systems.

190
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they had Shinobi on the NES from Tengen, if I remember right, but it was pretty dumbed down, you know?

191
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:20,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It was different.

192
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:23,987
[SPEAKER_07]: At least they tried to at least emulate the actual arcade version.

193
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:29,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember Ninja Gaiden on the NES was completely different from Ninja Gaiden Arcade, but for the better in that case.

194
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:30,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Way better.

195
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:30,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Way better.

196
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:31,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow.

197
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:37,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Random tangent, but I just remember being a kid, like it was Shinobi over here, and Ninja Gaiden over here, or like the two big ninja games he had.

198
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:38,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyhow.

199
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:41,039
[SPEAKER_07]: The collection is great.

200
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely worth the money.

201
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,205
[SPEAKER_07]: A slight disappointment that they didn't do more with the online functionality, especially when they've had us buy this collection before on the GameCube.

202
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:55,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And these, you know, or I shouldn't say the same collection, but you know, Sonic games at least, all bundled together and so on.

203
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Little disappointed that they didn't do at least leaderboards.

204
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:03,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Online multiplayer, something that brought in the extra functionality.

205
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:03,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

206
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Downloadable games.

207
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:05,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

208
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:12,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we all noticed Revenge of Shinobi was missing from the collection and some other big Genesis titles from back in the day are missing completely.

209
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not have these as like download content?

210
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:16,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be actually kind of rad.

211
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,885
[SPEAKER_07]: But I somehow doubt that's how they're going to do it.

212
00:15:19,945 --> 00:15:20,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Why should they?

213
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:28,771
[SPEAKER_07]: They released Sonic 1 and they released... Didn't the original Streets of Rage come out for download 360 and one of the Sonic 2 was download content for Xbox Live Arcade?

214
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Streets of Rage 2 Dead

215
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:31,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Trades 2, not 1

216
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,751
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the reason to have a CDX though.

217
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:26,664
[SPEAKER_07]: for more games.

218
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's no CD games in this.

219
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:29,348
[SPEAKER_07]: No Sewer Shark.

220
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:31,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just small and easy.

221
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:32,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Nomad, you know.

222
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:37,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's the next Sonic's Ultimate CDX Collection.

223
00:16:37,721 --> 00:16:39,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll have freaking Night Trap.

224
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:44,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want to play the Dana Plato game?

225
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why I want to play the Dana Plato game, but I do.

226
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:47,582
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what games though?

227
00:16:47,622 --> 00:16:49,524
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Microcosm and Sewer Shark.

228
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:50,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Microcosm I actually liked.

229
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,408
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Dragon's Lair.

230
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:56,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my Jaguar collection?

231
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:00,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it should be, non-existent.

232
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It would just be Tempest 2000.

233
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be Tempest 2000, that's all.

234
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,061
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

235
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:06,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was one other good Jaguar game I can't think of right now.

236
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:07,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Defender?

237
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:12,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to comments from chat, Acidic Vampire says they need some tougher achievements in that collection.

238
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:19,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the achievements are a little easy, but again, that's why online leaderboard at least would have been cooler so you have something else to obtain.

239
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the achievements are a little easy.

240
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:23,691
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a little on the easy side.

241
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:25,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them will take you a little bit of determination to get...

242
00:17:27,974 --> 00:17:28,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was on the easiest.

243
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with the trophies.

244
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:31,178
[SPEAKER_07]: The trophies and achievements are the same thing.

245
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:36,483
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that on the PlayStation, instead of worth points, they're worth either bronze, silver, or gold, depending on what it is.

246
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:38,866
[SPEAKER_07]: But I unlocked a gold trophy easy.

247
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:41,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the Sonic Spinball.

248
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, maybe it's just because I love Sonic Spinball.

249
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:46,374
[SPEAKER_07]: For whatever reason, don't laugh, but I got 10 million points on Stage 1.

250
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:47,095
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all you have to do.

251
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's like beating Stage 1, pretty much.

252
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:50,198
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get you that.

253
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:53,260
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably unlikely, but can you combine games together?

254
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, with Sonic Spinball and all the Sonic games, you can do the Sonic and Knuckles stuff.

255
00:17:57,923 --> 00:17:58,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, no.

256
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:01,245
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, you couldn't do that with Sonic Spinball, I don't believe.

257
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:01,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can.

258
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:02,626
[SPEAKER_04]: You can play as Knuckles, yeah.

259
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:03,927
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do Blue... No, you couldn't.

260
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:05,648
[SPEAKER_04]: You could do Blue Sphere.

261
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:08,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there was something, I think, like one little extra thing it gave you.

262
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:09,710
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can play as Knuckles in Spinball.

263
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,191
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't.

264
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:12,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can.

265
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you could.

266
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you thought wrong.

267
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:21,891
[SPEAKER_04]: My Genesis collection, which I mean is not a CD for my Xbox, but is a box full of Genesis crap, is sitting by my TV.

268
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:25,433
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to come on by, we'll walk on.

269
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: But you get something with it.

270
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:27,394
[SPEAKER_07]: You get something.

271
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:27,954
[SPEAKER_07]: You get the blue.

272
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:30,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like all the other games, it does the blue sphere game.

273
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:31,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even the complete one.

274
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's only with Sonic the Hedgehog.

275
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:34,978
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of dumb.

276
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:37,305
[SPEAKER_07]: But interesting.

277
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:39,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

278
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still looking at comments in the chat room.

279
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,853
[SPEAKER_07]: GameGuru says it was Sonic 2 that gave you Knuckles.

280
00:18:44,614 --> 00:18:47,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, some of them gave you the extra character.

281
00:18:47,938 --> 00:18:48,199
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

282
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's it for Gaming Week.

283
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:54,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless, Dan, you want to... I don't know if you played some stuff that Jamie didn't that you want to share with us.

284
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:55,508
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Dan, do you have anything?

285
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:57,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played nothing new this week.

286
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still playing HD Remix.

287
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:01,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I played R-Type Dimensions.

288
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:05,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.

289
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,258
[SPEAKER_04]: For Shinobi, mostly.

290
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:09,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's what I have to say.

291
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Online leaderboards suck.

292
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why you like them.

293
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:19,124
[SPEAKER_04]: All they do is serve to remind me that the games that I think that I'm good at, I really, really suck at.

294
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:20,766
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gives you something to work towards.

295
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:27,493
[SPEAKER_04]: All I know is go to the online leaderboards for R-Type Dimensions and see the people who have beaten that game without dying.

296
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:30,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Every one of those people I want to kick in the balls.

297
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I was good at R-Type.

298
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:34,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I am no good at R-Type.

299
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:35,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate you all.

300
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:37,197
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some game.

301
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:41,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the Midway Collection, I think, one of the first that came out, and it had online leaderboards.

302
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:51,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, for a while, I was in the top ten for Wizard of War, that old-ass 80s game, and that made me feel pretty cool, even though, like, nobody probably fucking played Wizard of War.

303
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:54,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I dominated Road Blasters on that and the Xbox for months.

304
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:55,762
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

305
00:19:56,122 --> 00:19:56,342
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

306
00:19:56,382 --> 00:19:56,862
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be fun.

307
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:57,362
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

308
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:58,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, somebody owned me.

309
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:01,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And that person, when I find you...

310
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:02,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

311
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:02,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

312
00:20:28,647 --> 00:20:31,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

313
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:33,490
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple things on the table right now tonight.

314
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,232
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are listening to us live on allgames.com or on JustinTV, hello.

315
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:39,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, by the way, again, to the JustinTV listeners.

316
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,014
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look at us on camera at JustinTV.

317
00:20:41,134 --> 00:20:47,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why you'll want to watch a radio show, but that's what the listeners asked for, so we gave it to them.

318
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep in mind, we still don't have our issue fixed where...

319
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,682
[SPEAKER_07]: You can hear all the sound that goes out over air, so you only hear what goes through the microphones.

320
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:55,723
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't hear any of the music.

321
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to bring the adapter for that.

322
00:20:58,265 --> 00:20:59,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a huge deal.

323
00:20:59,286 --> 00:20:59,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a huge deal.

324
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:02,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope that everybody's still at allgames.com to get the full experience.

325
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,790
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know there's some people that because of firewalls and stuff, they can't.

326
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,955
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have Justin.TV, which seems very odd to me that you would be able to watch Justin.TV, but whatever.

327
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:14,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people have claimed that happens, so it's interesting.

328
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:16,318
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's interesting.

329
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,226
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

330
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,925
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to happen live tonight during the show a little later on.

331
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:45,889
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's right now while we're taping.

332
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:48,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the meantime, you can still join us at chat.

333
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:51,793
[SPEAKER_07]: There is still a link on OrangeLawnTrader.com to go to our chat room.

334
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not being affected by the site outage.

335
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Just check out OrangeLawnTrader.com, okay?

336
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:00,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Some folks in chat sharing their online leaderboard experiences.

337
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:05,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, I was at one point in the top 20 users in championship mode of Pac-Man CE.

338
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:07,059
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a tough one.

339
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:08,659
[SPEAKER_07]: That is an achievement.

340
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:09,639
[SPEAKER_07]: That is an achievement.

341
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:10,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Achievement unlocked.

342
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,040
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a big EP for that one because that is not an easy game to be doing that with.

343
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:24,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news and all that and talk about what's new in the gaming world this week.

344
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you done with your sandwich, Loki?

345
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,602
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not done with my sandwich, but that's okay.

346
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll make it work anyway.

347
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:30,503
[SPEAKER_07]: The show must go on.

348
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:32,484
[SPEAKER_08]: With or without sandwich.

349
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:34,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, let me say this real quick.

350
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:38,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give a quick shout out to our buddy Brad from PodCulture.

351
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,628
[SPEAKER_07]: He started a new podcast for that show Dollhouse.

352
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant to watch that.

353
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:44,050
[SPEAKER_02]: I did watch it.

354
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Joss is the man.

355
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:49,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully he has more listeners than there were viewers for The Dollhouse.

356
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, did it not do well on the ratings?

357
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:56,577
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it lost to Super Nanny, and I will have to say, I was part of the Super Nanny crowd, unfortunately.

358
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:59,039
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though, hopefully... Rude.

359
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,780
[SPEAKER_02]: They just can't screw this up the way they did Firefly.

360
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:11,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it'll make up some viewers from TiVo and iTunes and all that stuff right now.

361
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:12,487
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's on a bad night.

362
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:15,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, most people don't stay home and watch TV on Fridays.

363
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:15,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Well,

364
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:24,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole problem is that they screwed up Firefly so bad that people are going to have a bad impression of those who never went back to watch the DVDs.

365
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Joss is the man.

366
00:23:26,353 --> 00:23:27,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm serious.

367
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:30,475
[SPEAKER_08]: If you put this show on any other day in the week, I think you'd be fine.

368
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:31,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

369
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:37,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Fox does have this tendency to give Josh Whedon the death spot on Friday nights.

370
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:47,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to knock Fringe, because I love Fringe, but if you want this show, if it's kind of tanking for you guys, why don't you just throw Dollhouse right after American Idol?

371
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:50,173
[SPEAKER_08]: That way you get a really big lead-in.

372
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:51,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they will one night.

373
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:53,014
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll give it a shot after American Idol.

374
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, because the show was pretty decent.

375
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:55,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, let me put it this way.

376
00:23:55,895 --> 00:24:03,277
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm like the gay guy you hear on the podcast or whatever, but seriously, if I was straight, Elijah Dushku, you betcha.

377
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:04,237
[SPEAKER_07]: You betcha.

378
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:05,878
[SPEAKER_07]: She is pretty hot.

379
00:24:06,098 --> 00:24:07,158
[SPEAKER_07]: She's very hot.

380
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's happening for real.

381
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:12,080
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I didn't give the website.

382
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Support our buddy Brad's podcast.

383
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's thedollhousepodcast.com if you're a Whedon fan.

384
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:19,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You should check that out and support that show.

385
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:20,465
[SPEAKER_04]: But Joss is owned.

386
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Buffy just doesn't strike twice.

387
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:25,339
[SPEAKER_04]: He hit too big too soon.

388
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:26,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all downhill from there.

389
00:24:29,508 --> 00:24:30,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Firefly was awesome.

390
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten times better than Buffy.

391
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:33,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got screwed off of TV.

392
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:37,133
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't see what the fans are hoping for.

393
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:42,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad's actually saying in chat, we started a Deadpool on PodCulture about how long it'll take Fox to axe it.

394
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:45,239
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty morbid, but sad, but true.

395
00:24:45,459 --> 00:24:57,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there had been talk about them actually doing a Faith spinoff, but this was a different idea, and I think that it was that he and Eliza Dushku came up with the idea together, so...

396
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, the show's not bad.

397
00:24:58,928 --> 00:25:04,310
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little hard to get into because I think the first episode kind of hits the ground running, but it's not bad by any means.

398
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it on SyFy.

399
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, shit.

400
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:11,033
[SPEAKER_08]: They just got, you know what, reruns of, you know, some Stargate spinoff.

401
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, just put it on there.

402
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:14,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but Stargate Atlantis was crap.

403
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:16,975
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, look, we got to get into gaming news.

404
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:18,875
[SPEAKER_07]: We suddenly have turned into the nerdy podcast.

405
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:19,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

406
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:21,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to infringe on pod culture's territory.

407
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, what?

408
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:25,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Turned into?

409
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:27,289
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

410
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:27,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

411
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I watch a lot of TV during the week, okay?

412
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,850
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

413
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,250
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

414
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever since I stopped playing WoW, I have watched a shitload more TV than I used to.

415
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:36,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never have watched Dollhouse.

416
00:25:37,112 --> 00:25:40,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Before it used to be, okay, House and Nip Tuck or whatever.

417
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's like eight shows I'm watching.

418
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:44,815
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like too much.

419
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,775
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, Amazing Race starts tonight.

420
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:47,495
[SPEAKER_02]: One show.

421
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:48,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Tivo it.

422
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:49,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Supernatural.

423
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched Wife Swap last week.

424
00:25:52,256 --> 00:25:53,296
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how pathetic I was.

425
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:56,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Super Nanny, but Wife... I actually watched Wife Swap, then Dollhouse.

426
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:58,538
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't, like, watch Super Nanny religiously.

427
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:01,820
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, if it's on, it's like... Sorry.

428
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hey.

429
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, got more news for us.

430
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:05,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki wants to start us off with a story tonight.

431
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:06,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

432
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:07,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

433
00:26:08,082 --> 00:26:28,301
[SPEAKER_08]: After all the assumptions that the viral video wasn't necessarily a viral video, or was a viral video but just not leaked out, apparently that video that was out last week showing zombies in a Las Vegas type of setting with a giant atmosphere and stuff like that,

434
00:26:29,142 --> 00:26:30,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that was actually Dead Rising 2.

435
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:37,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And Capcom did announce Dead Rising 2, which will be coming out on PC, 360, and PS3.

436
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:40,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It will take place in a brand new city.

437
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Fortune City.

438
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:45,529
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like Las Vegas.

439
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:47,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will be a gambling paradise.

440
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,792
[SPEAKER_08]: No longer will you be playing Frank West, but some guy in a jacket.

441
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:53,793
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's... Boo!

442
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:54,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo to that.

443
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:55,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

444
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:56,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Frank West is awesome.

445
00:26:57,955 --> 00:26:59,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But has he covered wars?

446
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:11,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

447
00:27:11,787 --> 00:27:12,727
[SPEAKER_08]: But see, here's the thing.

448
00:27:12,847 --> 00:27:13,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And will it blend?

449
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:18,149
[SPEAKER_08]: We're only talking like four screenshots and everyone's assuming that Frank West is not there.

450
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:21,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Frank West is there, but maybe there's two-player co-op.

451
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's multiple characters.

452
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's multiple characters.

453
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:24,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he's a zombie.

454
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:25,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I know.

455
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not giving up hope yet.

456
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:29,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like the super zombie and you have to run over him with a riding lawnmower.

457
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising Chop Till You Dry

458
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,237
[SPEAKER_07]: After playing the 360 version.

459
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:53,739
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have new costumes in there.

460
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,905
[SPEAKER_07]: The entire fun of the 360 version is taking pictures while you're doing these horrible things to the zombies.

461
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but they took that out of the Wii version.

462
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:01,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

463
00:28:01,468 --> 00:28:05,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they had patched that for two-player co-op, same screen or something.

464
00:28:05,253 --> 00:28:05,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

465
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:13,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about TV shows in the chat room and video game potential, Acidic Vampire suggests Super Nanny the game.

466
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:14,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

467
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:17,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the sense that would just be Imagine Babies or something like that.

468
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:19,778
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is Super Nanny?

469
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:26,801
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this show where they call the 800 number, the producers of the show, if their kids are just out of control.

470
00:28:27,801 --> 00:28:29,382
[SPEAKER_07]: You should watch this show because it would piss you off.

471
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:31,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is Mary Poppins modern day?

472
00:28:31,023 --> 00:28:31,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

473
00:28:31,363 --> 00:28:34,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, actually, the lady's name is Joanne or something.

474
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:37,445
[SPEAKER_07]: She's from Britain, so she has the accent and everything.

475
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:42,827
[SPEAKER_07]: She even carries a little umbrella, and she comes and she restores harmony to the household.

476
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:45,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to restore harmony to a household with unruly children?

477
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:46,108
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

478
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:46,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Duct tape.

479
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:48,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Ceiling.

480
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:57,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, this last episode that I missed Dollhouse for, it had this guy, this abusive dad, who's slapping his kids and stuff.

481
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:57,591
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, what?

482
00:28:57,671 --> 00:28:59,512
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't slap the baby.

483
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:02,174
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the way to raise your baby.

484
00:29:02,614 --> 00:29:03,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like an hour of that.

485
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:06,176
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot slap your baby.

486
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:10,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad I don't watch that show because it sounds retarded.

487
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:11,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just frustrating.

488
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:15,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know the thing that pisses me off the most, Rob, is watching people be stupid.

489
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:27,533
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why, like, I think your own personal hell would be shows like... Like, you'd be strapped to a chair, forced to watch this, and Wife Swap, and... I don't know, some of these feel-good reality shows.

490
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:29,254
[SPEAKER_02]: That would feel good my ass.

491
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:32,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching people be stupid is the worst form of torture ever.

492
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:33,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what I like to do?

493
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to watch The Biggest Loser while eating.

494
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, now that would be great.

495
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:01,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

496
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:03,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Sugary goodness.

497
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:04,584
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

498
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:06,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

499
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:07,606
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get back to gaming news.

500
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:08,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we please?

501
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:12,751
[SPEAKER_07]: One place I will not be eating ice cream ever again at is the Metreon.

502
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:15,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know the Metreon here at Orange Lawns Radio.

503
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:17,735
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have a lot of very fond memories of the Metreon.

504
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:22,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no memories of the Metreon other than it used to exist because I've never been to the Metreon.

505
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, let me say it.

506
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:27,143
[SPEAKER_07]: The Metreon is not closing, but the Metreon has gone through a lot of changes in the past few years.

507
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:28,805
[SPEAKER_07]: For one, it's not owned by Sony anymore.

508
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:40,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why I say the Metreon holds a special place in our hearts, the very first Dance Dance Revolution tournament, if you've been listening to this show for any length of time, you know DarkSakura, Loki, and myself, we all met playing DDR at the arcade.

509
00:30:40,695 --> 00:30:44,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The first Dance Dance Revolution tournament I ever went to was at the Metreon.

510
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:49,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you remember that we went to the Metreon the day we decided to do the radio show?

511
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:51,509
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

512
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:53,470
[SPEAKER_07]: OLR was born on a trip to the Metreon.

513
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

514
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,191
[SPEAKER_02]: The third mix that was half-faded.

515
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,091
[SPEAKER_02]: No, fifth mix that was half-faded.

516
00:30:58,212 --> 00:30:58,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, I remember that.

517
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it had been halfway in direct sunlight.

518
00:31:00,312 --> 00:31:04,954
[SPEAKER_07]: At that cool little arcade, and that was when they had the little Oops, I Went to Hell store or whatever that chick was.

519
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:08,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I can't remember the name of the... Oops, I Went to Hell store?

520
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:14,241
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the chick was on all these shirts that say, Oops, I just ran over something.

521
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, Oops, I had sex with your boyfriend.

522
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:17,965
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like the little niche on all these shirts.

523
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:20,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just remember getting one that said, Oops, I went to hell.

524
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:20,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

525
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the name of the character.

526
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,831
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't an Emily character.

527
00:31:23,812 --> 00:31:24,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

528
00:31:24,693 --> 00:31:24,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

529
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:25,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, forget it.

530
00:31:25,954 --> 00:31:28,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen Nightmare Before Christmas there twice.

531
00:31:29,036 --> 00:31:30,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they have the IMAX theater and everything.

532
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:31,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now it's owned by Westfield.

533
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,179
[SPEAKER_07]: That happened a couple years ago.

534
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,500
[SPEAKER_07]: It got changed over.

535
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,841
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing is that they still have the Sony store.

536
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess what?

537
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:46,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, in an interview with GameSpot, Sony has said the lease for the Metreon for the PlayStation store will expire this summer.

538
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:48,810
[SPEAKER_07]: We have chosen not to renew it.

539
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,452
[SPEAKER_07]: They are saying the lease expires on March 31st.

540
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:52,833
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Sony store is going...

541
00:31:53,393 --> 00:31:54,233
[SPEAKER_07]: to be closing.

542
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:55,854
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of sad in a way.

543
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it is and it isn't.

544
00:31:57,575 --> 00:32:02,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the Sony store was a little overpriced and glamorous and everything.

545
00:32:02,536 --> 00:32:09,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, well, they charge the same price you'd pay in any store, but they didn't really have sales or anything like that going on there.

546
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything was very high-end or whatever.

547
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,462
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very nice, but it was still kind of nice that Sony had an official place.

548
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

549
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:22,565
[SPEAKER_07]: And they did all their launch parties there, and there were some Final Fantasy things that went on there.

550
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:23,405
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of sad.

551
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:25,566
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the end of an era, in a way.

552
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:40,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, by the way, speaking of the launch parties, Sony has apparently said they are still always looking at new avenues for additional retail exposure in space, but they felt it best not to continue with a dedicated PlayStation store at the Metreon at this time.

553
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:45,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, if you haven't caught on yet, the Metreon, right off of 4th Street in San Francisco.

554
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:48,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be closing.

555
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,449
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sony store is closing, not the whole thing.

556
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:56,214
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a couple of other notable things about the Metreon apart from having a pretty decent arcade there.

557
00:32:56,914 --> 00:33:02,119
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the video game Walk of Fame.

558
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they still have that.

559
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:05,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was still there.

560
00:33:05,322 --> 00:33:05,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It was their...

561
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:08,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

562
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it might have changed hands when it went to Westfield.

563
00:33:10,706 --> 00:33:11,266
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not sure.

564
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:13,547
[SPEAKER_02]: This was there since it changed hands.

565
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:13,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it?

566
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:14,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

567
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:16,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been since it was Sony.

568
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:17,988
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a couple years since I've been.

569
00:33:18,008 --> 00:33:19,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was still Sony last time I went.

570
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:21,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I went not too long ago.

571
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:22,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You could tell the place was hurting.

572
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this was right when the first arcade they had closed.

573
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It was empty.

574
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,510
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.

575
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,350
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hurting.

576
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this was a couple years ago before everybody said the economy was going to crap.

577
00:33:32,171 --> 00:33:34,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, you know, just double that with...

578
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:39,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Quest X would cause problems for the release of Final Fantasy XIII.

579
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:05,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, they really, it's just that they can't, um, really be sure if it's going to affect it or not.

580
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:11,612
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dragon Quest IX is going to be, um, delayed from March to July.

581
00:34:12,532 --> 00:34:15,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't know if that's going to cause Final Fantasy XIII to get pushed back.

582
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's actually supposed to be out, um, in Japan this year.

583
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:26,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, over here and in Europe next year, um, sometime around April 2010.

584
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:26,699
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

585
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:37,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It was also reported that 3D Realms mentioned that the delay on Dragon Quest X also is going to be delaying Duke Nukem forever.

586
00:34:38,863 --> 00:34:39,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, gee!

587
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:42,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though the games have nothing in common.

588
00:34:43,185 --> 00:34:45,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's very much in common.

589
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:46,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Both are going through delays.

590
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:52,348
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is, though, a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy XIII out, so look for it and see.

591
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:53,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Another new one?

592
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:54,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is this the same one that was out a couple weeks ago?

593
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the one that's been out for a couple weeks.

594
00:34:56,968 --> 00:35:00,050
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that shows some of the battle and CGI.

595
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

596
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:01,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

597
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:03,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Boy, oh boy.

598
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:05,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Just when Final Fantasy XIII needed another delay.

599
00:35:06,014 --> 00:35:06,835
[SPEAKER_02]: The slimes, Rob.

600
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:07,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Slimes.

601
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:11,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at this point, though, I'm just kind of used to it.

602
00:35:11,198 --> 00:35:13,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like Final Fantasy XIII, it'll be out when it's out.

603
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I take that back.

604
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's Dragon Quest IX or Dragon Quest X. It's IX.

605
00:35:18,343 --> 00:35:18,683
[SPEAKER_07]: It's IX.

606
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:20,064
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I said Dragon Quest IX.

607
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:22,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I said X. Never mind.

608
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:25,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest X will be delayed until 2012.

609
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:27,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, X is also delayed.

610
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure X will be out eventually.

611
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:32,526
[SPEAKER_08]: So therefore they can't start working on X. Makes perfect sense to me.

612
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:34,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you anything X is on the Wii.

613
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:37,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Or whatever, maybe Nintendo's next system.

614
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:40,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the last Dragon Quest game that they had on the Wii was so awesome.

615
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:41,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying.

616
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:44,638
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll go for wherever the big market is.

617
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:45,659
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

618
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:50,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then the next Dragon Quest game would be in my pants.

619
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:53,127
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the biggest market out there.

620
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:54,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shush.

621
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:56,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to know about that because of slimes.

622
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:57,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

623
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:03,572
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, Activision has talked about their 2009 lineup.

624
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:06,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

625
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:36,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Prototype sometime this year, probably around June.

626
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:41,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And you better believe that there's probably going to be tons of freaking Guitar Hero games.

627
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they already said there's going to be a ton.

628
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:45,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there probably will be a ton.

629
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:47,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they're going to renege on that.

630
00:36:51,744 --> 00:36:54,085
[SPEAKER_07]: But only half the company is going to E3, right?

631
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:54,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

632
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,604
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no Blizzard in this Activision Blizzard.

633
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:03,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Which doesn't make any sense to me because you're one company, you can't have half your company not go.

634
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,963
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they can get away with it because everybody knows about Diablo 3 and StarCraft 2, which is we all know what Blizzard will be showing, so what the hell.

635
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:12,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody wants to see those.

636
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:14,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they know.

637
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:15,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody already knows about them.

638
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:16,565
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't need to know.

639
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:22,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero Greatest Hits or How to Run a Franchise into the Ground Without Ever Even Really Trying.

640
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:30,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think the reason why they're probably not going to be obviously going to E3 is because then if they show all this stuff off, all their big announcements for BlizzCon will be ruined.

641
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're going to PAX.

642
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:33,372
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're going to BlizzCon.

643
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And seriously, if they shorted E3, it has to come out.

644
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:38,246
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like StarCraft Ghost.

645
00:37:42,132 --> 00:37:43,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at some comments from chatroom.

646
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:46,374
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw is talking about the whole Dragon Quest thing.

647
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:49,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because Dragon Quest made you jizzed in my pants.

648
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:51,856
[SPEAKER_07]: A little reference to the Saturday Night Live sketch.

649
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:52,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

650
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Their album just came out.

651
00:37:54,717 --> 00:37:55,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on a boat.

652
00:37:56,237 --> 00:37:59,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine though if Dragon Quest X really was in Loki's pants?

653
00:37:59,798 --> 00:38:01,179
[SPEAKER_07]: A wild schlong approaches.

654
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:07,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, jizzed in my pants.

655
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:11,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm selecting run.

656
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:20,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, something that has run away, far, far away, is the release date for Guild Wars 2.

657
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:21,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad.

658
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:26,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, Guild Wars 2 originally was supposed to be out in 2008.

659
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:27,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember that?

660
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,330
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to be out in 2008.

661
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember 2008 like it was last year.

662
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:32,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was.

663
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:36,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it got pushed back, and now it's been pushed back 2010 to 2011.

664
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:42,379
[SPEAKER_07]: is the new time frame for when Guild Wars 2 is supposed to be out, if you can believe it.

665
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:43,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a huge release window.

666
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:45,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that's sometime in the fiscal year.

667
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,764
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying probably April 2010 to 2011.

668
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wait until people have jobs.

669
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:52,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Or forgot what Guild Wars 2 is about.

670
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:52,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

671
00:38:53,691 --> 00:38:56,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I got devastated on Kotaku for saying it doesn't matter.

672
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody buys Guild Wars.

673
00:38:59,491 --> 00:39:01,172
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who play Guild Wars care.

674
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:03,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody new is playing it.

675
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not WoW, so nobody cares.

676
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:12,641
[SPEAKER_07]: The people playing Guild Wars are the people that bought it way back when it came out so they didn't have to pay the monthly fee and they're still playing it after all this time.

677
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:22,889
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think their new subtitle to Guild Wars 2 will actually improve their client base.

678
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:26,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Guild Wars 2 now with Rampant Nudity.

679
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:28,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, naked.

680
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Big booby adventure.

681
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: How about something a little bit different?

682
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:40,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say real quick, though, the delay possibly because of the layoffs that NCSoft has just had.

683
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And to note, they're also skipping E3 this year.

684
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:46,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, NCSoft kind of has some issues going on anyway.

685
00:39:46,715 --> 00:39:48,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Going out of business.

686
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:51,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope not, because there's a lot of Guild Wars fans that will be very upset.

687
00:39:51,880 --> 00:40:02,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as long as, if they go out of business, they better release the standalone City of Heroes player creator for all the updated outfits and stuff.

688
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:06,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I just want to say though, like at PAX, I remember we were live one night.

689
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:09,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember how we did the whole all games thing live at PAX and we were all at the table?

690
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:10,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Rob, I don't remember that.

691
00:40:11,406 --> 00:40:20,890
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to dig through the memory banks and find it because I remember one night we were sitting at the table and there was a line coming out the door for the panel and one of them had to do with Guild Wars.

692
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:26,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I distinctly remember it was a Guild Wars panel because I think we were making fun of Guild Wars a little bit while all the people were in line and getting scowled at.

693
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:33,015
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course every panel at PAX had a line going out the door and around and down the stairs so we had captive audiences.

694
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:35,536
[SPEAKER_02]: The piracy one was hilarious.

695
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:36,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, anyhow, sorry.

696
00:40:37,788 --> 00:40:45,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost pirated the game during the piracy panel I remember Loki trying to do that he was trying to pirate a game during the piracy panel just to be ironic

697
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:49,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You're such an ass, Loki.

698
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:50,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

699
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:51,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Jackassery.

700
00:40:51,805 --> 00:40:52,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

701
00:40:53,106 --> 00:40:57,069
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how about people who are Warhammer 40k fans?

702
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:01,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is not me, because I get tired of the stupid little figures.

703
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:13,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, for our listeners who don't know, I had a bad experience with an ex who was addicted to Warhammer 40k and his stupid, retarded little lead figures and having to paint them, but I'm not bitter.

704
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:24,388
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister's ex actually is really into Warhammer 40k and he does paint the figures and he also LARPs and also plays Vampire the Masquerade.

705
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I LARPed but then I grew up in Berkeley.

706
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to point out, our wife swapped this week.

707
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:29,712
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a LARPer.

708
00:41:30,993 --> 00:41:31,173
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

709
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:34,375
[SPEAKER_02]: They swapped with... What, what?

710
00:41:35,316 --> 00:41:36,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Blood figures are tasty.

711
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,501
[SPEAKER_07]: This explains a lot, actually.

712
00:41:44,175 --> 00:41:48,398
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why Dan's not allowed to eat anything that I don't approve of first.

713
00:41:49,739 --> 00:42:06,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so they're working on a beta now for, well actually they had the beta out for Dawn of War 2 and that it has already prompted a big massive patch of

714
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of changes to go into the game, so it is supposed to be going through, so if any of the beta players can actually say anything about it, and I'm sure there's NDAs and whatnot about that.

715
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:23,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, they need the patch, since it comes out, what, like...

716
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week?

717
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously.

718
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:27,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

719
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:29,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We might be seeing a delay if it's big enough.

720
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:39,399
[SPEAKER_02]: But it had to be enough that if they're going to... In fact, actually, I think this is kind of a fun quote put out by Relic.

721
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we just make mistakes.

722
00:42:41,921 --> 00:42:43,422
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only human after all.

723
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:47,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But other times there are very good and well thought out reasons behind the changes.

724
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we forgot to put legs on the goblins.

725
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:50,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they can't move.

726
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:51,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot!

727
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:51,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Naked!

728
00:42:51,908 --> 00:42:52,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Naked!

729
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:54,555
[SPEAKER_07]: How about a hug?

730
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:56,236
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only human after all.

731
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:58,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to leave in naked.

732
00:42:58,457 --> 00:42:59,817
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the world.

733
00:43:01,558 --> 00:43:02,118
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

734
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:02,858
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

735
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:05,579
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Warhammer.

736
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:08,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go play with the lead figures instead and make real friends.

737
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat the lead figures.

738
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:13,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

739
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:17,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, get out of your house and go... Eat some lead figures.

740
00:43:17,823 --> 00:43:18,023
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

741
00:43:18,343 --> 00:43:19,303
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not candy.

742
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:21,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

743
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,167
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's what they should do.

744
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Warhammer 40k gummy figures.

745
00:43:25,429 --> 00:43:29,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Then that way when you destroy their army, you can literally bite off their heads.

746
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're just like, oh, battle damage.

747
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:33,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you just use goldfish?

748
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:36,254
[SPEAKER_07]: That would actually be a pretty awesome type of role-playing game.

749
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:40,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I want to come up with a role-playing game that's like Gummy Bear Warfare or something like that.

750
00:43:40,276 --> 00:43:40,476
[SPEAKER_07]: You could!

751
00:43:40,516 --> 00:43:40,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

752
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:41,996
[SPEAKER_07]: They have fuzzy heroes.

753
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,517
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be awesome.

754
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:44,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuzzy heroes.

755
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,058
[SPEAKER_02]: The game you use with stuffed animals.

756
00:43:46,379 --> 00:43:48,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of Jell-O Wigglers.

757
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,220
[SPEAKER_02]: TM.

758
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:54,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I want to create my own role-playing game now that involves me eating.

759
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to play like Advance Wars.

760
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:58,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to figure this out.

761
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,041
[SPEAKER_02]: You can totally make it out of chocolate shell and ice cream.

762
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:05,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Or even better, a role-playing game that's comprised completely with snack food.

763
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:08,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to build units with different snack foods.

764
00:44:08,364 --> 00:44:10,225
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya says, OLRPG.

765
00:44:10,945 --> 00:44:12,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to like this idea.

766
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Add it to our dream games.

767
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:19,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was going to say, maybe our dream game company can not just make console games, but will make tabletop games too.

768
00:44:20,192 --> 00:44:23,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And OLRPG will be all based around food.

769
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:25,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft suggests Fat Princess with RPG elements.

770
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:26,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I like this idea.

771
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Fat Princess for real.

772
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:29,342
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a good idea.

773
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:31,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I approve of this thought.

774
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:40,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently there's a new game coming out that was revealed during Nintendo of Japan's Fall Media Conference.

775
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, it wasn't really a big title.

776
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:46,547
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game called Kensax.

777
00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:53,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And what this is, it's actually a first-party game that is tied with a search engine.

778
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you have different games that are in there.

779
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:01,373
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

780
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:28,108
[SPEAKER_08]: of words with a 3x3 board, and you conduct different search terms, and whoever finds the highest hit count wins.

781
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:32,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they have some that are finding a certain amount.

782
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, you can also update it, I guess.

783
00:45:34,652 --> 00:45:37,833
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a library of 3,000 words, and you can add more to it.

784
00:45:38,293 --> 00:45:44,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, you go online to increase the vocabulary plus...

785
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Update search results.

786
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think if anything had sex or porn in it, you're going to win.

787
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,003
[SPEAKER_08]: This game sounds stupid and boring.

788
00:45:52,203 --> 00:46:02,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like something that you do when you're at work and you're on a firewall connection where they've locked out anything good and all you can do is just find something to amuse yourself.

789
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what this sounds like.

790
00:46:06,334 --> 00:46:06,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan's got it.

791
00:46:07,254 --> 00:46:09,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know all about that.

792
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:13,039
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so bad, it makes me want to punch myself right in the face.

793
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:15,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

794
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:17,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Punch yourself in the face.

795
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:19,343
[SPEAKER_07]: How many search results do we get from that?

796
00:46:21,464 --> 00:46:22,485
[SPEAKER_08]: At least six.

797
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:27,247
[SPEAKER_08]: The question is how many results down do you have to go before you actually hit porn?

798
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:28,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Punch yourself in the face.

799
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:30,269
[SPEAKER_07]: 265,000 results.

800
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:32,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Porn?

801
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,290
[SPEAKER_07]: How many results for porn?

802
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,051
[SPEAKER_07]: 245 million for porn.

803
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:36,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn wins.

804
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:38,633
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet is for porn.

805
00:46:39,298 --> 00:46:40,819
[SPEAKER_07]: How about boobs?

806
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:43,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Only $60 million for boobs?

807
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:43,721
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up with that?

808
00:46:46,063 --> 00:46:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one thinks if you've got porn, boobs come with it.

809
00:46:49,346 --> 00:46:50,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

810
00:46:50,747 --> 00:46:52,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Where there's porn, there's boobs.

811
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:57,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, where there's Mario and Sonic, there's bound to be the Olympics!

812
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:03,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Mario and Sonic at the Summer Games ended up being pretty much a sleeper hit for Sega's

813
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:08,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's probably no surprise that Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games is official.

814
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:18,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And Sega did announce it earlier this week that Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic will once again compete on the Wii S and the DS in Vancouver.

815
00:47:18,642 --> 00:47:19,242
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii S?

816
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:21,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I said the Wii and the DS, right?

817
00:47:21,643 --> 00:47:23,384
[SPEAKER_02]: You said the Wii S and the DS.

818
00:47:23,804 --> 00:47:24,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, works fine.

819
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:25,125
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii...

820
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:33,092
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii S in Vancouver is where, of course, the 2010 Olympic Games are being held.

821
00:47:33,552 --> 00:47:39,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And just in case you want to know how big that first Mario game was, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, the first one, 10 million units globally.

822
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:45,797
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, the new one, the Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games, it's going to support the Wii Balance Board.

823
00:47:46,758 --> 00:47:50,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the events that will be in it, speed skating, alpine skiing, so on and so on.

824
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:54,061
[SPEAKER_07]: No news about curling, but I hope to hell they do not forget curling.

825
00:47:56,843 --> 00:47:57,404
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

826
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:59,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics.

827
00:47:59,065 --> 00:48:00,747
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they are making a deck of Sporta 2.

828
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:02,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they really?

829
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:02,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

830
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:03,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

831
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:08,213
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to branch the whole and Sonic out to the Olympic Games to other mascots.

832
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:11,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Master Chief and Sonic at the Olympic Games.

833
00:48:13,418 --> 00:48:17,662
[SPEAKER_07]: A game guru suggests the next game should be Mario and Sonic at the Special Olympics.

834
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:20,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about that.

835
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:23,187
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be it.

836
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:24,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that got picked up.

837
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:25,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan was off mic.

838
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:28,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Dan said it had to be Tails and Toad.

839
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:31,510
[SPEAKER_07]: At the Special Olympics.

840
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,251
[SPEAKER_07]: All the characters there, everybody doesn't care about anymore.

841
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:37,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Toadette.

842
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:38,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't stand Toadette.

843
00:48:38,472 --> 00:48:40,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Toadette definitely is in the Special Olympics game.

844
00:48:41,392 --> 00:48:46,114
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to do an evil one with Waluigi and Shadow.

845
00:48:48,574 --> 00:48:48,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

846
00:48:48,894 --> 00:48:50,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to destroy the Olympics.

847
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:54,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sad trombone.

848
00:48:56,452 --> 00:48:57,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad trombone.

849
00:48:57,453 --> 00:48:58,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, release dates.

850
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy trombone.

851
00:48:59,374 --> 00:49:00,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, can I do a plug?

852
00:49:00,534 --> 00:49:00,694
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

853
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:03,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course you can do a plug.

854
00:49:05,396 --> 00:49:13,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I am true to my word, I would actually like to plug a website that...

855
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:28,284
[SPEAKER_02]: My only teacher this semester happens to have, because I know that we've got other designers and people listening to this show, so I did want to go ahead and give his website a little plug.

856
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:34,671
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to mehallo.com, it's M-E-H-A-L-L-O dot com, go look at his fonts.

857
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:35,111
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great.

858
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:40,773
[SPEAKER_02]: See, was that painless?

859
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:41,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, spell that again?

860
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:44,794
[SPEAKER_02]: M-E-H-A-L-L-O dot com.

861
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:45,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I put me hello.

862
00:49:47,174 --> 00:49:47,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

863
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,855
[SPEAKER_02]: He has some very excellent fonts.

864
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:50,755
[SPEAKER_02]: He designs fonts.

865
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:52,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very cool.

866
00:49:52,476 --> 00:49:56,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we have a new webpage on the way.

867
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

868
00:49:57,797 --> 00:49:58,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

869
00:49:58,817 --> 00:50:02,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So, how about release dates, Rob?

870
00:50:02,657 --> 00:50:03,597
[SPEAKER_07]: How about release dates?

871
00:50:03,977 --> 00:50:08,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those are the games that stuff is released on, huh?

872
00:50:09,038 --> 00:50:10,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, how about the 20th?

873
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:15,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's really the only date this week that we've got stuff coming out in the UK.

874
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,320
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 50!

875
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,601
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 Cent Blood in the Sand on Xbox 360.

876
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:24,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the hell with Street Fighter 4 then if this game's coming out.

877
00:50:24,182 --> 00:50:24,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, this is Europe.

878
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:29,079
[SPEAKER_02]: On 20th, Cryostasis on PC.

879
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:37,065
[SPEAKER_02]: More, we have Elodies, The Adventures of Kai and Zero on DS.

880
00:50:38,026 --> 00:50:39,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Men of War on PC.

881
00:50:40,368 --> 00:50:44,031
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it's, you know, Sexy Man Calendar and Camo Speedos.

882
00:50:45,812 --> 00:50:46,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Necrovision.

883
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:47,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that just sounds kind of gross.

884
00:50:47,974 --> 00:50:49,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Necrovision on PC.

885
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Race Pro on Xbox 360.

886
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:54,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Mega Drive Collection 2.

887
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:56,447
[SPEAKER_02]: on PlayStation 3.

888
00:50:57,968 --> 00:51:02,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 4 on PS3 and Xbox 360.

889
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:07,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, in the PlayStation 3 version, you get Ken.

890
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:10,871
[SPEAKER_02]: A figure of Ken in the U.S.

891
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:12,612
[SPEAKER_02]: A Ryu.

892
00:51:13,012 --> 00:51:14,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, which one's the one we got Ken?

893
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:15,113
[SPEAKER_08]: None of them.

894
00:51:16,253 --> 00:51:17,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was Ryu, never mind.

895
00:51:19,214 --> 00:51:20,454
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we had a conversation about that.

896
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:22,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and also that Warhammer piece of shit.

897
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Reviews better anyway.

898
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:25,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

899
00:51:26,023 --> 00:51:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Dan will argue with you until he is red in the face.

900
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken's cooler, just because he wears red.

901
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:37,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why I said red in the face, not blue in the face.

902
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:39,659
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that Warhammer crap comes out too.

903
00:51:41,922 --> 00:51:43,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a big Warhammer fan, are you?

904
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:46,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon

00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:05,084

[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Quest V, The Hand of the Heavenly Bride will be coming out on DS as well.

908
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:17,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Prinny, can I really be the hero on PSP?

909
00:52:17,793 --> 00:52:20,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, this is that game they keep telling me I need to play.

00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:28,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Warhammer 40,000, Dawn of War 2 coming out this week as well on PC.

920
00:54:02,662 --> 00:54:10,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And naturally, they are getting a Street Fighter 4 as well from around the world, although I believe the Japanese release just came out for them actually this past week.

921
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:12,045
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

922

[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of Japanese stores are going to be importing the other country's versions for collectors.

00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, not a lot on the PlayStation 3 this week.

925
00:54:26,412 --> 00:54:31,574

[SPEAKER_07]: on the PlayStation 2, Biohazard Code Veronica Complete.

930
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That would, of course, be Resident Evil.

931
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Sacred Blaze is a big game coming out this week from Flight Plan.

932
00:54:49,881 --> 00:54:53,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's pretty much what you got coming out on the PlayStation 2.

933
00:54:53,642 --> 00:54:55,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking a quick look at the Nintendo DS.

934
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:59,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Locke's Quest this week, Saru Saru DS, Sim Animals as well.

00:55:02,663 --> 00:55:04,704
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hikkyo Takentai...

00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:30,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Shotoko Special and Shining Force Feather is the big release from Sega this week on the DS and lastly on the PSP Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories gets a price reduction Idol Master SP Perfect Sun looks to be the other big release Perfect Sun, Wandering Star and Missing Moon all come out from Namco Bandai on the PSP this week in Japan

938
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:36,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the good old days when the PSP got games and wasn't just used to emulate old consoles?

939
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but Idle Master is a huge thing in Japan.

940
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:42,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it caught on over here, but it's... Really?

941
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:44,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know how you would describe Idle Master.

942
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:45,046
[SPEAKER_04]: It never came out over here.

943
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:47,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I was totally looking forward to that new Idle Master game.

944
00:55:47,949 --> 00:55:53,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't it like a take on American Idol type thing, but it's not actually a singing game?

945
00:55:53,193 --> 00:55:56,495
[SPEAKER_07]: You guide your contestants through these games somehow.

946
00:55:56,556 --> 00:55:56,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

947
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:57,977
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a sim game.

948
00:55:57,997 --> 00:55:59,978
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a game that I used to have on...

949
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:02,702
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

950
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:06,234
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking about something irrelevant.

951
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:12,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I was actually talking about Dreamcast.

952
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a game called Super Producers that I never got very far in.

953
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:22,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way that it was is there were different mini-games in it that you would manage a pop idol's career.

954
00:56:23,096 --> 00:56:27,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it sold very well over there, though, even.

955
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:28,780
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a weird game.

956
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm telling you, you need to bring back, on the PSP, C&C Music Factory make the video thing.

957
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:35,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck yeah!

958
00:56:37,374 --> 00:56:38,015
[SPEAKER_07]: or something.

959
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:41,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other type of make the music video game.

960
00:56:41,257 --> 00:56:45,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan was talking though about a Clicovision game that was here.

961
00:56:47,881 --> 00:56:49,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't recall.

962
00:56:50,423 --> 00:56:51,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Manager game?

963
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:53,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a football manager game.

964
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:55,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember those guys.

965
00:56:55,366 --> 00:56:56,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I had one of those on the Commodore 64.

966
00:56:57,007 --> 00:56:58,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I didn't know what the hell I was doing because I was like 7.

967
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:02,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news.

968
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:04,092
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to do it for release dates.

969
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:06,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Midway.

970
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,965
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, weren't we just, like, singing the joys of Midway last week?

971
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:18,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you'd say the joys, but... Well, we were talking about how, you know, Midway was the, you know, pretty cool.

972
00:57:18,628 --> 00:57:19,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially back in the day.

973
00:57:19,748 --> 00:57:24,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, their arcade collections will really show you, like, how awesome, you know, they are.

974
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:27,731
[SPEAKER_07]: But they haven't had a lot lately going for them, but Mortal Kombat.

975
00:57:27,871 --> 00:57:29,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Even more than that now.

976
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:31,933
[SPEAKER_02]: They have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

977
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:47,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad Trombone But basically the CEO, Matt Booty, I'm trying not to laugh, said that it was a difficult but necessary decision.

978
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:57,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, for those who don't know, Chapter 11 gives you relief from your creditors so that you can regroup and get your financial plan back together.

979
00:57:58,486 --> 00:57:59,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I won't.

980
00:58:00,566 --> 00:58:12,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of those creditors that they owed money to, at the tune of $281 million in liabilities, and of course they only have $167 million in assets.

981
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:16,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Wells Fargo Bank, they owe $150 million to.

982
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:25,333
[SPEAKER_08]: National Amusements, they owe close to $20 million to, and apparently they paid for the manufacturing costs during the

983
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:36,862
[SPEAKER_08]: for Midway's holiday lineup, NBA Properties Inc., almost $17.3 million in licensing and royalty fees, Warner Bros.

984
00:58:36,902 --> 00:58:50,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Interactive, $6.6 million, and Epic Games, $1.975 million for licensing and royalty fees, probably for Unreal Tournament.

985
00:58:52,602 --> 00:58:55,903
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of interesting that they are doing so horribly.

986
00:58:56,043 --> 00:59:02,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I also read another story that apparently somebody had purchased controlling shares of Midway for only $100,000.

987
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:09,268
[SPEAKER_08]: So some dude out there owns like 80% of the company now with $100,000.

988
00:59:09,628 --> 00:59:10,989
[SPEAKER_04]: The mystery investor.

989
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:11,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

990
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:17,331
[SPEAKER_04]: They inherited like millions and millions of dollars in debt.

991
00:59:19,016 --> 00:59:23,258
[SPEAKER_04]: and basically paid virtually nothing for tons of the rights.

992
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:24,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's like the mystery investor.

993
00:59:25,579 --> 00:59:30,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, supposedly he's supposed to be protected from the debts, but he's still going to make more than $100,000 on the deal.

994
00:59:30,762 --> 00:59:34,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, because he's going to get all the rights.

995
00:59:35,524 --> 00:59:37,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Then he's going to make Mortal Kombat out of his basement.

996
00:59:39,526 --> 00:59:42,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Mortal Kombat versus the Care Bears or something.

997
00:59:42,127 --> 00:59:44,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Mortal Kombat versus your mom.

998
00:59:45,069 --> 00:59:45,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

999
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:50,998
[SPEAKER_07]: This doesn't mean, though, that Midway is shutting its doors or anything.

1000
00:59:51,098 --> 00:59:53,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It just means it's not a good sign.

1001
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:53,942
[SPEAKER_08]: They might as well.

1002
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:56,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Just sell Mortal Kombat to somebody else.

1003
00:59:57,387 --> 01:00:03,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, other than Mortal Kombat, there hasn't been a lot that they've put out lately that's been any good.

1004
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:06,653
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the purpose, though, of the Chapter 11.

1005
01:00:06,693 --> 01:00:12,577
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chapter 11 is meant for a company that they see recovery in their future.

1006
01:00:13,157 --> 01:00:15,398
[SPEAKER_02]: This just gives them momentary relief.

1007
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:22,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have to say, though, what I think of when I think of Chapter 11 in this day and age is, like, remember what happened with Mervin's, the big clothing store chain here in California?

1008
01:00:22,603 --> 01:00:25,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Mervin's filed for Chapter 11, and not even a week later, they were gone.

1009
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:28,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the liquidators were coming into town.

1010
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:30,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to worry a little bit.

1011
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:32,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I know it's still a preemptive step, but...

1012
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:42,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Chapter 11 bankruptcy basically gives a company a chance to come to terms with its creditors and arrange alternative financing.

1013
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,013
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the financing's not out there, they're hosed.

1014
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:47,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Circuit City closed down after being in Chapter 11.

1015
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:56,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you go back to like the 80s, I mean, this is 80s style, Worlds of Wonder, who made like Teddy Ruxpin and Laser Tech.

1016
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1017
01:01:12,594 --> 01:01:18,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And if only they had combined Teddy Ruxpin and Lasertag together, they would have been an unstoppable force.

1018
01:01:18,837 --> 01:01:19,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you they did.

1019
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:25,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you that somewhere at Worlds of Wonder there was a Lasertag that you could, like, shoot at Teddy Ruxpin and he'd be like, Stop.

1020
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1021
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't you my friend?

1022
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:29,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Were they the ones that made My Buddy?

1023
01:01:29,582 --> 01:01:30,162
[SPEAKER_07]: My Buddy.

1024
01:01:30,282 --> 01:01:31,282
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was Galoob.

1025
01:01:31,302 --> 01:01:32,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1026
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:34,304
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to Galoob?

1027
01:01:34,344 --> 01:01:34,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they...

1028
01:01:35,546 --> 01:01:37,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Micromachines, they made Micromachines too.

1029
01:01:37,968 --> 01:01:42,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Galoob I think got bought up by Hasbro or Mattel or somebody significant.

1030
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:46,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think they're still making Micromachines and those are Galoob as well if I remember right.

1031
01:01:46,934 --> 01:01:50,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think Micromachines are now put out under the Hasbro label.

1032
01:01:50,777 --> 01:01:51,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1033
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:52,318
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they probably bought it up.

1034
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,822
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't say Micromachines, it's not the real thing.

1035
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,524
[SPEAKER_01]: What ever happened to that guy that talks really fast?

1036
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:01,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he still alive?

1037
01:02:01,404 --> 01:02:02,005
[SPEAKER_07]: He died.

1038
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:03,366
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he's alive.

1039
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:07,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I always get him confused with the guy who is the Scatman.

1040
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:08,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1041
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:10,192
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy died.

1042
01:02:10,212 --> 01:02:10,992
[SPEAKER_02]: John Machida.

1043
01:02:11,012 --> 01:02:11,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1044
01:02:11,252 --> 01:02:11,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that his name?

1045
01:02:11,873 --> 01:02:13,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I get them mixed up.

1046
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:15,874
[SPEAKER_07]: They not only look similar, but you know... Scatman Crothers.

1047
01:02:15,914 --> 01:02:18,976
[SPEAKER_07]: The Scatman guy looks like the Micro Machines guy.

1048
01:02:19,556 --> 01:02:19,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

1049
01:02:20,016 --> 01:02:22,337
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean the one from the video.

1050
01:02:22,357 --> 01:02:22,757
[SPEAKER_02]: That one.

1051
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:23,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Scatman Crothers is...

1052
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:27,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I crazy?

1053
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:32,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Surely people remember the Scatman song.

1054
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:34,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us some more stuff, Rob.

1055
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:43,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of companies and all this crazy bankruptcy and whatever's going on, this isn't bankruptcy, but it's an acquisition.

1056
01:02:43,365 --> 01:02:46,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently Namco Bandai is looking to acquire D3.

1057
01:02:46,866 --> 01:02:50,468
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to buy all of D3's stock, apparently.

1058
01:02:50,548 --> 01:02:51,048
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a

1059
01:02:51,668 --> 01:03:07,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Namco has already apparently made some deals with the board over at D3 they're going to have a 70% stake in the company I guess they already have it they're going to purchase the remaining 30% at about $680 a share they're going to have controlling interest in the Naruto property

1060
01:03:08,298 --> 01:03:11,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, doesn't D3 also make Onichimaru?

1061
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:18,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they do a lot of the ports of the simple series games, which really, I don't know who the Japanese companies are that make these, but they need to pump out more of them.

1062
01:03:19,103 --> 01:03:21,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see Zombies vs. Ambulances over here.

1063
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:23,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when Namco was great?

1064
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're just watering it down.

1065
01:03:26,767 --> 01:03:30,929
[SPEAKER_04]: First they poured in a big bucket of Namco, or a Bandai, and I mean...

1066
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:32,746
[SPEAKER_04]: NAMCO Bandai

1067
01:03:43,777 --> 01:04:11,174
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's funny you bring that up because they're actually saying that D3 could benefit from especially the Bandai arm they make the toys, TV, arcade they make all this other stuff, movies and stuff that could actually maybe help D3 that maybe we could get, I don't know, Oni Chambara the TV show that would be kind of awesome actually bring the movie over that's right maybe we could get some Bikini Samurais in Tekken there you go that'd be kind of cool that'd be very cool

1068
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:17,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't we have another Klonoa?

1069
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:19,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Remake to Wii or something?

1070
01:04:19,054 --> 01:04:19,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's coming out.

1071
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:20,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We need new Klonoa.

1072
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Next few months, May, I think.

1073
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:23,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Klonoa's awesome.

1074
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:24,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

1075
01:04:25,322 --> 01:04:27,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about more acquisition news?

1076
01:04:30,342 --> 01:04:35,450
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Squeenix is trying to make a purchase.

1077
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:41,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And Squeenix has done a lot of things that have made us go, what, over.

1078
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:44,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are trying to purchase Eidos.

1079
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:55,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're trying to basically buy it for more than it's worth using 129% over their current market value.

1080
01:04:57,472 --> 01:05:01,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at grabby, grabby Squeenix.

1081
01:05:02,974 --> 01:05:05,175
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at 80 style takeover.

1082
01:05:08,516 --> 01:05:10,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want it.

1083
01:05:11,057 --> 01:05:11,898
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get it.

1084
01:05:12,078 --> 01:05:13,358
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what Squeenix does.

1085
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:14,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ours.

1086
01:05:17,148 --> 01:05:26,852
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I do have to say that Kotaku is my hero for using a picture of dead Eris to advertise this.

1087
01:05:28,212 --> 01:05:33,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes me quite happy.

1088
01:05:33,634 --> 01:05:44,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of an interesting merger, if you think about it, with the whole Tomb Raider series kind of going... I don't know, what else does Eidos have over there?

1089
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:46,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember some of the other big stuff they publish.

1090
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Hitman, if there are any more of those.

1091
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:52,781
[SPEAKER_08]: They have Just Cause coming out at some point.

1092
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:56,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Just Cause 2 at least.

1093
01:05:56,862 --> 01:06:00,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, because those are the types of games Squeenix never really seems to get involved with.

1094
01:06:00,863 --> 01:06:06,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be a very interesting sort of merger, especially if Squeenix is really wanting to get into the Western development or whatever.

1095
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:09,486
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are killing me with this Squeenix thing, by the way.

1096
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1097
01:06:10,006 --> 01:06:10,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Squeenix.

1098
01:06:11,626 --> 01:06:12,626
[SPEAKER_07]: We like to call it Squeenix.

1099
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:14,367
[SPEAKER_03]: The goddamn company's called Enix!

1100
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:16,058
[SPEAKER_07]: You're killing me.

1101
01:06:16,098 --> 01:06:17,600
[SPEAKER_07]: You're killing me.

1102
01:06:42,218 --> 01:06:43,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you might get Psygnosis out of me.

1103
01:06:44,019 --> 01:06:44,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Kanan Lynch!

1104
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

1105
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

1106
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Kanan Lynch, yeah!

1107
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:49,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they have, what is it, Battlestations?

1108
01:06:50,122 --> 01:06:54,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that series, so the Battlestations Pacific or something is coming out.

1109
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's nothing that's really exciting.

1110
01:06:58,287 --> 01:07:00,588
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Tomb Raider is kind of what they have.

1111
01:07:01,248 --> 01:07:03,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, maybe Hitman?

1112
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:09,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Although you gotta wonder about the viability of the Hitman franchise, because they didn't even bring out a game to go with its really crappy movie.

1113
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:10,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1114
01:07:11,255 --> 01:07:13,157
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do with that company?

1115
01:07:14,137 --> 01:07:15,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider RPG?

1116
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:17,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1117
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it would save the franchise a little bit.

1118
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:23,604
[SPEAKER_07]: AlphaCanadagram in chat suggests it's called Square Anus.

1119
01:07:24,265 --> 01:07:29,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't even guess on NX, because NX is an awesome company.

1120
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:31,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And Square used to be great, too.

1121
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:35,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the bizarre combination of them that just has fallen into RPG hell.

1122
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when Square made Einhander?

1123
01:07:38,195 --> 01:07:40,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when Enix made fucking Actraiser?

1124
01:07:40,776 --> 01:07:42,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and Enix made Actraiser.

1125
01:07:42,397 --> 01:07:45,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And Illusion of Gaia and that whole series.

1126
01:07:45,439 --> 01:07:46,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Secret of Mana.

1127
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:48,240
[SPEAKER_03]: We need another Tobal game.

1128
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:48,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Bust a Move.

1129
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Tobal, Tobal number one.

1130
01:07:50,401 --> 01:07:51,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Bust a Move.

1131
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:52,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Enix made Bust a Move.

1132
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:55,103
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, those companies used to make great games.

1133
01:07:55,163 --> 01:08:00,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's just rehash old RPGs, bring out new crappy JRPGs, you know.

1134
01:08:00,726 --> 01:08:01,547
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1135
01:08:23,803 --> 01:08:25,324
[SPEAKER_07]: and then they danced their way out of it.

1136
01:08:25,444 --> 01:08:26,484
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was awesome.

1137
01:08:26,504 --> 01:08:27,825
[SPEAKER_07]: That game was beyond awesome.

1138
01:08:27,845 --> 01:08:30,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that one of the attacks was that Strike would shoot at you.

1139
01:08:30,366 --> 01:08:33,187
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I just gave you... We should play it right now.

1140
01:08:33,267 --> 01:08:38,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Squenix, I gave you the new tagline, Bust a Move 3, Beyond Awesome.

1141
01:08:38,889 --> 01:08:39,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Bust a Move.

1142
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance or bust a cap in your ass.

1143
01:08:42,171 --> 01:08:43,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Bust a cap.

1144
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:45,652
[SPEAKER_07]: You got served.

1145
01:08:46,172 --> 01:08:49,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma says, God damn it, Square Enix, I want Rad Racer 3.

1146
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:52,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Rad Racer rules.

1147
01:08:54,108 --> 01:08:56,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Only if it has 3D when you hit the select button.

1148
01:08:56,930 --> 01:09:00,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you've got to be able to change the tracks and the Nintendo music has to be there.

1149
01:09:00,714 --> 01:09:04,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Which in this day and age, it might actually be kind of doable with this whole stuff they're talking about 3D.

1150
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:05,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine?

1151
01:09:05,637 --> 01:09:12,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when they were talking about that the Wii's top secret thing was going to be 3D projection in your room and all this fucking bullshit?

1152
01:09:12,563 --> 01:09:14,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did we ever believe that fucking shit?

1153
01:09:14,705 --> 01:09:20,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that would be super awesome and really innovative and then they're like, no, we don't want to do that.

1154
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:23,592
[SPEAKER_04]: People love to give Nintendo way more credit than they deserve.

1155
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:26,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, forget it.

1156
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into some other stories.

1157
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:31,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1158
01:09:32,023 --> 01:09:37,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember, it's only good for Nintendo to innovate unless it will benefit their casual audience.

1159
01:09:38,849 --> 01:09:39,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, indeed.

1160
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:09,370
[SPEAKER_08]: GameFly vs. Total Access

1161
01:10:29,048 --> 01:10:29,649
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1162
01:10:47,546 --> 01:10:48,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Blockbuster had streaming.

1163
01:10:48,267 --> 01:10:48,827
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be ultimate.

1164
01:10:48,847 --> 01:10:49,908
[SPEAKER_08]: The Netflix streaming is awesome.

1165
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:13,263
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a rumor, though, that they're going to somehow incorporate this into the PlayStation Network.

1166
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:15,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, please let this be true.

1167
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:20,625
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if that's actually going to happen or not, but it's rumored that maybe they're thinking about it.

1168
01:11:20,765 --> 01:11:25,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony can't do anything that cool anymore, so don't bet on it.

1169
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:27,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony will find a way to screw it up.

1170
01:11:27,586 --> 01:11:29,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they would prove you wrong on that.

1171
01:11:29,687 --> 01:11:33,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be great, though, if you were walking around at home and you could walk up to your TV and turn it on.

1172
01:11:34,608 --> 01:11:36,852
[SPEAKER_04]: and your total access menu would come up.

1173
01:11:37,533 --> 01:11:40,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I could just bypass that whole bullshit and just hit a button.

1174
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:44,064
[SPEAKER_04]: You could make your dude sit down and watch it and look bored.

1175
01:11:44,445 --> 01:11:45,467
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'd be awesome.

1176
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And then smoke a bowl.

1177
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch Cheech and Chong on Bloodbuster.

1178
01:11:53,247 --> 01:11:58,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really interesting if they had context-sensitive reactions.

1179
01:11:58,488 --> 01:12:00,909
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they watch a sad movie, they'll sit there and cry.

1180
01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:06,110
[SPEAKER_04]: If they watch Cheech and Chong, they'll sit there and neck-toke, which would be hilarious.

1181
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:07,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Not likely, but hilarious.

1182
01:12:08,051 --> 01:12:09,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just think that would be pretty cool.

1183
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:13,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, somehow I don't think that would get by like the Sony sensors or what have you.

1184
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:16,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think the smoking dope thing would happen.

1185
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, having your little dude watch TV.

1186
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:19,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

1187
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:22,583
[SPEAKER_04]: A bajillion freaking people play The Sims.

1188
01:12:23,064 --> 01:12:25,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they watch their Sims do nothing.

1189
01:12:25,366 --> 01:12:26,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want that.

1190
01:12:26,647 --> 01:12:27,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Home bullshit.

1191
01:12:27,948 --> 01:12:28,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't use it.

1192
01:12:28,608 --> 01:12:29,268
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to.

1193
01:12:29,288 --> 01:12:30,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying it would be cool if it was there.

1194
01:12:31,529 --> 01:12:32,189
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

1195
01:12:32,249 --> 01:12:33,050
[SPEAKER_07]: You're missing the point.

1196
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:35,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so I could see it that one time and go, wow, that's fucking cool.

1197
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:36,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm done.

1198
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:37,291
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1199
01:12:37,492 --> 01:12:37,832
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1200
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:38,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

1201
01:12:38,432 --> 01:12:40,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a stream saver for your life.

1202
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:45,455
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called how many millions of dollars does Sony have to spend to get me to say, wow, that's fucking cool.

1203
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:46,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Next.

1204
01:12:46,435 --> 01:12:50,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if it makes someone say, wow, that's fucking cool enough for me to buy a PS3.

1205
01:12:51,177 --> 01:12:51,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

1206
01:12:51,838 --> 01:12:54,459
[SPEAKER_04]: How many systems has Nintendo sold with the controller?

1207
01:12:55,379 --> 01:12:56,240
[SPEAKER_04]: for the Wii.

1208
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,141
[SPEAKER_04]: People are like, ooh, I can wave my hand.

1209
01:12:58,201 --> 01:12:58,702
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

1210
01:12:58,842 --> 01:12:59,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1211
01:12:59,322 --> 01:13:01,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It really sucks for actual gameplay.

1212
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:02,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really sad.

1213
01:13:05,387 --> 01:13:05,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1214
01:13:06,108 --> 01:13:06,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what to tell you.

1215
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:13,215
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, you can look for that blockbuster thing coming soon, I guess.

1216
01:13:13,696 --> 01:13:14,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully.

1217
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:15,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that now?

1218
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:16,198
[SPEAKER_07]: That you can do the game thing now?

1219
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:18,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's very soon, if not now.

1220
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:22,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of want to do that, but I still want Netflix, too, for streaming.

1221
01:13:23,025 --> 01:13:24,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Just... Quandary.

1222
01:13:24,646 --> 01:13:25,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want both.

1223
01:13:25,387 --> 01:13:26,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too much money.

1224
01:13:26,628 --> 01:13:26,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow...

1225
01:13:27,509 --> 01:13:30,270
[SPEAKER_08]: or just, I don't know, go rent a movie.

1226
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:31,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the other thing.

1227
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:40,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's what you got to do is if you change your address or whatever, like Hollywood Video will send you a bunch of these like, you know, welcome to the neighborhood and rent a free game or free movie thing.

1228
01:13:40,952 --> 01:13:47,614
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister has like moved apartments in her complex a few times and she's got like a ton of those things and she keeps bouncing from different Hollywood videos.

1229
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,196
[SPEAKER_08]: because I'll let her do it over and over and over again.

1230
01:13:50,376 --> 01:13:56,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if she hasn't read anything from a Hollywood video for a while, they'll eventually call her and say, hey, do you want a free rental?

1231
01:13:56,381 --> 01:13:57,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Come back in the store type thing.

1232
01:13:57,882 --> 01:14:00,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So she bounces between three different Hollywood videos and they keep sending her those.

1233
01:14:01,585 --> 01:14:01,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1234
01:14:02,246 --> 01:14:06,289
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like entirely too much effort to save the five, six bucks.

1235
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,270
[SPEAKER_04]: She's poor, so yeah.

1236
01:14:07,491 --> 01:14:08,171
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't care.

1237
01:14:08,331 --> 01:14:09,432
[SPEAKER_04]: She's poor, so yeah.

1238
01:14:09,472 --> 01:14:10,033
[SPEAKER_04]: She's poor.

1239
01:14:10,053 --> 01:14:11,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Entertainment, however I can get it.

1240
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:12,895
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1241
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:18,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, the DS Lite Onyx version, that would be the black one for most of us.

1242
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:19,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Call it the black DS Lite.

1243
01:14:19,043 --> 01:14:20,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does it have to be a black thing?

1244
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:21,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, shut up.

1245
01:14:21,645 --> 01:14:24,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, it has been discontinued.

1246
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:26,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo is keeping the black system down.

1247
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:29,032
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the rumor going on.

1248
01:14:29,953 --> 01:14:32,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki is confirming it's happened.

1249
01:14:33,437 --> 01:14:36,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo is discontinuing the Onyx DS Lite.

1250
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,881
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a rare system then.

1251
01:14:38,001 --> 01:14:39,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Black DS Lite.

1252
01:14:39,181 --> 01:14:40,342
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going out the door.

1253
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the only four colors left.

1254
01:14:43,862 --> 01:14:48,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Metallic Silver, Metallic Rose, Black and Cobalt Blue, and Black and Crimson Red.

1255
01:14:49,304 --> 01:14:54,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Pink, Pinker, Pinkest, and Very Pink are the four colors that are left of the DS.

1256
01:14:57,906 --> 01:14:58,086
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1257
01:15:00,126 --> 01:15:09,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this because maybe there's like, you know, and this is kind of the thought process going around, that a DSi is coming relatively soon-ish, and that the DSi is going to be black?

1258
01:15:09,808 --> 01:15:13,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily, because they did the same thing with the white DS.

1259
01:15:13,129 --> 01:15:19,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just after a while they just want to stop making, you know, a certain color.

1260
01:15:19,730 --> 01:15:21,071
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know.

1261
01:15:22,171 --> 01:15:25,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Because five colors is too many, but four is just right, I guess.

1262
01:15:26,052 --> 01:15:26,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

1263
01:15:27,796 --> 01:15:32,978
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura has dug through the Classic Game Archive, I'm assuming with Dan's help a little bit this week, and has picked one game to highlight for you folks on the show tonight.

1264
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:33,718
[SPEAKER_07]: What game have you picked?

1265
01:15:57,287 --> 01:16:02,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's game is The Revenge of Shinobi, and Dan did inspire me to pick it.

1266
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:14,316
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little bit of a conversation last night about copyrighted characters making their way into different releases of this game, so I thought it would be worth mentioning.

1267
01:16:16,097 --> 01:16:17,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, it does have some pretty cool music.

1268
01:16:18,759 --> 01:16:18,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1269
01:16:23,043 --> 01:16:40,517
[SPEAKER_02]: This soundtrack is by Yuzo Koshiro, and it's actually, you can also find it in the Mega Games 2, Mega Drive 6-Pack, Sega Classics Arcade Collection for Sega CD, and the Sega Smash Pack for PC and Dreamcast.

1270
01:16:42,378 --> 01:16:44,880
[SPEAKER_04]: But not on Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Projects.

1271
01:16:47,450 --> 01:17:01,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it is saying that the introductory game screen has Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo from the Kage no Gundan series.

1272
01:17:02,002 --> 01:17:04,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it is a side-scrolling platform game.

1273
01:17:04,845 --> 01:17:05,105
[SPEAKER_02]: You can

1274
01:17:05,285 --> 01:17:13,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Control Joe Musashi, and go through 8th districts, and you actually have to defeat the head of Neo Zeed.

1275
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:25,448
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three scenes in each level with their own boss characters, and you use the D-pad, A, B, and C buttons to do your ninjutsu attack, your regular attack, and your jump.

1276
01:17:26,329 --> 01:17:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: and you also have a somersault move that you can press the jump button and then press it again at the height of your jump so that you can jump more and throw 8 shuriken in the air at the same time.

1277
01:17:41,027 --> 01:17:41,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1278
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:56,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you can actually go, uh, over different layers in the area, like you can be in the foreground, in the background, indoor, outdoor, um, or on the highway or next to it with the somersault move.

1279
01:17:57,846 --> 01:18:00,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you have, um, different ninjutsu techniques.

1280
01:18:01,008 --> 01:18:09,051
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got, um, uh, ninjutsu no, um, Ikezuchi, um, Karyu, Fushin, and Mijin.

1281
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:19,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And respectively, um, the first one's lightning, the second one's flame, the third one is, like, more jumping, and that last one is explosions.

1282
01:18:19,977 --> 01:18:23,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually costs you one life, but, um...

1283
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,281
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a life, then you can't do it.

1284
01:18:27,901 --> 01:18:33,425
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have bonus crates that have stuff hidden in them, so you can just go beat up stuff.

1285
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:39,329
[SPEAKER_02]: It has easy, normal, hard, and hardest, just meaning more enemies and a shorter life bar.

1286
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:48,596
[SPEAKER_02]: The Japanese version, called the Super Shinobi, there are options for no death and level select.

1287
01:18:50,186 --> 01:19:06,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So the different stages is Ibaraki Province, Japan, Tokyo, the Military Base, Detroit, Area Code 818, Chinatown, New York, and Neo-Zeroine Stronghold.

1288
01:19:07,093 --> 01:19:09,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we come to the different versions.

1289
01:19:09,334 --> 01:19:13,075
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was mentioning, there are different copyrighted characters in the different versions.

1290
01:19:15,556 --> 01:19:16,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you had one.

1291
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we have one?

1292
01:19:18,035 --> 01:19:21,238
[SPEAKER_04]: This game, just so everyone knows, is fucking awesome.

1293
01:19:21,818 --> 01:19:25,001
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the reason to buy a Genesis back in the day.

1294
01:19:25,121 --> 01:19:40,834
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that was so great about it, besides the fact that it's got brutal, unforgiving difficulty if you don't puss it out and play on easy, is that as you play through the game, you ran into, like, classic movie enemies.

1295
01:19:41,794 --> 01:19:45,177
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a boss who was Spider-Man, and he stayed as Spider-Man.

1296
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:46,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega had a Spider-Man license.

1297
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:52,823
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you beat up on Spider-Man for a while, he would crawl off the screen, and he would come back, and it was Batman.

1298
01:19:53,523 --> 01:19:59,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, if it wasn't, you know, it wasn't a licensed Batman, but it would just like Batman.

1299
01:19:59,888 --> 01:20:08,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And in one of the subsequent re-releases of the same cartridge, it was the same game, they replaced him with, you know, a Batman, not Batman.

1300
01:20:08,915 --> 01:20:10,557
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the enemies looks like Rambo.

1301
01:20:10,998 --> 01:20:14,942
[SPEAKER_04]: They took off his hair and later released him, so he didn't look like Rambo anymore.

1302
01:20:15,623 --> 01:20:19,667
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and there's a guy who looks like there's a Terminator.

1303
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:21,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he looks like Schwarzenegger.

1304
01:20:21,869 --> 01:20:27,596
[SPEAKER_04]: When you hit him, his skin starts coming off, and he's a cyborg underneath, and he blows up Terminator-style.

1305
01:20:28,136 --> 01:20:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, there's Godzilla.

1306
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:40,553
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's, you know, Godzilla, you know, towering and breathing fire and they replaced him with a, like a weird skeleton.

1307
01:20:40,893 --> 01:20:42,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Mechagodzilla, which would have been even cooler.

1308
01:20:43,234 --> 01:20:48,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that that might be part of the reason why it missed out on the Mega Genesis collection thing that just came out?

1309
01:20:48,216 --> 01:20:52,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that maybe these strange licensed bosses kept it out of the collection?

1310
01:20:52,357 --> 01:20:52,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It's strange.

1311
01:20:52,637 --> 01:20:53,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching.

1312
01:20:53,377 --> 01:20:54,378
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

1313
01:21:15,336 --> 01:21:17,397
[SPEAKER_04]: for the Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.

1314
01:21:17,737 --> 01:21:23,439
[SPEAKER_04]: They recolored the quote-unquote Spider-Man enemies from red and blue to yellow and blue.

1315
01:21:23,939 --> 01:21:28,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, probably a little bit of, you know, hey, don't want to get sued by Marvel this time around.

1316
01:21:30,868 --> 01:21:32,429
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure that that's what it is.

1317
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:43,353
[SPEAKER_04]: But the real pity of that is that this would have been just an awesome chance, you know, to have the Shinobi 1, 2, and 3 all at hand.

1318
01:21:44,174 --> 01:21:50,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that is the one bummer because with so many complete Sega franchises there, it's kind of a bummer to have this one missing.

1319
01:21:50,516 --> 01:21:53,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But did you notice there's one other big franchise that's missing?

1320
01:21:53,418 --> 01:21:53,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Strider.

1321
01:21:55,263 --> 01:21:56,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's Capcom.

1322
01:21:56,825 --> 01:21:57,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

1323
01:21:57,525 --> 01:21:58,126
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Sega.

1324
01:21:58,486 --> 01:21:59,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Sega did it.

1325
01:22:00,088 --> 01:22:01,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been thinking about this.

1326
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:01,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1327
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:08,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something that I can kind of go off about because on Ultimate Genesis Collection, I mean, it's far from the Ultimate Genesis Collection.

1328
01:22:08,997 --> 01:22:14,302
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great, great collection, but it's got some clunkers that they could have replaced with.

1329
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:19,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Way better Sega games, and I'm sure that that's being saved for Sonic's even more Ultimate Genesis Collection 2.

1330
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:23,485
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, there was no Shadow Dancer, The Secret of Shinobi.

1331
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:27,086
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you could have had more arcade unlockables.

1332
01:22:27,126 --> 01:22:31,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you had, you know, if you played Shinobi 3, you unlocked Shinobi 1, which was great.

1333
01:22:31,527 --> 01:22:32,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so happy.

1334
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:37,349
[SPEAKER_04]: But wouldn't it have been really cool to have been able to play Shadow Dancer and then unlock the arcade version of Shadow Dancer?

1335
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:43,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it have been great to have been able to have unlocked, you know, maybe have had OutRun on there?

1336
01:22:43,823 --> 01:22:45,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I was missing, huh?

1337
01:22:45,784 --> 01:23:12,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just Thunder Blade, you know, they had Super Thunder Blade, but not the way better arcade Thunder Blade, After Burner, I mean, there were so many significant, I mean, that thing could have had 30 more games, and then arcade versions of those same games, and it just would have been just fantastic, but I guess you can't expect Sega to give away the company for 30 bucks, I expect though, so they should have done it, but yeah, it would have been really cool to have just had the whole Shinobi franchise in one place, which

1338
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:41,789
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, had the lock on technology with the Sonic and that but, you know, back to Revenge of Shinobi it's awesome if you have a Sega Genesis kicking around it's a super common cartridge you might get lucky find that you have one of the early release cartridges with all the all the bosses even the one I had back in the day had the Rambo guys edited the one I have now actually does have the Rambo guys so I was pretty stoked when I was playing it super, super awesome game really hard

1339
01:23:43,044 --> 01:23:44,425
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more changes, actually.

1340
01:23:45,286 --> 01:24:01,641
[SPEAKER_02]: They also did, for release 1.02, which was the last release, they also did put up an acknowledgement of the Spider-Man copyright, and there was only one ending you had to save now to win the game.

1341
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:05,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the way that you get the ending in that game is totally cool.

1342
01:24:06,045 --> 01:24:07,286
[SPEAKER_04]: You get into the final level...

1343
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:10,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, I mean, I'm sure a lot of people have done it.

1344
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:14,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, when you play, when you talk to people online, you always find out that the game you thought you were a botto at.

1345
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:16,138
[SPEAKER_04]: People are better.

1346
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:25,289
[SPEAKER_04]: But to get the final ending, you had to fight the boss while your girl ran around in the background and a giant cement block lowered towards her.

1347
01:24:26,184 --> 01:24:26,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, um...

1348
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an European version.

1349
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:04,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The shuriken is replaced by throwing knives because of legal status at the time.

1350
01:25:06,855 --> 01:25:06,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1351
01:25:08,826 --> 01:25:11,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool, actually.

1352
01:25:12,189 --> 01:25:18,373
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of the music was performed at the 4th Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig.

1353
01:25:19,234 --> 01:25:23,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also performed at two of the concerts of Play in Stockholm.

1354
01:25:24,878 --> 01:25:33,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also at the same Play concert in Singapore in June 2007.

1355
01:25:35,126 --> 01:25:35,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1356
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:40,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for Revenge of Shinobi.

1357
01:25:40,588 --> 01:25:45,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, there you got it.

1358
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:48,852
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as game music goes too, this made Yuzo Kishiro.

1359
01:25:49,072 --> 01:25:51,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're into game music, you know who Yuzo Kishiro is.

1360
01:25:52,993 --> 01:25:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're really interested in his work and you haven't played Revenge of Shinobi, what are you doing?

1361
01:25:58,382 --> 01:26:03,730
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely one of the most notable missing games from the Genesis Collection just recently came out.

1362
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:11,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Revenge of Shinobi is the Classic Game of the Week, so you'll have to check it out somehow else besides the Classic Game Collection for those of you guys checking that out this week.

1363
01:26:11,822 --> 01:26:13,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Good pick, DarkSakura and Dan.

1364
01:26:14,746 --> 01:26:16,808
[SPEAKER_07]: This week on the Classic Game of the Week.

1365
01:26:17,348 --> 01:26:20,351
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is going to bring to a close, as it always does, part A of our program.

1366
01:26:20,371 --> 01:26:21,192
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't go anywhere.

1367
01:26:21,232 --> 01:26:25,215
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be right back after a little break with some more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1368
01:26:25,235 --> 01:26:28,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And in part B tonight, we're going to be talking a little bit about the new website.

1369
01:26:28,698 --> 01:26:30,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's some exciting new information.

1370
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:40,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk a little bit about Fear 2, Grand Theft Auto 4, more Sega, if you can believe it, and some very interesting trademarks, Persona 4, and Konami.

1371
01:26:40,689 --> 01:26:42,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting a little taste of their own medicine this week.

1372
01:26:42,673 --> 01:26:45,359
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be talking about that also a little bit right after the break.

1373
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So stay tuned.

1374
01:26:46,341 --> 01:26:49,568
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back more in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1375
01:26:55,734 --> 01:27:03,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 15th of 2009, the day after Valentine's Day.

1376
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:07,421
[SPEAKER_07]: And here in studio, unfortunately JTV stopped working.

1377
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:11,403
[SPEAKER_07]: We were having problems on the server end, so we just decided to say, screw it.

1378
01:27:11,843 --> 01:27:31,765
[SPEAKER_07]: and we hooked up Street Fighter 4 which is what we're playing right now on the in-studio TV we will try to get it up on Justin TV if we're able to get back on there we already tried reconnecting it didn't work it's on there and it's something so I guess some JTV channels are up but not us but we'll be back on Justin TV hopefully soon and it's just going to be footage of Street Fighter 4 with us talking so that should be interesting

1379
01:27:32,626 --> 01:27:33,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1380
01:27:57,155 --> 01:28:03,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that one of the best characters in the game, well, one of the most fun characters in the game is just a total joke.

1381
01:28:04,628 --> 01:28:05,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very nice, though.

1382
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:08,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say this as well in the chat.

1383
01:28:08,692 --> 01:28:13,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And SSJ100Matt reminded me of this, although I swear I was going to say something about this at the top of Part B as well.

1384
01:28:14,216 --> 01:28:17,519
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a swag bag from our New York City contingent.

1385
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:21,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Specifically, SSJ100Matt, I believe, put this all together for us.

1386
01:28:21,282 --> 01:28:22,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if he had some help or what have you.

1387
01:28:22,944 --> 01:28:31,091
[SPEAKER_07]: But we want to say a big, big thank you to them for getting us some of the swag, including lots of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars stuff.

1388
01:28:31,111 --> 01:28:32,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Which Loki took it all.

1389
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,092
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1390
01:28:53,727 --> 01:28:55,628
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki, why don't you start us off with some news?

1391
01:28:55,688 --> 01:28:59,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually want to run in the house and get some tea, so Street Fighter 4 will have to wait.

1392
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:03,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Dan doesn't want to give it up anyway, so why don't you get into some news, Loki?

1393
01:29:03,712 --> 01:29:12,896
[SPEAKER_08]: He has to unlock me and the other two characters, so... Anyways, Fear 2, they had some pretty interesting advertisement for Fear 2.

1394
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:16,958
[SPEAKER_08]: In the UK, actually, they had trained black cats.

1395
01:29:17,578 --> 01:29:19,139
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1396
01:29:41,024 --> 01:29:44,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm surprised, but, you know, that they didn't have their own agenda.

1397
01:29:44,487 --> 01:29:51,632
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, anyways, what's even cooler is if you happen to live in the UK, there's a number you can call to get your own Fear 2 cat shirt.

1398
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:56,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally, okay, for our UK listeners, somebody get me a shirt for Shermie.

1399
01:29:59,839 --> 01:30:02,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, make sure it's a 3XL cat size.

1400
01:30:03,442 --> 01:30:05,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Shermie is a fat fucking cat.

1401
01:30:05,883 --> 01:30:06,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my cat.

1402
01:30:06,764 --> 01:30:07,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1403
01:30:07,245 --> 01:30:10,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will put it on her and model her.

1404
01:30:11,187 --> 01:30:12,468
[SPEAKER_02]: with the fear shirt on.

1405
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:14,429
[SPEAKER_08]: You could just probably get like a blank.

1406
01:30:14,449 --> 01:30:16,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you could make a pattern.

1407
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I want an official fear shirt for my cat.

1408
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:21,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

1409
01:30:21,034 --> 01:30:22,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on it's probably Dolphy sized.

1410
01:30:26,894 --> 01:30:27,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1411
01:30:48,221 --> 01:30:49,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's awesome.

1412
01:30:49,482 --> 01:30:52,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I would put one of these on my cat if she wouldn't claw me to death.

1413
01:30:52,664 --> 01:30:57,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohaze20 in chat asks, My cat talks and smokes a lot of pot.

1414
01:30:57,767 --> 01:30:59,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that eligible for cat shows?

1415
01:30:59,608 --> 01:30:59,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone?

1416
01:30:59,888 --> 01:31:00,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1417
01:31:00,228 --> 01:31:01,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I might get a disqualified.

1418
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:07,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the cat actually smoke pot or do you blow pot smoke in the cat's face?

1419
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:09,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be for the Stoned Olympics.

1420
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:10,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That it talks to you.

1421
01:31:10,996 --> 01:31:13,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Eddie Izzard talked about the Stoned Olympics.

1422
01:31:14,921 --> 01:31:15,462
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

1423
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:16,484
[SPEAKER_02]: The Stoned Olympics.

1424
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:17,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I've not heard of this.

1425
01:31:17,365 --> 01:31:20,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you're tested for drugs to make sure that you've taken enough.

1426
01:31:20,109 --> 01:31:20,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

1427
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that Orin Sanche would condone this.

1428
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:24,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Drugs are bad, okay?

1429
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,379
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1430
01:31:52,957 --> 01:31:54,118
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Midnight Jungle.

1431
01:31:54,199 --> 01:31:55,260
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Blanca's stage, I think.

1432
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:55,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I see.

1433
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:55,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1434
01:31:56,581 --> 01:32:00,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, it's going to be like this for the whole second half of the show tonight.

1435
01:32:00,484 --> 01:32:02,206
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1436
01:32:03,207 --> 01:32:05,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto IV Lost in the Dam not only is a...

1437
01:32:07,668 --> 01:32:14,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only is it coming with, of course, all the great download content, a free week of multiplayer from the 17th to the 22nd.

1438
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:17,492
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called a Game with Rockstar event.

1439
01:32:18,092 --> 01:32:22,154
[SPEAKER_07]: You can play The Lost and the Damned online for free if you don't have Xbox Live Gold.

1440
01:32:22,574 --> 01:32:27,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'm surprised there's that many folks out there that have this game and not have Xbox Live Gold, but I guess there's enough.

1441
01:32:28,236 --> 01:32:29,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

1442
01:32:29,517 --> 01:32:34,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, really, you need it online anyways because, I mean, there's not much to do if you don't have it and you beat the game.

1443
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:35,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

1444
01:32:36,414 --> 01:32:43,580
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's weird, though, because even this game, when Saints Row 2 came out, I'm like, I'm going to be playing Saints Row 2 a lot more than Grand Theft Auto 4.

1445
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:44,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the case.

1446
01:32:45,321 --> 01:32:46,222
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so weird.

1447
01:32:46,942 --> 01:32:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

1448
01:32:50,652 --> 01:32:51,012
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1449
01:32:51,713 --> 01:32:53,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm going to have to interrupt here.

1450
01:32:53,474 --> 01:33:02,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that DarkSakura is dying to do a story here, but I have an OLR special bulletin, if you will.

1451
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:05,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I need the theme music for when we have special bulletins.

1452
01:33:05,145 --> 01:33:05,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have?

1453
01:33:06,065 --> 01:33:08,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have a little trumpet announcement thing we used to do.

1454
01:33:10,209 --> 01:33:11,010
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this, Rob?

1455
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:11,430
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1456
01:33:14,152 --> 01:33:14,593
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll work.

1457
01:33:15,453 --> 01:33:16,715
[SPEAKER_07]: The new website is live.

1458
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:26,894
[SPEAKER_07]: So check it out, www.orangeloungeradio.com And there it is, orangeloungeradio.com is up So check it out You know what that earns?

1459
01:33:27,475 --> 01:33:27,696
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1460
01:33:30,376 --> 01:33:32,517
[SPEAKER_07]: No, in all reality, though, I'm actually loading it up right now.

1461
01:33:32,557 --> 01:33:43,325
[SPEAKER_07]: In all reality, we want to say a big, big, big, big, big thank you to Deekman and VXJasonXV for their hard work on getting the new website up and running.

1462
01:33:43,345 --> 01:33:44,045
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean it isn't?

1463
01:33:44,065 --> 01:33:45,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking at it right now.

1464
01:33:45,686 --> 01:33:46,347
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks great.

1465
01:33:46,727 --> 01:33:50,209
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys so much for everybody that put that together.

1466
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:51,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

1467
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:53,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has a little Space Invader.

1468
01:33:53,772 --> 01:33:57,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And as TigerClaw says in chat, it's much easier on the eyes than the old site.

1469
01:33:58,615 --> 01:33:59,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, maybe there was some...

1470
01:34:00,996 --> 01:34:03,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I am posting photographic proof

1471
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:34,373
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura right now is taking pictures of us playing Street Fighter 4 here in studio and she's going to upload them to the OL Army Picks gallery so you have something to check out.

1472
01:34:34,413 --> 01:34:35,894
[SPEAKER_07]: There's DarkTetsuya with an old-ass pinball table.

1473
01:34:57,731 --> 01:34:58,632
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1474
01:35:30,077 --> 01:35:35,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega re-registered the trademarks for Rez and 18-wheeler American Pro Trucker.

1475
01:35:35,799 --> 01:35:38,300
[SPEAKER_02]: They were Dreamcast titles, as you might recall.

1476
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:44,142
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, we've also got the Rez Remix thingamadookie, right?

1477
01:35:45,082 --> 01:35:45,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Thingamadookie?

1478
01:35:46,563 --> 01:35:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Rez HD Remix thingamadookie?

1479
01:35:48,283 --> 01:35:50,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for MatchingService.com.

1480
01:35:52,244 --> 01:35:53,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, we've...

1481
01:35:55,228 --> 01:36:04,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've renewed those, so who knows, we may have new truckin' action with a really poppy soundtrack.

1482
01:36:04,293 --> 01:36:07,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I'm hoping, is that they actually combine the two games, and we get 18 wheeler res.

1483
01:36:07,735 --> 01:36:09,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hold on.

1484
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:10,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

1485
01:36:11,797 --> 01:36:16,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Sakura versus Dan on Street Fighter IV, so... Unfortunately, I'm Sakura.

1486
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:19,241
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just gonna bug us all night.

1487
01:36:20,001 --> 01:36:20,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you Sakura?

1488
01:36:20,762 --> 01:36:21,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I lost.

1489
01:36:24,464 --> 01:36:29,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, who knows what interesting games could come of these remake trademarks.

1490
01:36:30,272 --> 01:36:30,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1491
01:36:31,574 --> 01:36:35,539
[SPEAKER_02]: This picture is going up because this is our daily life at home.

1492
01:36:36,621 --> 01:36:37,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan versus Sakura.

1493
01:36:37,742 --> 01:36:49,352
[SPEAKER_08]: What's interesting though, and this is kind of a rumor that's been around for a while now, in fact I remember another story about this, the Sega Vintage Collection is rumored to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1494
01:36:50,633 --> 01:36:57,820
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember a while back they had some screenshots of the Sega Vintage Collection with the Sonic the Hedgehog games or something like that.

1495
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:06,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently this vintage collection is supposed to be bringing some of the old Genesis games to Xbox Live Arcade.

1496
01:37:06,486 --> 01:37:12,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these games, you might expect, are Gunstar Heroes, Comic Zone, Altered Beasts, Shinobi 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3.

1497
01:37:15,292 --> 01:37:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but I just bought all of those games on the Mega Genesis collection, so what's the freaking point?

1498
01:37:20,276 --> 01:37:21,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Gunstar Heroes is not on it.

1499
01:37:21,817 --> 01:37:22,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, one game.

1500
01:37:24,491 --> 01:37:29,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also... Anyway, I already bought Gunstar Hero because it was one of the first virtual console games on the Wii.

1501
01:37:29,256 --> 01:37:39,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get it either, but, you know, then again, they also released Hedgehog and stuff by, you know, standalone, so maybe people want just one game and... It just... I don't see the value in that.

1502
01:37:40,366 --> 01:37:40,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know...

1503
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:43,668
[SPEAKER_07]: I see Gamer says it's on PSN as well.

1504
01:37:43,708 --> 01:37:58,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, but I have the collection thingy on PS3, so... You know, and sadly, the only way that this would actually work as far as being, you know, worthwhile is if they have those, like, say, four or five games and charge, like, maybe five or ten bucks for it or something like that.

1505
01:37:58,553 --> 01:38:01,094
[SPEAKER_08]: And then having it kind of like a mini version of that collection.

1506
01:38:01,174 --> 01:38:04,055
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it's like, what's the point?

1507
01:38:04,075 --> 01:38:07,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you can just go purchase, you know, 40 games for, you know, 30 bucks.

1508
01:38:07,957 --> 01:38:10,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can wait for the price drop and you'll get 40 games for 20 bucks.

1509
01:38:12,918 --> 01:38:13,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1510
01:38:13,598 --> 01:38:14,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know either.

1511
01:38:14,179 --> 01:38:15,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little interesting.

1512
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:17,080
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a rumor right now.

1513
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,961
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming from a Dutch gaming site.

1514
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:24,223
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's kind of weird, though, that we see two of these same types of rumors happening before.

1515
01:38:24,283 --> 01:38:25,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

1516
01:38:25,944 --> 01:38:28,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Acidic Vampire in chat says Achievement Whores will buy it.

1517
01:38:28,665 --> 01:38:29,085
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1518
01:38:29,586 --> 01:38:30,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Achievement Whores will definitely buy it.

1519
01:38:32,087 --> 01:38:32,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very true.

1520
01:38:35,339 --> 01:38:43,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, another fighting game going on out there in the world, not just Street Fighter 4, but how many of you guys are fans of WrestleMania?

1521
01:38:45,097 --> 01:38:46,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan

1522
01:39:07,558 --> 01:39:07,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.

1523
01:39:08,098 --> 01:39:11,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be like a battle game where you can fight all these people.

1524
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to give you just a sampling of the 42 characters, again, this is a rumor.

1525
01:39:16,782 --> 01:39:21,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming from NeoGAF, those forums, but hey, you know what?

1526
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:24,164
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to put together a hell of a WrestleMania game, this sounds like a good place to start.

1527
01:39:24,684 --> 01:39:35,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Andre the Giant, Bam Bam Bigelow, Big Boss Man, Bret Hart, The Hammer, Hacksaw, Hulk Hogan, Jake the Snake Roberts, Jim the Anvil, Nate Hart, uh...

1528
01:39:37,049 --> 01:39:43,354
[SPEAKER_07]: King Kong Bundy, Million Dollar Men, Mr. Fuji, Mr. Perfect, Ric Flair, Sgt.

1529
01:39:43,414 --> 01:39:47,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Slaughter, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Undertaker, Yokozuna, I mean just tons.

1530
01:39:48,237 --> 01:39:49,078
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rock, of course.

1531
01:39:49,658 --> 01:39:55,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Just some awesome, awesome... Sadly, most of which are dead.

1532
01:39:56,003 --> 01:39:58,725
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100Matt says, I played this at Comic Con.

1533
01:39:58,745 --> 01:39:59,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of fun.

1534
01:39:59,725 --> 01:40:00,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't doubt it.

1535
01:40:01,547 --> 01:40:03,188
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an ultimate fighting game right there.

1536
01:40:03,828 --> 01:40:04,689
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be a lot of fun.

1537
01:40:06,368 --> 01:40:10,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I'm not a big WrestleMania fan, I do remember the old school WrestleMania on the NES.

1538
01:40:11,011 --> 01:40:16,315
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one of the first fighting games ever that had six of those characters in it.

1539
01:40:16,335 --> 01:40:19,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Macho Man was in it, and Hulk, and Andre.

1540
01:40:21,079 --> 01:40:24,681
[SPEAKER_07]: The Million Dollar Man had a little dollar sign he had to get that was a power-up.

1541
01:40:24,801 --> 01:40:27,864
[SPEAKER_07]: There was just these dumb little things in it that made it awesome.

1542
01:40:29,365 --> 01:40:32,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of cool that WrestleMania has lasted all this time.

1543
01:40:32,867 --> 01:40:35,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't they just have their 25th anniversary or something like that?

1544
01:40:36,704 --> 01:40:37,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?

1545
01:40:37,344 --> 01:40:40,245
[SPEAKER_07]: WrestleMania had like a 25th anniversary or something just recently.

1546
01:40:40,525 --> 01:40:40,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1547
01:40:40,865 --> 01:40:41,325
[SPEAKER_08]: They had something.

1548
01:40:41,485 --> 01:40:42,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a big anniversary for it, I know.

1549
01:40:43,306 --> 01:40:47,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I'm sure somebody in chat that's a big wrestling fan will correct me momentarily.

1550
01:40:47,647 --> 01:40:48,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1551
01:40:49,088 --> 01:40:50,148
[SPEAKER_07]: WWF WrestleFest.

1552
01:40:50,168 --> 01:40:51,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was WrestleMania.

1553
01:40:54,269 --> 01:40:55,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, WrestleMania is the big one I'm thinking of.

1554
01:40:56,570 --> 01:41:00,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at any rate, how about some news from Squeenix?

1555
01:41:01,812 --> 01:41:02,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Squeenix?

1556
01:41:03,512 --> 01:41:03,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1557
01:41:05,433 --> 01:41:05,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

1558
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:17,203
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, the PlayStation 2 game Persona 4 is going to be out in the UK on March 13th.

1559
01:41:18,304 --> 01:41:23,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PAL box is going to have a special CD soundtrack with 24 tracks.

1560
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:32,135
[SPEAKER_02]: has a new plot, new places to go, new stuff to look at, new things to kill, new spookies.

1561
01:41:33,076 --> 01:41:41,539
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is the same stylized manga pop culture art to go in the game.

1562
01:41:42,799 --> 01:41:46,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So go check it out for when it's out.

1563
01:41:46,701 --> 01:41:51,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually it's supposed to be not too far off from the style of Persona 3.

1564
01:41:51,642 --> 01:41:52,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So go for it.

1565
01:41:55,641 --> 01:41:58,264
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just using the same engine for Persona 3, if I remember right.

1566
01:41:59,465 --> 01:42:00,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kind of milking money out of it.

1567
01:42:00,926 --> 01:42:01,567
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, you know what?

1568
01:42:01,667 --> 01:42:09,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's a lot of love out there for Persona 3, and I haven't played it personally, but I hear it's very in-depth, and it's pretty cool.

1569
01:42:10,075 --> 01:42:12,297
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of those games I want to check out on a rainy day somewhere.

1570
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,741
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1571
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Tortilla, but Tortilla.

1572
01:42:46,581 --> 01:42:52,685
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a fitness expert and apparently a host of some AM talk radio show called Shape Up America.

1573
01:42:53,365 --> 01:43:08,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And he has announced plans that he's going to file a class action lawsuit against Nintendo claiming that people are getting injured playing Wii games because Nintendo isn't telling people to properly warm up before doing exercise.

1574
01:43:09,298 --> 01:43:20,461
[SPEAKER_08]: He claims that Wii Fit has led to people sustaining injuries in their knees, back, and wrists because of improper warm-up.

1575
01:43:21,741 --> 01:43:22,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1576
01:43:22,101 --> 01:43:23,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is kind of a stretch.

1577
01:43:23,721 --> 01:43:32,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just like saying, oh, well, I got up and walked down the stairs, but my TV didn't tell me to warm up before I did activity.

1578
01:43:34,044 --> 01:43:35,304
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, actually...

1579
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:40,061
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that people have been doing for years.

1580
01:43:40,121 --> 01:43:53,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you do any physical activity, it's a good idea, even before stretching, it's a good idea to warm up your muscles before you even stretch or you're at risk for injury in the tendons and tissue.

1581
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:59,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just, should be common sense, the stuff that they teach you when you're in school.

1582
01:43:59,761 --> 01:44:00,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1583
01:44:18,464 --> 01:44:20,726
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not their fault.

1584
01:44:20,826 --> 01:44:25,890
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the fault of people playing it that are getting way too into the game and hurting themselves.

1585
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:29,773
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 in the chatroom has a good point at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

1586
01:44:29,813 --> 01:44:35,818
[SPEAKER_07]: He says DDR doesn't tell people to stretch either, and it's been getting away with it for so, so long, right?

1587
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:39,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it shouldn't even be a thing.

1588
01:44:39,441 --> 01:44:40,762
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a frivolous lawsuit.

1589
01:44:40,822 --> 01:44:41,683
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get thrown out.

1590
01:44:44,471 --> 01:44:44,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

1591
01:44:44,932 --> 01:44:45,413
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

1592
01:44:45,473 --> 01:44:49,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Frivolous lawsuits, I don't know about you guys, but frivolous lawsuits make me angry.

1593
01:44:49,602 --> 01:44:54,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we get angry here at Orange Lounge Radio, we cue that nasty music and say some nasty things.

1594
01:45:10,566 --> 01:45:11,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two FUs.

1595
01:45:12,487 --> 01:45:17,390
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one being the internet connection at my house because of the damn wind.

1596
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, this really isn't like wind, but unfortunately Sacramento has no idea what to do when a tree moves.

1597
01:45:26,414 --> 01:45:27,975
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair, California in general.

1598
01:45:29,336 --> 01:45:29,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1599
01:45:30,596 --> 01:45:31,337
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean...

1600
01:45:32,608 --> 01:45:34,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan for the fucking wind.

1601
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:37,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We get windstorms here every so often, so just plan for it.

1602
01:45:38,754 --> 01:45:40,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And be prepared for everything.

1603
01:45:40,656 --> 01:45:41,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Constant vigilance!

1604
01:45:43,553 --> 01:46:04,110
[SPEAKER_02]: and then my other FU goes towards Half.com for the school book that I ordered that still hasn't arrived but I will say that I don't think I got charged for it so that means I have to go find the damn thing again and I don't want to buy it from school because school is fucking expensive.

1605
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:10,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather be frugal because I have things that my money is better spent on.

1606
01:46:11,576 --> 01:46:11,916
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1607
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:15,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do you have any FUs of the week?

1608
01:46:29,808 --> 01:46:54,758
[SPEAKER_08]: and it keeps fucking raining and it always rains like on the weekend it's dry through the week and then it starts raining and then wind and ugh but so now this next week I'm hoping to be able to go airsofting it might actually have to be that Saturday instead of Sunday morning which is annoying but Actdeft in chat has a suggestion for you he says blame it on the rain yeah yeah forget it

1609
01:46:56,085 --> 01:46:56,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, that's funny.

1610
01:46:57,066 --> 01:47:01,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But right now, um, I have a feeling, though, it's going to still be raining next week.

1611
01:47:01,930 --> 01:47:02,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking weather.

1612
01:47:03,111 --> 01:47:09,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure, it doesn't rain all, you know, before this, and now all of a sudden it's just like, oh, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, more, more rain.

1613
01:47:12,389 --> 01:47:13,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well my F.U.

1614
01:47:13,729 --> 01:47:16,770
[SPEAKER_07]: of the week goes to having the worst Valentine's Day ever.

1615
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:17,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Ever.

1616
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:20,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I was sick and I was having what you call a horizontal day.

1617
01:47:20,811 --> 01:47:22,572
[SPEAKER_07]: That means I was lying on the couch all day long.

1618
01:47:22,692 --> 01:47:24,592
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I made Valentine's Day kind of suck.

1619
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:28,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was just bored and lonely and sad.

1620
01:47:29,314 --> 01:47:31,314
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I just wanted a hug.

1621
01:47:31,334 --> 01:47:32,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that so wrong?

1622
01:47:33,395 --> 01:47:34,435
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Valentine's Day sucks.

1623
01:47:34,455 --> 01:47:34,855
[SPEAKER_07]: But what is it?

1624
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:35,775
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just another day, right?

1625
01:47:36,796 --> 01:47:38,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan, do you have any F.U.s of the week real quick?

1626
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:44,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say FU to Ryu because he keeps kicking my ass and that's about it.

1627
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:46,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you have it.

1628
01:47:46,420 --> 01:47:46,840
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Ryu.

1629
01:47:47,981 --> 01:47:48,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1630
01:47:49,662 --> 01:47:52,843
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to do it for the FUs of the week but let's get back into some gaming news and guess what?

1631
01:47:52,863 --> 01:47:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: The lawsuit stories are not over.

1632
01:47:54,824 --> 01:47:55,384
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1633
01:47:56,264 --> 01:47:57,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess who got sued this time though?

1634
01:47:57,765 --> 01:47:59,025
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost a twist of fate.

1635
01:47:59,425 --> 01:48:07,769
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how there's this running inside joke that Konami will sue ever since they sued Rockstar which I still think they were in the right to sue them.

1636
01:48:07,789 --> 01:48:08,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1637
01:48:08,129 --> 01:48:08,729
[SPEAKER_02]: They were totally

1638
01:48:08,869 --> 01:48:13,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they were totally in the right, but some of the lawsuits since then have been a little interesting.

1639
01:48:13,451 --> 01:48:15,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now the tables have gotten turned.

1640
01:48:15,552 --> 01:48:17,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami got sued this week.

1641
01:48:17,592 --> 01:48:17,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1642
01:48:18,393 --> 01:48:20,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's not Konami will sue, it's Konami got sued.

1643
01:48:21,594 --> 01:48:26,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Viacom and Harmonix sued Konami over the game Rock Revolution.

1644
01:48:27,476 --> 01:48:31,998
[SPEAKER_07]: They say that Rock Revolution violates their patents for musical instrument peripherals.

1645
01:48:32,918 --> 01:48:34,159
[SPEAKER_07]: But wait a minute, um...

1646
01:48:34,946 --> 01:48:35,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1647
01:48:57,583 --> 01:49:12,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, but I guess, well, more so, they probably want cash for it, and they probably want, I don't know, some type of... I would, you know, it's sad to say, I would say that Rock Revolution impacted the sale of Rock Band in no way whatsoever.

1648
01:49:13,236 --> 01:49:14,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, for real, right?

1649
01:49:14,577 --> 01:49:20,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't honestly say there's been one person on the face of the earth that said, ooh, Rock Revolution, that's way better than Rock Band.

1650
01:49:21,943 --> 01:49:23,324
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is so strange.

1651
01:49:23,384 --> 01:49:34,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, even though the Viacom patent says that it improved on earlier video game music controllers and even kind of references Beatmania, they're still... But this is the weird thing about it.

1652
01:49:34,828 --> 01:49:38,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami didn't put out a new guitar with this game.

1653
01:49:38,269 --> 01:49:41,490
[SPEAKER_07]: They put out a new drum set, which probably sold five of them.

1654
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:46,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless the internals of the drum set are something similar to what's put out there.

1655
01:49:46,932 --> 01:49:50,274
[SPEAKER_08]: But their drum set looked like their old drum set for Drummania.

1656
01:49:50,814 --> 01:49:51,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1657
01:49:51,866 --> 01:49:52,747
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like crap.

1658
01:49:53,327 --> 01:49:54,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And it apparently played like crap.

1659
01:49:55,008 --> 01:49:56,229
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't understand.

1660
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1661
01:49:58,170 --> 01:50:01,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than maybe it's like, well, fine, you sued us, but we're going to sue you back.

1662
01:50:01,712 --> 01:50:04,293
[SPEAKER_07]: We sue you too.

1663
01:50:05,374 --> 01:50:12,738
[SPEAKER_07]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Aaron or YYR takes pride that Snake360 has outsold Rock Revolution.

1664
01:50:13,358 --> 01:50:14,519
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably a true fact.

1665
01:50:14,559 --> 01:50:15,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't doubt that at all.

1666
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:16,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't doubt it.

1667
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:18,241
[SPEAKER_02]: He does have gut mechanics.

1668
01:50:19,582 --> 01:50:22,444
[SPEAKER_07]: We got Rufus now fighting.

1669
01:50:22,544 --> 01:50:24,125
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, they're saying JustinTV's back up.

1670
01:50:24,145 --> 01:50:27,807
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to try to connect one more time on the thing, then the folks can see this.

1671
01:50:28,388 --> 01:50:35,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And at least the live listeners will get to understand what we're talking about, even if the podcast listeners are screwed.

1672
01:50:35,232 --> 01:50:36,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, still not working.

1673
01:50:36,353 --> 01:50:36,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, it's a bummer.

1674
01:50:38,464 --> 01:50:38,724
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1675
01:50:39,305 --> 01:50:42,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyhow, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this one turns out.

1676
01:50:42,568 --> 01:50:43,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if they'll settle.

1677
01:50:43,609 --> 01:50:45,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if somebody's just trying to make a point.

1678
01:50:45,611 --> 01:50:46,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

1679
01:50:46,392 --> 01:50:48,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Frisbee in our chatroom sums it up.

1680
01:50:48,434 --> 01:50:49,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Lawsuit ping pong.

1681
01:50:49,636 --> 01:50:51,598
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what appears to be happening here.

1682
01:50:51,618 --> 01:50:54,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I just – I cannot see – there's no case here.

1683
01:50:54,861 --> 01:50:55,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just –

1684
01:50:57,144 --> 01:51:00,465
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't affect their sales at all.

1685
01:51:00,525 --> 01:51:07,667
[SPEAKER_08]: The sales of Rock Revolution were so freaking poor that I don't see how they can say, oh, well, our sales were impacted.

1686
01:51:08,247 --> 01:51:11,688
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's Guitar Hero Rock Band, maybe there's something there.

1687
01:51:12,788 --> 01:51:23,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it seems like we're always siding with Konami on this show, but don't take that too much because, honestly, we're just saying that having to put your name on Rock Revolution was punishment enough.

1688
01:51:24,571 --> 01:51:25,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not good.

1689
01:51:25,692 --> 01:51:29,274
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no financial liability.

1690
01:51:29,755 --> 01:51:31,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's warranted, but what do I know?

1691
01:51:31,496 --> 01:51:32,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a judge.

1692
01:51:32,297 --> 01:51:37,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I can say maybe that they... Do they have vocals in Rock Revolution?

1693
01:51:38,001 --> 01:51:38,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they did.

1694
01:51:39,302 --> 01:51:40,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're the actual songs.

1695
01:51:40,983 --> 01:51:43,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I know you don't sing along.

1696
01:51:43,585 --> 01:51:44,865
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's all cover bands.

1697
01:51:44,885 --> 01:51:47,347
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no karaoke portion of that.

1698
01:51:48,728 --> 01:51:49,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell, I don't know.

1699
01:51:49,849 --> 01:51:50,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1700
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:51,570
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the point of the game?

1701
01:51:53,058 --> 01:51:54,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, something like that.

1702
01:51:54,659 --> 01:51:57,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's something that our World of Warcraft listeners will be more interested in.

1703
01:51:58,201 --> 01:51:58,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1704
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:01,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you actually gone back to play?

1705
01:52:02,082 --> 01:52:06,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet, but what you're about to tell us might... I'm very proud of you.

1706
01:52:06,364 --> 01:52:07,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, it's still moving.

1707
01:52:08,666 --> 01:52:12,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm very proud of you if you've resisted the urge.

1708
01:52:12,467 --> 01:52:13,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I have, it's been like three weeks now.

1709
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:16,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, tap that vein.

1710
01:52:17,311 --> 01:52:22,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's more about the dual talent stuff in case you were interested.

1711
01:52:24,435 --> 01:52:28,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the dual talent spec system is coming out in the game...

1712
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to have it to where you can switch your characters between your customization setups.

1713
01:52:37,743 --> 01:52:45,086
[SPEAKER_02]: One for raiding, one for PvP, and possibly one, you know, between, you know, one for healing and one for damaging.

1714
01:52:46,207 --> 01:52:52,610
[SPEAKER_02]: The option is only going to be available once you have hit level 80 first.

1715
01:52:55,744 --> 01:53:08,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically the reason is, according to Greg Street, who is a ghost crawler, that they didn't want to make the game more complex for lower levels who are still trying to learn their class.

1716
01:53:10,414 --> 01:53:15,298
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said if it proves popular, then they will consider expanding it.

1717
01:53:15,738 --> 01:53:23,501
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll basically pay a one-time fee to your in-game class trainer to access your dual specs.

1718
01:53:23,581 --> 01:53:29,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, you can switch between the two at any lexicon of power in any city.

1719
01:53:32,824 --> 01:53:44,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you have the inscription profession, you can sell portable lexicon of power that will require a group of players to summon and use anywhere but during combat or an arena.

1720
01:53:44,969 --> 01:53:46,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, that's going to be so nice.

1721
01:53:47,011 --> 01:53:48,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, raiding is going to change.

1722
01:53:48,592 --> 01:53:50,753
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can switch roles in the middle of a raid.

1723
01:53:50,913 --> 01:54:02,642
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, yeah, you can basically, like, if you need, like, for instance, I'm thinking Anaximus, you can get through most of the event with just two healers, but it's really nice to have a third healer for four horsemen.

1724
01:54:02,922 --> 01:54:09,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So just imagine before you engage four horsemen, okay, let's summon the Lexicon of Power and we're going to have our druid switch from Boomkin to Resto.

1725
01:54:09,527 --> 01:54:13,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's going to change the dynamics big time.

1726
01:54:14,511 --> 01:54:24,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with the specs themselves, you'll get the dual setup with your action bars and your glyphs that will just switch automatically when you change over to the other spec.

1727
01:54:26,759 --> 01:54:40,608
[SPEAKER_02]: There will also be a gear manager that will allow you to change between your equipable items, whether they be individual or entire equipment sets, between the two specs.

1728
01:54:43,047 --> 01:54:52,916
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems pretty complex, but they're actually saying that it's going to be on the public test server soon, but not immediately available.

1729
01:54:54,457 --> 01:55:03,365
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, though, that it would be starting off with possibly the next content patch, but the gear manager is not going to be at the same time.

1730
01:55:03,405 --> 01:55:04,106
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll fall later.

1731
01:55:05,066 --> 01:55:08,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it'll probably be a little while before we actually see this go into the game.

1732
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:11,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think they're doing the Uludar patch is, what, 3.1?

1733
01:55:12,153 --> 01:55:16,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's probably when we'll start seeing dual specking, but the gear thing will probably be a little while.

1734
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:18,600
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

1735
01:55:19,481 --> 01:55:27,229
[SPEAKER_07]: And the chat is making fun of me for knowing exactly all this WoW talk and all that.

1736
01:55:27,814 --> 01:55:28,234
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1737
01:55:47,938 --> 01:55:57,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Luckily, I have Street Fighter 4 to oogle over, and Dan is right now on the last boss, Seth, who looks like the glowing guy from the Watchmen trailers to me.

1738
01:55:58,641 --> 01:55:59,442
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he looks like.

1739
01:55:59,462 --> 01:56:05,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and he's a cheap bastard that has the specials from a whole bunch of different characters.

1740
01:56:07,104 --> 01:56:08,844
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not Dural.

1741
01:56:10,785 --> 01:56:11,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, TigerClaw.

1742
01:56:11,705 --> 01:56:13,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Manhattan, that's what I was trying to think of.

1743
01:56:13,285 --> 01:56:14,526
[SPEAKER_07]: He looks like Dr. Manhattan to me.

1744
01:56:15,721 --> 01:56:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Also has very abnormal muscles in a true anatomical sense.

1745
01:56:23,067 --> 01:56:24,348
[SPEAKER_07]: He ate a spinning yin-yang.

1746
01:56:24,528 --> 01:56:25,129
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

1747
01:56:25,169 --> 01:56:34,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about he has got like going down from a solar plexus in between his ribs to between his major abdominals.

1748
01:56:34,976 --> 01:56:38,159
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a whole ridge of like bonus muscles that don't exist.

1749
01:56:38,179 --> 01:56:39,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now who's talking in foreign language?

1750
01:56:41,362 --> 01:56:42,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I noticed this stuff, Rob.

1751
01:56:42,986 --> 01:56:43,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just messing.

1752
01:56:44,650 --> 01:56:47,537
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got extra muscles in his ass!

1753
01:56:49,938 --> 01:56:59,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, there's a game coming out on PC in April and possibly, well, in the PS3, I guess, in quarter three this year.

1754
01:56:59,741 --> 01:57:00,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Free Realms.

1755
01:57:00,521 --> 01:57:05,443
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a free MMORPG and it's, I guess, kind of geared towards kids.

1756
01:57:06,323 --> 01:57:11,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And you will be able to play it for free on the PlayStation Network whenever that happens to come out.

1757
01:57:12,825 --> 01:57:13,445
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of neat.

1758
01:57:14,126 --> 01:57:21,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, I guess, I don't know if it's going to be, I'm assuming it's one of those free-to-play, but you have to pay for upgrade type things.

1759
01:57:22,051 --> 01:57:23,932
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, free's good, I guess.

1760
01:57:24,493 --> 01:57:25,393
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look that bad.

1761
01:57:28,255 --> 01:57:28,716
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

1762
01:57:29,176 --> 01:57:29,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really played it.

1763
01:57:33,038 --> 01:57:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay then.

1764
01:57:35,558 --> 01:57:39,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Street Fighter IV Mania is sweeping not just the U.S., but Japan.

1765
01:57:39,839 --> 01:57:42,319
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I say mania, I mean mania.

1766
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:46,900
[SPEAKER_07]: 86,000 copies sold in the first day alone in Japan.

1767
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:50,541
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that doesn't sound like a lot of copies, you need to understand this.

1768
01:57:50,941 --> 01:57:52,401
[SPEAKER_07]: They are sold out in Japan.

1769
01:57:52,561 --> 01:57:54,901
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't find this game in Japan right now.

1770
01:57:55,261 --> 01:57:57,542
[SPEAKER_07]: 86,000 was the first pressing, and it's gone.

1771
01:57:58,182 --> 01:58:01,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they are going to try and crank some more of these guys out as fast as they can.

1772
01:58:01,382 --> 01:58:03,903
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now, they're like Nintendo Wii's.

1773
01:58:05,043 --> 01:58:06,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to find these guys.

1774
01:58:06,544 --> 01:58:06,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Not easy.

1775
01:58:07,244 --> 01:58:09,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if the same thing is going to happen over here in the U.S.

1776
01:58:09,285 --> 01:58:15,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think fighting games are as big here, but I definitely think this is the type of thing that you're probably going to be hoping you had a pre-order for.

1777
01:58:15,347 --> 01:58:18,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you're going to have to run to Best Buy when they open or the stores that don't do.

1778
01:58:18,569 --> 01:58:20,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, even Best Buy does pre-orders now, huh?

1779
01:58:20,589 --> 01:58:21,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't do pre-orders?

1780
01:58:22,529 --> 01:58:23,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Circuit City.

1781
01:58:23,149 --> 01:58:23,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, look what happened to them.

1782
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:26,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Kmart doesn't do pre-orders, so you'll have to run to Kmart at noon.

1783
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:27,530
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1784
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:33,052
[SPEAKER_07]: If you ever want to get a game on launch day, go to Kmart, because no one shops at Kmart, if you remember the old Orange Launch Radio piece of advice.

1785
01:58:33,552 --> 01:58:36,013
[SPEAKER_02]: No one shops at Kmart.

1786
01:58:36,173 --> 01:58:37,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I shop at Kmart now.

1787
01:58:38,393 --> 01:58:38,893
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why?

1788
01:58:39,274 --> 01:58:44,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the Target right over here by the house is closed for remodeling until October.

1789
01:58:44,595 --> 01:58:47,236
[SPEAKER_07]: They're turning it into an Uber Target or whatever.

1790
01:58:47,556 --> 01:58:48,076
[SPEAKER_10]: A Great Land?

1791
01:58:48,096 --> 01:58:48,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1792
01:58:48,596 --> 01:58:49,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it's turning into a great land.

1793
01:58:50,178 --> 01:58:53,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Target is closed for the foreseeable future.

1794
01:58:54,362 --> 01:58:56,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will not go to Walmart.

1795
01:58:58,065 --> 01:58:58,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1796
01:58:58,325 --> 01:59:00,107
[SPEAKER_07]: The other Target great land is kind of a ways away.

1797
01:59:00,147 --> 01:59:01,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Why won't you go to Walmart?

1798
01:59:01,328 --> 01:59:03,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's dirty and it's ghetto.

1799
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:04,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been to the one over here?

1800
01:59:04,571 --> 01:59:05,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ghetto.

1801
01:59:05,212 --> 01:59:06,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Rancho Cambodia of Walmart.

1802
01:59:06,553 --> 01:59:08,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it makes you hate humanity.

1803
01:59:08,395 --> 01:59:08,915
[SPEAKER_07]: For real.

1804
01:59:09,576 --> 01:59:11,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would rather go to Kmart, honestly.

1805
01:59:12,619 --> 01:59:12,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1806
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:14,240
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1807
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:15,781
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that for some reversal?

1808
01:59:15,961 --> 01:59:18,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Misty says, hey, I shopped at Kmart right after Christmas.

1809
01:59:18,242 --> 01:59:19,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Got some cute jeans.

1810
01:59:19,542 --> 01:59:20,023
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1811
01:59:20,603 --> 01:59:21,843
[SPEAKER_02]: They came from the 80s?

1812
01:59:23,844 --> 01:59:26,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the jeans bedazzled in the back?

1813
01:59:27,186 --> 01:59:28,886
[SPEAKER_07]: That type of 80s style?

1814
01:59:30,927 --> 01:59:32,328
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're stonewashed, Rob.

1815
01:59:32,348 --> 01:59:34,329
[SPEAKER_02]: They're acid washed.

1816
01:59:36,229 --> 01:59:36,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1817
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:38,150
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1818
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we move on?

1819
01:59:39,531 --> 01:59:40,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

1820
01:59:41,747 --> 01:59:42,227
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1821
02:00:04,685 --> 02:00:07,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about some Star Trek Online?

1822
02:00:07,066 --> 02:00:07,566
[SPEAKER_07]: How about it?

1823
02:00:07,846 --> 02:00:21,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, oh my god, we were talking about the character trailer last week, and it's pretty, and I am making the OLRians, the official alien race of Orange Sounds Radio, and yes, they are orange.

1824
02:00:21,991 --> 02:00:22,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe.

1825
02:00:24,932 --> 02:00:36,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're actually saying that there will not be any famous Star Trek personas available in Star Trek Online.

1826
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:49,103
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically saying it's in the future where the majority of the known characters have passed on, except for the ones that are robots, holograms, ghosts, etc, etc.

1827
02:00:49,243 --> 02:00:50,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Spock.

1828
02:00:50,884 --> 02:00:52,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could see data.

1829
02:00:53,145 --> 02:00:53,665
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he died.

1830
02:00:54,225 --> 02:00:55,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right!

1831
02:00:57,686 --> 02:00:57,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it!

1832
02:00:58,687 --> 02:01:01,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Lore... I don't remember.

1833
02:01:02,348 --> 02:01:03,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Trackies, help me out.

1834
02:01:04,469 --> 02:01:05,249
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened to Lore?

1835
02:01:05,349 --> 02:01:06,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he got disassembled.

1836
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1837
02:01:08,154 --> 02:01:09,254
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always more of them.

1838
02:01:11,015 --> 02:01:14,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Q. I want there to be a freaking Q mission.

1839
02:01:16,376 --> 02:01:17,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a Q mission.

1840
02:01:17,996 --> 02:01:19,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1841
02:01:22,637 --> 02:01:30,539
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they have actually been talking to some other folks and...

1842
02:01:32,844 --> 02:01:35,867
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really... I don't think they've ruled it out.

1843
02:01:35,947 --> 02:01:40,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Cryptic hasn't ruled it out, but it's not likely.

1844
02:01:40,931 --> 02:01:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, who knows what might happen with those transporter accidents.

1845
02:01:47,636 --> 02:01:49,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Dan's bringing out the big guns.

1846
02:01:49,037 --> 02:01:49,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

1847
02:01:50,475 --> 02:01:54,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan is still trying to fight the last boss of the game and is having problems.

1848
02:01:54,237 --> 02:01:55,758
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a cheap bitch.

1849
02:01:55,878 --> 02:01:58,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It's massive jaw.

1850
02:02:00,641 --> 02:02:03,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Seth suck you in his stomach and then shoot you out?

1851
02:02:03,763 --> 02:02:05,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what it looked like in that one part.

1852
02:02:06,424 --> 02:02:07,264
[SPEAKER_07]: That's disgusting.

1853
02:02:07,765 --> 02:02:13,708
[SPEAKER_02]: It's massive jaw versus person who's been taking too much colloidal silver.

1854
02:02:14,388 --> 02:02:15,589
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that turns you blue for real.

1855
02:02:15,749 --> 02:02:16,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1856
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true.

1857
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:18,631
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a chemistry nerd.

1858
02:02:19,028 --> 02:02:19,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not.

1859
02:02:19,929 --> 02:02:23,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I just happen to know that because I have an odd interest in skin diseases.

1860
02:02:24,072 --> 02:02:27,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we're going to get to the mailbag here soon, but a couple more stories for you first.

1861
02:02:27,794 --> 02:02:28,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?

1862
02:02:28,314 --> 02:02:30,616
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new artist coming to Rock Band.

1863
02:02:31,156 --> 02:02:32,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it someone good?

1864
02:02:32,918 --> 02:02:33,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Miley Cyrus?

1865
02:02:33,938 --> 02:02:35,399
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not Miley Cyrus.

1866
02:02:35,419 --> 02:02:36,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Danny Minogue?

1867
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:37,760
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not Danny Manilow.

1868
02:02:38,360 --> 02:02:39,961
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Snoop Dogg.

1869
02:02:40,841 --> 02:02:44,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Just when I think of rock band, I think of Snoop Dogg.

1870
02:02:44,182 --> 02:02:45,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Snoop Dogg.

1871
02:02:45,442 --> 02:02:48,383
[SPEAKER_08]: He is coming to rock band as download content.

1872
02:02:51,003 --> 02:02:57,805
[SPEAKER_08]: No word on which songs they're actually going to put in rock band, but I don't know many of them that are rock-ish, you know?

1873
02:02:58,705 --> 02:02:59,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1874
02:02:59,365 --> 02:02:59,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

1875
02:03:00,005 --> 02:03:01,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just play Gin and Juice.

1876
02:03:01,246 --> 02:03:02,026
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll still be fun.

1877
02:03:04,207 --> 02:03:05,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says faux shizzle.

1878
02:03:05,548 --> 02:03:07,049
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go riding with the homies?

1879
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:08,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't that Coolio?

1880
02:03:09,331 --> 02:03:09,991
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was Coolio.

1881
02:03:10,031 --> 02:03:10,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1882
02:03:10,371 --> 02:03:11,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Coolio was rolling with the homies.

1883
02:03:11,812 --> 02:03:13,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Coolio was Coolio-er.

1884
02:03:15,195 --> 02:03:15,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1885
02:03:16,836 --> 02:03:19,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Please tell me there's some other bands that make more sense for a rock band.

1886
02:03:19,858 --> 02:03:22,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's some other stuff coming too.

1887
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:25,922
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, White Zombie, which makes me happy.

1888
02:03:25,982 --> 02:03:29,184
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two songs from White Zombie, Black Sunshine and More Human Than Humans.

1889
02:03:29,730 --> 02:03:30,971
[SPEAKER_08]: More human than human

1890
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:06,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Some actual Puff Daddy song, I think, that they did a rock version of.

1891
02:04:06,122 --> 02:04:10,044
[SPEAKER_08]: That would fit for rock band, although I think it's kind of old.

1892
02:04:10,564 --> 02:04:12,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember seeing this back when I was playing Cusar.

1893
02:04:12,985 --> 02:04:15,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That's years ago.

1894
02:04:16,346 --> 02:04:18,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what song I'm surprised they haven't put in there?

1895
02:04:19,127 --> 02:04:21,308
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Public Enemy Anthrax, Bring the Noise.

1896
02:04:22,589 --> 02:04:23,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that?

1897
02:04:25,157 --> 02:04:30,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I was going to suggest the Run DMC and Aerosmith, but that was actually in the Aerosmith Guitar Hero, wasn't it?

1898
02:04:31,121 --> 02:04:35,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in Guitar Hero Aerosmith, but we need actual rocking out.

1899
02:04:35,304 --> 02:04:36,145
[SPEAKER_02]: We need Anthrax.

1900
02:04:38,327 --> 02:04:39,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthrax and Public Enemy.

1901
02:04:39,347 --> 02:04:41,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I still say we need GWAR, but that's just me.

1902
02:04:42,229 --> 02:04:43,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we need GWAR.

1903
02:04:43,510 --> 02:04:44,391
[SPEAKER_02]: GWAR!

1904
02:04:44,411 --> 02:04:46,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we need rock band GWAR.

1905
02:04:47,751 --> 02:04:48,472
[SPEAKER_08]: or Rob Zombie.

1906
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:50,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be good with Rob Zombie even though, you know, white zombies.

1907
02:04:50,955 --> 02:04:52,818
[SPEAKER_07]: They have some Rob Zombie but not Dragula.

1908
02:04:53,178 --> 02:04:54,260
[SPEAKER_07]: More Rob Zombie there.

1909
02:04:55,021 --> 02:04:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1910
02:04:56,202 --> 02:04:58,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's do some more news and we'll get to mailbag.

1911
02:04:58,566 --> 02:05:00,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one more story here and it's about G.I.

1912
02:05:00,688 --> 02:05:02,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe and of course...

1913
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:02,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1914
02:05:02,831 --> 02:05:03,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1915
02:05:03,111 --> 02:05:03,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1916
02:05:25,326 --> 02:05:27,347
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do well as you play the G.I.

1917
02:05:27,387 --> 02:05:32,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe game, you will unlock vintage educational clips where G.I.

1918
02:05:32,409 --> 02:05:37,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Joe comes out and does this little spiel and says, and now you know, and knowing is half the battle.

1919
02:05:38,391 --> 02:05:39,832
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty amazing.

1920
02:05:40,996 --> 02:05:42,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So, awesome.

1921
02:05:42,737 --> 02:05:48,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you have a reason to get this if you don't have them all on Betamax tape or something like that.

1922
02:05:48,081 --> 02:05:48,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1923
02:05:49,623 --> 02:05:50,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Betamax.

1924
02:05:51,084 --> 02:05:54,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, let's take a minute to open up ye olde mailbag and see what you guys have to say.

1925
02:05:55,007 --> 02:05:57,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.

1926
02:05:58,529 --> 02:06:01,231
[SPEAKER_07]: We rip open the email bag and see what you guys have to say.

1927
02:06:02,953 --> 02:06:03,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1928
02:06:03,593 --> 02:06:04,013
[SPEAKER_02]: No mail.

1929
02:06:04,614 --> 02:06:05,254
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lie.

1930
02:06:05,294 --> 02:06:06,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw at least three in there earlier.

1931
02:06:06,736 --> 02:06:07,676
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three.

1932
02:06:07,916 --> 02:06:08,477
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1933
02:06:09,697 --> 02:06:11,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Sup, lords of OLR?

1934
02:06:12,501 --> 02:06:19,449
[SPEAKER_02]: As you maybe know, I listen and wrote this misg to the podcast on my iTouch.

1935
02:06:20,591 --> 02:06:25,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Last Sunday, I wept because I tried to listen live on allgames.com, but it didn't work.

1936
02:06:25,537 --> 02:06:26,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Frowny face!

1937
02:06:27,399 --> 02:06:31,682
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you guys broadcast live to iTouch and hell, even PSP listeners?

1938
02:06:32,223 --> 02:06:38,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I told you I got Endwar last week and beat it in five hours and lied to Blockbuster about it being broken.

1939
02:06:39,048 --> 02:06:40,729
[SPEAKER_02]: LOL, I'm just cheap like that.

1940
02:06:41,570 --> 02:06:48,615
[SPEAKER_02]: The game was basically Company of Heroes on the PC with mic support, which was state-of-the-art and worked.

1941
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:51,938
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother just picked up four cake-ass games today.

1942
02:06:52,398 --> 02:06:53,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Random capitalization.

1943
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:56,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And this weekend is gonna kick ass too.

1944
02:06:57,448 --> 02:07:02,181
[SPEAKER_02]: The games were Gears of War 2, GTA 4, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, and Lost Planet.

1945
02:07:03,396 --> 02:07:05,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an ass ton of games to play.

1946
02:07:05,938 --> 02:07:08,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what I thought of them next time.

1947
02:07:08,461 --> 02:07:10,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Until the next email you hear from me, goodbye.

1948
02:07:11,623 --> 02:07:13,385
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from RJ.

1949
02:07:13,405 --> 02:07:27,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to say this, given how much texting I do on my iPhone, it is possible to capitalize and use proper grammar and spell shit correctly.

1950
02:07:27,498 --> 02:07:29,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when it fixes it for you!

1951
02:07:31,184 --> 02:07:44,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, really the only way to really listen to the podcast through your iPod or iPhone is going to be to download the podcast.

1952
02:07:45,367 --> 02:07:46,887
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have it available live.

1953
02:07:47,928 --> 02:07:51,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PSP is the... I thought we had a live player on PSP.

1954
02:07:52,909 --> 02:07:53,289
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.

1955
02:07:53,329 --> 02:07:55,149
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be on the PSP to see it, though.

1956
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:56,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1957
02:07:57,950 --> 02:07:58,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to.

1958
02:08:00,515 --> 02:08:01,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1959
02:08:05,497 --> 02:08:09,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Read me here with greetings to the three hosts and ferret.

1960
02:08:09,259 --> 02:08:11,020
[SPEAKER_02]: The ferret says hello as well.

1961
02:08:13,516 --> 02:08:16,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to take this particular email to hype a game.

1962
02:08:16,978 --> 02:08:20,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily about the gameplay itself, but more the experience.

1963
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:23,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I initially meant this towards Sky and DarkSakura.

1964
02:08:23,561 --> 02:08:27,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki may not get it, but he may be mildly amused.

1965
02:08:27,563 --> 02:08:29,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought, oh well, let's get your listeners in this.

1966
02:08:30,525 --> 02:08:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I say the name of the game, I'd like to ask for any chatroom listeners who have played it to not spoil anything about the game.

1967
02:08:37,929 --> 02:08:39,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that was in caps, so I screamed it.

1968
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:40,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1969
02:08:41,291 --> 02:08:43,272
[SPEAKER_02]: The name of the game is Aversion.

1970
02:08:44,193 --> 02:08:47,615
[SPEAKER_02]: To compel everyone to play this simple game, here are a few reasons.

1971
02:08:48,215 --> 02:08:51,297
[SPEAKER_02]: It's free and played on your PC with low system requirements.

1972
02:08:51,417 --> 02:08:52,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two hours.

1973
02:08:52,658 --> 02:08:54,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a platformer, but it's not very hard.

1974
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:57,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, it's cute with a secret.

1975
02:08:58,682 --> 02:08:59,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Navy Seals.

1976
02:09:00,843 --> 02:09:05,667
[SPEAKER_02]: and again, it's meant to be an experience and worth it for the true ending.

1977
02:09:05,687 --> 02:09:06,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there are two endings.

1978
02:09:07,689 --> 02:09:08,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the link for everyone.

1979
02:09:09,650 --> 02:09:19,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's zarat.us z-a-r-a-t dot u-s slash t-r-a slash offline dash games slash eversion e-v-r-s-i-o-n dot h-t-m-l Hold on.

1980
02:09:26,084 --> 02:09:26,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1981
02:09:27,365 --> 02:09:28,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dying here and

1982
02:09:30,816 --> 02:09:31,656
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing other things.

1983
02:09:33,837 --> 02:09:34,758
[SPEAKER_08]: He's working on Justin TV.

1984
02:09:34,778 --> 02:09:37,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it says it's working, but it's not working.

1985
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the phantom working.

1986
02:09:43,902 --> 02:09:45,263
[SPEAKER_08]: See, Seth is a cheap bastard.

1987
02:09:45,303 --> 02:09:46,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just, you know...

1988
02:09:57,984 --> 02:10:00,726
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's why you have to switch it to one round per battle.

1989
02:10:12,975 --> 02:10:18,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra credit to Sky if he'll make a video of himself playing the game blind, never playing it before, not literally blind.

1990
02:10:19,262 --> 02:10:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to poke his eyes out.

1991
02:10:21,464 --> 02:10:25,508
[SPEAKER_02]: With audio commentary and uploading it to the neglected OLR YouTube channel.

1992
02:10:25,668 --> 02:10:26,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1993
02:10:27,450 --> 02:10:31,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's not worth it if someone doesn't elicit the proper reaction.

1994
02:10:32,853 --> 02:10:42,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And a random question, will OLR support the DSI with podcast in AAC format for those too lazy to convert them from MP3?

1995
02:10:43,196 --> 02:10:44,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you the generic answer, maybe.

1996
02:10:46,297 --> 02:10:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your response.

1997
02:10:47,617 --> 02:10:48,737
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome for your response.

1998
02:10:48,997 --> 02:10:51,898
[SPEAKER_02]: This email brought to you by The Mirror Room from Silent Hill 3.

1999
02:10:53,379 --> 02:10:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: With a weird scrunchy face.

2000
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:58,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email!

2001
02:11:00,180 --> 02:11:01,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike in Australia again.

2002
02:11:03,187 --> 02:11:09,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say thank you to Rob and all in chat a fortnight ago that recommended Chrono Trigger.

2003
02:11:10,394 --> 02:11:17,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's not a game I generally would play, I got the game on Rob's and the OL Army's recommendation and have been really enjoying it.

2004
02:11:17,701 --> 02:11:21,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Might have to try Super Metroid if Rob picked it as the number one game above Chrono Trigger.

2005
02:11:27,552 --> 02:11:33,936
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any other DS games you can recommend, regardless of type of game, I would like to hear your suggestions.

2006
02:11:34,256 --> 02:11:38,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope everyone in the OLR world is doing well and look forward to getting the podcast updated soon.

2007
02:11:39,339 --> 02:11:39,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

2008
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:48,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Well, I know I've said this, but Castlevania Order of Ecclesia is a lot of fun.

2009
02:11:49,925 --> 02:11:51,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I do really like Cooking Mama.

2010
02:11:52,366 --> 02:11:53,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Um...

2011
02:11:55,658 --> 02:11:59,584
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, of course, the Western release, Elite Beat Agents.

2012
02:11:59,624 --> 02:12:05,111
[SPEAKER_02]: You can maybe find Osatatakai Oendan or Oendan 2 from Japan.

2013
02:12:07,964 --> 02:12:10,365
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of good RPGs out there.

2014
02:12:10,385 --> 02:12:12,907
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a bunch of really good games out there.

2015
02:12:15,348 --> 02:12:20,812
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do totally recommend Order of Ecclesia.

2016
02:12:20,852 --> 02:12:31,658
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to know what I'm playing, I'm grabbing my DS case right now while Rob is fixing Justin TV and I'll let you know what the hell's in it right now.

2017
02:12:32,599 --> 02:12:35,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me grab this monstrosity of a case.

2018
02:12:36,241 --> 02:12:36,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.

2019
02:12:38,407 --> 02:12:55,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, of course, half of them fell down Sorry, if you hear the random noises, I'm trying to fix JustinTV I'm not having much luck, though I think I just lost a game in your couch, Rob I think us trying to upgrade the encoder thing Dan finally did it Broke JustinTV, so I don't know With Dan!

2020
02:12:55,821 --> 02:12:57,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan beat Seth with Dan!

2021
02:12:59,193 --> 02:12:59,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2022
02:12:59,633 --> 02:13:07,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, right as Dan beats the game with Dan, I can't get stupid Justin TV to work.

2023
02:13:07,895 --> 02:13:08,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pissed.

2024
02:13:08,935 --> 02:13:11,395
[SPEAKER_04]: If I ever meet someone named Seth, I'm just going to punch him in the face.

2025
02:13:13,256 --> 02:13:14,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I know why.

2026
02:13:15,576 --> 02:13:23,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, the games that are currently in my case at this point in time, and maybe this will give you an idea.

2027
02:13:24,318 --> 02:13:24,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2028
02:13:25,084 --> 02:13:28,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Dan's got a fun ending with Blanca, a.k.a.

2029
02:13:28,766 --> 02:13:30,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy, and Sakura, and Ryu.

2030
02:13:32,967 --> 02:13:33,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, spoilers.

2031
02:13:35,108 --> 02:13:35,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say anything else.

2032
02:13:36,709 --> 02:13:47,613
[SPEAKER_02]: So the games in my case right now are Final Fantasy VI for Advance, Polarium, Trauma Center, Ragnarok DS is currently in my DS.

2033
02:13:48,733 --> 02:14:10,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, Cooking Mama 1 and 2, Puyo Puyo Fever, or sorry, Puyo Pop Fever, Animal Crossing Wild World, Osutatakai Oendan, and Doctor Who Top Trumps from the UK, which given that you're in Australia, I'm sure that you won't have a problem getting that.

2034
02:14:10,801 --> 02:14:14,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's currently in my system right now.

2035
02:14:15,502 --> 02:14:17,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that'll give you some ideas.

2036
02:14:19,822 --> 02:14:20,743
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I want to go back.

2037
02:14:20,783 --> 02:14:27,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Since I was futzing with JustinTV, I wanted to kind of correct one thing one listener was saying, and that was about being able to listen to Orange Launch Radio on your iPhone.

2038
02:14:27,830 --> 02:14:28,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here's the other game.

2039
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:30,432
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually can listen live.

2040
02:14:30,552 --> 02:14:32,033
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to use an app like Tuner.

2041
02:14:32,634 --> 02:14:33,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuner's what I use.

2042
02:14:33,395 --> 02:14:39,821
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pay app, but I know there's a free one as well out there that you can use to tune in to All Games Radio when we're live on Sunday night.

2043
02:14:39,861 --> 02:14:42,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can listen on the phone, iPhone, just like you can on the PSP.

2044
02:14:43,044 --> 02:14:44,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to correct that.

2045
02:14:45,135 --> 02:14:47,838
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game that's in here, the one that I lost to your couch?

2046
02:14:47,878 --> 02:14:48,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2047
02:14:48,298 --> 02:14:49,339
[SPEAKER_02]: The world ends with you.

2048
02:14:49,580 --> 02:14:52,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you don't want to lose... I mean, you do want to lose that one to my couch.

2049
02:14:52,342 --> 02:14:52,743
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't, Rob.

2050
02:14:52,783 --> 02:14:53,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to play.

2051
02:14:54,424 --> 02:14:54,785
Woo-hoo.

2052
02:14:57,395 --> 02:15:02,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anywho, I'm just looking at the new website, the OL Army Picks, and I finally see the Asakura vs. Dan.

2053
02:15:02,919 --> 02:15:04,060
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the greatest quality, though.

2054
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:07,763
[SPEAKER_07]: If Justin TV stays down, we'll try to make a YouTube after the show.

2055
02:15:09,704 --> 02:15:11,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a 10-minute review of Street Fighter 4.

2056
02:15:11,546 --> 02:15:12,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that could be a fun thing we can do.

2057
02:15:13,247 --> 02:15:13,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2058
02:15:13,908 --> 02:15:15,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki's trying to work like mad to get Justin TV back up.

2059
02:15:15,909 --> 02:15:16,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what happens.

2060
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:21,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, meanwhile, if that does it for the mailbag, I'm going to say, send us more mail.

2061
02:15:21,794 --> 02:15:23,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2062
02:15:23,775 --> 02:15:28,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if I'm not over this by next week, someone else is reading Mailbag.

2063
02:15:29,437 --> 02:15:29,757
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2064
02:15:29,957 --> 02:15:32,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I can always do that, I guess, if my cold goes away.

2065
02:15:32,718 --> 02:15:39,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, we've got a couple more news stories and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2066
02:15:39,141 --> 02:15:40,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just yet, almost there.

2067
02:15:40,761 --> 02:15:41,922
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple more news stories for you guys.

2068
02:15:43,407 --> 02:15:44,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2069
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:08,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Spyro and Crash

2070
02:16:32,124 --> 02:16:49,141
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff that they can make multiple releases for well EA picked it up and now Activision wants money so I don't get how that's possible but okay and it's actually funny because EA had put out a comment too about it as well um

2071
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:52,318
[SPEAKER_08]: regarding the whole Brutal Legend thing.

2072
02:16:52,739 --> 02:16:58,640
[SPEAKER_08]: They attributed it to, it's like, you know, we doubt Activision would try to sue.

2073
02:16:59,060 --> 02:17:04,081
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be like a husband abandoning his family and then suing after his wife meets a better-looking guy.

2074
02:17:05,241 --> 02:17:07,222
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the most awesome comparison I've ever heard.

2075
02:17:07,282 --> 02:17:09,542
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, it makes, you know, what they're saying makes sense.

2076
02:17:09,562 --> 02:17:15,664
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like, well, you guys didn't want to put out this game, so we're giving him an outlet, and now you're saying, no, you can't do it.

2077
02:17:16,024 --> 02:17:16,964
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

2078
02:17:17,664 --> 02:17:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2079
02:17:19,286 --> 02:17:19,827
[SPEAKER_07]: They want money.

2080
02:17:20,347 --> 02:17:22,309
[SPEAKER_07]: They do, but then why won't they just put out the game?

2081
02:17:23,369 --> 02:17:24,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're afraid of someone else making money.

2082
02:17:25,551 --> 02:17:26,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's weird.

2083
02:17:26,331 --> 02:17:27,012
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing's weird.

2084
02:17:27,372 --> 02:17:32,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, basically saying that they were still in talks with them about putting out the game.

2085
02:17:32,516 --> 02:17:33,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, too bad.

2086
02:17:33,617 --> 02:17:39,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that one of the things that's like, oh, well, shit, if it's going to be such a big deal, maybe we should put out this game after all.

2087
02:17:39,761 --> 02:17:40,282
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, well...

2088
02:17:40,990 --> 02:17:41,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

2089
02:17:41,671 --> 02:17:48,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, oh, well, we were in talks, you know, but that's like saying, you know, I was about to buy a car and some guy, you know, I've been dicking around.

2090
02:17:48,457 --> 02:17:50,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm looking around at some other things.

2091
02:17:50,419 --> 02:17:51,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I may buy that car.

2092
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:52,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you know.

2093
02:17:52,481 --> 02:17:54,243
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some guy comes in and buys the car.

2094
02:17:54,623 --> 02:17:56,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to go sue the guy because he bought my car.

2095
02:17:57,606 --> 02:18:04,072
[SPEAKER_08]: If you dick around for it, you know, and you didn't think that you thought that Spyro would do a lot better than this, which.

2096
02:18:04,893 --> 02:18:15,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you right now when they made that announcement originally, I was like, are you fucking kidding me that they're going to drop Ghostbusters and Brutal Legend because they want Spyro and Crash?

2097
02:18:16,086 --> 02:18:16,406
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2098
02:18:17,567 --> 02:18:19,670
[SPEAKER_08]: So in other words, stop dicking around, Activision.

2099
02:18:19,710 --> 02:18:20,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop being retarded!

2100
02:18:22,461 --> 02:18:23,743
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2101
02:18:37,858 --> 02:18:39,938
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, our old buddy Bobby wants to make a point here.

2102
02:18:39,999 --> 02:18:46,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Activision doesn't want to publish it, but they want the money for it like they got from Atari for Ghostbusters and Riddick.

2103
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:49,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Atari paid Activision for the rights to publish the game.

2104
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:52,541
[SPEAKER_07]: EA is not paying Activision to publish Brutal Legend.

2105
02:18:54,041 --> 02:18:55,502
[SPEAKER_07]: EA is not that beat down yet.

2106
02:18:57,482 --> 02:18:59,142
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be interesting to see what comes of this.

2107
02:18:59,862 --> 02:19:00,242
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2108
02:19:01,043 --> 02:19:02,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, the person that's going to get hurt here

2109
02:19:04,141 --> 02:19:07,682
[SPEAKER_07]: The folks behind Brutal Legend, including the same gentleman who was responsible for Psychonauts.

2110
02:19:09,343 --> 02:19:09,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Bummer.

2111
02:19:10,003 --> 02:19:10,843
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll get published.

2112
02:19:11,243 --> 02:19:11,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually.

2113
02:19:12,063 --> 02:19:13,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It was never going to be a big hit.

2114
02:19:13,704 --> 02:19:14,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to tell you this.

2115
02:19:14,904 --> 02:19:17,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nichey title.

2116
02:19:17,125 --> 02:19:19,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to sell a gajillion copies.

2117
02:19:19,525 --> 02:19:21,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why Activision passed on it.

2118
02:19:23,087 --> 02:19:26,548
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, the thing is, you've got to go with the...

2119
02:19:28,646 --> 02:19:33,308
[SPEAKER_04]: The safe titles, and then you gotta go with the titles that are gonna get you some acclaim.

2120
02:19:34,308 --> 02:19:44,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, EA is kind of learning that, because they went from doing all the safe bets, all the time, and everybody was like, fuck EA, their games are horrible.

2121
02:19:45,132 --> 02:19:48,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what else can they spew out of us besides EA Sports and crap?

2122
02:19:49,173 --> 02:19:55,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they started bringing out all these great games, like Dead Space, and Mirror's Edge, and...

2123
02:19:56,434 --> 02:20:06,424
[SPEAKER_04]: These games that have kind of more limited audiences, but they're getting EA some recognition as, hey, I remember when EA could make a game.

2124
02:20:06,744 --> 02:20:09,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I freaking sold a copy of Mirror's Edge last week, practically.

2125
02:20:10,568 --> 02:20:11,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember Matt was here last week.

2126
02:20:11,869 --> 02:20:15,512
[SPEAKER_07]: We played the demo after the show, and he totally was like, oh, I got to get this game.

2127
02:20:15,532 --> 02:20:16,173
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.

2128
02:20:16,533 --> 02:20:17,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I sold a copy of Mirror's Edge.

2129
02:20:17,975 --> 02:20:19,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my sales money?

2130
02:20:19,316 --> 02:20:20,617
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fantastic game.

2131
02:20:20,837 --> 02:20:21,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2132
02:20:21,838 --> 02:20:24,519
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're gonna build new franchises.

2133
02:20:24,579 --> 02:20:36,482
[SPEAKER_04]: And Activision sold their future franchises for old, tired franchises that aren't with the developers that made them famous anymore and are pieces of crap.

2134
02:20:36,942 --> 02:20:38,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Crash is done.

2135
02:20:39,203 --> 02:20:43,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, every Crash game is gonna sell 250,000 copies.

2136
02:20:43,704 --> 02:20:44,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's consistent.

2137
02:20:44,984 --> 02:20:46,425
[SPEAKER_04]: The kids know the brand.

2138
02:20:46,545 --> 02:20:48,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I sold a Crash game the other day.

2139
02:20:48,465 --> 02:20:49,286
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurt my heart.

2140
02:20:49,426 --> 02:20:50,066
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know...

2141
02:20:50,745 --> 02:20:51,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Crash of the Titans.

2142
02:20:52,306 --> 02:20:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's family entertainment.

2143
02:20:54,268 --> 02:20:59,551
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but you look at like this Ghostbusters game, which has had screenshots out for like, what, a year?

2144
02:21:00,012 --> 02:21:02,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I have demo discs saying that I could get it last October.

2145
02:21:03,134 --> 02:21:04,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked great then.

2146
02:21:05,776 --> 02:21:09,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And Atari, I think, is going to have a hit on their hands that they need.

2147
02:21:09,699 --> 02:21:15,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe they can break out of that, you know, yeah, we make Dragon Ball Z and it keeps us in business.

2148
02:21:15,983 --> 02:21:17,965
[SPEAKER_04]: We're up that they've been in for the last few years.

2149
02:21:19,935 --> 02:21:21,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, BlackWolf brings up a good point.

2150
02:21:21,436 --> 02:21:23,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It still has the Ghostbusters lanyards from PAX.

2151
02:21:24,217 --> 02:21:26,778
[SPEAKER_07]: All of us that went to Penny Arcade Expo, our lanyards were Ghostbusters.

2152
02:21:27,038 --> 02:21:30,100
[SPEAKER_07]: That was like the day before they pulled the plug on it.

2153
02:21:30,660 --> 02:21:36,463
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and really, Activision, just for whatever reason, they sent out the nicest little Ghostbusters pre-sale kit.

2154
02:21:36,823 --> 02:21:39,844
[SPEAKER_04]: It came with an Ecto-1 license plate that I shanked.

2155
02:21:40,225 --> 02:21:44,306
[SPEAKER_04]: It came with Ghostbusters lanyards, a demo disc, a t-shirt.

2156
02:21:44,687 --> 02:21:47,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was a nice little kit, and the box looked like a trap.

2157
02:21:48,689 --> 02:21:52,491
[SPEAKER_04]: and it had like goo oozing out and it says do not open until October 2008.

2158
02:21:53,171 --> 02:21:54,812
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty sick.

2159
02:21:54,892 --> 02:21:55,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got to wonder.

2160
02:21:55,853 --> 02:22:00,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like why put all that energy into it and then just be like, oh yeah, we got Blizzard on our side now.

2161
02:22:01,136 --> 02:22:01,976
[SPEAKER_04]: F this game.

2162
02:22:02,537 --> 02:22:07,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Activision published Ghostbusters back in the day for the NES and the Sega and the Commodore.

2163
02:22:07,659 --> 02:22:10,721
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you figured it would be, you know, poetic that they're going to carry it on.

2164
02:22:11,702 --> 02:22:12,662
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not so much.

2165
02:22:13,282 --> 02:22:13,883
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to let it go.

2166
02:22:14,562 --> 02:22:15,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just let it go.

2167
02:22:15,763 --> 02:22:16,623
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of weird.

2168
02:22:18,524 --> 02:22:24,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be just like Psychonauts where it'll be that game nobody buys when it comes out except for the enlightened few.

2169
02:22:24,688 --> 02:22:34,973
[SPEAKER_04]: The unwashed masses don't understand it, won't get it, and then it'll be expensive on the secondary market if somebody who wants to be newly hardcore figures out that it's out there and has to get their hands on it.

2170
02:22:36,594 --> 02:22:36,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.

2171
02:22:40,236 --> 02:22:41,917
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be one of those titles.

2172
02:22:43,698 --> 02:22:44,078
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2173
02:22:44,744 --> 02:22:46,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we got one more news story for you guys.

2174
02:22:46,405 --> 02:22:51,828
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up the Skype line, take some quick calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2175
02:22:51,849 --> 02:22:54,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's about the Beatles game that's coming out later this year.

2176
02:22:56,451 --> 02:22:57,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not rock band Beatles.

2177
02:22:57,872 --> 02:23:00,714
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the Beatles that will probably look a lot like rock band.

2178
02:23:01,054 --> 02:23:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, finally, we have some insight as to what this game might be like, and it's from an interview with Entertainment Weekly.

2179
02:23:05,637 --> 02:23:13,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Paul McCartney actually has talked about the Beatles music game, saying 45 Beatles songs will be in this game from different periods of the Beatles' histories.

2180
02:23:14,023 --> 02:23:18,771
[SPEAKER_07]: including early days tracks, Liverpool, Psychedelic, and on from there.

2181
02:23:19,131 --> 02:23:21,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know McCartney really knows what this game is all about.

2182
02:23:22,779 --> 02:23:25,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure these are going to give you deep, compelling gameplay tidbits.

2183
02:23:46,744 --> 02:23:47,845
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

2184
02:23:48,105 --> 02:23:49,646
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be pretty awesome.

2185
02:23:49,847 --> 02:23:52,689
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the Beatles... Oh, this is necessary.

2186
02:23:52,709 --> 02:23:53,810
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so necessary.

2187
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:54,650
[SPEAKER_04]: This is necessary.

2188
02:23:54,931 --> 02:24:00,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Next to Rock Band Journey, this is the most important title they could possibly do.

2189
02:24:00,916 --> 02:24:02,857
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I made a bad faux pas.

2190
02:24:02,877 --> 02:24:04,138
[SPEAKER_07]: George is the one that's dead.

2191
02:24:04,178 --> 02:24:05,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I meant Ringo Starr, not George Harrison.

2192
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:07,781
[SPEAKER_04]: George Harrison has control from hell.

2193
02:24:07,841 --> 02:24:09,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Ringo's got nothing.

2194
02:24:16,721 --> 02:24:19,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, it's, you know, Yoko.

2195
02:24:20,122 --> 02:24:21,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Yoko's got all the power.

2196
02:24:21,723 --> 02:24:23,003
[SPEAKER_04]: McCartney's got all the money.

2197
02:24:23,763 --> 02:24:26,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ringo's like, I was a beetle once.

2198
02:24:29,485 --> 02:24:30,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

2199
02:24:33,066 --> 02:24:35,127
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright, your British accent is probably better than mine.

2200
02:24:36,108 --> 02:24:39,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, yeah, this is a game that's very, very necessary.

2201
02:24:39,129 --> 02:24:44,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there hasn't been a big Beatles thing for this generation, you know what I mean?

2202
02:24:45,373 --> 02:24:49,775
[SPEAKER_07]: These kids today don't have anything to respect the Beatles with, if that makes any sense.

2203
02:24:49,795 --> 02:24:50,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Across the universe.

2204
02:24:51,036 --> 02:24:51,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I only count that.

2205
02:25:20,467 --> 02:25:23,289
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2206
02:25:48,083 --> 02:25:48,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

2207
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:10,722
[SPEAKER_02]: War on the scale of what was going on during that time.

2208
02:26:10,863 --> 02:26:11,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to me.

2209
02:26:12,264 --> 02:26:14,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know war of that type.

2210
02:26:14,345 --> 02:26:19,269
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have people being drafted and forced to go into a war that they don't believe in.

2211
02:26:19,789 --> 02:26:24,213
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have, you know, being stuck in such...

2212
02:26:25,033 --> 02:26:39,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And true, we do have the religious right trying to keep us in that phase, but we're going from a time of completely stodgy, everyone's the same, into complete individualism and a massive revolution.

2213
02:26:40,119 --> 02:26:43,140
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not talking the message, we're talking the music and the band.

2214
02:26:43,220 --> 02:26:44,621
[SPEAKER_04]: The music is the message.

2215
02:26:59,833 --> 02:27:01,114
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2216
02:27:26,952 --> 02:27:32,256
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get it on iTunes because of the big spat between Apple Computer and Apple Core.

2217
02:27:33,057 --> 02:27:33,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

2218
02:27:33,957 --> 02:27:34,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

2219
02:27:34,758 --> 02:27:38,861
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I don't think it's going to matter because I think everybody's parents are going to buy it.

2220
02:27:39,001 --> 02:27:42,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all these kids, I think the parents are all going to buy this stuff up.

2221
02:27:42,584 --> 02:27:44,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And even some of the kids, enlightened kids.

2222
02:27:44,465 --> 02:27:49,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I got to say, though, a lot of, you know, you said earlier a lot of the bands we grew up on were influenced by the Beatles.

2223
02:27:50,049 --> 02:27:54,693
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of these bands today I hear in interviews, I've heard a lot of them say they were influenced by David Bowie.

2224
02:27:54,953 --> 02:27:56,154
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a bad thing at all.

2225
02:27:59,139 --> 02:28:04,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm looking forward to Rock Band The Beatles or whatever it's going to be.

2226
02:28:04,963 --> 02:28:09,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for the fact that they're probably going to screw us and won't let us import the music into Rock Band 2.

2227
02:28:09,886 --> 02:28:12,208
[SPEAKER_04]: But, well, I mean, come on, you know you want to do it.

2228
02:28:12,248 --> 02:28:14,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the ACDC, that would be the only thing that made it worth buying.

2229
02:28:15,450 --> 02:28:20,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the fact that I could just dump it all into Rock Band, you know, and add to this stupidly awesome playlist already, but...

2230
02:28:21,193 --> 02:28:48,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see from the standpoint of someone who works in the absolute bowels of the industry I want to see how this game is going to sell when it gets to stores because there's not really any buzz about it I don't have people standing in line to reserve the Beatles I don't have people standing in line to reserve even Guitar Hero Metallica I think the Guitar Hero fad is kind of starting to die and like I said earlier in the show how to run a franchise into the ground I think that

2231
02:28:48,724 --> 02:28:50,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're barking up the wrong tree.

2232
02:28:50,025 --> 02:28:50,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Who influenced the Beatles?

2233
02:29:18,001 --> 02:29:18,622
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's the thing.

2234
02:29:19,163 --> 02:29:20,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the passage of time.

2235
02:29:20,545 --> 02:29:25,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know why they became what they became.

2236
02:29:25,932 --> 02:29:27,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I influenced the Beatles.

2237
02:29:27,474 --> 02:29:29,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Drugs influenced the Beatles.

2238
02:29:29,657 --> 02:29:31,640
[SPEAKER_04]: What bands did the Beatles listen to?

2239
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:34,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we could go on the internets and look it up and find out.

2240
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:36,305
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2241
02:29:53,482 --> 02:29:53,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

2242
02:30:18,155 --> 02:30:19,836
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple comments from chatroom I gotta read.

2243
02:30:19,856 --> 02:30:25,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.orangeonradio.com Blackwolf says, I don't want it to be something that I can say, hey, I wish I could just import these into Rock Band.

2244
02:30:25,938 --> 02:30:29,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it's different enough to see it on its own merits rather than just another track pack.

2245
02:30:30,099 --> 02:30:31,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, and that's cool.

2246
02:30:31,900 --> 02:30:34,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you're in a party setting...

2247
02:30:35,345 --> 02:30:54,712
[SPEAKER_04]: and you want to play some Beatles and then you want to play some KC and the fucking Sunshine Band and you want to play some Metallica and you want to play some Who and you want to play some this and you want to play some that, you're not going to bust out the Rock Band 2 disc that has 500 songs on it and put in the Beatles disc that has 40 songs on it to play a couple songs.

2248
02:30:54,792 --> 02:30:57,633
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to sit on the shelf if you're hardcore enough to own it.

2249
02:30:58,662 --> 02:31:00,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they do a disc swap thing like SingStar does.

2250
02:31:00,984 --> 02:31:01,704
[SPEAKER_04]: That could happen.

2251
02:31:01,764 --> 02:31:05,027
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, you don't jump up and just go, I'm going to switch discs, yes!

2252
02:31:05,367 --> 02:31:08,891
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be like, man, I'm going to play some other song.

2253
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:11,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, SingStar's awesome.

2254
02:31:11,773 --> 02:31:15,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bullymania in chat says, SingStar ABBA went back in time and influenced the Beatles.

2255
02:31:16,317 --> 02:31:16,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2256
02:31:17,458 --> 02:31:24,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, though, when we used to play... We used to play... What the hell game was it?

2257
02:31:25,525 --> 02:31:29,409
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Beat Mania, when we used to switch out our appendisks.

2258
02:31:29,889 --> 02:31:30,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, the appends.

2259
02:31:31,211 --> 02:31:32,091
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all into it.

2260
02:31:32,272 --> 02:31:33,593
[SPEAKER_07]: It was kind of a pain in the ass, though.

2261
02:31:33,613 --> 02:31:34,294
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a good point.

2262
02:31:34,314 --> 02:31:37,496
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was all we had, and now there's a better way.

2263
02:31:38,057 --> 02:31:38,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I will own...

2264
02:31:40,782 --> 02:31:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: The Beatles, whether it's the rock band Beatles, whether it's what.

2265
02:31:43,644 --> 02:31:47,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm of not that generation, but the generation after.

2266
02:31:47,027 --> 02:31:53,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have the Beatles on my iPod, even though I don't own any vinyl.

2267
02:31:53,892 --> 02:31:58,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the music, especially some of the later stuff.

2268
02:31:58,175 --> 02:32:00,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The earlier stuff just doesn't do it for me.

2269
02:32:00,457 --> 02:32:02,198
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just like you know they're important.

2270
02:32:02,278 --> 02:32:05,501
[SPEAKER_04]: You know you should own it if you're into...

2271
02:32:06,838 --> 02:32:18,244
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're into the niche, and I mean it's not really even a niche, but if you're into the part of the industry which we are, which is music games, if you own Drumania controllers, you should probably own this fucking game.

2272
02:32:19,245 --> 02:32:22,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't, it's going to depend on how big of a Beatles fan you are.

2273
02:32:23,783 --> 02:32:27,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless they completely bastardize it, which is a possibility, sadly.

2274
02:32:27,985 --> 02:32:28,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Which totally is.

2275
02:32:28,846 --> 02:32:30,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't really believe that.

2276
02:32:31,107 --> 02:32:33,108
[SPEAKER_07]: With Yoko having control, I don't believe it either.

2277
02:32:33,569 --> 02:32:35,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not just Yoko having control.

2278
02:32:35,810 --> 02:32:40,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Because take Yoko and John Lennon and the Dead Beatles and the Living Beatles and all that out of it.

2279
02:32:42,093 --> 02:32:42,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix...

2280
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:50,303
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to have such reverence for the source material that there is no possible way.

2281
02:32:50,544 --> 02:32:50,844
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2282
02:32:50,904 --> 02:32:53,105
[SPEAKER_07]: If they fuck it up, there will be no forgiveness.

2283
02:32:53,165 --> 02:32:53,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

2284
02:32:54,065 --> 02:33:00,809
[SPEAKER_04]: If they mess it up, there will be torches and pitchforks and people will be dying.

2285
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:26,637
[SPEAKER_04]: and I mean well that's you laugh but I mean that's all there is no that's true it's very true it's gonna be brutal the fallout plus you know I mean if you thought the ET game fallout was bad no yeah well and there's there's money being thrown at this I mean this this is an expensive project for EA this is uh this is a deal breaker for Harmonix if if they mangle this you know it's it's over

2286
02:33:26,977 --> 02:33:27,978
[SPEAKER_07]: But Actdeft has a point.

2287
02:33:28,038 --> 02:33:29,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Harmonix never ever fails to deliver.

2288
02:33:29,759 --> 02:33:34,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix has very rarely failed in any way, shape, or form.

2289
02:33:34,723 --> 02:33:37,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Amplitude was a little disappointing after Frequency.

2290
02:33:37,505 --> 02:33:40,948
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I'm going to get some people being like, F you, pal, for that!

2291
02:33:41,268 --> 02:33:42,890
[SPEAKER_04]: But Frequency was just better.

2292
02:33:43,490 --> 02:34:09,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, F you pal Alright, we're going to open up Hey, if you want to tell Dan F you pal to his face F me You can call in right now Flip off your monitors, I'm flipping myself off 1877 Amplitude was a great game 1877 game OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio And you can tell Dan to F off right now Let's open up the Skype Let's open up the phones, we have a caller on the line Hi, who's this?

2293
02:34:10,606 --> 02:34:13,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Spazinator Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2294
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:21,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two or three really quick things regarding tonight's show.

2295
02:34:23,483 --> 02:34:33,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding the whole using of trained cats for advertisement, what if something goes wrong with the cats?

2296
02:34:33,625 --> 02:34:38,767
[SPEAKER_00]: What if there's like a catastrophe?

2297
02:34:38,867 --> 02:34:39,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Using the what?

2298
02:34:40,827 --> 02:34:42,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the trained cats for...

2299
02:34:43,694 --> 02:34:47,397
[SPEAKER_00]: The advertisement you mentioned in part A, I believe, of the show?

2300
02:34:47,417 --> 02:34:49,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, what was that?

2301
02:35:02,202 --> 02:35:26,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I said PETA's gonna write a nasty letter for one I don't know, I guess, I'm assuming these things are under watch I don't think they just have these kitties all roaming the streets aimlessly I mean, there's gotta be something where they've got the cats tracked somehow or the cats are, they're being watched which seems like a lot of fucking work for a stinking ad campaign but there's gotta be something they're doing

2302
02:35:26,562 --> 02:35:27,723
[SPEAKER_04]: No doubt, that's easily.

2303
02:35:27,763 --> 02:35:31,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I was like, I don't know if I had a mic when you guys were talking.

2304
02:35:31,046 --> 02:35:32,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was playing Street Fighter.

2305
02:35:32,587 --> 02:35:34,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the worst thing I've ever heard.

2306
02:35:35,849 --> 02:35:38,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand what the point is.

2307
02:35:38,752 --> 02:35:41,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people see a cat running around and they're just like, hey, it's a cat.

2308
02:35:41,914 --> 02:35:46,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I suppose if I saw a cat wearing a Fear t-shirt, I'd be like, hey, it's a cat wearing a t-shirt, but I wouldn't go, man.

2309
02:35:47,098 --> 02:35:48,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Fear, I gotta buy that fucking game.

2310
02:35:48,379 --> 02:35:50,080
[SPEAKER_04]: That gets me in the mode to play some MF in 360.

2311
02:35:50,180 --> 02:35:50,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

2312
02:35:52,302 --> 02:35:55,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Secondly, I know that you guys have been complaining about the wind out there in California.

2313
02:35:55,103 --> 02:35:56,123
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a whole lot worse.

2314
02:36:19,545 --> 02:36:29,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know if you guys have been paying attention to the news as of late within basketball days, but, uh, just in my, you know, my, in the neck of the woods, uh,

2315
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:33,372
[SPEAKER_00]: We just hit kind of a semi-major plane crash.

2316
02:36:33,512 --> 02:36:35,033
[SPEAKER_07]: You live in Buffalo, don't you?

2317
02:36:35,393 --> 02:36:36,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I just remembered.

2318
02:36:36,794 --> 02:36:38,135
[SPEAKER_04]: You got this all wrong, by the way.

2319
02:36:38,275 --> 02:36:41,977
[SPEAKER_04]: We probably actually kind of like the wind, because wind is cool.

2320
02:36:42,377 --> 02:36:45,919
[SPEAKER_04]: We hate the fact that at the sign of a stiff breeze, our internet goes down.

2321
02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:50,902
[SPEAKER_04]: People forget how to drive, and shit starts falling over.

2322
02:36:50,922 --> 02:36:53,384
[SPEAKER_07]: The storms here are nothing compared to the East Coast.

2323
02:36:53,404 --> 02:36:54,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you, nothing compared to the East Coast.

2324
02:36:54,965 --> 02:36:56,025
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have hurricanes here.

2325
02:36:56,065 --> 02:36:57,446
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had a hurricane here, we'd all die.

2326
02:36:57,586 --> 02:36:58,207
[SPEAKER_07]: We would be dead.

2327
02:37:10,286 --> 02:37:21,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, this... I swear, it's... I really don't have a problem with driving in wind because I have driven in heavy wind.

2328
02:37:22,075 --> 02:37:25,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just seeing how many people can.

2329
02:37:25,297 --> 02:37:27,498
[SPEAKER_02]: People running around with chickens with their heads cut off.

2330
02:37:27,558 --> 02:37:28,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nuts.

2331
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:34,341
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, yes, I definitely have seen the news and I heard about that plane crash in Buffalo and just what a tragedy.

2332
02:37:34,381 --> 02:37:38,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's really no other word to describe it because nobody was drunk.

2333
02:37:38,202 --> 02:37:39,343
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't carelessness.

2334
02:37:39,383 --> 02:37:43,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It was at least, you know, everything I've heard says it was, you know, it was an ice thing causing a malfunction.

2335
02:37:43,644 --> 02:37:48,345
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was just a tragedy and very, very sad.

2336
02:37:48,365 --> 02:37:51,746
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, I can just imagine there's just reporters and the media and

2337
02:37:52,206 --> 02:37:53,087
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

2338
02:38:07,541 --> 02:38:10,021
[SPEAKER_04]: and not have anyone get killed on like every flight.

2339
02:38:10,081 --> 02:38:11,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some sort of goddamn miracle worker.

2340
02:38:11,882 --> 02:38:12,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

2341
02:38:12,382 --> 02:38:13,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy is from California, by the way.

2342
02:38:13,962 --> 02:38:17,763
[SPEAKER_04]: He's from the wonderfully named town of Danville.

2343
02:38:17,943 --> 02:38:18,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that.

2344
02:38:18,663 --> 02:38:19,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard about that.

2345
02:38:19,263 --> 02:38:19,643
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there you go.

2346
02:38:19,763 --> 02:38:26,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Spaz, I'm really sorry to hear about that, but hopefully it's, I mean, you're calling us, so you must be okay and that wasn't in your neck of the woods, so I'm glad to hear that at least.

2347
02:38:28,125 --> 02:38:35,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I let you guys go, would you be ready if I give a really, really quick shout out to my link showing Final Fantasy XI?

2348
02:38:37,078 --> 02:38:37,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, why not?

2349
02:38:37,819 --> 02:38:39,180
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a lot of plugs tonight.

2350
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:39,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it.

2351
02:38:39,881 --> 02:38:41,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out Suck, don't do it.

2352
02:38:42,002 --> 02:38:59,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just want to say hi to Doc Fury, Link John, the Alexander server, specifically Nagi and Meg and Axel Zero and everyone else on Lizzy Techist who is online right now.

2353
02:38:59,657 --> 02:39:01,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to say hi to everyone.

2354
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:02,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, shout out you guys.

2355
02:39:02,701 --> 02:39:03,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Now go play a real MMO.

2356
02:39:04,042 --> 02:39:04,542
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

2357
02:39:04,642 --> 02:39:05,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so kidding.

2358
02:39:05,483 --> 02:39:07,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you so stole the words out of my mouth.

2359
02:39:07,865 --> 02:39:10,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be like, now please sell your copies.

2360
02:39:11,007 --> 02:39:15,510
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I'm just bitter because I spent so many years on Final Fantasy XI, but you know what?

2361
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:17,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard they made a lot of good changes for the better.

2362
02:39:18,012 --> 02:39:24,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to not give it shit, but I would like to see them, you know, because Final Fantasy XI is over, like what?

2363
02:39:24,497 --> 02:39:25,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost six years old now.

2364
02:39:25,618 --> 02:39:27,199
[SPEAKER_07]: The benchmark program is awesome.

2365
02:39:27,359 --> 02:39:28,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see them do a new one.

2366
02:39:29,521 --> 02:39:34,144
[SPEAKER_04]: My and Jamie's new computers absolutely destroy the Benchmark program.

2367
02:39:34,184 --> 02:39:36,025
[SPEAKER_04]: The Benchmark program is awesome.

2368
02:39:36,045 --> 02:39:37,226
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just loaded with Tarot Tarots.

2369
02:39:37,306 --> 02:39:41,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, they're just like... I will say, Final Fantasy XI did bring us Tarot Tarots.

2370
02:39:42,129 --> 02:39:43,730
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Spazinator, we're going to let you go, buddy.

2371
02:39:44,731 --> 02:39:45,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.

2372
02:39:45,231 --> 02:39:45,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.

2373
02:39:45,832 --> 02:39:46,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

2374
02:39:47,473 --> 02:39:47,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

2375
02:39:48,473 --> 02:39:54,077
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I'm reminded by the chat room that the Hello Kitty Online beta opened yesterday, so that's something I might need to check out.

2376
02:39:54,638 --> 02:39:55,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Kitty, Bob.

2377
02:39:55,878 --> 02:39:57,900
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the MMO you ought to be playing.

2378
02:39:59,983 --> 02:40:01,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello Kitty, Jason, Clan Member 3000 Hello Kitty, Jason, Clan Member 3000

2379
02:40:27,896 --> 02:40:32,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Kitty Clutch Clan Are you responsible for what's happening with the Black DS?

2380
02:40:34,003 --> 02:40:40,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't think that's right I'm going to back away slowly from these comments Jason, please put our show back on track What do you want to talk about tonight?

2381
02:40:41,343 --> 02:40:43,284
[SPEAKER_09]: That confused me a whole lot, but that's okay.

2382
02:40:43,644 --> 02:40:52,306
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting that Dan talks about that pilot that did the water landing being brought up in California because our news was all over the place because he went to school in Colorado.

2383
02:40:52,646 --> 02:40:54,967
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why he's good.

2384
02:40:55,227 --> 02:40:57,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he moved somewhere else and learned something.

2385
02:41:00,008 --> 02:41:01,629
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you call in to talk about tonight, Jason?

2386
02:41:02,827 --> 02:41:15,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Did people really believe that Nintendo on... You mentioned in Part A that the whole 3D room environment of the Wii when it was still codenamed The Revolution and all that.

2387
02:41:15,957 --> 02:41:17,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Did people seriously believe?

2388
02:41:17,578 --> 02:41:19,320
[SPEAKER_07]: You know there was people that believed it.

2389
02:41:19,660 --> 02:41:24,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will even admit, for like... There was a period of five minutes where I kind of wished it was true.

2390
02:41:25,004 --> 02:41:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't true...

2391
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:33,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, there's something really funny you can say about that because the first five minutes of the trailer, you can completely believe.

2392
02:41:34,023 --> 02:41:37,224
[SPEAKER_09]: The first half of that trailer was beautiful.

2393
02:41:37,805 --> 02:41:40,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It was amazing.

2394
02:41:40,826 --> 02:41:42,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Dan.

2395
02:41:42,167 --> 02:41:45,208
[SPEAKER_04]: We just believed that Nintendo was going to fuck us up for life.

2396
02:41:45,908 --> 02:41:48,930
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to come out with something that was so badass.

2397
02:41:49,470 --> 02:41:53,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a video game system that you play and it sucks your dick while you're doing it.

2398
02:41:53,732 --> 02:41:54,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

2399
02:41:54,652 --> 02:41:58,254
[SPEAKER_04]: You just couldn't resist its awesomeness.

2400
02:41:58,294 --> 02:42:00,135
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they gave us the Wii.

2401
02:42:00,956 --> 02:42:04,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it was supposed to be totally revolutionary.

2402
02:42:04,417 --> 02:42:06,438
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a system called the Revolution.

2403
02:42:06,618 --> 02:42:10,260
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be something very awesome.

2404
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:12,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but a game system that fucks me while I play it.

2405
02:42:12,521 --> 02:42:13,542
[SPEAKER_07]: That's revolutionary.

2406
02:42:13,562 --> 02:42:13,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Just

2407
02:42:14,322 --> 02:42:16,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It was going to be something completely different.

2408
02:42:16,804 --> 02:42:25,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead, we got the last generation of console again with a controller that gets grandmas don't want to play.

2409
02:42:25,732 --> 02:42:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, I guess, good for everybody.

2410
02:42:28,694 --> 02:42:31,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Even grandma would play a Fuck Me Revolution.

2411
02:42:31,197 --> 02:42:31,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

2412
02:42:32,538 --> 02:42:34,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, who would Konami sue then?

2413
02:42:37,182 --> 02:42:42,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, though, it's a great console for everybody but gamers.

2414
02:42:44,065 --> 02:42:47,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's a great concept for gamers with really low standards.

2415
02:42:49,909 --> 02:42:50,790
[SPEAKER_07]: And low self-esteem.

2416
02:42:51,530 --> 02:42:51,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2417
02:42:53,792 --> 02:42:57,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, because of course it's low self-esteem because, you know, your Nintendo keeps telling you you're fat.

2418
02:42:58,455 --> 02:43:01,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo goes, you're fat, you're ugly, you're stupid.

2419
02:43:01,117 --> 02:43:02,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever set that up?

2420
02:43:02,358 --> 02:43:03,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you halfway fit?

2421
02:43:03,278 --> 02:43:03,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

2422
02:43:05,245 --> 02:43:13,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you set it up, and you make your me stand there, and he's looking all nice and confident, and then you jump on that board, and it detects what you weigh, and then the guy just sort of slouches.

2423
02:43:13,852 --> 02:43:14,833
[SPEAKER_04]: And then gets fat.

2424
02:43:15,073 --> 02:43:17,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, it starts harassing you.

2425
02:43:17,715 --> 02:43:20,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, this is more accurate for what you are.

2426
02:43:21,117 --> 02:43:21,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2427
02:43:21,978 --> 02:43:26,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Brain Age, and my DS told me I was stupid.

2428
02:43:27,903 --> 02:43:31,446
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient.

2429
02:43:31,506 --> 02:43:33,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, F you, pal.

2430
02:43:35,114 --> 02:43:37,216
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't understand the word blue, stupid!

2431
02:43:37,356 --> 02:43:39,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The next time I see Reggie, I'm gonna punch him in the face.

2432
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:44,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Which gets hundreds of thousands of hits on the entire webs.

2433
02:43:46,567 --> 02:43:47,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I don't know.

2434
02:43:47,688 --> 02:43:50,130
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that what Nintendo's done isn't

2435
02:43:51,179 --> 02:43:51,600
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

2436
02:44:14,002 --> 02:44:18,486
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii is going to take your mother out to date and then sex her.

2437
02:44:18,826 --> 02:44:23,390
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii is going to get your mom out the house so that you can have orgasmic video game experiences.

2438
02:44:23,811 --> 02:44:26,373
[SPEAKER_04]: We were ready for that and what we got was the Wii.

2439
02:44:27,113 --> 02:44:29,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I mean, did we believe it?

2440
02:44:29,616 --> 02:44:29,956
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2441
02:44:30,076 --> 02:44:31,697
[SPEAKER_04]: But did we speculate about it?

2442
02:44:31,797 --> 02:44:32,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2443
02:44:32,698 --> 02:44:36,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, we've got my mom who won't get off the fucking TV because she's playing Elebits.

2444
02:44:36,622 --> 02:44:37,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we've got now.

2445
02:44:37,542 --> 02:44:39,764
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know it was going to be the GameCube 2, you know?

2446
02:44:44,252 --> 02:44:47,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I just... You guys talking about it just made me think about that trailer.

2447
02:44:47,676 --> 02:44:56,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, the first half of it was great, but as soon as it said Nintendo on, the music changed and he actually tried to make up what the system was going to be.

2448
02:44:58,488 --> 02:44:59,409
[SPEAKER_09]: If... Oh, God.

2449
02:44:59,970 --> 02:45:00,090
[SPEAKER_09]: The...

2450
02:45:01,623 --> 02:45:02,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what to do.

2451
02:45:02,724 --> 02:45:06,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how to describe the people that believe the second half of that trailer.

2452
02:45:06,926 --> 02:45:09,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario looked like Luigi for crying out loud.

2453
02:45:09,328 --> 02:45:11,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo has never done that.

2454
02:45:12,170 --> 02:45:15,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Has never made concept art that looks that bad.

2455
02:45:15,452 --> 02:45:16,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Mushroom Kingdom was in a forest.

2456
02:45:17,293 --> 02:45:19,534
[SPEAKER_09]: The video just cut out abruptly.

2457
02:45:20,895 --> 02:45:20,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And

2458
02:45:22,541 --> 02:45:24,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Virtual environments don't exist.

2459
02:45:24,441 --> 02:45:25,742
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't make games on it.

2460
02:45:25,762 --> 02:45:29,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess there's RPG Maker, but yeah, that made good games.

2461
02:45:29,763 --> 02:45:30,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

2462
02:45:31,103 --> 02:45:34,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Nintendo trying to convince you that the world was going to change.

2463
02:45:34,704 --> 02:45:37,364
[SPEAKER_07]: If the fanboys believe it's strong enough, it will come.

2464
02:45:37,584 --> 02:45:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2465
02:45:38,425 --> 02:45:41,085
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to say, look, the 360, you think that's great?

2466
02:45:41,445 --> 02:45:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you see what we got for you.

2467
02:45:42,845 --> 02:45:49,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that Sony was the master of in the last generation, and they used that to bury the Dreamcast.

2468
02:45:50,162 --> 02:45:54,845
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dreamcast is great, but wait till you see what the PlayStation 2 does.

2469
02:45:55,145 --> 02:45:57,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the PlayStation 2 is going to mess you up for life.

2470
02:45:57,146 --> 02:46:00,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were sort of right, but they used it to bury the system.

2471
02:46:00,428 --> 02:46:03,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo just did the same thing, and it worked.

2472
02:46:04,131 --> 02:46:07,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It fucking worked again from Nintendo.

2473
02:46:07,213 --> 02:46:09,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo watched Sony and just learned.

2474
02:46:09,434 --> 02:46:14,758
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, look, we're going to sit out this generation with this little GameCube and we're going to put out some good games for the hardcore.

2475
02:46:15,098 --> 02:46:17,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But the next generation, we're going to dominate again.

2476
02:46:17,620 --> 02:46:18,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

2477
02:46:18,581 --> 02:46:19,061
[SPEAKER_04]: They did.

2478
02:46:19,301 --> 02:46:20,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what Nintendo does.

2479
02:46:21,003 --> 02:46:25,026
[SPEAKER_04]: They learn from their mistakes and they conquer the goddamn world.

2480
02:46:25,726 --> 02:46:27,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the DS has done it.

2481
02:46:27,668 --> 02:46:31,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember when the DS came out, everybody was like, wow.

2482
02:46:32,091 --> 02:46:34,072
[SPEAKER_04]: They replaced the GBA with this.

2483
02:46:34,473 --> 02:46:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing sucks.

2484
02:46:36,614 --> 02:46:37,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at the DS now.

2485
02:46:38,455 --> 02:46:40,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It's standard gamer equipment.

2486
02:46:40,896 --> 02:46:43,917
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have one, there's something wrong with you.

2487
02:46:44,897 --> 02:46:48,639
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Wii is kind of the same way, except for the fact that gamers own it.

2488
02:46:48,659 --> 02:46:50,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they look at me and they go, well, what should I buy for it?

2489
02:46:50,619 --> 02:46:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, Mario Kart and Smash Brothers are both worth owning.

2490
02:46:54,141 --> 02:46:55,261
[SPEAKER_04]: And Zelda's always fun.

2491
02:46:55,661 --> 02:46:58,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't own Mario Galaxy, you may as well sell your Wii.

2492
02:46:58,462 --> 02:46:59,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it.

2493
02:46:59,283 --> 02:47:00,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Metroid Prime 2.

2494
02:47:03,083 --> 02:47:04,585
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still at least five games, I guess.

2495
02:47:05,386 --> 02:47:06,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all the Nintendo franchises.

2496
02:47:07,369 --> 02:47:09,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Jason, thank you for the lively discussion.

2497
02:47:09,813 --> 02:47:13,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, thank you while I have you on for all the hard work you and Digman did on the new website.

2498
02:47:13,538 --> 02:47:16,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks great, and I know the chatters are loving it.

2499
02:47:16,222 --> 02:47:18,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to love it, too, when we start filling it up with articles.

2500
02:47:18,986 --> 02:47:19,627
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very excited.

2501
02:47:20,357 --> 02:47:21,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what you have to thank me for.

2502
02:47:21,898 --> 02:47:23,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan was the one that carried that whole segment.

2503
02:47:23,739 --> 02:47:26,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Deakman was the one doing the whole website.

2504
02:47:26,641 --> 02:47:27,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Practically doing all the website work.

2505
02:47:27,942 --> 02:47:28,963
[SPEAKER_07]: You were the one calling.

2506
02:47:29,103 --> 02:47:29,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you helped him.

2507
02:47:30,684 --> 02:47:31,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the help.

2508
02:47:32,145 --> 02:47:35,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Deakman probably did the biggest chunk of that, but he used to get some props.

2509
02:47:35,808 --> 02:47:39,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, we're going to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show.

2510
02:47:39,170 --> 02:47:39,850
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to get out of here.

2511
02:47:39,870 --> 02:47:40,391
[SPEAKER_07]: We're running late.

2512
02:47:40,411 --> 02:47:42,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, guys.

2513
02:47:42,552 --> 02:47:42,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

2514
02:47:43,253 --> 02:47:43,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

2515
02:47:44,653 --> 02:47:50,558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually going to do it for the Skype line tonight, guys, because we've got to get out of here, especially if we're going to try and do some stuff with Street Fighter 4 afterwards.

2516
02:47:50,578 --> 02:47:53,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Justin TV is up again, but we'll at least maybe try to get YouTube or something.

2517
02:47:53,621 --> 02:47:55,163
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I restarted my computer because...

2518
02:47:56,499 --> 02:47:58,321
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2519
02:48:16,597 --> 02:48:38,412
[SPEAKER_08]: and my friends online told me to use the shift, use the S key, it still won't work I'm not worried about that because I haven't really done any actual updates with this in a while so I need to do service pack 3 and that kind of stuff but it's still kind of funny because it's annoying because all my icons disappear and then they come back and then they disappear and come back and disappear and come back

2520
02:48:39,352 --> 02:48:40,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

2521
02:48:59,127 --> 02:48:59,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Flash Media Encoder to work.

2522
02:49:26,976 --> 02:49:28,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, wow, a night with no last minute stories.

2523
02:49:29,637 --> 02:49:31,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

2524
02:49:31,698 --> 02:49:35,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan, thank you so much for being here once again and contributing.

2525
02:49:37,041 --> 02:49:41,963
[SPEAKER_07]: We always love your opinions and such, especially being a long time gaming fan.

2526
02:49:42,303 --> 02:49:43,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Come back again sometime.

2527
02:49:43,703 --> 02:49:45,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, four or five years maybe.

2528
02:49:45,384 --> 02:49:46,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2529
02:49:47,145 --> 02:49:48,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be here next week if you want.

2530
02:49:48,245 --> 02:49:49,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Any final thoughts for listeners?

2531
02:49:51,187 --> 02:49:53,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Street Fighter 4 is absolutely legit.

2532
02:49:54,228 --> 02:49:54,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,

2533
02:49:55,171 --> 02:50:03,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the Xbox controller is a way of making fighting games a... It's like slamming your dick in a door.

2534
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:04,621
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not any fun.

2535
02:50:05,602 --> 02:50:10,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you buy Street Fighter IV for your 360 and you're not going to invest in an arcade stick, you're high.

2536
02:50:12,304 --> 02:50:15,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking about getting it for PS3 just on the controller alone, even though I know more people on 360.

2537
02:50:16,006 --> 02:50:17,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2538
02:50:17,947 --> 02:50:22,870
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, since you're right over there, enjoy the tea and the parting gifts from me.

2539
02:50:23,030 --> 02:50:24,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I so will enjoy the tea.

2540
02:50:24,270 --> 02:50:24,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2541
02:50:24,911 --> 02:50:25,831
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to let me know how that is.

2542
02:50:25,971 --> 02:50:30,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I might make you save me a bag, which I know is a dumpy thing to do for a gift, but I really want to try it.

2543
02:50:31,254 --> 02:50:32,775
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, shut up, Dan.

2544
02:50:33,175 --> 02:50:35,997
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts for listeners?

2545
02:50:36,797 --> 02:50:38,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I have tomorrow off because my voice hurts.

2546
02:50:39,259 --> 02:50:40,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Rub it in, why don't you?

2547
02:50:41,711 --> 02:50:42,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

2548
02:50:42,672 --> 02:50:43,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any final thoughts?

2549
02:50:44,353 --> 02:50:49,356
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just pissed off now because Explorer keeps crashing and reinstalling.

2550
02:50:50,556 --> 02:50:56,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to actually go do real updates because I've been just letting it do its crappy automatic update stuff.

2551
02:50:56,340 --> 02:51:04,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And my final thought is I would like to be over having clogged up sinuses now.

2552
02:51:05,685 --> 02:51:06,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you go.

2553
02:51:06,446 --> 02:51:07,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to prove it.

2554
02:51:07,406 --> 02:51:07,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2555
02:51:09,468 --> 02:51:10,088
[SPEAKER_07]: that's brisk baby

2556
02:51:39,628 --> 02:51:40,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do it anyway.

2557
02:51:40,270 --> 02:51:43,583
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you here next week for Orange Lounge Radio one more time.

2558
02:51:43,664 --> 02:51:43,845
[SPEAKER_07]: See ya.

2559
02:51:44,597 --> 02:51:47,338
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2560
02:51:47,878 --> 02:51:51,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2561
02:51:51,559 --> 02:52:00,181
[SPEAKER_05]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2562
02:52:00,681 --> 02:52:12,285
[SPEAKER_05]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2563
02:52:12,865 --> 02:52:13,685
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next week!

2564
02:52:15,494 --> 02:52:16,163
