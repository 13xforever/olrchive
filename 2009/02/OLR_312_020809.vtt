Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, February 8th, 2009, will Netflix on the 360 get a premium upgrade,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Time Crisis debuts on the iPhone,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
and is President Obama a new character in Street Fighter?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Here I am, Rob Roberts, with you every week, and also joining us, say hello to the one and only,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Back from her gray, wait, we didn't hear you, is the mic on?

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
It is now! Alright, there we go, back from the dead to join us here on Orange Lounge Radio

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
because she's been out a couple weeks. It was gray, very gray.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh yeah, you went to Prosser, Washington, Party Central America, how was that?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I went roller skating.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
People did roller skating to be cool like 20 years ago.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I love roller skating, but I found out something very depressing, Rob.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
What's that? Since I had, the last time I went roller skating was four years ago,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
I went with Jessica, of all people.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Oddly enough, having two car accidents where your hip gets injured means it's really hard to roller skate.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Especially when you're going one way and you're having to balance with your right leg and it hurts and ow.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Ow. So yeah, I murdered myself.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
But I played lots of stuff.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
We'll talk about that in just a minute, but I have to introduce everybody else who's here.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Hi. Hi, how are you doing, Loki?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm doing fine.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah? Fine?

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Well, I was in Oakland all day, so you can't really recover from it.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
And you didn't get shot?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I didn't get shot.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Congratulations.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Alright, we are very excited tonight here because if we sound giddy, it's because finally after like six weeks of being gone,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
we're finally back on Justin TV.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
So hi to everybody who's watching us there on Justin TV.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Justin TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Though again, I don't know why people want to watch us doing a radio show, but people seem to want to do it.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
But the reason why I'm giddy is because the audio now works.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And let me explain how this works real quick.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
The audio now works that they hear us through the mics.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
So the sound quality on Justin TV during the show is a lot, lot better.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
But I want to point this out.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
They're not going to hear the music or anything else.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
They're not going to hear background music when we're doing segments like Jamie's segment.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
They're not going to hear all that stuff because the way it's hooked up, only the mics feed into Justin TV.

02:38.000 --> 02:47.000
So if you want to hear everything, you still probably want to watch Justin TV but actually listen through All Games Radio at www.allgames.com

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
where we tape every Sunday night right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific time.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Let's introduce other people we have in the studio tonight.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
We have some very special guests tonight.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
I'm going to start with this guy behind me here who has not been to the show before.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
But he's someone I've kind of gotten to know a little bit recently and had listened to a few episodes of the show.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And I was like, well, why don't you come be on the show?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
So say hello to other Matt.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Matt number two.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Matt two, yes. How are you, Matt two?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm good. How are you, Rob?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
That's good to know.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So you've actually listened to a couple episodes of the show.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I have. I'm not an OLR virgin.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And you weren't freaked out.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
No, not too badly.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
We first met when somebody brought you over to my New Year's party.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
So we kind of like were talking and found out we had some things in common and so on.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
But you actually went away and listened to the show and weren't scared off.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
You still are talking to me, which is awesome.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
The next day I went to iTunes and I downloaded a recent podcast.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
So within 24 hours I was already listening.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Very cool. Well, sucker.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Really quickly, what kind of games do you like?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Since you've never been on the show before, we usually like to ask new people.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
What kind of video games do you play, if any?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I play a few. Mainly PC gaming for right now.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I do have an Xbox 360.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
But I mainly do the PC gaming.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Everything from first person shooter to MMORPGs and everything else in between.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Puzzle games, Prince of Persia, things like that.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Lately it's been WoW and Rock Band 2 have been dominating my time.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Nothing wrong with that.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Nothing wrong with that at all.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
WoW was dominating my time for a little while too.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Yes.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, but then I quit.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
But then we have Rock Band 2 I play a lot of as well.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
I have a question for you.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Okay.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Do you like old PC games?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
What do you mean old?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Are you a fan of Loom?

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
Never played Loom, but I go back as far as my online gaming experience goes back to X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter,

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
X-Wing Alliance, and organizing online gaming clans, if you will, with IRC chat

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
and organizing that on the old school MSN Gaming Zone, if anyone remembers that.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Do you ever do MUDs?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Do which?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Do MUDs?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I don't remember MUDs.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Old RPG stuff.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Old, old school.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Back in the day, so.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Descent, Descent was one of the first 3D games.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
I remember Descent and having it over 14 floppies.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
That's right.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
And Doom 2 had 6 floppy 3.5 inch diskettes.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Heck yeah.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I still remember all my cheat codes too.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Alright nerds, we gotta introduce somebody else who's here tonight.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
Let's say, this is somebody you always hear a lot about, but he hasn't been on the show too many times,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
but just in time for Valentine's Day.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
You know what?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm gonna let Jamie introduce tonight's special guest.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I think Jamie would do a much better job introducing.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
This is my personal parasite.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband, Dan, is joining us tonight on the show.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Dan, how are you?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Uh, hi.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
Thanks for that wonderful introduction, wife.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
Dan is the king of gaming in our house.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
He has more knowledge of classic games than I do.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
What I want to know is how much does Dan, your husband, have in common with Dan from Street Fighter?

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Next time I want Rob to introduce me, by the way.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I love Street Fighter.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I'm here to talk about Street Fighter 4.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Are you excited about Street Fighter?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
If I had more in common with Dan Hibiki, it'd be awesome.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm not even that big of a fighting game fan, and I have kind of a semi-fanboy boner going for Street Fighter 4.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
So fighting game fans must be at that point of no return right about now, because the game's about to be released.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
And it looks incredible.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah, I can't stop watching videos.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I prepaid for my $150 fighting stick.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Oh my god.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah, baby.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Well, if you're playing it on Xbox 360, though, you kind of have to have one of those.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
Because I'm seriously contemplating getting it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't picture playing Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 controller.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I'm getting it on the PlayStation 3.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Not even just because of the controllers.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
That's because I'm not going to play fighting games on live.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Because online gaming is already irritating enough.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Online fighting games are the worst thing to ever happen.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And unless you like them, then hey, go for it.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And honestly, I've got to play something on my PS3.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
That poor thing is lonely.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
I've got to introduce our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com, and they're always here to talk to us.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
By the way, I just want to say, Justin TV, you guys, we don't read the chat room over there as much because it's just too hard to look at two different chat rooms.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
So please, please, if you can, join us in the other chat, chat.orangelandtrader.com.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
The Rob D is in there, and he's a big fighting game fan as well.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
He says, I have the collector's edition preordered.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I'm going crazy.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I'm watching the World Warrior on loop.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I'm watching the Street Fighter cartoon.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm going to watch the anime movie the night before.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
Try working in a game store where we've had nothing but Street Fighter on all the demos for like a month.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
What kind of game store work do you do, if you don't mind me asking?

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
You don't have to say what company or whatever. I don't know what you can say or can't say, but what kind of game store stuff do you do?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I manage a game crazy.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Anyone who's listened to this store, this show forever knows I used to manage a GameStop.

07:57.000 --> 08:06.000
Now, it's not that there's anything wrong with GameStop, other than the fact that they're corrupt and evil and hate you.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
But I jumped to the other side.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
So it's not that it's any different. It's just smaller and hates you less.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
And I do want to point out now, tonight, we do have the whiteboard in studio.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
So we can now start, finally, our list of things that suck about GameStop.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
And I'm going to have Dan starting off the list tonight.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
They hate you, so I'll be writing that on the whiteboard here while we get into our gaming week.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, my past two weeks of gaming have been fairly diverse.

08:43.000 --> 08:52.000
I actually finally got past the stupid dialogue portion of Ragnarok DS and actually got to kill four porings.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
Ooh. Four.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Bling, bling, bling.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
It's pretty fun so far. That's really cute.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Dude, how do you get to prontera? Because that was the only word I could read.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
Because I know some Japanese. I can't read that much Kanji.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
So, oh well.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
And then, also, finally got through the damn forest on Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Because it was exactly what I said I had to do.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
One more level and I could do it.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
And then I played, we played R-Type Dimensions last night.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
And I have to say that it's really, really, really freaking sweet.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
Especially having unlimited content, unlimited ships.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Because R-Type is like freaking hard.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
It's R-Type.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
And this is actually harder than I remember R-Type being.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
So, and I wasn't really all that great at R-Type to begin with.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
But Dan and I played co-op last night and it was really fun.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
No, it wasn't last night. It was the night before.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Anyway, it was really fun.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
And I played, I saw something that depressed me.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
I saw the trailer for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
It's Civil War crap.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We hated it the first time, Marvel.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Stop it.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
It sucked. It was an awful storyline.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Stop it.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Do you hear me?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I read your Twitters. I'll tell you all.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
So anyway.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
And then, what else did I play?

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh yeah, I did actually play some Ragnarok Online for like, you know, an hour.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
And that was it.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
And I'm also, I also had a minor fan-gasm over Star Trek Online's character trailer.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
That looked hot.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Uh-huh.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
But I'm making our, when it comes out I'm making the official alien race of OLR.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
The OLR-ians.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Nice.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Seriously.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Are they gonna be orange people?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
No, probably not. Orange is a good color.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Copper.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Copper.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
I just, I insist I don't wear a red shirt.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It depends though. No, no, no, no.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
If you are, original Star Trek red shirt is the kiss of death.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
If you, in Next Generation, yellow is the kiss of death.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
If you're Voyager, prepare to suck.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Hey now.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
And if you're DS-

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I like Janeway. I'm the one.

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
And if you're DS9, it's the most awesome of them all and Enterprise doesn't exist.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Because really, it's Quantum Leap the future.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Okay.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Um, Trek nerds. We gotta get back to video games.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Oh, um, um, um, um.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Um, and, uh, I, uh, I did play something else.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Oh yeah, I'm also, I think I found an MMO to play though in the meantime that's free to play.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Um, it's Perfect World.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
My friend Heather plays it.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
And I've seen it, it's pretty cool, so I was gonna give it a try since it's free in that World of Warcraft.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
I've never heard of Perfect World. Give us a brief description of what this is.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Um, it's not World of Warcraft.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Oh, well then I'm sold, hey!

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
It's the same type of game though, but it has some pretty gorgeous environments and it's pretty cool.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
And you can actually ride a tiger.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
You can ride a white tiger.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I want a white tiger.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Can you get the eye of the tiger?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I've also decided something else completely unrelated to gaming.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I want a pet goat.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
She doesn't even acknowledge it.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
No, I'm not.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
I also decided that I want a pet goat while I was out of town.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
You can have my sisters if you want.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Really?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
No, she can't.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
She has four.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Do they have the cool rectangular pupils?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I don't care.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Wait, in real life IRL she wants a goat?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Yes!

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
No, my sister-

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Where the hell are you gonna put a goat?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
In the backyard!

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Exac-

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
Hey, well, you know, my sister is looking for a place to store her four goats, so-

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I want one goat so I can walk it on a leash.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Well, they suck.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
What are you gonna do with a goat?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Keep it as a pet!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I don't know, you can't-

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
What, are you gonna take it out and walk it around the block?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Yes!

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
My sister collects animals, apparently.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Is he gonna ride it to work?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
No, goats are too little to ride.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
They suck.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
There is nothing cool about goats.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
They just eat shit and then shit.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, they'll eat anything, so I'll just feed it, you know, Jaguar games.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
That's all they do.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
They just process grass into shit.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
That is it.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
But they're cute.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
They are not cute at all.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
They are goats.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Dad's goats are cute.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Okay, we're not talking about Harvest Moon here.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
And they're meat goats.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Video games!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Okay, your gaming week.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I was gonna say they're meat goats.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Goat free, I hope.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Yes, it was goat free, thank God.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
No, this week I didn't play hardly anything other than Grand Theft Auto IV.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
And I've been prepping my experience of Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
putting the right mods in place so that I can go in.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
And hopefully film something funny.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Just a little hint.

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
I found a skin to reskin Nico to look like Adolf Hitler.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
And let's see what else.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
Some other mods that flood stuff and, you know, crazy weapons.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
So it's gonna be the wacky world of Adolf Hitler.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Or maybe another Hitler, you know.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Hitler on Ice.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Hitler in the Matrix or something, I don't know.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Anyways.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Can I say some chat comments real quick?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Sure.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Because now they're on a goat kick.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Bob Coffee Away, I think, who forgot to change their name to Bob Coffee because they're obviously

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
there.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Bob Coffee says, zombie goats would be the best thing ever.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
That might be like a video game involving zombie goats.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Well, they did have Black Sheep, which was zombie sheep.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
That was an awful movie.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I saw that, you know, they had the trailer for that at the beginning of, what is it,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Death Proof?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
And it was actually a real movie?

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
ActDeafedInChat says, sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
I just posted a picture of the goats in chat because I love them.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Chat.orangelandstrategy.com.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh, haha, Brad.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
My sister seriously has her goat on her Facebook as one of her pictures.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
I am not kidding.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
She has, well, she had four of them.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
I think she has three now because one of them got attacked by dogs and died.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But, she has three goats.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Wait!

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Wait, I gotta tell you, this just proves goats suck.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
If like a bunch of dogs can take out a goat, they're fat.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
It was a pack of dogs.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
It was a pack of pit bulls.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Oh my god.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
That's a pack of angry dogs.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
The coolest thing about these goats is that they have rectangular pupils.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
And I am obsessed with that.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Is there a dogs who hate goats society?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
What is this?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
This is like-

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
No.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
This is her boyfriend's dogs actually.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
This is like Animal Farm for reals.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
They don't take care of them and they start going feral.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
So that's why they attack the goats.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Anyways, because they're hungry.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
So, she also has a bunch of birds and hamsters and shit.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
So yeah, she's-

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
She still needs to be a veterinarian though, right?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
So we kinda let her get away with it.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah, but she shouldn't have goats.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
She's in an apartment.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
She has to store them like in Rio Linda.

16:20.000 --> 16:29.000
Which, you know, for Rio Linda, they fit right in.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
But anyways, yes, they do have names.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't remember what the names are.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
Rio Linda is from Sacramento is at Morris to Mobile, Alabama.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh yeah, that's gonna help a lot.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Okay, it's the boonies of California.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Anyways, so yeah, that's my game week.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
It was just Grand Theft Auto.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
I meant to download Killzone 2 because I don't have it pre-ordered at GameStop.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, how will I ever get the demo that seems to be region-free?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
Maybe I'll create another free account in the UK!

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Oh no! I've bypassed her! Security!

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So yeah.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Wow. Alright, my gaming week.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't have a whole lot to share.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
After last week's show, you might remember Rice Princess was going crazy over the fact that I had the Resident Evil 5 demo.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
So we actually went in and played the Resident Evil 5 demo and it was pretty cool.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Yes, I'll give my impressions on that.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I was just like, heh, that's okay.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Was that your impressions?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah, it was just like, eh.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
That's kind of how I felt about it.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
It was alright.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Resident Evil is not a series I've ever gotten into.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I mean, I love zombies and stuff.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
There's another zombie series, of course, that I really got into that we'll be talking about later.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
I have to get this off my chest, I'm sorry.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I need to stop talking about this because I have to get this off my chest.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I've been waiting all night to say this.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
I played the absolute worst Xbox Live arcade game in my entire freaking life this week.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Worse than Yaris?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Worse than Yaris.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And they're actually charging money for this one, okay?

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
Apparently this is based off a game show or something, but I've never seen it before.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
And it is the worst fucking idea for a game I've ever seen in my life.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
It's called Merv Griffin's Crosswords.

18:04.000 --> 18:09.000
Oh my god, this game was awful.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Wasn't that actually a TV show?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
It is a TV show.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
I hope it got cancelled like five times because the setup of the show was stupid.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
The AI in the game was stupid.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
If they got an answer wrong, they would misspell words.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I didn't even understand how the game worked.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
And the clues were terrible.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Like, oh my god, this game was awful.

18:31.000 --> 18:37.000
I felt myself slowly dying being attacked by a pack of wild dogs or something while playing this game.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
It was so, so terrible.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
And I can't believe they're even trying to charge $10 for it.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh god, it was a horrible game.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Really, Merv Griffin's Crosswords.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
I think I would have saw Merv Griffin's Crosswords and been like, nope, sorry.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
Why don't they bring us a good game like old school Press Your Luck?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I know, for real, right? Bring us some good game shows.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I know, right?

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
Frisbee in Chat says, this game, S-U-C blank S.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Exactly how I feel.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
I wouldn't even be upset if they brought back Bumper Stumpers.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Bumper Stumpers was kind of like, how can you have Bumper Stumpers go on and on and on forever?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It was great.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Alright, forget it. Anyway.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
How do you man, did they bring a game of Double Dare?

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
VX JasonXV in Chat says, the game show itself is interesting.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Games based off of game shows tend to suck though.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
Look, I would rather play the are you smarter than a fifth grader game all day long

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
than have to play five minutes of Merv Griffin's Crosswords ever again.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
With Zombie Jeff Foxworthy?

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
Actually, all things considered, the are you smarter than a fifth grader game wasn't bad.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
I mean, for what it is, you know what it is, it's an adaptation of the TV show.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
If you don't like the TV show, then whatever, you're probably not going to like the game.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
For what it is, that live game is not bad.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
But this game was just not fun at all. At all.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Maybe because you weren't a fan of the TV show?

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
I never watched the TV show. I loved the Scrabble show back in the day.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
I like word game shows. The Scrabble show is awesome.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Lingo. I love Lingo.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
These are two games I would rather see on Xbox Live.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
You should have a game that you're an audience member at one of these shows

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
and you can yell at the contestants and get them to do stuff.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
But it may or may not affect the answers.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
This whole one versus a hundred thing that's coming to Xbox Live or whatever that is.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
What are they calling that? The whole shows on live on live or whatever it is?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
It's like they're not community games.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Hopefully it's like that.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Yeah, I don't remember what it's called.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Hopefully it's not. It'd just be like Xbox Live.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
But in true Xbox Live form, when the host gets up there, you just have to start yelling,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Fag, fag, fag, fuck, fuck, nah.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Never mind. I'm not going to...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
You know what else they say on Xbox Live.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Let's see. What else did I play this week as far as video games go?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I just was so obsessed with hating that game.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
I did play the new R-Type game. That was kind of fun.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
I got to say, that whole switching between 2D and 3D with a button was totally pointless,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
but it was kind of cool.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
It's like, I'm turning the 3D on. Oh, I'm turning the 3D off.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I'm turning the 3D on. I'm turning it off.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And Deep Man in Chat says, did you mention Left 4 Dead?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I did check out Left 4 Dead finally.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
One of our listeners was very, very kind and gave...

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I guess they bought a four-pack together, but only used three of the codes.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
So they gave me a code. I was very, very thankful.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
And I did check out the game for a little bit, but not enough to give impressions yet.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I haven't played enough at all.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
I got raped in like five minutes. That's how horrible I am at first-person shooters, okay?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
I was going down the stairs, and then some big fat guy comes down the stairs and rapes us all

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
because I don't know what I'm doing.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
So I need to figure out what the hell to do in this game.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
That's just Left 4 Dead.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
I guess so.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
But it's like, oh, the dude just threw up on your party member. You're fucked now.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
I was like, I don't know what I'm doing. I haven't even played this for five minutes.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Anyhow, yeah, that's going to do it for my gaming week.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
Matt, number two, did you play anything interesting this week you'd like to share with our listeners?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I'm just a big square, and I play a little bit of WoW.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm on that ever-long quest to hit 80 because I'm a noob.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But you have like 20 characters.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
I do not have 20 characters. I have one of every class on Narzul, which is my main server.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
And it's funny because we do have TrekkieNerds on the show tonight, and I think every time.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
Most of my characters are named after what I have affectionately called obscure Star Trek characters.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
So, for example, Kes, Seska, Neelix, Gum2, Darmok.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
And if you're a Trekkie, you recognize hopefully a handful of those.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
I recognize two of them as Voyager names.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
That's right.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Darmok and Neelix was really obscure.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
He was on for like six seasons.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
But he cooked and he didn't.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
He was a main character. He was in the opening credits.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
He was on Voyager!

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
He was a morale officer that became a security guy under Tuvok.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
So, obscure because you never really think of him. You think of Janeway.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Trekkie's 3.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Yeah, Trekkie's 3, exactly.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
What's that?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I have to ask, do you like Warp 11?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
No.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Sadness.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I'm sorry.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
My main mage is Malak, but I had to rename him to Valerian since someone took the name when I had the transfer service.

23:18.000 --> 23:25.000
So, hopefully one day Valerian will be 80 and then I will have to work on my other, as Rob calls him, 20 characters.

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
Bobcoffee and Chat says, I recognize all of those. I fail at life. LOL.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
We both fail at life. LOL squared.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
That was pretty much my gaming week.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
My Xbox 360 has unfortunately remained dormant these past few weeks because WoW has taken over my life.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Nice.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
Alright, speaking of Chat, I think they're previewing our new website in the chat room right now.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I was talking about it on Bobby's show, but I don't think I mentioned it here yet.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
We are going to be launching a new website soon and I think Deep Man was previewing it.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
And check it out in chat. It's pretty awesome.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
Dan, how was your gaming week? What kind of stuff have you been playing?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
It was awesome.

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
I pulled down HD Remix, the Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
And at first I played the demo and I was like, ah, super janky, no thanks.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
But as Street Fighter Mania gripped me, it was like, okay, I'll download it.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
And it's actually not too bad. It's a little bit easier than Super Turbo is normally, so that's pretty awesome.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
See, Rob, these are the people that encourage this kind of behavior, re-releasing games.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I know.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Oh, I'm terrible because I also downloaded R-Type Dimensions, which was, it kicked ass, you know.

24:34.000 --> 24:41.000
And I've got the remake of Bionic Commando. I'm a remake whore. Seriously, if it's a good remake, if it's a game that needs to be remade...

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Some of them are really good.

24:42.000 --> 24:51.000
Because of technology, I mean, I fully say remake it, but you've got to be real faithful and real respectful of the original material.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
See, I don't have a problem with the Bionic Commando one because that changed enough of it.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
They've added a whole bunch of stuff in it. It's not just like, okay, we made the sprites prettier.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Frogger.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Same game, you know.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And Frogger, yeah, perfect example.

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
R-Type, I'm not really sure if they changed anything to it, but, you know, Street Fighter, I mean, they just made the sprites prettier.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
Well, that was basically what they did with R-Type. I mean, it's R-Type 1, R-Type 2. It's got the 3D graphics.

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
They added a two-player simultaneous mode, which was actually kind of interesting, but...

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Cool.

25:20.000 --> 25:26.000
If you're an R-Type god and you could play through the whole game with no problem, yeah, it's still just R-Type.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
You are an R-Type god, though, from what I remember Jamie saying.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.000
Yeah, I could totally dust, like, the first three levels of R-Type 1, then you get to level 4 when the game gets hard.

25:34.000 --> 25:43.000
And, I mean, I don't care who you are, R-Type gets real, real hard. I could beat it on the consoles, but this R-Type Dimension is a hard version of R-Type.

25:43.000 --> 25:56.000
I don't know if your hitbox in that game is bigger or what, but, you know, there's a lot of shooters and stuff that deserve remakes, and so I do encourage that, you know, as long as it's respectful to the original game and it's a game that needs it, you know.

25:56.000 --> 26:03.000
Tigerclaw in chat makes a good case. He says, Bionic Commando remake was awesome. You get the Hitler head explosion in full 3D.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
True that.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
That is true. Very true.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
Alright, we're going to go ahead and get into some housekeeping tonight real quick, and then we'll finally get into some gaming news.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Hold on, hold on.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Oh, what?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
I have a few more things I want to add.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
No.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
Yes. Ah. What the hell, okay? I don't think we're talking about this tonight, so I'm going to mention it anyways.

26:21.000 --> 26:30.000
The Warriors on Xbox Live Arcade. They're making a new version of the Warriors game that's like, it's now like Final Fight, the Warriors.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Speaking of didn't need to be remade.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
And probably won't have Guy in it.

26:33.000 --> 26:44.000
It's just, it's, God, it's horrible. Why would they do that? The Warriors game on Xbox is so awesome. Just make that backwards compatible, and then we're done.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
I mean, I don't know. And I also wanted to say I saw Coraline in 3D and that was awesome.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
I want to see that.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
I haven't seen a 3D movie, at least with the new like real 3D or whatever stuff, and it was really sweet.

26:56.000 --> 27:04.000
Plus the polarized glasses. I think there's a way you can get your PC monitors to do 3D with the polarized stuff, so I'm going to play with that.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
Do you think that type of, you know, just totally random off the cusp question, do you think that type of technology might be coming to gaming someday?

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
Oh yeah, definitely. I think actually it's already coming to gaming.

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
They're going to show that off at E3 this year with Avatar by Ubisoft. It's going to be in 3D as well.

27:19.000 --> 27:27.000
And I wouldn't be surprised if it's polarized because that would make sense to me because it doesn't look that bad when you're not looking at it without the glasses.

27:27.000 --> 27:38.000
Because I was really surprised before. I'm just used to kind of like either the really weird blurry glasses or the red and blue stuff.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
So, you know, old school 3D stuff.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
But, I mean, the polarized glasses, it was weird because I put them on and I thought, oh, this is going to hurt my eyes and stuff.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
And I was like, wow, it's just looking like through normal glasses. But then, you know, the effect on the screen is really awesome.

27:51.000 --> 28:01.000
Well, a question for you. Do you ever, I think it's on the Wiimote hack website. There was the guy who did sort of the reverse by using the infrared sensors.

28:01.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah, the, I forget what they call it. Yeah, I haven't done that. Just, I don't know. I can't get my Bluetooth stuff to work right.

28:09.000 --> 28:17.000
If you can see the full 3D effect, even just watching a video of it, they should do something that would utilize that type of technology.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
Well, they were supposed to in boom blocks, if you remember, the developers want to do that.

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
But they somehow, someone said no and they had to take it out.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
It's going to be a little Easter egg in there where you could do it that way. I forget what they called it.

28:32.000 --> 28:44.000
But yeah, I think, I know like TrackMania, I think, does some sort of 3D thing. I don't know if it's with the red, blue glasses or if it's the polarized glasses, but that'd be fun.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
Because TrackMania is a sweet game. But that's it. Sorry.

28:49.000 --> 28:56.000
No, that's all right. That's all right. Let's talk about really quickly housekeeping. I pretty much said all I wanted to say about the new website.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Hopefully that will go live for everybody, not just during the show, but everybody will get to see that.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Maybe in the next week or two. It's going to be awesome.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
Regular content, again, I'm so excited. We can actually do reviews and all that fun stuff. It'll be great.

29:07.000 --> 29:16.000
Otherwise, just make sure to keep following us on MySpace and Facebook, at the O.L. Army on Facebook, and LiveJournal as well at Orange Lounge.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
What, Loki?

29:17.000 --> 29:27.000
I was just thinking, because it is sort of housekeeping, the E3 news, you know, the special guests that we're going to have doing special...

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
Oh yeah. I'm very excited about E3. That's all I have to say. Very excited about E3.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Yes, this year at E3 because...

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
I hope I can get in.

29:35.000 --> 29:43.000
I mean, I know I'll be able to get in. Getting my special guests in is going to be difficult, but we'll see.

29:43.000 --> 29:54.000
Anyways, possibly this year we will have Nellie coming in to do her Woman That Hates Gaming review of E3.

29:54.000 --> 30:04.000
Because we're going to go there for a couple days. We're actually going to a trip for Disneyland as well, because E3 happens to fall on her birthday.

30:04.000 --> 30:13.000
So she said, you know, I'm going to be very loving and I'll go with you. You can go to E3.

30:13.000 --> 30:22.000
And as long as we go to Disneyland and stuff, I'm fine with that. I can go into E3 maybe a day or two or something like that.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
I'm very excited to get the Wife That Hates Gaming interview. It's going to be amazing.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Alright, so we'll see. We'll see.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news. We're like a half hour into the show and haven't gotten to gaming news yet. So, Loki, please take it away.

30:33.000 --> 30:46.000
Alright. Well, speaking of E3, the exhibitor list has been revealed and some people that had dropped out before are back, including Activision Blizzard.

30:46.000 --> 30:53.000
They are back after dropping out of the last E3. But, I mean, who can blame them? The last E3 was kind of ehhh. I don't know.

30:53.000 --> 31:05.000
But, it's interesting though. Even though Activision Blizzard may be there, the Blizzard portion of Activision will not be there.

31:05.000 --> 31:17.000
But, I mean, I guess they did have a few things they could have shown off like Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2. But, I don't know. I mean, I don't really know when all that's supposed to come out.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
So, they don't really necessarily need to show that, I guess.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
What does Activision have that you want to see without Blizzard?

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Without Blizzard?

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
Blizzard has everything. They've got Starcraft. They've got Diablo. They've got whatever's next for Warcraft.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
Activision's like, well, we've got Guitar Hero.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Call of Duty.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
I mean, granted, they'll have...

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Well, Modern Warfare 2, sure, maybe.

31:40.000 --> 31:46.000
I'll give you a list of what I want to see from them. DJ Hero. The new Tony Hawk game, which is supposed to be...

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
I mean, granted, I want to see it. I don't want to buy it or play it.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Killing a franchise.

31:51.000 --> 31:59.000
It's the new Tony Hawk game where they're going to have an actual skateboard that you use for the game. So, that'll be interesting.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
They're trying to sell us for $200.

32:01.000 --> 32:08.000
Exactly. Maybe you see what they're going to do to innovate with Guitar Hero.

32:08.000 --> 32:18.000
And then maybe Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and possibly the new Transformers game just to see if it's really sucky or not.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
Well, hey, I know the first game blew.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Did you watch the trailer that's up on Kotaku for it?

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
Yes, and it doesn't look any better than the first game.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
But it's a different developer.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
It doesn't matter. It's a movie game. It's going to suck.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
It'll be bad in a different way, and not all movie games suck.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Okay, Wanted looks awesome, and that's going to be a movie game, of course.

32:41.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah, but it's not going to be awesome. You're watching the trailer and you're like, ooh, that looks like it might be good.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
Okay, yeah, Transformers, the new game trailer, there was nothing that said, hmm, I'm going to buy this. It just kind of...

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I mean, look at it.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
If you even spend money to rent that game, you're high.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
It's for seven-year-old boys who love the movie and have to keep on living it.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
It's not for gamers.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
But I want to keep on living the movie!

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Fine! Pirate it like the rest of us!

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
Okay!

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
But seriously, Activision has got nothing without Blizzard.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
In fact, they may as well just call the whole company Blizzard.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
Well, they also have Alpha, was it Prototype, which looks really awesome.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
That's Sierra, but yeah.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
They've got Modern Warfare 2. That's it.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I mean, and that should be Mankind.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
I'm excited about it.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
The hitball series is just waiting to make a comeback.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
No, it's not!

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
They try and stay dead.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
They try that every generation.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
They keep bringing it back and it sucks.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Didn't they already make one for the Wii?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Yes, and it sucks.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Okay, it started off as a port of the GameCube game and they fucked that up.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
And so they made it into this new game where they renamed it and it still sucked.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
Okay, speaking of porting GameCube games, who's not bitter that Pikmin is just the GameCube version with Wii controls?

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
That's all they're doing, is putting out all these GameCube games with Wii controls.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
Oh, no, no!

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Well, don't get me wrong, I'm kind of down with that whenever I'm a remake whore, but come on!

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
No, they promised us a new Pikmin.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
They are doing a new Pikmin.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
They're doing this, they're doing Pikmin and Pikmin 2, and then they're actually going to announce a new Pikmin at E3.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Do a game I want to play again, like F-Zero.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Oh, yeah.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Well, F-Zero on the Wii would be awesome.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Even if it's just GX, because that game was brutal.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
That better be the secret in Reggie's pants at E3.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
That's what they should be doing as one of the Wii.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
New play control games.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
Zip, ew, Falcon Punch!

34:32.000 --> 34:42.000
No, seriously, they should do a new play control version of F-Zero GX, because that'd be perfect, but instead of this Mario Power Tennis, really, was that such a great game that it requires...

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
No, Mario Power Tennis was pretty pimp.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
And come on, like Strikers, Strikers is awesome.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
Mario's aggressive death soccer is like the best game to ever happen.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
I still, still can't, you know, believe that that game is that good.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
I hate soccer, but I love that game.

35:00.000 --> 35:12.000
Sorry, I can't get that mental image now of Reggie Fils-Aime coming out at E3 and Falcon Punching us with his cock.

35:12.000 --> 35:21.000
I issue a challenge now to our listeners, especially the ones who were kind enough to do the kudaragi crayon eating picture.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
No, no, don't make a picture.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
We now want the Falcon Punch picture.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
No, no.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
I will, I will send someone a shiny silver dollar.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Keep it clean. Alright.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
That I ride on in Sharpie.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
Let's move on to something depressing to try and sedate the show a little bit here.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Sadly, THQ has laid off about 100 people on their staff.

35:45.000 --> 35:51.000
And, you know, sad trombone, but, you know, it was the mobile gaming division.

35:51.000 --> 35:58.000
And I don't mean to sound, you know, crass. I feel sorry for those people. You know, it sucks to lose jobs and stuff, and the economy stinks and everything.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
But, you know.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
Does THQ make anything besides SmackDown?

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
Yeah, they make a bunch of SpongeBob, you know, and Nintendo licensed games, and Saints Row 2, which I love.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Oh yeah, they did make Saints Row 2. That game was not so bad.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
Anyhow, well, here's the thing. They are actually going to be restructuring the wireless subsidiary.

36:17.000 --> 36:24.000
Apparently, though, they actually closed completely the San Diego Mobile Studio, as well, and some offices in the UK and Germany.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
They are still going to be cranking out some wireless games, though, out of Finland.

36:27.000 --> 36:35.000
They are Uni Versomo Studios, and I guess this means, I don't know, more Worms Mobile, things of that sort.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
They did a mobile version of Saints Row. I don't think it was any good, though.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
I don't know. If they did, like, Worms World Party for, like, the iPhone, I'd be down.

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
Yeah, I mean, again, I feel bad. I don't mean to joke about people losing their jobs, but at the same time, you know, mobile games...

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
No, it's cool. If you've got a job, just go for it.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
There might be good news for mobile things later on in the show we're going to get into.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
The only good news for mobile gaming is the iPhone, which is awesome.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
Well, that's exactly what we're going to get into a little later in the show.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Oh, well, then I won't spoil it.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
But for now, we'll get into some more gaming news, won't we, Dar Sakura?

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Yes, we will. Who likes Netflix?

37:11.000 --> 37:18.000
Me! I have watched seasons one and two of 30 Rock on Netflix on demand on the Xbox 360. It's great.

37:18.000 --> 37:32.000
See, speaking of Netflix on the Xbox 360, they did a survey that went out to a few members that was asking them if they would pay a little bit extra for premium content, like, from cable channels, like HBO.

37:32.000 --> 37:39.000
And it's sort of, I guess, rumored that it's going to be around, you know, ten bucks extra.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Don't encourage them.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
But, um, I don't know. I think some people would be excited by it.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Nobody will be excited by it.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
There are consumer whores.

37:49.000 --> 37:56.000
Look, I like the idea of offering some more of this premium content. Like, being able to watch the tutors on demand and all this kind of stuff sounds kind of awesome.

37:56.000 --> 38:05.000
Because I like that type of period piece fucking. Because that's what the tutors is. I don't know if you've ever watched it, but it's period piece fucking, basically.

38:05.000 --> 38:15.000
But here's the thing is that, then if they set the bar and they say, oh, we're going to charge this premium content for all this extra stuff on Xbox 360, then everybody's going to want to be premium content.

38:15.000 --> 38:26.000
I'm going to have nothing left to watch but independent documentaries about strippers that went to stripping because of Hurricane Katrina, which, yes, is an actual documentary I once watched on Netflix 360.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
That's all that's going to be left is Hurricane.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Awesome.

38:28.000 --> 38:39.000
Premium content, good. Paying more, bad. It's already $9 a month for the super basic level with the unlimited streaming, which is great through the Xbox. I love it.

38:39.000 --> 38:44.000
It's awesome. It's got me watching more TV than ever, which is really what society needed.

38:44.000 --> 38:49.000
But at the same time, it's like, oh, man, don't give them any reason to charge us more.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.000
It's giving us Doctor Who. We've got up to season four now, right?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
No.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
No?

38:56.000 --> 39:01.000
We have season four, but we're not paying extra for it. It just came with the Netflix.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Well, I'd be curious if you signed up for premium membership.

39:03.000 --> 39:10.000
It takes away subscribership from HBO, Cinemax, all that stuff from cable subscribers because now they can just download for a whole lot cheaper.

39:10.000 --> 39:19.000
The main shows like Big Love, Tutors, other Sopranos from back in the day, those types of shows I'm at, I would be curious to take away subscribership.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
That's a good question, but I wonder if they would care because they're still getting money from you watching their shows.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
So maybe they don't care. They still get their money one way or another.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
That's true, or the cable companies are maybe losing revenue.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Well, to hell with them.

39:30.000 --> 39:37.000
I'm sure that Netflix is actually paying a certain percentage to the premium channels for content.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
I mean, that would make sense, or else HBO would be like, bitch, please.

39:42.000 --> 39:53.000
Well, they pay a licensing fee for the movies that they use, but I mean, it's not like they're going to show The Sopranos every night after it comes on like they do CSI.

39:53.000 --> 39:59.000
Xlink in chatroom says, gives a very honest response. This is why I torrent. It's a very honest response.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
It's whether the legality is questionable or whatever.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Same here.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
Well, Dan says, why pay for what I conceal? But also, there's something to be said, just like iTunes.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Why do people actually use iTunes when you can go out and find the downloaded MP3?

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Because sometimes it's a pain in the ass to find the actual MP3.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Because I have an iPhone.

40:15.000 --> 40:21.000
Well, how convenient is it that you can just sit there, tap a button, and you will have the full song for just a buck?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
And it's legal.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
And you get the warm fuzzies, legal, supporting the artist, all that stuff.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
I get the warm fuzzies doing the opposite.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
Well, you're evil.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
That's because you're a pre-vert.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
All right.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Okay, that's not true.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
Netflix isn't really gaming, but at the same time, that's what people use their 360s for lately. At least I do.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
One million. One million subscribers.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
I spend more time on my 360. Seriously, if you look what I've done the past week, on the 360, I played that horrible Crosswords game.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
I played...

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Sweet.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Netflix.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
My PlayStation 3 is actually where I've been gaming lately, because I have Prince of Persia on PS3.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I've been playing that on Little Big Planet. I've been playing the hell out of.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
That's been my PS3.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
I'm actually using my...

41:02.000 --> 41:08.000
Which is weird, because I always thought PS3 was supposed to be the system that was going to be my all-in-one entertainment center.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
But, like, I'm the complete opposite lately.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
I don't know what the hell's up with that.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
I don't know.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
I use my PS3 for streaming stuff. It works pretty well.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
All right. Who cares? Anyway, it's all right. Let's move on with gaming news.

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
Gauntlet DS is potentially cancelled.

41:21.000 --> 41:29.000
This is coming from various retail sites that have been telling their customers it had a pre-order that's been cancelled.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
That it's been removed off of GameStop and some other retail websites.

41:35.000 --> 41:44.000
I know from a distributor standpoint, I think it was locked and basically put out of print.

41:44.000 --> 41:51.000
Which either means that it's got a to-be-announced release date, or actually it's cancelled.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
So, it's pretty much cancelled.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Could it possibly be in limo?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Like, might the game be changing hands or something?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
It could be. It happens a lot. In fact...

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
With Midway going through all the problems it's been having too, you know.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Thank you for reminding me too.

42:06.000 --> 42:11.000
That was something I got to touch on at a special time later on.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
There was something going through limbo.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Okay.

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
Anyways, it's very possible something like this. It looked okay.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
I don't remember being that impressed by it, because I did play it at PAX, but it was all right.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
Anything four player on the DS would be really cool.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
Four player with voiceover IP during the game.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Anything that you're waiting for from Midway, don't hold your breath.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
It pains me to say it, because I love Midway.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Me too.

42:39.000 --> 42:45.000
I love Mortal Kombat and a lot of their IPs, but that company is boned.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
It is too bad.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
They owe twice what their company is worth.

42:49.000 --> 43:00.000
The only solace that you'll get is the fact that probably the big studios that they own in the franchises will be snapped up by bigger, probably more stable companies.

43:00.000 --> 43:09.000
They'll all belong to EA or Act of Blizzard before it's all over, but Midway is going down the tubes.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
You've got to wonder how much Midway lost on that stranglehold or whatever that game was.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
They brought in that big, huge name director and they spent all this money marketing it.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
I think the game made a ploop when it landed.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
It's not just stranglehold. They've just had flop after flop after flop.

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
They have all these great franchises and they would try to bring them back.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
They did Spy Hunter for the PS2 back in the day, and Spy Hunter was great.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
So they're like, ah man, we'll do Defender.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Defender wasn't a bad game, but nobody cared.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And their treasures collections are awesome.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
The Midway treasure collections they did on Xbox, like the 20 old games, like Rampage.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Yeah, they sell hand over fist.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
You've got to wonder how they could be in that much trouble.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
I guess the development budgets on their not-whoring-out-at-all franchises have just been out of control.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was kind of their last hurrah, I think.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
I've got to read this comment from Chad, because this is a good point.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I apologize if I'm mispronouncing his name.

44:05.000 --> 44:11.000
In chat.orangetonshooter.com, Spike Guru says VOIP over 802.11b. Wouldn't that blow?

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
Because the DS isn't the most powerful wireless networking device.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Well, I mean, I don't know.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
They said they had it working, or maybe they couldn't get it working, and that's why.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
If they could make it work, you know.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
I don't really see how much you're going to really need voice for Gauntlet.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
I mean, it's nice, but it's Gauntlet.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
True, true.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
All right, well, maybe here's-

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Hit that thing with an axe! Quick!

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Grab the treasure!

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
No, my treasure!

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Quit dying!

44:43.000 --> 44:51.000
Elf shot the food.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Gauntlet, people!

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Well, I don't know.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
It's not that complex!

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Whoops, shot the food.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
Dan, maybe this is a game you would be more into for the DS.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
Lego Battles is a game that's going to be coming out on the Nintendo DS.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
It's coming from Warner Brothers and TT Games.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Robler's Tales.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
TT. Telltale.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
TT.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Titties!

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
It's a Lego-based strategy game, basically.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
I think Loki's kind of talked about this a little bit on the show before.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
Really?

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Did I?

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
Officially, now, out there, that you're going to be, like, having bases that you're building and defending.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
It's Lego castles, Lego's pirates, Lego's space-themed.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
You're going to have units that you can actually-

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
You can actually have pirates and space people in the same team.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
So, like, you can mix and match all this stuff.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
You can tell there's Lego ninjas that just don't matter.

45:39.000 --> 45:46.000
Well, actually, apparently, in the press release, you can have pirate swordsmen fighting wizards and aliens, dragons battling ninjas-

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
And that's going to be the greatest Lego game to ever happen.

45:49.000 --> 45:55.000
Pirate ships launching broadsides against spacecraft and knights.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And you can also play this game local multiplayer.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Sadly, no V.O.I.P.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
I'm sorry, pirate ship fighting a spaceship, that's just ridiculous.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.000
I mean, seriously, what, it's a pirate ship, got cannons and shit, the spaceship's like,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I'm just going to fly higher, bitch.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Oh, you're dead.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
They need to make a game like this, but, like, not Lego's.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
You need to go old school and get, like, the Blacktron Lego's in there.

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
No, no offense against the Lego's, but I want to see, like, dragons versus spaceships for real.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I'm a fucking Duplo in this shit.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
Duplo would totally dominate because they'd just be giant, indestructible blocks.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
It's my pirate ship.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
It'd be, like, tech level low, but resistance is, like, super high.

46:37.000 --> 46:41.000
And cost, well, cost of anything Lego is just through the roof.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Boy, it's like construction fighter.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
It could be Lego versus Mega Bloks.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
Lego's and Duplo's and Tinker Toys and Lincoln Logs.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
Have you seen the Mega Block Halo toys that they're doing?

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
You can get, like, Warthogs and Scorpion tanks and stuff all made of Mega Bloks.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
There's a franchise that someone should have jumped on.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
I know it was an April Fool's joke, but Lego Halo would have been sweet.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
The chat room is talking about, like, a Lego fighting game, and the Rob D says you could lose parts as you fight.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
That would be fun.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Yeah.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Just knock the blocks off of somebody. That'd be fun.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Lego Street Fighter.

47:16.000 --> 47:25.000
Did you see, um, speaking of Legos also, did you see the pictures someone did of the Starcraft 2?

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Yeah.

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
That person is my hero. That was the most awesome thing I've ever seen.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Very cool.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
Alright, so Lego Battle's coming to the DS, I believe the release date's summertime, so we'll see.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
April.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
April, that's in time for my birthday.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Nice.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Ninjas and Dragons on Jamie's birthday. Who could ask for more?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Rock.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
Well, for our UK friends, I'm so sorry.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
It's just that this game is coming out as making me laugh.

47:54.000 --> 48:00.000
They're bringing out a Coronation Street game on the DS, which is sort of like, as far as I know,

48:00.000 --> 48:08.000
it's sort of like a weird soap opera-y type show out there, kind of like, what is it, the other one, EastEnders?

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I think?

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
You look...

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
That wasn't on the mic.

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
Dan didn't say it in the mics, you guys didn't hear it, but he went way to cover the gaming news that matters.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
We have listeners in the UK.

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
I also want to point out when Loki reads release dates, he reads things like Imagine Teacher and Imagine Baby's Dance Party.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Hey, I want to cover everything, okay?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
So we have to cover everything.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
So we can make fun of it.

48:38.000 --> 48:45.000
There would be a hundred more people interested in what she's talking about than Imagine, you know, sitting around and fucking yourself.

48:45.000 --> 48:52.000
Because you know what, if we're going to read release dates that matter to me, we wouldn't be reading anything.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Can I get my story, please?

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Yes, you may.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
This is the official STFU for me, thank you.

49:00.000 --> 49:08.000
Anyway, yeah, Coronation Street is really, really popular, it has 78% of the UK's television audience.

49:08.000 --> 49:14.000
So basically it's like, if you're going to watch TV and it's on, that's the only thing to watch, I guess.

49:14.000 --> 49:24.000
But they're doing a DS game by, I don't really know too much about what's going into the game exactly as far as the play of it will be.

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
But it's supposed to be out for Christmas this year, so...

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
Yay, you get Coronation Street!

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Did you do a little Briton DS game?

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
That PlayStation 2 one was awful.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
Yeah, they did a PSP and PS2 game.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
What?

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Do not want.

49:47.000 --> 49:53.000
I think that Top Gear and Doctor Who are the only things that justify the continued existence of the BBC.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures. Whatever that is.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
Oh, and Primeval. Is Primeval still on?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
What's that?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Primeval, that's a good show.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
No, I haven't seen Primeval, but it might download to Merlin.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
And the new series for afterlife on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, that's pretty decent.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
It is, yes.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
So there's actually lots of good stuff on BBC, but it really is about Doctor Who.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
The staple of British television, in my opinion.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
And Top Gear.

50:28.000 --> 50:35.000
Going from something on the BBC to something that's very American.

50:35.000 --> 50:45.000
Godfather 2, EA has delayed the release of the game because apparently releasing Godfather 2 on the same day as Killzone 2, not a good idea.

50:45.000 --> 50:53.000
So they decided to hold it off a little bit. I believe now it's coming out the second quarter.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
Beginning of April, probably.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
So, cool. I don't know. I'm not too excited about Godfather. I didn't play the first one.

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
I mean, it's my type of game because it is like a Grand Theft Auto sandbox type of thing.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
You owe it to yourself to pick it up and try it.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
It actually is a pretty sick game as long as you don't get too much respect.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
Because then you stop being able to shake the crap out of people and make them bend your will.

51:15.000 --> 51:22.000
Because you can just walk into a store and just grab the dude and beat him up until he gives you what you want and you'd be like, that's awesome.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Sweet.

51:23.000 --> 51:30.000
See, I'm wondering if Godfather 2, because I haven't read much about it, if it takes place further in the past, like when Vito Corleone was a kid.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Or if it's going to be just like, oh, there's more Godfather.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I think it's a continuation.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
That's not as cool.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
And they basically have now online multiplayer as well.

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
Yeah, that's probably mostly the whole attraction.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
Multiplayer would be fun, though. Then you can slap your friends.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I want a Scarface, too.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
Scarface, you know, and it was kind of like, oh, he didn't die.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
He didn't die and he did it all again because he was so happy the first time.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
Told him a tenner and I'm an idiot. Jesus.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
All right. As long as this time when they do the portable versions, they don't make them into strategy games.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
Because seriously, everyone comes to my store and wants to buy the portable Scarface game.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
And I'm like, fine, buy it. Then they bring it back like ten minutes later.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
What is this crap? It's a strategy game.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Well, you should have read the back of the book.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
I wanted to run around and shoot people. I'm talking right now.

52:26.000 --> 52:32.000
This is why people need to read the reviews and look at the back of the box. Dumbasses.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
All we have is a disc. Can you look at the back of the disc?

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
I'm saying in general, Dan, and people, you can look online and find reviews.

52:43.000 --> 52:49.000
I think it's a safe assumption that if the box looks the same and it's on the PS2 and the PSP, it should be largely the same game.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
But it's not. So you're right. Kind of.

52:52.000 --> 53:01.000
Oh, and I was going to say, too, I mean, we shouldn't, you know, be harking too much on the UK for having a TV drama being turned into a game.

53:01.000 --> 53:07.000
Because after all, Ubisoft is bringing out Grey's Anatomy for the DS and the Wii.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It could have played like Trauma Center.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
It is supposed to play like Trauma Center, but with more drama.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Aren't they downsizing that team?

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Sadly, there's an audience.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Good developers are getting fired.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
Sadly, there's an audience for that, too. You know, there are people, plenty of people that will probably buy that game.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
I sold one copy of Hell's Kitchen on the Wii. One.

53:26.000 --> 53:31.000
OK? There's not an audience for that. I mean, unless they're buying it somewhere besides game stores.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
It's terrible. Why are they making all this crap?

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I like cooking and yelling.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
Honestly, the Nintendo Wii, and you heard it here, if you're listening, one of the dozens and dozens of listeners on Orange is on the Radio.

53:42.000 --> 53:49.000
If you're listening, I'm saying it now, the Nintendo Wii is going to cause gaming Armageddon.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
It's the return of the Atari 2600. It's shovelware.

53:53.000 --> 53:59.000
They're putting anything they can on it to try to make a quick buck. Come on, they're making Grey's Anatomy.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
No. That's terrible.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It will probably be better than E.T.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
The Nintendo DS is probably that, too.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
It will probably still be better than E.T.

54:07.000 --> 54:16.000
I don't know. Really, if you played E.T. when that game came out on Atari, it had, like, music, and the character was animated.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
And when you were young and didn't understand, it didn't suck that bad.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
All the people who bang on E.T. now never even played it.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
I did play it. I fell in the hole 50 gazillion times.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Your wife wants to say something bad.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
It's because you suck at video games. Seriously.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
E.T. was not that bad a game.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Yes, Atari was arrogant.

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
Yes, they made more copies than there were 2600s, which is terrible.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Give, give, give.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Dan.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
We get it.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
No, no, no.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I have the story.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Did you even beat E.T.?

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
No, I never did. No one ever has.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
In the existence of mankind.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
There's a YouTube video of someone beating E.T.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
YouTube videos can be fixed, sir.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Whatever.

55:02.000 --> 55:06.000
Yes, when you beat E.T., the real E.T. comes out, and it's actually a good game.

55:06.000 --> 55:12.000
The real E.T. comes out, shakes your hand, and goes to space.

55:12.000 --> 55:18.000
No, I was going to say, E.T.'s a notorious bomb, but that's because Atari produced more copies than there were a dying system.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.000
Well, I mean, they also have, what is it, Prison Break coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Why that game now?

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
And some other examples of really quality stuff on the Wii.

55:30.000 --> 55:36.000
We have a game coming out that's supposed to tie into a Garfield movie that came out two years ago.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
Now coming out on the Wii because it's been delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, and delayed some more.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
We have ghosts.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Oh my god.

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
I seriously think we're about ready to have Armageddon live here in studio.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
There's a storm going on outside.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Weemageddon!

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
That last burst of wind almost blew over the garage door. That's going to be scary.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
This is what we hear outside.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
Whenever you get the little awning piece from the roof, it's like...

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
It'll be live on Justin.TV, too, when we all get blown away.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I will get blown away.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
You're controlling the apocalypse.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
You're all fucked.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Can I read a Turok story?

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Rob, do your story, please.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I'm going to read a Turok story.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
ET is officially banned on Orange Lounge Radio.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
No way. Veto'd.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
I have to say a word that I just heard.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Weemageddon.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
You should copyright the word.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
Copyright? Dude, bad. You should copyright that.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
It's my word! I said Weemageddon.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
The mats are fighting over Weemageddon.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Weemageddon getting out of here.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
You can have Weemageddon.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Go back on the tape, please.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Look, moving on. Turok.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Turokageddon.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
Turok, of course, was reinvented recently on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and all that.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
I didn't play it. Did you play it?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
There's a franchise that needs a comeback.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Oh, wait. No, it didn't.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Apparently some folks agree with you.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Turok 2, rumor is it's been canned.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Before it was even announced.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
Apparently this is because of some layoffs that just happened to Disney.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Again, this is all kind of rumored.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Had nothing to do with the poor sales of the first game.

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
But they say maybe Turok 2 will return to development someday,

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
but a bunch of the core people that were doing it are no longer there.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
But here's the sad thing. Apparently propaganda games that was making this game

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
were also the people that were supposed to be doing the Tron game for the new Tron title.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
So they all might have been sacked.

57:31.000 --> 57:37.000
Better find people to do the Tron game, or I will personally go there with steel-toed boots

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
and kick every last one of them in the nuts.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Here, you want to make some money? I'll tell you how you do it.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
It's very simple, okay?

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
You take the Left 4 Dead concept,

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
Jurassic Park, your surviving dinosaur attacks, and that's it.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
They did that. It sucked.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Actually, that would be pretty awesome.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game.

57:57.000 --> 58:02.000
They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game, and it blew.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
It was scary. No, that was the one on Super Nintendo.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
That scared the shit out of me.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
It was the Sega CD one, but the arcade one blew too.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
No, I'm talking Left 4 Dead with dinosaurs.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
That would be cool. I'm down for that.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
This is the game that they need to make.

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
This is the game that they need to make using the Left 4 Dead engine.

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
They need to do Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
They did comics.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
How about Goats vs. Dogs?

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
How about I do my story?

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
How about I read a chat comment real quick?

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
There's actually some insightful stuff from chat.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
TheRobD actually says something a little bit insightful,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
so I have to go to chat for insightful comments tonight

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
because no one in the studio is saying anything.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
TheRobD says,

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
Is it funny that we take it for granted that a game will have a sequel, isn't it?

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
So we're kind of all new to Rock 2 is going to be coming at some point.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.000
Don't we all kind of take it for granted that sometimes we're going to be getting sequels?

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
Well, because some of these games, regardless of the quality of them,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
they keep putting out sequels.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
For example, Transformers.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
Well, it's because I think if the first one makes any remote amount of money,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
because people aren't willing to do anything original

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
because they want to stick to those franchises that they think are going to sell.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
I mean, thank God we have, you know, Freaky Guy bringing us Noby Noby Boy

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
or else we'd have nothing original.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
And yet they still won't bring us Guardian Legend 2.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I know!

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I'm sorry, Noby Noby Boy isn't that original looking.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
It looks just like Katamari.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
Well, you know the video games industry is doomed

59:35.000 --> 59:38.000
because they made another Turok after Turok Evolution.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
And Turok Evolution, for anyone who played that game, was bad.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
Really, really bad. Not a good game.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
Was it as bad as Superman 64?

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Yeah.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
And then they went and made Superman Returns, which was not very good either.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
That wasn't a sequel to Superman. I mean, there's a difference between a sequel.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It was a reboot.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah, that's kind of like what Turok, this last Turok was.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And actually, it was the last Turok reboot was Evolution and it was horrible.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And Superman Returns, which was not a bad game if you only paid ten bucks for it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Sixty bucks? No, ten bucks? Yeah.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You know, you could be Superman and you could blow cars around and tear up Metropolis

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
and that actually hurt you.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Okay, here's a better example then.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I did not play Superman 64 expecting Superman 2600

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
where you would fly and then be chased by the kryptonite.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Superman for the 2600 was sweet.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Superman 64 managed to be worse than that.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Because the expectations were higher.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Because the 64 should have had a good game where you flew around and did interesting things.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Loki, go ahead. We got to keep the news moving because we're like an hour into the show.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I think it's my story actually.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Well, Hugh had a quick thought and then we'll move on.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah, so I was going to say Activision, Neil, the purveyor of fine games,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000
decided that Pimp My Ride the game was so awesome that they're going to put out Pimp My Ride street racing.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yes, Pimp My Ride the game. Awful, awful, awful.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I hate to say it, I have to talk people out of buying Pimp My Ride almost every day.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Alright, let's move on to some release dates, try to keep things moving forward here.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
We're going to start off in the UK, Dark Sakura, what's coming to the UK?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
For our UK listeners, on the 10th is Tomb Raider Underworld Beneath the Ashes on Xbox 360.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
On the 12th is Flower for Playstation 3 which I really don't know anything about.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It's like flow but with flowers.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
That sounds kind of cool.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Also on the 13th we have Bomberman 2 on DS, yay Bomberman.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Deadly Creatures on Wii, Eternal Sonata on Playstation 3,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Fear 2 Project Origin on PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Kings Bounty the Legend on PC, Last King of Africa on DS,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Mushroom Men sounds hallucinogenic, that's for PC,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Shell Shock 2, Trails on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Star Ocean the Second Evolution on PSP,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and The House of the Dead Overkill on Wii because you can't kill enough zombies.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Alright, very cool.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
In the US there is actually quite a bit coming out as well.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Fear 2 Project Origin on both PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
X-Blades coming out on PC, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Deadly Creatures coming out on the Wii.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Let's see, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
You love remakes, this shit looks hot.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
This game they're doing there, they're gonna be upgrading them all to 720.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Sadly they won't be widescreen.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
But supposedly some classic arcade games are locked away too.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Congo Bongo is in there right here.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
We did it all that last Genesis Collection.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It's like you play so many games and you unlock the arcade version of Altered Beast.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
This Genesis Collection looks really awesome.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It's like 40 games, some really good stuff.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
40 games for 30 bucks.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Well, and they're Genesis games.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Genesis is the superior 16-bit system, so obviously you don't see a lot of Super Nintendo collections.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I have to say, I'm sometimes not a big fan of these remakes and stuff,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
but this looks pretty hot.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
This isn't even really a remake, it's just a collection.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's a repackaging.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Well sure, but I mean a remake is, you know, they make it three years.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Loco Roco 2 on PSP.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Then on the Wii and the Xbox 360 we have Oni Chambara Bikini Zombie Slayer.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Yes!

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And on Xbox 360 Oni Chambara Bikini Samurai Squad.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Have you seen the cover art for that game?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
This game is so epic that they made a movie for it in Japan.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
A theatrical movie.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I'm going to be so broke this week.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I'll bring you some cover art. It's fantastic.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Let's see here.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Then we've also got some other crap that no one cares about.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Jake Power Fireman for the little kids.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000
NASCAR Kart Racing because, you know, the Wii doesn't need a true NASCAR game.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
That would be insulting to its audience.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
My do-it-all for the DS, which is like a PDA device.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Retro Game Challenge, which is a collection of a bunch of fake 8-bit games.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
That's kind of neat.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
House of the Dead Overkill, which will be truly epic.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Mass Effect is getting re-released as a two-disc edition.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
They're going to have the download content in it as well.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And it's going to be $19.99, so that's pretty sweet.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And let's see here.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And that's actually it.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
What's kind of interesting, though, is also this week...

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Is this Street Fighter IV this week?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
No.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
No, that's next week.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Aw, dammit!

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Ha ha!

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Blame.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Anyways, also, actually technically still this week,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon, I believe, will be coming out next...

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
16th?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Actually, well, no, never mind, that's supposed to be Tuesday, so that's next week.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
That game's going to be great.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
And then I think Lost in the Damned this week,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
or Lost in the Damned for Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So that is what I'm really looking forward to.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Man, I thought Street Fighter IV was this week.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
No, it's next week.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
What are you still thinking, Rob?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Blame.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Well, guess what?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
They get in Japan this week.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Street Fighter IV on February 12th, coming to Japan.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Well, hopefully it's region-free.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
And has English options, because I can't read Japanese, sadly.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It's Street Fighter.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Yeah.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Well, I know, I know.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But then I don't get those awesome endings.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I'm just hoping that the US one has the option to turn off the dub soundtrack.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I think I heard it does.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Good.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
PlayStation 3, you also get Street Fighter IV in Japan,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
but you also get Skate 2 gets a release in Japan on the 12th of February,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
because games come out on Fridays over there, I believe.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Mobile Suit Gundam.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Another one of those games from Bandai Namco.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
This one's called Giren no Yabu Access no Kyui 5.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So yet another Gundam game.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
On the DS, it doesn't look like there's actually a lot of stuff coming out.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000
There's a game called Hitamari Sketch, Doko Demo Sugoruku X365.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And I have no idea.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
I'm trying to look at screen caps for this game.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Just saying it is fun.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Yeah, I know, just saying it is fun.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
It looks like it's another minigame collection on the DS,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
made up of little WarioWare-ish minigames,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
kind of what it looks like to me.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I guess that could be cute.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
But they're all cute little Japanese schoolgirls on there.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And on the Sony PSP this week, not a whole lot,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
but you do have Tenchu 4 looks to be a pretty big release

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
coming out over there this week,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
as well as a port of the Gundam game that's on PS2 this week.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Otherwise, a pretty quiet week in Japan,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
probably because of Street Fighter IV pretty much dominating.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So there you go.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
There's your release dates for Japan.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So let's get back and do some more gaming news.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Well, we have our Virtual Fighter.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Virtual Console UK news coming out,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
actually should already be out as of Friday,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
is Clay Fighter, which is on there for 800 Wii points,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the equivalent of six pounds or eight euros.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And the other game that's on there is Sonic Chaos,

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000
which was a Master System game and is 500 Wii points.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So it was actually the first Sonic game that had Tails playable.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
There you go.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Is Clay Fighter on the US Virtual Console?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
If you can pull that down, that game is great.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I stopped following Virtual Console a while ago.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I don't know if we ever got Secret of Mana.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Secret of Mana is supposed to be on the UK one, I thought.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Jeez, I don't think we got that here yet.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Seriously though, Clay Fighter, you can be a Clay Elvis fighting a Clay-like Norse Valkyrie chick.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Helga.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Fighting a blob.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Clay Fighter.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Clay Fighter.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Come on, fight them if you dare.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Clay Fighter, great.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
There was a viral video making this round this week

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
that supposedly was a leaked Dead Rising 2 trailer.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And we know all about leaked trailers

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
that they sometimes tend to be not leaked by someone stealing it,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
but they're leaked on purpose.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
This was shot off of a screen, apparently, off a TV.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And it showed what looks to be a teaser trailer.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Basically, it looks almost like an overrun Las Vegas-type area with casinos.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:09.000
One seemed to show someone in a giant American Gladiators hamster ball thing rolling over zombies.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
So, to be honest, I think it's actually authentic.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And I think it is purposely released by Capcom

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
because the audio in it, if you notice, is actually a direct feed from the trailers.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
So, it's not just shot off a TV audio.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Any idea if we're going to get some multiplayer co-op in this?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Because that's what Dead Rising needed.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It was a great game, but man, if it had, sort of like Left 4 Dead,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
multiple players in the Dead Rising kind of gameplay against millions of zombies.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Oh, dude.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah, no idea what it is exactly, but I know at the very end of the trailer

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
it actually flashes the number 2 really quick.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And there's also another scene that you see Frank Wesson in the Mega Man outfit again.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
I've been in a war.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Can I say, though, that Capcom has a really good pulse on where we want to kill zombies?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Because when I saw this trailer and saw that the next one is in Vegas or whatever,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I was like, that's awesome.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000
No doubt.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Just like when I saw the first one, it was killing zombies in a mall. That's awesome.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
There's one company that knows killing zombies, that knows slaying the undead. It's Capcom.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Let me put it this way. If this is fake, it's an amazing fake.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Yeah.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And maybe Capcom should do this if this is a fake.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
For real.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
But I will be willing to bet that you'll see this at E3.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Easy.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Start the buzz now.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
What better way to get people talking about it than put out a trailer that's supposedly stolen, you know?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Make a demo for E3 of E3 infested with zombies.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
That actually would be pretty badass.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And you killing people are zombies.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Or maybe in the reverse, you're a zombie and you're killing people.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Well, the buzz is also starting on this game. It's Saw.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The game.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
You know, this is weird because I heard before that Saw was supposed to be coming out.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
It was in development and then got cancelled.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Well, apparently now Konami has picked up the rights to do Saw.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I guess Brash Entertainment had started this game and stopped it.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And now Konami has actually picked up the rights since that other company closed down.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Variety was the one to actually report this.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
The game is now going to be developed by Zombie Studios.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And it's supposed to come out right when the sixth Saw movie comes out this Halloween.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And I'm like, they really are on Saw 6?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It doesn't seem like something you can adapt into a game at all.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I mean, it just doesn't work for me.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I don't see how you're going to be able to do it.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
You know what?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
To the dismay of fans of it in the room, I can foresee this.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
If Konami makes Saw and it's a hit, it will kill Silent Hill.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Oh, I know. That's the sad thing.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And, you know, because I'm thinking in my head, I'm like, well, okay.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But wait a minute. Konami's done Silent Hill.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Granted, these are two completely different developers.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I've never really heard of this Zombie Studios before.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
They have nothing to do with Silent Hill.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
But I'm like, well, okay.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Silent Hill is actually a pretty rad game.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So, like, if they made Saw, like, kind of like a game like that.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
But I'm like, I just don't see Saw being a game like that.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I don't think it's going to work.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I think it's just going to be gross killing.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And it's sad. I don't think Homecoming did well.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
They're doing everything they can to stem the tie.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
They tried to action up Homecoming.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
They tried to do the remake, the Origins one.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
And, you know, that's all Konami needs.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
If they come up with another horror franchise,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
they'll probably put Silent Hill out to pasture.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Yeah, I don't know how well Homecoming did.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
But I'm worried that there may not be a sixth one.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So, I hope you're wrong.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
But sadly, you might be right.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
So, don't buy the Saw game.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Lee M'Geddon.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
But honestly, though, I mean,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I don't see how they're going to be able to do it.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
It's just, it's not...

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Saw isn't a franchise that's really action-packed or anything.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And, I mean, it's...

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Neither is Silent Hill.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Well, Silent Hill is easy...

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
They'll just do the same thing, except for you'll be dodging, like,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
traps made by the Saw guy.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And, you know, every once in a while you get yourself into some sort of weird ethical dilemma

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
where you have to kill somebody.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
And honestly, it sounds like they might be able to make a pretty cool game out of it.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I'd buy it.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
We'll see. We'll check it out at E3.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Just to kill Silent Hill.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Jamie, you express a lot of dish pleasure at the news of a Saw game.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Are you excited about it?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I will stab you in the face.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Oh, it might be...

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
If you buy the Saw game.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Saw in real life.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
No, because, first of all,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
the concept of Saw is, well, retarded.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Sorry!

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
And not very interesting.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And how can you...

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I guess, you know, if Nightmare on Elm Street did...

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
You know, this is, I guess, our Nightmare on Elm Street for the modern age, except,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
you know, Freddy Krueger was funny.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
But...

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And the fact that they're now rebooting Friday the 13th, right?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
There's that new movie coming out.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
But Jared Padalecki's in it.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And, uh...

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And it does look cool.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
The, uh, Nightmare on Elm Street, they're also doing without Robert Englund.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Which will not work.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You can't...

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But Robert Englund in there, he's not doing anything.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I mean, seriously, who's here?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
He's slowly dying. That's why they can't put him in it.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It doesn't matter!

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
He's old!

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
He's dying of old!

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Anyway...

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
My point is, is that, you know,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Saw is a gimmick.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Silent Hill, you know, basically,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
a lot of thought went into the psychology of the game.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And it created its own sort of mythology around what made that universe work.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
You know what I mean?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Yeah, in other words, Pyramid Head is not a gimmick.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
He's a fucking rock star.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
They should stop putting him in every single game.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
But my point is that...

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I mean, sure, if you want mindless bullshit in a game,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
get Saw. Go for it.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Buy mindless bullshit.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
If you want a game that's gonna make you, you know, think a little bit

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
and actually use your brain...

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And possibly pee your pants.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And possibly pee your pants, yes.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Go for Silent Hill.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Besides that Silent Hill 2, Chainsaw.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Perfect.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Silent Hill of Superior.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
We're like an hour fifteen into this show.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
We're not even close to the end of a...

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
This is why Dan comes once every five years.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Dan's funny.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
If you didn't want to hear from me, you wouldn't have invited me.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
We like Dan. We like Dan. He's funny.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I invited my sweetie here and cuddled with him and said,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Come be on the show.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
He goes, okay, and then lost his phone.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Anyway.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
So the...

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
We gotta go to Jamie for our next story.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize she hadn't done the other story yet.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Anyway, anyway, anyway.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Guess what we were speaking earlier about series getting a reboot.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
So guess what's next in line?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Splatterhouse.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Which totally makes sense with Friday the 13th getting its reboot

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
because then you've got Dude in a Hockey Mask.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And freaking Splatterhouse is awesome.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I love the picture on the little article because I was the guy with the chainsaw hands.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Anyway.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And as we all know, the game is actually out on Virtual Console right now.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
But they're talking later this year.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Namco Bondi is planning Quarter 3 for doing a new Splatterhouse game.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And there actually is an official site up.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
If you go to splatterhousegame.com,

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000
you can see some of the images from the game.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And you can actually now...

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000
This is the first game that lets you use your own severed limbs as a weapon.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Yeah, your arms and stuff and your skin will get ripped off as you're playing the game

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
or as you're getting damage done to you.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
And your limbs will grow back and you can actually beat people with your limbs.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
This won't be rated M or anything.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
There's a lot of controversy about this because apparently Namco just whacked the dev team for this game.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Which was a California-based developer.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I don't know if they handed it to another team or if the game is going to be back or in limbo.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I heard the Afro Samurai people might be able to take it.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Or the arm of the developer got cut off and given to the other team to use in developing the game.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
This news, though, is coming right out of New York Comic-Con which was going on this weekend.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Right, so it's interesting that we hear the dev team get sacked,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
yet they're showing it at New York Comic-Con going on this weekend.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Which is crazy, so it's interesting.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Oh, that's the corporate world.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Fast-paced, ever-changing world of video game development.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Exactly, but that's okay because in Splatterhouse they'll grow the limbs back.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's alright.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Anyhow, a couple more stories and we'll get to the classic game of the week in a break.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Alright, well there is a brand new update that they did to fix the HDMI audio issues that they were having with the HDMI audio cable for the 360.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
However, as with most updates, it seems, there are some problems.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And apparently a lot of people are reporting that after this update was downloaded to their Xbox 360 system,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:07.000
that they received the brand new present of an E74 error message, which is one of the one red light problem.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:13.000
And it's funny because that also happens to be not covered by their warranty.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:18.000
D'oh! And sad trombone.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
And so, yeah, a lot of people are pissed off at that.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000
You mean Microsoft developed a game console with a problem.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
No! No!

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I've taken back six Xboxes in the last week.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Was it all because of this update?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
No, those things just break.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
They don't have to update them to break.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Microsoft don't even worry about updating them. They're just going to break!

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
You look at them funny and they'll break.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Seriously?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It's like the Xbox has feelings.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
You look at me funny and I'm going to shut down.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You used me to do all your gaming and bought stuff for me!

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I just want to cuddle!

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Oh, but you know, I love when they ask you on the phone, was it plugged into a search protector?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Oh yes, it was the search protector's fault that my console broke.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Alright, look, we got a segment we don't do on the show very often,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
but when we do it, it's just because there's such stupidity that goes on out there in the world

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
that sometimes video games get a bad name.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
That's why we have to give out a stupid award.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
This week's stupid award goes to Daniel Alvarez.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
He lives in Austin, Texas.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Why does he get the stupid award?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Because he got arrested on charges of assault.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Because what he did, he assaulted his girlfriend with a Wii controller.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Also, and possibly the even more hideous crime as reported,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
he's also suspected of eating her cookies.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
He seriously jumped up behind her with the nunchuck strap and like super spider with it.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Yes.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Like it's like a Rottwein.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Wait, I'm not done. I'm not done.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Look, like this is one of those things.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Look, we got this report off of Kotaku, and this is like one of those things that's so stupid,

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I'm not wondering if they just made the damn thing up.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Like, seriously?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I'm looking at this. No, listen to this.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Apparently, Christina Alvarado, who is the girlfriend,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
what happened is that she actually told the police that she was attacked by her boyfriend,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:43.000
and the thing was, she was pissed off at him because he ate her Girl Scout cookies.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And he was pissed off because he got woke up to get yelled at about the Girl Scout cookies.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
So I guess to teach her a lesson, he choked her with a Wii controller.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Don't you dare. Ever.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Because I wake him up all the time for eating my stuff out of the fridge.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I was going to kill you. It would not be with a Wii controller.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Well, the unofficial city motto of Austin is keep Austin weird.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
That's frickin' weird right there.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So I might go ahead and lean on that one to be true.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And FYI, it does not appear to be made up.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
They've linked to a source here that apparently says, yes,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
an Austin man has been accused of trying to choke his girlfriend with a cord of a Wii video game controller

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
after she became angry that he had eaten all of her Girl Scout cookies.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
You know what the gag is, though?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
For the people who don't know about the way that the nunchuck works

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:41.000
is that all Wii controllers are cordless.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I bet that damage that any cords would not be covered under the warranty.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I wonder if that's what the defense attorney will try to say.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000
All she would have to do is yank hard and unplug it.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
If you have the other hand on the remote, the other hand on the nunchuck.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I want to know what type of cookies they were

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
because if they were Samoas, I kind of understand.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
They're not Samoas anymore, Rob.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
No, they are always Samoas. I don't give a shit what they're calling them on the box.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I agree. And Thin Mints.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Caramel sucks a lot.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I need to know one thing.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Yes.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Was he wearing the wrist strap?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000
No, no. Even better, even better, did it have the condom on?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
See, the mats think alike here.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I was going to say the exact same thing before Loki took the mic away.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
So, yes, we need to know if it had the Wii condom on and the safety strap.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Because if it didn't have the safety strap on, Nintendo would have...

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
They're not dealing with that.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Isn't it even funnier if somehow during this whole struggle of him strangling her

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
that somehow the remote flew into the TV?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
You guys are sick, sick people.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And it pains me to be associated.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
They fought over fucking cookies.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
They kind of...

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Did you think that was serious?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
At least there were no tacos thrown.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
People have been trying to kill each other with game controllers for years.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I don't know if you know this.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
It dates back to the 2600 days.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Back when we had the NES advantage, I could see someone getting killed with an NES advantage.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000
He's got a scar on his back in the shape of a ColecoVision controller.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Then there was this one time that I woke up and Jamie was just stuffing a power pad down onto my face.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
She's been trying to kill me with a game controller.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Now she knows. Use a Wii remote. I'm dead.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
You fuckers have killed me.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room has a great idea for a new video game.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Cookie Guy versus Taco Kid.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Dark Knight asks, does Miyamoto have to choke a bitch?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Oh boy.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
We need to get to the classic game of the week and take a break and try to find our souls.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
So every week here on Orange Lawn's radio,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
DarkSakura likes to dig through the archive of great gaming

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
and find a video game she believes all of you should be playing.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It's our classic video game of the week.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
DarkSakura, which should the kids be playing this week?

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
GORF.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Bless you.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Well, I didn't throw up yet.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
GORF.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
GORF stands for Galactic Orbiting Robot Force.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.000
It's a very bizarre little game because it's like a version of three games in one.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Basically, your first level, you've got different missions.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So going through different missions will set up your rank.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Anyway, I guess what you're hearing, it's just about shooting.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It's basically Space Invaders. The first stage of GORF is Space Invaders.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000
The first level is Space Invaders with a big circular shield that you kind of have to shoot through.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Yeah, the second level is, well, like my husband was saying, behind the scenes,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
is like Galaga where you have to shoot the little planes that shoot down.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
It had the crappiest collision detection ever.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
It wouldn't even shoot you and you'd explode.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Stupid game.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:14.000
And then the last level was another, well, at least in the arcade version,

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000
you had the Galaxian-type level and you had a space warp-type level after that,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:29.000
which was the gyrus-like level where it's sort of a weird perspective as if you're going into the warp.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
All kind of tempest-y, but not quite, as far as the perspective.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And then the last one is the flagship one where actually you're going and shooting the alien ship

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and it has a shield around it, like a semi-circular shield, so you have to shoot through it.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And the game was actually supposed to be a tie-in with Star Trek The Motion Picture,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
but it didn't fit in with the script, so they said no.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So they put all these great 80s space games in a blender and out comes GORF.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Pretty much. On top of that, it was actually saying here that it used the Votrax speech synthesis chip in the arcade version,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
so it had the robot voice in it too. It was pretty cool.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I only played this in the arcade a couple times. I had this on the Colecovision,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
which to me is just the best version of GORF ever.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I love the little music place.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:30.000
But it's also saying that the GORF hardware actually was compatible,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
and you could switch it out for other games like Wizard of War.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I'm going to do something here with the music.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I'm going to switch to the Commodore 64 version just because I love Commodore 64

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
and I see that there's one here on this.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
But GORF was out on like a million different systems, it seems. Right?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Yeah, it was out on quite a few.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I think I played this on Commodore 64. This looks familiar to me.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I remember the circular shield and all that stuff. Good times.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
But basically though, as you go through the levels and get to the end of it,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
and I've gotten to the end of it on the Colecovision,

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:19.000
you get space cadet, space captain, space colonel, space general, space warrior, and space avenger.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
There was a sequel planned called Ms. GORF. Yeah, I know.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Does Ms. GORF have a bow in her hair? Is that what differentiates her from GORF?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I don't know.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It was actually, I think it was programmed in fourth language.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Is that like fourth meal at Taco Bell?

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Well, the programmer of GORF owns the source code

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
and it apparently only exists in a set of eight inch floppy disks.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
There were versions on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Colecovision,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
the Atari 8-bit BBC Micro, Commodore 64, VIC-20, and 1982.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.000
The Galaxian mission was removed from all home ports.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000
It was given an Atari Jaguar port just by some guy.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
You know, did it as a hobby.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
And it was taken off of the market because he didn't go for any of the copyrights.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
So, bastard.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I'm bored. I think I want to remake GORF.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I know, right?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Also, the current world record for GORF, recognized by Twin Galaxies.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And the...

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Hey, I watch King of Kong.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
I actually realized a giant fart was enough to make the high scoreboard on GORF.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Here, let me make the scoreboard right now.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
As Rob puts the microphone towards his crotch.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Anyway, he also made the Guinness Book of World Records

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:01.000
by a guy named Todd Rogers on November 24th, 1982 at Haunted Trails in Burbank, Illinois.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
He is?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Oh, apparently he's in the King of Kong.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
And my husband says he looks like Ron Jeremy.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Kind of.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
With the Rob D's in chat going, I hate Todd Rogers.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I know it's Todd Rogers. I hate him.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
But the high score was 653,990.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I want someone to break it.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
That would involve playing GORF.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
GORF is fun.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I am putting out a personal challenge to someone to break Todd Rogers' score on GORF.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000
653,990.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
GORF backwards is frog.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
It would actually be pretty awesome if you could break it with a score of 666,000.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:54.000
If someone, whoever manages to break that will get a no prize from me,

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
will be interviewed on Orange Town's radio,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000
and will win a shiny penny.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
You also get it in the Guinness Book of World Records, though.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
You might.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Alright, look.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Enough GORF.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Frog.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
No, good choice.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
It's definitely a game I think a lot of people have not heard of or forgot about.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So bringing GORF back to the spotlight, and hopefully that old record can be shattered.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
How about a little anecdote regarding me picking that game?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Sure.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I was actually trying to think of a good epic RPG, and I was like, ah, fuck it, GORF.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Whatever works for you.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Whatever works.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
It just stuck in my head.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Alright.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Anyhow, we're going to take a break while Dan and Jamie get into an argument.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
We're going to take a break.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Everything she knows about classic video games she stole from me.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And then she flipped me off.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Right on the air.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
We're going to take a break, you guys.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
We'll be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
We have more to come in Part B tonight.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
We're going to talk about Indiana Jones and a great Indiana Jones game that might be making

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000
a comeback.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
We're going to finally talk about iPhone gaming, which I promised Dan we could do earlier.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And a new project from Rockstar Games, which I'm sure has Loki pretty excited.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
We'll be talking about all of that in Part B right after this.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Stay tuned, guys, with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Welcome, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:21.000
8th of 2009, where we are doing the 312th episode of our show, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
We always tape live Sunday nights at AllGames.com.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Of course, if you were listening live tonight, there was a little bit of mad stuff going

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
on during the break.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
We've kind of been joking throughout the evening.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
There's a lot of wind and rain type stuff going on outside.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
It seemed to have knocked our network out for a little bit because we dropped during

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
the break.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Our podcast listeners won't notice a thing because they just get that little break in

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
between there.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But we're going to get right back on with the show, so I apologize for running a little

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
late.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
We're going to try and catch up some time here.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
And I know we have folks that want to call in to talk about New York Comic-Con and all

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
that stuff.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
So we're going to try and move a little bit quickly through news in Part B. We'll see.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
I had the small announcement, though.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Oh, yes, you did have a small announcement, Dark Soccer.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I just got this inspiration during the last segment on Part A. I kind of want to do a

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
monthly top score contest on a classic game.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And I know not everyone has different things, so I'll pick different consoles and arcade

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
or whatnot.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000
But I will be putting something up very soon for a high score classic game contest.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And talk to our web guy about that.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Because with the new website and everything, there's now a thing where you can upload pictures

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
directly to our website by sending it this particular email address so people can send

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
their scores.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Maybe we can do a little widget or something with the scores.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
We could probably put something together pretty easy.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It would be fun.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I'm still working on it.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:38.000
But, you know, I used to do the game knowledge quiz back when I had Pump Up the Volume.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And I'd kind of like to do something like that again.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
That'd be fun.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Yeah.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
All right.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Well, anyhow, let's get into some news now.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
And we'll start off with Loki.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
He's bringing us some news on an old classic series, right?

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Yes, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings was the new Indiana Jones game that they announced

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
for the Wii and DS.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
And, you know, it actually looks pretty cool.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I'm glad to see that LucasArts is working on an Indiana Jones game.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
But something that's also pretty cool is they're going to be bringing a special unlockable

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
for the Wii version.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
It will have the adventure game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Sorry.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
You didn't hear that music on the feed.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
My bad.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So, yeah, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis on the Wii version.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Pretty good if you don't have, you know, a SCUMM emulator on there.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Or SCUMM VM.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And this is like one of the all-time classic, you know, click and point games.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
So it's pretty awesome.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Are they not doing that 360 and PS3 one that they announced?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Maybe not right now.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
It might be later on.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Weak.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Well, this is also on the Wii.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
So maybe just, you know, multi-platform?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Everything but, yeah, Wii, PlayStation 2, and PSP.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Because, you know, they can port that crap easy.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
So, I don't know.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.000
There may be another one coming out for the PS3 and 360.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000
They're still working on it, so.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Well, I don't know if you would file this under Wiimageddon or what you'd do,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
but apparently EA, they made a lot of announcements this week

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
because they had a financial call going on this week.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And apparently they are going to be porting Dead Space to the Wii.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
This says, a quote from the call, the CEO John Riccitello says,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000
We're bringing core intellectual properties and franchises

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
in categories we think have legs on the Wii platform.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
A good example of this is Dead Space.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Unfortunately, what you don't know is that it's going to be Dead Space Party.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And it's actually going to be, you know, Party Spinoff

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
because, you know, they couldn't really do an actual legit hardcore game for the Wii.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Well, I don't know.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But the interesting thing about this is that they actually say,

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
and also this from a magazine interview, quote,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Go look at Dead Space and imagine playing that game with a wand and nunchuck.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
If they improved the precision, then you could have a good experience.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Hmm, is it a hint that MotionPlus could be supported by this?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
And imagine that the graphics look slightly worse.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Slightly.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
It's like this.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
If EA pulls this off, and they're a company on the upswing,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I mean, I know that profits are down and they're laying people off,

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000
but creatively, wow, that's a great word,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
you've got to give EA credit.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
They're head and shoulders above where they were last year this time, you know.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
They're coming off of Dead Space, which was amazing.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Mirror's Edge, which was a heck of a game.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Just a bunch of great titles coming out of EA.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
If they pull this off, props.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
I mean, because the Wii needs super cool games,

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
but man, I don't know how you're going to do it without the graphic power

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
because Dead Space is a game where the visuals are just so important.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Well, okay, granted, if Dead Space really is about the graphics,

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
then, you know, whatever, but should games really be about the graphics?

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Not necessarily, right?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Well, maybe, maybe not, but I mean, play Dead Space.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I mean, have you played Dead Space?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
No, because it's first person.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
That game will fuck you up for life.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
I'll check it out, but I just know not yet.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
It's atrocious, and I think so much of the atmosphere in that game

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000
is it's just super, super good visuals.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
But I will say, one of the other games you mentioned,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I'm not usually much of a first person gamer,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
but Mirror's Edge is pretty hot.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000
I think that game is pretty hot.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Yeah, and it's one of those things where it's like if they tried to do that on Wii,

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
and they could do it right and have motion controls and stuff,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
hey, you know, great, more power to you.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
The Wii needs these games, you know, even if it's not about graphics,

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
which it's not about graphics, if they could bring this game

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
in a meaningful way to the other system, to the Wii,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
it would validate the Wii's existence

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
because there are too many minigame collections.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
And don't get me wrong, I know for the Wii's mainstream target audience,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
that's, I guess, what sells.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
But, you know, they need it.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Again, if you're just joining us live tonight here on All Games Radio,

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I just want to point out that's Dan, Jamie's husband,

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
often talked about on the show but rarely heard from.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
But he's here tonight and telling it like it is from his experience

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
in working in game stores for many years.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Well, in other gaming news, especially in iPhone gaming news,

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
which, you know, as a person who has an iPhone

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000
and actually plays the games on it,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I still don't know what I think about having this one on there

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
because it just seems like it would be cheaply easy.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000
But Time Crisis is supposed to be coming on to the Apple App Store,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
actually already on there, where you can play with the finger of death.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Instead of shooting the guys on the screen, you tap them,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
so I guess it's like punching them in the face with a gun.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And the way that you dodge is by tilting the iPhone to do your dodge move,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
which I suppose is also reload.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So you can now poke people to death.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Very interesting, though, at this rise of, you know,

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
console gaming franchise classics coming on to iPhone.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
And I don't know if it's just because it's kind of like all Namco and Konami,

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
but, you know, just within the past, like just within 2009,

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
we've had news of Katamari, Time Crisis, Silent Hill, Metal Gear,

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
DDR, all having, yeah, there's a Silent Hill iPhone game now.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Oh, you weren't here last week.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I have it, if you want to check it out before you buy it and spend $7 on it.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
But there's, yeah, Silent Hill iPhone game now.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Don't do it.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
It's not fog, it's not fog adventure Silent Hill.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
It's like a dungeon explorer type thing, so just, you know, try before you buy.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000
That's what I'm saying.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
But, yeah, there's a Silent Hill game on iPhone now.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
It's crazy.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
So it's just interesting, this whole, you know, barrage of stuff we're getting.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I don't think the Metal Gear Solid game's out yet, but we know it's coming.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
It is in the works, at least.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Oh, geez.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Metal Gear.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
It's just interesting, I suppose.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Well, you know, I was going to say another game we didn't talk about

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
because it wasn't our show role, but Rolando.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I don't know if you remember that game.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Oh, yeah.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
That's a great game.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
They're doing a sequel to that, actually, on there.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
And they have, I think, they're doing a free version, you know,

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
like a trial version or something like that.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
So that's going to be available now, but, I mean, that's a pretty cool game.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
I completely forgot to mention this during my gaming week

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
because I sometimes forget that my iPhone has become a way for me to do gaming,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.000
but Aurora Faint 2, the arena, I checked out and downloaded a solid,

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
solid fucking game.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Who made Rolando?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
That I don't know.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
No idea.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Aurora Faint is a hell of a puzzle game that I'm enjoying on an iPhone.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.000
It's LocoRoco.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Yeah.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
It's great.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
It is LocoRoco.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
That's crazy.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000
But one thing that you won't find anymore on the iPhone app store

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
is the iPhone Duck Hunt game.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Yes, the Nintendo lawyers have finally swooped in like a duck

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
and plucked the game off the...

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Anything about the game in Watch?

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And then the dog rose out of the bushes and laughed at him.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
You know the Nintendo lawyer, after he laid the smack down on that stupid little company,

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
did the Nintendo duck laugh.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
What about the Game & Watch games, though, that were on there?

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I don't know.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Those may still be on there.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I downloaded a couple of them.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Yeah, I downloaded the one that was free, but I didn't download any of the others.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Reggie's going to show up at your house and personally lead them off your iPhone.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
He's going to Falcon Punch us with his cock.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Show me your move.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I did want to give a quick shout-out real quickly,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
because we were talking about iPhone games and Namco and all their franchises.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Not on the iPhone, but on the PlayStation 3.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
I believe a Namco collection is being released or has just recently been released,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
and I hear it's pretty cool, and you want to check it out.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
The Namco Museum on PS3.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I think it's only in the Japanese store.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Remember, because they were tying those in also,

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
you can get like t-shirts and shit for home.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I think it's going to be on its way here pretty soon.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I hear you want to check it out.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I didn't come out for the 360 like last Christmas.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Well, they had the Namco. It was a Namco arcade something for the 360.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
They had like a bunch of the Xbox Live Arcade games,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
and then they had some other classic games and remade stuff,

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
and that was supposed to be pretty good, and I think it's probably pretty cheap now.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Yeah, it had some live. It was like 30 bucks, and it had like 30 games or so.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I mean, it was this really weird thing because it had games you could play off the disk,

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.000
then it had games you had to import on your hard drive and play as like live arcade games.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
You know, and it had like a lot of stuff you might have already downloaded.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000
It had like Pac-Man Tournament Edition and stuff like that, or Championship Edition.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Yeah, it looked like a great collection. Really cool stuff.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I was really surprised they did it because I figured they'd just keep, you know,

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
shelling them out to us 10 bucks at a time over the network.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
All right, well, we're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com with your emails,

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
but I have one more story about iPhone gaming,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
and this ties in kind of exactly what you were saying a little bit ago,

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and this is iPhone is growing and growing and starting to become mobile gaming.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.000
In fact, right now, they are saying that iPhones are accounting for 14% of mobile game downloaders,

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
and that was in the month of November. 32.4%.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000
That's like a third of all iPhone users say that they have downloaded a game.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
In the month of November, they downloaded some type of game.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Just to put that in perspective, across most mobile phone companies, you're looking at 3.8%.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.000
So, you're talking like 10 times as many people on the iPhone check out games.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Is that because the iPhone gives you?

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Go back a year on this show.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Just go back one year on this show before iPhone apps started coming out.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Mobile phone gaming was kind of the butt of many jokes on this show.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
But in other countries, mobile gaming has been just fantastic,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000
but we haven't had a phone until the iPhone or the Trio or the ones like that came out

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000
that was capable of handling an actual game with solid gameplay.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
And let me say this to the chatters.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
chat.orangelandradio.com, we always look at that here on Sunday Nights.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Catacos in the chat room says, well, let's get serious.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
What other phone can play games on them that are that good?

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Might I mention the N-Gage?

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
No, good. That are good.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
The iPhone, you know, it amounts to like 3%, 30%, whatever, of games downloaded,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.000
but it amounts to 100% of the decent phone games to download.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
I will say this, that I did have a couple of cool games on my old phone.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
It was intensely hard to play, but I did have Super Pac-Man.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Once in a while, there were even, as hard of a time as we gave them in the past,

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000
there were, like, the Luminous one that they had on phones was pretty frickin' good for a phone game.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000
And the Doom RPG and stuff, they had some pretty intricate stuff even on the old-ass phones.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I did play Bejeweled on my old phone.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.000
So, you know, but most of it was a joke because it was cashing in on the SpongeBob, you know, and all that crap.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
You know, they were just crappy little games.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Spikaru says, I have an N-Gage and does NES and Mega Drive emulation pretty well.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
That's the only thing it's good for.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I guess that would be a reason to have it.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Tony Hawk on N-Gage was not that bad.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
All right. Let's get to the mailbag here, guys.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have questions for us.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Every week you guys send in your e-mails and we like to open up the mailbag and read through them.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
And Dark Soccer's going to do it right now.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Do we actually get some e-mails this week?

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Yes, we did.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
All right.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
We had a poor showing last week, so I'm glad people listened.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Rob with Two Bees says there's new box art on Neo GAF.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
What's Neo GAF? G-A-F?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Neo games are fun.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yeah, these huge forums that, you know, tons and tons of people look at.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Okay, I just haven't been there before.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Probably because there's like a million different gaming forums on the internet.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Supposedly the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame is being ported to PS3, Xbox 360.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Yes, it is.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
He says I actually bought this for PSP, Wii, and PS2.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I'm curious to see the graphics.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I'm curious to see if they add some more tables.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
The Wii, you know what?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Oh, God! Fun House is on the freaking cover. I hate that game.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Call Wii Mageddon as much as you want, but that Wii game was pretty awesome.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
The pinballs. Dan's giving his thumbs up of approval.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Yeah, that was a pretty awesome collection of games, I gotta say.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.000
If you like pinball, you have a 360, download Pinball FX.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
It's awesome.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
But Pinball Hall of Fame is great.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
If they go crazy, add some new tables for the 360 PS3 versions, that'll be awesome.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
It's actually a really good pinball collection, really good physics.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:31.000
And honestly enough, my vote's for the Wii version because of the nunchucks for remote control.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Um, our next one, um, comes from GeekBoy2424.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Hi guys, I have come to a conclusion. I have ADHD.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Along with a little bit of OCD.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:52.000
My question for the week is, how do you guys stop yourselves because the only thing that works for me is playing games?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Uh, when is, okay, I guess when I sit at my desk I can't concentrate because I can't sit freaking still.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Help Dr. Orange Lounge. Sincerely, GeekBoy2424.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Okay, well if you seriously think you might have some type of, like, you know, attention deficit disorder, you might want to see a doctor.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.000
You know, as much as, you know, it strokes our gaming egos that you would email the show to talk about this,

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
you really, really need to see a doctor if you think you actually have symptoms.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Like, I don't know if this is a joke, because I joke a lot of times on the show that I have gaming ADHD

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
because I play a game for five minutes, then go, ooh, something shiny!

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
And go play something else. Like, it happens all the time.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
But if, like, you're for real real, like, you have to play video games to get around your ADD that you think you have,

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
you might want to see a doctor. I'm just saying, we can't diagnose that.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
And that's a huge liability if we even tried to.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Now that Rob has said something responsible, I say self-medicate.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Play games all the time. Just, it's not going to kill you or anything. Just play them.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
When you're at your desk, what about your Game Boy?

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
You know, if it calms you down and it makes you feel good, it's not like you're doing drugs or something, hook it up, man.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Just remember to go to the bathroom once in a while.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:05.000
When I was a young, hyperactive child, they used to make me drink coffee to calm down.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Because caffeine and, excuse me, caffeine, when you're already wired up and hyper, actually can be a sedative.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:20.000
What? I'm not giving medical advice. I'm just saying what I used to do.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I'm just saying coffee's delicious.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
That's not medical advice, by the way. That's just what I used to do.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Liability, liability, liability. No, I understand.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Anyway, but you know what? ADD is in your head.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
I'm kidding.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Next email.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Hi, OLR. I'm sending this message from my iPod Touch with a cracked screen because my smart self dropped it on the ground while going from a friend's house to mine.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Anyway, I came to say hi because I've been listening to the podcast lately and laughed about the kid that threw a taco at his mom.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
By P.S.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Oh, he didn't put any spaces or anything.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:14.000
This message came from your friendly neighborhood MySpace friend, Eroka7, sent from my iPod.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
The end.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Can I interrupt? I got some kind of sad news I want to read.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I just was informed of this by a chatter who linked me to an article on Bamani style that was posted earlier today.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Jason Michael Bornstein, who is kind of known more out there as Stillwind in his name, passed away on Saturday night.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:45.000
He was a big part of the team at Konami of Hawaii, and he was the audio director of the Xbox series.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And part of the reason why I'm stopping the whole show to mention this and just kind of take a minute to kind of soak this all in is that

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I don't know if you guys remember back when we would do the podcast and the show itself, the radio show itself, as separate shows,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000
but one year we had a big, big score that we had the universe soundtrack.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.000
We premiered those songs here on Orange Lawn's radio, and I think it was like UltraMix 4 at the time before anybody else got to hear them.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.000
That was Stillwind who coordinated all that with us here over email and was a big part, I know, of the fan community as well.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:29.000
So I'm just kind of, it does not, I'm just kind of shocked and saddened to hear it, and I'm sorry to depress everybody with this news,

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000
but I'm just finding it out myself, and this is sometimes the problems that you have when you do a live radio show is that you get live news.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I don't know, you know, Babani Style is a pretty respectable site. I don't see why they would lie about something like this, and just no.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:54.000
That would be very poor taste. So I'm pretty sure this is legit and very sad, and I don't know what else to say.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I'm very sorry to hear this for his family and everybody and for the community that will have really lost something with this.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
That's really sad news.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
So I'm very sorry to derail the mailbag with that sad news.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
He died from a ruptured aorta.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Oh, that is very sad.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Okay, but he did a lot for the show a couple years ago and did keep in touch a little while here and there, so I just wanted to pass that news along.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Sorry, please tell me the next email has like a dick and fart joke or something to bring the humor back to the show, because I really just killed it right there.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Well, hi folks. I just thought I'd throw in my proverbial two cents regarding the subject of rampant fanboyism that is often seen quite a lot on the net.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Personally, I think that no matter what systems one promotes or trashes fanboyism in any form just makes us gamers look like the mouth-breathing Cheetos dust encrusted inbred Neanderthals that non-gamers perceive us, and quite frankly, this kind of thing really needs to stop.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Big, long sentence. Wow.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Speaking as someone who has both the 360 and PS3, and a whole shit-ton of other systems from previous generations, I can honestly say the following.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
There's no such thing as a perfect system.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Either there's a flaw in the hardware itself, or there's a feature service, or some other aspect that another system does better.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Additionally, just because a given game isn't on one system of choice, that doesn't mean it's a crap game.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Conversely, just because a game is exclusive to one's favorite system, that doesn't make the game the greatest thing since the invention of breast implants.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Simply put, each system has strengths as well as weaknesses, good games as well as total turds.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000
It helps to have multiple consoles so one has that much more options for gaming.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Amen to that.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Because you know what we always said on the show, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
That sums it up right there. And that's from Spaznator.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Dreamcast, yo.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Dude, Dreamcast is turning 10 this year, can you believe it? I was just thinking about that. That's crazy.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I remember standing in line on September 9th, 1999.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:14.000
It's interesting though that we do have three very distinct consoles that are out there right now, and all of them have decent games on them, and all of them have some pretty crap games on them.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000
So you have two consoles and then you have the Wii.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:23.000
But even the Wii, you know, the Wii's got for it, for a particular audience, it has games people want.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Soccer moms and families, it's got a ton of stuff that people want.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:39.000
But the console war right now, and while it's not a war for first place because Nintendo's got that, the console war, the culture clash in gamers right now is PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Just like last generation, GameCube was there, but it was really Xbox versus PS2.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And, I mean, I've been hitting the gaming forums for a long time, I don't just work in a game store, but I work in a game store because I'm a gamer.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And, you know, the fanboyism is always going to be there.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I own every system, and I mean every system.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
They really do.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
In our defense, we do not own a Jaguar.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
I would if I found one.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
But, hey dude, Tempest 2000 is sweet and aliens versus predators good.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Cybermorph is not too bad.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:25.000
But, back on the subject of fanboyism, I always have my favorites.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:32.000
You know, when it came down to Genesis versus Super Nintendo, I would argue Genesis for hours.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And my wife says Super Nintendo, they're both great, don't get me wrong, Genesis.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
But, quit worrying about it.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
You know, if you go onto a forum and you post about something on the 360, expect someone to say the PS3 is great.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
But, isn't it, and BlackWolf is in chat and makes a great point here.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
And, you know, the executives get into this shit too.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Sony says that the PS3 is a leader because the Wii doesn't exist to them, and they don't consider the 360 reliable.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
So, they say that they win by default.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
They win because they're all, we refuse to acknowledge our competition, therefore we are the victors.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
We win because our system is made by Sony.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
He's also not making that up.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
They're also eating too much periwinkle.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
He's paraphrasing, but he's not making that up, what are you saying?

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And they're also eating too much burnt sienna.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000
We are the number one Sony system on the planet.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000
And that's fine. You know, the company is going to try to brainwash you anyway.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Sadly, no, the PlayStation 2 is.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:32.000
No, that's true. And the PSP. But, pick the system that you like and fight for it.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
What about the PlayStation 1?

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Get on the forums and tell everyone who likes the other system that they are ass clowns.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000
That's right. I want to see more rap and feminism. Be into what you're doing.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Alright, Jamie's dying to read the last email, Jamie.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Dear Lord.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Last email.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
You brought him. You brought him.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
I know, I know, I know.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Dan, I love Dan.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I'll tell you one thing that Sony does win in, and this is absolutely, you can't really, I think, argue this.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.000
If the systems were used for blunt force trauma, they definitely would win.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Because that system is heavy and quite solid.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000
360, it is pretty heavy, not quite as solid.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
The Wii, well, that's not very bad. Or not very good.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
You come after me with a PS3. I'll come after you with a 360 power supply.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
And we'll see who gets who.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
What?

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Dan, please.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Okay, last email. At least Dan's rambling has mean I've gotten to eat more bread and get more crumbs in my cleavage.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Excuse me.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000
No. Are you done?

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Okay, last email.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Hey, OLR. Love the show. I never miss an episode on the podcast feed.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
It's tough for me to catch the live show because I live on the East Coast and have young twins.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
I'm early to work on Monday morning, blah, blah, blah.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Basically, what I'm saying is that I have a tough time staying up as late as the show runs.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Oh, stop it with your sob story. No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Also, I love the fact that you guys, in podcast form, help me through the monotonous parts of my office job.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Amen.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Lately, I've been sad that the feed has been so far behind.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Is there any way that you could update the feed more regularly?

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I've been missing my OLR fix every week.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Yes, it got updated twice last week and will be updated twice this week and will be caught up.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
We're slowly catching up.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Again, it's just the side thing of having two computers running this thing off of.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
I just get far behind. I'm only one person.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
We're almost there.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Regardless, I appreciate your efforts as an independent podcast and wish you many more great episodes, Boston OLR fan.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
I hear that a lot that we help people through the work week.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
I know it's kind of depressing when your three-hour show you relied on isn't there, so I'm trying, guys.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.000
We'll get caught up. We're almost there.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
So, great. Thanks for the emails, guys. Send us more.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I'm hijacking this mother.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Next week's mailbag. Did you love Dan? Did you hate Dan?

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
There you go.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:13.000
It's good to get that out of the way next week because in two weeks it'll be all Street Fighter IV talk when it comes to Dan.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Word.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Loki, how about some more gaming news?

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Yes, let's talk a little bit about Red Dead Redemption, the sequel to Red Dead Revolver, and it's going to be very awesome.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:33.000
It's actually going to be using the Rage engine again, so very similar to what they did with Grand Theft Auto IV.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And, of course, they say that there's going to be the complete open world with strong plotlines in a massive, vibrant, rural environment.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
And it's supposed to be coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360. No sort of time frame, though.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Is that one out of left field or what?

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
A little bit, yeah.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:59.000
How about a new bully game? Somebody was just asking me about that the other night in a car ride about bully. How about a new bully game?

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000
How about a new Warriors game? I'm sorry. The first Warriors game was awesome.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
You get the Xbox Live one?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
No, that's unacceptable. That's crap.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I'm sure another bully will happen.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Because it was good, and it sold. But, seriously, it's like, how many years ago was Red Dead Revolver?

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000
That was like four years ago. So, I mean, you know, bullies still got two, three more years before we need a sequel for it.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
But then remember when we got Excite Truck?

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Excite Truck was, like, great.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Dude, I know Excite Truck was awesome, but I'm just saying, like, dude, how many years ago was Excite Bike?

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I don't even see Excite Truck, and Excite Bike is even remotely similar.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
The games play completely different, but they are kind of like, you know, they do.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
It makes me happy that Nintendo used the prefix Excite again.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Because it did excite me.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:51.000
For the third time. You got Excite Bike, Excite Bike 64, which is sweet, and if that's on a virtual console it should be,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:56.000
and Excite Truck, which is actually the best driving game on the Wii, right there with Mario.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Now they need Excite Tank.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Oh, dude, sweet.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Because nothing excites me more than the thought of driving a tank.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Or actually, Excite Truck with, like, a battle mode would be pretty awesome.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Excite Humvee.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Or, hey, let's take it even better.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Instead of an Excite Bike, or Excite Truck sequel, just do another Excite Truck game, but, like, with Mario stuff.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Like, making it like a Mario Kart off-road racing game.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
No! Shut up!

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000
It doesn't need, we don't need, Mario's everywhere already.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Excite Truck 2.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
It'll be very simple. Or just a new F-Zero, for God's sake.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
You know what?

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I'm sorry, yes, Star-Star?

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Excite Jet Ski.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Isn't that in Wii Sports? Isn't the new Wii Sports, what do they call it, Wii Sport Resort or whatever it's called?

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Yeah.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Doesn't that have a Jet Ski thing in it?

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Yes, it does.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I think it does.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Wave Race 65.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
SSJ100 Matt is flash-forwarding to E3 this year.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Nelly, that's Matt's wife, Nelly interviewing Reggie.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Why the fuck aren't you making Excite Truck 2?

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I would totally...

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Sad thing is, Nelly will have no idea who the hell Reggie is, so if that were to actually happen, it could.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.000
GS68 suggested Excite Butt.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
No, you can't drive a butt.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Alright, look.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
How about Excite Obama?

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Because, you know, Obama...

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Obama is exciting.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Obama excited a lot of people with his inauguration, election and all that, and is showing up in video games, apparently.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Go figure.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000
And this is in Street Fighter Online, Mouse Generation.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.000
This is not necessarily the same Street Fighter that you know and love over here.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.000
You know, this is an online one that's been going on for quite some time.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Some Valentine's Day, they have some chocolate-covered avatars that are being released.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Okay, whatever, but what's more kind of thought-provoking is the fact that there's a new character,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.000
and he bears a resemblance to a certain presidential figure very recently, and he's called...

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:01.000
By the way, the pack is called the Yes We Can Pack.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
If that doesn't tell you anything, I don't know what to tell you.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
And that's the most offensive version of Obama that I've ever seen.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
It really is. That is very offensive.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
But it's Japanese, so people go, it's cute.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I'll show you.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
He has some serious buck teeth.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Dark skin, short hair, come on.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
It's just the whole, you know, but it's just...

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
You know, I don't think anyone's going to truly be offended by it.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
It's Obama and his chocolate hair.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
That's interesting.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Is this Street Fighter Online? This isn't like a Capcom product.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
If he's meeting a Bush, I'll download it.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000
I don't...

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I pay money to see that shit.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Obama Punch!

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Maybe if they put Sarah Palin in it, I don't know.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
No, apparently, this is from a Japanese publisher.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000
The name of the publisher is Diletto, and they are co-owned by Capcom and Games Arena.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
So this is like, this is like a Capcom thing.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
This is like an official product.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Sorta.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
But in another country.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Like, you know, in Japan, in Marvel Superheroes vs. Street Fighter, on the Saturn,

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000
there was a character that they couldn't have anywhere else in the world,

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
because he was copyrighted, I guess.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Norimaro, right?

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
He was like a comedian.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Man, wouldn't it be sweet if there was a hidden American character and it was Obama?

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.000
What would be Obama's special power in this game?

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
We don't know.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Well, according to DJ Dark Knight in chat, a veto uppercut.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
He would have all of Sagat's moves, so he'd immediately be god tier.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
And I mean, he would just be like, veto, veto.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
I just had this image of Sagat, but actually, as Dick Cheney,

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
like, in a special movie, waterboarding.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Nice.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Or shooting you with a gun, as Dick Cheney.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
He would start off, like, in, gosh, which game was it where he was?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Where's Sagat?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Start off holding like Dan, and then he'd throw him aside,

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
but he'd start off and be like Bush.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Wasn't there, like, a guile move?

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Like, it was a rumored guile move, they'd pull out a pistol or something

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
and, like, shoot somebody?

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
That was, like, an urban fucking legend.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Some kid at the arcade knew a kid who saw a kid pull out a gun.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
But now with Dick Cheney.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Yeah, Dick Cheney.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
But he'd only shoot his partner in the face.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Now, a hidden character in this, would this be,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
would Hillary Clinton come out of the woodwork and, like,

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000
mix some shit up with this?

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I don't know what her special character is.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Or Sarah Palin might come out, who knows?

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Ariel Wolf shooting right there.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Here's the thing, the chat room is quick to point out,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.000
there is an Obama Japan.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
There is an Obama Japan, according to chat,

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
and I did remember seeing that on TV when he won.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
They were, you know, showing how excited they were in Japan and all that, so.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
All right, anyhow, if you want to join the festivities,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
chat.orangelandtrader.com, and I apologize to the folks on Justin TV

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000
because I just clicked over there and I see, like, the chat is filling up there.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Like, you have Deathwishing says Excitebike64 is my favorite game on the N64.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
It was a good game.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:50.000
And sorry guys, it's just really hard for us to watch two chat rooms at the same time

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000
and do a show, so sometimes Justin TV gets ignored, so I apologize.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000
But definitely join our main chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
and we'll read more of your comments as we can.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
All right.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news, shall we, Jimmy?

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Yes.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
If, God, the wind doesn't blow the garage door clear over, what?

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
It's like...

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
World of Warcraft!

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
God is Obama uppercutting the door.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
What about WoW?

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
There's going to be some changes.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.000
In the next World of Warcraft patch, we'll have some class changes, actually.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Again?

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:29.000
There is no more consumable ammunition for hunters.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
A boost of protection spec paladins.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.000
For real?

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Like, you don't have to get arrows anymore or whatever?

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
That makes me happy.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
That's strange.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Major improvements to the priest class, especially in group healing.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.000
General buffs for rogues and shamans.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Efficiency improvements for warriors and warlocks, with penalty for warriors changing stances being much lighter.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Plus mana regeneration being reigned in across the board.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Sweet!

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Somewhere an arms warrior is rejoicing.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
You can actually find more information on it on WoW Insider.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
They've got the specifics listed.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:15.000
But basically, they're trying to just streamline all the classes, trying to bring all the tanking classes in line.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Level, basically just trying to balance the game.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And also make the boss fights more challenging by decreasing the mana regeneration.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
The content has not gone into testing yet.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000
It should be going in before the release in the next couple of months.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
So, keep your eyes out.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.000
If any of our readers find out more, let us know.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Also, in patch 3.1, there will be a new raid dungeon called Ulduar, with an introduction of dual talent specializations.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Thank god! About fucking time.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
That's the rumor.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Well, after the 3.0.8 patch where hunters got nerfed hardcore, I guess this is a sad consolation that,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
oh, we'll no longer have to make you buy arrows ever again.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I guess that's the consolation that we get as hunters, or huntards, as I like to call myself.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
It hurts my feelings that I understood some of that.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Matt2, do you think this will be enough to get me back to WoW?

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Yes, short of me paying for your account again or whatever to do to get you playing back to the world of warcrack.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I actually kind of think that I want to start playing again just for a little bit.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Even though my last character was level 10.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.000
But as Rob pointed out at the beginning of the show, all 20 of my characters, which is really 9 of them, are all Nar'zhul.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Have you been gone for more than 3 months?

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Let me get you a scroll of resurrection because then we can get the uber item that lets us level up really quickly.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
You'll get my scroll.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Stay strong. Don't start playing again.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
No, no.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Just don't do it.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
You're better off without it. It's like smoking. You just don't need that.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Yeah, but WoW doesn't cause cancer.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
That's what you think.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Of course, our stigmatisms in our eyes might get worse and worse.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Dan thinks that it causes cancer to the sequel.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Is that cancer to electric boogaloo? What is this?

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Whatever.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000
It's because it's not cool to say that things cause cancer because people are dying of cancer.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.000
So I started saying that things cause cancer too.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Well, WoW causes electric boogaloo. It makes sense.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
WoW causes electric boogaloo.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
It's serious though. Don't start playing.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I don't know, but a new race engine...

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
You can be so much more about games when you don't play WoW.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
That's true. I play so many more games when I'm not playing WoW.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
You don't even know.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Satrombone.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Yes, satrombone. Low key.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Well, this is totally as far away from World of Warcraft as possible.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Battlefield 1943 is now slated to come out on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and Playstation Network this summer.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:50.000
It is going to be based on the same engine as Bad Company and will feature 24 player battles.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:08:00.000
And they had a few different maps, including Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima, which are based off of actual world locations.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:06.000
I think they actually used some of the topography maps and stuff like that for that.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
So, neat, I guess.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Also, around the same time, I believe they announced Battlefield Bad Company 2 as well.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Because really, if gaming needed anything besides more MMORPGs, it's more FPSs.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Thank God.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.000
I think, if I remember correctly, Bad Company 2 is right now for September.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Now, TigerClaw says it's nice for them to go back to the World War 2 roots.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Since, obviously, they can't really do the modern warfare stuff now because Call of Duty has owned it.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I do want to go back previously because this comment is pretty funny on the past story about WoW.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Rama in chat says WoW may not cause cancer, but it can cause breakups, cheating, and marriage counseling.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I have heard that.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
But the family that raids together stays together.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Alright, that's my counter-argument.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I am not going back to WoW.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
I'm going to play Perfect World because I said I was going to play Perfect World.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
For 30 days and you'll come play WoW.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I've been off of WoW for how long?

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
At it? And you're not even playing anymore?

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I'm not even playing right now. Why am I trying to recruit people?

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Alright, because I know Matt 2 is going to succeed in his efforts to try and get me back.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Yes, I am.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Anyhow, going back to EA.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I am, really.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And their conference call they had.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
News about Battlefield was not the only thing to come out of it and some of the things we talked about in Part A.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
But also Mass Effect has been confirmed that Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
It's not going to be Xbox exclusive.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
That's straight out of the mouth of CEO John Riccitello.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Also, Bad Company, the other Battlefield game, will be back on consoles in the year 2010.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
So, some point like January to March, but who knows?

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Really? I thought it was 2009, but I guess it's going to be delayed a lot more.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Probably even more than that.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
What, Mass Effect?

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.000
No, the other one. The Battlefield Bad Company.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I thought Mass Effect was a Microsoft Game Studios owned franchise.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
I didn't think Bioware carried it over with them.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Well, here's the thing, and I bet Black Wolf and Chad is right. He's saying it right.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
He's saying exactly what I'm thinking.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Multiple platform equals Xbox 360 and PC.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
I bet you that's exactly what it is.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Doesn't mean suddenly we're going to see PS3.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
And plus, we've also seen, you know, who knows?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000
You might get a Mass Effect spinoff on the DS.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Because we have seen that Microsoft is not opposed to letting their stuff go on, yeah, less effect.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Dual effect.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Seeing things go on the DS, Viva Pinata had a game on the DS, so it's possible.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
No, not Viva Pinata, Mech Assault.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:57.000
That would be an awesome game, like a mech game, but they're just giant pinatas.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Well, they've done Mech Assault on the DS, and it was not very good.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.000
But they did it. It was a Microsoft franchise.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
They did it. It was a Microsoft franchise.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
That's all I'm saying.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:17.000
But I was a completely different game, but it's kind of big like some of these Mass Effect games and stuff.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Borderlands, I actually watched some gameplay footage of.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.000
And that thing's going to be epic, and I think it's going to catch a lot of people off guard.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Because it's almost like Oblivion and Fallout with just a lot more fast-paced first-person gameplay and vehicles.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000
And Mad Max.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Alrighty then.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Well, let's move a little bit away from that world and go to a different kind of virtual world altogether.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
The world of Sims.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:50.000
I love The Sims, because I like building houses apparently, and then not doing anything.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Sims 3 actually has been talked about, but it's been delayed from the February 20th release date to sometime in early June.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:11.000
They're actually speculating June 2nd, with the non-PC versions being sometime later than that.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:22.000
They're also saying that the games will be released on PC and Mac and iPhone, iPhone Touch, and other mobiles.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
But the release date only really goes for the PC version.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:29.000
So, oh well.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Yeah, too bad.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Well, I mean, they're delaying a lot of stuff, so not surprised.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
And you know what?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
News of all these game delays.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000
I don't know about you guys, but I just get ticked off when I hear about all these game delays.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Because, you know, I get my hopes up to play these awesome sounding games, and then, aha, gotcha, delayed.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:54.000
And, you know, when I get ticked off like this, we start playing the angry music, and it causes the angry segment of our show to happen called the FUs of the Week.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Music

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
FU.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Yes, this is the FUs of the Week.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
The best part of the show.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:27.000
FU to my work for deciding that I need to help back up people on the phones, even though I don't get a single damn call, and it'll really suck because I've been having a really bad sore throat from my sinus infection.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.000
So, FU to the phones and talk to the people.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:46.000
FU the person that parks next to me at my apartment complex because they're parking right on the line and they haven't moved their car in like four days, and so it makes it almost impossible for me to get out of my car.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:53.000
I would really do some damage to their car, but someone's already keyed it, so apparently they do this other places as well, so.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Ah, fuck them.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
I actually don't have a lot of FUs of the Week.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
I had a pretty good week, so FU to me being so happy, I suppose.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:07.000
But, um, FU to, I'll say this, FU to sleeping in until noon and still feeling tired.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I hate that. Have you ever had that where you sleep so freaking much?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Although that's not the case because I didn't go to bed until five last night, but I have had this happen before where, like, you sleep so much that your eyes hurt and you're still tired.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I've had that happen. That sucks. FU to that.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Okay, Dan, do you have any FUs of the Week you want to share?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:27.000
FU to people who get bent about push release dates.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:36.000
There's other shit to play. Find a different game. Seriously. Those dates don't even exist for you.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Those are for retailers, like me, so I know when they're coming out and I know when to start pushing the product.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.000
You're not even supposed to know them! FU all.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Dan, we just have to work in this segment somewhere in the show, so just wait a second.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:53.000
You die. You die twice. I hope you get electric boogaloo.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
FU to being alive.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Matt, too! Do you have any FUs of the Week you'd like to share?

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I haven't thought this far ahead, but I guess FU to Weemageddon, the potential impending Weemageddon that may cause more console wars with each other.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000
And the Jerry Breckenheimer movie that will follow called Weemageddon.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000
That's right. That's right. It'll make millions upon millions of dollars.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:20.000
But I do agree that there are two main primary consoles in the Wii U for that one special demographic.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
FU to you for stealing my stolen word.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:28.000
FU, because you thought that first and I happened to say it.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
It's not even copyright.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000
That's why I said I stole it, and then you stole it from me.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Alright, FU both.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
And then you stole it from him.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.000
FU both. We're getting back into the news.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Loki doesn't even want it anymore.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000
We'll add a prefix to FU. S-T-F-U.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Oh, snap.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Oooh.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Alright, Loki. Do we have any more gaming news? I hope so.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Yes. I was going to say, I'm going to now copyright Super Weemageddon.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.000
The Super Weemageddon.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Well, a game that will not be featured on the Super Weemageddon 64 will be Puzzle Quest Galactrix.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Really? Because they do manage to port those Puzzle Quest games to everything.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
It is sad.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
It could be on Super Weemageddon 64 already.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
It will be coming out on DSPC, Xbox Live Arcade.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Apparently the PC version is coming around on February 24th.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:29.000
The Xbox Live Arcade date is unconfirmed, but you know me being the guessing man that I am.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I would say since the, I don't know, maybe probably the week after.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Puzzle Quest is cool. I was really afraid you were going to say it was cancelled.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
It's cancelled.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
No.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
What? No Atari 2600 port?

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.000
It's cancelled for Christmas, and Christmas is cancelled as well.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Puzzle Quest is awesome.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Happy Hanukkah!

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Although where the Galactrix thing comes from, I don't even know.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Galactrix comes from the fact that the game is different and it's set in space now.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
And they changed the engine. Like, you know, now it's the whole hexagonal thing.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000
But it's pretty cool, actually. If you've played the demo, it's pretty addicting, I think.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Just put friggin' Puzzle Pirates on Xbox Live Arcade game.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Seriously. Seriously. Seriously.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000
It's really meant to be a portable game, though. I can't see sitting there.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Yeah, Puzzle Pirates would be an awesome DS, like, MMO.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000
I can't see playing, like, Puzzle Quest on my 360.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.000
But I could totally see playing that on the PSP.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Also, out of EA, some other news. It's not related to Puzzle Quest, but one other little piece of news that's out of EA.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Apparently, they are now going to be getting the Bourne series over there.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Or, I guess what's going on, it's not just really the Bourne.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000
What's happened, they've picked up the rights to publish games that are based on Robert Ludlam stories.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
He is the guy who made the Jason Bourne series.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.000
So, apparently the first game in the series is going to be made by Star Breeze Studios.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
No word on exactly what that game is, but...

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Because the first game was so awesome that they really needed to make a sequel to it?

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:05.000
You know, I'm not surprised these games sell pretty well, though, because the Bourne series is kind of one of those series that...

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000
You know, a lot of people don't talk about it, but a lot of people watch these movies.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
You know, all of them broke 100 million at the box office.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Matt Damon!

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
They all do very well, yes, because of Matt Damon.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.000
What other books has he written? I mean, I'm not really familiar with...

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
It is a Bourne title they're working on, by the way.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I'll start with The Bourne, and end with, like, something.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
The Bourne Cakery.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Nice.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Okay. The Bourne Cooking Mama. No, I don't know.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:43.000
So, there you have it. EA has picked up the Bourne rights, and who knows what else from the same author.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
The Bourne Oven.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000
I like this idea of picking up rights to authors' stories, though.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Like, could you imagine, like, you know, J.D. Salinger rights getting picked up?

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000
We'd have The Catcher in the Rye game.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Hey, we've had Discworld games before.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Roald Dahl gets picked up. We could finally have Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, the game.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000
It'd be pretty amazing.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:09.000
It was certainly better than that shit-tastic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory game they put out a couple years ago.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I'm picking up the rights to the Bible.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Sorry, those little offshoot companies already did Bible adventures. Hello?

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.000
I don't know if, like, God's rights are for sale.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:26.000
I pick the...

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
I'm so glad you didn't have a mic when you said that.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I pick the rights to the gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster game.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000
I am going to do a Flying Spaghetti Monster game.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Fine, I'm buying the rights to the articles in Playboy.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Seriously, if you want to make a badass game, license the Oblivion Engine and the Bible.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.000
And just combine them. How fucking nuts would that be?

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Or as Frisbee puts in the chat, SuperChristPuncher64.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Jesus, punch!

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And if you die, you just get resurrected.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
You don't really have to buy the rights to the Bible. I think it's in public domain.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
So if you wanted to make that game, you could make it.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Then why do they sell Bibles on TV?

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
No, seriously, I'm selling the rights to the Bible.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.000
If you want to buy a Bible, I'm your man.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Ray Bradbury, you go around burning books in, like, Fahrenheit 451. I can just see it now.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Please, more gaming news that isn't related to religion.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Flying Spaghetti Monster.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I said not religion.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.000
For some people, Final Fantasy VII is a religion.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
These people need lives.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:52.000
At any rate, the Blu-Ray edition of the movie will have a dub soundtrack.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Which is why I'm importing that bitch.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:59.000
And not because Final Fantasy XIII demo is going to be on there at all.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Oh no, not for that or anything.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.000
No, never for that. No, it's going to have an option.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.000
I do want the Final Fantasy XIII demo.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:17.000
But it actually, if you do buy that Blu-Ray version though, it's going to have the English voice track.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Did you download the HD Final Fantasy XIII trailer on PlayStation 3?

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
No.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I seriously think I got a boner from watching that trailer. It was pretty hot.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Noise.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I'm hearing way too much about cocks on this show tonight.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
At least we've had a mention of boobs.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Speaking of cocks, Guns N' Roses Chinese...

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Wow, Loki just won best transition ever. Congratulations.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Guns N' Roses Chinese Democracy album is coming to Rock Band this spring.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Yeah, no word on the price, but it's coming.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Don't worry, it's going to be delayed.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:10.000
It's going to be coming actually February 28th, so that's kind of soon.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:19.000
And then also, Rock Band is going to be getting some new download content with the re-release of Pearl Jam's X album.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000
They're going to have a code for three bonus tracks in Rock Band.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Very similar to what they did with System of the Down.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000
I think they had three tracks that were available with their album as well.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.000
So you can probably bet that these will be available as well later on.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
But the three tracks will be available for free download.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Brother, Alive, and State of Love and Trust.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Rock Band is costing themselves some serious cool points.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.000
First was the janky way you had to pay 40 bucks for ACDC Live, which you can get for 30 bucks now.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:52.000
The second is the whole Chinese democracy thing.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Come on, quit trying to stuff like these giant packs on us.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
It's terrible. Terrible stuff.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Making us buy ACDs. Just put them up on the network. Come on.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Well, it's going to be on the network. The Chinese democracy thing is going to be on the network.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Yeah, but see, that just sucks.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
It's not that I'm trying to say it's like, oh, they're doing it that way.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000
I'm just trying to say it's like, come on, bring us something that's relevant that we want.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Axl doesn't deserve to be rewarded. Axl deserves to be punched in the face.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:26.000
And the ACDC thing, I want ACDC Live, but I don't want to pay 30 bucks for it.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000
When it hits 20 at Walmart, I'm there.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I'm excited about Pearl Jam. That is their single best and only fantastic album.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
How long is that album? Are we out?

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Yes.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:43.000
That is one of the last CDs that I have ever owned.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.000
That every damn track on it was fantastic.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Can we seriously get a Journey album right now?

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:49.000
No shit.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Seriously?

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
And it's not that Pearl Jam isn't good.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
It's just that Journey's better.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Right. But I don't want to buy 10 again so I can get three rock band songs.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:03.000
And yes, there's a there's a egregious dearth of Journey.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
There needs to be way more of it.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Every Journey song would be great.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.000
For real. That's what they need to be selling at Walmart, is the Journey game.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
What is the one that's on...

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Any way you want it, that's the way you need it.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
That's great. But I mean, there's...

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
So much more. So much more.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:24.000
A little more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:28.000
We love our music game roots and we have to mention music games whenever we see new ones.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000
That's right.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
I don't know if this one exactly would qualify.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
It's a game called D-Pad Hero.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:39.000
That's right. There's so much love out there for Guitar Hero and everything that this whole thing started.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:43.000
That they have actually made a retro demake, not a remake.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
I don't know how you feel. I know you love remakes.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I don't know how you feel about demakes though.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:52.000
D-Pad Hero. That's right. It's Guitar Hero, but you use the D-Pad to play the game.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000
And actually, there's actually a little video that leaked on YouTube here.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I shouldn't say leaked, but they actually put it out here kind of showing how the game works.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000
If you're hearing the noises in the background there, that's what I'm trying to load here in studio.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Although it's kind of having a hard time buffering.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I was so sure you said D-Bag Hero at first. I didn't even...

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Like Douchebag Hero?

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000
I don't think that would play exactly the same way.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I was like, what? Oh. Oh, okay.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.000
No, not D-Bag Hero. D-Pad Hero.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Sorry. Enunciate.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Alright, I just need to clean my ears or something.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Anyhow, I don't know why the video's not working, but it's not.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
But apparently you have all these different...

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
But the thing is that you actually...

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000
You guys know he's making that up, right?

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
You actually get these music things in NES style.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:44.000
So it actually has, speaking of Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine that you can actually play in like it's NES style.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.000
There you go. I really want to see if we can get a...

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Because they actually have this too.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:54.000
They have Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger in this game as well by Daft Punk.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Let me see if one of these other videos will work here a little better.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Let's see, here's a little...

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
And these little things fall down.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Looks like you actually hold the D-Pad in a certain direction when you push the button.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
So it does have a little bit of a challenge to it.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
And there actually is a little audience that rocks out.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:21.000
See, there's like one guy bobbing up and down there in the background.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
This song is awesome.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:31.000
This is actually a pretty faithful remake of the song.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000
And Amae Satsuma in chat says,

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:43.000
He wants Tea Bag Hero. I don't know about that. Featuring an all Madonna soundtrack. I don't know about that.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Alright, that's going to do it for news right now.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Let's go to the Skype line, but actually we're going to take a call right off the top here.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
We actually have some people sitting there waiting on hold.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Callers, you guys there?

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Yeah, we're here.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Hi. Hello, hello. This is Rama and SSJ100 Matt, correct?

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Yep, we're here.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.000
So why are you kids calling us tonight? What's going on?

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
New York Comic Con.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Ah, that's right. Of course, our New York City listeners.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I'm sure you guys were banging down the doors of New York Comic Con.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
How was it? Tell us about it, you guys.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
You first, Matt.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Well, I had a lot of fun.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.000
I mean, this is the first Comic Con I went to because this is the first time I've been back in New York for a long time.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:32.000
But, Comic Con has kind of turned itself into, you know, a normal comic convention into, you know, just a whole geek fest of everything.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:37.000
And now, this year, they kind of expanded the game section.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000
So now half the convention is more so video game stuff.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:46.000
And they had a lot of new games there that I was excited to play, so.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:52.000
That's cool. It sounds like it's practically turning into the San Diego Comic Con because they don't really talk about comics at the San Diego.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.000
No, they do. But, I mean, a lot of it is Hollywood panels.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Like, when I heard there was a Sarah Silverman show panel at Comic Con, I'm like, what the fuck does that have to do with comics? Nothing.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
We read comic books, so we should have a panel. I don't know.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Comic Con has long since been perverted away from comic books.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Apparently. But that's okay. We like gaming, so that's pretty cool.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000
And I just want to point out, guys, as well, since we are kind of getting used to this whole new Skype setup,

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:24.000
they can't hear the Skype calls on Justin.tv, and that's just one of the downsides to the way things are wired now and have the better sound quality.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.000
So, sadly, if you want to hear both ends of the call, you have to be tuned into All Games Radio, where we're turning in live.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Sorry, guys. We'll see if we can fix that in the future, but can't do it right now while we're on a call.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000
So tell us about the types. What games did you guys get out there and actually play?

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Well, actually, to tell you the truth, it was very, very easy to play a lot of the games.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I was surprised, because I went there on Saturday, where it was the busy, busy day, where everyone was there.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:56.000
So I had to wait about 15 minutes, probably, per game to get up a game.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:02.000
But I could spend the entire call talking about every single game there, but I'll just talk about three.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:10.000
The three that I got a chance to play were MadWorld, which is coming out for the Wii.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:18.000
If anyone hasn't seen it, it's kind of like if Sin City was a Wii game.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Interesting. So this is a nice departure from Wii Mageddon, which has been talked about earlier, and I've heard about this game before.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:26.000
MadWorld, Dan?

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
MadWorld. We got to check it out last September.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000
You a fan?

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.000
It's pretty hardcore for a Wii game.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:40.000
It's kind of got a Killer7 vibe, if anyone's checked out Killer7, but it's hyper-violent.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:45.000
It's all black and white, except for when you're laying out some carnage and then you get a lot of blood.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Definitely one of the coolest titles for the Wii.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
What did you think, Matt?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
I thought it was great.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:06.000
They had a challenge in the game where you basically have to shove guys into a pit, and every couple of minutes a giant thing just drops down and crushes everything in the pit.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:15.000
It was funny. Every single time you throw a guy in, they get crushed. A pool of blood slowly fills up, and more guys you throw in there, they start drowning in the blood.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:21.000
It's a pretty brutal game, and it might get me to buy a Wii game.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Interesting. All right. That's a pretty hearty endorsement. What else did you check out?

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Another game which I think Loki would be interested in is Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars for the DS.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000
I heard this was out on the floor. What did you think?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:51.000
When I originally heard they were going to make a Grand Theft Auto DS game, I was kind of skeptical, but when I got a chance to play it, I got admitted. It's a pretty good game.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:31:07.000
It kind of goes back to the old top-down GTAs, like GTA 2, but the animation is very smooth and everything. It's got a lot of cute gimmicks in it.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:16.000
If you're calling for a cab, you basically whistle into the DS for the cab. It's got a lot of cool things like that.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Is there any special thing for when you want to get the hooker to blow you in the shooter?

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:27.000
You've got to hold some money up in front of it and crinkle the dollars together.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Seriously though, if you want to see what Grand Theft Auto is going to look like when it's on Nintendo 64, there you go. Chinatown Wars, baby.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:44.000
They've got a little thing in there where it's like Dope Wars, if you kind of remember that from old handheld calculators and all that.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:48.000
That Dope Wars was awesome.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Loki, anything you want to say about the Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Looks neat. I'm planning on playing it.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
What was the third game?

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:03.000
The third game, which I consider was the best game there, was the Ghostbusters game.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I've heard some good things about this. Tell us a little bit about the Ghostbusters game. What's it like?

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:18.000
It's kind of like what everyone seems to think it is. It looks and feels like Gears of War, but with Ghostbusters.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
What version did they have there?

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:31.000
They had every single version. They had the PS3, the 360, and the Wii version. The Wii version is the only one that looks different. It kind of looks a little more cartoony than the others.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:38.000
It's just as fun. I managed to get to play the Wii and the 360.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I heard that the Wii was an FPS version where you use your remote to capture ghosts and your nunchuck for movement.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.000
The 360 version is more like a third person shooter.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:56.000
You basically use the nunchuck to throw the trap and all that.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
That's awesome.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
Matt, I've been letting you do all the talking, but Rama, did you go too? What did you check out?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I was mostly in the dealer's room, but I was able to check out one game. I think it's a game that everybody loves. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in Time.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:20.000
It was there to celebrate the 25th shell-a-versary of the Ninja Turtles.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:27.000
The shell-a-versary. I heard there was an old school Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine there.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Yes, and there were crowds upon crowds for people to jump in and play.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Isn't that sad that with all these new games that are making their debut there, you have Jumpgate and Prototype and Madworld and WrestleMania and Conduit.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:46.000
People are lining up to play TMNT 2, the arcade game.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Because quality persists. That is an amazing game.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000
I'd be in line playing that.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:02.000
The last E3 we got to go to, there was a DDR and 2DX machine that year and there were people that were playing it all day long.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:05.000
And I'm like, dude, you guys are at E3 and you're playing fucking DDR?

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Was that a recent mix of 2DX or was it like an old one?

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:16.000
It was a mix of 2DX that you can't really get at the time. Wasn't here yet.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:19.000
But the DDR mix I don't think was anything new. I think they just had Supernova.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
So it was kind of surprising.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Was it Supernova 2? I don't remember. It was a while ago.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
It was a while ago.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Anyway, enough about a years old con.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Actually, I don't think it was Supernova 2.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Oh, it doesn't matter.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.000
It wasn't out.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I want to hear about New York Con.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:41.000
So you got to play the new Turtles thing and how was it?

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:47.000
The new Turtles game, I'm not sure if they had it on out for own.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000
I didn't think so.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
They just kept advertising it.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000
I do know it was pretty much from the people that did on Smash Brothers Brawl.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
So I think this is going to be a good title that they're working on.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Well, we'll see. I'm a little skeptical because some of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games are kind of ass, but we'll see.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Did anybody see Hawks?

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000
It was on display.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Yeah, I got to play Hawks.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
How was it?

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
It's like a very polished Ace Combat.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Sweet.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
And yeah, it's a lot of fun.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
I like shooting things with jets.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Alright, so really quickly guys, then we're going to let you go because we've got to get some more calls because we're kind of running long tonight.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:24.000
But best thing you saw at Comic Con, Matt?

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Aside from the Ghostbusters game, there's a new game called Prototype, which is coming out for the 360.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
It's awesome.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:45.000
It's everything what Spider-Man Web of Shadows should have been. It's really brutal and free roam New York City mutant thing. It's really great.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Alright, and Rama, best thing?

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000
It has to be a tie. Number one, the Ninja Turtles arcade machine.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:59.000
And number two, the attempt at breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for the biggest amount of video game cosplayers and one shutting.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Did you break it?

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:07.000
No. The record was 342. There was 90 of us.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Street Fighter IV there?

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Maybe next year.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
I suppose I think it was. I don't know.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Was it your favorite?

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Wait, what?

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
You saying Street Fighter IV was there and it wasn't your favorite?

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Okay.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Well, I didn't see it there.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Ron Tron.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Yes?

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
We need to do that at Fandame.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
No, because that title has got to come back to the US.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
We need to do this at Fandame.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Alright.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Before I go, if you see pictures of us at the video game shoot, you'll be seeing me in the back holding up a giant Super NES.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Nice.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:49.000
And actually two quick last things. I'm posting pictures in the chat regularly.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Awesome.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:57.000
And also one very last thing. Expect a care package of schwag coming in the mail.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Oh, you guys are the best.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000
I love the fans. We don't even have to go to these events and we get goodies. Love it.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Thank you guys so much.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Not a problem.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Have a good one, kids. See you later.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Speaking of our fans doing nice stuff for us, I would like to personally thank IkumaJP for the box of puka.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Which, by the way, I do still have some of the nom noms in the house if you guys want some of the nom noms.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Alright, we're going to go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Hi, this is Spazinator.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Two quick questions.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:40.000
With the Xbox 360, do you know if there's a hard driver available that's bigger than 120 gigs?

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Not yet. It's just a matter of time, though.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Well, the reason I ask is because I hate to see it, but my hard drive is running out of space as it is.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Also, secondly, can you think of any retro games that you would like to see released for any one of those three systems?

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:09.000
I'm sorry, run that by me one more time?

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:23.000
You know how retro games are kind of big and they're constantly getting released for all three systems, whether it be Wii, Virtual Console, the PlayStation 3, or XBLA.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Can you think of any game that you would like to see released for one of those three, or are you pretty much all set?

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Mega Man 10.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:37.000
What, that will be released, or that was released?

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.000
You would like to because he released.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Mega Man 10 at some point would be awesome.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:46.000
As long as they stay with the Mega Man 9 series and do a Mega Man 10, that'd be great.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Mega Man 9 was awesome for all three systems, but of course was the best on the Wii because it was just the most authentic retro, new retro experience.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:06.000
I'm surprised that, I mean, I'm not surprised, but Bionic Commando Rearmed would be really nice on the Wii if they decided to do it.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:14.000
I don't think the game that needs to be remade, that was out before its time, and I mean, I know that I hate this game and I hate the fanboys for it.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Although I approve of fanboyism and go for it, love what you love.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:25.000
I really think that the game that needs a remake, needs it for anything powerful enough to run it, is Final Fantasy VII.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:33.000
So I'd like to see Final Fantasy VII remade for every console with state-of-the-art 3D graphics and the storyline re-translated so it makes sense,

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.000
and more party options, and just kind of the fleshing out that it really needs.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:43.000
But you know if they make it they're just going to dumb it down, it's going to be simpler and easier than it even was before, which was too easy to do.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.000
But at least it'll have real nice CGI.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Yeah, I definitely agree with you. I'd love to see a remake of VII, you know, because I used to love that game.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Unfortunately I don't have my copy of it anymore, so if they ever do release the game again, I'll buy it.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:08.000
I'll buy anything but the DS, you know, because the DS will just basically be able to do it as it originally was.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Well, thank you for taking my call.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
You are welcome.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Alright, you have a good one.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
Take care Spazinator, have a good one.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:23.000
I don't know whether Final Fantasy VII would fit on Xbox Live Arcade, that's the only problem I see going on with that, but who knows, we'll see.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Yeah, because you know if they wanted to make it, Microsoft wouldn't make an exception.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
We'll see. Alright, we got another call.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Hello, this is DSMaster25.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Hi, what's on your mind?

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Not much. Urban got a PSP 2000, but it's kind of flukey on me, I buy it used.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Wait, I find this ironic, because your name is DSMaster, yet I'm looking at your logo on Skype and your call is about a PSP. Please explain.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Basically, I was desperate for one, because I wanted Skype and everything, so I figured why not buy a PSP, so basically I did.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
You wanted what game?

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I wanted to use Skype, portably, but the Skype zones were not in America, so the only other option was a PSP.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Interesting, okay, okay.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:26.000
So basically, I bought one used, now I have this cracked on my screen, and now my start button, my select button, my home button, all that doesn't work.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:36.000
It sounds like you have a broken PSP. I would recommend replacing it with a new working one, preferably a 3000 series, because if you wanted to use Skype...

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:40.000
He said he bought it used, I'm curious, did you buy it used at GameStop?

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Yes.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Sad trombone.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Well, did you buy it like that, or did you buy it nice and you made it like that?

02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Because if you bought it like that, take that puppy back. Hopefully you were smart enough to buy the extended service on it.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Unfortunately, I was dead broke by the time I bought the PSP, so I didn't have any money to buy the extended service.

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Sad trombone.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
What was wrong with the PSP now?

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:17.000
This is just a sad trombone call.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Basically, the home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and sound...

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Do they not test these things? Do they not notice him scratch on the screen, or a big crack on the screen?

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Because I know when you have to go trade stuff in there, it's like, does this shit work?

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Well, here's the deal. You're about to get an education as to the inside workings of used game stores.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:43:03.000
They get ranked on how much they get traded in, so a lot of times they'll let crap slide, and then they get ranked on selling you stuff.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000
So they're going to try to foist it on you.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Now, there are game stores like mine where if you bring me a system, man, I'm looking for a reason to say no, because I'm a jerk.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Honest. It's like, you bring me an Xbox, I've already got five Xboxes. If that thing ain't pristine, I'm like, take it home with you. I don't want it.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:28.000
But at the same time, it's like, if you bought a system from GameStop, and it's broken, you have a guarantee. Hopefully you didn't buy it that long ago.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Take that puppy back. Make him exchange it for a nice one.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:39.000
If you bought it months ago, and you've just been dealing with it being all broken, and you let it go, I mean, you better go to the manager and bank.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:45.000
And just, you know, don't be a jerk about it, because he'll dig in, but, you know, hopefully they can give you some satisfaction.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Don't try to be like, well, I want a new system or my money back. Just be like, look, I'm not looking for anything more than the same unit in nice shape.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:01.000
You know, that works for what I need to do. You know, systems get tested, but it's, every store is run by different people.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:07.000
That's why there's bad, you know, GameStop as a corporation is reasonably evil, but that's just like any corporation.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000
They're there to make money. There's good stores, and those stores deserve you to go shop there.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:17.000
And there's bad stores, and those stores deserve for you to sit outside in your running car, and when they come out at night, just run them over.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:22.000
And then maybe they'll get some good people in there, and you can have another good game store.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Orange House Radio does not actually endorse this thing.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
So what you're telling me-

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Okay, they may not endorse it officially, but you know they're all down with it.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
I'm down with it.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Hey, so what you're telling me is basically go back in there, because my 30 day guarantee has already passed, because I bought this on December 22nd.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Otherwise, you know, the buttons and stuff not working? I mean, which buttons are not working on there?

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:57.000
The home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and the sound equizer.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
For what it's worth?

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Stop, stop you guys. Okay, so basically all the buttons on that bottom row, right?

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Yeah, except for start. That's the only one that works.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:16.000
It sounds like the ribbon cable's loose in there, so that would be easy enough just to take it apart, and you can actually plug that back in if you want to do that.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.000
And then replacing the screen's like 30 bucks, I think.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Well, that's if they stonewall you on just giving you some satisfaction.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:29.000
I believe GameStop has a one month guarantee on a used system. Get that puppy back ASAP.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Now, if you chopped a game crazy, we'd give you a 90 day guarantee without you even paying any extra money.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Nice, nice. Now here's the thing.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Plug, plug, plug.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
For what it's worth, your call sounds great.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:50.000
And you'll be funny with the PSP system. I don't know if you could do one on them where you buy a used system and swap it for the broken one.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
You sold me a busted system.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:58.000
They're serial numbered, but I mean, you know, if you want to try a fast one that's on you, I can't tell you to do that or not tell you that.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:01.000
That's up to your quality of being a human being.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:06.000
But, hey, I won't say I've never done anything like that.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:11.000
I think I'm going to wait until I get money, and then I'm going to buy 3,000.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:16.000
You know, go back. And then I'll use this one for like emulators.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
That's a good idea.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:25.000
I think the advice too would just be, you know what, go in, anyone else that finds themselves in this situation, go in, be nice about it.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Don't be a dick because no manager is going to want to do favors for you if you're a dick.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Go in, be nice about it, and see if they'll do a favor for you.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
And if not, run them over with your car.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.000
But your other idea was great, especially if, like Loki says, there's a ribbon cable in there.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:45.000
If you like taking crap apart, and you're out of warranty and can't get any help, take that puppy apart.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
PSPs are awesome inside.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.000
There's all sorts of cool stuff you can do with them.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.000
You can blow up their batteries and lose pieces, change the color of the buttons.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Turn them into lasers?

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:03.000
No, but seriously, there's a lot of stuff inside there.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:08.000
If someone took it apart to, I don't know, do something, you know, they may have accidentally fucked something up.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Because it's pretty easy to do that because I've done that before when I took something apart.

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Oh, the ribbon cable's not all the way in, and you have to really shove that puppy back in there, and then it'll probably work.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Because it sounds like that might be the issue, because all of a sudden the buttons won't just die.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
It's the ribbon cable.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Yeah, one of the janky things about used PSPs, you've got to watch out.

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:34.000
No, but basically what happened was I bought it, and all the bottom row buttons were working just fine.

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.000
And then the Monday show after, I was listening to you guys in the shower, okay?

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Oh, so now it's our fault.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
No, no, no, no.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Now, see, this is just getting weird in reverse.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Basically, I'm trying to change the volume, and I'm reaching through the shower curtain, and I think I might jump some water, but I don't know.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Well, see, okay, now wait a minute. Now this is all on you, buddy. You broke your PSP.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Okay, keep this one for use in the shower, and you're doing it, and keep it away from the water.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
What is the water?

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:07.000
I'm just curious, is this an OA verse that you've been listening to in the shower?

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
I'm just curious.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:17.000
If you do want to use it in the shower, they do sell waterproof cases you can put on the PSP.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:20.000
All right, DS Master, we've got to let you go to get some more help.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
I'm just saying, if that's your thing.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Are you all soapy?

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Good luck.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:34.000
DS Master, good luck to you, and next thing, if you do get a new PSP, keep it out of the bathtub.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:41.000
By the way, the only reason why I bought this one was because I was speculating about the scan lines on the 3000 model.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Now I figured it's not such an interesting issue.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
It's all the same, it just has a mic.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:51.000
All right, good luck, PSP, DS Master, whoever you are, and have a good one, okay?

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
All right, bye.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:57.000
I don't know if that guy's ever called in before. I might have been a first-time caller, so that was a good call.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:07.000
I like the... Oh, good times. We'll try to do at least one more call here and then wrap up the show.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
It's Death Wishing. Hey, what's up?

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Well, hi, Death Wishing. You're a first-time caller too, aren't you?

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
Yep.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
What's on your mind?

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:25.000
I'm kind of disappointed with a lot of stuff I see in this year for gaming.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:30.000
In this year of gaming, in 2009 in gaming? How so? Just because it seems like there's nothing to look forward to?

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:35.000
I know it just started, but it's just... I don't know. This summer seems a lot more droughted.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
I can already tell this summer it's going to be a major drought for gaming.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Do you think it might be that everybody's trying to keep it in their pants until E3?

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:45.000
That's kind of one thing I've been trying to tell myself as much as I might be lying to myself.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Maybe people are trying to keep it in their pants until E3.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
That would be different.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:55.000
You've got to remember, games and game developers are like plants.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:59.000
And their water is money. And there's no money out there right now.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.000
So things are quiet.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:07.000
You've got to actually think, this summer there's not going to be crap anyway.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:10.000
You've got to look towards the fourth quarter.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:14.000
They're not going to be making announcements about the fourth quarter until mid-spring,

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:18.000
when they've gotten through the Street Fighter IV and the Resident Evils and the Killzone II.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.000
You've got some... I mean if you actually think about it, this is a great spring for games.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:28.000
There are some just nice AAA titles for every system.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Nintendo had a great Christmas, at least in the States with the Wii.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:35.000
I know they're having a lot of trouble in Japan.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:40.000
But really, I think that if you look at a lot of the release lists and whatnot,

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:44.000
there's a lot of cool stuff coming out for everybody.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.000
Skip the Summer, there'll be a big title or two, but it's not going to blow any wind up your skirt.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:54.000
And then just look to the fourth quarter, man.

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
That's where all the big games are.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Dan does have a point, because our economy is in such shit right now in the US.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I don't know if you're calling for the US or wherever.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:08.000
But the thing is, it seems like on this show, week after week after week,

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.000
we've been reporting, this studio has closed, this studio has closed, this studio has closed.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:15.000
So damn, we're kind of lucky to be getting to get any games at all at this point.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:18.000
But I do kind of agree. I feel that same frustration.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:22.000
It seems like every game comes out at Christmas.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:26.000
It seems like the rest of the year, and we don't know what's coming out at Christmas yet,

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:29.000
because they're going to wait and announce all that stuff at E3 probably.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:30.000
You're going to see all the Christmas titles.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:35.000
But right now, especially on Nintendo, it seems like there's nothing to look forward to on the Wii.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:39.000
There's a couple gems here and there on 360 and PS3.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Maybe your Street Fighter IV. There are some little things here and there, but not enough.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Gamers get spoiled. They expect big releases every month.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Maybe because Hollywood spoils us. There's a big movie every week.

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Movie games still happen.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
So don't get me started on movie games.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:02.000
You're not in the first two years of any console's development cycle now.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:07.000
They've all proven what they have to prove, except for Sony.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Look at Sony's lineup. They've got three killers.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:16.000
They've got Killzone, which is two weeks a week away.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:21.000
They've got Uncharted 2, which if you have a PS3, Uncharted is fantastic,

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
and it's really good, and you should have played it.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:26.000
And they've got God of War.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Microsoft is kind of like, oh, we've got ODST. We've got Halo, but it's not really Halo.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:36.000
And they've kind of let their big franchises slip away from them.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Nintendo, there was an article not far back.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Nintendo's got half a dozen really cool releases coming up for the Wii,

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:45.000
but it's all your ma and pa mainstream stuff, except we've got Punch-Out on there.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Punch-Out for the Wii should be pretty cool.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
But not as cool as Street Fighter IV.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Dude, I don't know if Punch-Out is awesome.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:55.000
But it's not Street Fighter IV. Punch-Out and Street Fighter IV.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:58.000
The Wii and the PS3 and the 360, they're two different worlds.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:01.000
What does Mike Tyson have on a Hadoop, honestly?

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Dude, have you played Mike Tyson's Punch-Out?

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:08.000
If you threw Ryu in there against Mike Tyson, he's got a one uppercut knockdown.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:11.000
But there's Ryu and Ken, and one's Hadoop, and one's Hadoop.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:15.000
I'm not a Hadoopkin. It's going to take off a third of your life.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:19.000
Mike Tyson takes off all your life with one punch.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:24.000
And if you don't dodge all those punches, you can't even block him.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:27.000
He made Shang Rong look like a sissy.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:31.000
You know what we have now? We have Obama with the veto uppercut.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I fought Akuma last night in HD Remix, and I got beat uncontrollably hard.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:40.000
But at least I could hit him. Mike Tyson and Punch-Out, your ass is grass.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Put in 0073735963 in the password. Fight Mike Tyson.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:49.000
If you beat him, then I'm going to give you your props.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Wait, let me ask this as well real quick.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:56.000
For what it's worth, are you a 360 owner?

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
Yes, I do own a 360.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Does it still work?

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Okay, honestly, I'm on my second 360, and I had it from release.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Okay, me too. I'm on my second one after release too.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
But actually, what I just kind of want to ask, I don't know,

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:14.000
but just kind of also something that can kind of tide you over,

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:18.000
is that don't forget, you still have coming out every week,

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:21.000
not just Xbox Live Arcade games, but community games.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.000
And I realize there's a lot of poop out there in the community games,

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
but there's a lot of pretty awesome stuff too.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:30.000
And you know, when you consider that in the retail world,

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
you know, we get poop as well, like Fusion Frenzy

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
and that fucking Crosswords game that I played this week.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:35.000
It was god awful.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:36.000
You know, you get a lot of that stuff.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
There's some pretty cool stuff that comes out too.

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:41.000
So if you're feeling like, damn, I need a fix of something new,

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
check out the community games.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
You might not see anything that's going to blow you away,

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
but you might see something that, you know,

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:50.000
a neat concept for a game that keeps you entertained for a little while,

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:51.000
which is, you know, what a game should do.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:54.000
And when you consider those community games are dirt cheap,

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
eh, it's something.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
And look past the big franchises.

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Bionic Commando, which is coming out in a couple months, a month or so.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Looks great.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Mad World, which we talked about a few minutes ago.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
It's mind blowing.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Halo Wars is actually pretty fun.

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
You know, there's a lot of stuff coming up this year,

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:15.000
but maybe it's not Devil May Cry 5.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Maybe it's not Halo 4.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Just, you know, let that stuff lay for a while.

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:21.000
You know they're going to rehash it.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000
They're going to spit it at us.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:23.000
There's going to be a marketing blitz.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:27.000
You know, there's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 and 6 and 8 and 10.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:30.000
But, you know, here's your chance to branch out.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Try some new games.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:35.000
You know, just because they're not beating you down with another AAA title

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.000
doesn't mean there aren't super high quality games by great developers

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:43.000
who still have jobs, knock on wood, and will be blowing you out of the water.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
And like I said, look to the fourth quarter,

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:46.000
because there are big names announced.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
Especially if you don't have a Sony, you know,

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:54.000
go for God of War is going to be, you know, blamed by the better.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:55.000
Badass.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:56.000
All right.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:57.000
Death Wishing, we've got to let you go to close out the show,

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
but thanks a bunch and thanks for tuning in tonight.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:00.000
We appreciate it.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Love you.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
All right, see ya.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:04.000
I think so.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:05.000
I love you too.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:06.000
We love you too.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
Okay.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:09.000
We have last minute stories.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Huh?

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Yeah, we do have some last minute stories.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
I do want to make an outbound call real quick.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:14.000
This is an important one.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:15.000
We do want to do one more call.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
This is outbound, because this is important.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:18.000
We want to get this person on the show.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
And unfortunately, the way our Skype is set up,

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
we have not been able to get like incoming.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
We just get bombarded with everybody, which we love.

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
You know, we love the fact that so many people are trying to get through,

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000
but there is somebody we wanted to talk to that couldn't get through.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:30.000
And we want to talk to him now.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Deke, are you there?

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Yeah, I'm here.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Can you guys hear me?

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Yes, we can.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:35.000
How are you?

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:36.000
Oh, not bad.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Tired.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:38.000
It's 10 30 here.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:42.000
The reason why I'm letting you have cuts tonight and come to the front of the line.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
You get cuts tonight is because Deke,

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:47.000
you've got the mastermind behind our new website that is out there

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
that the folks have been looking at.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Have you been happy with the feedback?

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
It looks like a lot of people like it tonight.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:53.000
So far, yeah.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
I've only heard maybe one little thing wrong with it,

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
and I'm pretty sure that's got to do with the database move

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
from the old website forums to the new one.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
And so that should be pretty easy to take care of.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
I was honestly thinking in the back of my mind

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
that the site would have to be reset.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Like I was like, okay, we'll just have to start over with the forums.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
You know, our news will probably have to start from square one.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:10.000
And I was like ready to accept that.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
And then when I looked at the new site today, I was like,

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:15.000
holy crap, he got everything migrated from the old site.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
That was pretty impressive.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.000
So props to you.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Oh, no worries.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:20.000
You know, it's my job.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
This is what I do for a living, so I'm used to it.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Yeah, so we don't pay you, so I mean, I hope the day job does.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Send you cookies.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:31.000
Yeah, we will send you a token of our appreciation, don't you worry.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:34.000
But what did you want to call in and talk to the listeners about tonight?

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
That was pretty much it.

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
I just wanted to get your guys' responses to the new website

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
and just find out what you thought.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:43.000
If there's any changes you wanted, just, yeah, that's pretty much it.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
We'll talk to you offline about some of the little stuff.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.000
I think we're going to write some new things to maybe replace some of the dated things,

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
even though you did copy them over from the old site.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:54.000
I think some things could use an 09 update, you know, like where the podcast is at and everything.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
But other than that, I mean, the site itself looks great.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.000
I love the idea of people sending in their own pictures.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
I hope people don't abuse that, so we have to lock it down.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Yeah, I'm going to keep track of that and make sure nobody kind of abuses it.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
I want to see cocks popping up all over the place.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.000
No cock shots.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Dar Sakura on break took a picture of me eating jelly beans just randomly

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
and uploaded them to the thing.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
So I don't know, what should I hold up?

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Oh, how about cookies? Let's hold up cookies for this,

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:20.000
and we'll send it right to the website right now.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:24.000
There you go. I just posted one of myself posing next to the website a couple of minutes ago.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Nice. Very nice.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:27.000
I like it.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Well, we're very excited about it, and we hope to have it launched maybe next weekend even or something, you know,

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
just as soon as we get some of our new authors on board,

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:38.000
because I know Tiara's getting ready to write some game reviews for us.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:41.000
I'm so excited, and we're going to have regular content again.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:44.000
I could just tinkle. I'm so excited.

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Awesome.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Not in here.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:51.000
All right. Well, Deke, thank you so much, and please send our thanks along to your family as well,

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.000
who I know have had to put up with you working on the site, and we really appreciate it.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
No worries. Take care, guys.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
All right. Take care, Deke.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Australians are cool.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
You know, what's funny is that he's actually living in Canada now, though.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Canadians are less cool, but okay.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:09.000
It's going to pass because you're there.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Well, he definitely still has the Australian accent, but I think it's a little bit of both.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Very cool. Very cool.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:19.000
A very international family one way or another, so we appreciate that.

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:22.000
He's an Australian guy living in Canada, listening to an American show.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
The Internet is an amazing thing.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
All right. That's going to do it.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.000
We are going to wrap up the show.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Sorry to those that didn't get through on Skype.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:33.000
I know a lot of you were getting through, but I also was very happy to hear some new callers get through tonight.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
That was pretty awesome, so thanks and shout out.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:39.000
Thanks to the guy who ate up all the time because his system was broken because he's using it in the shower.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
Well done.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:45.000
I think the Justin TV things actually kind of helped us get some new listeners,

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
so I'm really excited to get back on there.

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:50.000
I don't know. I don't think watching a radio show is that exciting,

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.000
but we'll see what we can do about the TV in the future.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Maybe we'll get a Switch box and actually play games.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
I don't know what we can do. We'll figure something out.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:03.000
I can fix it so the audio, you can hear everything next time.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:09.000
That's easy. Just splitter your speaker out and then into the...

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
They don't want to hear about the wires.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
We'll make it happen one way or the other.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
You guys got to see it in here. It's a wiring idea.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:16.000
It's awesome.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:17.000
They're going to take a picture.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:18.000
When I move...

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
So you can see what they go through so you can hear them.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:23.000
I can't live in this house forever because I'm a renter,

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:26.000
and someday they're going to kick me out or I'm going to want to actually buy a house.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
When I move, it's going to suck.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Anyway, that's for another time.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
This is going to be a three-hour show this week, but that's all right.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
First off, I want to say Matt, too.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Thank you so much for being here.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
I'm sorry you didn't get to say more tonight,

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
but we'll talk more about PC games in a future week.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:44.000
You will come back and join us again, correct?

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:45.000
It's Dan's fault, yes.

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:48.000
No, yes. I had a blast. Thanks for having me.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
PC gaming is more my niche, but yeah.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.000
Tell us, and we will do more PC gaming in the future.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
There hasn't been a lot this week, and we actually get the emails.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Why don't you ask to talk more about PC gaming?

03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:00.000
That's why I was like, Matt, too, probably sent one of those emails.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:04.000
It needs to come to the show a little more often.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
I do want to say, though, for the folks out there who listen,

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:10.000
who can't join us in studio, how is it different when you're listening to it on the iPod

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
and when you're here in studio?

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:16.000
It's actually a great way to kill two to three hours of my afternoon at work,

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
which is quite spectacular.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.000
Quality is good, easy access.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:22.000
How's it different being here live?

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:28.000
Oh, being here live? It's colder in the garage because my office is a balmy 72 degrees.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:32.000
It's definitely different. There's definitely a lot of wires around.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
It's a lot of fun.

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:40.000
At times I feel like I'm a little behind the times with all the wealth of knowledge that's in here.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
I feel like the noob.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.000
But when we started talking about WoW updates, I felt cool again.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:49.000
Dan's pointing at me. He's about to say something profound.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:50.000
We'll work on you.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:53.000
He says in the world of WoW, you are the king.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:57.000
Sadly, possibly, but no, there are people that out DPS in the tank.

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:58.000
In here anyway.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
In here? Okay, cool. I'll take that title.

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:03.000
Sometimes I hear a term involved. I'm like, I know what that means.

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.000
DPS, sweet.

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
No, I had a blast. Thanks for having me.

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:09.000
I look forward to next shows where you'll have room for me.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.000
Of course. Anytime, anytime.

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Dan, what can I say? Thank you so much for being here and bringing in your input.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
The chatters love you.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
They want you to be a regular guest on the show.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Please come back again, Dan. We had a lot of fun.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Even if, even if your wife is a little pissed, you keep taking her microphone.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Maybe we'll get two mics on the couch next time or something.

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:26.000
Don't bet on it.

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:30.000
All right.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.000
I am not pissed. It's just.

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:36.000
No, she's fine.

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:39.000
You are a butt face.

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:40.000
That's great.

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:44.000
He told her the mic was off.

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts?

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
Oh, I didn't even ask for last minute stories.

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:51.000
I'm such an asshole.

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:52.000
Last minute stories quickly.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:53.000
Dark Sakura.

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:58.000
There was a guy named Danny Johnson, 14 of grapevine, Texas.

03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.000
Shut up.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Who actually set a new world record in guitar hero at a Guinness world records event in Manhattan.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:13.000
He scored 973,954 points playing dragon forces through the fire and the flames.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:19.000
And from what I read otherwise, um, he actually broke a button while doing it.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:22.000
He broke his blue button and, uh, he was mad at himself.

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:23.000
He didn't hit a hundred percent.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
He only hit 99 percent.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:31.000
I'll link the video in the chat room.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
Loki, did you have any last minute stories?

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
Yeah, just some real quick stuff.

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:39.000
Namco is planning on rebooting the dead to rights franchise in, um.

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:42.000
Dear God, why?

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:43.000
I don't know.

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
Um, interesting, I guess.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:49.000
And then, um, some other stuff.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:57.000
Apparently some dude, uh, threatened to blow up the Bomberman devs because he had a problem with his Bomberman game, I guess.

03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:01.000
He had sent them 11 terrorizing emails during a four month period.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:04.000
He was at the company and finally decided to do something.

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:08.000
He was unhappy with the quality of Hudson products.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:09.000
He was just getting into the spirit of things.

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:10.000
I know.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
We have one more contribution.

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Mmm.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
Oh, jeez.

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:21.000
And then, uh, Telltale Games is bringing Wallace and Gromit to a PC and Xbox Live Arcade this spring.

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:22.000
I heard about that. It sounds awesome.

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:30.000
And then the last thing, and this is completely retarded, but, PlayStation 3 apparently is going to start supporting Ambiex.

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
What the hell is that?

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:37.000
Ambiex is a stupid little thing that you plug into your, it's, it's right now for computers.

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:43.000
It has, like, colored lights that change colors for, depending on the scenes that are in your, um, game.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:48.000
Then there's also, uh, fans that blow hot and cold air at you and it vibrates and craps.

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
Think about it. That could be cool.

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
Yes, and craps.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:53.000
And craps.

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:56.000
You can say, hey, this sucks shit.

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
And it's all, pfft.

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Wow.

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:03.000
That could be a feature in Excite Trucks 2.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:06.000
Now the Trucks crap.

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:13.000
I mean, why not? You can see those, you see those guys, like, that drive down the freeway and they have the balls hanging from their trucks?

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.000
Why not? Now they can crap, too.

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
Don't justify that behavior, Rob.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:21.000
I, well, I think that's the most vile thing possible.

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:24.000
If you have that on the back of your truck, take it off your truck and choke yourself with it.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:28.000
Um, seriously.

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
Please die.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:35.000
Also, I have one quick last minute story, or I'm gonna get the crap kicked out of me by you.

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:39.000
I'm gonna get the crap kicked out of me by Travis and John over at Undersedation Live.

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:44.000
Um, the, I believe they're down to like, I wanna say like 32 games, or 16, how many are they at?

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:47.000
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:51.000
They're down to like the top 32, I think something, games right now.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
Um, in the March Madness.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
There's just a shitload of polls right now on our forums.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:56.000
Make sure you vote if you haven't.

03:05:56.000 --> 03:06:00.000
I believe tomorrow at midnight is when the next round closes and it's gonna go on to the next round.

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
I'm sure somebody will post a link and chat there shortly.

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:05.000
And I wanna also apologize, I missed Travis' bachelor party.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:08.000
I was out of town last night and didn't get John's message until very late.

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:11.000
But we are sending Travis all our best here from Orange Launch Radio and Jenna.

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:14.000
And, uh, hope for the best for them for the future.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
Hugs and kisses.

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:17.000
So.

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:18.000
Finally?

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:19.000
Yes, yes.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
Oh my god, this is fantastic!

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
Yes, where have you been? Alright, yes.

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:26.000
Marriage is great, isn't it Dan?

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:30.000
It's more than I could have ever imagined.

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:33.000
And I mean that.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:39.000
Yeah, I guess they're doing the totally cliche Valentine's Day thing, you know, with this weekend coming up.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:45.000
We got engaged in theory on Valentine's Day.

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
Do you know what I did on Valentine's Day?

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Sat home and cried and ate lean cuisine.

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:51.000
That's what I did.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
No, I'm kidding.

03:06:53.000 --> 03:07:01.000
But ours was really cool and nerdy because we were watching UHF and eating French bread with spinach dip and drinking munch fries at Swine.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:07.000
I will say one of the coolest Valentine's Days I had was when the ex and I went to the Star Trek experience.

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:11.000
Or not the Star Trek experience, but the tour. We went to the Star Trek tour at Long Beach.

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:15.000
That was a pretty nerdy test at Valentine's Day, so, you know.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:19.000
Some people get married, some people boldly go where no man has gone before. What can you do?

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:22.000
Which kind of are the same thing.

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:27.000
Alright, congrats to Travis, sucker.

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:31.000
No, actually, Jenna's the real sucker, actually, in that relationship.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:35.000
No, we love him. Sorry I missed the bachelor party. I was out.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:44.000
But yeah, thanks to all you guys for tuning in and listening to us, whether it be on Justin TV or on All Games Radio or on the podcast when it gets updated, which will be sooner than usual.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
Well, now everyone knows what my home life is like.

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:57.000
Heck yeah. Alright. Quickly, final thoughts. I didn't get final thoughts. Dark Soccer, your final thought.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
You know what you're doing.

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:03.000
My final thought is Warpcore Breach, yum. Loki.

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:06.000
I need a Cage Man song.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
