16153	24292	A landmark Sony store says goodbye, Mario and Sonic get ported to the Winter Olympics, and is Namco Bandai about to acquire DJ Ranma?
31926	35430	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35471	40397	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
40477	48006	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me every week here in the OLR studios in Sacramento, California is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50779	52761	Who's feeling a little bit under the weather apparently.
53341	53582	Yep.
54182	55303	Actually, we're all under the weather.
55343	56684	It's one thing, one kind of common theme.
56704	57865	I'm above the weather.
58246	60088	I'm over it all.
60288	61189	I'm above the weather.
61309	62490	No one is above the law.
63330	65152	The weather is not the law.
65192	66193	The weather is chaos.
66293	68515	I've been kind of sick the past few days.
68936	70877	I had a horrible Valentine's Day because of it.
71438	73380	And Loki's a little bit sick as well.
74480	75521	Say hello, Techmaster Loki.
76321	78522	I'm a little sick and a little eating sandwich.
78562	79102	That's right.
80143	84985	And then some of the folks on Justin.TV are already commenting how messy the studio looks tonight.
85005	86265	Yeah, well, that's what happens when you're sick.
86285	87206	You don't really feel like cleaning.
87506	93588	Plus, we're presented in widescreen tonight, so you can see even more of the mess that is usually offscreen.
93608	95049	I was wondering why there's lightbox in there.
95549	96130	What's that?
96150	96890	I really didn't notice.
97315	98496	DanTheMan Hello Back for more
120921	126659	Yes, I have no place else I'd rather be You're lying, your internet's out at home, isn't it?
126799	127281	True that
128697	131898	Dan's internet's out at home, so, you know, he's here.
131918	132918	He's probably back on by now.
132998	133958	That's right, but you're here.
133978	134859	It's been nice talking to you.
134879	135159	With us.
136399	142961	Yeah, there's storms going on out in California right now, which is, you know, for most of the rest of the world, the storms here are actually pretty pitiful.
143141	149983	You know, compared to the rain they get, like, back east and stuff, but it's just not built out here to withstand some of the wind things we get.
150043	153184	So when we get a little windy, internet goes down left and right.
153224	153844	It's pretty sad.
154344	154784	Thanks for watching!
174830	175350	DarkSakura
193576	198457	I had a relatively busy gaming week despite school stuff.
201058	204559	I started playing City of Heroes this morning just on the trial.
204879	206119	I started playing with Sauce.
207260	209000	It was pretty fun.
209040	213841	I picked an electric power user who was a pretty cool character.
215142	219963	Of course, the most fun part is actually designing your character and making costumes and stuff, so that was pretty cool.
221684	231251	I also finished, well, I'm trying to think, what all did we play last night on the Genesis Collection?
232372	246242	Last night being Valentine's Day evening, my husband and I decided to do something super romantic and we played Xbox all night after I got us a lovely dinner prepared at Whole Foods.
247123	263012	So, we played a lot of Genesis Collection and some R-Type Dimensions, and I played some Symphony of the Night, and played a little, a couple of DS games, but I don't remember what.
263373	268656	Oh yeah, I downloaded and installed Perfect World, but I haven't started that yet.
268936	271898	So, I'm thinking City of Heroes is going to be the game of choice.
272952	274853	I've heard some interesting things about City of Heroes.
275053	277814	I think one of us OLR peeps needs to get on that and check it out.
278094	278634	That would be me.
278774	279174	Go for it.
281055	283456	Is Tiara on City of Heroes, or was that a while ago?
283496	284556	Oh, okay, cool.
284776	285796	Yeah, we played together today.
286236	292218	Because I know the new website's launching very, very soon, and we're going to have Tiara hopefully doing some articles for us there, so it'll be good.
292979	293819	Anything else for your gaming week?
294710	295610	Not that I can think of.
295730	296671	Then how about presents?
296911	297791	I like presents.
297871	298511	All right, some presents.
298531	301052	I'm going to show this to Justin TV before I give it to Jamie here.
301092	306953	So I got Jamie an authentic hula girl for her dashboard to match the one that Loki had.
307494	308534	So that's from Hawaii.
308594	311015	Even though these presents are like a month old, I'm just now remembering to give them to her.
311755	316336	And because I know Jamie's a tea drinker, I got her different types of tea that are very Hawaii.
316996	319777	One of them is a coconut macadamia herbal.
319977	320057	Ooh.
321049	322831	and the other one is Pineapple Waikiki.
323211	323952	Dude, that's great.
323972	324712	I love pineapple.
324892	325533	So there you go.
325573	328115	Some tropical teas there for DarkSakura.
328135	331157	I could totally use it because my voice is dying.
331257	331558	I know.
331598	334600	I'm almost kind of wishing I brought some more home for me but that's okay.
334620	335280	I have other stuff.
336842	342186	Loki, you already got your presents a few weeks ago so he doesn't feel left out but he got a matching hula girl.
342446	343867	Anyway, tell us about your gaming week, Loki.
346169	348831	You picked the perfect time when I have my mouth full of food.
350302	350722	DarkSakura.com
364400	368344	I'm playing around with modding the different files and seeing what that does.
369365	377733	So, I've been playing with making different weapons and I have, you know, the typical stuff, a weapon that has, like, way too much physical power.
378394	381897	So, you know, you shoot it into somebody and they bounce around like a ping pong ball.
383259	383339	Um,
383936	384456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
413453	417095	Actually, I'm on a couple of them, so I can try the multiplayer in that.
417235	426200	And if that's really good, then I may pick it up on all five consoles, and then that way we can play multiplayer in Lost and Damned.
426940	430702	Then other stuff I've been playing, I played the Killzone 2 demo, which is actually pretty good.
431663	435184	Very similar to Resistance, you know, as far as I'm concerned.
436865	439327	The game itself, not so much...
441556	454064	Not as hard as Gears of War, of course, although the game itself, the AI is very intelligent, it seems, so I can't just easily kill them or just run up on them and stuff like that.
455144	457426	But it looks cool, and I think it'll be very entertaining.
457586	465490	I'm not sure if I'm actually going to pick it up right away because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2, but maybe soon after.
467625	468266	Thank you for watching!
478524	482306	I'm no good at the game at all, so it was easy enough to beat on it.
482386	485507	Not as easy as some videos would make it seem.
486068	494612	You can't just go high-kicking everything around because the AI is smart enough to know, hey, I'm going to kick your ass now because you're just doing the same move over and over and over again.
495432	498814	Some people it works like the women with the long legs, of course.
500014	504597	It works pretty well, but it's not just like you put on auto-fire and leave the room.
505097	505937	They will kick your ass.
507967	508107	Helluja!
536002	543570	So if you like some of the English dubbing, then you can go ahead and leave it English, or you can just switch it to Japanese per character.
543650	544531	So that's pretty awesome.
544651	547554	That also has cutscenes and all the other stuff too.
548135	550197	So I thought that was really cool.
551759	553861	And then other than that, I mean, it's just kind of fun.
553881	555302	I was playing with some of the new characters.
555403	556484	Rufus is kind of funny.
556824	557104	And then...
558227	559588	El Fuerto is pretty cool.
559648	562750	Repeat what your wife said about Rufus because that made me laugh.
563130	568074	Yes, I was playing as Rufus and then Nelly's like, that looks like me but with blonde hair.
568094	569174	I'm like, come on.
569835	570856	That is ridiculous.
570996	572437	And Rufus is the big guy, right?
572477	574678	Yeah, he's the one that has his belly flab.
574818	577680	Nelly is one of the tiniest people I've ever met.
578401	580522	Her beard also totally isn't that impressive.
583904	584805	She was talking about herself.
585560	588661	No, Rufus is like me if I were to be in a fighting game, pretty much.
588761	597344	Okay, what I want to see now, I want to see Rufus versus... Okay, I'm going to go way back here, everybody.
597384	597564	Ready?
597964	599265	Raiden from Fatal Fury.
599645	600405	That's what I want to see.
601465	602085	I want to see that fight.
602105	603946	You just got to wait for the next round of crossover.
605207	606067	Or Chang from...
607253	608494	Ah, from Fatal Fury 2.
608834	609554	From Art of Fighting.
609894	611094	Oh, and Seth is a bitch.
611975	617437	Seth, the final boss, you know, who has, like, moves from all the other, you know, Street Fighter characters.
617837	618517	Yeah, he sucks.
619077	621158	Even on easiest, he's fucking cheap.
621298	623939	Let's get some comments from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
623959	625720	Chat is pointing out, you sound different tonight.
626240	627841	VSJSV says, Loki sounds weird.
627881	629121	TigerClaw says, you sound slightly deeper.
629141	630221	It's because I'm congested.
630282	631922	Yeah, he's been sick too, like all of us.
632222	634103	Literally every host in the LLR is sick tonight.
634123	634183	Yes.
634623	636104	It's my sexy voice.
636444	636944	That's okay.
637024	637805	I feel okay.
638785	640586	Just in time for Valentine's Day.
641927	646369	Loki wants you to get down this week with Street Fighter 4.
646409	651851	We have live women on the... waiting by their phones for your call.
656373	657514	Some comments are chat.
657554	659655	Leo Shen wants to know, how's Crimson Viper?
661241	662282	Death or Alive, Soul Calibur,
685658	687140	Death or Alive, Soul Calibur, Street Fighter
703857	705719	Rufus has booby physics Rufus has mooby physics
733243	735006	No, it's like gut physics.
735226	735968	I don't know.
736308	738192	Yeah, it's okay.
738252	741017	I mean, like I said, I'm no good at Street Fighter, and I don't
742011	745233	Pretend to be, you know, winning any arcade game.
745253	750636	I mean, hell, I lose to the computer on easiest sometimes, so that's pretty bad.
750977	754139	You just need to do what I do with Chun-Li and just hit the kick button repeatedly.
754159	754679	It doesn't work.
755179	761743	Even on easiest, the computer would be just like, okay, you stop doing stuff, I'm going to walk over and punch you now.
762084	763885	No, they're actually, it's pretty hard.
764185	768608	I don't know if it ramps up based on how well you're doing, but, you know, easiest isn't
770172	783141	TigerClaw in chat says every time I hear the word Rufus the first thing on my mind is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures I was thinking Rufus Shinra but I watched that pretty recently alright
784802	787544	Okay, so if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I'll talk about mine.
787604	789025	Mine was pretty much the same as Jamie's.
789065	793509	I played a lot of the new Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection, except I played it for the PlayStation 3.
793609	797752	They didn't have it on 360 when I went, and I actually was thinking, you know what?
798153	802476	For the classic games, I think I'll want the D-pad on the PlayStation 3 controller, and why not?
802516	807740	I don't have a lot of games that offer trophies, so if I feel like being an achievement whore on the PS3, why not?
807780	808280	It makes sense.
808721	809321	So I picked it up.
809822	812304	And I'm pretty sure I'm getting the exact same freaking...
812864	813405	Thanks for watching!
819659	821420	But overall, the game collection is pretty awesome.
821440	822741	I mean, you cannot beat the value.
823101	829926	It's $40 for, what, no, sorry, 40 games for $30, and then like 9 unlockables in there.
829966	831647	And some of the unlockables are pretty awesome.
831947	837290	You get some arcade games like Altered Beast, Fantasy Zone, Shinobi, which was awesome.
837610	844415	And Dan had pointed out a fact I didn't think of before the show, but they have never released an official port of Shinobi Arcade for the home systems.
844455	845155	I mean, you had the dub down.
845175	846456	There have been lots of Shinobi ports.
846816	850799	Right, but not the authentic arcade version.
850839	852900	Like, a lot of them were dumbed down for the 8-bit systems.
852940	859224	Like, they had Shinobi on the NES from Tengen, if I remember right, but it was pretty dumbed down, you know?
859684	860305	It was different.
860365	863987	At least they tried to at least emulate the actual arcade version.
864107	869611	Do you remember Ninja Gaiden on the NES was completely different from Ninja Gaiden Arcade, but for the better in that case.
869731	870091	Way better.
870231	870611	Way better.
871152	871392	Anyhow.
871872	877436	Random tangent, but I just remember being a kid, like it was Shinobi over here, and Ninja Gaiden over here, or like the two big ninja games he had.
877896	878537	So, anyhow.
880098	881039	The collection is great.
881459	882700	It's definitely worth the money.
883360	890205	A slight disappointment that they didn't do more with the online functionality, especially when they've had us buy this collection before on the GameCube.
890546	895669	And these, you know, or I shouldn't say the same collection, but you know, Sonic games at least, all bundled together and so on.
896170	899052	Little disappointed that they didn't do at least leaderboards.
899552	903034	Online multiplayer, something that brought in the extra functionality.
903054	903335	Who knows?
903635	904736	Downloadable games.
904896	905256	Why not?
905276	912581	I mean, we all noticed Revenge of Shinobi was missing from the collection and some other big Genesis titles from back in the day are missing completely.
912961	915262	So why not have these as like download content?
915362	916783	That would be actually kind of rad.
918004	919885	But I somehow doubt that's how they're going to do it.
919945	920386	Why should they?
920406	928771	They released Sonic 1 and they released... Didn't the original Streets of Rage come out for download 360 and one of the Sonic 2 was download content for Xbox Live Arcade?
929092	930061	Streets of Rage 2 Dead
930727	931408	Street Trades 2, not 1
960490	961751	That's the reason to have a CDX though.
985502	986664	for more games.
986804	988186	Because there's no CD games in this.
988547	989348	No Sewer Shark.
989368	991371	It's just small and easy.
991872	992953	Or Nomad, you know.
993614	997400	Maybe that's the next Sonic's Ultimate CDX Collection.
997721	999103	And we'll have freaking Night Trap.
1000936	1004059	You really want to play the Dana Plato game?
1004119	1006541	I don't know why I want to play the Dana Plato game, but I do.
1006561	1007582	You know what games though?
1007622	1009524	There's Microcosm and Sewer Shark.
1009584	1010945	Microcosm I actually liked.
1012767	1014408	There was Dragon's Lair.
1014688	1016170	Where's my Jaguar collection?
1017778	1020059	Where it should be, non-existent.
1020119	1021019	It would just be Tempest 2000.
1021059	1023180	It would just be Tempest 2000, that's all.
1023220	1024061	That's pretty much it.
1024321	1026482	I think there was one other good Jaguar game I can't think of right now.
1027203	1027623	Defender?
1028523	1032645	Going to comments from chat, Acidic Vampire says they need some tougher achievements in that collection.
1033066	1039849	Yeah, the achievements are a little easy, but again, that's why online leaderboard at least would have been cooler so you have something else to obtain.
1040890	1042451	Yeah, the achievements are a little easy.
1042591	1043691	They're a little on the easy side.
1043731	1045993	Some of them will take you a little bit of determination to get...
1047974	1048835	Yeah, it was on the easiest.
1048875	1049556	Same thing with the trophies.
1049576	1051178	The trophies and achievements are the same thing.
1051238	1056483	It's just that on the PlayStation, instead of worth points, they're worth either bronze, silver, or gold, depending on what it is.
1056804	1058866	But I unlocked a gold trophy easy.
1058926	1061188	I got the Sonic Spinball.
1061529	1063190	Now, maybe it's just because I love Sonic Spinball.
1063231	1066374	For whatever reason, don't laugh, but I got 10 million points on Stage 1.
1066534	1067095	That's all you have to do.
1067115	1069037	And that's like beating Stage 1, pretty much.
1069497	1070198	We'll get you that.
1070218	1073260	This is probably unlikely, but can you combine games together?
1073280	1077302	Like, you know, with Sonic Spinball and all the Sonic games, you can do the Sonic and Knuckles stuff.
1077923	1078523	Sadly, no.
1078743	1081245	And actually, you couldn't do that with Sonic Spinball, I don't believe.
1081305	1081645	Yeah, you can.
1081745	1082626	You can play as Knuckles, yeah.
1082646	1083927	You could do Blue... No, you couldn't.
1083987	1085648	You could do Blue Sphere.
1085688	1088369	Yeah, there was something, I think, like one little extra thing it gave you.
1088389	1089710	No, you can play as Knuckles in Spinball.
1089730	1090191	No, you can't.
1091785	1092426	I don't think you can.
1092566	1093166	I thought you could.
1093526	1094267	I thought you thought wrong.
1094307	1101891	My Genesis collection, which I mean is not a CD for my Xbox, but is a box full of Genesis crap, is sitting by my TV.
1102031	1105433	If you want to come on by, we'll walk on.
1105573	1106813	But you get something with it.
1106853	1107394	You get something.
1107414	1107954	You get the blue.
1108494	1110836	Just like all the other games, it does the blue sphere game.
1110956	1111956	Not even the complete one.
1111976	1113477	I think it's only with Sonic the Hedgehog.
1113617	1114978	That's kind of dumb.
1116584	1117305	But interesting.
1118587	1119007	Let's see.
1119327	1121530	I'm still looking at comments in the chat room.
1121570	1123853	GameGuru says it was Sonic 2 that gave you Knuckles.
1124614	1127277	Yeah, some of them gave you the extra character.
1127938	1128199	All right.
1129480	1130562	I guess that's it for Gaming Week.
1130602	1134166	Unless, Dan, you want to... I don't know if you played some stuff that Jamie didn't that you want to share with us.
1134206	1135508	But, Dan, do you have anything?
1135993	1137414	I've played nothing new this week.
1137854	1139535	I'm still playing HD Remix.
1140295	1141716	I played R-Type Dimensions.
1142696	1145377	And I played Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.
1145978	1147258	For Shinobi, mostly.
1148179	1149119	And here's what I have to say.
1149519	1151020	Online leaderboards suck.
1151700	1152661	I don't know why you like them.
1153441	1159124	All they do is serve to remind me that the games that I think that I'm good at, I really, really suck at.
1159264	1160766	But it gives you something to work towards.
1161206	1167493	All I know is go to the online leaderboards for R-Type Dimensions and see the people who have beaten that game without dying.
1168194	1170476	Every one of those people I want to kick in the balls.
1172116	1173416	I thought I was good at R-Type.
1173656	1174737	I am no good at R-Type.
1175017	1175617	I hate you all.
1176077	1177197	There was some game.
1177357	1181738	It was the Midway Collection, I think, one of the first that came out, and it had online leaderboards.
1182198	1191721	And, like, for a while, I was in the top ten for Wizard of War, that old-ass 80s game, and that made me feel pretty cool, even though, like, nobody probably fucking played Wizard of War.
1191821	1194981	I dominated Road Blasters on that and the Xbox for months.
1195441	1195762	See?
1196122	1196342	See?
1196382	1196862	They can be fun.
1196902	1197362	But you know what?
1197382	1198782	Eventually, somebody owned me.
1199282	1201503	And that person, when I find you...
1202243	1202343	Nice.
1202363	1202464	Nice.
1228647	1231729	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1231749	1233490	There's a couple things on the table right now tonight.
1233870	1237232	If you are listening to us live on allgames.com or on JustinTV, hello.
1237512	1239353	Hello, by the way, again, to the JustinTV listeners.
1239373	1241014	You can look at us on camera at JustinTV.
1241134	1247017	I don't know why you'll want to watch a radio show, but that's what the listeners asked for, so we gave it to them.
1247077	1249299	Keep in mind, we still don't have our issue fixed where...
1250299	1254682	You can hear all the sound that goes out over air, so you only hear what goes through the microphones.
1254702	1255723	You don't hear any of the music.
1256123	1258185	I forgot to bring the adapter for that.
1258265	1259246	It's not a huge deal.
1259286	1259926	It's not a huge deal.
1259946	1262948	I would hope that everybody's still at allgames.com to get the full experience.
1263228	1265790	But I know there's some people that because of firewalls and stuff, they can't.
1266090	1271955	So they have Justin.TV, which seems very odd to me that you would be able to watch Justin.TV, but whatever.
1272195	1274376	Some people have claimed that happens, so it's interesting.
1274797	1276318	But that's interesting.
1277165	1278226	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1298263	1300925	That's going to happen live tonight during the show a little later on.
1301185	1305889	They're just crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's right now while we're taping.
1306309	1308150	So in the meantime, you can still join us at chat.
1309011	1311793	There is still a link on OrangeLawnTrader.com to go to our chat room.
1311833	1313514	That is not being affected by the site outage.
1313534	1315015	Just check out OrangeLawnTrader.com, okay?
1316716	1320197	Some folks in chat sharing their online leaderboard experiences.
1320857	1325878	Actdeft says, I was at one point in the top 20 users in championship mode of Pac-Man CE.
1326238	1327059	That's a tough one.
1327739	1328659	That is an achievement.
1328699	1329639	That is an achievement.
1329659	1330920	Achievement unlocked.
1331680	1335040	You have a big EP for that one because that is not an easy game to be doing that with.
1338317	1344200	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news and all that and talk about what's new in the gaming world this week.
1344460	1345541	Are you done with your sandwich, Loki?
1346041	1347602	No, I'm not done with my sandwich, but that's okay.
1347642	1349443	Alright, we'll make it work anyway.
1349483	1350503	The show must go on.
1351664	1352484	With or without sandwich.
1353244	1354385	Oh, let me say this real quick.
1354465	1358147	I'm going to give a quick shout out to our buddy Brad from PodCulture.
1358207	1360628	He started a new podcast for that show Dollhouse.
1361569	1362709	I meant to watch that.
1362809	1364050	I did watch it.
1364910	1365991	Joss is the man.
1366351	1369813	Hopefully he has more listeners than there were viewers for The Dollhouse.
1369853	1371354	Ooh, did it not do well on the ratings?
1371374	1376577	No, it lost to Super Nanny, and I will have to say, I was part of the Super Nanny crowd, unfortunately.
1376597	1379039	You know what, though, hopefully... Rude.
1379439	1381780	They just can't screw this up the way they did Firefly.
1382041	1391386	Hopefully it'll make up some viewers from TiVo and iTunes and all that stuff right now.
1391406	1392487	It's just, it's on a bad night.
1392527	1395769	I mean, most people don't stay home and watch TV on Fridays.
1395789	1395989	Well,
1396129	1404552	The whole problem is that they screwed up Firefly so bad that people are going to have a bad impression of those who never went back to watch the DVDs.
1404632	1406273	I mean, Joss is the man.
1406353	1407133	I mean, I'm serious.
1407153	1410475	If you put this show on any other day in the week, I think you'd be fine.
1410495	1411095	Seriously.
1411796	1417621	Fox does have this tendency to give Josh Whedon the death spot on Friday nights.
1417901	1427711	Not to knock Fringe, because I love Fringe, but if you want this show, if it's kind of tanking for you guys, why don't you just throw Dollhouse right after American Idol?
1428551	1430173	That way you get a really big lead-in.
1430393	1431453	Hopefully they will one night.
1431593	1433014	They'll give it a shot after American Idol.
1433034	1434934	I don't know, because the show was pretty decent.
1434954	1435775	Look, let me put it this way.
1435895	1443277	I know I'm like the gay guy you hear on the podcast or whatever, but seriously, if I was straight, Elijah Dushku, you betcha.
1443697	1444237	You betcha.
1445178	1445878	She is pretty hot.
1446098	1447158	She's very hot.
1447178	1448539	Yeah, that's happening for real.
1449879	1452080	So anyway, I didn't give the website.
1452180	1453540	Support our buddy Brad's podcast.
1453600	1456661	It's thedollhousepodcast.com if you're a Whedon fan.
1456981	1459062	You should check that out and support that show.
1459582	1460465	But Joss is owned.
1460706	1462210	Buffy just doesn't strike twice.
1463193	1465339	He hit too big too soon.
1465419	1466562	It's all downhill from there.
1469508	1470448	Firefly was awesome.
1470589	1471549	Ten times better than Buffy.
1471709	1473691	And it got screwed off of TV.
1473831	1477133	So, I don't see what the fans are hoping for.
1477193	1482097	Brad's actually saying in chat, we started a Deadpool on PodCulture about how long it'll take Fox to axe it.
1482657	1485239	That's pretty morbid, but sad, but true.
1485459	1497148	I know there had been talk about them actually doing a Faith spinoff, but this was a different idea, and I think that it was that he and Eliza Dushku came up with the idea together, so...
1497788	1498888	Honestly, the show's not bad.
1498928	1504310	It was a little hard to get into because I think the first episode kind of hits the ground running, but it's not bad by any means.
1504350	1505451	Put it on SyFy.
1505471	1506091	I mean, shit.
1506551	1511033	They just got, you know what, reruns of, you know, some Stargate spinoff.
1511093	1512833	I mean, seriously, just put it on there.
1512853	1514334	Yeah, but Stargate Atlantis was crap.
1514854	1516975	All right, look, we got to get into gaming news.
1517055	1518875	We suddenly have turned into the nerdy podcast.
1518955	1519295	Sorry.
1519396	1521896	We don't want to infringe on pod culture's territory.
1523857	1524817	Excuse me, what?
1525378	1525998	Turned into?
1526769	1527289	You know what I mean?
1527369	1527669	Alright.
1528289	1529990	I watch a lot of TV during the week, okay?
1530030	1530850	That's true.
1530950	1531250	You know what?
1531310	1535012	Ever since I stopped playing WoW, I have watched a shitload more TV than I used to.
1535032	1536552	I would never have watched Dollhouse.
1537112	1540813	Before it used to be, okay, House and Nip Tuck or whatever.
1540873	1543714	Now it's like eight shows I'm watching.
1543754	1544815	It's like too much.
1544835	1546775	But anyways, Amazing Race starts tonight.
1547075	1547495	One show.
1547615	1548116	Tivo it.
1548596	1549276	Supernatural.
1550615	1552236	I watched Wife Swap last week.
1552256	1553296	That's how pathetic I was.
1553356	1556037	Not Super Nanny, but Wife... I actually watched Wife Swap, then Dollhouse.
1556718	1558538	We don't, like, watch Super Nanny religiously.
1558578	1561820	It's just, if it's on, it's like... Sorry.
1561880	1562440	So, hey.
1562660	1563940	Rob, got more news for us.
1563961	1565521	Loki wants to start us off with a story tonight.
1565721	1566121	Alright.
1566782	1567002	Well...
1568082	1588301	After all the assumptions that the viral video wasn't necessarily a viral video, or was a viral video but just not leaked out, apparently that video that was out last week showing zombies in a Las Vegas type of setting with a giant atmosphere and stuff like that,
1589142	1590703	Yes, that was actually Dead Rising 2.
1591223	1597045	And Capcom did announce Dead Rising 2, which will be coming out on PC, 360, and PS3.
1597746	1600887	It will take place in a brand new city.
1602708	1603808	Well, Fortune City.
1604189	1605529	It's kind of like Las Vegas.
1606189	1607810	And it will be a gambling paradise.
1608330	1611792	No longer will you be playing Frank West, but some guy in a jacket.
1612272	1613793	And there's... Boo!
1614093	1614693	Boo to that.
1614793	1615273	I'm sorry.
1615353	1616434	Frank West is awesome.
1617955	1619137	But has he covered wars?
1631147	1631467	Maybe.
1631787	1632727	But see, here's the thing.
1632847	1633908	And will it blend?
1634508	1638149	We're only talking like four screenshots and everyone's assuming that Frank West is not there.
1638409	1641970	Maybe Frank West is there, but maybe there's two-player co-op.
1642130	1643430	Maybe it's multiple characters.
1643450	1644411	Maybe it's multiple characters.
1644431	1644811	Maybe he's a zombie.
1644831	1645431	I know, I know.
1645511	1646431	I'm not giving up hope yet.
1646451	1649772	And he's like the super zombie and you have to run over him with a riding lawnmower.
1650182	1651523	Dead Rising Chop Till You Dry
1671135	1672237	After playing the 360 version.
1672277	1673739	But they have new costumes in there.
1673759	1678905	The entire fun of the 360 version is taking pictures while you're doing these horrible things to the zombies.
1678925	1681028	I know, but they took that out of the Wii version.
1681048	1681448	I'm sorry.
1681468	1685213	I wish they had patched that for two-player co-op, same screen or something.
1685253	1685614	I don't know.
1687452	1693055	Talking about TV shows in the chat room and video game potential, Acidic Vampire suggests Super Nanny the game.
1693895	1694215	I don't know.
1694495	1697157	I get the sense that would just be Imagine Babies or something like that.
1697717	1699778	What the hell is Super Nanny?
1699978	1706801	It's this show where they call the 800 number, the producers of the show, if their kids are just out of control.
1707801	1709382	You should watch this show because it would piss you off.
1709402	1711003	So this is Mary Poppins modern day?
1711023	1711123	Yes.
1711363	1714664	Yes, actually, the lady's name is Joanne or something.
1714704	1717445	She's from Britain, so she has the accent and everything.
1717485	1722827	She even carries a little umbrella, and she comes and she restores harmony to the household.
1723007	1725827	You know how to restore harmony to a household with unruly children?
1725927	1726108	What?
1726368	1726948	Duct tape.
1727648	1728128	Ceiling.
1728168	1737071	Basically, this last episode that I missed Dollhouse for, it had this guy, this abusive dad, who's slapping his kids and stuff.
1737091	1737591	He's like, what?
1737671	1739512	You can't slap the baby.
1739792	1742174	That's not the way to raise your baby.
1742614	1743855	And it's like an hour of that.
1743895	1746176	You cannot slap your baby.
1747157	1750078	I'm so glad I don't watch that show because it sounds retarded.
1750098	1751639	It's just frustrating.
1751719	1755541	And you know the thing that pisses me off the most, Rob, is watching people be stupid.
1756929	1767533	That's why, like, I think your own personal hell would be shows like... Like, you'd be strapped to a chair, forced to watch this, and Wife Swap, and... I don't know, some of these feel-good reality shows.
1767553	1769254	That would feel good my ass.
1769314	1772395	Watching people be stupid is the worst form of torture ever.
1772435	1773315	Do you know what I like to do?
1773335	1775696	I like to watch The Biggest Loser while eating.
1776590	1777831	Oh my god, now that would be great.
1801701	1801961	I know.
1802582	1803863	Sugary goodness.
1804403	1804584	It is.
1804684	1806045	Anyway, I'm sorry.
1806485	1807606	We need to get back to gaming news.
1807866	1808627	Can we please?
1808887	1812751	One place I will not be eating ice cream ever again at is the Metreon.
1813491	1815533	And we know the Metreon here at Orange Lawns Radio.
1815553	1817735	We actually have a lot of very fond memories of the Metreon.
1817975	1822019	I have no memories of the Metreon other than it used to exist because I've never been to the Metreon.
1822039	1822579	Hold on, let me say it.
1822659	1827143	The Metreon is not closing, but the Metreon has gone through a lot of changes in the past few years.
1827183	1828805	For one, it's not owned by Sony anymore.
1829425	1840215	And the reason why I say the Metreon holds a special place in our hearts, the very first Dance Dance Revolution tournament, if you've been listening to this show for any length of time, you know DarkSakura, Loki, and myself, we all met playing DDR at the arcade.
1840695	1844339	The first Dance Dance Revolution tournament I ever went to was at the Metreon.
1844747	1849789	And do you remember that we went to the Metreon the day we decided to do the radio show?
1850189	1851509	That's right.
1851569	1853470	OLR was born on a trip to the Metreon.
1853810	1854210	It was.
1854590	1856191	The third mix that was half-faded.
1856671	1858091	No, fifth mix that was half-faded.
1858212	1858972	Yep, I remember that.
1858992	1860292	Because it had been halfway in direct sunlight.
1860312	1864954	At that cool little arcade, and that was when they had the little Oops, I Went to Hell store or whatever that chick was.
1865494	1868555	Oh, I can't remember the name of the... Oops, I Went to Hell store?
1868795	1874241	No, the chick was on all these shirts that say, Oops, I just ran over something.
1874301	1876103	Or, Oops, I had sex with your boyfriend.
1876123	1877965	That was like the little niche on all these shirts.
1878366	1880268	And I just remember getting one that said, Oops, I went to hell.
1880749	1880849	Oh.
1881009	1882110	I don't remember the name of the character.
1882130	1882831	It wasn't an Emily character.
1883812	1884372	I don't think so.
1884693	1884973	I don't know.
1884993	1885573	Anyway, forget it.
1885954	1888535	But I've seen Nightmare Before Christmas there twice.
1889036	1890437	Yeah, they have the IMAX theater and everything.
1890657	1891898	Well, now it's owned by Westfield.
1891958	1893179	That happened a couple years ago.
1893259	1894500	It got changed over.
1894560	1896841	But here's the thing is that they still have the Sony store.
1897362	1898522	Well, guess what?
1899223	1906828	Apparently, in an interview with GameSpot, Sony has said the lease for the Metreon for the PlayStation store will expire this summer.
1907289	1908810	We have chosen not to renew it.
1908850	1911452	They are saying the lease expires on March 31st.
1911532	1912833	So the Sony store is going...
1913393	1914233	to be closing.
1914293	1915854	It's kind of sad in a way.
1916214	1917475	I mean, it is and it isn't.
1917575	1922476	I mean, the Sony store was a little overpriced and glamorous and everything.
1922536	1929599	I mean, well, they charge the same price you'd pay in any store, but they didn't really have sales or anything like that going on there.
1929659	1931420	Everything was very high-end or whatever.
1932280	1936462	It was very nice, but it was still kind of nice that Sony had an official place.
1936602	1937062	You know what I mean?
1937942	1942565	And they did all their launch parties there, and there were some Final Fantasy things that went on there.
1942705	1943405	It's kind of sad.
1943805	1945566	It is the end of an era, in a way.
1947588	1960295	Anyhow, by the way, speaking of the launch parties, Sony has apparently said they are still always looking at new avenues for additional retail exposure in space, but they felt it best not to continue with a dedicated PlayStation store at the Metreon at this time.
1960335	1965738	Again, if you haven't caught on yet, the Metreon, right off of 4th Street in San Francisco.
1967406	1968727	I'm going to be closing.
1968747	1970449	The Sony store is closing, not the whole thing.
1971450	1976214	There are a couple of other notable things about the Metreon apart from having a pretty decent arcade there.
1976914	1982119	There is the video game Walk of Fame.
1982759	1983941	I don't know if they still have that.
1984141	1985222	I thought it was still there.
1985322	1985862	It was their...
1987965	1988385	I don't remember.
1988405	1990306	I thought it might have changed hands when it went to Westfield.
1990706	1991266	But I'm not sure.
1991426	1993547	This was there since it changed hands.
1993707	1993947	Was it?
1994067	1994307	Okay.
1994907	1996347	I haven't been since it was Sony.
1996687	1997988	It's been a couple years since I've been.
1998008	1999428	And it was still Sony last time I went.
1999588	2001829	I went not too long ago.
2001889	2002829	You could tell the place was hurting.
2002849	2005009	Because this was right when the first arcade they had closed.
2005750	2006810	It was empty.
2006930	2007510	It was.
2007610	2008350	It was hurting.
2008790	2012131	I mean, this was a couple years ago before everybody said the economy was going to crap.
2012171	2014172	And now, you know, just double that with...
2015226	2019370	Dragon Quest X would cause problems for the release of Final Fantasy XIII.
2039146	2045449	Um, well, they really, it's just that they can't, um, really be sure if it's going to affect it or not.
2046069	2051612	But Dragon Quest IX is going to be, um, delayed from March to July.
2052532	2055674	And they don't know if that's going to cause Final Fantasy XIII to get pushed back.
2056854	2060516	Um, it's actually supposed to be out, um, in Japan this year.
2061437	2066559	And, um, over here and in Europe next year, um, sometime around April 2010.
2066599	2066699	So...
2068780	2077763	It was also reported that 3D Realms mentioned that the delay on Dragon Quest X also is going to be delaying Duke Nukem forever.
2078863	2079804	Oh, gee!
2080804	2082445	Even though the games have nothing in common.
2083185	2085306	Hey, it's very much in common.
2085386	2086566	Both are going through delays.
2086586	2092348	But there is, though, a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy XIII out, so look for it and see.
2092805	2093446	Another new one?
2093486	2094947	Or is this the same one that was out a couple weeks ago?
2094967	2096948	I think it's the one that's been out for a couple weeks.
2096968	2100050	The one that shows some of the battle and CGI.
2100270	2100450	Yeah.
2101291	2101611	So, yeah.
2103032	2103853	Boy, oh boy.
2103913	2105994	Just when Final Fantasy XIII needed another delay.
2106014	2106835	The slimes, Rob.
2106875	2107596	Slimes.
2107776	2111038	Well, at this point, though, I'm just kind of used to it.
2111198	2113760	It's just like Final Fantasy XIII, it'll be out when it's out.
2114220	2114620	I take that back.
2114660	2118143	I don't think it's Dragon Quest IX or Dragon Quest X. It's IX.
2118343	2118683	It's IX.
2118703	2120064	That's why I said Dragon Quest IX.
2120345	2122306	Oh, I said X. Never mind.
2122577	2125940	Dragon Quest X will be delayed until 2012.
2126621	2127702	Yeah, X is also delayed.
2127742	2129564	I'm sure X will be out eventually.
2129604	2132526	So therefore they can't start working on X. Makes perfect sense to me.
2132707	2134008	I bet you anything X is on the Wii.
2135029	2137171	Or whatever, maybe Nintendo's next system.
2137211	2140334	Because the last Dragon Quest game that they had on the Wii was so awesome.
2140794	2141415	I'm just saying.
2142436	2144638	They'll go for wherever the big market is.
2145339	2145659	We'll see.
2147884	2150505	Well, then the next Dragon Quest game would be in my pants.
2150585	2153127	That's the biggest market out there.
2153267	2154027	Oh, shush.
2154267	2156629	I don't want to know about that because of slimes.
2156709	2157089	Yeah.
2159430	2163572	So anyways, Activision has talked about their 2009 lineup.
2165509	2166109	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
2189460	2196021	And then, of course, Prototype sometime this year, probably around June.
2196942	2201042	And you better believe that there's probably going to be tons of freaking Guitar Hero games.
2201682	2203283	Because they already said there's going to be a ton.
2204383	2205523	Yeah, there probably will be a ton.
2206323	2207664	I don't think they're going to renege on that.
2211744	2214085	But only half the company is going to E3, right?
2214625	2214845	Yes.
2216260	2218604	There's no Blizzard in this Activision Blizzard.
2218804	2223532	Which doesn't make any sense to me because you're one company, you can't have half your company not go.
2224440	2230963	No, they can get away with it because everybody knows about Diablo 3 and StarCraft 2, which is we all know what Blizzard will be showing, so what the hell.
2230983	2232503	Nobody wants to see those.
2233524	2234524	Well, they know.
2234604	2235605	Everybody already knows about them.
2235625	2236565	They don't need to know.
2236605	2242567	Guitar Hero Greatest Hits or How to Run a Franchise into the Ground Without Ever Even Really Trying.
2242587	2250751	Well, I think the reason why they're probably not going to be obviously going to E3 is because then if they show all this stuff off, all their big announcements for BlizzCon will be ruined.
2250831	2251791	Because they're going to PAX.
2252412	2253372	No, they're going to BlizzCon.
2254505	2256879	And seriously, if they shorted E3, it has to come out.
2256919	2258246	You know, like StarCraft Ghost.
2262132	2263553	I'm looking at some comments from chatroom.
2263593	2266374	TigerClaw is talking about the whole Dragon Quest thing.
2266734	2269135	Yeah, because Dragon Quest made you jizzed in my pants.
2269835	2271856	A little reference to the Saturday Night Live sketch.
2272336	2272596	Get it?
2272936	2274496	Their album just came out.
2274717	2275817	I'm on a boat.
2276237	2279698	Can you imagine though if Dragon Quest X really was in Loki's pants?
2279798	2281179	A wild schlong approaches.
2287101	2287841	Oh, jizzed in my pants.
2289481	2291142	I'm selecting run.
2295324	2300326	Well, something that has run away, far, far away, is the release date for Guild Wars 2.
2301447	2301907	Sad.
2302687	2306669	I know, Guild Wars 2 originally was supposed to be out in 2008.
2307069	2307570	Remember that?
2307590	2309330	It was supposed to be out in 2008.
2309410	2311631	I remember 2008 like it was last year.
2311692	2312212	Yes, it was.
2312572	2316794	And then it got pushed back, and now it's been pushed back 2010 to 2011.
2319315	2322379	is the new time frame for when Guild Wars 2 is supposed to be out, if you can believe it.
2322619	2323960	That's a huge release window.
2324301	2325922	I'm assuming that's sometime in the fiscal year.
2326223	2327764	They're saying probably April 2010 to 2011.
2328225	2330167	Let's wait until people have jobs.
2330668	2332570	Or forgot what Guild Wars 2 is about.
2332670	2332970	I don't know.
2333691	2336354	I got devastated on Kotaku for saying it doesn't matter.
2337970	2339231	Nobody buys Guild Wars.
2339491	2341172	The people who play Guild Wars care.
2341613	2343114	Nobody new is playing it.
2343955	2346677	It's not WoW, so nobody cares.
2346697	2352641	The people playing Guild Wars are the people that bought it way back when it came out so they didn't have to pay the monthly fee and they're still playing it after all this time.
2353061	2362889	But I think their new subtitle to Guild Wars 2 will actually improve their client base.
2363429	2366091	Guild Wars 2 now with Rampant Nudity.
2367578	2368759	Ooh, naked.
2370701	2371742	Big booby adventure.
2373023	2375505	How about something a little bit different?
2375645	2380389	I just want to say real quick, though, the delay possibly because of the layoffs that NCSoft has just had.
2380790	2383272	And to note, they're also skipping E3 this year.
2383372	2386115	So, you know, NCSoft kind of has some issues going on anyway.
2386715	2388117	Going out of business.
2388837	2391400	Let's hope not, because there's a lot of Guild Wars fans that will be very upset.
2391880	2402583	Just as long as, if they go out of business, they better release the standalone City of Heroes player creator for all the updated outfits and stuff.
2402903	2406585	Okay, I just want to say though, like at PAX, I remember we were live one night.
2406605	2409365	Remember how we did the whole all games thing live at PAX and we were all at the table?
2409385	2410686	I'm sorry, Rob, I don't remember that.
2411406	2420890	You need to dig through the memory banks and find it because I remember one night we were sitting at the table and there was a line coming out the door for the panel and one of them had to do with Guild Wars.
2421430	2426913	I distinctly remember it was a Guild Wars panel because I think we were making fun of Guild Wars a little bit while all the people were in line and getting scowled at.
2427613	2433015	But of course every panel at PAX had a line going out the door and around and down the stairs so we had captive audiences.
2433595	2435536	The piracy one was hilarious.
2435856	2436857	Yeah, anyhow, sorry.
2437788	2445420	I almost pirated the game during the piracy panel I remember Loki trying to do that he was trying to pirate a game during the piracy panel just to be ironic
2447762	2449203	You're such an ass, Loki.
2449443	2450244	Sorry.
2450784	2451625	Jackassery.
2451805	2452205	I know.
2453106	2457069	So, how about people who are Warhammer 40k fans?
2457569	2461732	Which is not me, because I get tired of the stupid little figures.
2462693	2473061	Sorry, for our listeners who don't know, I had a bad experience with an ex who was addicted to Warhammer 40k and his stupid, retarded little lead figures and having to paint them, but I'm not bitter.
2473641	2484388	My sister's ex actually is really into Warhammer 40k and he does paint the figures and he also LARPs and also plays Vampire the Masquerade.
2484528	2486470	I LARPed but then I grew up in Berkeley.
2486510	2488711	I just want to point out, our wife swapped this week.
2488992	2489712	It was a LARPer.
2490993	2491173	No.
2491413	2494375	They swapped with... What, what?
2495316	2496557	Blood figures are tasty.
2500940	2502501	This explains a lot, actually.
2504175	2508398	This is why Dan's not allowed to eat anything that I don't approve of first.
2509739	2526353	Anyway, so they're working on a beta now for, well actually they had the beta out for Dawn of War 2 and that it has already prompted a big massive patch of
2526913	2541067	Lots of changes to go into the game, so it is supposed to be going through, so if any of the beta players can actually say anything about it, and I'm sure there's NDAs and whatnot about that.
2541127	2543168	Good, they need the patch, since it comes out, what, like...
2544810	2545530	Next week?
2545710	2546971	I mean, seriously.
2547011	2547371	Who knows?
2547411	2549993	We might be seeing a delay if it's big enough.
2550113	2559399	But it had to be enough that if they're going to... In fact, actually, I think this is kind of a fun quote put out by Relic.
2559860	2561841	Sometimes we just make mistakes.
2561921	2563422	We're only human after all.
2564023	2567765	But other times there are very good and well thought out reasons behind the changes.
2567865	2569766	Oh, we forgot to put legs on the goblins.
2569866	2570747	Now they can't move.
2571027	2571368	Shoot!
2571488	2571888	Naked!
2571908	2572008	Naked!
2573615	2574555	How about a hug?
2574755	2576236	We're only human after all.
2577416	2578437	I want them to leave in naked.
2578457	2579817	We are the world.
2581558	2582118	You know what?
2582558	2582858	What?
2584438	2585579	It's Warhammer.
2585659	2588920	Just go play with the lead figures instead and make real friends.
2590460	2591241	Eat the lead figures.
2592721	2593001	Nice.
2593461	2597363	Seriously, get out of your house and go... Eat some lead figures.
2597823	2598023	No.
2598343	2599303	They're not candy.
2600924	2601244	I know.
2602267	2603167	See, that's what they should do.
2603267	2605108	Warhammer 40k gummy figures.
2605429	2609510	Then that way when you destroy their army, you can literally bite off their heads.
2609530	2611491	Yeah, you're just like, oh, battle damage.
2612812	2613893	Why don't you just use goldfish?
2613913	2616254	That would actually be a pretty awesome type of role-playing game.
2616274	2620256	Like, I want to come up with a role-playing game that's like Gummy Bear Warfare or something like that.
2620276	2620476	You could!
2620516	2620876	Why not?
2620896	2621996	They have fuzzy heroes.
2622077	2623517	It would be awesome.
2623577	2624538	Fuzzy heroes.
2624758	2626058	The game you use with stuffed animals.
2626379	2628159	Out of Jell-O Wigglers.
2628920	2629220	TM.
2630197	2634279	Oh my god, I want to create my own role-playing game now that involves me eating.
2634599	2636019	It's got to play like Advance Wars.
2636039	2638460	I have to figure this out.
2638480	2641041	You can totally make it out of chocolate shell and ice cream.
2641221	2645663	Or even better, a role-playing game that's comprised completely with snack food.
2645963	2648324	And you have to build units with different snack foods.
2648364	2650225	DarkTetsuya says, OLRPG.
2650945	2652065	I'm starting to like this idea.
2652986	2654146	Add it to our dream games.
2654226	2659832	Yeah, I was going to say, maybe our dream game company can not just make console games, but will make tabletop games too.
2660192	2663256	And OLRPG will be all based around food.
2663416	2665918	Actdeft suggests Fat Princess with RPG elements.
2666139	2666960	Yes, I like this idea.
2667000	2668121	It's Fat Princess for real.
2668761	2669342	This is a good idea.
2670864	2671905	I approve of this thought.
2673322	2680064	Apparently there's a new game coming out that was revealed during Nintendo of Japan's Fall Media Conference.
2681045	2684966	Of course, it wasn't really a big title.
2685046	2686547	It's a game called Kensax.
2687027	2693609	And what this is, it's actually a first-party game that is tied with a search engine.
2694290	2697571	Basically, you have different games that are in there.
2698231	2701373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2721064	2728108	of words with a 3x3 board, and you conduct different search terms, and whoever finds the highest hit count wins.
2728648	2732070	And then they have some that are finding a certain amount.
2732470	2734151	Plus, you can also update it, I guess.
2734652	2737833	It has a library of 3,000 words, and you can add more to it.
2738293	2744217	And then, of course, you go online to increase the vocabulary plus...
2745618	2746439	Update search results.
2746559	2749441	I would think if anything had sex or porn in it, you're going to win.
2749781	2752003	This game sounds stupid and boring.
2752203	2762631	It sounds like something that you do when you're at work and you're on a firewall connection where they've locked out anything good and all you can do is just find something to amuse yourself.
2763592	2765213	That's exactly what this sounds like.
2766334	2766974	Dan's got it.
2767254	2769056	Yeah, I know all about that.
2769656	2773039	This is so bad, it makes me want to punch myself right in the face.
2775461	2775841	Let's see.
2776281	2777482	Punch yourself in the face.
2777542	2779343	How many search results do we get from that?
2781464	2782485	At least six.
2782805	2787247	The question is how many results down do you have to go before you actually hit porn?
2787567	2788648	Punch yourself in the face.
2789068	2790269	265,000 results.
2791889	2792270	Porn?
2792310	2793290	How many results for porn?
2794291	2796051	245 million for porn.
2796432	2796992	Porn wins.
2797532	2798633	The internet is for porn.
2799298	2800819	How about boobs?
2801079	2803041	Only $60 million for boobs?
2803101	2803721	What's up with that?
2806063	2809186	Because one thinks if you've got porn, boobs come with it.
2809346	2810467	I mean, seriously.
2810747	2812808	Where there's porn, there's boobs.
2814009	2817592	Hey, where there's Mario and Sonic, there's bound to be the Olympics!
2819374	2823597	Of course, Mario and Sonic at the Summer Games ended up being pretty much a sleeper hit for Sega's
2823937	2828899	So it's probably no surprise that Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games is official.
2829239	2838382	And Sega did announce it earlier this week that Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic will once again compete on the Wii S and the DS in Vancouver.
2838642	2839242	The Wii S?
2840143	2841423	I said the Wii and the DS, right?
2841643	2843384	You said the Wii S and the DS.
2843804	2844404	Ah, works fine.
2844844	2845125	The Wii...
2847509	2853092	The Wii S in Vancouver is where, of course, the 2010 Olympic Games are being held.
2853552	2859895	And just in case you want to know how big that first Mario game was, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, the first one, 10 million units globally.
2860775	2865797	By the way, the new one, the Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games, it's going to support the Wii Balance Board.
2866758	2870539	Some of the events that will be in it, speed skating, alpine skiing, so on and so on.
2870599	2874061	No news about curling, but I hope to hell they do not forget curling.
2876843	2877404	So there you have it.
2877444	2879045	Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics.
2879065	2880747	You know, they are making a deck of Sporta 2.
2881667	2882148	Are they really?
2882388	2882588	Yes.
2883489	2883609	Nice.
2883629	2888213	We need to branch the whole and Sonic out to the Olympic Games to other mascots.
2889014	2891336	Like Master Chief and Sonic at the Olympic Games.
2893418	2897662	A game guru suggests the next game should be Mario and Sonic at the Special Olympics.
2899644	2900345	I don't know about that.
2901547	2903187	That might be it.
2903468	2904448	I don't think that got picked up.
2904548	2905828	Dan was off mic.
2906168	2908729	Yeah, Dan said it had to be Tails and Toad.
2909989	2911510	At the Special Olympics.
2912030	2915251	All the characters there, everybody doesn't care about anymore.
2915351	2917231	Actually, Toadette.
2917271	2918312	I can't stand Toadette.
2918472	2920672	Toadette definitely is in the Special Olympics game.
2921392	2926114	They need to do an evil one with Waluigi and Shadow.
2928574	2928854	Nice.
2928894	2930575	Trying to destroy the Olympics.
2933351	2934291	Okay, sad trombone.
2936452	2937193	Sad trombone.
2937453	2938293	Hey, release dates.
2938333	2939073	Happy trombone.
2939374	2940274	Actually, can I do a plug?
2940534	2940694	No.
2942075	2943255	Of course you can do a plug.
2945396	2953760	Just because I am true to my word, I would actually like to plug a website that...
2955791	2968284	My only teacher this semester happens to have, because I know that we've got other designers and people listening to this show, so I did want to go ahead and give his website a little plug.
2968865	2974671	If you go to mehallo.com, it's M-E-H-A-L-L-O dot com, go look at his fonts.
2974731	2975111	They're great.
2978172	2980773	See, was that painless?
2980813	2981833	Wait, spell that again?
2982593	2984794	M-E-H-A-L-L-O dot com.
2984854	2985674	I put me hello.
2987174	2987794	Oh, okay.
2988255	2989855	He has some very excellent fonts.
2989875	2990755	He designs fonts.
2991475	2992095	Oh, very cool.
2992476	2996377	So, you know, we have a new webpage on the way.
2996577	2997077	That's right.
2997797	2998237	Very nice.
2998817	3002158	So, how about release dates, Rob?
3002657	3003597	How about release dates?
3003977	3008418	Well, those are the games that stuff is released on, huh?
3009038	3010439	Anyway, how about the 20th?
3010639	3015380	Because that's really the only date this week that we've got stuff coming out in the UK.
3015980	3016320	We have 50!
3017720	3020601	50 Cent Blood in the Sand on Xbox 360.
3020721	3024022	Oh, the hell with Street Fighter 4 then if this game's coming out.
3024182	3024882	Oh wait, this is Europe.
3026357	3029079	On 20th, Cryostasis on PC.
3030700	3037065	More, we have Elodies, The Adventures of Kai and Zero on DS.
3038026	3039787	Men of War on PC.
3040368	3044031	So I guess it's, you know, Sexy Man Calendar and Camo Speedos.
3045812	3046552	Necrovision.
3046753	3047913	Okay, that just sounds kind of gross.
3047974	3049355	Necrovision on PC.
3050255	3052177	Race Pro on Xbox 360.
3052697	3054058	Sega Mega Drive Collection 2.
3055707	3056447	on PlayStation 3.
3057968	3062069	Street Fighter 4 on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3062829	3067270	And remember, in the PlayStation 3 version, you get Ken.
3069151	3070871	A figure of Ken in the U.S.
3072152	3072612	A Ryu.
3073012	3074252	Oh, which one's the one we got Ken?
3074653	3075113	None of them.
3076253	3077453	Oh, it was Ryu, never mind.
3079214	3080454	No, we had a conversation about that.
3080794	3082635	Oh yeah, and also that Warhammer piece of shit.
3083280	3084121	Reviews better anyway.
3084642	3085142	Hell yeah.
3086023	3089527	Of course, Dan will argue with you until he is red in the face.
3091550	3093332	Ken's cooler, just because he wears red.
3094493	3097096	Which is why I said red in the face, not blue in the face.
3097597	3099659	But yeah, that Warhammer crap comes out too.
3101922	3103103	Not a big Warhammer fan, are you?
3103570	3106313	Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon
3122122	3125084	or actually, wait a second, today's not the 16th, my mistake, that's tomorrow.
3125665	3126905	But still, close enough.
3128006	3132730	Dragon Quest V, The Hand of the Heavenly Bride will be coming out on DS as well.
3133790	3137393	Prinny, can I really be the hero on PSP?
3137793	3140255	Oh god, this is that game they keep telling me I need to play.
3142881	3148663	Warhammer 40,000, Dawn of War 2 coming out this week as well on PC.
3149884	3157527	That's not your sort of thing, then Disney's Sing It High School Musical 3 will be coming out as well on all four systems.
3158387	3161248	Race Pro on Xbox 360 will be coming out as well.
3161869	3166070	And then the big one, Street Fighter 4 coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3167591	3170313	Battle Rage, Sonic World Adventure, Shooting Love, Triangle Service
3196840	3224078	I am not you cannot you cannot make this stuff up and it is a shooting game just so you guys know there's the cover it looks like it's like a compilation of other games or something I'm not sure but probably it looks like it's those old school type of shooting games that are so popular in Japan Sonic World Adventure as well Star Ocean The Last Hope for those of you Star Ocean fans what the hell is Sonic World Adventure Sonic World Adventure is I believe it's Sonic Unleashed yeah over here
3225638	3226939	Then... Ah!
3227539	3232580	I just closed my release dates trying to look up that Sonic thing for Loki.
3233300	3235421	I want to say, yeah, Star Ocean as well on the 360.
3236121	3242442	By the way, they are releasing a premium pack, an Xbox 360 with Star Ocean coming out in Japan over there as well.
3242662	3250825	And naturally, they are getting a Street Fighter 4 as well from around the world, although I believe the Japanese release just came out for them actually this past week.
3251945	3252045	But...
3253746	3258768	A lot of Japanese stores are going to be importing the other country's versions for collectors.
3259688	3262930	PlayStation 3, Sonic World Adventure also comes out over there.
3263210	3265151	Otherwise, not a lot on the PlayStation 3 this week.
3266412	3271574	Nintendo Wii, Metroid Prime with Wii controls is coming out in Japan this week.
3271975	3274636	Dead Rising, they're calling it Zombie no Ikine.
3275016	3277017	That's the Dead Rising chop till you drop over here.
3277477	3280339	Sim Animals also comes out on the Nintendo Wii this week in Japan.
3280939	3284200	on the PlayStation 2, Biohazard Code Veronica Complete.
3284220	3285420	That would, of course, be Resident Evil.
3285920	3289001	Sacred Blaze is a big game coming out this week from Flight Plan.
3289881	3293542	And that's pretty much what you got coming out on the PlayStation 2.
3293642	3295202	Taking a quick look at the Nintendo DS.
3295662	3299363	Locke's Quest this week, Saru Saru DS, Sim Animals as well.
3299763	3302623	Simple DS Volume 46, if you can believe it.
3302663	3304704	The Hikkyo Takentai...
3305464	3330406	Shotoko Special and Shining Force Feather is the big release from Sega this week on the DS and lastly on the PSP Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories gets a price reduction Idol Master SP Perfect Sun looks to be the other big release Perfect Sun, Wandering Star and Missing Moon all come out from Namco Bandai on the PSP this week in Japan
3331135	3336199	Remember the good old days when the PSP got games and wasn't just used to emulate old consoles?
3336599	3339202	Yeah, but Idle Master is a huge thing in Japan.
3339542	3342384	I don't think it caught on over here, but it's... Really?
3342664	3344125	I don't really know how you would describe Idle Master.
3344145	3345046	It never came out over here.
3345126	3347889	I was totally looking forward to that new Idle Master game.
3347949	3353133	Isn't it like a take on American Idol type thing, but it's not actually a singing game?
3353193	3356495	You guide your contestants through these games somehow.
3356556	3356916	I don't know.
3357216	3357977	It's like a sim game.
3357997	3359978	There was a game that I used to have on...
3362441	3362702	What?
3364970	3366234	He's talking about something irrelevant.
3370309	3372970	Anyway, I was actually talking about Dreamcast.
3373010	3376152	It was a game called Super Producers that I never got very far in.
3376672	3382636	But the way that it was is there were different mini-games in it that you would manage a pop idol's career.
3383096	3387279	I don't think it sold very well over there, though, even.
3387399	3388780	But it was a weird game.
3389000	3394763	I'm telling you, you need to bring back, on the PSP, C&C Music Factory make the video thing.
3395083	3395664	Heck yeah!
3397374	3398015	or something.
3398475	3401017	Some other type of make the music video game.
3401257	3405360	Dan was talking though about a Clicovision game that was here.
3407881	3409362	I don't recall.
3410423	3411203	Manager game?
3412084	3413365	Maybe a football manager game.
3414626	3415306	I remember those guys.
3415366	3416967	I had one of those on the Commodore 64.
3417007	3418989	Of course I didn't know what the hell I was doing because I was like 7.
3420009	3422451	Anyhow, let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news.
3423131	3424092	That's going to do it for release dates.
3424502	3426283	Well, Midway.
3426923	3430965	You know, weren't we just, like, singing the joys of Midway last week?
3431825	3438508	I don't know if you'd say the joys, but... Well, we were talking about how, you know, Midway was the, you know, pretty cool.
3438628	3439728	Especially back in the day.
3439748	3444230	Like, their arcade collections will really show you, like, how awesome, you know, they are.
3444330	3447731	But they haven't had a lot lately going for them, but Mortal Kombat.
3447871	3449212	Even more than that now.
3450052	3451933	They have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
3453050	3467319	Sad Trombone But basically the CEO, Matt Booty, I'm trying not to laugh, said that it was a difficult but necessary decision.
3468320	3477446	Basically, for those who don't know, Chapter 11 gives you relief from your creditors so that you can regroup and get your financial plan back together.
3478486	3479727	So, I won't.
3480566	3492389	Some of those creditors that they owed money to, at the tune of $281 million in liabilities, and of course they only have $167 million in assets.
3493210	3496110	Wells Fargo Bank, they owe $150 million to.
3496590	3505333	National Amusements, they owe close to $20 million to, and apparently they paid for the manufacturing costs during the
3506574	3516862	for Midway's holiday lineup, NBA Properties Inc., almost $17.3 million in licensing and royalty fees, Warner Bros.
3516902	3530053	Interactive, $6.6 million, and Epic Games, $1.975 million for licensing and royalty fees, probably for Unreal Tournament.
3532602	3535903	It's kind of interesting that they are doing so horribly.
3536043	3542766	I also read another story that apparently somebody had purchased controlling shares of Midway for only $100,000.
3543266	3549268	So some dude out there owns like 80% of the company now with $100,000.
3549628	3550989	The mystery investor.
3551529	3551769	Yes.
3552449	3557331	They inherited like millions and millions of dollars in debt.
3559016	3563258	and basically paid virtually nothing for tons of the rights.
3563318	3564999	But yeah, it's like the mystery investor.
3565579	3570682	Well, supposedly he's supposed to be protected from the debts, but he's still going to make more than $100,000 on the deal.
3570762	3574284	Oh yeah, because he's going to get all the rights.
3575524	3577685	Then he's going to make Mortal Kombat out of his basement.
3579526	3582107	Mortal Kombat versus the Care Bears or something.
3582127	3584228	Mortal Kombat versus your mom.
3585069	3585289	Nice.
3588014	3590998	This doesn't mean, though, that Midway is shutting its doors or anything.
3591098	3593181	It just means it's not a good sign.
3593221	3593942	They might as well.
3594483	3596826	Just sell Mortal Kombat to somebody else.
3597387	3603235	Really, other than Mortal Kombat, there hasn't been a lot that they've put out lately that's been any good.
3604472	3606653	That's not the purpose, though, of the Chapter 11.
3606693	3612577	The Chapter 11 is meant for a company that they see recovery in their future.
3613157	3615398	This just gives them momentary relief.
3615559	3622202	Well, I have to say, though, what I think of when I think of Chapter 11 in this day and age is, like, remember what happened with Mervin's, the big clothing store chain here in California?
3622603	3625664	Mervin's filed for Chapter 11, and not even a week later, they were gone.
3626085	3628066	Like, the liquidators were coming into town.
3628106	3630167	So you have to worry a little bit.
3630207	3632488	Like, I know it's still a preemptive step, but...
3634161	3642490	Yeah, Chapter 11 bankruptcy basically gives a company a chance to come to terms with its creditors and arrange alternative financing.
3642510	3645013	And if the financing's not out there, they're hosed.
3645613	3647555	Circuit City closed down after being in Chapter 11.
3648476	3656085	I mean, if you go back to like the 80s, I mean, this is 80s style, Worlds of Wonder, who made like Teddy Ruxpin and Laser Tech.
3656445	3657146	Thank you for watching!
3672594	3678537	And if only they had combined Teddy Ruxpin and Lasertag together, they would have been an unstoppable force.
3678837	3679777	I bet you they did.
3680077	3685820	I bet you that somewhere at Worlds of Wonder there was a Lasertag that you could, like, shoot at Teddy Ruxpin and he'd be like, Stop.
3686080	3686480	Stop.
3686580	3687381	Aren't you my friend?
3687441	3689201	Were they the ones that made My Buddy?
3689582	3690162	My Buddy.
3690282	3691282	No, that was Galoob.
3691302	3692383	Oh, okay.
3693203	3694304	What happened to Galoob?
3694344	3694584	Are they...
3695546	3697587	Micromachines, they made Micromachines too.
3697968	3702371	Galoob I think got bought up by Hasbro or Mattel or somebody significant.
3702671	3706714	Yeah, I think they're still making Micromachines and those are Galoob as well if I remember right.
3706934	3710617	I actually think Micromachines are now put out under the Hasbro label.
3710777	3711097	Wow.
3711397	3712318	No, they probably bought it up.
3714960	3717822	If it doesn't say Micromachines, it's not the real thing.
3718302	3720524	What ever happened to that guy that talks really fast?
3720584	3721384	Is he still alive?
3721404	3722005	He died.
3722365	3723366	No, he's alive.
3723789	3727831	I always get him confused with the guy who is the Scatman.
3728571	3728791	Yeah.
3729311	3730192	That guy died.
3730212	3730992	John Machida.
3731012	3731232	Sorry.
3731252	3731793	Isn't that his name?
3731873	3733073	I get them mixed up.
3733133	3735874	They not only look similar, but you know... Scatman Crothers.
3735914	3738976	The Scatman guy looks like the Micro Machines guy.
3739556	3739976	Oh, I see.
3740016	3742337	You mean the one from the video.
3742357	3742757	That one.
3743198	3743858	Scatman Crothers is...
3746579	3747679	Am I crazy?
3747759	3752761	Surely people remember the Scatman song.
3753241	3754862	Give us some more stuff, Rob.
3755582	3763025	Speaking of companies and all this crazy bankruptcy and whatever's going on, this isn't bankruptcy, but it's an acquisition.
3763365	3766786	Apparently Namco Bandai is looking to acquire D3.
3766866	3770468	They're going to buy all of D3's stock, apparently.
3770548	3771048	This is a
3771668	3787558	Namco has already apparently made some deals with the board over at D3 they're going to have a 70% stake in the company I guess they already have it they're going to purchase the remaining 30% at about $680 a share they're going to have controlling interest in the Naruto property
3788298	3791139	Uh, doesn't D3 also make Onichimaru?
3791540	3798843	Yeah, they do a lot of the ports of the simple series games, which really, I don't know who the Japanese companies are that make these, but they need to pump out more of them.
3799103	3801264	I want to see Zombies vs. Ambulances over here.
3802565	3803846	Remember when Namco was great?
3804926	3806187	Now they're just watering it down.
3806767	3810929	First they poured in a big bucket of Namco, or a Bandai, and I mean...
3812245	3812746	NAMCO Bandai
3823777	3851174	and it's funny you bring that up because they're actually saying that D3 could benefit from especially the Bandai arm they make the toys, TV, arcade they make all this other stuff, movies and stuff that could actually maybe help D3 that maybe we could get, I don't know, Oni Chambara the TV show that would be kind of awesome actually bring the movie over that's right maybe we could get some Bikini Samurais in Tekken there you go that'd be kind of cool that'd be very cool
3852365	3857332	Why can't we have another Klonoa?
3858073	3859034	Remake to Wii or something?
3859054	3859675	Yeah, it's coming out.
3859735	3860736	We need new Klonoa.
3861357	3862598	Next few months, May, I think.
3862759	3863740	Klonoa's awesome.
3864020	3864401	Very nice.
3865322	3867405	Well, how about more acquisition news?
3870342	3875450	You know, Squeenix is trying to make a purchase.
3876451	3881158	And Squeenix has done a lot of things that have made us go, what, over.
3881799	3884023	But they are trying to purchase Eidos.
3886648	3895772	And they're trying to basically buy it for more than it's worth using 129% over their current market value.
3897472	3901654	So we're looking at grabby, grabby Squeenix.
3902974	3905175	We're looking at 80 style takeover.
3908516	3910917	So they want it.
3911057	3911898	They're going to get it.
3912078	3913358	You know what Squeenix does.
3914459	3914959	It's ours.
3917148	3926852	However, I do have to say that Kotaku is my hero for using a picture of dead Eris to advertise this.
3928212	3933554	So that makes me quite happy.
3933634	3944778	Kind of an interesting merger, if you think about it, with the whole Tomb Raider series kind of going... I don't know, what else does Eidos have over there?
3944978	3946899	I can't remember some of the other big stuff they publish.
3947560	3950361	Hitman, if there are any more of those.
3950741	3952781	They have Just Cause coming out at some point.
3955042	3956142	Well, Just Cause 2 at least.
3956862	3960823	Interesting, because those are the types of games Squeenix never really seems to get involved with.
3960863	3966305	So that would be a very interesting sort of merger, especially if Squeenix is really wanting to get into the Western development or whatever.
3966725	3969486	You guys are killing me with this Squeenix thing, by the way.
3969646	3969886	Why?
3970006	3970806	It's Squeenix.
3971626	3972626	We like to call it Squeenix.
3972907	3974367	The goddamn company's called Enix!
3975538	3976058	You're killing me.
3976098	3977600	You're killing me.
4002218	4003999	I guess you might get Psygnosis out of me.
4004019	4004560	Kanan Lynch!
4004700	4005460	Woo!
4005620	4006340	Woo!
4006440	4007701	Kanan Lynch, yeah!
4007721	4009402	Then they have, what is it, Battlestations?
4010122	4014645	I think that series, so the Battlestations Pacific or something is coming out.
4015745	4018107	Yeah, it's nothing that's really exciting.
4018287	4020588	You know, Tomb Raider is kind of what they have.
4021248	4023329	And like I said, maybe Hitman?
4023690	4029273	Although you gotta wonder about the viability of the Hitman franchise, because they didn't even bring out a game to go with its really crappy movie.
4029893	4030013	Um...
4031255	4033157	What are you going to do with that company?
4034137	4035018	Tomb Raider RPG?
4036399	4037480	I don't know.
4037860	4040002	Maybe it would save the franchise a little bit.
4040582	4043604	AlphaCanadagram in chat suggests it's called Square Anus.
4044265	4049489	Don't even guess on NX, because NX is an awesome company.
4049569	4051991	And Square used to be great, too.
4052051	4055513	It's the bizarre combination of them that just has fallen into RPG hell.
4055593	4057555	Remember when Square made Einhander?
4058195	4060596	Remember when Enix made fucking Actraiser?
4060776	4062357	Yeah, and Enix made Actraiser.
4062397	4065138	And Illusion of Gaia and that whole series.
4065439	4066759	You know, Secret of Mana.
4066819	4068240	We need another Tobal game.
4068380	4068940	Bust a Move.
4068980	4070361	Tobal, Tobal number one.
4070401	4071281	Yeah, Bust a Move.
4071362	4072482	Enix made Bust a Move.
4072702	4075103	You know, those companies used to make great games.
4075163	4080326	Now it's just rehash old RPGs, bring out new crappy JRPGs, you know.
4080726	4081547	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4103803	4105324	and then they danced their way out of it.
4105444	4106484	That game was awesome.
4106504	4107825	That game was beyond awesome.
4107845	4110326	I love the fact that one of the attacks was that Strike would shoot at you.
4110366	4113187	In fact, I just gave you... We should play it right now.
4113267	4118229	Squenix, I gave you the new tagline, Bust a Move 3, Beyond Awesome.
4118889	4119690	Bust a Move.
4120470	4122091	Dance or bust a cap in your ass.
4122171	4123091	Bust a cap.
4124451	4125652	You got served.
4126172	4129574	Ranma says, God damn it, Square Enix, I want Rad Racer 3.
4129834	4132695	Yeah, Rad Racer rules.
4134108	4136790	Only if it has 3D when you hit the select button.
4136930	4140153	Yeah, and you've got to be able to change the tracks and the Nintendo music has to be there.
4140714	4144877	Which in this day and age, it might actually be kind of doable with this whole stuff they're talking about 3D.
4144897	4145397	Can you imagine?
4145637	4152543	Remember when they were talking about that the Wii's top secret thing was going to be 3D projection in your room and all this fucking bullshit?
4152563	4154324	Why did we ever believe that fucking shit?
4154705	4160790	Because that would be super awesome and really innovative and then they're like, no, we don't want to do that.
4160870	4163592	People love to give Nintendo way more credit than they deserve.
4164893	4166255	Anyhow, forget it.
4168398	4170441	Let's get into some other stories.
4170821	4171142	Sorry.
4172023	4177010	Because remember, it's only good for Nintendo to innovate unless it will benefit their casual audience.
4178849	4179149	Yes, indeed.
4208709	4209370	GameFly vs. Total Access
4229048	4229649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4247546	4248247	Blockbuster had streaming.
4248267	4248827	That would be ultimate.
4248847	4249908	The Netflix streaming is awesome.
4268342	4273263	There is a rumor, though, that they're going to somehow incorporate this into the PlayStation Network.
4273483	4275124	Oh, please let this be true.
4275324	4280625	So I don't know if that's actually going to happen or not, but it's rumored that maybe they're thinking about it.
4280765	4285406	Sony can't do anything that cool anymore, so don't bet on it.
4285746	4287406	Sony will find a way to screw it up.
4287586	4289647	I wish they would prove you wrong on that.
4289687	4293728	It would be great, though, if you were walking around at home and you could walk up to your TV and turn it on.
4294608	4296852	and your total access menu would come up.
4297533	4300498	Or I could just bypass that whole bullshit and just hit a button.
4300859	4304064	You could make your dude sit down and watch it and look bored.
4304445	4305467	I think that'd be awesome.
4306368	4307510	And then smoke a bowl.
4310106	4312867	Watch Cheech and Chong on Bloodbuster.
4313247	4318428	It would be really interesting if they had context-sensitive reactions.
4318488	4320909	So if they watch a sad movie, they'll sit there and cry.
4320969	4326110	If they watch Cheech and Chong, they'll sit there and neck-toke, which would be hilarious.
4326270	4327591	Not likely, but hilarious.
4328051	4329291	But I just think that would be pretty cool.
4330612	4333915	Yeah, somehow I don't think that would get by like the Sony sensors or what have you.
4333935	4336397	Well, I don't think the smoking dope thing would happen.
4336458	4339060	I think that, you know, having your little dude watch TV.
4339120	4339621	I mean, come on.
4339981	4342583	A bajillion freaking people play The Sims.
4343064	4345306	So, you know, they watch their Sims do nothing.
4345366	4346307	I don't want that.
4346647	4347748	Home bullshit.
4347948	4348588	Don't use it.
4348608	4349268	You don't have to.
4349288	4350929	I'm saying it would be cool if it was there.
4351529	4352189	God damn it.
4352249	4353050	You're missing the point.
4353070	4355991	Just so I could see it that one time and go, wow, that's fucking cool.
4356051	4356611	Okay, I'm done.
4356751	4357291	There you go.
4357492	4357832	All right.
4358092	4358412	I see.
4358432	4360653	It's like a stream saver for your life.
4360753	4365455	It's called how many millions of dollars does Sony have to spend to get me to say, wow, that's fucking cool.
4365635	4366095	Next.
4366435	4370097	Well, if it makes someone say, wow, that's fucking cool enough for me to buy a PS3.
4371177	4371738	I mean, come on.
4371838	4374459	How many systems has Nintendo sold with the controller?
4375379	4376240	for the Wii.
4376260	4378141	People are like, ooh, I can wave my hand.
4378201	4378702	This is great.
4378842	4379242	Oh, wow.
4379322	4381264	It really sucks for actual gameplay.
4381844	4382885	That's really sad.
4385387	4385848	I don't know.
4386108	4386909	I don't know what to tell you.
4388971	4393215	But yeah, you can look for that blockbuster thing coming soon, I guess.
4393696	4394376	Hopefully.
4394436	4395077	Or is that now?
4395137	4396198	That you can do the game thing now?
4397279	4398941	I think it's very soon, if not now.
4399061	4402664	I kind of want to do that, but I still want Netflix, too, for streaming.
4403025	4404026	Just... Quandary.
4404646	4405267	I don't want both.
4405387	4406008	It's too much money.
4406628	4406869	Anyhow...
4407509	4410270	or just, I don't know, go rent a movie.
4410670	4411270	Here's the other thing.
4411330	4420712	Here's what you got to do is if you change your address or whatever, like Hollywood Video will send you a bunch of these like, you know, welcome to the neighborhood and rent a free game or free movie thing.
4420952	4427614	My sister has like moved apartments in her complex a few times and she's got like a ton of those things and she keeps bouncing from different Hollywood videos.
4428174	4430196	because I'll let her do it over and over and over again.
4430376	4436341	Or if she hasn't read anything from a Hollywood video for a while, they'll eventually call her and say, hey, do you want a free rental?
4436381	4437522	Come back in the store type thing.
4437882	4440845	So she bounces between three different Hollywood videos and they keep sending her those.
4441585	4441866	Nice.
4442246	4446289	That sounds like entirely too much effort to save the five, six bucks.
4446310	4447270	She's poor, so yeah.
4447491	4448171	She doesn't care.
4448331	4449432	She's poor, so yeah.
4449472	4450033	She's poor.
4450053	4451634	Entertainment, however I can get it.
4452615	4452895	All right.
4454258	4458322	Hey, the DS Lite Onyx version, that would be the black one for most of us.
4458362	4459023	Call it the black DS Lite.
4459043	4460044	Why does it have to be a black thing?
4460204	4461525	Apparently, shut up.
4461645	4464468	Apparently, it has been discontinued.
4464528	4466850	Nintendo is keeping the black system down.
4466890	4469032	That is the rumor going on.
4469953	4472696	And Loki is confirming it's happened.
4473437	4476239	Nintendo is discontinuing the Onyx DS Lite.
4476780	4477881	I have a rare system then.
4478001	4479001	Black DS Lite.
4479181	4480342	It's going out the door.
4482042	4483402	Yeah, the only four colors left.
4483862	4488984	Metallic Silver, Metallic Rose, Black and Cobalt Blue, and Black and Crimson Red.
4489304	4494745	Pink, Pinker, Pinkest, and Very Pink are the four colors that are left of the DS.
4497906	4498086	So...
4500126	4509548	Is this because maybe there's like, you know, and this is kind of the thought process going around, that a DSi is coming relatively soon-ish, and that the DSi is going to be black?
4509808	4513089	Not necessarily, because they did the same thing with the white DS.
4513129	4519430	I think it's just after a while they just want to stop making, you know, a certain color.
4519730	4521071	You know, I don't know.
4522171	4525032	Because five colors is too many, but four is just right, I guess.
4526052	4526452	I guess.
4527796	4532978	DarkSakura has dug through the Classic Game Archive, I'm assuming with Dan's help a little bit this week, and has picked one game to highlight for you folks on the show tonight.
4532998	4533718	What game have you picked?
4557287	4562030	Today's game is The Revenge of Shinobi, and Dan did inspire me to pick it.
4563730	4574316	We had a little bit of a conversation last night about copyrighted characters making their way into different releases of this game, so I thought it would be worth mentioning.
4576097	4577598	Plus, it does have some pretty cool music.
4578759	4578839	Um...
4583043	4600517	This soundtrack is by Yuzo Koshiro, and it's actually, you can also find it in the Mega Games 2, Mega Drive 6-Pack, Sega Classics Arcade Collection for Sega CD, and the Sega Smash Pack for PC and Dreamcast.
4602378	4604880	But not on Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Projects.
4607450	4621162	Also, it is saying that the introductory game screen has Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo from the Kage no Gundan series.
4622002	4624705	Anyway, it is a side-scrolling platform game.
4624845	4625105	You can
4625285	4633875	Control Joe Musashi, and go through 8th districts, and you actually have to defeat the head of Neo Zeed.
4633895	4645448	There's three scenes in each level with their own boss characters, and you use the D-pad, A, B, and C buttons to do your ninjutsu attack, your regular attack, and your jump.
4646329	4659425	and you also have a somersault move that you can press the jump button and then press it again at the height of your jump so that you can jump more and throw 8 shuriken in the air at the same time.
4661027	4661107	Um...
4662729	4676285	So, uh, you can actually go, uh, over different layers in the area, like you can be in the foreground, in the background, indoor, outdoor, um, or on the highway or next to it with the somersault move.
4677846	4680948	Um, you have, um, different ninjutsu techniques.
4681008	4689051	You've got, um, uh, ninjutsu no, um, Ikezuchi, um, Karyu, Fushin, and Mijin.
4689852	4699196	And respectively, um, the first one's lightning, the second one's flame, the third one is, like, more jumping, and that last one is explosions.
4699977	4703238	It actually costs you one life, but, um...
4705659	4707281	If you don't have a life, then you can't do it.
4707901	4713425	You also have bonus crates that have stuff hidden in them, so you can just go beat up stuff.
4713625	4719329	It has easy, normal, hard, and hardest, just meaning more enemies and a shorter life bar.
4720250	4728596	The Japanese version, called the Super Shinobi, there are options for no death and level select.
4730186	4746393	So the different stages is Ibaraki Province, Japan, Tokyo, the Military Base, Detroit, Area Code 818, Chinatown, New York, and Neo-Zeroine Stronghold.
4747093	4749274	So now we come to the different versions.
4749334	4753075	As I was mentioning, there are different copyrighted characters in the different versions.
4755556	4756277	And I think you had one.
4756417	4756857	Don't we have one?
4758035	4761238	This game, just so everyone knows, is fucking awesome.
4761818	4765001	It was the reason to buy a Genesis back in the day.
4765121	4780834	And one of the things that was so great about it, besides the fact that it's got brutal, unforgiving difficulty if you don't puss it out and play on easy, is that as you play through the game, you ran into, like, classic movie enemies.
4781794	4785177	There was a boss who was Spider-Man, and he stayed as Spider-Man.
4785397	4786818	Sega had a Spider-Man license.
4787159	4792823	But when you beat up on Spider-Man for a while, he would crawl off the screen, and he would come back, and it was Batman.
4793523	4799248	And I mean, if it wasn't, you know, it wasn't a licensed Batman, but it would just like Batman.
4799888	4808395	And in one of the subsequent re-releases of the same cartridge, it was the same game, they replaced him with, you know, a Batman, not Batman.
4808915	4810557	One of the enemies looks like Rambo.
4810998	4814942	They took off his hair and later released him, so he didn't look like Rambo anymore.
4815623	4819667	You know, and there's a guy who looks like there's a Terminator.
4819687	4821409	I mean, he looks like Schwarzenegger.
4821869	4827596	When you hit him, his skin starts coming off, and he's a cyborg underneath, and he blows up Terminator-style.
4828136	4830038	And finally, there's Godzilla.
4831590	4840553	and it's, you know, Godzilla, you know, towering and breathing fire and they replaced him with a, like a weird skeleton.
4840893	4842794	Not Mechagodzilla, which would have been even cooler.
4843234	4848176	Do you think that that might be part of the reason why it missed out on the Mega Genesis collection thing that just came out?
4848216	4852277	Is that maybe these strange licensed bosses kept it out of the collection?
4852357	4852637	It's strange.
4852637	4853357	Thanks for watching.
4853377	4854378	See you next time.
4875336	4877397	for the Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection.
4877737	4883439	They recolored the quote-unquote Spider-Man enemies from red and blue to yellow and blue.
4883939	4888921	So, you know, probably a little bit of, you know, hey, don't want to get sued by Marvel this time around.
4890868	4892429	But I'm sure that that's what it is.
4892809	4903353	But the real pity of that is that this would have been just an awesome chance, you know, to have the Shinobi 1, 2, and 3 all at hand.
4904174	4910496	Yeah, that is the one bummer because with so many complete Sega franchises there, it's kind of a bummer to have this one missing.
4910516	4913238	But did you notice there's one other big franchise that's missing?
4913418	4913778	Strider.
4915263	4916705	Oh, it's Capcom.
4916825	4917485	Oh, that's right.
4917525	4918126	It's not Sega.
4918486	4919227	I thought Sega did it.
4920088	4921209	I've been thinking about this.
4921329	4921589	Yeah.
4921890	4928916	And this is something that I can kind of go off about because on Ultimate Genesis Collection, I mean, it's far from the Ultimate Genesis Collection.
4928997	4934302	It's a great, great collection, but it's got some clunkers that they could have replaced with.
4934942	4939964	Way better Sega games, and I'm sure that that's being saved for Sonic's even more Ultimate Genesis Collection 2.
4940604	4943485	But I mean, there was no Shadow Dancer, The Secret of Shinobi.
4944085	4947086	You know, you could have had more arcade unlockables.
4947126	4951407	Like, you had, you know, if you played Shinobi 3, you unlocked Shinobi 1, which was great.
4951527	4952248	I was so happy.
4952648	4957349	But wouldn't it have been really cool to have been able to play Shadow Dancer and then unlock the arcade version of Shadow Dancer?
4957369	4963011	Wouldn't it have been great to have been able to have unlocked, you know, maybe have had OutRun on there?
4963823	4965564	Oh yeah, I was missing, huh?
4965784	4992574	You know, just Thunder Blade, you know, they had Super Thunder Blade, but not the way better arcade Thunder Blade, After Burner, I mean, there were so many significant, I mean, that thing could have had 30 more games, and then arcade versions of those same games, and it just would have been just fantastic, but I guess you can't expect Sega to give away the company for 30 bucks, I expect though, so they should have done it, but yeah, it would have been really cool to have just had the whole Shinobi franchise in one place, which
4992834	5021789	you know, had the lock on technology with the Sonic and that but, you know, back to Revenge of Shinobi it's awesome if you have a Sega Genesis kicking around it's a super common cartridge you might get lucky find that you have one of the early release cartridges with all the all the bosses even the one I had back in the day had the Rambo guys edited the one I have now actually does have the Rambo guys so I was pretty stoked when I was playing it super, super awesome game really hard
5023044	5024425	There's more changes, actually.
5025286	5041641	They also did, for release 1.02, which was the last release, they also did put up an acknowledgement of the Spider-Man copyright, and there was only one ending you had to save now to win the game.
5042622	5045945	Yeah, the way that you get the ending in that game is totally cool.
5046045	5047286	You get into the final level...
5048248	5050130	And I think, I mean, I'm sure a lot of people have done it.
5050150	5054716	Because again, when you play, when you talk to people online, you always find out that the game you thought you were a botto at.
5055517	5056138	People are better.
5056618	5065289	But to get the final ending, you had to fight the boss while your girl ran around in the background and a giant cement block lowered towards her.
5066184	5066364	Also, um...
5097458	5099783	There was an European version.
5099823	5104311	The shuriken is replaced by throwing knives because of legal status at the time.
5106855	5106956	Um...
5108826	5111108	It's pretty cool, actually.
5112189	5118373	A bunch of the music was performed at the 4th Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig.
5119234	5123818	And it was also performed at two of the concerts of Play in Stockholm.
5124878	5133705	And it was also at the same Play concert in Singapore in June 2007.
5135126	5135666	So there you go.
5136287	5140368	That's for Revenge of Shinobi.
5140588	5145090	Alright, there you got it.
5145850	5148852	As far as game music goes too, this made Yuzo Kishiro.
5149072	5151973	So if you're into game music, you know who Yuzo Kishiro is.
5152993	5157215	If you're really interested in his work and you haven't played Revenge of Shinobi, what are you doing?
5158382	5163730	So definitely one of the most notable missing games from the Genesis Collection just recently came out.
5163790	5171161	Revenge of Shinobi is the Classic Game of the Week, so you'll have to check it out somehow else besides the Classic Game Collection for those of you guys checking that out this week.
5171822	5173825	Good pick, DarkSakura and Dan.
5174746	5176808	This week on the Classic Game of the Week.
5177348	5180351	And that is going to bring to a close, as it always does, part A of our program.
5180371	5181192	But don't go anywhere.
5181232	5185215	We'll be right back after a little break with some more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5185235	5188658	And in part B tonight, we're going to be talking a little bit about the new website.
5188698	5190440	I know it's some exciting new information.
5191080	5200229	Talk a little bit about Fear 2, Grand Theft Auto 4, more Sega, if you can believe it, and some very interesting trademarks, Persona 4, and Konami.
5200689	5202653	Getting a little taste of their own medicine this week.
5202673	5205359	We're going to be talking about that also a little bit right after the break.
5205700	5206321	So stay tuned.
5206341	5209568	We'll be back more in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5215734	5223158	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, February the 15th of 2009, the day after Valentine's Day.
5224119	5227421	And here in studio, unfortunately JTV stopped working.
5227821	5231403	We were having problems on the server end, so we just decided to say, screw it.
5231843	5251765	and we hooked up Street Fighter 4 which is what we're playing right now on the in-studio TV we will try to get it up on Justin TV if we're able to get back on there we already tried reconnecting it didn't work it's on there and it's something so I guess some JTV channels are up but not us but we'll be back on Justin TV hopefully soon and it's just going to be footage of Street Fighter 4 with us talking so that should be interesting
5252626	5253386	Thank you for watching!
5277155	5283175	I love that one of the best characters in the game, well, one of the most fun characters in the game is just a total joke.
5284628	5285749	Very, very nice, though.
5286590	5288672	I want to say this as well in the chat.
5288692	5293576	And SSJ100Matt reminded me of this, although I swear I was going to say something about this at the top of Part B as well.
5294216	5297519	We got a swag bag from our New York City contingent.
5298260	5301262	Specifically, SSJ100Matt, I believe, put this all together for us.
5301282	5302644	I don't know if he had some help or what have you.
5302944	5311091	But we want to say a big, big thank you to them for getting us some of the swag, including lots of Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars stuff.
5311111	5312132	Which Loki took it all.
5312512	5313092	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5333727	5335628	All right, Loki, why don't you start us off with some news?
5335688	5339970	I actually want to run in the house and get some tea, so Street Fighter 4 will have to wait.
5339990	5343652	And I think Dan doesn't want to give it up anyway, so why don't you get into some news, Loki?
5343712	5352896	He has to unlock me and the other two characters, so... Anyways, Fear 2, they had some pretty interesting advertisement for Fear 2.
5353556	5356958	In the UK, actually, they had trained black cats.
5357578	5359139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5381024	5384086	I mean, I'm surprised, but, you know, that they didn't have their own agenda.
5384487	5391632	But, um, anyways, what's even cooler is if you happen to live in the UK, there's a number you can call to get your own Fear 2 cat shirt.
5392553	5396776	I totally, okay, for our UK listeners, somebody get me a shirt for Shermie.
5399839	5402341	Yeah, make sure it's a 3XL cat size.
5403442	5405683	Shermie is a fat fucking cat.
5405883	5406584	I love my cat.
5406764	5407084	I know.
5407245	5410067	And I will put it on her and model her.
5411187	5412468	with the fear shirt on.
5412708	5414429	You could just probably get like a blank.
5414449	5416090	I don't know if you could make a pattern.
5416110	5418212	I want an official fear shirt for my cat.
5419333	5421014	Well, I don't know.
5421034	5422915	And then later on it's probably Dolphy sized.
5426894	5427514	Thanks for watching!
5448221	5449342	I think it's awesome.
5449482	5452604	I would put one of these on my cat if she wouldn't claw me to death.
5452664	5457707	Biohaze20 in chat asks, My cat talks and smokes a lot of pot.
5457767	5459068	Is that eligible for cat shows?
5459608	5459868	Anyone?
5459888	5460168	I don't know.
5460228	5461249	I might get a disqualified.
5462070	5467513	Does the cat actually smoke pot or do you blow pot smoke in the cat's face?
5467533	5469034	That would be for the Stoned Olympics.
5470214	5470976	That it talks to you.
5470996	5473419	Remember, Eddie Izzard talked about the Stoned Olympics.
5474921	5475462	What's that?
5475763	5476484	The Stoned Olympics.
5476504	5477265	I've not heard of this.
5477365	5480049	Where you're tested for drugs to make sure that you've taken enough.
5480109	5480530	I see.
5480850	5482353	Not that Orin Sanche would condone this.
5483394	5484416	Drugs are bad, okay?
5485438	5486379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5512957	5514118	This is the Midnight Jungle.
5514199	5515260	It's Blanca's stage, I think.
5515280	5515500	I see.
5515720	5515980	Sorry.
5516581	5520104	Anyhow, it's going to be like this for the whole second half of the show tonight.
5520484	5522206	It's okay.
5523207	5525649	Grand Theft Auto IV Lost in the Dam not only is a...
5527668	5534871	Not only is it coming with, of course, all the great download content, a free week of multiplayer from the 17th to the 22nd.
5535191	5537492	It's called a Game with Rockstar event.
5538092	5542154	You can play The Lost and the Damned online for free if you don't have Xbox Live Gold.
5542574	5547576	Although I'm surprised there's that many folks out there that have this game and not have Xbox Live Gold, but I guess there's enough.
5548236	5549356	So, there you go.
5549517	5554138	Yeah, really, you need it online anyways because, I mean, there's not much to do if you don't have it and you beat the game.
5554198	5555419	I mean, I don't know.
5556414	5563580	But it's weird, though, because even this game, when Saints Row 2 came out, I'm like, I'm going to be playing Saints Row 2 a lot more than Grand Theft Auto 4.
5564180	5564800	Not the case.
5565321	5566222	It's so weird.
5566942	5567963	So, I don't know.
5570652	5571012	All right.
5571713	5573294	Actually, I'm going to have to interrupt here.
5573474	5582082	I know that DarkSakura is dying to do a story here, but I have an OLR special bulletin, if you will.
5582843	5585105	I need the theme music for when we have special bulletins.
5585145	5585505	Do we have?
5586065	5588427	I used to have a little trumpet announcement thing we used to do.
5590209	5591010	How about this, Rob?
5591230	5591430	What?
5594152	5594593	That'll work.
5595453	5596715	The new website is live.
5597717	5606894	So check it out, www.orangeloungeradio.com And there it is, orangeloungeradio.com is up So check it out You know what that earns?
5607475	5607696	What?
5610376	5612517	No, in all reality, though, I'm actually loading it up right now.
5612557	5623325	In all reality, we want to say a big, big, big, big, big thank you to Deekman and VXJasonXV for their hard work on getting the new website up and running.
5623345	5624045	What do you mean it isn't?
5624065	5625026	I'm looking at it right now.
5625686	5626347	It looks great.
5626727	5630209	So thank you guys so much for everybody that put that together.
5630570	5631010	It's amazing.
5631610	5633131	And it has a little Space Invader.
5633772	5637874	And as TigerClaw says in chat, it's much easier on the eyes than the old site.
5638615	5639876	Well, maybe there was some...
5640996	5643378	I am posting photographic proof
5668510	5674373	DarkSakura right now is taking pictures of us playing Street Fighter 4 here in studio and she's going to upload them to the OL Army Picks gallery so you have something to check out.
5674413	5675894	There's DarkTetsuya with an old-ass pinball table.
5697731	5698632	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5730077	5735079	Sega re-registered the trademarks for Rez and 18-wheeler American Pro Trucker.
5735799	5738300	They were Dreamcast titles, as you might recall.
5738720	5744142	But hey, we've also got the Rez Remix thingamadookie, right?
5745082	5745742	Thingamadookie?
5746563	5748103	Rez HD Remix thingamadookie?
5748283	5750624	Yeah, for MatchingService.com.
5752244	5753425	But no, we've...
5755228	5764273	So they've renewed those, so who knows, we may have new truckin' action with a really poppy soundtrack.
5764293	5767655	Yeah, that's what I'm hoping, is that they actually combine the two games, and we get 18 wheeler res.
5767735	5769956	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hold on.
5770496	5770836	Uh-oh.
5771797	5776820	It's Sakura versus Dan on Street Fighter IV, so... Unfortunately, I'm Sakura.
5777740	5779241	This is just gonna bug us all night.
5780001	5780742	Why are you Sakura?
5780762	5781342	Because I lost.
5784464	5789611	Anyhow, who knows what interesting games could come of these remake trademarks.
5790272	5790572	I don't know.
5791574	5795539	This picture is going up because this is our daily life at home.
5796621	5797642	Dan versus Sakura.
5797742	5809352	What's interesting though, and this is kind of a rumor that's been around for a while now, in fact I remember another story about this, the Sega Vintage Collection is rumored to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5810633	5817820	You may remember a while back they had some screenshots of the Sega Vintage Collection with the Sonic the Hedgehog games or something like that.
5818360	5826286	Well, apparently this vintage collection is supposed to be bringing some of the old Genesis games to Xbox Live Arcade.
5826486	5832851	Some of these games, you might expect, are Gunstar Heroes, Comic Zone, Altered Beasts, Shinobi 3, and Sonic the Hedgehog 3.
5835292	5840156	Okay, but I just bought all of those games on the Mega Genesis collection, so what's the freaking point?
5840276	5841597	Gunstar Heroes is not on it.
5841817	5842718	Okay, one game.
5844491	5849175	And I also... Anyway, I already bought Gunstar Hero because it was one of the first virtual console games on the Wii.
5849256	5859685	I don't get it either, but, you know, then again, they also released Hedgehog and stuff by, you know, standalone, so maybe people want just one game and... It just... I don't see the value in that.
5860366	5860906	And, you know...
5861667	5863668	I see Gamer says it's on PSN as well.
5863708	5878093	Well, yeah, but I have the collection thingy on PS3, so... You know, and sadly, the only way that this would actually work as far as being, you know, worthwhile is if they have those, like, say, four or five games and charge, like, maybe five or ten bucks for it or something like that.
5878553	5881094	And then having it kind of like a mini version of that collection.
5881174	5884055	But at the same time, it's like, what's the point?
5884075	5887797	Because you can just go purchase, you know, 40 games for, you know, 30 bucks.
5887957	5890598	Or you can wait for the price drop and you'll get 40 games for 20 bucks.
5892918	5893238	I don't know.
5893598	5894099	I don't know either.
5894179	5895259	It's a little interesting.
5896199	5897080	But it's a rumor right now.
5897120	5898961	It's coming from a Dutch gaming site.
5899001	5904223	But it's kind of weird, though, that we see two of these same types of rumors happening before.
5904283	5905544	So, I don't know.
5905944	5908325	Acidic Vampire in chat says Achievement Whores will buy it.
5908665	5909085	That's true.
5909586	5910926	Achievement Whores will definitely buy it.
5912087	5912667	Very, very true.
5915339	5923569	Well, another fighting game going on out there in the world, not just Street Fighter 4, but how many of you guys are fans of WrestleMania?
5925097	5926739	Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan
5947558	5947858	Sweet.
5948098	5951440	And it's going to be like a battle game where you can fight all these people.
5951760	5956361	And just to give you just a sampling of the 42 characters, again, this is a rumor.
5956782	5961043	It's coming from NeoGAF, those forums, but hey, you know what?
5961083	5964164	If you want to put together a hell of a WrestleMania game, this sounds like a good place to start.
5964684	5975869	Andre the Giant, Bam Bam Bigelow, Big Boss Man, Bret Hart, The Hammer, Hacksaw, Hulk Hogan, Jake the Snake Roberts, Jim the Anvil, Nate Hart, uh...
5977049	5983354	King Kong Bundy, Million Dollar Men, Mr. Fuji, Mr. Perfect, Ric Flair, Sgt.
5983414	5987957	Slaughter, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Undertaker, Yokozuna, I mean just tons.
5988237	5989078	The Rock, of course.
5989658	5995222	Just some awesome, awesome... Sadly, most of which are dead.
5996003	5998725	SSJ100Matt says, I played this at Comic Con.
5998745	5999425	It's a lot of fun.
5999725	6000366	I wouldn't doubt it.
6001547	6003188	That's an ultimate fighting game right there.
6003828	6004689	That's going to be a lot of fun.
6006368	6010911	Even though I'm not a big WrestleMania fan, I do remember the old school WrestleMania on the NES.
6011011	6016315	That was one of the first fighting games ever that had six of those characters in it.
6016335	6019498	I remember Macho Man was in it, and Hulk, and Andre.
6021079	6024681	The Million Dollar Man had a little dollar sign he had to get that was a power-up.
6024801	6027864	There was just these dumb little things in it that made it awesome.
6029365	6032227	It's kind of cool that WrestleMania has lasted all this time.
6032867	6035409	Didn't they just have their 25th anniversary or something like that?
6036704	6037324	Which one?
6037344	6040245	WrestleMania had like a 25th anniversary or something just recently.
6040525	6040845	I don't know.
6040865	6041325	They had something.
6041485	6042766	It was a big anniversary for it, I know.
6043306	6047567	Anyhow, I'm sure somebody in chat that's a big wrestling fan will correct me momentarily.
6047647	6048868	So, yeah.
6049088	6050148	WWF WrestleFest.
6050168	6051468	I thought it was WrestleMania.
6054269	6055650	Yeah, WrestleMania is the big one I'm thinking of.
6056570	6060911	Well, at any rate, how about some news from Squeenix?
6061812	6062332	Squeenix?
6063512	6063752	Sure.
6065433	6065713	Well...
6067250	6077203	At any rate, the PlayStation 2 game Persona 4 is going to be out in the UK on March 13th.
6078304	6083851	And the PAL box is going to have a special CD soundtrack with 24 tracks.
6085813	6092135	has a new plot, new places to go, new stuff to look at, new things to kill, new spookies.
6093076	6101539	And it is the same stylized manga pop culture art to go in the game.
6102799	6106620	So go check it out for when it's out.
6106701	6111602	And actually it's supposed to be not too far off from the style of Persona 3.
6111642	6112142	So go for it.
6115641	6118264	They're just using the same engine for Persona 3, if I remember right.
6119465	6120886	Just kind of milking money out of it.
6120926	6121567	But hey, you know what?
6121667	6129475	Actually, there's a lot of love out there for Persona 3, and I haven't played it personally, but I hear it's very in-depth, and it's pretty cool.
6130075	6132297	This is one of those games I want to check out on a rainy day somewhere.
6133920	6134741	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6163960	6166261	Not Tortilla, but Tortilla.
6166581	6172685	He's a fitness expert and apparently a host of some AM talk radio show called Shape Up America.
6173365	6188333	And he has announced plans that he's going to file a class action lawsuit against Nintendo claiming that people are getting injured playing Wii games because Nintendo isn't telling people to properly warm up before doing exercise.
6189298	6200461	He claims that Wii Fit has led to people sustaining injuries in their knees, back, and wrists because of improper warm-up.
6201741	6202081	I don't know.
6202101	6203521	I think this is kind of a stretch.
6203721	6212803	I mean, that's just like saying, oh, well, I got up and walked down the stairs, but my TV didn't tell me to warm up before I did activity.
6214044	6215304	On top of that, actually...
6218219	6220061	This is something that people have been doing for years.
6220121	6233850	Before you do any physical activity, it's a good idea, even before stretching, it's a good idea to warm up your muscles before you even stretch or you're at risk for injury in the tendons and tissue.
6233890	6239294	I mean, that's just, should be common sense, the stuff that they teach you when you're in school.
6239761	6240321	Thanks for watching!
6258464	6260726	That's not their fault.
6260826	6265890	It's the fault of people playing it that are getting way too into the game and hurting themselves.
6266310	6269773	GS68 in the chatroom has a good point at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
6269813	6275818	He says DDR doesn't tell people to stretch either, and it's been getting away with it for so, so long, right?
6276979	6279421	Yeah, it shouldn't even be a thing.
6279441	6280762	It's a frivolous lawsuit.
6280822	6281683	It's going to get thrown out.
6284471	6284872	I agree.
6284932	6285413	And you know what?
6285473	6289141	Frivolous lawsuits, I don't know about you guys, but frivolous lawsuits make me angry.
6289602	6294052	And when we get angry here at Orange Lounge Radio, we cue that nasty music and say some nasty things.
6310566	6311607	I have two FUs.
6312487	6317390	The first one being the internet connection at my house because of the damn wind.
6317830	6326114	Which, this really isn't like wind, but unfortunately Sacramento has no idea what to do when a tree moves.
6326414	6327975	To be fair, California in general.
6329336	6329716	Yeah.
6330596	6331337	But, I mean...
6332608	6334130	Plan for the fucking wind.
6334310	6337793	We get windstorms here every so often, so just plan for it.
6338754	6340616	And be prepared for everything.
6340656	6341817	Constant vigilance!
6343553	6364110	and then my other FU goes towards Half.com for the school book that I ordered that still hasn't arrived but I will say that I don't think I got charged for it so that means I have to go find the damn thing again and I don't want to buy it from school because school is fucking expensive.
6365151	6370015	I would rather be frugal because I have things that my money is better spent on.
6371576	6371916	The end.
6374270	6375351	Loki, do you have any FUs of the week?
6389808	6414758	and it keeps fucking raining and it always rains like on the weekend it's dry through the week and then it starts raining and then wind and ugh but so now this next week I'm hoping to be able to go airsofting it might actually have to be that Saturday instead of Sunday morning which is annoying but Actdeft in chat has a suggestion for you he says blame it on the rain yeah yeah forget it
6416085	6416646	Ah, that's funny.
6417066	6421690	But right now, um, I have a feeling, though, it's going to still be raining next week.
6421930	6422650	Fucking weather.
6423111	6429516	Yeah, sure, it doesn't rain all, you know, before this, and now all of a sudden it's just like, oh, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, more, more rain.
6432389	6433709	Alright, well my F.U.
6433729	6436770	of the week goes to having the worst Valentine's Day ever.
6437190	6437590	Ever.
6437730	6440771	Because I was sick and I was having what you call a horizontal day.
6440811	6442572	That means I was lying on the couch all day long.
6442692	6444592	So yeah, I made Valentine's Day kind of suck.
6446113	6448253	And I was just bored and lonely and sad.
6449314	6451314	So, you know, I just wanted a hug.
6451334	6452214	Is that so wrong?
6453395	6454435	But yeah, Valentine's Day sucks.
6454455	6454855	But what is it?
6454915	6455775	It's just another day, right?
6456796	6458196	Dan, do you have any F.U.s of the week real quick?
6460458	6464640	I just want to say FU to Ryu because he keeps kicking my ass and that's about it.
6465640	6466320	Alright, there you have it.
6466420	6466840	FU to Ryu.
6467981	6468321	Alright.
6469662	6472843	That's going to do it for the FUs of the week but let's get back into some gaming news and guess what?
6472863	6474724	The lawsuit stories are not over.
6474824	6475384	That's right.
6476264	6477705	Guess who got sued this time though?
6477765	6479025	It's almost a twist of fate.
6479425	6487769	You know how there's this running inside joke that Konami will sue ever since they sued Rockstar which I still think they were in the right to sue them.
6487789	6488089	I agree.
6488129	6488729	They were totally
6488869	6493011	I think they were totally in the right, but some of the lawsuits since then have been a little interesting.
6493451	6495252	Well, now the tables have gotten turned.
6495552	6497172	Konami got sued this week.
6497592	6497853	Yep.
6498393	6500854	So now it's not Konami will sue, it's Konami got sued.
6501594	6506956	Viacom and Harmonix sued Konami over the game Rock Revolution.
6507476	6511998	They say that Rock Revolution violates their patents for musical instrument peripherals.
6512918	6514159	But wait a minute, um...
6514946	6515907	Thank you for watching!
6537583	6552515	I don't know, but I guess, well, more so, they probably want cash for it, and they probably want, I don't know, some type of... I would, you know, it's sad to say, I would say that Rock Revolution impacted the sale of Rock Band in no way whatsoever.
6553236	6554457	I know, for real, right?
6554577	6560622	I can't honestly say there's been one person on the face of the earth that said, ooh, Rock Revolution, that's way better than Rock Band.
6561943	6563324	But this is so strange.
6563384	6574448	Apparently, even though the Viacom patent says that it improved on earlier video game music controllers and even kind of references Beatmania, they're still... But this is the weird thing about it.
6574828	6578229	Konami didn't put out a new guitar with this game.
6578269	6581490	They put out a new drum set, which probably sold five of them.
6581670	6586572	Unless the internals of the drum set are something similar to what's put out there.
6586932	6590274	But their drum set looked like their old drum set for Drummania.
6590814	6591114	I mean...
6591866	6592747	It looked like crap.
6593327	6594908	And it apparently played like crap.
6595008	6596229	So I don't understand.
6597589	6597990	I don't know.
6598170	6601131	Other than maybe it's like, well, fine, you sued us, but we're going to sue you back.
6601712	6604293	We sue you too.
6605374	6612738	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Aaron or YYR takes pride that Snake360 has outsold Rock Revolution.
6613358	6614519	That's probably a true fact.
6614559	6615280	I wouldn't doubt that at all.
6615380	6616060	I wouldn't doubt it.
6616440	6618241	He does have gut mechanics.
6619582	6622444	We got Rufus now fighting.
6622544	6624125	By the way, they're saying JustinTV's back up.
6624145	6627807	You might want to try to connect one more time on the thing, then the folks can see this.
6628388	6635212	And at least the live listeners will get to understand what we're talking about, even if the podcast listeners are screwed.
6635232	6636052	Nope, still not working.
6636353	6636953	Nah, it's a bummer.
6638464	6638724	All right.
6639305	6642528	Well, anyhow, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this one turns out.
6642568	6643509	I wonder if they'll settle.
6643609	6645331	I wonder if somebody's just trying to make a point.
6645611	6646332	I have no idea.
6646392	6648034	Yeah, Frisbee in our chatroom sums it up.
6648434	6649596	Lawsuit ping pong.
6649636	6651598	That's exactly what appears to be happening here.
6651618	6654801	I just – I cannot see – there's no case here.
6654861	6655622	I mean, it's just –
6657144	6660465	It didn't affect their sales at all.
6660525	6667667	The sales of Rock Revolution were so freaking poor that I don't see how they can say, oh, well, our sales were impacted.
6668247	6671688	If it's Guitar Hero Rock Band, maybe there's something there.
6672788	6683771	I know it seems like we're always siding with Konami on this show, but don't take that too much because, honestly, we're just saying that having to put your name on Rock Revolution was punishment enough.
6684571	6685672	It's not good.
6685692	6689274	There's no financial liability.
6689755	6691456	I don't think it's warranted, but what do I know?
6691496	6692116	I'm not a judge.
6692297	6697981	I can say maybe that they... Do they have vocals in Rock Revolution?
6698001	6698681	I don't think they did.
6699302	6700602	I don't think they're the actual songs.
6700983	6703545	Oh yeah, I know you don't sing along.
6703585	6704865	I think it's all cover bands.
6704885	6707347	There's no karaoke portion of that.
6708728	6709469	Hell, I don't know.
6709849	6710570	Whatever.
6710710	6711570	What's the point of the game?
6713058	6714459	Yeah, something like that.
6714659	6717940	Well, here's something that our World of Warcraft listeners will be more interested in.
6718201	6718541	Yay!
6719981	6721342	Have you actually gone back to play?
6722082	6726104	Not yet, but what you're about to tell us might... I'm very proud of you.
6726364	6727845	Oh my god, it's still moving.
6728666	6732187	Sorry, I'm very proud of you if you've resisted the urge.
6732467	6733708	I have, it's been like three weeks now.
6735010	6736091	Ooh, tap that vein.
6737311	6742935	Well, there's more about the dual talent stuff in case you were interested.
6744435	6748117	You know, the dual talent spec system is coming out in the game...
6750920	6757223	And it's going to have it to where you can switch your characters between your customization setups.
6757743	6765086	One for raiding, one for PvP, and possibly one, you know, between, you know, one for healing and one for damaging.
6766207	6772610	The option is only going to be available once you have hit level 80 first.
6775744	6788793	And basically the reason is, according to Greg Street, who is a ghost crawler, that they didn't want to make the game more complex for lower levels who are still trying to learn their class.
6790414	6795298	But he said if it proves popular, then they will consider expanding it.
6795738	6803501	She'll basically pay a one-time fee to your in-game class trainer to access your dual specs.
6803581	6809903	And after that, you can switch between the two at any lexicon of power in any city.
6812824	6824709	Also, if you have the inscription profession, you can sell portable lexicon of power that will require a group of players to summon and use anywhere but during combat or an arena.
6824969	6826430	Oh god, that's going to be so nice.
6827011	6828572	Oh my god, raiding is going to change.
6828592	6830753	So you can switch roles in the middle of a raid.
6830913	6842642	That's, yeah, you can basically, like, if you need, like, for instance, I'm thinking Anaximus, you can get through most of the event with just two healers, but it's really nice to have a third healer for four horsemen.
6842922	6849167	So just imagine before you engage four horsemen, okay, let's summon the Lexicon of Power and we're going to have our druid switch from Boomkin to Resto.
6849527	6853871	I mean, that's going to change the dynamics big time.
6854511	6864938	Well, with the specs themselves, you'll get the dual setup with your action bars and your glyphs that will just switch automatically when you change over to the other spec.
6866759	6880608	There will also be a gear manager that will allow you to change between your equipable items, whether they be individual or entire equipment sets, between the two specs.
6883047	6892916	It seems pretty complex, but they're actually saying that it's going to be on the public test server soon, but not immediately available.
6894457	6903365	They said, though, that it would be starting off with possibly the next content patch, but the gear manager is not going to be at the same time.
6903405	6904106	It'll fall later.
6905066	6908349	Yeah, it'll probably be a little while before we actually see this go into the game.
6908690	6911673	But I think they're doing the Uludar patch is, what, 3.1?
6912153	6916518	And so that's probably when we'll start seeing dual specking, but the gear thing will probably be a little while.
6917439	6918600	So, there you go.
6919481	6927229	And the chat is making fun of me for knowing exactly all this WoW talk and all that.
6927814	6928234	DarkSakura.com
6947938	6957801	Luckily, I have Street Fighter 4 to oogle over, and Dan is right now on the last boss, Seth, who looks like the glowing guy from the Watchmen trailers to me.
6958641	6959442	That's what he looks like.
6959462	6965563	Yeah, and he's a cheap bastard that has the specials from a whole bunch of different characters.
6967104	6968844	This is not Dural.
6970785	6971645	Thank you, TigerClaw.
6971705	6973245	Dr. Manhattan, that's what I was trying to think of.
6973285	6974526	He looks like Dr. Manhattan to me.
6975721	6982947	Also has very abnormal muscles in a true anatomical sense.
6983067	6984348	He ate a spinning yin-yang.
6984528	6985129	No, no, no, no.
6985169	6994556	I'm talking about he has got like going down from a solar plexus in between his ribs to between his major abdominals.
6994976	6998159	He's got a whole ridge of like bonus muscles that don't exist.
6998179	6999420	Okay, now who's talking in foreign language?
7001362	7002926	Sorry, I noticed this stuff, Rob.
7002986	7003547	I'm just messing.
7004650	7007537	He's got extra muscles in his ass!
7009938	7019021	Anyways, there's a game coming out on PC in April and possibly, well, in the PS3, I guess, in quarter three this year.
7019741	7020341	Free Realms.
7020521	7025443	It's a free MMORPG and it's, I guess, kind of geared towards kids.
7026323	7031925	And you will be able to play it for free on the PlayStation Network whenever that happens to come out.
7032825	7033445	So that's kind of neat.
7034126	7041951	And it's, I guess, I don't know if it's going to be, I'm assuming it's one of those free-to-play, but you have to pay for upgrade type things.
7042051	7043932	But hey, free's good, I guess.
7044493	7045393	It doesn't look that bad.
7048255	7048716	But I don't know.
7049176	7049796	I haven't really played it.
7053038	7053739	Well, okay then.
7055558	7059699	Well, Street Fighter IV Mania is sweeping not just the U.S., but Japan.
7059839	7062319	And when I say mania, I mean mania.
7064079	7066900	86,000 copies sold in the first day alone in Japan.
7067260	7070541	And if that doesn't sound like a lot of copies, you need to understand this.
7070941	7072401	They are sold out in Japan.
7072561	7074901	You can't find this game in Japan right now.
7075261	7077542	86,000 was the first pressing, and it's gone.
7078182	7081322	Apparently, they are going to try and crank some more of these guys out as fast as they can.
7081382	7083903	But right now, they're like Nintendo Wii's.
7085043	7086204	Trying to find these guys.
7086544	7086924	Not easy.
7087244	7089185	I wonder if the same thing is going to happen over here in the U.S.
7089285	7095327	I don't think fighting games are as big here, but I definitely think this is the type of thing that you're probably going to be hoping you had a pre-order for.
7095347	7098549	Or you're going to have to run to Best Buy when they open or the stores that don't do.
7098569	7100289	Actually, even Best Buy does pre-orders now, huh?
7100589	7101590	Who doesn't do pre-orders?
7102529	7103129	Circuit City.
7103149	7103989	Well, look what happened to them.
7104530	7106830	Kmart doesn't do pre-orders, so you'll have to run to Kmart at noon.
7107090	7107530	That's true.
7107550	7113052	If you ever want to get a game on launch day, go to Kmart, because no one shops at Kmart, if you remember the old Orange Launch Radio piece of advice.
7113552	7116013	No one shops at Kmart.
7116173	7117853	Actually, I shop at Kmart now.
7118393	7118893	You know why?
7119274	7124355	Because the Target right over here by the house is closed for remodeling until October.
7124595	7127236	They're turning it into an Uber Target or whatever.
7127556	7128076	A Great Land?
7128096	7128176	Yeah.
7128596	7129817	Yeah, I think it's turning into a great land.
7130178	7133761	So the Target is closed for the foreseeable future.
7134362	7136824	And I will not go to Walmart.
7138065	7138245	Why?
7138325	7140107	The other Target great land is kind of a ways away.
7140147	7141148	Why won't you go to Walmart?
7141328	7143230	Because it's dirty and it's ghetto.
7143290	7144291	Have you been to the one over here?
7144571	7145192	It's ghetto.
7145212	7146533	It's the Rancho Cambodia of Walmart.
7146553	7148075	Because it makes you hate humanity.
7148395	7148915	For real.
7149576	7151418	So I would rather go to Kmart, honestly.
7152619	7152759	So...
7153840	7154240	There you go.
7154300	7155781	How's that for some reversal?
7155961	7158202	Misty says, hey, I shopped at Kmart right after Christmas.
7158242	7159062	Got some cute jeans.
7159542	7160023	There you go.
7160603	7161843	They came from the 80s?
7163844	7166645	Are the jeans bedazzled in the back?
7167186	7168886	That type of 80s style?
7170927	7172328	No, they're stonewashed, Rob.
7172348	7174329	They're acid washed.
7176229	7176550	Nice.
7177850	7178150	All right.
7178550	7179411	Can we move on?
7179531	7180011	Yeah, yeah.
7181747	7182227	DarkSakura
7204685	7207046	Well, how about some Star Trek Online?
7207066	7207566	How about it?
7207846	7221230	Because, oh my god, we were talking about the character trailer last week, and it's pretty, and I am making the OLRians, the official alien race of Orange Sounds Radio, and yes, they are orange.
7221991	7222711	Well, maybe.
7224932	7236378	But they're actually saying that there will not be any famous Star Trek personas available in Star Trek Online.
7238539	7249103	They're basically saying it's in the future where the majority of the known characters have passed on, except for the ones that are robots, holograms, ghosts, etc, etc.
7249243	7250724	Or Spock.
7250884	7252244	So we could see data.
7253145	7253665	No, he died.
7254225	7255705	Oh, that's right!
7257686	7257966	Damn it!
7258687	7261168	Lore... I don't remember.
7262348	7263568	Okay, Trackies, help me out.
7264469	7265249	What happened to Lore?
7265349	7266369	I think he got disassembled.
7267270	7267350	Um...
7268154	7269254	There's always more of them.
7271015	7274535	I want Q. I want there to be a freaking Q mission.
7276376	7277376	I want a Q mission.
7277996	7279617	Okay.
7282637	7290539	However, they have actually been talking to some other folks and...
7292844	7295867	They don't really... I don't think they've ruled it out.
7295947	7300270	Cryptic hasn't ruled it out, but it's not likely.
7300931	7303833	Although, who knows what might happen with those transporter accidents.
7307636	7309017	Oh, Dan's bringing out the big guns.
7309037	7309158	Ooh.
7310475	7314217	Dan is still trying to fight the last boss of the game and is having problems.
7314237	7315758	He's a cheap bitch.
7315878	7318700	It's massive jaw.
7320641	7323742	Did Seth suck you in his stomach and then shoot you out?
7323763	7325463	Because that's what it looked like in that one part.
7326424	7327264	That's disgusting.
7327765	7333708	It's massive jaw versus person who's been taking too much colloidal silver.
7334388	7335589	You know that turns you blue for real.
7335749	7336089	Wow.
7336470	7336850	It's true.
7337570	7338631	You're a chemistry nerd.
7339028	7339568	I am not.
7339929	7343291	I just happen to know that because I have an odd interest in skin diseases.
7344072	7347194	Alright, we're going to get to the mailbag here soon, but a couple more stories for you first.
7347794	7348274	Well, guess what?
7348314	7350616	There's a new artist coming to Rock Band.
7351156	7352717	Is it someone good?
7352918	7353718	Miley Cyrus?
7353938	7355399	No, it's not Miley Cyrus.
7355419	7356220	Danny Minogue?
7356440	7357760	No, it's not Danny Manilow.
7358360	7359961	It's Snoop Dogg.
7360841	7364022	Just when I think of rock band, I think of Snoop Dogg.
7364182	7365142	Yes, Snoop Dogg.
7365442	7368383	He is coming to rock band as download content.
7371003	7377805	No word on which songs they're actually going to put in rock band, but I don't know many of them that are rock-ish, you know?
7378705	7379065	I don't know.
7379365	7379905	Who cares?
7380005	7381126	Let's just play Gin and Juice.
7381246	7382026	That'll still be fun.
7384207	7385528	Actdeft says faux shizzle.
7385548	7387049	You want to go riding with the homies?
7388190	7388930	Wasn't that Coolio?
7389331	7389991	No, that was Coolio.
7390031	7390351	Sorry.
7390371	7391772	Coolio was rolling with the homies.
7391812	7393573	Coolio was Coolio-er.
7395195	7395775	Sorry.
7396836	7399577	Please tell me there's some other bands that make more sense for a rock band.
7399858	7402099	Yeah, there's some other stuff coming too.
7402960	7405922	You know, White Zombie, which makes me happy.
7405982	7409184	There's two songs from White Zombie, Black Sunshine and More Human Than Humans.
7409730	7410971	More human than human
7440100	7446042	Some actual Puff Daddy song, I think, that they did a rock version of.
7446122	7450044	That would fit for rock band, although I think it's kind of old.
7450564	7452965	I remember seeing this back when I was playing Cusar.
7452985	7455526	That's years ago.
7456346	7458107	You know what song I'm surprised they haven't put in there?
7459127	7461308	It's the Public Enemy Anthrax, Bring the Noise.
7462589	7463329	Where is that?
7465157	7470861	Or I was going to suggest the Run DMC and Aerosmith, but that was actually in the Aerosmith Guitar Hero, wasn't it?
7471121	7475264	That was in Guitar Hero Aerosmith, but we need actual rocking out.
7475304	7476145	We need Anthrax.
7478327	7479307	Anthrax and Public Enemy.
7479347	7481109	I still say we need GWAR, but that's just me.
7482229	7483190	Yeah, we need GWAR.
7483510	7484391	GWAR!
7484411	7486833	Okay, we need rock band GWAR.
7487751	7488472	or Rob Zombie.
7488512	7490795	I'd be good with Rob Zombie even though, you know, white zombies.
7490955	7492818	They have some Rob Zombie but not Dragula.
7493178	7494260	More Rob Zombie there.
7495021	7495281	All right.
7496202	7498545	Anyhow, let's do some more news and we'll get to mailbag.
7498566	7500628	I have one more story here and it's about G.I.
7500688	7502611	Joe and of course...
7502671	7502751	Yay!
7502831	7503091	Yay!
7503111	7503211	Yay!
7525326	7527347	If you do well as you play the G.I.
7527387	7532349	Joe game, you will unlock vintage educational clips where G.I.
7532409	7537751	Joe comes out and does this little spiel and says, and now you know, and knowing is half the battle.
7538391	7539832	So that's pretty amazing.
7540996	7542077	So, awesome.
7542737	7548041	Now you have a reason to get this if you don't have them all on Betamax tape or something like that.
7548081	7548422	I don't know.
7549623	7550403	Betamax.
7551084	7554947	Anyhow, let's take a minute to open up ye olde mailbag and see what you guys have to say.
7555007	7557909	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orange launch radio dot com.
7558529	7561231	We rip open the email bag and see what you guys have to say.
7562953	7563393	Nothing.
7563593	7564013	No mail.
7564614	7565254	That's a lie.
7565294	7566675	I saw at least three in there earlier.
7566736	7567676	There's three.
7567916	7568477	All right.
7569697	7571299	Sup, lords of OLR?
7572501	7579449	As you maybe know, I listen and wrote this misg to the podcast on my iTouch.
7580591	7585317	Last Sunday, I wept because I tried to listen live on allgames.com, but it didn't work.
7585537	7586258	Frowny face!
7587399	7591682	How can you guys broadcast live to iTouch and hell, even PSP listeners?
7592223	7598828	Other than that, I told you I got Endwar last week and beat it in five hours and lied to Blockbuster about it being broken.
7599048	7600729	LOL, I'm just cheap like that.
7601570	7608615	The game was basically Company of Heroes on the PC with mic support, which was state-of-the-art and worked.
7608875	7611938	My brother just picked up four cake-ass games today.
7612398	7613519	Random capitalization.
7614260	7616827	And this weekend is gonna kick ass too.
7617448	7622181	The games were Gears of War 2, GTA 4, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, and Lost Planet.
7623396	7625518	I've got an ass ton of games to play.
7625938	7628060	I'll tell you what I thought of them next time.
7628461	7630983	Until the next email you hear from me, goodbye.
7631623	7633385	This is from RJ.
7633405	7647157	I am going to say this, given how much texting I do on my iPhone, it is possible to capitalize and use proper grammar and spell shit correctly.
7647498	7649560	Especially when it fixes it for you!
7651184	7664707	Other than that, really the only way to really listen to the podcast through your iPod or iPhone is going to be to download the podcast.
7665367	7666887	We don't have it available live.
7667928	7671889	And the PSP is the... I thought we had a live player on PSP.
7672909	7673289	We do.
7673329	7675149	You have to be on the PSP to see it, though.
7676390	7676990	So, yeah.
7677950	7678390	You got to.
7680515	7681135	Next email.
7685497	7689139	Read me here with greetings to the three hosts and ferret.
7689259	7691020	The ferret says hello as well.
7693516	7696398	I'd like to take this particular email to hype a game.
7696978	7700620	It's not necessarily about the gameplay itself, but more the experience.
7701080	7703421	I initially meant this towards Sky and DarkSakura.
7703561	7707083	Loki may not get it, but he may be mildly amused.
7707563	7709865	But I thought, oh well, let's get your listeners in this.
7710525	7717509	Before I say the name of the game, I'd like to ask for any chatroom listeners who have played it to not spoil anything about the game.
7717929	7719690	Yes, that was in caps, so I screamed it.
7720330	7720770	Thank you.
7721291	7723272	The name of the game is Aversion.
7724193	7727615	To compel everyone to play this simple game, here are a few reasons.
7728215	7731297	It's free and played on your PC with low system requirements.
7731417	7732238	It's two hours.
7732658	7734759	It's a platformer, but it's not very hard.
7735160	7737581	And lastly, it's cute with a secret.
7738682	7739883	Ooh, Navy Seals.
7740843	7745667	and again, it's meant to be an experience and worth it for the true ending.
7745687	7746908	Again, there are two endings.
7747689	7748870	Here's the link for everyone.
7749650	7759799	It's zarat.us z-a-r-a-t dot u-s slash t-r-a slash offline dash games slash eversion e-v-r-s-i-o-n dot h-t-m-l Hold on.
7766084	7766424	Sorry.
7767365	7768526	I'm dying here and
7770816	7771656	They're doing other things.
7773837	7774758	He's working on Justin TV.
7774778	7777319	Because it says it's working, but it's not working.
7779840	7780981	It's the phantom working.
7783902	7785263	See, Seth is a cheap bastard.
7785303	7786323	I'm just, you know...
7797984	7800726	See, that's why you have to switch it to one round per battle.
7812975	7818921	Extra credit to Sky if he'll make a video of himself playing the game blind, never playing it before, not literally blind.
7819262	7820303	Now I'm going to poke his eyes out.
7821464	7825508	With audio commentary and uploading it to the neglected OLR YouTube channel.
7825668	7826389	Just saying.
7827450	7831154	Although it's not worth it if someone doesn't elicit the proper reaction.
7832853	7842296	And a random question, will OLR support the DSI with podcast in AAC format for those too lazy to convert them from MP3?
7843196	7844816	I'll give you the generic answer, maybe.
7846297	7847517	Thank you for your response.
7847617	7848737	You're welcome for your response.
7848997	7851898	This email brought to you by The Mirror Room from Silent Hill 3.
7853379	7855019	With a weird scrunchy face.
7857240	7858280	Last email!
7860180	7861881	Mike in Australia again.
7863187	7869934	I just wanted to say thank you to Rob and all in chat a fortnight ago that recommended Chrono Trigger.
7870394	7877121	Although it's not a game I generally would play, I got the game on Rob's and the OL Army's recommendation and have been really enjoying it.
7877701	7881605	Might have to try Super Metroid if Rob picked it as the number one game above Chrono Trigger.
7887552	7893936	If there's any other DS games you can recommend, regardless of type of game, I would like to hear your suggestions.
7894256	7898818	Hope everyone in the OLR world is doing well and look forward to getting the podcast updated soon.
7899339	7899619	Thanks.
7900940	7908464	Um... Well, I know I've said this, but Castlevania Order of Ecclesia is a lot of fun.
7909925	7911786	I do really like Cooking Mama.
7912366	7913767	Um... Um...
7915658	7919584	There is, of course, the Western release, Elite Beat Agents.
7919624	7925111	You can maybe find Osatatakai Oendan or Oendan 2 from Japan.
7927964	7930365	There's a number of good RPGs out there.
7930385	7932907	There's just a bunch of really good games out there.
7935348	7940812	But I do totally recommend Order of Ecclesia.
7940852	7951658	If you really want to know what I'm playing, I'm grabbing my DS case right now while Rob is fixing Justin TV and I'll let you know what the hell's in it right now.
7952599	7955240	Let me grab this monstrosity of a case.
7956241	7956801	Right there.
7958407	7975721	Which, of course, half of them fell down Sorry, if you hear the random noises, I'm trying to fix JustinTV I'm not having much luck, though I think I just lost a game in your couch, Rob I think us trying to upgrade the encoder thing Dan finally did it Broke JustinTV, so I don't know With Dan!
7975821	7977122	Dan beat Seth with Dan!
7979193	7979473	Nice.
7979633	7987835	And of course, right as Dan beats the game with Dan, I can't get stupid Justin TV to work.
7987895	7988375	I'm pissed.
7988935	7991395	If I ever meet someone named Seth, I'm just going to punch him in the face.
7993256	7994436	I think I know why.
7995576	8003038	Well, anyway, the games that are currently in my case at this point in time, and maybe this will give you an idea.
8004318	8004498	Yes.
8005084	8008265	Oh, Dan's got a fun ending with Blanca, a.k.a.
8008766	8010726	Jimmy, and Sakura, and Ryu.
8012967	8013988	Oh my god, spoilers.
8015108	8015968	I'm not going to say anything else.
8016709	8027613	So the games in my case right now are Final Fantasy VI for Advance, Polarium, Trauma Center, Ragnarok DS is currently in my DS.
8028733	8050641	I have Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, Cooking Mama 1 and 2, Puyo Puyo Fever, or sorry, Puyo Pop Fever, Animal Crossing Wild World, Osutatakai Oendan, and Doctor Who Top Trumps from the UK, which given that you're in Australia, I'm sure that you won't have a problem getting that.
8050801	8054682	So that's what's currently in my system right now.
8055502	8057283	So maybe that'll give you some ideas.
8059822	8060743	By the way, I want to go back.
8060783	8067409	Since I was futzing with JustinTV, I wanted to kind of correct one thing one listener was saying, and that was about being able to listen to Orange Launch Radio on your iPhone.
8067830	8068770	Oh, here's the other game.
8068810	8070432	You actually can listen live.
8070552	8072033	You have to use an app like Tuner.
8072634	8073375	Tuner's what I use.
8073395	8079821	That's a pay app, but I know there's a free one as well out there that you can use to tune in to All Games Radio when we're live on Sunday night.
8079861	8082923	So you can listen on the phone, iPhone, just like you can on the PSP.
8083044	8084345	I just wanted to correct that.
8085135	8087838	The other game that's in here, the one that I lost to your couch?
8087878	8088078	Yes.
8088298	8089339	The world ends with you.
8089580	8092302	Oh, you don't want to lose... I mean, you do want to lose that one to my couch.
8092342	8092743	No, I don't, Rob.
8092783	8093503	I get to play.
8094424	8094785	Woo-hoo.
8097395	8102899	So, anywho, I'm just looking at the new website, the OL Army Picks, and I finally see the Asakura vs. Dan.
8102919	8104060	That's not the greatest quality, though.
8104380	8107763	If Justin TV stays down, we'll try to make a YouTube after the show.
8109704	8111466	Like a 10-minute review of Street Fighter 4.
8111546	8112827	Maybe that could be a fun thing we can do.
8113247	8113567	I don't know.
8113908	8115889	Loki's trying to work like mad to get Justin TV back up.
8115909	8116510	We'll see what happens.
8117330	8121673	Anyhow, meanwhile, if that does it for the mailbag, I'm going to say, send us more mail.
8121794	8123034	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8123775	8128557	Also, if I'm not over this by next week, someone else is reading Mailbag.
8129437	8129757	We'll see.
8129957	8132058	I can always do that, I guess, if my cold goes away.
8132718	8139081	Loki, we've got a couple more news stories and we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8139141	8140201	Not just yet, almost there.
8140761	8141922	A couple more news stories for you guys.
8143407	8144648	Yeah.
8167950	8168290	Spyro and Crash
8192124	8209141	stuff that they can make multiple releases for well EA picked it up and now Activision wants money so I don't get how that's possible but okay and it's actually funny because EA had put out a comment too about it as well um
8210478	8212318	regarding the whole Brutal Legend thing.
8212739	8218640	They attributed it to, it's like, you know, we doubt Activision would try to sue.
8219060	8224081	That would be like a husband abandoning his family and then suing after his wife meets a better-looking guy.
8225241	8227222	That's the most awesome comparison I've ever heard.
8227282	8229542	But, I mean, it makes, you know, what they're saying makes sense.
8229562	8235664	It's kind of like, well, you guys didn't want to put out this game, so we're giving him an outlet, and now you're saying, no, you can't do it.
8236024	8236964	It's weird.
8237664	8237824	Yeah.
8239286	8239827	They want money.
8240347	8242309	They do, but then why won't they just put out the game?
8243369	8244971	Because they're afraid of someone else making money.
8245551	8246111	It's weird.
8246331	8247012	The whole thing's weird.
8247372	8252276	Yeah, basically saying that they were still in talks with them about putting out the game.
8252516	8253176	Well, too bad.
8253617	8259221	Or is that one of the things that's like, oh, well, shit, if it's going to be such a big deal, maybe we should put out this game after all.
8259761	8260282	You know, well...
8260990	8261631	Yeah, exactly.
8261671	8268277	It's like, oh, well, we were in talks, you know, but that's like saying, you know, I was about to buy a car and some guy, you know, I've been dicking around.
8268457	8270399	Oh, I'm looking around at some other things.
8270419	8271420	I may buy that car.
8271440	8272421	I'll let you know.
8272481	8274243	And then some guy comes in and buys the car.
8274623	8276965	I'm not going to go sue the guy because he bought my car.
8277606	8284072	If you dick around for it, you know, and you didn't think that you thought that Spyro would do a lot better than this, which.
8284893	8295225	I can tell you right now when they made that announcement originally, I was like, are you fucking kidding me that they're going to drop Ghostbusters and Brutal Legend because they want Spyro and Crash?
8296086	8296406	What?
8297567	8299670	So in other words, stop dicking around, Activision.
8299710	8300591	Stop being retarded!
8302461	8303743	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8317858	8319938	All right, our old buddy Bobby wants to make a point here.
8319999	8326240	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, Activision doesn't want to publish it, but they want the money for it like they got from Atari for Ghostbusters and Riddick.
8326560	8329240	Yeah, Atari paid Activision for the rights to publish the game.
8329640	8332541	EA is not paying Activision to publish Brutal Legend.
8334041	8335502	EA is not that beat down yet.
8337482	8339142	It'll be interesting to see what comes of this.
8339862	8340242	We'll see.
8341043	8342863	Sadly, the person that's going to get hurt here
8344141	8347682	The folks behind Brutal Legend, including the same gentleman who was responsible for Psychonauts.
8349343	8349623	Bummer.
8350003	8350843	It'll get published.
8351243	8351863	Eventually.
8352063	8353584	It was never going to be a big hit.
8353704	8354824	I hate to tell you this.
8354904	8357065	It's a nichey title.
8357125	8359085	It's not going to sell a gajillion copies.
8359525	8361606	And that's why Activision passed on it.
8363087	8366548	But I mean, the thing is, you've got to go with the...
8368646	8373308	The safe titles, and then you gotta go with the titles that are gonna get you some acclaim.
8374308	8384751	And, you know, EA is kind of learning that, because they went from doing all the safe bets, all the time, and everybody was like, fuck EA, their games are horrible.
8385132	8388853	I mean, what else can they spew out of us besides EA Sports and crap?
8389173	8395115	And then they started bringing out all these great games, like Dead Space, and Mirror's Edge, and...
8396434	8406424	These games that have kind of more limited audiences, but they're getting EA some recognition as, hey, I remember when EA could make a game.
8406744	8409987	I freaking sold a copy of Mirror's Edge last week, practically.
8410568	8411829	You remember Matt was here last week.
8411869	8415512	We played the demo after the show, and he totally was like, oh, I got to get this game.
8415532	8416173	This is awesome.
8416533	8417935	I was like, I sold a copy of Mirror's Edge.
8417975	8419216	Where's my sales money?
8419316	8420617	It's a fantastic game.
8420837	8421078	Yeah.
8421838	8424519	You know, they're gonna build new franchises.
8424579	8436482	And Activision sold their future franchises for old, tired franchises that aren't with the developers that made them famous anymore and are pieces of crap.
8436942	8438843	You know, Crash is done.
8439203	8443264	I mean, yeah, every Crash game is gonna sell 250,000 copies.
8443704	8444664	It's consistent.
8444984	8446425	The kids know the brand.
8446545	8448105	I sold a Crash game the other day.
8448465	8449286	It hurt my heart.
8449426	8450066	But, you know...
8450745	8451786	Crash of the Titans.
8452306	8453787	Oh, that's family entertainment.
8454268	8459551	You know, but you look at like this Ghostbusters game, which has had screenshots out for like, what, a year?
8460012	8462674	I have demo discs saying that I could get it last October.
8463134	8464395	It looked great then.
8465776	8469238	And Atari, I think, is going to have a hit on their hands that they need.
8469699	8475943	And maybe they can break out of that, you know, yeah, we make Dragon Ball Z and it keeps us in business.
8475983	8477965	We're up that they've been in for the last few years.
8479935	8481416	Yeah, BlackWolf brings up a good point.
8481436	8483757	It still has the Ghostbusters lanyards from PAX.
8484217	8486778	All of us that went to Penny Arcade Expo, our lanyards were Ghostbusters.
8487038	8490100	That was like the day before they pulled the plug on it.
8490660	8496463	You know, and really, Activision, just for whatever reason, they sent out the nicest little Ghostbusters pre-sale kit.
8496823	8499844	It came with an Ecto-1 license plate that I shanked.
8500225	8504306	It came with Ghostbusters lanyards, a demo disc, a t-shirt.
8504687	8507268	I mean, it was a nice little kit, and the box looked like a trap.
8508689	8512491	and it had like goo oozing out and it says do not open until October 2008.
8513171	8514812	It's pretty sick.
8514892	8515753	You know, you got to wonder.
8515853	8520676	It's just like why put all that energy into it and then just be like, oh yeah, we got Blizzard on our side now.
8521136	8521976	F this game.
8522537	8527299	I mean, Activision published Ghostbusters back in the day for the NES and the Sega and the Commodore.
8527659	8530721	You know, you figured it would be, you know, poetic that they're going to carry it on.
8531702	8532662	No, not so much.
8533282	8533883	We're going to let it go.
8534562	8535102	I'll just let it go.
8535763	8536623	It's kind of weird.
8538524	8544127	It'll be just like Psychonauts where it'll be that game nobody buys when it comes out except for the enlightened few.
8544688	8554973	The unwashed masses don't understand it, won't get it, and then it'll be expensive on the secondary market if somebody who wants to be newly hardcore figures out that it's out there and has to get their hands on it.
8556594	8556934	You know.
8560236	8561917	It'll be one of those titles.
8563698	8564078	All right.
8564744	8566385	Well, we got one more news story for you guys.
8566405	8571828	We're going to open up the Skype line, take some quick calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8571849	8574390	And it's about the Beatles game that's coming out later this year.
8576451	8577812	It's not rock band Beatles.
8577872	8580714	It's just the Beatles that will probably look a lot like rock band.
8581054	8585597	Well, finally, we have some insight as to what this game might be like, and it's from an interview with Entertainment Weekly.
8585637	8593082	It's Paul McCartney actually has talked about the Beatles music game, saying 45 Beatles songs will be in this game from different periods of the Beatles' histories.
8594023	8598771	including early days tracks, Liverpool, Psychedelic, and on from there.
8599131	8601836	Because you know McCartney really knows what this game is all about.
8602779	8605640	I'm sure these are going to give you deep, compelling gameplay tidbits.
8626744	8627845	You know what, though?
8628105	8629646	This could be pretty awesome.
8629847	8632689	I mean, the Beatles... Oh, this is necessary.
8632709	8633810	This is so necessary.
8633830	8634650	This is necessary.
8634931	8640215	Next to Rock Band Journey, this is the most important title they could possibly do.
8640916	8642857	No, I made a bad faux pas.
8642877	8644138	George is the one that's dead.
8644178	8645860	I meant Ringo Starr, not George Harrison.
8645880	8647781	George Harrison has control from hell.
8647841	8649603	Ringo's got nothing.
8656721	8659262	And actually, it's, you know, Yoko.
8660122	8661443	Yoko's got all the power.
8661723	8663003	McCartney's got all the money.
8663763	8666124	And Ringo's like, I was a beetle once.
8669485	8670285	Sorry about that.
8673066	8675127	That's alright, your British accent is probably better than mine.
8676108	8679069	But anyway, yeah, this is a game that's very, very necessary.
8679129	8684813	Because there hasn't been a big Beatles thing for this generation, you know what I mean?
8685373	8689775	These kids today don't have anything to respect the Beatles with, if that makes any sense.
8689795	8690516	Across the universe.
8691036	8691796	I only count that.
8720467	8723289	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8748083	8748903	Thank you for watching!
8767680	8770722	War on the scale of what was going on during that time.
8770863	8771283	Listen to me.
8772264	8774265	We don't know war of that type.
8774345	8779269	We don't have people being drafted and forced to go into a war that they don't believe in.
8779789	8784213	We don't have, you know, being stuck in such...
8785033	8799479	And true, we do have the religious right trying to keep us in that phase, but we're going from a time of completely stodgy, everyone's the same, into complete individualism and a massive revolution.
8800119	8803140	We're not talking the message, we're talking the music and the band.
8803220	8804621	The music is the message.
8819833	8821114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8846952	8852256	You can't get it on iTunes because of the big spat between Apple Computer and Apple Core.
8853057	8853637	Yes, it is.
8853957	8854378	Yes, it is.
8854758	8858861	But, you know, I don't think it's going to matter because I think everybody's parents are going to buy it.
8859001	8862544	I think all these kids, I think the parents are all going to buy this stuff up.
8862584	8864145	And even some of the kids, enlightened kids.
8864465	8869689	Although I got to say, though, a lot of, you know, you said earlier a lot of the bands we grew up on were influenced by the Beatles.
8870049	8874693	A lot of these bands today I hear in interviews, I've heard a lot of them say they were influenced by David Bowie.
8874953	8876154	This is not a bad thing at all.
8879139	8884122	Yeah, I'm just, you know, I'm looking forward to Rock Band The Beatles or whatever it's going to be.
8884963	8889366	Except for the fact that they're probably going to screw us and won't let us import the music into Rock Band 2.
8889886	8892208	But, well, I mean, come on, you know you want to do it.
8892248	8894929	Like, the ACDC, that would be the only thing that made it worth buying.
8895450	8900213	Is the fact that I could just dump it all into Rock Band, you know, and add to this stupidly awesome playlist already, but...
8901193	8928004	I want to see from the standpoint of someone who works in the absolute bowels of the industry I want to see how this game is going to sell when it gets to stores because there's not really any buzz about it I don't have people standing in line to reserve the Beatles I don't have people standing in line to reserve even Guitar Hero Metallica I think the Guitar Hero fad is kind of starting to die and like I said earlier in the show how to run a franchise into the ground I think that
8928724	8930005	I think they're barking up the wrong tree.
8930025	8930645	Who influenced the Beatles?
8958001	8958622	See, that's the thing.
8959163	8960364	It's just the passage of time.
8960545	8965611	We don't know why they became what they became.
8965932	8967113	I influenced the Beatles.
8967474	8969216	Drugs influenced the Beatles.
8969657	8971640	What bands did the Beatles listen to?
8971660	8974283	I know we could go on the internets and look it up and find out.
8975104	8976305	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8993482	8993922	Thanks for watching!
9018155	9019836	A couple comments from chatroom I gotta read.
9019856	9025558	Chat.orangeonradio.com Blackwolf says, I don't want it to be something that I can say, hey, I wish I could just import these into Rock Band.
9025938	9029739	I hope it's different enough to see it on its own merits rather than just another track pack.
9030099	9031420	Sure, and that's cool.
9031900	9034241	But once you're in a party setting...
9035345	9054712	and you want to play some Beatles and then you want to play some KC and the fucking Sunshine Band and you want to play some Metallica and you want to play some Who and you want to play some this and you want to play some that, you're not going to bust out the Rock Band 2 disc that has 500 songs on it and put in the Beatles disc that has 40 songs on it to play a couple songs.
9054792	9057633	It's going to sit on the shelf if you're hardcore enough to own it.
9058662	9060443	Unless they do a disc swap thing like SingStar does.
9060984	9061704	That could happen.
9061764	9065027	But still, you don't jump up and just go, I'm going to switch discs, yes!
9065367	9068891	You're going to be like, man, I'm going to play some other song.
9069171	9071193	Well, I mean, SingStar's awesome.
9071773	9075877	And Bullymania in chat says, SingStar ABBA went back in time and influenced the Beatles.
9076317	9076517	Yes.
9077458	9084164	Remember, though, when we used to play... We used to play... What the hell game was it?
9085525	9089409	No, Beat Mania, when we used to switch out our appendisks.
9089889	9090950	Oh, yes, the appends.
9091211	9092091	We were all into it.
9092272	9093593	It was kind of a pain in the ass, though.
9093613	9094294	That is a good point.
9094314	9097496	But it was all we had, and now there's a better way.
9098057	9098657	I will own...
9100782	9103604	The Beatles, whether it's the rock band Beatles, whether it's what.
9103644	9107007	Because I'm of not that generation, but the generation after.
9107027	9113371	And I have the Beatles on my iPod, even though I don't own any vinyl.
9113892	9118155	And I like the music, especially some of the later stuff.
9118175	9120016	The earlier stuff just doesn't do it for me.
9120457	9122198	But it's just like you know they're important.
9122278	9125501	You know you should own it if you're into...
9126838	9138244	If you're into the niche, and I mean it's not really even a niche, but if you're into the part of the industry which we are, which is music games, if you own Drumania controllers, you should probably own this fucking game.
9139245	9142867	And if you don't, it's going to depend on how big of a Beatles fan you are.
9143783	9147845	Unless they completely bastardize it, which is a possibility, sadly.
9147985	9148806	Which totally is.
9148846	9150647	But I don't really believe that.
9151107	9153108	With Yoko having control, I don't believe it either.
9153569	9155790	Well, it's not just Yoko having control.
9155810	9160733	Because take Yoko and John Lennon and the Dead Beatles and the Living Beatles and all that out of it.
9162093	9162654	Harmonix...
9163760	9170303	is going to have such reverence for the source material that there is no possible way.
9170544	9170844	That's true.
9170904	9173105	If they fuck it up, there will be no forgiveness.
9173165	9173745	Yeah, exactly.
9174065	9180809	If they mess it up, there will be torches and pitchforks and people will be dying.
9181980	9206637	and I mean well that's you laugh but I mean that's all there is no that's true it's very true it's gonna be brutal the fallout plus you know I mean if you thought the ET game fallout was bad no yeah well and there's there's money being thrown at this I mean this this is an expensive project for EA this is uh this is a deal breaker for Harmonix if if they mangle this you know it's it's over
9206977	9207978	But Actdeft has a point.
9208038	9209719	Harmonix never ever fails to deliver.
9209759	9214163	Harmonix has very rarely failed in any way, shape, or form.
9214723	9217445	Amplitude was a little disappointing after Frequency.
9217505	9220948	And I know I'm going to get some people being like, F you, pal, for that!
9221268	9222890	But Frequency was just better.
9223490	9249266	Alright, F you pal Alright, we're going to open up Hey, if you want to tell Dan F you pal to his face F me You can call in right now Flip off your monitors, I'm flipping myself off 1877 Amplitude was a great game 1877 game OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio And you can tell Dan to F off right now Let's open up the Skype Let's open up the phones, we have a caller on the line Hi, who's this?
9250606	9253188	Hi, this is Spazinator Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
9255100	9261562	Just two or three really quick things regarding tonight's show.
9263483	9273565	Regarding the whole using of trained cats for advertisement, what if something goes wrong with the cats?
9273625	9278767	What if there's like a catastrophe?
9278867	9279427	Using the what?
9280827	9282428	Using the trained cats for...
9283694	9287397	The advertisement you mentioned in part A, I believe, of the show?
9287417	9289219	I'm sorry, what was that?
9302202	9326302	I said PETA's gonna write a nasty letter for one I don't know, I guess, I'm assuming these things are under watch I don't think they just have these kitties all roaming the streets aimlessly I mean, there's gotta be something where they've got the cats tracked somehow or the cats are, they're being watched which seems like a lot of fucking work for a stinking ad campaign but there's gotta be something they're doing
9326562	9327723	No doubt, that's easily.
9327763	9331026	I don't know if I was like, I don't know if I had a mic when you guys were talking.
9331046	9332166	Yeah, I was playing Street Fighter.
9332587	9334608	Yeah, that's the worst thing I've ever heard.
9335849	9338271	I don't understand what the point is.
9338752	9341814	Most people see a cat running around and they're just like, hey, it's a cat.
9341914	9346658	I mean, I suppose if I saw a cat wearing a Fear t-shirt, I'd be like, hey, it's a cat wearing a t-shirt, but I wouldn't go, man.
9347098	9348359	Fear, I gotta buy that fucking game.
9348379	9350080	That gets me in the mode to play some MF in 360.
9350180	9350301	Yes!
9352302	9355083	Secondly, I know that you guys have been complaining about the wind out there in California.
9355103	9356123	It could be a whole lot worse.
9379545	9389302	Um, I don't know if you guys have been paying attention to the news as of late within basketball days, but, uh, just in my, you know, my, in the neck of the woods, uh,
9389830	9393372	We just hit kind of a semi-major plane crash.
9393512	9395033	You live in Buffalo, don't you?
9395393	9396134	I just remembered.
9396794	9398135	You got this all wrong, by the way.
9398275	9401977	We probably actually kind of like the wind, because wind is cool.
9402377	9405919	We hate the fact that at the sign of a stiff breeze, our internet goes down.
9407500	9410902	People forget how to drive, and shit starts falling over.
9410922	9413384	The storms here are nothing compared to the East Coast.
9413404	9414945	I'll tell you, nothing compared to the East Coast.
9414965	9416025	We don't have hurricanes here.
9416065	9417446	If we had a hurricane here, we'd all die.
9417586	9418207	We would be dead.
9430286	9441334	Seriously, this... I swear, it's... I really don't have a problem with driving in wind because I have driven in heavy wind.
9442075	9445257	It's just seeing how many people can.
9445297	9447498	People running around with chickens with their heads cut off.
9447558	9448119	It's nuts.
9448700	9454341	But anyway, yes, I definitely have seen the news and I heard about that plane crash in Buffalo and just what a tragedy.
9454381	9458102	I mean, there's really no other word to describe it because nobody was drunk.
9458202	9459343	It wasn't carelessness.
9459383	9463624	It was at least, you know, everything I've heard says it was, you know, it was an ice thing causing a malfunction.
9463644	9468345	You know, it was just a tragedy and very, very sad.
9468365	9471746	But yeah, I mean, I can just imagine there's just reporters and the media and
9472206	9473087	and DarkSakura.com
9487541	9490021	and not have anyone get killed on like every flight.
9490081	9491802	Just some sort of goddamn miracle worker.
9491882	9492362	I guess.
9492382	9493922	That guy is from California, by the way.
9493962	9497763	He's from the wonderfully named town of Danville.
9497943	9498563	I remember that.
9498663	9499223	I heard about that.
9499263	9499643	So, there you go.
9499763	9506344	Spaz, I'm really sorry to hear about that, but hopefully it's, I mean, you're calling us, so you must be okay and that wasn't in your neck of the woods, so I'm glad to hear that at least.
9508125	9515626	Before I let you guys go, would you be ready if I give a really, really quick shout out to my link showing Final Fantasy XI?
9517078	9517779	Sure, why not?
9517819	9519180	We've had a lot of plugs tonight.
9519300	9519781	Go for it.
9519881	9521182	Shout out Suck, don't do it.
9522002	9539196	Yeah, I just want to say hi to Doc Fury, Link John, the Alexander server, specifically Nagi and Meg and Axel Zero and everyone else on Lizzy Techist who is online right now.
9539657	9541018	Just want to say hi to everyone.
9541440	9542641	Alright, shout out you guys.
9542701	9543922	Now go play a real MMO.
9544042	9544542	No, I'm kidding.
9544642	9545463	I'm so kidding.
9545483	9547845	Dude, you so stole the words out of my mouth.
9547865	9550967	I'm going to be like, now please sell your copies.
9551007	9555510	You know I'm just bitter because I spent so many years on Final Fantasy XI, but you know what?
9555590	9557372	I've heard they made a lot of good changes for the better.
9558012	9564477	I need to not give it shit, but I would like to see them, you know, because Final Fantasy XI is over, like what?
9564497	9565498	It's almost six years old now.
9565618	9567199	The benchmark program is awesome.
9567359	9568540	I would like to see them do a new one.
9569521	9574144	My and Jamie's new computers absolutely destroy the Benchmark program.
9574184	9576025	The Benchmark program is awesome.
9576045	9577226	It's just loaded with Tarot Tarots.
9577306	9581649	I know, they're just like... I will say, Final Fantasy XI did bring us Tarot Tarots.
9582129	9583730	All right, Spazinator, we're going to let you go, buddy.
9584731	9585191	I'm sure.
9585231	9585692	Sounds good.
9585832	9586312	Have a good one.
9587473	9587773	Later.
9588473	9594077	And yes, I'm reminded by the chat room that the Hello Kitty Online beta opened yesterday, so that's something I might need to check out.
9594638	9595738	Hello Kitty, Bob.
9595878	9597900	There's the MMO you ought to be playing.
9599983	9601644	Hello Kitty, Jason, Clan Member 3000 Hello Kitty, Jason, Clan Member 3000
9627896	9632321	Kitty Clutch Clan Are you responsible for what's happening with the Black DS?
9634003	9640872	Because I don't think that's right I'm going to back away slowly from these comments Jason, please put our show back on track What do you want to talk about tonight?
9641343	9643284	That confused me a whole lot, but that's okay.
9643644	9652306	It's interesting that Dan talks about that pilot that did the water landing being brought up in California because our news was all over the place because he went to school in Colorado.
9652646	9654967	That's why he's good.
9655227	9657348	Because he moved somewhere else and learned something.
9660008	9661629	What did you call in to talk about tonight, Jason?
9662827	9675757	Did people really believe that Nintendo on... You mentioned in Part A that the whole 3D room environment of the Wii when it was still codenamed The Revolution and all that.
9675957	9677338	Did people seriously believe?
9677578	9679320	You know there was people that believed it.
9679660	9684704	And I will even admit, for like... There was a period of five minutes where I kind of wished it was true.
9685004	9685925	It wasn't true...
9687440	9693863	Actually, there's something really funny you can say about that because the first five minutes of the trailer, you can completely believe.
9694023	9697224	The first half of that trailer was beautiful.
9697805	9700346	It was amazing.
9700826	9702146	Go ahead, Dan.
9702167	9705208	We just believed that Nintendo was going to fuck us up for life.
9705908	9708930	They were going to come out with something that was so badass.
9709470	9713632	Like a video game system that you play and it sucks your dick while you're doing it.
9713732	9714232	Yes!
9714652	9718254	You just couldn't resist its awesomeness.
9718294	9720135	And then they gave us the Wii.
9720956	9724357	Because it was supposed to be totally revolutionary.
9724417	9726438	You have a system called the Revolution.
9726618	9730260	It's going to be something very awesome.
9730280	9732461	Yeah, but a game system that fucks me while I play it.
9732521	9733542	That's revolutionary.
9733562	9733702	Just
9734322	9736744	It was going to be something completely different.
9736804	9745212	And instead, we got the last generation of console again with a controller that gets grandmas don't want to play.
9745732	9748674	And that's, I guess, good for everybody.
9748694	9751157	Even grandma would play a Fuck Me Revolution.
9751197	9751757	Maybe.
9752538	9754439	But, yeah, who would Konami sue then?
9757182	9762146	Seriously, though, it's a great console for everybody but gamers.
9764065	9767327	Or it's a great concept for gamers with really low standards.
9769909	9770790	And low self-esteem.
9771530	9771850	Okay.
9773792	9777955	Well, yeah, because of course it's low self-esteem because, you know, your Nintendo keeps telling you you're fat.
9778455	9781077	Nintendo goes, you're fat, you're ugly, you're stupid.
9781117	9782238	Have you ever set that up?
9782358	9783218	Do you halfway fit?
9783278	9783699	Yes, I do.
9785245	9793752	You know, you set it up, and you make your me stand there, and he's looking all nice and confident, and then you jump on that board, and it detects what you weigh, and then the guy just sort of slouches.
9793852	9794833	And then gets fat.
9795073	9797675	And then, yeah, it starts harassing you.
9797715	9800817	I'm sorry, this is more accurate for what you are.
9801117	9801618	Exactly.
9801978	9806462	I played Brain Age, and my DS told me I was stupid.
9807903	9811446	You have the brain of an 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient.
9811506	9813988	I'm like, F you, pal.
9815114	9817216	You can't understand the word blue, stupid!
9817356	9819939	The next time I see Reggie, I'm gonna punch him in the face.
9820960	9824064	Which gets hundreds of thousands of hits on the entire webs.
9826567	9827367	So, I mean, I don't know.
9827688	9830130	It's not that what Nintendo's done isn't
9831179	9831600	and so on.
9854002	9858486	The Wii is going to take your mother out to date and then sex her.
9858826	9863390	The Wii is going to get your mom out the house so that you can have orgasmic video game experiences.
9863811	9866373	We were ready for that and what we got was the Wii.
9867113	9869315	And so, I mean, did we believe it?
9869616	9869956	No.
9870076	9871697	But did we speculate about it?
9871797	9872098	Sure.
9872698	9876401	Instead, we've got my mom who won't get off the fucking TV because she's playing Elebits.
9876622	9877502	That's what we've got now.
9877542	9879764	We didn't know it was going to be the GameCube 2, you know?
9884252	9887376	I just... You guys talking about it just made me think about that trailer.
9887676	9896686	And yeah, the first half of it was great, but as soon as it said Nintendo on, the music changed and he actually tried to make up what the system was going to be.
9898488	9899409	If... Oh, God.
9899970	9900090	The...
9901623	9902704	I don't know what to do.
9902724	9906546	I don't know how to describe the people that believe the second half of that trailer.
9906926	9909308	Mario looked like Luigi for crying out loud.
9909328	9911989	Nintendo has never done that.
9912170	9915031	Has never made concept art that looks that bad.
9915452	9916972	Mushroom Kingdom was in a forest.
9917293	9919534	The video just cut out abruptly.
9920895	9920995	And
9922541	9924381	Virtual environments don't exist.
9924441	9925742	You don't make games on it.
9925762	9929002	Well, I guess there's RPG Maker, but yeah, that made good games.
9929763	9930083	Anyways.
9931103	9934324	It was Nintendo trying to convince you that the world was going to change.
9934704	9937364	If the fanboys believe it's strong enough, it will come.
9937584	9938144	Exactly.
9938425	9941085	They were going to say, look, the 360, you think that's great?
9941445	9942785	Maybe you see what we got for you.
9942845	9949687	And that's something that Sony was the master of in the last generation, and they used that to bury the Dreamcast.
9950162	9954845	The Dreamcast is great, but wait till you see what the PlayStation 2 does.
9955145	9957126	Because the PlayStation 2 is going to mess you up for life.
9957146	9960168	And they were sort of right, but they used it to bury the system.
9960428	9963590	Nintendo just did the same thing, and it worked.
9964131	9967153	It fucking worked again from Nintendo.
9967213	9969054	Nintendo watched Sony and just learned.
9969434	9974758	They were like, look, we're going to sit out this generation with this little GameCube and we're going to put out some good games for the hardcore.
9975098	9977520	But the next generation, we're going to dominate again.
9977620	9978301	And you know what?
9978581	9979061	They did.
9979301	9980762	Because that's what Nintendo does.
9981003	9985026	They learn from their mistakes and they conquer the goddamn world.
9985726	9987608	And, you know, the DS has done it.
9987668	9991731	And I remember when the DS came out, everybody was like, wow.
9992091	9994072	They replaced the GBA with this.
9994473	9996254	This thing sucks.
9996614	9997955	And look at the DS now.
9998455	10000476	It's standard gamer equipment.
10000896	10003917	If you don't have one, there's something wrong with you.
10004897	10008639	And the Wii is kind of the same way, except for the fact that gamers own it.
10008659	10010599	And then they look at me and they go, well, what should I buy for it?
10010619	10013660	And I'm like, Mario Kart and Smash Brothers are both worth owning.
10014141	10015261	And Zelda's always fun.
10015661	10018302	And if you don't own Mario Galaxy, you may as well sell your Wii.
10018462	10019022	And that's it.
10019283	10020063	Oh, Metroid Prime 2.
10023083	10024585	That's still at least five games, I guess.
10025386	10026909	Those are all the Nintendo franchises.
10027369	10029512	Well, Jason, thank you for the lively discussion.
10029813	10033518	And also, thank you while I have you on for all the hard work you and Digman did on the new website.
10033538	10036042	It looks great, and I know the chatters are loving it.
10036222	10038946	And we're going to love it, too, when we start filling it up with articles.
10038986	10039627	We're very excited.
10040357	10041818	I know what you have to thank me for.
10041898	10043699	Dan was the one that carried that whole segment.
10043739	10046281	Deakman was the one doing the whole website.
10046641	10047922	Practically doing all the website work.
10047942	10048963	You were the one calling.
10049103	10049904	I know you helped him.
10050684	10051805	Thank you for the help.
10052145	10055647	I know Deakman probably did the biggest chunk of that, but he used to get some props.
10055808	10059150	Jason, we're going to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show.
10059170	10059850	We've got to get out of here.
10059870	10060391	We're running late.
10060411	10062532	Bye, guys.
10062552	10062992	Have a good one.
10063253	10063473	Later.
10064653	10070558	That's actually going to do it for the Skype line tonight, guys, because we've got to get out of here, especially if we're going to try and do some stuff with Street Fighter 4 afterwards.
10070578	10073601	I don't know if Justin TV is up again, but we'll at least maybe try to get YouTube or something.
10073621	10075163	No, I restarted my computer because...
10076499	10078321	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10096597	10118412	and my friends online told me to use the shift, use the S key, it still won't work I'm not worried about that because I haven't really done any actual updates with this in a while so I need to do service pack 3 and that kind of stuff but it's still kind of funny because it's annoying because all my icons disappear and then they come back and then they disappear and come back and disappear and come back
10119352	10120893	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
10139127	10139867	Flash Media Encoder to work.
10166976	10168857	Alright, wow, a night with no last minute stories.
10169637	10171498	Then we'll go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
10171698	10175620	Dan, thank you so much for being here once again and contributing.
10177041	10181963	We always love your opinions and such, especially being a long time gaming fan.
10182303	10183383	Come back again sometime.
10183703	10185144	Yeah, four or five years maybe.
10185384	10186925	Alright.
10187145	10188105	I'll be here next week if you want.
10188245	10189426	Any final thoughts for listeners?
10191187	10193628	Yeah, Street Fighter 4 is absolutely legit.
10194228	10194288	Uh,
10195171	10203219	Although the Xbox controller is a way of making fighting games a... It's like slamming your dick in a door.
10203600	10204621	It's just not any fun.
10205602	10210967	So if you buy Street Fighter IV for your 360 and you're not going to invest in an arcade stick, you're high.
10212304	10215686	I'm thinking about getting it for PS3 just on the controller alone, even though I know more people on 360.
10216006	10217107	I don't know.
10217947	10222870	DarkSakura, since you're right over there, enjoy the tea and the parting gifts from me.
10223030	10224190	I so will enjoy the tea.
10224270	10224611	I know.
10224911	10225831	You've got to let me know how that is.
10225971	10230134	I might make you save me a bag, which I know is a dumpy thing to do for a gift, but I really want to try it.
10231254	10232775	DarkSakura, shut up, Dan.
10233175	10235997	DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts for listeners?
10236797	10238798	I'm glad I have tomorrow off because my voice hurts.
10239259	10240079	Rub it in, why don't you?
10241711	10242091	Loki!
10242672	10243472	Do you have any final thoughts?
10244353	10249356	No, I'm just pissed off now because Explorer keeps crashing and reinstalling.
10250556	10256260	I just have to actually go do real updates because I've been just letting it do its crappy automatic update stuff.
10256340	10264405	And my final thought is I would like to be over having clogged up sinuses now.
10265685	10266386	Alright, there you go.
10266446	10267026	Just to prove it.
10267406	10267687	Alright.
10269468	10270088	that's brisk baby
10299628	10300230	We'll do it anyway.
10300270	10303583	We'll see you here next week for Orange Lounge Radio one more time.
