17000	19000	A landmark Sony store says goodbye
19000	22000	Mario and Sonic get ported to the Winter Olympics
22000	25000	And is Namco Bandai about to acquire D3?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
33000	35000	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
35000	37000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games
37000	40000	Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
40000	41000	My name is Rob Roberts
41000	44000	And joining me every week here in the OLR Studios
44000	45000	In Sacramento, California
45000	48000	Is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
50000	53000	Who's feeling a little bit under the weather apparently
53000	54000	Yep
54000	55000	Actually, we're all under the weather
55000	56000	It's one thing, one kind of common theme
56000	57000	I've been pretty sick
57000	58000	I'm above the weather
58000	59000	I had, you're above
59000	60000	I'm over it all
60000	61000	I'm above the weather
61000	63000	No one is above the law
63000	65000	The weather is not the law
65000	66000	The weather is chaos
66000	68000	I've been kind of sick the past few days
68000	71000	I had a horrible Valentine's Day because of it
71000	74000	And Loki's a little bit sick as well
74000	75000	Say hello, Techmaster Loki
75000	76000	Loki's always a little sick
76000	78000	I'm a little sick and a little eating sandwich
78000	79000	That's right
79000	85000	And then some of the folks on Justin TV are already commenting how messy the studio looks tonight
85000	86000	Yeah, well that's what happens when you're sick
86000	87000	You don't really feel like cleaning
87000	89000	Plus, we're presented in widescreen tonight
89000	93000	So you can see even more of the mess that is usually off screen
93000	95000	I was wondering why his lightbox is in there
95000	96000	What's that?
96000	97000	I really didn't notice
97000	98000	All the crap that's around?
98000	99000	It's not that bad
99000	101000	This room has been way, way worse
101000	103000	It's usually not live during a show
103000	104000	So
104000	105000	Anyhow
105000	110000	Also joining us tonight, you know why he had so much freaking fun last week
110000	113000	He decided to come back one more time for you kids
113000	115000	Say hello to the one and only Dan the man
115000	116000	Hello
116000	117000	How are you doing, Dan?
117000	118000	Back for more
118000	120000	Did you miss us that much?
120000	121000	Yes
121000	124000	I have no place else I'd rather be
124000	125000	You're lying
125000	126000	Your internet's out at home, isn't it?
126000	127000	True that
127000	129000	Dan's internet's out at home
129000	131000	So, you know, he's here
131000	132000	Probably back on by now
132000	133000	That's right
133000	134000	But you're here
134000	135000	Nice talking to you
135000	136000	With us
136000	138000	Yeah, there's storms going on out in California right now
138000	141000	Which is, you know, for most of the rest of the world
141000	143000	The storms here are actually pretty pitiful
143000	146000	You know, compared to the rain they get like back east and stuff
146000	150000	But it's just not built out here to withstand some of the wind things we get
150000	153000	So when we get it a little windy, internet goes down left and right
153000	154000	It's pretty sad
154000	157000	People forget how to drive and start ramming their car into things that we need
157000	158000	Yes
158000	161000	Which I don't understand anyways how, you know, wind causes the internet to go down
161000	163000	Since the cables are underground
163000	165000	Sometimes, I don't know, like ours
165000	166000	Underground wind
166000	168000	Ours runs from the top
168000	170000	There's a big wire that comes down and it's weird
170000	172000	It runs like next to the phone line
172000	173000	Cable modems, son
173000	174000	Yeah
174000	177000	When they're underground, yet they still go up
177000	178000	Oh, whatever
178000	182000	Anyhow, we're going to get started tonight talking a little bit about our gaming weeks
182000	187000	And since I finally remembered the presence I got Dark Sakura like a month ago in Hawaii
187000	189000	I finally am going to remember to give her tonight
189000	193000	So I'm going to go in the house and get those while Dark Sakura tells us about her gaming week, Dark Sakura
193000	199000	I had a relatively busy gaming week despite school stuff
199000	205000	We played, I started playing City of Heroes this morning just on the trial
205000	207000	Started playing with Sauce
207000	209000	And it was pretty fun
209000	214000	You know, I picked an electric power user who was a pretty cool character
214000	219000	And of course the most fun part is actually designing your character, making costumes and stuff
219000	221000	So that was pretty cool
221000	227000	I also finished, well I
227000	232000	I'm trying to think, what all did we play last night on the Genesis Collection?
232000	236000	Last night being Valentine's Day evening
236000	239000	My husband and I decided to do something super romantic
239000	247000	And we played Xbox all night after I got us a lovely dinner prepared at Whole Foods
247000	254000	So we played a lot of Genesis Collection and some R-type dimensions
254000	258000	And I played some Symphony of the Night
258000	263000	And played a little, a couple of DS games but I don't remember what
263000	269000	Oh yeah, I downloaded and installed Perfect World but I haven't started that yet
269000	272000	So I'm thinking City of Heroes is going to be the game of choice
272000	275000	I've heard some interesting things about City of Heroes
275000	277000	I think one of us OLR peeps needs to get on that
277000	279000	That would be me
279000	280000	Go for it
280000	283000	Is it in Tiara on City of Heroes? Or was that a while ago?
283000	284000	We were playing together
284000	285000	Oh okay, cool
285000	286000	Yeah, we played together today
286000	289000	Because I know the new website is launching very very soon
289000	291000	And we're going to have Tiara hopefully doing some articles for us there
291000	293000	That'd be good, that'd be good
293000	295000	Anything else for your gaming week?
295000	296000	Not that I can think of
296000	297000	Then how about presents?
297000	298000	I like presents
298000	299000	Alright, some presents
299000	301000	I'm going to show this to JustinTV before I give it to Jamie here
301000	305000	So I got Jamie an authentic hula girl for her dashboard
305000	307000	To match the one that Loki had
307000	309000	So that's from Hawaii
309000	311000	Even though these presents are like a month old I'm just now remembering to give them to her
311000	314000	And because I know Jamie's a tea drinker
314000	317000	I got her different types of tea that are very Hawaii
317000	320000	One of them is a coconut macadamia herbal
320000	321000	Ooh, yum
321000	323000	And the other one is pineapple Waikiki
323000	325000	Dude, that's great, I love pineapple
325000	328000	So there you go, some tropical teas there for a dark soccer
328000	331000	I could totally use it because my voice is dying
331000	334000	I know, I'm almost kind of wishing I brought some more home for me
334000	336000	But that's okay, I have other stuff
336000	339000	Loki, you already got your presents a few weeks ago
339000	341000	So he doesn't feel left out
341000	342000	But he got a matching hula girl
342000	344000	Anyway, tell us about your gaming week, Loki
344000	349000	You picked the perfect time when I have my mouth full of food
349000	353000	Sorry, I have to go take these presents over to dark soccer
353000	358000	Anyways, so I played lots of Grand Theft Auto IV
358000	363000	And since it's actually working on the PC
363000	368000	I've been playing around with modding the different files and seeing what that does
368000	373000	So I've been playing with making different weapons
373000	378000	And I have the typical stuff, a weapon that has way too much physical power
378000	382000	So you shoot it into somebody and they bounce around like a ping pong ball
382000	390000	Or the grenades that create an explosion that's so big that it covers a four block radius with fire
390000	394000	And kind of blows everything apart
394000	395000	And that's fun
395000	397000	So I've been doing that
397000	401000	And the game of course is very unstable when you do that, so it's been crashing a lot
401000	407000	And then just playing regular Grand Theft Auto IV on consoles
407000	409000	Doing the deathmatch stuff there
409000	412000	Actually thinking of picking up Lost and Damned this week
412000	417000	Actually I'm in a couple of them so I can try the multiplayer in that
417000	421000	And if that's really good then I may pick it up on all five consoles
421000	425000	And then that way we can play multiplayer in Lost and Damned
425000	431000	Then other stuff I've been playing, I played the Killzone 2 demo which is actually pretty good
431000	436000	Very similar to Resistance as far as I'm concerned
436000	444000	The game itself, not so much, not as hard as Gears of War of course
444000	450000	Although the game itself, the AI is very intelligent it seems
450000	454000	So I can't just easily kill them or just run up on them and stuff like that
454000	457000	But it looks cool and I think it'll be very entertaining
457000	463000	I'm not sure if I'm actually going to pick it up right away because I still haven't even played through Resistance 2
463000	466000	But maybe soon after
466000	470000	Then the other game I played was Street Fighter IV
470000	472000	And I've been playing that quite a bit
472000	476000	The game is actually quite easy to beat, obviously un-easiest
476000	480000	Because I'm no good at the game at all
480000	486000	So it was easy enough to beat on it, not as easy as some videos would make it seem
486000	488000	You can't just go high-kicking everything around
488000	492000	Because the AI is smart enough to know, hey I'm going to kick your ass now
492000	495000	Because you're just doing the same move over and over and over again
495000	499000	Some people it works like the women with the long legs of course
499000	505000	It works pretty well but it's not just like you can put on auto-fire and leave the room
505000	507000	They will kick your ass
507000	512000	But the stories are kind of neat in there, like the little anime cutscenes that they have
512000	516000	I don't know, it's not really a game I'm into
516000	519000	Just because it's a fighting game
519000	522000	Actually Tatsunoko vs Capcom was kind of entertaining for me
522000	525000	I like the little theme song though that's in there, it's kind of cheesy
525000	528000	And the voice acting, I like what's kind of cool about that is
528000	534000	After you beat the game the first time through you get an option to toggle the Japanese or English voices per character
534000	536000	Hallelujah
536000	541000	So if you like some of the English dubbing then you can go ahead and leave it English
541000	543000	Or you can just switch it to Japanese per character
543000	545000	So that's pretty awesome
545000	548000	That also has cutscenes and all the other stuff too
548000	551000	So I thought that was really cool
551000	554000	And then other than that, it's just kind of fun
554000	557000	I was playing with some of the new characters, Rufus is kind of funny
557000	560000	And then El Fuerto is pretty cool
560000	563000	Repeat what your wife said about Rufus because that made me laugh
563000	566000	Yes I was playing as Rufus and then Nellie's like
566000	568000	That looks like me but with blonde hair
568000	571000	I'm like come on, that is ridiculous
571000	573000	And Rufus is the big guy right?
573000	575000	Yeah he's the one that has his belly flap physics
575000	578000	Nellie is one of the tiniest people I've ever met
578000	581000	Her beard also totally isn't that impressive
581000	585000	She was talking about herself
585000	589000	No Rufus is like me if I were to be in a fighting game pretty much
589000	596000	What I want to see now, I want to see Rufus versus
596000	598000	Ok I'm going to go way back here everybody, ready?
598000	601000	Raiden from Fatal Fury, that's what I want to see
601000	603000	I want to see that fight
603000	605000	Just got to wait for the next round of crossover
605000	609000	Or Chang from Fatal Fury 2
609000	610000	From Art of Fighting
610000	612000	Oh and Seth is a bitch
612000	618000	Seth the final boss who has moves from all the other Street Fighter characters
618000	621000	He sucks, even on Easy as he's fucking cheap
621000	623000	Let's get some comments from our chat room
623000	624000	chat.orangelandrated.com
624000	626000	Chat is pointing out you sound different tonight
626000	628000	VSTRNSV says Loki sounds weird
628000	630000	Tigerclaw says you sound slightly deeper
630000	631000	It's because I'm congested
631000	632000	He's been sick too, like all of us
632000	634000	Literally every host in the L.R. is sick tonight
634000	636000	It's my sexy voice
636000	638000	That's ok, I feel ok
638000	641000	Just in time for Valentine's Day
641000	645000	Loki wants you to get down this week
645000	647000	With Street Fighter IV
647000	649000	I'm gonna stab women on the
649000	656000	I'm waiting by their phones for your call
656000	657000	Some comments from chat
657000	661000	Leo Shen wants to know how's Crimson Viper
661000	664000	Pretty good, I like her a lot better than like say
664000	666000	You know, Chung Li
666000	669000	Some of her moves are interesting
669000	672000	You know this is, you're asking the person's opinion
672000	674000	Who doesn't play this game, I mean hardly ever
674000	675000	I played through her once
675000	677000	How did the tits compare to Ivy?
677000	678000	That's what guys really want to know
678000	680000	You know, ok, here's the weirdest thing
680000	683000	Which fighting game has the best tits?
683000	686000	Dead or Alive, Soul Calibur, or Street Fighter IV?
686000	688000	Dead or Alive, by far
688000	690000	Soul Calibur
690000	693000	And then we'll go to, you know, Street Fighter
693000	695000	Because Street Fighter, they don't really seem to have any boot physics
695000	698000	Although, I swear to god, I saw this during like
698000	700000	A little in-game cutscene
700000	703000	Because there's a point where you have to fight your rival
703000	706000	That's the second to last character you fight before Seth
706000	710000	And, I swear to god, she was walking away and she turned
710000	712000	And her boobs snapped
712000	715000	Like, it was like, they got stuck in some place and all of a sudden it's like
715000	717000	Wham! And like went back
717000	718000	It just like threw me off
718000	721000	Because she isn't, they don't like move when you're actually fighting
721000	724000	You know, it's not, the only person that has any sort of physics like that
724000	727000	Or, that's Rufus, you know, with his big flap
727000	730000	But, um, so Rufus has booby physics
730000	732000	Rufus has booby physics
732000	735000	It's, no, it's like gut physics
735000	736000	I don't know
736000	737000	Okay
737000	738000	But, um, yeah, it's okay
738000	740000	I mean, like I said, I'm no good at Street Fighter
740000	745000	And, you know, I don't pretend to be, you know, winning any arcade game
745000	749000	I mean, hell, I lose to the computer on easiest sometimes
749000	751000	So, that's pretty bad
751000	754000	You just need to do what I do at Chun Li and just hit the kick button repeatedly
754000	755000	It doesn't work
755000	758000	Even on easiest that the like computer would be just like
758000	762000	Okay, you stop doing stuff, I'm gonna walk over and punch you now
762000	764000	No, they're actually, it's pretty hard
764000	766000	I don't know if it ramps up based on how well you're doing
766000	771000	But, you know, easiest isn't the cakewalk that I thought it should be
771000	773000	Tigerclaw in chat says
773000	777000	Every time I hear the word Rufus, the first thing on my mind is Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures
777000	782000	I was thinking Rufus Shinra, but I was, I watched that pretty recently
782000	783000	Alright
783000	786000	Um, okay, so if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week
786000	787000	Then I'll talk about mine
787000	789000	Mine was pretty much the same as Jamie's
789000	792000	I played a lot of the new Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection
792000	794000	Except I played it for the Playstation 3
794000	796000	Um, they didn't have it on 360 when I went
796000	798000	And I actually was thinking, you know what
798000	802000	For the classic games, I think I'll want the D-pad on the Playstation 3 controller
802000	805000	And why not, I don't have a lot of games that offer trophies
805000	808000	So if I feel like being an achievement whore on the PS3, why not, it makes sense
808000	809000	So I picked it up
809000	814000	And I'm pretty sure I'm getting the exact same freaking thing on the Playstation 3
814000	818000	That 360 users are getting, it's really not a big difference at all
818000	821000	Um, but overall the game collection is pretty awesome
821000	823000	I mean, you cannot beat the value
823000	826000	It's $40 for, what, no sorry
826000	830000	40 games for $30 and then like 9 unlockables in there
830000	832000	And some of the unlockables are pretty awesome
832000	836000	You get some arcade games like Altered Beast, Fantasy Zone, Shinobi
836000	840000	Which was awesome, and Dan had pointed out a fact I didn't think of before the show
840000	844000	But they have never released an official port of Shinobi Arcade for the home systems
844000	845000	I mean, you had the dumbed down
845000	849000	There have been lots of Shinobi ports, but you never see them on these collections
849000	853000	And not the authentic arcade version, like a lot of them were dumbed down for the 8-bit systems
853000	856000	Like they had Shinobi on the NES from Tengen if I remember right
856000	859000	But it was pretty dumbed down, you know
859000	861000	It was different, at least they did
861000	864000	They tried to at least emulate the actual arcade version unlike
864000	868000	Do you remember like Ninja Gaiden on the NES was completely different from Ninja Gaiden Arcade
868000	869000	But for the better in that case
869000	870000	Way better
870000	871000	Way better
871000	872000	Anyhow, random tangent
872000	876000	But I just remember being a kid like it was Shinobi over here and Ninja Gaiden over here
876000	878000	Like the two big Ninja games he had
878000	879000	So, anyhow
879000	883000	The collection is great, it's definitely worth the money
883000	887000	A slight disappointment that they didn't do more with the online functionality
887000	890000	Especially when they've had us buy this collection before on the GameCube
890000	893000	And these collection, you know, or I shouldn't say the same collection
893000	896000	But you know, Sonic games at least all bundled together and so on
896000	901000	Little disappointed that they didn't do at least leaderboards, online multiplayer
901000	903000	Something that brought in the extra functionality
903000	905000	Who knows, downloadable games
905000	909000	Why not, I mean we all noticed Revenge of Shinobi was missing from the collection
909000	913000	And some other big Genesis titles from back in the day are missing completely
913000	915000	So why not have these as like download content
915000	917000	That would be actually kind of rad
917000	920000	I, but I somehow doubt that's how they're going to do it
920000	921000	Why should they?
921000	923000	They released Sonic 1 and they released
923000	925000	Didn't the original Streets of Rage come out for download 360
925000	929000	And one of the Sonic 2 was download content for Xbox Live Arcade
929000	930000	Streets of Rage 2 dead
930000	932000	Yeah, Streets of Rage 2, not 1
932000	933000	Way better
933000	934000	Yeah, so
934000	939000	Yeah, but wouldn't it be cool if they perfected their Genesis emulator with this game
939000	943000	And then it's like virtual console but with all Genesis games on the 360
943000	946000	That's really interesting about this that you say virtual console
946000	949000	Because like seriously, if you own a Wii and a 360
949000	951000	Or a Wii and a PS3
951000	955000	Like this game invalidates the need for like almost all those Genesis games on virtual console
955000	960000	That you would have paid what 8 dollars times 40 is what 320 dollars for
960000	963000	Again for a tenth of that, not even
963000	964000	It's just amazing
964000	966000	So I don't know
966000	969000	I mean some could claim it's not 100% authentic
969000	972000	But at the same time I think it's really as close as you're going to get
972000	975000	Short of bringing out the old Genesis system
975000	978000	And blowing off the dust and hooking it up and plugging it in
978000	979000	You know what I mean
979000	981000	I don't see it ever getting any closer
981000	983000	So there it is
983000	985000	That's the reason to have a CDX though
985000	987000	For more games?
987000	989000	Because there's no CD games in this
989000	990000	No Sewer Shark
990000	992000	It's just small and easy
992000	993000	Or Nomad, you know
993000	994000	Gotcha
994000	998000	Maybe that's the next Sonic's Ultimate CDX collection
998000	1000000	And we'll have freaking Night Trap
1000000	1004000	You really want to play the Dana Plato game?
1004000	1007000	I don't know why I want to play the Dana Plato game but I do
1007000	1009000	There's microcosm in Sewer Shark
1009000	1011000	Microcosm I actually liked
1011000	1014000	There was Dragon's Lair
1014000	1016000	Where's my Jaguar collection?
1016000	1019000	Where it should be non-existent
1019000	1021000	It would just be Tempest 2000
1021000	1023000	It would just be Tempest 2000
1023000	1024000	That's pretty much it
1024000	1026000	I think there's one other good Jaguar game I can't think of right now
1026000	1027000	Defender?
1027000	1029000	Going to comments from chat
1029000	1032000	Acidic Vampire says they need some tougher achievements in that collection
1032000	1034000	Yeah the achievements are a little easy
1034000	1038000	But again that's why online leaderboard at least would have been cooler
1038000	1040000	So you have something else to obtain
1040000	1042000	Yeah the achievements are a little easy
1042000	1043000	They're a little on the easy side
1043000	1046000	Some of them will take you a little bit of determination to get
1046000	1048000	Yeah it was on the easy side
1048000	1049000	Same thing with the trophies
1049000	1051000	The trophies and achievements are the same thing
1051000	1053000	It's just that on the Playstation instead of worth points
1053000	1056000	They're worth either bronze, silver, or gold depending on what it is
1056000	1058000	But I unlocked a gold trophy easy
1058000	1061000	I got the Sonic Spinball
1061000	1063000	No maybe it's just because I love Sonic Spinball
1063000	1065000	For whatever reason don't laugh
1065000	1067000	But I got 10 million points on stage one that's all you have to do
1067000	1069000	And that's like beating stage one pretty much
1069000	1073000	This is probably unlikely but can you combine games together
1073000	1075000	Like you know with Sonic Spinball and all the Sonic games
1075000	1077000	You can do the Sonic and Knuckles stuff
1077000	1078000	Sadly no
1078000	1081000	And actually you couldn't do that with Sonic Spinball I don't believe
1081000	1082000	Yeah you can
1082000	1083000	You could play as Knuckles
1083000	1084000	No you couldn't
1084000	1085000	You could do Blue Sphere
1085000	1088000	Yeah there was something I think like one little extra thing it gave you
1088000	1090000	No you could play as Knuckles in Spinball
1090000	1091000	What?
1091000	1092000	I don't think you can
1092000	1093000	I thought you could
1093000	1094000	You think you thought wrong
1094000	1098000	My Genesis collection which I mean is not a CD for my Xbox
1098000	1100000	But it's a box full of Genesis crap
1100000	1102000	It's sitting by my TV
1102000	1105000	If you want to come on by we'll walk on
1105000	1107000	But you get something with it
1107000	1108000	You get something you get the blue
1108000	1111000	Just like all the other games it does the Blue Sphere game
1111000	1113000	Not even the complete one I think it's only with Sonic the Hedgehog
1113000	1115000	Yeah it's kind of dumb
1115000	1117000	But interesting
1117000	1121000	Let's see I'm still looking at comments in the chatroom
1121000	1124000	GameGuru says it was Sonic 2 that gave you Knuckles
1124000	1127000	Some of them gave you the extra character
1127000	1130000	Alright I guess that's it for gaming week
1130000	1133000	Unless Dan I don't know if you played some stuff that Jamie didn't
1133000	1135000	That you want to share with us but Dan do you have anything?
1135000	1137000	I've played nothing new this week
1137000	1138000	Nothing new
1138000	1140000	I'm still playing HD Remix
1140000	1142000	I played R-Type Dimensions
1142000	1145000	And I played Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection
1145000	1147000	For Shinobi mostly
1147000	1148000	There you go
1148000	1149000	And here's what I have to say
1149000	1151000	Online leaderboards suck
1151000	1153000	I don't know why you like them
1153000	1155000	All they do is serve to remind me
1155000	1157000	That the games that I think that I'm good at
1157000	1159000	I really really suck at
1159000	1161000	But it gives you something to work towards
1161000	1165000	All I know is go to the online leaderboards for R-Type Dimensions
1165000	1168000	And see the people who have beaten that game without dying
1168000	1172000	Every one of those people I want to kick in the balls
1172000	1175000	I thought I was good at R-Type I am no good at R-Type
1175000	1176000	I hate you all
1176000	1179000	There was some game it was the Midway Collection I think
1179000	1182000	One of the first that came out and it had online leaderboards
1182000	1186000	And like for a while I was in the top 10 for Wizard of War
1186000	1189000	That old ass 80's game and that made me feel pretty cool
1189000	1192000	Even though like nobody probably fucking played Wizard of War
1192000	1194000	I dominated Roadblasters on that
1194000	1196000	And the Xbox for months
1196000	1197000	See they can be fun
1197000	1199000	But you know what eventually somebody owned me
1199000	1202000	And that person when I find you
1202000	1204000	I wish I remembered your gamer name
1204000	1205000	I will kill you
1205000	1209000	Rob you did though play Streets of Rage right?
1209000	1210000	Yeah
1210000	1212000	You did listen to the pretty cool soundtrack
1212000	1214000	Yuzo Koshiro absolutely
1214000	1216000	That was like my whole incentive for playing Streets of Rage
1216000	1219000	Because I don't know I'm kind of sick of those side scrolling
1219000	1220000	I had forgotten that you did it
1220000	1221000	Oh yeah you can tell too
1221000	1222000	It's very
1222000	1225000	It's all about playing Blaze in that game though because you guys suck
1225000	1227000	Nice
1227000	1228000	Nice
1228000	1232000	Alright let's get into some housekeeping real quick
1232000	1234000	There's a couple things on the table right now tonight
1234000	1237000	If you are listening to us live on AllGames.com or on Justin TV
1237000	1239000	Hello by the way again to the Justin TV listeners
1239000	1241000	You can look at us on camera at Justin TV
1241000	1243000	I don't know why you'll want to watch a radio show
1243000	1247000	But that's what the listeners ask for so we gave it to them
1247000	1249000	Keep in mind we still don't have our issue fixed
1249000	1253000	Where you can hear all the sound that goes out over air
1253000	1255000	So you only hear what goes through the microphones
1255000	1256000	You don't hear any of the music
1256000	1258000	I forgot to bring the adapter for that
1258000	1260000	It's not a huge deal
1260000	1263000	I would hope that everybody is still at AllGames.com to get the full experience
1263000	1265000	But I know there's some people that because of firewalls and stuff
1265000	1267000	They can't so they have Justin TV
1267000	1270000	Which seems very odd to me that you would be able to watch Justin TV
1270000	1272000	But not all, whatever
1272000	1274000	Some people have claimed that happens so it's interesting
1274000	1276000	But that's interesting
1276000	1279000	The only other thing I want to say is that by the way
1279000	1281000	Speaking of Justin TV stay tuned tonight on Justin TV
1281000	1284000	Because we have something special after the show for you live folks
1284000	1287000	And if you're listening live tonight
1287000	1289000	OrangeLaunchRadio.com is down
1289000	1290000	It's not there
1290000	1293000	It's a big black screen with a Moblin that says it's a secret to everyone
1293000	1295000	Something is in the works
1295000	1297000	And if you've been listening to the show for the past couple of weeks
1297000	1298000	You know darn well what's coming
1298000	1301000	That's going to happen live tonight during the show a little later on
1301000	1304000	They're just crossing all the T's and dotting all the I's right now
1304000	1306000	While we're taping
1306000	1308000	So in the meantime you can still join us at chat
1308000	1312000	There is still a link on OrangeLaunchRadio.com to go to our chat room
1312000	1314000	That is not being affected by the side outage
1314000	1316000	Just check out OrangeLaunchRadio.com
1316000	1320000	Some folks in chat sharing their online leaderboard experiences
1320000	1326000	ActDeaf says I was at one point in the top 20 users in championship mode of Pac-Man CE
1326000	1327000	That's a tough one
1327000	1329000	That is an achievement
1329000	1330000	That is an achievement
1330000	1331000	Achievement unlocked
1331000	1333000	That is, you have a big EP for that one
1333000	1336000	Because that is not an easy game to be doing that with
1336000	1338000	So, alright
1338000	1341000	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news
1341000	1342000	And all that
1342000	1344000	And talk about what's new in the gaming world this week
1344000	1346000	Are you done with your sandwich, Lowkey?
1346000	1348000	No, I'm not done with my sandwich, but that's okay
1348000	1349000	Alright, we'll make it work anyway
1349000	1351000	The show must go on
1351000	1352000	The show must go on
1352000	1353000	With or without sandwich
1353000	1355000	Oh, let me say this real quick
1355000	1358000	I am going to give a quick shout out to our buddy Brad from Pod Culture
1358000	1361000	He started a new podcast for that show Dollhouse
1361000	1363000	I meant to watch that
1363000	1364000	I did watch it
1364000	1365000	I did watch it
1365000	1366000	Because Joss is the man
1366000	1369000	Hopefully he has more listeners than there were viewers for the Dollhouse
1369000	1371000	Oh, did it not do well on the ratings?
1371000	1374000	No, it lost to Supernanny and I will have to say
1374000	1376000	I was part of the Supernanny crowd, unfortunately
1376000	1378000	You know what, the whole...
1378000	1379000	Rude
1379000	1381000	They just can't screw this up the way they did Firefly
1381000	1385000	Hopefully it will make up some listeners on like
1385000	1387000	Or, you know, with, not listeners
1387000	1391000	Viewers from like TiVo and iTunes and all that stuff right now
1391000	1392000	It's just on a bad night
1392000	1395000	I mean, most people don't stay home and watch TV on Fridays
1395000	1399000	The whole problem is that they screwed up Firefly so bad
1399000	1402000	That people are going to have a bad impression
1402000	1404000	Those who never went back to watch the DVDs
1404000	1406000	I mean, Joss is the man
1406000	1407000	I mean, I'm serious
1407000	1409000	If you put this show on any other day in the week
1409000	1410000	I think you'll be fine
1410000	1411000	Seriously
1411000	1415000	Fox does have this tendency to give Joss Whedon the death spot
1415000	1416000	I mean, Friday nights
1416000	1419000	I mean, not to knock Fringe because I love Fringe
1419000	1421000	But if you want this show
1421000	1423000	If it's kind of tanking for you guys
1423000	1427000	Why don't you just throw, you know, Dollhouse right after American Idol
1427000	1430000	I mean, then that way you get a really big lead in
1430000	1431000	Hopefully they will one night
1431000	1433000	They'll give it a shot after American Idol
1433000	1435000	I don't know, because the show is pretty decent
1435000	1436000	Look, let me put it this way
1436000	1439000	I know I'm like the gay guy you hear on the podcast or whatever
1439000	1441000	But seriously, like, if I was straight
1441000	1442000	Elijah Dushku
1442000	1443000	You betcha
1443000	1444000	You betcha
1444000	1446000	She is pretty hot
1446000	1447000	She's very hot
1447000	1448000	Yeah, that's happening for real
1448000	1451000	So anyway, I didn't give the website
1451000	1453000	Support our buddy Brad's podcast
1453000	1455000	It's thedollhousepodcast.com
1455000	1456000	If you're a Whedon fan
1456000	1459000	You should check that out and support that show
1459000	1460000	But Joss is owned
1460000	1462000	Buffy just doesn't strike twice
1462000	1465000	He hit too big too soon
1465000	1467000	It's all downhill from there
1467000	1469000	Well, you know
1469000	1470000	Firefly was awesome
1470000	1471000	Ten times better than Buffy
1471000	1473000	And it got screwed off of TV
1473000	1477000	So I don't see what the fans are hoping for
1477000	1478000	Brad's actually saying in chat
1478000	1480000	We started a Deadpool on pod culture
1480000	1482000	About how long it'll take Fox to axe it
1482000	1485000	That's pretty morbid, but sad, but true
1485000	1487000	I know there had been talk about them actually
1487000	1490000	Doing a Faith spinoff
1490000	1492000	But this was a different idea
1492000	1495000	And I think that it was that he and Elijah Dushku
1495000	1497000	Came up with the idea together, so
1497000	1499000	Honestly, the show's not bad
1499000	1500000	It was a little hard to get into
1500000	1502000	Because I think the first episode kind of hits the ground running
1502000	1504000	But it's not bad by any means
1504000	1505000	Mark, put it on sci-fi
1505000	1506000	I mean, shit
1506000	1507000	They just got, you know, what?
1507000	1509000	Reruns of, you know
1509000	1511000	Some Stargate spinoff
1511000	1512000	I mean, seriously, just put it on there
1512000	1514000	Yeah, but Stargate Atlantis was crap
1514000	1516000	Alright, look, we gotta get into gaming news
1516000	1518000	We suddenly have turned into the nerdy podcast
1518000	1519000	Sorry
1519000	1521000	We don't want to infringe on pod culture's territory
1521000	1523000	Rock turned into?
1523000	1525000	Excuse me, what?
1525000	1526000	Turned into?
1526000	1527000	You know what I mean, alright
1527000	1529000	I watch a lot of TV during the week, okay?
1529000	1530000	That's true
1530000	1532000	Ever since I stopped playing WoW
1532000	1534000	I have watched a shitload more TV than I used to
1534000	1536000	I would never have watched All House
1536000	1538000	Before it used to be, okay
1538000	1540000	House and NipTuck or whatever
1540000	1542000	Now it's like
1542000	1544000	Like, eight shows I'm watching
1544000	1545000	It's like, too much
1545000	1546000	But anyways
1546000	1547000	Amazing Grace starts tonight
1547000	1548000	One show, one show
1548000	1549000	TiVo it, don't
1549000	1550000	Supernatural
1550000	1552000	I watched Wife Swap last week
1552000	1553000	That's how pathetic I was
1553000	1554000	Not Supernanny, but what?
1554000	1556000	I actually watched Wife Swap then Dollhouse
1556000	1558000	We don't, like, watch Supernanny religiously
1558000	1560000	It's just, if it's on, it's like
1560000	1562000	Okay, so
1562000	1564000	Rob, got more news for us
1564000	1566000	Loki wants to start us off with a story tonight
1566000	1568000	Alright, well
1568000	1570000	You know, after all the assumptions that
1570000	1572000	The viral video wasn't necessarily a viral video
1572000	1574000	And it was, you know
1574000	1576000	Or it was a viral video, but just not leaked out
1576000	1578000	Um, yeah
1578000	1580000	Apparently that video that was out last week
1580000	1582000	You know, showing zombies
1582000	1584000	In, like, a Las Vegas type of
1584000	1586000	You know, setting with
1586000	1588000	You know, a giant atmosphere and stuff like that
1588000	1590000	Yes, that was actually
1590000	1592000	Dead Rising 2
1592000	1594000	And Capcom did announce Dead Rising 2
1594000	1596000	Which will be coming out on PC, 360, and PS3
1596000	1598000	It will take place
1598000	1600000	In a brand new
1600000	1602000	City
1602000	1604000	Fortune City
1604000	1606000	It's kind of like Las Vegas
1606000	1608000	And it will be a gambling paradise
1608000	1610000	No longer will you be playing Frank West
1610000	1612000	But some guy in a jacket
1612000	1614000	And there's, um
1614000	1616000	Boo to that, I'm sorry, Frank West is awesome
1616000	1618000	Okay
1618000	1620000	But they've got, you know, different pictures
1620000	1622000	You know, they have everything from
1622000	1624000	Him beating up zombies with a giant cell phone
1624000	1626000	To a dirt bike
1626000	1628000	To a roulette wheel, so, um
1628000	1630000	But has he covered wars?
1630000	1632000	Maybe
1632000	1634000	But see, here's the thing, though, maybe
1634000	1636000	We're only talking, like, four screenshots
1636000	1638000	And everyone's assuming that Frank West is not there
1638000	1640000	Maybe Frank West is there
1640000	1642000	But maybe there's two player co-op
1642000	1644000	Maybe it's multiple characters
1644000	1646000	Maybe he's a zombie
1646000	1648000	And he's like the super zombie
1648000	1650000	And you have to run over him with a riding lawn mower
1650000	1652000	I don't know
1652000	1654000	But, hey, you know, it looks pretty awesome so far
1654000	1656000	So, um, I'm sure we'll hear more about this
1656000	1658000	During E3
1658000	1660000	I need to go back and play more Dead Rising
1660000	1662000	Because I had the first one, and that game is just fun
1662000	1664000	To just fuck around with
1664000	1666000	Well, you can not do a lot of anything
1666000	1668000	Play the sub-par Dead Rising chop till you drive
1668000	1670000	No, I can't, because I just will not be able to put up with that
1670000	1672000	After playing the 360 version
1672000	1674000	But they have new costumes
1674000	1676000	The entire fun of the 360 version
1676000	1678000	Is taking pictures while you're doing these horrible
1678000	1680000	Things to the zombies
1680000	1682000	They took that out of the Wii version, I'm sorry
1682000	1684000	But I would watch that for two player co-op
1684000	1686000	Same screen or something, I don't know
1686000	1688000	Talking about TV shows
1688000	1690000	In the chat room
1690000	1692000	And video game potential
1692000	1694000	Acidic Vampire suggests Supernanny the game
1694000	1696000	I don't know, I get the sense that would just be Imagine Babies
1696000	1698000	Or something like that
1698000	1700000	What the hell is Supernanny?
1700000	1702000	It's this show where
1702000	1704000	They call the 800 number
1704000	1706000	The producers of the show
1706000	1708000	If their kids are just out of control
1708000	1710000	You should watch this show because it would piss you off
1710000	1712000	Are they Poppins modern day?
1712000	1714000	Yes, actually the lady
1714000	1716000	Her name is Joanne or something, she's from Britain
1716000	1718000	So she has the accent and everything
1718000	1720000	She even carries a little umbrella
1720000	1722000	And she comes and she restores harmony
1722000	1724000	To the household
1724000	1726000	You know how to restore harmony to a household with unruly children?
1726000	1728000	What?
1728000	1730000	Duct tape, ceiling
1730000	1732000	Basically this last episode that I missed Dollhouse for
1732000	1734000	It had this guy
1734000	1736000	This abusive dad who's like
1736000	1738000	Slapping his kids and stuff
1738000	1740000	You can't slap the baby
1740000	1742000	That's not the way to raise your baby
1742000	1744000	And it's like an hour of that
1744000	1746000	You cannot slap your baby
1746000	1748000	I'm so glad
1748000	1750000	I don't watch that show because it sounds retarded
1750000	1752000	It's just frustrating
1752000	1754000	And you know the thing that pisses me off the most, Rob
1754000	1756000	Is watching people be stupid
1756000	1758000	That's why I like
1758000	1760000	I think your own personal hell would be shows
1760000	1762000	Like you'd be strapped to a chair
1762000	1764000	Forced to watch this and Wife Swap
1764000	1766000	And I don't know, some of these
1766000	1768000	Feel good reality shows
1768000	1770000	Feel good my ass, watching people be stupid
1770000	1772000	Is the worst form of torture ever
1772000	1774000	Do you know what I like to do?
1774000	1776000	I like to watch The Biggest Loser while eating
1776000	1778000	Oh my god, now that would be crazy
1778000	1780000	This food is so tasty and you can't have any
1780000	1782000	It's all mine
1782000	1784000	It's my chocolate
1784000	1786000	I ate an entire cup of
1786000	1788000	Low fat ice cream
1788000	1790000	Just for a medical thing I do low fat
1790000	1792000	An entire cup of low fat ice cream
1792000	1794000	Which I know makes a lot of sense
1794000	1796000	It's not really low fat when you eat the whole fucking cup
1796000	1798000	You're holding it out and going
1798000	1800000	Oh don't you want some?
1800000	1802000	It's full of sugar
1802000	1804000	Sugary goodness
1804000	1806000	It is, anyway
1806000	1808000	I'm sorry, we need to get back to gaming news
1808000	1810000	Can we please?
1810000	1812000	One place I will not be eating ice cream ever again at
1812000	1814000	Is the Metreon
1814000	1816000	And we know the Metreon here at Orange Launch Radio
1816000	1818000	We actually have a lot of very fond memories of the Metreon
1818000	1820000	I have no memories of the Metreon
1820000	1822000	Other than it used to exist because I've never been to the Metreon
1822000	1824000	Hold on, let me say it
1824000	1826000	The Metreon is not closing
1826000	1828000	But the Metreon has gone through a lot of changes in the past few years
1828000	1830000	For one, it's not owned by Sony anymore
1830000	1832000	And the reason why I say the Metreon holds a special place in our hearts
1832000	1834000	The very first Dance Dance Revolution tournament
1834000	1836000	If you've been listening to this show for any length of time
1836000	1838000	You know Dark Soccer, Loki, and myself
1838000	1840000	We all met playing DDR at the arcade
1840000	1844000	The first Dance Dance Revolution tournament I ever went to was at the Metreon
1844000	1846000	And do you remember that the Metreon
1846000	1850000	We went to the Metreon the day we decided to do the radio show
1850000	1852000	We came up with the name and everything
1852000	1854000	OLR was born on a trip to the Metreon
1854000	1856000	The third mix that was half-faded
1856000	1858000	The fifth mix that was half-faded
1858000	1860000	Yep, I remember that
1860000	1862000	At that cool little arcade
1862000	1864000	And that was when they had the little oops I went to hell store
1864000	1866000	Or whatever that chick was
1866000	1868000	Oh, I can't remember the name
1868000	1870000	Oops I went to hell store
1870000	1872000	No, the chick was on all these shirts
1872000	1874000	That say oops I just ran over or something
1874000	1876000	Or oops I had sex with your boyfriend
1876000	1878000	That was like the little niche on all these shirts
1878000	1880000	And I just remember getting one that said oops I went to hell
1880000	1881000	Oh
1881000	1882000	I don't remember the name of the character
1882000	1884000	It wasn't an Emily
1884000	1886000	I don't think so, I don't know, anyway forget it
1886000	1888000	But I've seen Nightmare Before Christmas there twice
1888000	1890000	Yeah, they have the IMAX theater and everything
1890000	1892000	Well now it's owned by Westfield
1892000	1894000	That happened a couple years ago
1894000	1897000	It got changed over, but here's the thing is that they still have the Sony store
1897000	1899000	Well, guess what
1899000	1901000	Apparently in an interview with GameSpot
1901000	1904000	Sony has said the lease for the Metreon
1904000	1907000	For the Playstation store will expire this summer
1907000	1909000	We have chosen not to renew it
1909000	1911000	They are saying the lease expires on March 31st
1911000	1914000	So the Sony store is going to be closing
1914000	1916000	It's kind of sad in a way
1916000	1918000	I mean it is and it isn't
1918000	1920000	I mean the Sony store was a little you know
1920000	1922000	A little overpriced and glamorous
1922000	1924000	I mean well they charge
1924000	1926000	They charge the same price you pay in any store
1926000	1928000	But they didn't really have sales
1928000	1930000	Or anything like that going on there
1930000	1932000	Everything was very high end or whatever
1932000	1934000	It was very nice
1934000	1936000	But it was still kind of nice that Sony had an official place
1936000	1938000	You know what I mean?
1938000	1940000	And they did all their launch parties there
1940000	1942000	There were some Final Fantasy things that went on there
1942000	1944000	It's kind of sad
1944000	1946000	It is the end of an era in a way
1946000	1948000	Anyhow
1948000	1950000	By the way speaking of the launch parties
1950000	1952000	Sony has apparently said
1952000	1954000	They are still always looking at new avenues
1954000	1956000	For additional retail exposure in space
1956000	1958000	But they felt it best not to continue with a dedicated
1958000	1960000	Playstation store at the Metreon at this time
1960000	1962000	Again if you haven't caught on yet
1962000	1964000	The Metreon
1964000	1966000	Is right off of 4th street in San Francisco
1966000	1968000	Gonna be closing
1968000	1970000	The Sony store is closing
1970000	1972000	Not the whole thing
1972000	1974000	There are a couple of other notable things about the Metreon
1974000	1976000	Apart from having a pretty decent arcade there
1976000	1978000	Is there is the
1978000	1980000	Video game
1980000	1982000	Walk of Fame
1982000	1984000	I don't know if they still have that
1984000	1986000	I thought it was still there
1986000	1988000	I don't remember
1988000	1990000	I thought it might have changed hands when it went to Westfield
1990000	1992000	But I'm not sure
1992000	1994000	It's been there since it changed hands
1994000	1996000	Was it? Okay
1996000	1998000	I haven't been since it was Sony
1998000	2000000	It's been a couple of years since I've been
2000000	2002000	And it was still Sony last time I went
2002000	2004000	I went not too long ago
2004000	2006000	You could tell the place was hurting
2006000	2008000	Because this was right when the first arcade they had closed
2008000	2010000	It was empty
2010000	2012000	It was hurting
2012000	2014000	I mean this was a couple of years ago
2014000	2016000	Before everybody said the economy was going to crap
2016000	2018000	And now just double that with
2018000	2020000	A bummer
2020000	2022000	There's not much good news left anyway
2022000	2024000	You know in other
2024000	2026000	Square related news
2026000	2028000	The Squenix boss
2028000	2030000	Yoichi Wada
2030000	2032000	Said that
2032000	2034000	Dragon Quest 10
2034000	2036000	Since it's being delayed it would cause problems
2036000	2038000	For the release of Final Fantasy 13
2038000	2040000	Well
2040000	2042000	It's just that they can't
2042000	2044000	Really be sure
2044000	2046000	If it's going to affect it or not
2046000	2048000	But Dragon Quest 9
2048000	2050000	Is going to be
2050000	2052000	Delayed from March to July
2052000	2054000	And they don't know if that's going to cause
2054000	2056000	Final Fantasy 13 to get pushed back
2056000	2058000	It's actually supposed to be out
2058000	2060000	In Japan this year
2060000	2062000	And
2062000	2064000	Over here and in Europe
2064000	2066000	Next year sometime around
2066000	2068000	April 2010
2068000	2070000	It was also reported that
2070000	2072000	3D Realms mentioned that the
2072000	2074000	Delay on Dragon Quest
2074000	2076000	10 also
2076000	2078000	Is going to be delaying Duke Nukem forever
2078000	2080000	Oh gee
2080000	2082000	Even though the games have nothing in common
2082000	2084000	Hey
2084000	2086000	It's very much in common both are going
2086000	2088000	Through delays
2088000	2090000	But there is though a brand new trailer for Final Fantasy 13
2090000	2092000	Out so look for it
2092000	2094000	Another new one or is this the same one
2094000	2096000	That was out a couple weeks ago
2096000	2098000	I think it's the one that's been out for a couple weeks
2098000	2100000	The one that shows some of the battle and CGI
2100000	2102000	Yeah
2102000	2104000	Boy oh boy
2104000	2106000	So Final Fantasy 13 needed another delay
2106000	2108000	The slimes Rob, slimes
2108000	2110000	Well at this point though
2110000	2112000	I'm just kind of used to it
2112000	2114000	Final Fantasy 13 it will be out when it's out
2114000	2116000	I take it back I don't think it's Dragon Quest 9
2116000	2118000	Or Dragon Quest 10
2118000	2120000	It's 9
2120000	2122000	Oh I said 10
2122000	2124000	Never mind
2124000	2126000	Dragon Quest 10 will be delayed until 2012
2126000	2128000	I'm sure 10 is also delayed
2128000	2130000	I'm sure 10 will be out eventually
2130000	2132000	So therefore they can't start working on 10
2132000	2134000	That makes sense to me
2134000	2136000	I bet you anything 10 is on the Wii
2136000	2138000	Or whatever it may be Nintendo's next system
2138000	2140000	Because the last Dragon Quest game that they had on the Wii
2140000	2142000	Was so awesome
2142000	2144000	I'm just saying
2144000	2146000	They'll go for wherever the big market is
2146000	2148000	We'll see
2148000	2150000	Well then the next Dragon Quest game
2150000	2152000	Would be in my pants
2152000	2154000	The biggest market out there
2154000	2156000	Oh shush
2156000	2158000	I don't want to know about that because of slimes
2158000	2160000	Yeah
2160000	2162000	Because Activision
2162000	2164000	Has talked about their
2164000	2166000	2009 lineup
2166000	2168000	It probably will surprise you that there is
2168000	2170000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 coming out this year
2170000	2172000	I know shocking
2172000	2174000	Seeing as that was pretty much
2174000	2176000	Going to come out this year anyways
2176000	2178000	And then apparently
2178000	2180000	There's some sort of
2180000	2182000	Racing game that Bazaar is
2182000	2184000	Working on
2184000	2186000	Some unannounced racing game
2186000	2188000	That's kind of Mario Kart meets Forza
2188000	2190000	Which that'd be kind of cool
2190000	2192000	And then of course
2192000	2194000	Prototypes sometime this year
2194000	2196000	Probably around June
2196000	2198000	And you better believe
2198000	2200000	That there's probably going to be tons of freaking
2200000	2202000	Guitar Hero games
2202000	2204000	Because they already said there's going to be a ton
2204000	2206000	Yeah there probably will be a ton
2206000	2208000	I don't think they're going to renege on that
2208000	2210000	Hmm
2210000	2212000	But only
2212000	2214000	Half the company is going to E3 right?
2214000	2216000	Yes
2216000	2218000	There's no Blizzard in this
2218000	2220000	Activision Blizzard
2220000	2222000	Which doesn't make any sense to me because you can't
2222000	2224000	You're one company you can't have half your company not go
2224000	2226000	No they can get away with it because everybody
2226000	2228000	Knows about Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2
2228000	2230000	Which is we all know what Blizzard will be showing
2230000	2232000	So what the hell
2232000	2234000	Nobody wants to see those
2234000	2236000	Well they know everybody already knows about it
2236000	2238000	Everybody wants to see Guitar Hero greatest hits
2238000	2240000	Or how to run a franchise
2240000	2242000	Into the ground without ever even really trying
2242000	2244000	Well I think the reason why they're probably
2244000	2246000	Not going to be obviously going to E3 is
2246000	2248000	Because then if they show all this stuff off
2248000	2250000	All their big announcements for Blizzcon
2250000	2252000	Will be ruined
2252000	2254000	Because they're going to PAX
2254000	2256000	No they're going to Blizzcon
2256000	2258000	And seriously if they show it at E3 it has to come out
2258000	2260000	You know like Starcraft Ghost
2260000	2262000	I'm
2262000	2264000	I'm looking at some comments from chatroom
2264000	2266000	Tigerclaw says
2266000	2268000	Tigerclaw is talking about the whole Dragon Quest thing
2268000	2270000	Yeah because Dragon Quest made you just in my pants
2270000	2272000	A little reference to the Saturday Night Live sketch
2272000	2274000	Get it?
2274000	2276000	Your album just came out
2276000	2278000	I'm on a boat
2278000	2280000	Can you imagine though if Dragon Quest X really was in Loki's pants
2280000	2282000	A wild schlong approaches
2282000	2284000	A wild schlong approaches
2284000	2286000	A wild schlong approaches
2286000	2288000	A wild schlong approaches
2288000	2290000	Just in my pants
2290000	2292000	Alright
2292000	2294000	I'm selecting run
2294000	2296000	Well something
2296000	2298000	Something that has run away
2298000	2300000	Far far away is the release date
2300000	2302000	Guild Wars 2
2302000	2304000	Sad
2304000	2306000	I know Guild Wars 2 originally was supposed to be out
2306000	2308000	Like in 2008 remember that
2308000	2310000	Like it was supposed to be out in 2008
2310000	2312000	I remember 2008 like it was last year
2312000	2314000	Yes it was
2314000	2316000	And then it got pushed back
2316000	2318000	And now it's been pushed back
2318000	2320000	2010 to 2011
2320000	2322000	Is the new time frame for when Guild Wars 2
2322000	2324000	Is supposed to be out if you can believe it
2324000	2326000	That's a huge release window
2326000	2328000	I'm assuming that sometime in the fiscal year
2328000	2330000	Let's wait until people you know have jobs
2330000	2332000	Or forgot what Guild Wars 2
2332000	2334000	Is about I don't know
2334000	2336000	I got devastated on Kotaku for saying it
2336000	2338000	Doesn't matter
2338000	2340000	Nobody buys Guild Wars
2340000	2342000	The people who play Guild Wars care
2342000	2344000	Nobody new is playing it so
2344000	2346000	It's not wow so nobody cares
2346000	2348000	The people playing Guild Wars
2348000	2350000	Are the people that bought it way back when it came out
2350000	2352000	So they didn't have to pay the monthly fee
2352000	2354000	And they're still playing it after all this time
2354000	2356000	But I think their new subtitle
2356000	2358000	Or not Gears of War
2358000	2360000	Guild Wars 2 will actually
2360000	2362000	Improve you know their
2362000	2364000	Client base
2364000	2366000	Guild Wars 2 now with rampant nudity
2368000	2370000	Ooh naked
2370000	2372000	Big booby adventure
2372000	2374000	Well how about
2374000	2376000	How about something a little bit different
2376000	2378000	I just want to say real quick though the delay
2378000	2380000	Possibly because of the layoffs that NCSoft
2380000	2382000	Has just had and to note
2382000	2384000	They're also skipping E3 this year
2384000	2386000	NCSoft kind of has some issues going on anyway
2386000	2388000	Going out of business
2388000	2390000	Let's hope not because there's a lot of
2390000	2392000	Guild Wars fans will be very upset
2392000	2394000	Just as long as if they go out of business
2394000	2396000	Not a lot of Guild Wars fans
2396000	2398000	The standalone
2398000	2400000	City of Heroes player creator
2400000	2402000	For all the updated outfits
2402000	2404000	And stuff
2404000	2406000	I just want to say though like at PAX
2406000	2408000	I remember we were live one night remember how we did the whole
2408000	2410000	All games thing live at PAX and we were all at the table
2410000	2412000	I'm sorry Rob I don't remember that
2412000	2414000	Going through the memory banks and find it because I remember
2414000	2416000	One night we were sitting at the table
2416000	2418000	And there was a line coming out the door
2418000	2420000	For the panel and one of them
2420000	2422000	Had to do a Guild Wars I remember
2422000	2424000	I distinctly remember it was a Guild Wars panel because I think we were making
2424000	2426000	Fun of Guild Wars a little bit while all the people were in line
2426000	2428000	And getting scow that
2428000	2430000	But of course every panel at PAX had a line
2430000	2432000	Going out the door and around and down the stairs
2432000	2434000	So we had like captive audiences
2434000	2436000	The piracy one was hilarious
2436000	2438000	Anyhow sorry
2438000	2440000	I almost pirated the game during the piracy panel
2440000	2442000	I remember Loki trying to do that
2442000	2444000	He was trying to pirate a game during the piracy panel
2444000	2446000	Just to be ironic
2446000	2448000	You're such an ass Loki
2448000	2450000	So
2450000	2452000	Jackassery
2452000	2454000	So how about
2454000	2456000	People who are Warhammer 40k
2456000	2458000	Fans which is not
2458000	2460000	Me because I get tired
2460000	2462000	Of the stupid little figures
2462000	2464000	I'm sorry I had a bad
2464000	2466000	For our listeners who don't know I had a bad
2466000	2468000	Experience with an ex who was addicted to Warhammer
2468000	2470000	40k and his stupid retarded little
2470000	2472000	Lead figures and having to paint them
2472000	2474000	But I'm not bitter
2474000	2476000	My sister's ex actually is really into Warhammer
2476000	2478000	40k and he does paint the figures
2478000	2480000	And he also
2480000	2482000	Larks and also
2482000	2484000	Plays Vampire the Masquerade
2484000	2486000	I LARPed but then I grew up
2486000	2488000	I just want to point out on wife swap
2488000	2490000	This week it was a LARPer
2490000	2492000	No
2492000	2494000	They swapped with
2494000	2496000	What what
2496000	2498000	They're tasty
2500000	2502000	This explains a lot actually
2504000	2506000	This is why Dan's not allowed to eat
2506000	2508000	Anything that I don't approve of
2508000	2510000	First
2510000	2512000	Anyway
2512000	2514000	So they're working on
2514000	2516000	A beta now for
2516000	2518000	Well actually they had the beta out for
2518000	2520000	Dawn of War 2
2520000	2522000	And that it has
2522000	2524000	Already prompted
2524000	2526000	A big massive
2526000	2528000	Patch lots of changes
2528000	2530000	To go into the game
2530000	2532000	So it is
2532000	2534000	Supposed to be
2534000	2536000	Going through so if any of the
2536000	2538000	Beta players can actually say anything about it
2538000	2540000	And I'm sure there's NDA's and
2540000	2542000	Whatnot about that
2542000	2544000	They need the patch since it comes out what like
2544000	2546000	Next week I mean
2546000	2548000	Seriously
2548000	2550000	Who knows we might be seeing a delay if it's big enough
2550000	2552000	But it was it had to be
2552000	2554000	Enough that you know if they're gonna
2554000	2556000	In fact actually
2556000	2558000	I think this is kind of a fun quote put out
2558000	2560000	By Relic
2560000	2562000	Sometimes we just make mistakes
2562000	2564000	We're only human after all
2564000	2566000	But other times there are very good and well thought out
2566000	2568000	Reasons behind the changes
2568000	2570000	Oh we forgot to put legs on the goblins
2570000	2572000	Now they can't move
2572000	2574000	Shoot naked
2574000	2576000	How about a hug we're only human after all
2576000	2578000	I want them to leave in naked
2578000	2580000	We are the world
2580000	2582000	You know what
2582000	2584000	What
2584000	2586000	It's war hammer just go
2586000	2588000	Play with the lead figures instead
2588000	2590000	And make real friends
2590000	2592000	Eat the lead figures
2592000	2594000	Nice
2594000	2596000	Seriously get out of your house and
2596000	2598000	Eat some lead figures
2598000	2600000	They're not candy
2600000	2602000	I know
2602000	2604000	See that's what they should do war hammer
2604000	2606000	40k gummy figures
2606000	2608000	That way when you destroy their army
2608000	2610000	You can literally bite off their heads
2610000	2612000	Yeah you're just like oh battle damage
2612000	2614000	Why don't you just use goldfish
2614000	2616000	That would actually be a pretty awesome type of role playing game
2616000	2618000	Like I want to come up with a role playing game
2618000	2620000	That's like gummy bear warfare or something
2620000	2622000	You could why not they have fuzzy heroes
2622000	2624000	I mean it would be awesome
2624000	2626000	Fuzzy heroes the game you use with stuffed animals
2626000	2628000	Out of jello wigglers
2628000	2630000	TM
2630000	2632000	Oh my god I like want to create my own
2632000	2634000	Role playing game now that involves me eating
2634000	2636000	It's gotta play like advance wars
2636000	2638000	Figure this out
2638000	2640000	Or totally make it out of chocolate shell and ice cream
2640000	2642000	Or even better a role playing game
2642000	2644000	That's you know comprised of completely
2644000	2646000	With snack food and like you could build
2646000	2648000	Units with different snack foods
2648000	2650000	Dark Tetsuya says OL RPG
2650000	2652000	I'm starting to like this idea
2652000	2654000	Maybe our fantasy
2654000	2656000	Yeah I was gonna say maybe our dream game company
2656000	2658000	Can not just make console games but will make
2658000	2660000	Table top games too
2660000	2662000	And OL RPG will be
2662000	2664000	All based around food
2664000	2666000	Just fat princess with RPG elements
2666000	2668000	Yes I like this idea it's fat princess for real
2668000	2670000	This is a good idea
2670000	2672000	I approve of this thought
2672000	2674000	Apparently there's a new
2674000	2676000	Game coming out that was
2676000	2678000	Revealed during Nintendo
2678000	2680000	Of Japan's fall media conference
2680000	2682000	Of course there
2682000	2684000	Was it wasn't
2684000	2686000	Really a big title it's a game called
2686000	2688000	Kensax and what this is
2688000	2690000	Is actually a first party game
2690000	2692000	That is tied
2692000	2694000	With a search engine
2694000	2696000	Basically you have
2696000	2698000	Different games that are in there
2698000	2700000	That require
2700000	2702000	Looking for you know
2702000	2704000	Making searches on the search engine
2704000	2706000	And based on the amount of hits
2706000	2708000	That you get you get points
2708000	2710000	So for example
2710000	2712000	You know they may have like
2712000	2714000	You know battle search panel 9
2714000	2716000	It says task players
2716000	2718000	Or four players with combining the words
2718000	2720000	From a stock
2720000	2722000	Of words with a 3x3 board
2722000	2724000	And you conduct different search terms
2724000	2726000	And whoever finds the
2726000	2728000	Highest hit count wins
2728000	2730000	And then they have some
2730000	2732000	Finding a certain amount
2732000	2734000	Plus you can also update it I guess
2734000	2736000	It has a library of 3000 words
2736000	2738000	And you can add more to it
2738000	2740000	And then of course you go online
2740000	2742000	To increase
2742000	2744000	The vocabulary plus
2744000	2746000	Update search results
2746000	2748000	I would think if anything had sex or porn
2748000	2750000	In it you're gonna win
2750000	2752000	This game sounds stupid and boring
2752000	2754000	It sounds like something that you do
2754000	2756000	When you're at work
2756000	2758000	And you're on a firewall connection
2758000	2760000	Where they've locked out anything good
2760000	2762000	And all you can do is just find something
2762000	2764000	To amuse yourself
2764000	2766000	That's exactly what this sounds like
2766000	2768000	Dan's got it
2768000	2770000	Yeah I know all about that
2770000	2772000	This is so bad it makes me want to punch myself
2772000	2774000	Right in the face
2774000	2776000	Let's see
2776000	2778000	Punch yourself in the face
2778000	2780000	How many search results do we get from that?
2780000	2782000	A lot
2782000	2784000	The question is
2784000	2786000	How many results down do you have to go
2786000	2788000	Before you actually hit porn?
2788000	2790000	Punch yourself in the face
2790000	2792000	265,000 results
2792000	2794000	Porn? How many results for porn?
2794000	2796000	245 million for porn
2796000	2798000	Porn wins!
2798000	2800000	The internet is for porn
2800000	2802000	How about boobs?
2802000	2804000	Only 60 million for boobs? What's up with that?
2804000	2806000	Anyway, sorry
2806000	2808000	Because one thinks if you've got porn
2808000	2810000	Boobs come with it
2810000	2812000	I mean seriously
2812000	2814000	Where there's porn there's boobs
2814000	2816000	Hey! Where there's Mario and Sonic
2816000	2818000	There's bound to be the Olympics
2818000	2820000	Or something like that
2820000	2822000	Of course Mario and Sonic at the Summer Games
2822000	2824000	Ended up being pretty much a sleeper hit for Sega
2824000	2826000	So it's probably no surprise
2826000	2828000	That Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games
2828000	2830000	Is official
2830000	2832000	And Sega did announce it earlier this week
2832000	2834000	Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic
2834000	2836000	Will once again compete on the Wii S
2836000	2838000	And the DS in Vancouver
2838000	2840000	The Wii S?
2840000	2842000	I said the Wii and the DS, right?
2842000	2844000	You said the Wii S and the DS
2844000	2846000	Works fine
2846000	2848000	The Wii S
2848000	2850000	In Vancouver
2850000	2852000	Is where of course the 2010 Olympic Games
2852000	2854000	Are being held
2854000	2856000	Just in case you want to know how big that first
2856000	2858000	Mario game was, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics
2858000	2860000	The first one, 10 million units globally
2860000	2862000	By the way, the new one
2862000	2864000	The Mario and Sonic at the Winter Games
2864000	2866000	Is going to support the Wii Balance Board
2866000	2868000	Some of the events that will be in it
2868000	2870000	Speed skating, alpine skiing
2870000	2872000	So on and so on, no news about curling
2872000	2874000	But I hope to hell they did not forget curling
2876000	2878000	So there you have it, Mario and Sonic
2878000	2880000	At the Winter Olympics
2880000	2882000	They are making a deck of sporta too
2882000	2884000	Are they really? Yes
2884000	2886000	You need to branch the whole and Sonic out
2886000	2888000	Of the Olympic Games to other mascots
2888000	2890000	Like Master Chief and Sonic
2890000	2892000	At the Olympic Games
2894000	2896000	Game Guru suggests the next game should be
2896000	2898000	Mario and Sonic at the Special Olympics
2898000	2900000	I don't know about that
2900000	2902000	That might be
2902000	2904000	I don't think that got picked up
2904000	2906000	Dan was off mic
2906000	2908000	Dan said it had to be
2908000	2910000	Tails and Toad
2910000	2912000	At the Special Olympics
2912000	2914000	All the characters there
2914000	2916000	But he doesn't care about it anymore
2916000	2918000	Toadette, I can't stand Toadette
2918000	2920000	Toadette definitely is in the Special Olympics
2920000	2922000	Game
2922000	2924000	They need to do an evil one with
2924000	2926000	Waluigi and Shadow
2928000	2930000	He's trying to destroy the Olympics
2932000	2934000	Okay sad trombone
2936000	2938000	Sad trombone
2938000	2940000	Hey release dates, happy trombone
2940000	2942000	Actually can I do a plug? No
2942000	2944000	Of course you can do a plug
2944000	2946000	Just because
2946000	2948000	I am true to my word
2948000	2950000	I would actually like to
2950000	2952000	Plug a
2952000	2954000	Website
2954000	2956000	That my
2956000	2958000	Only teacher this semester
2958000	2960000	Happens to have
2960000	2962000	Because I'm sure that we've
2962000	2964000	Got other designers
2964000	2966000	And people listening to this show
2966000	2968000	So I did want to go ahead and give his website a little
2968000	2970000	Plug
2970000	2972000	If you go to mahalo.com
2972000	2974000	Go look at his fonts
2974000	2976000	They're great
2976000	2978000	Now see

3006000	3008000	Stuff is released on
3008000	3010000	Anyway how about the
3010000	3012000	20th? Because that's really the only
3012000	3014000	Date this week
3014000	3016000	That we've got stuff coming out in the UK
3016000	3018000	We have 50! 50 cent

3042000	3044000	Calendar and camo speedos
3044000	3046000	Necrovision
3046000	3048000	Okay that just sounds kind of gross

3076000	3078000	Oh it was Ryu nevermind

3084000	3086000	Yeah hell yeah
3086000	3088000	Of course Dan will argue with you
3088000	3090000	Until he is red in the face
3090000	3092000	Ken's cooler
3092000	3094000	Just cause he wears red
3094000	3096000	Which is why I said red in the face
3096000	3098000	Not blue in the face
3098000	3100000	But yeah that Warhammer crap comes out too
3100000	3102000	Not a big
3102000	3104000	Warhammer fan are ya?
3104000	3106000	No

3172000	3174000	A virtual lawn but
3174000	3176000	Probably crap
3176000	3178000	And
3178000	3180000	That's pretty much it
3180000	3182000	Busy week in Japan for the Japanese release

3192000	3194000	It's from a company called Triangle Service
3194000	3196000	Right
3196000	3198000	I am not
3198000	3200000	You cannot make this stuff up
3200000	3202000	And it is a shooting game
3202000	3204000	Just so you guys know
3204000	3206000	There's the cover
3206000	3208000	It looks like it's a compilation of other games
3208000	3210000	I'm not sure but
3210000	3212000	It looks like it's those old school type of shooting games
3212000	3214000	That are so popular in Japan
3214000	3216000	Sonic World Adventure as well
3216000	3218000	Star Ocean The Last Hope

3240000	3242000	Coming out in Japan over there as well
3242000	3244000	And naturally they are getting
3244000	3246000	Street Fighter 4 as well
3246000	3248000	From around the world although I believe the Japanese release
3248000	3250000	Just came out for them actually
3250000	3252000	This past week
3252000	3254000	A lot of Japanese stores
3254000	3256000	Are going to be importing the other countries

3324000	3326000	Perfect Sun, Wandering Star
3326000	3328000	And Missing Moon all come out
3328000	3330000	From Namco Bandai on the PSP this week
3330000	3332000	In Japan
3332000	3334000	Remember the good old days when the PSP got games
3334000	3336000	And wasn't just used to emulate old consoles
3336000	3338000	Yeah but Idol Master
3338000	3340000	Is a huge thing in Japan
3340000	3342000	I don't think it caught on over here
3342000	3344000	I don't really know how you would describe Idol Master
3344000	3346000	Never came out over here
3346000	3348000	I was totally looking forward to that new Idol Master game
3348000	3350000	Isn't it like a take on
3350000	3352000	American Idol type thing
3352000	3354000	But it's not actually a singing game
3354000	3356000	You guide your contestants through these games somehow
3356000	3358000	I don't know
3358000	3360000	It's like a sim game
3360000	3362000	There was a game that I used to have on
3362000	3364000	What?
3364000	3366000	I used to talk about something irrelevant
3370000	3372000	Anyway
3372000	3374000	I was actually talking about Dreamcast
3374000	3376000	It was a game called Super Producers
3376000	3378000	That I never got very far in
3378000	3380000	But the way that it was
3380000	3382000	There were different mini games in it
3382000	3384000	That you would manage a pop idol's career
3384000	3386000	I don't think it sold very well
3386000	3388000	Over there though even
3388000	3390000	But it was a weird game
3390000	3392000	I'm telling you, you need to bring back
3392000	3394000	CNC Music Factory
3394000	3396000	Make the video thing
3396000	3398000	Or something
3398000	3400000	Some other type of
3400000	3402000	Make the music video game
3402000	3404000	Dan was talking about a Cliquavision game
3404000	3406000	That was here
3406000	3408000	No
3408000	3410000	I don't recall
3410000	3412000	A manager game
3412000	3414000	Maybe a football manager game
3414000	3416000	I remember those guys
3416000	3418000	I had one of those on the Commodore 64
3418000	3420000	Of course I didn't know what the hell I was doing
3420000	3422000	Anyhow
3422000	3424000	Let's go ahead and move on with some gaming news
3424000	3426000	That's going to do it for release dates
3426000	3428000	Well, Midway
3428000	3430000	Weren't we just singing the joys of Midway
3430000	3432000	Last week
3432000	3434000	I don't know if you'd say the joys
3434000	3436000	Well we were talking about how
3436000	3438000	Midway was the
3438000	3440000	Pretty cool
3440000	3442000	Especially back in the day
3442000	3444000	Their arcade collections will really show you
3444000	3446000	How awesome they are
3446000	3448000	They haven't had a lot lately going for them
3448000	3450000	Even more than that now
3450000	3452000	They have filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy
3452000	3454000	Sad trombone
3458000	3460000	Basically the CEO
3460000	3462000	Matt Booty
3462000	3464000	I'm trying not to laugh
3464000	3466000	Said that it was a difficult but necessary
3466000	3468000	Decision
3468000	3470000	Basically for those who don't know
3470000	3472000	Chapter 11 gives you
3472000	3474000	Relief from your creditors
3474000	3476000	So that you can regroup
3476000	3478000	And get your financial plan back together
3478000	3480000	So
3480000	3482000	Some of those creditors that they
3482000	3484000	Owed money to
3484000	3486000	At the tune of $281 million
3486000	3488000	In liabilities
3488000	3490000	And of course they only have
3490000	3492000	$167 million in assets
3492000	3494000	Wells Fargo Bank
3494000	3496000	They owe $150 million to
3496000	3498000	National Amusements
3498000	3500000	They owe
3500000	3502000	Close to $20 million
3502000	3504000	And apparently they paid for the manufacturing
3504000	3506000	Costs during the
3506000	3508000	For Midway's Holiday lineup
3508000	3510000	NBA Properties Inc
3510000	3514000	Almost $17.3 million
3514000	3516000	In licensing and royalty fees
3516000	3518000	Warner Brothers Interactive
3518000	3520000	$6.6 million
3520000	3522000	And Epic Games
3522000	3526000	$1.975 million
3526000	3528000	For licensing and royalty fees
3528000	3530000	Probably for Unreal Tournament
3530000	3532000	Kind of interesting
3532000	3534000	That they are
3534000	3536000	Doing so horribly
3536000	3538000	I also read another story
3538000	3540000	That apparently somebody had purchased
3540000	3542000	Controlling shares of Midway
3542000	3544000	For only $100,000
3544000	3546000	So some dude out there
3546000	3548000	Owns like 80% of the company
3548000	3550000	Now with $100,000
3550000	3552000	The mystery investor
3552000	3554000	Yes
3554000	3556000	They inherited like
3556000	3558000	Millions and millions of dollars in debt
3558000	3560000	And basically paid
3560000	3562000	Virtually nothing for
3562000	3564000	Tons of the rights
3564000	3566000	But yeah it's like the mystery investor
3566000	3568000	Well supposedly he's supposed to be protected from the debts
3568000	3570000	But he's still gonna make more than
3570000	3572000	$100,000 on the deal
3572000	3574000	Oh yeah cause he's gonna get all the rights
3574000	3576000	Then he's gonna make
3576000	3578000	Mortal Kombat out of his basement
3578000	3580000	Mortal Kombat
3580000	3582000	Versus like the Care Bears or something
3582000	3584000	Mortal Kombat versus your mom
3584000	3586000	Nice
3586000	3588000	This doesn't mean though
3588000	3590000	That Midway is like shutting its doors
3590000	3592000	Or anything it just means
3592000	3594000	But it's not a good sign
3594000	3596000	They might as well
3596000	3598000	Just sell Mortal Kombat to somebody else
3598000	3600000	Really other than like
3600000	3602000	Mortal Kombat there hasn't been a lot that they've put out lately
3602000	3604000	That's been any good
3604000	3606000	That's not the purpose though of Chapter 11
3606000	3608000	Chapter 11
3608000	3610000	Is meant for a company
3610000	3612000	That they see recovery in their future
3612000	3614000	This just gives them
3614000	3616000	Momentary relief
3616000	3618000	Well I have to say though what I think of
3618000	3620000	When I think of Chapter 11 in this day and age
3620000	3622000	Is like remember what happened with Mervins
3622000	3624000	The big clothing store chain here in California
3624000	3626000	Mervins filed for Chapter 11 and not even a week later
3626000	3628000	They were gone
3628000	3630000	Like the liquidators were coming into town
3630000	3632000	So you have to worry a little bit
3632000	3634000	It's still a preemptive step
3634000	3636000	I mean look at a claim
3636000	3638000	Chapter 11 bankruptcy basically
3638000	3640000	Gives a company a chance to come to terms
3640000	3642000	With its creditors
3642000	3644000	And if the financing is not out there
3644000	3646000	They're hosed
3646000	3648000	Circuit City closed down after being in Chapter 11
3648000	3650000	I mean if you go back to
3650000	3652000	The 80's
3652000	3654000	This is 80's style
3654000	3656000	Worlds of Wonder who made Teddy Ruxpin and laser tech
3656000	3658000	Yeah
3658000	3660000	They were in Chapter 11 for years
3660000	3662000	Because they had strong properties
3662000	3664000	And people were always like
3664000	3666000	Man we got to extend these guys some credit
3666000	3668000	Because they're going to pull it up
3668000	3670000	No they just kept nose diving like 1991
3670000	3672000	And if only they had combined
3672000	3674000	Teddy Ruxpin and laser tech together
3674000	3676000	They would have been an unstoppable force
3676000	3678000	I bet you they did
3678000	3680000	I bet you that somewhere
3680000	3682000	At Worlds of Wonder there was a laser tech
3682000	3684000	That you could like shoot at Teddy Ruxpin
3684000	3686000	And he'd be like stop stop
3686000	3688000	Aren't you my friend
3688000	3690000	Were they the ones that made my buddy
3690000	3692000	My buddy
3692000	3694000	No that was Galoob
3694000	3696000	What happened to Galoob are they
3696000	3698000	Micro machines
3698000	3700000	Galoob I think got bought up by Hasbro
3700000	3702000	Or Mattel or somebody significant
3702000	3704000	Yeah I think because they're still
3704000	3706000	Making micro machines and those are Galoob
3706000	3708000	As well if I remember right
3708000	3710000	I actually think micro machines are now put out under the Hasbro
3710000	3712000	Label I think
3712000	3714000	No they probably bought it up
3714000	3716000	So
3716000	3718000	If it doesn't say micro machines
3718000	3720000	It's not the real thing
3720000	3722000	What ever happened to that guy that talks really fast
3722000	3724000	Is he still alive
3724000	3726000	No he's alive
3726000	3728000	I'm confused with the guy who is the scat man
3728000	3730000	That guy died
3730000	3732000	John Machito isn't that his name
3732000	3734000	I get them mixed up they not only look similar
3734000	3736000	But you know
3736000	3738000	The scat man guy looks like
3738000	3740000	The micro machines guy
3740000	3742000	Oh I see you mean the one from the video
3742000	3744000	That one
3744000	3746000	Scat man carter
3746000	3748000	He's like massively dead
3748000	3750000	Am I crazy surely people remember the scat man song
3750000	3752000	John Machito is still alive
3752000	3754000	Alright good
3754000	3756000	Thank you Stufra
3756000	3758000	Speaking of companies
3758000	3760000	And all this crazy bankruptcy
3760000	3762000	And whatever is going on
3762000	3764000	This isn't bankruptcy but it's an acquisition
3764000	3766000	Apparently Namco Bandai is looking to
3766000	3768000	Acquire D3
3768000	3770000	They're going to buy all of D3 stock
3770000	3772000	Apparently
3772000	3774000	Namco has already apparently made some deals
3774000	3776000	With the board over at D3
3776000	3778000	They're going to have a 70% stake in the company
3778000	3780000	I guess they already have it
3780000	3782000	They're going to purchase the remaining 30%
3782000	3784000	At about $680 a share
3784000	3786000	They're going to have controlling interest
3786000	3788000	In the Naruto property
3788000	3790000	Doesn't D3 also make
3790000	3792000	Onichibara
3792000	3794000	Yeah they do a lot of the ports of the simple series games
3794000	3796000	Which really I don't know who the
3796000	3798000	Japanese companies are that make these
3798000	3800000	But they need to pump out more of them
3800000	3802000	I want to see zombies vs ambulances over here
3802000	3804000	Remember when Namco was great
3804000	3806000	Now they're just watering it down
3806000	3808000	First they poured in a big bucket
3808000	3810000	Of Namco or Bandai
3810000	3812000	And I mean
3812000	3814000	I know Bandai is huge in Japan
3814000	3816000	And they make toys and everything but they make crappy ass games
3816000	3818000	And Namco made awesome games
3818000	3820000	And now Namco Bandai makes kind of crappy games
3820000	3822000	And now you're just going to pour another company in there
3822000	3824000	And it's funny you bring that up
3824000	3826000	Because they're actually saying that
3826000	3828000	D3 could benefit from
3828000	3830000	Especially the Bandai arm, they make the toys
3830000	3832000	TV, arcade
3832000	3834000	They make all this other stuff, movies and stuff
3834000	3836000	That could actually
3836000	3838000	Maybe help D3
3838000	3840000	Maybe we could get, I don't know, Oni Chambara
3840000	3842000	The TV show, that would be kind of awesome actually
3842000	3844000	Bring the movie over
3844000	3846000	Maybe we could get some Bikini Samurais and Tekken
3846000	3848000	There you go
3848000	3850000	That'd be kind of cool
3850000	3852000	That'd be very cool
3852000	3854000	But anyway look for that to happen very soon
3854000	3856000	Why can't we have another Klonoa?
3856000	3858000	Aren't they bringing the Klonoa remake to Wii or something?
3858000	3860000	Yeah it's coming out
3860000	3862000	We need a new Klonoa
3862000	3864000	Next few months, May I think
3864000	3866000	Klonoa is awesome
3866000	3868000	More acquisition news
3868000	3870000	You know
3870000	3872000	Squeenix
3872000	3874000	Is trying to make a purchase
3874000	3876000	And Squeenix
3876000	3878000	Has done a lot of things
3878000	3880000	That have made us go
3880000	3882000	What? Over
3882000	3884000	But they are trying to purchase
3884000	3886000	Eidos
3886000	3888000	And they're trying to
3888000	3890000	Basically buy it
3890000	3892000	More than it's worth using
3892000	3894000	129%
3894000	3896000	Over their current market value
3896000	3898000	So
3898000	3900000	We're looking at
3900000	3902000	Grabby grabby Squeenix
3902000	3904000	We're looking at
3904000	3906000	80's style takeover
3908000	3910000	So
3910000	3912000	If they want it, they're gonna get it
3912000	3914000	You know what Squeenix does
3914000	3916000	It's ours
3916000	3918000	However
3918000	3920000	I do have to say
3920000	3922000	That Kotaku is my hero
3922000	3924000	For using a picture of dead Eris
3924000	3926000	To advertise this
3926000	3928000	So
3928000	3930000	That makes me quite happy
3932000	3934000	Kind of an interesting merger
3934000	3936000	If you think about it
3936000	3938000	With the whole
3938000	3940000	Tomb Raider series
3940000	3942000	Going
3942000	3944000	You know
3944000	3946000	What else does Eidos have over there?
3946000	3948000	I can't remember some of the other big stuff they publish
3948000	3950000	Hitman
3950000	3952000	They have Just Cause coming out
3952000	3954000	At some point
3954000	3956000	Well Just Cause 2 at least
3956000	3958000	Interesting because those are the
3958000	3960000	Types of games Squeenix never really seems
3960000	3962000	To get involved with so that would be a very interesting
3962000	3964000	Sort of merger especially if Squeenix is really wanting
3964000	3966000	To get into the western development or whatever
3966000	3968000	You know
3968000	3970000	You guys are killing me with this Squeenix thing by the way
3970000	3972000	It's Squeenix
3972000	3974000	We like to call it Squeenix
3974000	3976000	The god damn company is called Enix
3976000	3978000	It's Squeenix
3978000	3980000	Actually it's Square Enix
3980000	3982000	It's the whole thing
3982000	3984000	They don't abbreviate it at all
3984000	3986000	But we say Squeenix
3986000	3988000	Squeenix is terrible
3988000	3990000	That's the most bizarre merger
3990000	3992000	You wonder why Square Enix would even bother
3992000	3994000	You know
3994000	3996000	Any decent franchises that Eidos had
3996000	3998000	Any good development studios that they had
3998000	4000000	They're pretty much flushed
4000000	4002000	I mean
4002000	4004000	I guess you might get a
4004000	4006000	Kane and Lynch, woo!
4006000	4008000	Kane and Lynch, yeah!
4008000	4010000	Battle Stations
4010000	4012000	I think that series
4012000	4014000	So the Battle Stations Pacific or something
4014000	4016000	Is coming out
4016000	4018000	Yeah, it's nothing that's really exciting
4018000	4020000	You know, Tomb Raider is kind of what they have
4020000	4022000	And like I said
4022000	4024000	Maybe Hitman
4024000	4026000	Although you gotta wonder about the viability of the Hitman
4026000	4028000	Franchise because they didn't even bring out a game to go with
4028000	4030000	It's really crappy movie
4030000	4032000	You know, what are you
4032000	4034000	Gonna do with that company?
4034000	4036000	Tomb Raider RPG?
4036000	4038000	You know, I don't know
4038000	4040000	Maybe it would save the franchise a little bit
4040000	4042000	AlphaKananagram in chat suggests
4042000	4044000	It's called Square Anus
4044000	4046000	Is actually what the chat
4046000	4048000	Actually it's
4048000	4050000	Don't even guess on NX, because NX is an awesome company
4050000	4052000	And Square used to be great too
4052000	4054000	It's the bizarre combination of them that just
4054000	4056000	Has fallen into RPG hell
4056000	4058000	Remember when Square made Einhonder?
4058000	4060000	Remember when NX made fucking Actraiser?
4060000	4062000	Yeah, and NX made Actraiser
4062000	4064000	And Illusion of Gaia
4064000	4066000	And that whole series
4066000	4068000	Secret of Mana
4068000	4070000	Bust a Move
4070000	4072000	Dude, NX made Bust a Move
4072000	4074000	Those companies just made
4074000	4076000	Great games, now it's just
4076000	4078000	Rehash for old RPGs
4078000	4080000	Bring out new crappy JRPGs
4080000	4082000	You know, what? Come on
4082000	4084000	This is what I demand out of Square Enix for
4084000	4086000	Penance, is a new Bust a Move game
4086000	4088000	That's what I want
4088000	4090000	None of this Dance Summit 2001 crap
4090000	4092000	No, Burn in Hell
4092000	4094000	It's got to have Hero-kun
4094000	4096000	And it's got to have Heat and Sprite
4096000	4098000	I want a reboot of the Bust a Move series
4098000	4100000	It's got to be completely uncensored when they bring it to America
4100000	4102000	So people are smoking and drinking and shooting each other
4102000	4104000	And then they dance their way out of it
4104000	4106000	That game was awesome
4106000	4108000	That game was beyond awesome
4108000	4110000	I love the fact that one of the attacks was that Strike was shooting you
4110000	4112000	In fact, I just gave you
4112000	4114000	We should put it right now
4114000	4116000	Squenix, I gave you the new tagline
4116000	4118000	Bust a Move 3, Beyond Awesome
4118000	4120000	Bust a Move
4120000	4122000	Dance or Bust a Cap on your end
4122000	4124000	Bust a Cap
4124000	4126000	You got served
4126000	4128000	Rama says God dammit Square Enix
4128000	4130000	I want Rad Racer 3
4130000	4132000	Yeah, Rad Racer rules
4132000	4134000	Only if it has
4134000	4136000	3D when you hit the select button
4136000	4138000	Yeah, and you've got to be able to change the tracks
4138000	4140000	And the Nintendo music has to be there
4140000	4142000	Which in this day and age, it might actually be
4142000	4144000	Kind of doable with this whole stuff they're talking about
4144000	4146000	3D, can you imagine
4146000	4148000	Remember when they were talking about that the Wii's top secret thing
4148000	4150000	Was going to be 3D projection
4150000	4152000	In your room and all this fucking bullshit
4152000	4154000	Why did we ever believe that fucking shit
4154000	4156000	Because that would be super awesome
4156000	4158000	And really innovative
4158000	4160000	And then they're like, no, we don't want to do that
4160000	4162000	People love to give Nintendo
4162000	4164000	Way more credit than they deserve
4164000	4166000	Anyhow, forget it
4166000	4168000	Let's uh
4168000	4170000	Let's get into some other stories
4170000	4172000	Sorry
4172000	4174000	Because remember it's only good for Nintendo
4174000	4176000	To innovate unless it will benefit their
4176000	4178000	Casual audience
4178000	4180000	That's what it really comes down to
4180000	4182000	Yes, indeed
4182000	4184000	So if you're a casual
4184000	4186000	Game purchaser
4186000	4188000	Perhaps you're looking for a rental
4188000	4190000	Solution, in which case
4190000	4192000	You know, of course there's Gamefly
4192000	4194000	Out there for you, but if you don't want to do
4194000	4196000	Gamefly, maybe Blockbuster Total
4196000	4198000	Access. They actually
4198000	4200000	Had Total Access for a while now with
4200000	4202000	Movies, but now they've incorporated games
4202000	4204000	Into their subscription plan
4204000	4206000	And basically it will work
4206000	4208000	Kind of similar to
4208000	4210000	You know, how it does with movies
4210000	4212000	Except it'll cost a little bit more if you rent a game
4212000	4214000	I think it's like, it upsets five
4214000	4216000	Additional dollars
4216000	4218000	The plans are $19.99 a month
4218000	4220000	You know, for the movie side and of course
4220000	4222000	$5 if a game is
4222000	4224000	Rented as well
4224000	4226000	And then what's kind of different with
4226000	4228000	The Total Access plan versus
4228000	4230000	Gamefly, is Gamefly
4230000	4232000	You can only mail your stuff back
4232000	4234000	With Total Access you can actually take it into a store
4234000	4236000	And swap it in a store
4236000	4238000	So you can do it in the store or over the mail
4238000	4240000	So, that's kind of neat
4240000	4242000	I'm thinking about switching to the Blockbuster thing
4242000	4244000	Only because they have this whole in the store thing
4244000	4246000	That you can do, and sometimes I don't want to wait for
4246000	4248000	Netflix, you know
4248000	4250000	Well, in the store is not a bad thing
4250000	4252000	Especially with Gamefly and stuff
4252000	4254000	It's a good program to get stuff mailed to you
4254000	4256000	But sometimes you want the instant gratification
4256000	4258000	Where you can just go to the store
4258000	4260000	Okay, I want to rent that game, done
4260000	4262000	But I don't want to lose instant Netflix
4262000	4264000	Like, I also like instant Netflix
4264000	4266000	That would be ultimate
4266000	4268000	But the Netflix streaming is awesome
4268000	4270000	There is a rumor though
4270000	4272000	That they're going to somehow incorporate this
4272000	4274000	Into the Playstation Network
4274000	4276000	Oh, please let this be true
4276000	4278000	So, I don't know if that's actually going to happen or not
4278000	4280000	But it's rumored that
4280000	4282000	Maybe they're thinking about it
4282000	4284000	Sony can't do anything that cool anymore
4284000	4286000	So, don't bet on it
4286000	4288000	Sony will find a way to screw it up
4288000	4290000	I wish they would prove you wrong on that
4290000	4292000	It would be great though if you were walking around at home
4292000	4294000	And you could walk up to your TV and turn it on
4294000	4296000	And like, you know, your total access menu
4296000	4298000	Would come up and you had streaming
4298000	4300000	Or I could just bypass that home bullshit
4300000	4302000	Just hit a button
4302000	4304000	You could make your dude sit down and watch it
4304000	4306000	And look bored, I think that would be awesome
4306000	4308000	And then smoke a bowl
4308000	4310000	That's what I think
4310000	4312000	Watching Cheech and Chung on Blockbuster
4312000	4314000	So, it would be really interesting
4314000	4316000	If they had, you know
4316000	4318000	Context sensitive reactions
4318000	4320000	So, if they watch a sad movie
4320000	4322000	They'll sit there and cry
4322000	4324000	If they watch Cheech and Chung, they'll sit there and neck toke
4324000	4326000	Which would be hilarious
4326000	4328000	Not likely, but hilarious
4328000	4330000	But I just think that would be pretty cool
4330000	4332000	Yeah, somehow I don't think that would get by
4332000	4334000	Like the Sony sensors or what have you
4334000	4336000	Well, I don't think the smoking dope thing would happen
4336000	4338000	But I think that, you know, having your little dude watch TV
4338000	4340000	I mean, come on
4340000	4342000	A bajillion freaking people play The Sims
4342000	4344000	So, you know, and they watch
4344000	4346000	Their Sims do nothing
4346000	4348000	I don't want that home bullshit
4348000	4350000	Then don't use it, you don't have to
4350000	4352000	I'm saying it would be cool if it was there
4352000	4354000	God damn it, you're missing the point
4354000	4356000	Just so I could see it that one time and go
4356000	4358000	Wow, that's fucking cool, okay, I'm done
4358000	4360000	There you go
4360000	4362000	It's like a stream saver for your life
4362000	4364000	It's called how many millions of dollars does Sony have to spend
4364000	4366000	To get me to say, wow, that's fucking cool, next
4366000	4368000	Well, if it makes someone say
4368000	4370000	Wow, that's fucking cool enough for me to buy a PS3
4370000	4372000	I mean, come on
4372000	4374000	How many systems has Nintendo sold with the controller
4374000	4376000	For the Wii
4376000	4378000	People are like, ooh, I can wave my hand
4378000	4380000	This is great, oh wow, it really sucks
4380000	4382000	For actual gameplay
4382000	4384000	That's really sad
4384000	4386000	I don't know
4386000	4388000	I don't know what to tell you
4388000	4390000	But yeah
4390000	4392000	You can look for that blockbuster
4392000	4394000	Thing coming soon, I guess
4394000	4396000	Or is that now, that you can do the game thing now
4396000	4398000	I think it's very soon
4398000	4400000	If not now
4400000	4402000	I kind of want to do that, but I still want Netflix too
4402000	4404000	For streaming
4404000	4406000	Just quandary
4406000	4408000	I don't want both, it's too much money
4408000	4410000	Or just, I don't know, go rent a movie
4410000	4412000	Here's the other thing
4412000	4414000	If you change your address
4414000	4416000	Hollywood Video will send you a bunch of these
4416000	4418000	Welcome to the neighborhood
4418000	4420000	Free game or free movie
4420000	4422000	My sister has moved apartments
4422000	4424000	In her complex a few times
4424000	4426000	She's got a ton of those things
4426000	4428000	She keeps bouncing from different Hollywood videos
4428000	4430000	Because they'll let her do it over and over
4430000	4432000	Or if she doesn't rent anything
4432000	4434000	From a Hollywood video for a while
4434000	4436000	They'll eventually call her and say, hey, do you want free rental
4436000	4438000	Come back in the store type thing
4438000	4440000	So she bounces between three different Hollywood videos
4440000	4442000	And they keep sending her those
4442000	4444000	That sounds like entirely too much effort
4444000	4446000	To save the five, six bucks
4446000	4448000	She's poor, so yeah
4448000	4450000	She's poor
4450000	4452000	Entertainment? However I could get it
4452000	4454000	Alright
4454000	4456000	Hey the DS Lite Onyx version
4456000	4458000	That would be the black one for most of us
4458000	4460000	Call it the Black DS Lite
4460000	4462000	Apparently, shut up, apparently
4462000	4464000	It has been discontinued
4464000	4466000	At least
4466000	4468000	That is the rumor
4468000	4470000	Going on
4470000	4472000	And Loki is confirming
4472000	4474000	It's happened
4474000	4476000	Nintendo is discontinuing the Onyx DS Lite
4476000	4478000	I have a rare system then
4478000	4480000	Black DS Lite
4480000	4482000	Is coming out the door
4482000	4484000	The only four colors left
4484000	4486000	Metallic Silver, Metallic Rose
4486000	4488000	Black in Cobalt Blue
4488000	4490000	And Black in Crimson Red
4490000	4492000	Pink, Pinker, Pinkest, and Very Pink
4492000	4494000	Are the four colors that are left
4494000	4496000	Of the DS
4500000	4502000	Is this because
4502000	4504000	This is kind of the thought process
4504000	4506000	Going around
4506000	4508000	That a DSi is coming relatively soonish
4508000	4510000	And that the DSi is going to be black
4510000	4512000	They did the same thing
4512000	4514000	With the White DS
4514000	4516000	After a while they just want to stop
4516000	4518000	Making
4518000	4520000	A certain color
4520000	4522000	I don't know
4522000	4524000	Because five colors is too many
4524000	4526000	But four is just right I guess
4526000	4528000	I guess
4528000	4530000	Anyhow, let's get into
4530000	4532000	A segment of the show we like to do every week
4532000	4534000	Here at Orange Lounge Radio
4534000	4536000	It's a moment for us to respect the classics
4536000	4538000	We need to pay tribute to those games
4538000	4540000	That came before the ones we're talking about this week
4540000	4542000	It's a little segment we call
4542000	4544000	Dark Sakura's Classic Video Game of the Week
4546000	4548000	Dark Sakura has dug through
4548000	4550000	The Classic Game Archive, I'm assuming with Dan's
4550000	4552000	Help a little bit this week, and has picked
4552000	4554000	One game to highlight
4554000	4556000	For you folks on the show tonight
4556000	4558000	What game have you picked?
4558000	4560000	Today's game is The Revenge of Shinobi
4560000	4562000	And Dan did inspire me to pick it
4562000	4564000	We had
4564000	4566000	A little bit of a conversation last night
4566000	4568000	About copyrighted characters
4568000	4570000	Making their way into
4570000	4572000	Different releases of this game
4572000	4574000	So I thought it would be worth mentioning
4576000	4578000	Plus it does have some pretty cool music
4580000	4582000	As I was about to say
4582000	4584000	This soundtrack is
4584000	4586000	By Yuzo Koshiro
4586000	4588000	And
4588000	4590000	It's actually
4590000	4592000	You can also find it in the Mega Games 2
4592000	4594000	Mega Drive 6-Pack, Sega Classics
4594000	4596000	Arcade Collection for Sega CD
4596000	4598000	And the Sega Smash Pack for PC and Dreamcast
4602000	4604000	But not on Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Book
4606000	4608000	Also the
4608000	4610000	Is saying that the introductory game screen
4610000	4612000	Has
4612000	4614000	Sonny Chiba
4614000	4616000	As Hattori Hanzo
4616000	4618000	From the Kage no Gungan series
4618000	4620000	So that's pretty cool
4620000	4622000	Anyway
4622000	4624000	It is a side schooling platform
4624000	4626000	Game
4626000	4628000	You control Joe Musashi
4628000	4630000	And go through 8th districts
4630000	4632000	And you actually have to
4632000	4634000	Defeat the head of Mio Zeed
4634000	4636000	There's three scenes in each level
4636000	4638000	With their own boss characters
4638000	4640000	And you use the D-Pad, A, B, and C buttons
4640000	4642000	To do your
4642000	4644000	Ninjutsu attack
4644000	4646000	Your regular attack, and your jump
4646000	4648000	And you also have a somersault
4648000	4650000	Move
4650000	4652000	That you can press the jump button
4652000	4654000	And then press it again
4654000	4656000	At the height of your jump
4656000	4658000	So that you can jump more
4658000	4660000	And throw eight shuriken in the air
4660000	4662000	At the same time
4662000	4664000	So
4664000	4666000	You can actually go
4666000	4668000	Over different layers
4668000	4670000	In the area
4670000	4672000	Like you can be in the foreground
4672000	4674000	In the background, indoor, outdoor
4674000	4676000	Or on the highway
4676000	4678000	You have
4678000	4680000	You have different
4680000	4682000	Ninjutsu techniques
4682000	4684000	You've got
4684000	4686000	Ninjutsu no
4686000	4688000	Ikazuchi
4688000	4690000	Karyu, Fushin, and Mijin
4690000	4692000	And respectively
4692000	4694000	The first one is lightning
4694000	4696000	The second one is flame
4696000	4698000	The third one is more jumping
4698000	4700000	And the last one is explosions
4700000	4702000	It actually costs you one life
4702000	4704000	But
4704000	4706000	If you don't have a life
4706000	4708000	Then you can't do it
4708000	4710000	You also have bonus crates
4710000	4712000	That have stuff hidden in them
4712000	4714000	So you can just go beat up stuff
4714000	4716000	It has easy, normal, hard, and hardest
4716000	4718000	Just meaning more enemies
4718000	4720000	And a shorter life bar
4720000	4722000	The Japanese version called
4722000	4724000	The Super Shinobi
4724000	4726000	There are options
4726000	4728000	For no death
4728000	4730000	And level select
4730000	4732000	So
4732000	4734000	The different stages
4734000	4736000	Is Ibaraki
4736000	4738000	The province of Japan, Tokyo
4738000	4740000	The military base, Detroit
4740000	4742000	Area code 818
4742000	4744000	Chinatown
4744000	4746000	New York, and Neo-Z Marine
4746000	4748000	Stronghold
4748000	4750000	So now we come to the different versions
4750000	4752000	As I was mentioning, there are different copyrighted characters
4752000	4754000	In the different versions
4754000	4756000	And I think you had one
4756000	4758000	Don't we have one?
4758000	4760000	This game, just so everyone knows
4760000	4762000	Was fucking awesome
4762000	4764000	It was the reason to buy a Genesis
4764000	4766000	Back in the day
4766000	4768000	And one of the things that was so great about it
4768000	4770000	Besides the fact that it's got
4770000	4772000	Brutal, unforgiving difficulty
4772000	4774000	If you don't push it out and play on easy
4774000	4776000	Is that as you play through the game
4776000	4778000	You ran into
4778000	4780000	Like, classic movies
4780000	4782000	There was a boss
4782000	4784000	Who was Spider-Man
4784000	4786000	And he stayed as Spider-Man
4786000	4788000	Sega had a Spider-Man license
4788000	4790000	He would crawl on Spider-Man for a while
4790000	4792000	He would crawl off the screen
4792000	4794000	And he would come back and it was Batman
4794000	4796000	And I mean, if it wasn't
4796000	4798000	You know, it wasn't a licensed Batman
4798000	4800000	But it would just like Batman
4800000	4802000	And in one of the subsequent re-releases
4802000	4804000	Of the same cartridge
4804000	4806000	It was the same game
4806000	4808000	They replaced him with, you know, a Batman
4808000	4810000	Not Batman
4810000	4812000	One of the enemies looked like Rambo
4812000	4814000	They took off his hair
4814000	4816000	So he didn't look like Rambo anymore
4816000	4818000	And there's a guy
4818000	4820000	Who looks like, there's a Terminator
4820000	4822000	I mean, he looks like Schwarzenegger
4822000	4824000	When you hit him, his skin starts coming off
4824000	4826000	And he's a cyborg underneath
4826000	4828000	And he blows up Terminator style
4828000	4830000	And finally, there's Godzilla
4830000	4832000	And it's, you know, Godzilla
4832000	4834000	You know, towering
4834000	4836000	And breathing fire
4836000	4838000	And they replaced him with a
4838000	4840000	Like a weird skeleton
4840000	4842000	Not Mechagodzilla
4842000	4844000	Which would have been even cooler
4844000	4846000	That might be part of the reason why it missed out
4846000	4848000	On the Mega Genesis collection thing that just came out
4848000	4850000	Is that maybe these strange licensed
4850000	4852000	Bosses kept it out of the collection
4852000	4854000	Well, it's strange enough
4854000	4856000	Because Revenge of Shinobi
4856000	4858000	If you heard it, it's been on like six collections
4858000	4860000	It was on all the ones through the Dreamcast
4860000	4862000	It was on
4862000	4864000	PC collections
4864000	4866000	I mean, I'm sure that that's one of the things
4866000	4868000	That knocked it down, probably honestly
4868000	4870000	The Spider-Man license
4870000	4872000	Because even in the
4872000	4874000	The Shinobi for the
4874000	4876000	For the
4876000	4878000	Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection
4878000	4880000	They recolored the quote-unquote
4880000	4882000	Spider-Man enemies from
4882000	4884000	Red and blue to yellow and blue
4884000	4886000	So, you know, probably a little bit of
4886000	4888000	You know, hey, don't want to get sued by
4888000	4890000	Marvel this time around
4890000	4892000	But I'm sure that that's what it is
4892000	4894000	But the real pity of that is
4894000	4896000	Is this would have been just an awesome
4896000	4898000	Chance, you know, to
4898000	4900000	To have the Shinobi
4900000	4902000	One, two, and three
4902000	4904000	All at hand
4904000	4906000	Yeah, that is the one bummer because with so many
4906000	4908000	Complete Sega
4908000	4910000	Franchises there, it's kind of a bummer to have this
4910000	4912000	One missing, but did you notice there's one other
4912000	4914000	Big franchise that's missing, Strider
4914000	4916000	Was missing
4916000	4918000	Oh, it's Capcom, oh, that's right, it's not Sega
4918000	4920000	I thought Sega did it
4920000	4922000	I've been thinking about this
4922000	4924000	And this is something that I can kind of go off about
4924000	4926000	Because on Ultimate Genesis
4926000	4928000	Collection, I mean, it's far from the
4928000	4930000	Ultimate Genesis Collection
4930000	4932000	It's a great, great collection
4932000	4934000	But it's got some clunkers that they could have
4934000	4936000	Replaced with way better Sega games
4936000	4938000	And I'm sure that that's being saved for Sonic's
4938000	4940000	Even more Ultimate Genesis Collection, too
4940000	4942000	But, I mean, there was no Shadow Dancer
4942000	4944000	The Secret of Shinobi
4944000	4946000	You know, you could have had
4946000	4948000	More arcade unlockables, like
4948000	4950000	You had, you know, if you played Shinobi 3
4950000	4952000	You unlocked Shinobi 1, which was great
4952000	4954000	I was so happy, but wouldn't it have been really cool
4954000	4956000	To have been able to play Shadow Dancer
4956000	4958000	The arcade version of Shadow Dancer
4958000	4960000	Wouldn't it have been great to have been able to
4960000	4962000	Have unlocked, you know, maybe
4962000	4964000	Had Outrun on there
4964000	4966000	Oh yeah, that was missing, huh
4966000	4968000	You know, just Thunder Blade
4968000	4970000	You know, they had Super Thunder Blade
4970000	4972000	But not the way better arcade Thunder Blade
4972000	4974000	After Burner, I mean, there were
4974000	4976000	So many significant, I mean, that thing could have had
4976000	4978000	30 more games
4978000	4980000	And then arcade versions of those same games
4980000	4982000	And it just would have been just fantastic
4982000	4984000	But I guess you can't expect Sega
4984000	4986000	Company for 30 bucks, I expected
4986000	4988000	Though, so they should have done it
4988000	4990000	But yeah, it would have been really cool to have
4990000	4992000	Just had the whole Shinobi franchise
4992000	4994000	In one place, you know, had the lock on
4994000	4996000	Technology with the Sonic and that, but
4996000	4998000	You know, back to Revenge of Shinobi
4998000	5000000	It's awesome, if you have a Sega Genesis
5000000	5002000	Kicking around, it's a super common
5002000	5004000	Cartridge, you might get lucky
5004000	5006000	Find that you have one of the early release cartridges
5006000	5008000	With all the, all the bosses
5008000	5010000	Even the one I had back in the day, had the Rambo
5010000	5012000	Guys edited, the one I have now
5012000	5014000	Actually does have the Rambo Guys
5014000	5016000	So I was pretty stoked when I was playing it
5016000	5020000	Super, super awesome game
5020000	5022000	Really hard
5022000	5024000	There's more changes actually
5024000	5026000	They also did
5026000	5028000	For a release
5028000	5030000	1.02
5030000	5032000	Which was the last release
5032000	5034000	They also did put up an
5034000	5036000	Acknowledgement of the Spider-Man copyright
5036000	5038000	And there was only
5038000	5040000	One ending you had to
5040000	5042000	Save now, go to win the game
5042000	5044000	Yeah, the way that you get the ending in that game
5044000	5046000	Is totally cool
5046000	5048000	You get into the final level
5048000	5050000	And I think, I mean I'm sure a lot of people
5050000	5052000	Have done it, because again, when you play, when you talk to people online
5052000	5054000	You always find out that the game you thought you were a
5054000	5056000	Bato at, people are better
5056000	5058000	But to get the final ending
5058000	5060000	You had to fight the boss
5060000	5062000	While your girl ran around in the background
5062000	5064000	And a giant cement block
5064000	5066000	Lowered towards her
5066000	5068000	And if you couldn't beat the boss fast enough
5068000	5070000	She got smooshed
5070000	5072000	And you got a cool, solitary, ninja-like ending
5072000	5074000	And if you won
5074000	5076000	You know, you're standing there on the edge of the cliff
5076000	5078000	With your girlfriend, it looks like something out of Castlevania
5078000	5080000	But you have a girl with you
5080000	5082000	And it's awesome, so
5082000	5084000	You have to have some techniques
5084000	5086000	You can't just slop through the final boss battle
5086000	5088000	But yeah, I guess one of the later releases
5088000	5090000	You couldn't win if you didn't save your girlfriend
5094000	5096000	Also
5096000	5098000	There was
5098000	5100000	In the European version
5100000	5102000	The shuriken is replaced by throwing knives
5102000	5104000	Because of legal status at the time
5108000	5110000	It's
5110000	5112000	Pretty cool, actually
5112000	5114000	A bunch of the music was performed
5114000	5116000	At the fourth symphonic
5116000	5118000	Game music concert
5118000	5120000	In Leipzig
5120000	5122000	And it was also performed
5122000	5124000	At two of the concerts of play
5124000	5126000	And
5126000	5128000	It's
5128000	5130000	It was also at the
5130000	5132000	Same play concert
5132000	5134000	In Singapore in June 2007
5134000	5136000	So there you go
5136000	5138000	That's super
5138000	5140000	That's for Revenge of Shinobi
5140000	5142000	I was
5144000	5146000	Alright, there you got it
5146000	5148000	As far as game music goes too
5148000	5150000	This made Yuzo Kishiro
5150000	5152000	So if you're into game music
5152000	5154000	If you're really interested in his work
5154000	5156000	And you haven't played Revenge of Shinobi
5156000	5158000	What are you doing?
5158000	5160000	So definitely one of the most notable
5160000	5162000	Missing games from the
5162000	5164000	Genesis collection just recently came out
5164000	5166000	Revenge of Shinobi is the classic game of the week
5166000	5168000	So you'll have to check it out somehow else
5168000	5170000	Besides the classic game collection
5170000	5172000	For those of you guys checking that out this week
5172000	5174000	Good pick Dark Sakura and Dan
5174000	5176000	This week on the classic game
5176000	5178000	Of the week
5178000	5180000	And that is going to bring to a close
5180000	5182000	A new program but don't go anywhere
5182000	5184000	We'll be right back after a little break
5184000	5186000	With some more of Orange Lounge Radio
5186000	5188000	And in part beats tonight we're going to be talking
5188000	5190000	A little bit about the new website
5190000	5192000	I know it's some exciting new information
5192000	5194000	Talk a little bit about Fear 2
5194000	5196000	Grand Theft Auto 4
5196000	5198000	More Sega if you can believe it
5198000	5200000	Some very interesting trademarks
5200000	5202000	Persona 4
5202000	5204000	And Konami getting a little taste
5204000	5206000	Of their own medicine this week
5206000	5208000	We're going to be talking about that also a little bit
5208000	5210000	More of Orange Lounge Radio
5216000	5218000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
5218000	5220000	On this Sunday evening February the 15th
5220000	5222000	Of 2009 the day after
5222000	5224000	Valentine's Day
5224000	5226000	And here in studio unfortunately JTV
5226000	5228000	Stopped working
5228000	5230000	We were having problems on the server end so we just
5230000	5232000	Decided to say screw it
5232000	5234000	And we hooked up Street Fighter 4
5234000	5236000	Which is what we're playing right now on the in studio TV
5236000	5238000	We will try to get it up on Justin TV
5238000	5240000	If we're able to get back on there
5240000	5242000	We already tried reconnecting it didn't work
5242000	5244000	It's on there and it's something
5244000	5246000	Some JTV channels are up but not us
5246000	5248000	But we'll be back on Justin TV hopefully soon
5248000	5250000	And it's just going to be footage of Street Fighter 4
5250000	5252000	With us talking so that should be interesting
5252000	5254000	When people tune into that
5254000	5256000	But wow this game looks pretty awesome
5256000	5258000	Although this is not the TV to be demonstrating
5258000	5260000	That was the best ever
5260000	5262000	Dan of course is playing Dan
5262000	5264000	His namesake character
5264000	5266000	He did a little special move
5266000	5268000	He's fighting El Fuerte right now
5268000	5270000	And did this little special move that knocked him up in the air
5270000	5272000	But right at the end he did his signature little thumbs up
5272000	5274000	And tooth shining pull thing
5274000	5276000	That was great
5276000	5278000	Nice
5278000	5280000	I love that like one of the best characters
5280000	5282000	In the game
5282000	5284000	Well one of the most fun characters in the game
5284000	5286000	Is just a total joke
5286000	5288000	Very very nice though
5288000	5290000	I want to say this as well in the chat
5290000	5292000	And SSJ100Matt reminded me of this
5292000	5294000	At the top of part B as well
5294000	5296000	We got a swag bag from our New York
5296000	5298000	City contingent
5298000	5300000	Specifically SSJ100Matt I believe
5300000	5302000	Put this all together for us I don't know if he had some help
5302000	5304000	Or what have you but we want to say a big
5304000	5306000	Big thank you to them for getting
5306000	5308000	Us some of the swag including lots of
5308000	5310000	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars
5310000	5312000	Stuff which Loki took it all
5312000	5314000	But we have like a Splatterhouse poster
5314000	5316000	We're going to put up here in studio and some other cool stuff too
5316000	5318000	So we're going to fill some of the blank space on our wall
5318000	5320000	With some of those posters from
5320000	5322000	The New York Comic Con
5322000	5324000	So thank you guys very very very very much for that
5324000	5326000	Yay
5326000	5328000	Alright so I'm just like hypnotized
5328000	5330000	By Street Fighter IV now I don't even know if I can do news
5330000	5332000	I just kind of I really want to play it
5332000	5334000	I can do news
5334000	5336000	Alright Loki why don't you start us off with some news
5336000	5338000	I actually want to run in the house and get some tea
5338000	5340000	So Street Fighter IV will have to wait
5340000	5342000	And I think Dan doesn't want to give it up anyway
5342000	5344000	So why don't you get into some news Loki
5344000	5346000	He has unlocked me and the other two characters
5346000	5348000	Anyways
5348000	5350000	Fear II they had some pretty
5350000	5352000	Interesting advertisement
5352000	5354000	For Fear II in the UK
5354000	5356000	Actually they had trained
5356000	5358000	Black cats that were
5358000	5360000	Walking around and
5360000	5362000	Advertising with Fear II little
5362000	5364000	T-shirts on it's cat-vertising
5364000	5366000	So
5366000	5368000	It's pretty awesome actually and
5368000	5370000	You know I didn't know you can
5370000	5372000	Train cats so I think that's even more
5372000	5374000	Amazing right there
5374000	5376000	You can train cats? Yeah but
5376000	5378000	Cat shows really do tricks like dogs do
5378000	5380000	To be your minions of advertising?
5380000	5382000	I mean I'm surprised
5382000	5384000	But you know they didn't have their own agenda
5384000	5386000	But anyways
5386000	5388000	What's even cooler is if you happen to live
5388000	5390000	In the UK there's a number you can call to get your own
5390000	5392000	Fear II cat shirt
5392000	5394000	I totally okay
5394000	5396000	For our UK listeners somebody get me a shirt
5396000	5398000	For Shermy
5398000	5400000	Yeah
5400000	5402000	Make sure it's a 3XL cat size
5402000	5404000	And I'll
5404000	5406000	Get a fat fucking cat
5406000	5408000	I love my cat I know
5408000	5410000	And I will put it on her and model her
5410000	5412000	With the fear shirt on
5412000	5414000	You could just probably get like a
5414000	5416000	I don't know if you could
5416000	5418000	I want an official fear shirt for my cat
5418000	5420000	Oh
5420000	5422000	Well I don't know who knows
5422000	5424000	And then later on it's probably Dolphys sized
5424000	5426000	Pose
5426000	5428000	Oh sweet
5428000	5430000	See now we're just going to be distracted by Street Fighter
5430000	5432000	It's going to be terrible
5432000	5434000	Apparently yeah it's um
5434000	5436000	If you live in London
5436000	5438000	During the next few days you know you might have
5438000	5440000	Or seen you know
5440000	5442000	It was actually going on from mid-week to
5442000	5444000	About the Friday the 13th
5444000	5446000	You might have seen these cats walking around
5446000	5448000	Catpartizing
5448000	5450000	I think it's awesome I would put
5450000	5452000	One of these on my cat if she wouldn't you know claw
5452000	5454000	Me to death but
5454000	5456000	Biohaze20 in chat asks
5456000	5458000	My cat talks and smokes a lot of pot
5458000	5460000	Is that eligible for cat shows?
5460000	5462000	I don't know that might get it disqualified
5462000	5464000	Does the cat actually
5464000	5466000	Smoke pot or do you blow
5466000	5468000	Pot smoke in the cat's face?
5468000	5470000	That would be for the stoned olympics
5470000	5472000	Remember Eddie Isher talked
5472000	5474000	About the stoned olympics
5474000	5476000	What's that?
5476000	5478000	I've not heard of this
5478000	5480000	Well you're tested for drugs to make sure that you've taken enough
5480000	5482000	I see
5482000	5484000	Drugs are bad
5484000	5486000	Drugs are very bad
5486000	5488000	I think they're badass
5488000	5490000	What else is bad for you but Grand Theft Auto 4
5490000	5492000	Is very very bad for you
5492000	5494000	But that doesn't stop many of you
5494000	5496000	The Lost and the Damned of course is coming out
5496000	5498000	This coming week
5498000	5500000	The 17th
5500000	5502000	A lot of people are going to be
5502000	5504000	Very busy when that comes out
5504000	5506000	The hell with Street Fighter 4
5506000	5508000	Good thing you were able to get Street Fighter 4 early
5508000	5510000	You're going to be ready to move on
5510000	5512000	This level is beautiful
5512000	5514000	What stage is this?
5514000	5516000	This is the Midnight Jungle
5516000	5518000	Anyhow
5518000	5520000	It's going to be like this for the whole second half of the show tonight
5520000	5522000	It's okay
5522000	5524000	Grand Theft Auto 4
5524000	5526000	Lost in the Damned
5526000	5528000	Not only is it coming with
5528000	5530000	Of course all the great
5530000	5532000	Download content
5532000	5534000	A free week of multiplayer
5534000	5536000	From the 17th to the 22nd
5536000	5538000	It's called a Game with Rockstar event
5538000	5540000	You can play Lost in the Damned online
5540000	5542000	For free if you don't have Xbox Live Gold
5542000	5544000	Although I'm surprised there's that many folks
5544000	5546000	Out there that have this game and not have Xbox Live Gold
5546000	5548000	But I guess there's enough
5548000	5550000	There you go
5550000	5552000	Yeah really you need it online anyways
5552000	5554000	Because there's not much to do if you don't have it
5554000	5556000	And you beat the game
5556000	5558000	I don't know
5558000	5560000	It's weird though because even this game
5560000	5562000	When Saints Row 2 came out
5562000	5564000	I'm going to be playing Saints Row 2 a lot more than Grand Theft Auto 4
5564000	5566000	Not the case
5566000	5568000	It's so weird
5568000	5570000	I don't know
5570000	5572000	Alright
5572000	5574000	I'm going to have to interrupt here
5574000	5576000	I know that Dark Sakura is dying to do
5576000	5578000	A story here
5578000	5580000	But I have an OLR special bulletin
5580000	5582000	If you will
5582000	5584000	I need the theme music
5584000	5586000	For when we have special bulletins
5586000	5588000	I used to have a little trumpet announcement thing
5588000	5590000	We used to do
5590000	5592000	How about this Rob?
5592000	5594000	What?
5594000	5596000	That'll work
5596000	5598000	The new website is live
5598000	5600000	So check it out
5600000	5602000	Orangelaunchradio.com
5602000	5604000	And there it is
5604000	5606000	Orangelaunchradio.com is up
5606000	5608000	So check it out
5608000	5610000	You know what that earns?
5610000	5612000	What?
5612000	5614000	No in all reality though
5614000	5616000	I'm actually loading it up right now
5616000	5618000	In all reality we want to say a big big big big big
5618000	5620000	Thank you to
5620000	5622000	Deakman
5622000	5624000	And VXJsonXV
5624000	5626000	For their hard work on getting the new website up and running
5626000	5628000	What do you mean it isn't?
5628000	5630000	For everybody that put that together
5630000	5632000	It's amazing
5632000	5634000	It has a little space invader
5634000	5636000	As Tigerclaw says in chat
5636000	5638000	It's much easier on the eyes than the old site
5638000	5640000	Well maybe there are some
5640000	5642000	Splashes of other color
5642000	5644000	We're going to be adding light
5644000	5646000	When we add new stories
5646000	5648000	We can upload pictures
5648000	5650000	Do reviews work?
5650000	5652000	You can just add a review
5652000	5654000	It's a new story
5654000	5656000	So I have
5656000	5658000	I know I'm going to miss the old photo too
5658000	5660000	And in other announcements JustinTV is still networking
5660000	5662000	Alright so
5662000	5664000	Thank you guys again very much
5664000	5666000	And yay for that
5666000	5668000	So we'll talk more about the new website
5668000	5670000	I am posting photographic proof
5670000	5672000	Hold on hold on
5672000	5674000	I forgot about that there's that little thing
5674000	5676000	The gallery
5676000	5678000	If you check this out there's a new gallery on Orangelaunchradio.com
5678000	5680000	And you can go into the OL army pics
5680000	5682000	And you can look at pictures that our people have uploaded
5682000	5684000	Please don't abuse this
5684000	5686000	But Dark Soccer right now
5686000	5688000	Is taking pictures of us playing Street Fighter 4
5688000	5690000	Here in studio
5690000	5692000	And she's going to upload them to
5692000	5694000	The OL army pics gallery
5694000	5696000	There's Dark Tetsuya with an old ass
5696000	5698000	Pinball table
5698000	5700000	There's our messy floor
5700000	5702000	Some people have been uploading random stuff
5702000	5704000	Alright so Dark Soccer is working on that right now
5704000	5706000	It's like JustinTV but ghetto
5706000	5708000	So there you go
5708000	5710000	Alright let's try and go back to
5710000	5712000	Gaming news if we can
5712000	5714000	Oh we're on
5714000	5716000	Dark Soccer's turn
5716000	5718000	And she's up and taking pictures
5718000	5720000	Rezz
5720000	5722000	Hi
5722000	5724000	Rezz
5724000	5726000	Rezz an 18 wheeler
5726000	5728000	What do these two games have in common?
5730000	5732000	Sega re-registered the trademarks
5732000	5734000	For Rezz an 18 wheeler
5734000	5736000	American pro trucker
5736000	5738000	And they were Dreamcast titles as you might recall
5738000	5740000	But hey we've also got
5740000	5742000	The Rezz
5742000	5744000	Remix thingamadookie right?
5744000	5746000	Thingamadookie
5746000	5748000	Rezz HD Remix thingamadookie
5748000	5750000	Yeah for MatchingService
5750000	5752000	Dot com
5752000	5754000	But no we've uh
5754000	5756000	So they've uh
5756000	5758000	Renewed those so who knows
5758000	5760000	We may have
5760000	5762000	New truck in action with a
5762000	5764000	Really poppy soundtrack
5764000	5766000	Yeah that's what I'm hoping is that they actually combine
5766000	5768000	The two games and we get 18 wheeler
5768000	5770000	Ooh ooh ooh ooh
5770000	5772000	Uh oh
5772000	5774000	It's Sakura vs. Dan on Street Fighter 4
5774000	5776000	So
5776000	5778000	This is
5778000	5780000	Just going to bug us all night
5780000	5782000	Why are you Sakura?
5782000	5784000	Oh
5784000	5786000	Anyhow
5786000	5788000	Who knows what interesting games
5788000	5790000	Could come of these remake trademarks
5790000	5792000	I don't know
5792000	5794000	This picture is going up because this is our
5794000	5796000	Daily life at home
5796000	5798000	Dan vs. Sakura
5798000	5800000	What's interesting though
5800000	5802000	And this is kind of a rumor that's been around for a while now
5802000	5804000	In fact I remember another story about this
5804000	5806000	The Sega vintage collection
5806000	5808000	Is rumored to be coming to
5808000	5810000	Xbox Live Arcade
5810000	5812000	You may remember a while back
5812000	5814000	They had some screenshots of
5814000	5816000	The Sega vintage collection with like
5816000	5818000	The Sonic the Hedgehog games or something like that
5818000	5820000	Well apparently this vintage
5820000	5822000	Collection is supposed to be bringing
5822000	5824000	Some of the old Genesis games to
5824000	5826000	Xbox Live Arcade
5826000	5828000	Some of these games you might expect
5828000	5830000	Are Gunstar Heroes, Comic Zone
5830000	5832000	Altered Beasts, Shinobi 3
5832000	5834000	And Sonic the Hedgehog 3
5834000	5836000	Okay but
5836000	5838000	I just bought all of those games on the Mega Genesis
5838000	5840000	Collection so what's the freaking point
5840000	5842000	Gunstar Heroes not on it
5842000	5844000	Okay one game
5844000	5846000	And I also
5846000	5848000	I already bought Gunstar Hero because it was one of the first
5848000	5850000	Virtual console games on the Wii
5850000	5852000	I don't get it either but you know then again they also released
5852000	5854000	Hedgehog and stuff by Stand Alone
5854000	5856000	So maybe people
5856000	5858000	Want just one game and
5858000	5860000	It just, I don't see the value in that
5860000	5862000	And you know
5862000	5864000	I see Game Grumps says it's on PSN as well
5864000	5866000	Maybe I have the
5866000	5868000	Collection thingy on PS3 so
5868000	5870000	You know and sadly the only way that this would actually
5870000	5872000	Work as far as being you know worthwhile
5872000	5874000	Is if they had those like say 4 or 5
5874000	5876000	Games and charged like maybe
5876000	5878000	5 or 10 bucks for it or something like that
5878000	5880000	And then having it kind of like a mini
5880000	5882000	Version of that collection but at the same time
5882000	5884000	It's like what's the big deal, what's the point
5884000	5886000	Cause you can just go purchase you know 40 games
5886000	5888000	For you know 30 bucks
5888000	5890000	Or you can wait for the price drop and you'll get
5890000	5892000	40 games for 20 bucks
5892000	5894000	I don't know
5894000	5896000	I don't know either it's a little interesting
5896000	5898000	But it's a rumor right now it's coming from a
5898000	5900000	Dutch gaming site but
5900000	5902000	It's kind of weird though that we see two of these same types
5902000	5904000	Of rumors happening you know before
5904000	5906000	So I don't know
5906000	5908000	AcidicVampire in chat says achievement whores will
5908000	5910000	Buy it that's true achievement whores
5910000	5912000	Will definitely buy it
5912000	5914000	Very very true
5914000	5916000	Well
5916000	5918000	Another fighting game going on
5918000	5920000	Out there in the world not just street fighter
5920000	5922000	4 but how many of you guys
5922000	5924000	Are fans of wrestlemania
5924000	5926000	Nobody? Ok
5926000	5928000	I used to be a fan of wrestlemania
5928000	5930000	But you miss the classics right
5930000	5932000	You miss the classic wrestlemania like Hulk Hogan
5932000	5934000	And all those people well the good news is there's a
5934000	5936000	Game coming out that's just for you
5936000	5938000	It's called Legends of Wrestlemania
5938000	5940000	And this game is actually
5940000	5942000	Going to have wrestlemania greats
5942000	5944000	From like the 80's
5944000	5946000	Including look at this screenshot Andre the Giant
5946000	5948000	And Hulk Hogan
5948000	5950000	And it's going to be like a battle game
5950000	5952000	Where you can fight all these people
5952000	5954000	And just to give you a sampling
5954000	5956000	Of the 42 characters again this is a rumor
5956000	5958000	It's coming from NeoGaf
5958000	5960000	Those forums but hey
5960000	5962000	You know what if you want to put together a hell of a
5962000	5964000	Wrestlemania game this sounds like a good place to start

5996000	5998000	SHJ100Matt says
5998000	6000000	I played this at Comic Con it's a lot of fun
6000000	6002000	I wouldn't doubt it
6002000	6004000	That's an ultimate fighting game right there
6004000	6006000	That's going to be a lot of fun
6006000	6008000	Even though I'm not a big wrestlemania fan
6008000	6010000	I do remember the old school wrestlemania
6010000	6012000	On the NES that was like one of the first
6012000	6014000	Fighting games ever
6014000	6016000	That had like six of those characters
6016000	6018000	In it I remember like Macho Man was in it
6018000	6020000	And Hulk and Andre
6020000	6022000	There were like the Million Dollar Man
6022000	6024000	Had a little dollar sign he had to get
6024000	6026000	That was a power up
6026000	6028000	There was just these dumb little things in it
6028000	6030000	That made it awesome
6030000	6032000	It's kind of cool that wrestlemania lasted all this time
6032000	6034000	Didn't they just have their 25th anniversary
6034000	6036000	Or something like that?
6036000	6038000	Which one?
6038000	6040000	Wrestlemania had like a 25th anniversary or something
6040000	6042000	Just recently? I don't know they had something
6042000	6044000	It was a big anniversary for it I know
6044000	6046000	Anyhow I'm sure somebody in chat that's a big wrestling fan
6046000	6048000	Will correct me momentarily
6048000	6050000	WWF Wrestlefest
6050000	6052000	I thought it was Wrestlemania
6054000	6056000	Wrestlemania is the big one I'm thinking of
6056000	6058000	Well at any rate
6058000	6060000	How about some news from
6060000	6062000	Squenix
6062000	6064000	Squenix? Sure
6064000	6066000	Well
6066000	6068000	At any rate
6068000	6070000	The
6070000	6072000	Playstation 2 game
6072000	6074000	Persona 4
6074000	6076000	Is going to be out in the UK
6076000	6078000	On March 13th
6078000	6080000	And the PAL box is going to have
6080000	6082000	A special CD
6082000	6084000	Soundtrack
6084000	6086000	With 24 tracks
6086000	6088000	It has a new plot
6088000	6090000	New places to go
6090000	6092000	New stuff to look at
6092000	6094000	New things to kill
6094000	6096000	New spookies
6096000	6098000	And it is the same stylized
6098000	6100000	Manga pop culture art
6100000	6102000	To go in the game
6102000	6104000	So
6104000	6106000	Go check it out for when it's out
6106000	6108000	And actually it's supposed to be
6108000	6110000	Not too far off
6110000	6112000	From the style of Persona 3
6112000	6114000	So
6114000	6116000	Go for it
6116000	6118000	They're just using the same engine for Persona 3
6118000	6120000	If I remember right
6120000	6122000	Just milking money out of it
6122000	6124000	But hey you know what actually
6124000	6126000	There's a lot of love out there for Persona 3
6126000	6128000	And I haven't played it personally
6128000	6130000	But I hear it's very in depth
6130000	6132000	And it's pretty cool
6132000	6134000	Very very cool
6134000	6136000	Well you can check it out now
6136000	6138000	It's already out
6138000	6140000	In the US at least
6140000	6142000	At some point
6142000	6144000	Alright so
6144000	6146000	Some other cool stuff
6146000	6148000	Well actually it isn't very cool
6148000	6150000	It's kind of typical for Nintendo
6150000	6152000	People trying to exploit them
6152000	6154000	For any sort of class action lawsuit
6154000	6156000	This time it's not really related
6156000	6158000	To wrist straps or throwing stuff through TVs
6158000	6160000	Apparently
6160000	6162000	This guy Michael
6162000	6164000	Tortilla
6164000	6166000	Not Tortilla but Tortilla
6166000	6168000	He's a fitness expert
6168000	6170000	And apparently a host of some
6170000	6172000	AMTalk radio show called
6172000	6174000	Shape Up America
6174000	6176000	And he has announced plans that he's gonna
6176000	6178000	File a class action lawsuit against Nintendo
6178000	6180000	Claiming that they're injuring
6180000	6182000	Or that people are getting injured
6182000	6184000	Playing Wii games because
6184000	6186000	Nintendo isn't telling people to properly
6186000	6188000	Warm up before doing exercise
6188000	6190000	He claims that
6190000	6192000	Wii Fit has led the people
6192000	6194000	Sustaining injuries in their knees
6194000	6196000	Back in risk because
6196000	6198000	Overuse of improper warm up
6198000	6200000	And
6200000	6202000	Just
6202000	6204000	I don't know I think this is kind of a stretch
6204000	6206000	I mean that's just like saying
6206000	6208000	Oh well you know
6208000	6210000	I got up and walked down the stairs
6210000	6212000	But my TV didn't tell me to warm up
6212000	6214000	Before I did activity
6214000	6216000	On top of that actually
6216000	6220000	This is something that people have been doing for years
6220000	6222000	Before you do any physical activity
6222000	6224000	It's a good idea
6224000	6226000	Even before stretching it's a good idea
6226000	6228000	To warm up your muscles
6228000	6230000	Before you even stretch
6230000	6232000	Or you're at risk for injury
6232000	6234000	In the tendons and tissue
6234000	6236000	I mean that's just
6236000	6238000	Should be common sense stuff that they teach you
6238000	6240000	When you're in school
6240000	6242000	Well I think this is kind of pointless anyways because
6242000	6244000	The Wii games aren't necessarily
6244000	6246000	High impact I mean
6246000	6248000	Wii sports tennis does not need
6248000	6250000	To be high impact it doesn't sense
6250000	6252000	You swing the
6252000	6254000	Wii mote like a tennis racket
6254000	6256000	You know you don't have to do that
6256000	6258000	You just have to move your wrist I mean
6258000	6260000	That's not
6260000	6262000	Their fault it's the fault of people playing it
6262000	6264000	That are getting way too into the game
6264000	6266000	And hurting themselves
6266000	6268000	GS68 in the chat room has a good point
6268000	6270000	At chat dot orange lounge radio dot com
6270000	6272000	He says DDR doesn't tell people to stretch either
6272000	6274000	And it's been getting you know away with it
6274000	6276000	For so so long right?
6276000	6278000	Yeah it just
6278000	6280000	It shouldn't even be a thing it's a frivolous
6280000	6282000	Lawsuit it's gonna get thrown out
6284000	6286000	I agree and you know what frivolous lawsuits
6286000	6288000	I don't know about you guys but frivolous lawsuits
6288000	6290000	Make me angry and uh
6290000	6292000	When we get angry here at orange lounge radio we cue
6292000	6294000	That nasty music and say some nasty things
6294000	6310000	Music
6310000	6312000	I have two FUs
6312000	6314000	Um the first one being the internet
6314000	6316000	Connection at my house
6316000	6318000	Because of the damn wind
6318000	6320000	Which this really isn't like
6320000	6322000	Wind but unfortunately
6322000	6324000	Sacramento has no idea
6324000	6326000	What to do when a tree moves
6326000	6328000	To be fair California in general
6328000	6330000	Yeah
6330000	6332000	But I mean
6332000	6334000	Plan for the fucking wind
6334000	6336000	We get wind storms here every so often
6336000	6338000	So just plan for it
6338000	6340000	And be prepared
6340000	6342000	For everything constant vigilance
6342000	6344000	And then um
6344000	6346000	My other FU goes
6346000	6348000	Towards um
6348000	6350000	Half dot com
6350000	6352000	The school book that I ordered
6352000	6354000	That still hasn't arrived
6354000	6356000	But um I will say that I don't think I got
6356000	6358000	Charged for it so
6358000	6360000	I have to go find the damn thing again
6360000	6362000	And I don't want to buy it from school
6362000	6364000	Because school is fucking expensive
6364000	6366000	I would rather
6366000	6368000	Be frugal because I have
6368000	6370000	Things that my money is better spent on
6370000	6372000	The end
6372000	6374000	Um
6374000	6376000	Loki do you have any FUs of the week?
6376000	6378000	Yeah FU to the rain because for the second
6378000	6380000	Week now in a row it has ruined my
6380000	6382000	Plans to go airsofting
6382000	6384000	And it's really pissing me off because
6384000	6386000	I wanted to go like weeks ago now
6386000	6388000	I have all the equipment all the ammo
6388000	6390000	Everything I'm ready to go
6390000	6392000	And it keeps fucking raining and
6392000	6394000	It always rains like on the weekend
6394000	6396000	It's dry through the week and then it starts
6396000	6398000	Raining and then wind and ugh
6398000	6400000	But so now this next
6400000	6402000	Week I'm hoping to be able to go
6402000	6404000	Airsofting it might actually have to be
6404000	6406000	That Saturday instead of Sunday morning
6406000	6408000	Which is annoying but
6408000	6410000	Actdeft in chat has a suggestion for you
6410000	6412000	He says blame it on the rain
6412000	6414000	Yeah yeah
6414000	6416000	Forget it
6416000	6418000	Ah that's funny but right now
6418000	6420000	Um I have a feeling
6420000	6422000	Though it's gonna still be raining next week
6422000	6424000	Fucking weather yeah sure it doesn't rain
6424000	6426000	All you know before this and now
6426000	6428000	All of a sudden it's just like oh rain rain rain
6428000	6430000	Rain rain rain more rain
6432000	6434000	Alright well my FU of the week
6434000	6436000	Goes to having the worst Valentine's
6436000	6438000	Day ever ever
6438000	6440000	Because I was sick and I was having what you call
6440000	6442000	Horizontal day that means I was lying on the couch
6442000	6444000	All day long so yeah made Valentine's
6444000	6446000	Day kinda suck so
6446000	6448000	And I was just bored and lonely
6448000	6450000	And sad so
6450000	6452000	You know I just wanted a hug is that so wrong
6452000	6454000	But yeah Valentine's
6454000	6456000	Day sucks but what is this just another day right
6456000	6458000	Uh Dan do you have any FUs of the week real quick
6460000	6462000	Just wanted to say FU to Ryu
6462000	6464000	Keep kicking my ass
6464000	6466000	And that's about it
6466000	6468000	Alright there you have it FU to Ryu
6468000	6470000	Alright
6470000	6472000	That's gonna do it for the FUs of the week but let's get back into some gaming
6472000	6474000	News and guess what the lawsuit stories are
6474000	6476000	Not over that's right uh
6476000	6478000	Guess who got sued this time though it's almost
6478000	6480000	A twist of fate you know how like
6480000	6482000	There's this running inside joke that like
6482000	6484000	Konami will sue like you know ever
6484000	6486000	Since they sued Rockstar which I still think they
6486000	6488000	Were in the right to sue them
6488000	6490000	I agree they were totally in the right
6490000	6492000	But some of the lawsuits since then have been
6492000	6494000	A little interesting well now
6494000	6496000	The tables have gotten turned Konami
6496000	6498000	Got sued this week yup
6498000	6500000	So now it's not Konami will sue it's
6500000	6502000	Konami got sued uh Viacom
6502000	6504000	And Harmonix sued
6504000	6506000	Konami over the game
6506000	6508000	Rock Revolution they say
6508000	6510000	That Rock Revolution violates their patents
6510000	6512000	For musical instrument peripherals
6512000	6514000	But wait a minute
6514000	6516000	Um didn't Konami kind of
6516000	6518000	Invent the well nevermind
6518000	6520000	Anyhow uh the complaint was
6520000	6522000	Filed this week in a federal court in
6522000	6524000	Boston which is where Harmonix is based
6524000	6526000	The complaint wants to stop the sales of
6526000	6528000	Rock Revolution and wants cash compensation
6528000	6530000	Well please the sales were already
6530000	6532000	Stopped I don't know I don't think you need it
6532000	6534000	Done Matt done there you go
6534000	6536000	You win congrats
6536000	6538000	Um I don't know
6538000	6540000	But I guess well more so they probably want
6540000	6542000	Cash for it and they probably want
6542000	6544000	Uh I don't know some type of
6544000	6546000	Uh I would say you know
6546000	6548000	It's sad to say I would say that Rock Revolution
6548000	6550000	Impacted the sale
6550000	6552000	Of Rock Band in no way whatsoever
6552000	6554000	I know for real right
6554000	6556000	I can't say I can't honestly say there has been
6556000	6558000	One person on the face of the earth that said
6558000	6560000	Ooh Rock Revolution that's way better than
6560000	6562000	Rock Band
6562000	6564000	But this is so strange apparently
6564000	6566000	Even though the Viacom patent um
6566000	6568000	Says that it improved on earlier
6568000	6570000	Video game music controllers and even kind of references
6570000	6572000	Beatmania uh
6572000	6574000	They're still but this is the weird thing
6574000	6576000	About it Konami didn't put out
6576000	6578000	A new guitar with this game
6578000	6580000	They put out a new drum set
6580000	6582000	Which probably sold five of them
6582000	6584000	Unless the internals of the drum set are you know
6584000	6586000	Something similar to what's you know
6586000	6588000	Put out there but their drum set
6588000	6590000	Looked like their old drum set for Drummania
6590000	6592000	I mean it
6592000	6594000	Looked like crap and it
6594000	6596000	Apparently played like crap so I don't understand
6596000	6598000	I don't know
6598000	6600000	Other than maybe it's like well fine you
6600000	6602000	Sue us but we're gonna sue you back
6602000	6604000	We'll sue you too
6604000	6606000	SSJ100 Matt
6606000	6608000	SSJ100 Matt in chat says uh
6608000	6610000	Aaron or YYR takes pride
6610000	6612000	That Snake 360 has outsold
6612000	6614000	Rock Revolution
6614000	6616000	That's probably a true fact I wouldn't doubt that at all
6616000	6618000	I wouldn't doubt it
6618000	6620000	He does have gut mechanics
6620000	6622000	We got um Rufus
6622000	6624000	Rufus now fighting by the way they're saying
6624000	6626000	Justin TV's back up you might want to try to connect one more time
6626000	6628000	On the thing then the folks can see this
6628000	6630000	And at least the live listeners
6630000	6632000	Will get to understand what we're talking about
6632000	6634000	Even if the podcast listeners are screwed
6634000	6636000	Nope still not working
6636000	6638000	No that's a bummer
6638000	6640000	Alright well anyhow
6640000	6642000	Yeah it'll be interesting to see how this one
6642000	6644000	Turns out I wonder if they'll settle I wonder if
6644000	6646000	Somebody's just trying to make a point I have no
6646000	6648000	Idea yeah frisbee in our chat room sums it up
6648000	6650000	Lawsuit ping pong that's
6650000	6652000	Exactly what appears to be happening here
6652000	6654000	I cannot see
6654000	6656000	There's no case here I mean it's just
6656000	6658000	You know it didn't affect
6658000	6660000	Their sales at all I mean
6660000	6662000	It really the sales of rock revolution
6662000	6664000	Were so friggin poor
6664000	6666000	That I don't see how they can say
6666000	6668000	Oh well our sales were impacted
6668000	6670000	You know if it's guitar hero rock band
6670000	6672000	Maybe there's you know something there but
6672000	6674000	And I know it seems like we're always
6674000	6676000	Siding with Konami on this show but
6676000	6678000	You know don't take that too
6678000	6680000	Much because honestly we're just saying
6680000	6682000	That having to put your name on
6682000	6684000	Rock revolution was punishment enough
6684000	6686000	I mean it's not good
6686000	6688000	You know financial
6688000	6690000	Liability I don't think
6690000	6692000	Is warranted but what do I know I'm not a judge
6692000	6694000	I mean I can say maybe that
6694000	6696000	They I don't think they
6696000	6698000	Do they have vocals in rock revolution
6698000	6700000	I don't think they did I don't think they're the
6700000	6702000	Actual songs I think they're
6702000	6704000	Oh yeah no you don't sing along I think it's
6704000	6706000	All cover bands
6706000	6708000	So
6708000	6710000	Hell I don't know
6710000	6712000	Whatever it's what the point it's what's the
6712000	6714000	Point the game yeah
6714000	6716000	Something like that well here's something that our
6716000	6718000	World of warcraft listeners will be more interested in
6718000	6720000	Yay
6720000	6722000	Have you actually gone back to play
6722000	6724000	Not yet but what you're about to tell us might
6724000	6726000	I'm very proud of you
6726000	6728000	Oh my god it's still moving
6728000	6730000	Sorry I'm very proud of you
6730000	6732000	If you've resisted the urge
6732000	6734000	I have it's been like three weeks now
6734000	6736000	Ooh tap that vein
6736000	6738000	Well
6738000	6740000	There's more about the dual talent
6740000	6742000	Stuff in case
6742000	6744000	You were interested
6744000	6746000	Um you know the dual talent
6746000	6748000	Spec system is coming out in the game
6748000	6750000	Um
6750000	6752000	And it's going to have
6752000	6754000	It to where you can switch
6754000	6756000	Your characters between your
6756000	6758000	Customization setups
6758000	6760000	One for rating one for pvp
6760000	6762000	And possibly one you know
6762000	6764000	Between you know one for healing and one for
6764000	6766000	For damaging
6766000	6768000	Um the option is only going to be available
6768000	6770000	Um
6770000	6772000	If once you have hit
6772000	6774000	Level 80 first
6774000	6776000	And um
6776000	6778000	Basically the reason
6778000	6780000	Is um according to
6780000	6782000	Greg Street who is uh
6782000	6784000	Ghostcrawler
6784000	6786000	That they didn't want to make the game more complex
6786000	6788000	For lower levels who are still trying to learn
6788000	6790000	Their class
6790000	6792000	Um but there
6792000	6794000	He said if it proves popular then they will
6794000	6796000	Consider expanding it
6796000	6798000	She'll basically pay a one time fee
6798000	6800000	Um to your in game
6800000	6802000	Class trainer
6802000	6804000	To access your dual specs and after
6804000	6806000	That you can switch between
6806000	6808000	Um the two at any lexicon
6808000	6810000	Of power in any city
6810000	6812000	Um
6812000	6814000	Also if you
6814000	6816000	Have the inscription profession
6816000	6818000	You can sell portable lexicon
6818000	6820000	Of power that will require
6820000	6822000	A group of players to summon and use
6822000	6824000	Anywhere but during combat
6824000	6826000	Or in arena
6826000	6828000	So nice
6828000	6830000	So you can switch roles in the middle
6830000	6832000	Of a raid
6832000	6834000	Basically like if you need
6834000	6836000	For instance I'm thinking in Naxxramas
6836000	6838000	You can get through most of the um
6838000	6840000	Event with just two healers but it's really
6840000	6842000	Nice to have a third healer
6842000	6844000	For four horsemen so just imagine
6844000	6846000	Before you engage four horsemen okay let's summon
6846000	6848000	The lexicon of power and we're going to have our druid
6848000	6850000	Switch from uh Boomkin to resto I mean that's
6850000	6852000	That's going to be a that's going to change
6852000	6854000	The dynamics big time
6854000	6856000	Well with the specs themselves
6856000	6858000	You'll get um the dual setup
6858000	6860000	With your action bars and your glyphs
6860000	6862000	That will just switch automatically
6862000	6864000	When you change over to the other spec
6864000	6866000	Um
6866000	6868000	There will also be a gear manager
6868000	6870000	That will allow you to change between
6870000	6872000	Your equippable items
6872000	6874000	Um for or you know
6874000	6876000	Whether they be individual
6876000	6878000	Or entire equipment sets
6878000	6880000	Between the two specs
6880000	6882000	So
6882000	6884000	So it's it seems pretty complex
6884000	6886000	Um
6886000	6888000	But they're actually saying that it's
6888000	6890000	Going to be on the public test server soon
6890000	6892000	But not immediately
6892000	6894000	Available um
6894000	6896000	And that the gear it they said though
6896000	6898000	That it would be starting off with
6898000	6900000	Possibly the next content patch
6900000	6902000	But the gear manager is not going to be
6902000	6904000	Um at the same time it'll fall later
6904000	6906000	Yeah it'll probably
6906000	6908000	It'll probably be a little while before we actually see this
6908000	6910000	Go into the game but I think they're doing the
6910000	6912000	Star patch is what 3.1
6912000	6914000	And so that's probably when we'll start seeing
6914000	6916000	Dual specing but the gear thing will probably
6916000	6918000	Be a little while so
6918000	6920000	There you go and uh
6920000	6922000	The chat
6922000	6924000	The chat is uh making fun
6924000	6926000	Of me for knowing exactly all this
6926000	6928000	WoW talk and all that
6928000	6930000	I was sitting here wondering if you were speaking another language
6930000	6932000	Oh shut up
6932000	6934000	Somewhere out there there are listeners of this
6934000	6936000	Program that play WoW that understand perfectly
6936000	6938000	Well what I just said
6938000	6940000	There are some people who quit
6940000	6942000	Who understand what you're talking about
6942000	6944000	There you go there you go
6944000	6946000	Alright so then we better talk about another gamer
6946000	6948000	I'm going to get right back on the WoW bandwagon
6948000	6950000	Luckily I have Street Fighter 4
6950000	6952000	To ogle over and Dan is right now on the last boss
6952000	6954000	Seth who looks like um
6954000	6956000	He looks like the glowing guy
6956000	6958000	From the Watchmen trailers to me
6958000	6960000	That's what he looks like
6960000	6962000	Uh yeah and he's a cheap bastard
6962000	6964000	That has like the um specials
6964000	6966000	From a whole bunch of different characters
6966000	6968000	Um I don't know
6968000	6970000	This is not Doral
6970000	6972000	Thank you Tigerclaw
6972000	6974000	Doctor Manhattan that's what I was trying to think of
6974000	6976000	He looks like Doctor Manhattan to me
6976000	6978000	He also has very um
6978000	6980000	Abnormal muscles
6980000	6982000	In a true anatomical sense
6982000	6984000	He ate a spinning ying yang
6984000	6986000	No no no no I'm talking about
6986000	6988000	He has got like um
6988000	6990000	Going down from a solar plexus
6990000	6992000	In between his ribs
6992000	6994000	To between his major abdominals
6994000	6996000	He's got a whole ridge of like
6996000	6998000	Bonus muscles
6998000	7000000	That don't exist
7000000	7002000	Sorry I noticed this stuff
7002000	7004000	I'm just messing
7004000	7006000	Alright sorry Loki
7006000	7008000	He's got extra muscles in his ass
7008000	7010000	Anyways
7010000	7012000	There's a game coming out on
7012000	7014000	PC and
7014000	7016000	In April and possibly
7016000	7018000	Well in the PS3 I guess in
7018000	7020000	Quarter 3 this year
7020000	7022000	Free Realms it's a free mmo RPG
7022000	7024000	And it's uh I guess
7024000	7026000	Kinda geared towards kids
7026000	7028000	And uh you will be able to play it for free
7028000	7030000	On the Playstation Network
7030000	7032000	Um whenever that happens to come out
7032000	7034000	So that's kinda neat
7034000	7036000	And it's um I guess
7036000	7038000	I don't know if it's gonna be I'm assuming
7038000	7040000	It's one of those free to play but you have to
7040000	7042000	Pay for upgrade type you know things
7042000	7044000	But uh hey free's good I guess
7044000	7046000	It doesn't look that bad
7046000	7050000	But I don't know I haven't really played it
7052000	7054000	Well okay then
7054000	7056000	Well Street Fighter 4
7056000	7058000	Mania is sweeping not just
7058000	7060000	The US but Japan and
7060000	7062000	When do I say Mania I mean
7062000	7064000	Mania 86,000
7064000	7066000	Copies sold in the first day alone
7066000	7068000	In Japan and if that doesn't
7068000	7070000	Sound like a lot of copies you need to
7070000	7072000	Understand this they are sold out in
7072000	7074000	Japan you can't find this game in Japan right now
7074000	7076000	86,000 was the first pressing
7076000	7078000	And uh it's gone
7078000	7080000	Uh apparently they are gonna try and crank some more
7080000	7082000	Of these guys out as fast as they can but uh
7082000	7084000	Right now they're like Nintendo Wii's
7084000	7086000	Trying to find these guys
7086000	7088000	Not easy I wonder if the same thing
7088000	7090000	Is gonna happen over here in the US I don't think fighting games
7090000	7092000	Are as big here but I
7092000	7094000	Definitely think this is the type of thing that you're probably
7094000	7096000	Gonna be hoping you had a pre-order for
7096000	7098000	Or you're gonna have to run to Best Buy when they open or
7098000	7100000	The stores that don't do actually even Best Buy does pre-orders now
7100000	7102000	Huh who doesn't do pre-orders
7102000	7104000	Circuit City well look what happened to them
7104000	7106000	Kmart doesn't do pre-orders so you'll have to run
7106000	7108000	To Kmart at noon that's true if you ever want to get
7108000	7110000	A game on launch day go to Kmart because no one
7110000	7112000	Shops at Kmart if you remember the old
7112000	7114000	Orange launch radio piece of advice
7114000	7116000	No one shops at Kmart
7116000	7118000	Actually I shop at Kmart now
7118000	7120000	You know why? Because the target
7120000	7122000	Right over here by the house
7122000	7124000	Is closed for remodeling till October
7124000	7126000	They're turning into an Uber
7126000	7128000	Target or whatever
7128000	7130000	Yeah I think it's turning into a Greatland
7130000	7132000	So the target is closed
7132000	7134000	For the foreseeable future
7134000	7136000	And I will not go to Walmart
7136000	7138000	So and
7138000	7140000	The other target Greatland is kind of a ways away
7140000	7142000	Why won't you go to Walmart? I'll just go to
7142000	7144000	Because it's dirty in its ghetto
7144000	7146000	Well that's because it's the Rancho Cambodia
7146000	7148000	Walmart because it makes you hate humanity
7148000	7150000	For real
7150000	7152000	So I would rather go to Kmart honestly
7152000	7154000	So there you go
7154000	7156000	How's that for some rule reversal?
7156000	7158000	Misty says hey I shop at Kmart right after Christmas
7158000	7160000	Got some cute jeans
7160000	7162000	There you go
7162000	7164000	They came from the 80s?
7164000	7166000	Are the jeans bedazzled
7166000	7168000	In the back
7168000	7170000	That type of 80s style
7170000	7172000	No they're stonewashed
7172000	7174000	Rob
7174000	7176000	They're acid washed
7176000	7178000	Nice
7178000	7180000	Alright
7180000	7182000	Can we move on?
7182000	7184000	Why am I actually explaining
7184000	7186000	The difference between Target and Target Greatland
7186000	7188000	Greatland has more shopping
7188000	7190000	I'm not even being paid
7190000	7192000	More grocery shopping
7192000	7194000	Not a full grocery store
7194000	7196000	It's like a Super Walmart without being awesome
7196000	7198000	Without the produce and without the beef
7198000	7200000	Anyhow sorry
7200000	7202000	I'm done with Street Fighter IV
7202000	7204000	Did you want to talk about the next game Dark Sakura?
7204000	7206000	Well
7206000	7208000	How about some Star Trek Online
7208000	7210000	How about it?
7210000	7212000	We were talking about the character trailer last week
7212000	7214000	And it's pretty
7214000	7216000	They're saying the O.L.Aureans
7216000	7218000	The official alien race
7218000	7220000	Of Orange Dodge Radio and yes
7220000	7222000	They are orange
7222000	7224000	Well maybe
7224000	7226000	But they're actually saying
7226000	7228000	There will not
7228000	7230000	Be
7230000	7232000	Any famous
7232000	7234000	Star Trek personas
7234000	7236000	Available in Star Trek Online
7238000	7240000	They're basically saying
7240000	7242000	It's in the future where the majority of the
7242000	7244000	Known characters have passed
7244000	7246000	On except for the ones that are robots
7246000	7248000	Holograms, ghosts
7248000	7250000	Etc, etc
7250000	7252000	Or Spock
7252000	7254000	So we could see data?
7254000	7256000	No he died
7256000	7258000	Oh that's right
7258000	7260000	Damn it
7260000	7262000	I don't remember
7262000	7264000	Ok trackies help me out
7264000	7266000	What happened to Lure?
7266000	7268000	I think he got disassembled
7268000	7270000	There's always more of them
7270000	7272000	I want Q
7272000	7274000	I want there to be a freaking Q mission
7274000	7276000	And I want a Q mission
7276000	7278000	Ok
7282000	7284000	However they have actually
7284000	7286000	Been talking to
7286000	7288000	Some
7288000	7290000	Other folks
7290000	7292000	And
7292000	7294000	They don't really
7294000	7296000	I don't think they've ruled it out
7296000	7298000	Cryptocast hasn't ruled it out
7298000	7300000	It's not likely
7300000	7302000	Although who knows what might happen
7302000	7304000	With those transporter accidents
7306000	7308000	Oh Dan's
7308000	7310000	Bringing out the big guns
7310000	7312000	Dan is still trying to fight the last boss
7312000	7314000	Of the game and is having trouble
7314000	7316000	He's a cheap bitch
7316000	7318000	It's why he can't beat him
7318000	7320000	It's massive jaw
7320000	7322000	Did Seth suck you in
7322000	7324000	His stomach and then shoot you out?
7324000	7326000	Because that's what it looked like in that one part
7326000	7328000	That's disgusting
7328000	7330000	It's massive jaw
7330000	7332000	Versus person with
7332000	7334000	Who's been taking too much collodial silver
7334000	7336000	You know that turned you blue for real
7336000	7338000	Wow
7338000	7340000	You're a chemistry nerd
7340000	7342000	I'm not I just happen to know that because
7342000	7344000	I have an odd interest in skin diseases
7344000	7346000	Right we're going to get to the mailbag here soon
7346000	7348000	But a couple more stories for you first
7348000	7350000	Well guess what there's a new artist coming to
7350000	7352000	Rock band
7352000	7354000	Is it someone good?
7354000	7356000	No it's not Miley Cyrus
7356000	7358000	Danny Minogue
7358000	7360000	It's Snoop Dogg
7360000	7362000	Just when I think of
7362000	7364000	Rock band I think of Snoop Dogg
7364000	7366000	Yes Snoop Dogg
7366000	7368000	He is coming to Rock band
7368000	7370000	Download content
7370000	7372000	No word on what
7372000	7374000	Songs they're actually going to put in Rock band
7374000	7376000	But I don't know many of them
7376000	7378000	That are rock-ish
7378000	7380000	I don't know
7380000	7382000	Who cares let's just play Gin and Juice
7382000	7384000	Act deaf says
7384000	7386000	Faux shizzle
7386000	7388000	You want to go riding with the homies
7388000	7390000	Wasn't that Coolio?
7390000	7392000	Coolio is rolling with the homies
7392000	7394000	Coolioer
7394000	7396000	Sorry
7396000	7398000	Please tell me there's some other bands
7398000	7400000	That make more sense for Rock band
7400000	7402000	Yeah there's some other stuff coming too
7402000	7404000	White Zombie
7404000	7406000	Which makes me happy
7406000	7408000	There's two songs from White Zombie
7408000	7410000	Black Sunshine and More Human Than Human
7410000	7412000	More Human Than Human
7412000	7414000	I love that song
7414000	7416000	Wasted Again by Turbo Negro
7416000	7418000	Those are coming this week to
7418000	7420000	Rock band
7420000	7422000	The only bad thing about White Zombie is they really make me want to break things
7422000	7424000	Like when I listen to their music
7424000	7426000	Don't you want to break stuff?
7426000	7428000	No but
7428000	7430000	Going back to the whole
7430000	7432000	Hip-Hop artists being in Rock band
7432000	7434000	There was actually a remix of
7434000	7436000	Some
7436000	7438000	Not Tupac
7438000	7440000	Some actual
7440000	7442000	Puff Daddy song
7442000	7444000	I think that was
7444000	7446000	They did a Rock version of
7446000	7448000	That would be pretty
7448000	7450000	Fit for Rock band although I think it's kind of old
7450000	7452000	I remember seeing this back when I was playing
7452000	7454000	Qzar
7454000	7456000	Years ago
7456000	7458000	You know what song I'm surprised they haven't put in there?
7458000	7460000	Is the Public Enemy Anthrax
7460000	7462000	Bring the Noise
7462000	7464000	Where is that?
7464000	7466000	Or I was going to suggest
7466000	7468000	The Run DMC in Aerosmith
7468000	7470000	But that was actually in the Aerosmith
7470000	7472000	Guitar Hero wasn't it?
7472000	7474000	That was in Guitar Hero Aerosmith
7474000	7476000	We need actual rocking out
7476000	7478000	We need Anthrax
7478000	7480000	Anthrax and Public Enemy
7480000	7482000	I still say we need GWAR
7482000	7484000	We need GWAR
7484000	7486000	GWAR
7486000	7488000	We need Rock band GWAR
7488000	7490000	Or Rob Zombie
7490000	7492000	I'd be good with Rob Zombie even though White Zombie
7492000	7494000	They have some Rob Zombie
7494000	7496000	Anyhow
7496000	7498000	Let's do some more news
7498000	7500000	I have one more story here
7500000	7502000	It's about G.I. Joe
7502000	7504000	Naturally they're making a game
7504000	7506000	Out of the new movie
7506000	7508000	Which I'm sure a lot of folks saw
7508000	7510000	It's coming out soon
7510000	7512000	EA was actually showing off the game
7512000	7514000	At the little convention that was going on
7514000	7516000	Apparently MTV blog
7516000	7518000	Actually interviewed
7518000	7520000	The folks behind the G.I. Joe game and found out
7520000	7522000	Knowing is half the battle
7522000	7524000	PSAs
7524000	7526000	They're going to be in the game
7526000	7528000	If you do well as you play the G.I. Joe game
7528000	7530000	You will unlock vintage
7530000	7532000	Educational clips
7532000	7534000	Where G.I. Joe comes out and does
7534000	7536000	This little spiel and says
7536000	7538000	And now you know and knowing is half the battle
7538000	7540000	So that's pretty amazing
7540000	7542000	So awesome
7542000	7544000	Now you have a reason to get this
7544000	7546000	If you don't have them all
7546000	7548000	On Beta Max tape or something like that
7548000	7550000	I don't know
7550000	7552000	Anyhow let's take a minute
7552000	7554000	To open up the old mail bag
7554000	7556000	And see what you guys have to say
7556000	7558000	Every week you guys email us
7558000	7560000	At mailbagorangelaunchradio.com
7560000	7562000	We rip open the email bag
7562000	7564000	And see what you guys have to say
7564000	7566000	Nothing no mail
7566000	7568000	That's a lie I saw at least three in there earlier
7568000	7570000	There's three
7570000	7572000	Sup lords of O.L.R
7572000	7574000	As you maybe know
7574000	7576000	I listened and wrote this
7576000	7578000	Misg
7578000	7580000	On my iTouch
7580000	7582000	Last Sunday I wept because
7582000	7584000	I tried to listen live on allgames.com
7584000	7586000	But it didn't work
7586000	7588000	FOUNTY FACE
7588000	7590000	How can you guys broadcast live to iTouch
7590000	7592000	And hell even PSP listeners
7592000	7594000	Other than that I told you I got
7594000	7596000	Endwar last week
7596000	7598000	And beat it in five hours and lied to Blockbuster
7598000	7600000	About it being broken
7600000	7602000	LOL I'm just cheap like that
7602000	7604000	The game was basically Company of Heroes
7604000	7606000	On the PC with mic support
7606000	7608000	Which was state of the art
7608000	7610000	And worked
7610000	7612000	My brother just picked up four kickass games today
7612000	7614000	Random capitalization
7614000	7616000	And this weekend is gonna kickass too
7616000	7618000	The games were
7618000	7620000	Gears of War 2, GTA 4,
7620000	7622000	Rainbow Six, Vegas 2, and Lost Planet
7622000	7624000	I've got an ass ton
7624000	7626000	Of games to play
7626000	7628000	I'll tell you what I thought of them next time
7628000	7630000	Until the next email you hear from me
7630000	7632000	Goodbye
7632000	7634000	This is from RJ
7634000	7636000	Um
7636000	7638000	I am gonna say this
7638000	7640000	Given how much texting I do
7640000	7642000	On my iPhone
7642000	7644000	It is possible to
7644000	7646000	Capitalize and use proper grammar
7646000	7648000	And spell shit correctly
7648000	7650000	Especially when it fixes it for you
7650000	7652000	Other than that
7652000	7654000	Really the only way
7654000	7656000	To really listen to the podcast
7656000	7658000	Through your
7658000	7660000	iPod or iPhone
7660000	7662000	Is gonna be
7662000	7664000	To download the
7664000	7666000	Podcast
7666000	7668000	We don't have it available live
7668000	7670000	And the PSP is the
7670000	7672000	I thought we had a live player on PSP
7672000	7674000	We do, you have to be on
7674000	7676000	The PSP to see it though
7676000	7678000	So yeah
7678000	7680000	You gotta
7680000	7682000	Next email
7682000	7684000	Um
7684000	7686000	Rini here
7686000	7688000	With greetings to the three hosts
7688000	7690000	And Ferret
7690000	7692000	He says hello as well
7692000	7694000	I'd like to
7694000	7696000	Take this particular email to hype a game
7696000	7698000	It's not necessarily
7698000	7700000	About the gameplay itself but more the
7700000	7702000	Experience
7702000	7704000	I initially meant this towards Sky and Dark Sakura
7704000	7706000	Loki may not get it
7706000	7708000	But he may be mildly amused
7708000	7710000	But I thought oh well let's get your listeners in this
7710000	7712000	Before I say the name of the game
7712000	7714000	I'd like to ask for any chat room listeners
7714000	7716000	Who have played it to not spoil
7716000	7718000	Anything about the game
7718000	7720000	I guess that was in caps so I screamed it
7720000	7722000	Thank you
7722000	7724000	The name of the game is Aversion
7724000	7726000	To compel everyone to play this simple
7726000	7728000	Game here are a few reasons
7728000	7730000	It's free and played on your PC
7730000	7732000	With low system requirements
7732000	7734000	It's two hours
7734000	7736000	It's a platformer but it's not very hard
7736000	7738000	And lastly it's cute with a secret
7738000	7740000	Oooh Navy Seals
7740000	7742000	And again it's meant to be
7742000	7744000	An experience
7744000	7746000	And worth it for the true ending
7746000	7748000	And there are two endings
7748000	7750000	Here's the link for everyone
7750000	7752000	It's zarat.us

7760000	7762000	Hold on
7762000	7764000	Rob
7764000	7766000	Sorry
7766000	7768000	I'm dying here
7768000	7770000	And
7770000	7772000	They're doing other things
7772000	7774000	He's
7774000	7776000	He's working on Disney TV
7776000	7778000	Because it says it's working but it's not working
7778000	7780000	It's the
7780000	7782000	Phantom working
7782000	7784000	See Seth
7784000	7786000	Is a cheap bastard
7786000	7788000	You know
7788000	7790000	The first round you can hand him
7790000	7792000	He's like oh I suck
7792000	7794000	And then the second round he's like eh you're dead
7794000	7796000	And they're like well you might win
7796000	7798000	Aw
7798000	7800000	See that's why you have to switch it to one round
7800000	7802000	Per battle and then
7802000	7804000	The first round he was like
7804000	7806000	I can't even fight
7806000	7808000	I'm like yeah
7808000	7810000	Alright
7812000	7814000	Extra credit to Sky
7814000	7816000	If he'll make a video of himself playing the game blind
7816000	7818000	Never playing it before
7818000	7820000	Not literally blind
7820000	7822000	Now I'm going to poke his eyes out
7822000	7824000	With audio commentary and uploading it to the neglected
7824000	7826000	OLR YouTube channel
7826000	7828000	Just saying
7828000	7830000	Although it's not worth it if someone doesn't
7830000	7832000	Make sense of the proper reaction
7832000	7834000	And a random question
7834000	7836000	Will OLR support the DSI with podcasts
7836000	7838000	In AAC format
7838000	7840000	For those too lazy to
7840000	7842000	Lazy to confront them from MP3
7842000	7844000	I'll give you the generic answer
7844000	7846000	Maybe
7846000	7848000	Thank you for your response
7848000	7850000	You're welcome for your response
7850000	7852000	This email brought to you by the Mirror Room from Silent Hill 3
7852000	7854000	With a weird
7854000	7856000	Scrunchy face
7856000	7858000	Last email
7858000	7860000	Mike
7860000	7862000	In Australia again
7862000	7864000	Hey
7864000	7866000	Just wanted to say thank you to Rob
7866000	7868000	And All In Chat a fortnight ago
7868000	7870000	That recommended Chrono Trigger
7870000	7872000	Although it's not a game I generally
7872000	7874000	Would play I got the game on
7874000	7876000	Rob's and the OLR's recommendation
7876000	7878000	And have been really enjoying it
7878000	7880000	Might have to try Super Metroid if Rob picked it as
7880000	7882000	The number one game above Chrono Trigger
7882000	7884000	Hey
7884000	7886000	If there's
7886000	7888000	If there's any
7888000	7890000	Other DS games you can recommend
7890000	7892000	Regardless of type of game
7892000	7894000	I would like to hear your suggestions
7894000	7896000	Hope everyone in the OLR world
7896000	7898000	Is doing well and look forward to getting the podcast
7898000	7900000	Updated soon. Thanks Mike
7900000	7902000	Um

7950000	7952000	Know what the hell's in it right now
7952000	7954000	Let me grab this
7954000	7956000	Monstrosity of a case
7956000	7958000	Right there
7958000	7960000	Uh which of course half of them fell down and
7960000	7962000	Sorry if you hear the random noises
7962000	7964000	I'm trying to fix Justin TV I'm not having much luck
7964000	7966000	Though
7966000	7968000	I think I just lost a game in your couch Rob
7968000	7970000	I think us trying to upgrade
7970000	7972000	The encoder thing
7972000	7974000	Woo hoo! Dan finally did it
7974000	7976000	Broke Justin TV so I don't know
7976000	7978000	With Dan! Dan beat Seth with Dan
7978000	7980000	Nice
7980000	7982000	And of course right as
7982000	7984000	Dan beats the game
7984000	7986000	With Dan
7986000	7988000	I can't get stupid Justin TV to work
7988000	7990000	I'm pissed
7990000	7992000	If I meet someone named Seth I'm just gonna punch him in the face
7992000	7994000	Oh I think I know why
7994000	7996000	Because
7996000	7998000	Well anyway the games that are currently in
7998000	8000000	My um case at this point in time
8000000	8002000	Um and then maybe this will
8002000	8004000	Give you an idea
8004000	8006000	Yes
8006000	8008000	Oh Dan's got a fun ending with Blanca
8008000	8010000	Aka Jimmy and
8010000	8012000	Sakura and Ryu
8012000	8014000	And um
8014000	8016000	Oh my god spoilers
8016000	8018000	I'm not gonna say anything else
8018000	8020000	So the games in my case right now are Final Fantasy 6
8020000	8022000	For Advance
8022000	8024000	Um Polarium
8024000	8026000	Um Trauma Center
8026000	8028000	This is currently in my DS

8030000	8032000	Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, Cooking Mama 1 and 2
8032000	8034000	Um
8034000	8036000	Puyo Puyo Fever
8036000	8038000	Or sorry Puyo Pop Fever
8038000	8040000	Animal Crossing Wild World
8040000	8042000	Otsutataki Oendan
8042000	8044000	And um Doctor Who
8044000	8046000	Top Trumps from um
8046000	8048000	The UK which given that you're in Australia
8048000	8050000	I'm sure that you won't have a problem
8050000	8052000	Getting that so that's what's currently
8052000	8054000	In my uh
8054000	8056000	System right now
8056000	8058000	So maybe that'll give you some ideas
8058000	8060000	Um by the way
8060000	8062000	I want to go back since I was futzing with Justin
8062000	8064000	TV I wanted to kind of correct one thing one listener
8064000	8066000	Was saying and that was about um being able to listen
8066000	8068000	To Orange Lawn's radio on your iPhone
8068000	8070000	Oh here's the other game
8070000	8072000	You actually can listen live you have to use an app like
8072000	8074000	Tuner um tuner is what I use that's a pay
8074000	8076000	App but I know there's a free one as well
8076000	8078000	Out there that you can use to tune in to like
8078000	8080000	All games radio when we're live on Sunday night
8080000	8082000	So you can listen on the phone iPhone
8082000	8084000	Just like you can on the PSP I just wanted to uh
8084000	8086000	Correct that uh the other game that's in here
8086000	8088000	The one that I lost to your couch
8088000	8090000	Yes the world ends with you
8090000	8092000	Oh you don't want to lose I mean you do want to lose that one
8092000	8094000	On my couch no I don't Rob
8094000	8096000	Woohoo
8096000	8098000	Alright
8098000	8100000	So anywho I'm just looking at the new website
8100000	8102000	The OL Army Picks and I finally see the
8102000	8104000	Asakura vs Dan that's not the greatest quality
8104000	8106000	Though if Justin TV stays down
8106000	8108000	We'll try to make a YouTube after the show
8108000	8110000	Um of like a
8110000	8112000	Ten minute review of Street Fighter IV
8112000	8114000	Maybe that can be a fun thing we can do
8114000	8116000	I don't know Loki's trying to work like mad to get Justin TV back up
8116000	8118000	We'll see what happens
8118000	8120000	Anyhow meanwhile if that does it for the mailbag
8120000	8122000	I'm going to say send us more mail
8122000	8124000	Mailbag at Orangelandsradio.com
8124000	8126000	Also if I'm not over
8126000	8128000	This by next week someone else is reading
8128000	8130000	Mailbag
8130000	8132000	Alright we'll see I can always do that I guess
8132000	8134000	If my cold goes away
8134000	8136000	Loki uh we've got some couple more news stories
8136000	8138000	And we're going to open up the skype line at
8138000	8140000	2007 game OLR not just yet almost there
8140000	8142000	Couple more news stories for you guys
8142000	8144000	Yeah
8144000	8146000	Um anyways
8146000	8148000	So there's um an interesting
8148000	8150000	Lawsuit taking place here
8150000	8152000	Or about to take place
8152000	8154000	Apparently Activision is threatening
8154000	8156000	EA with a lawsuit over
8156000	8158000	Brutal Legends
8158000	8160000	And Activision is saying that
8160000	8162000	Um
8162000	8164000	Basically that you know even though they
8164000	8166000	Abandoned the publishing rights
8166000	8168000	You know
8168000	8170000	That somehow they're you know do some money
8170000	8172000	It doesn't make any sense actually
8172000	8174000	If you think about it but um
8174000	8176000	Apparently
8176000	8178000	You know uh you know after the merger
8178000	8180000	With Vinvidi because they were originally going to
8180000	8182000	Purchase or publish Brutal Legends
8182000	8184000	Um you know Activision didn't
8184000	8186000	Bring it on because they wanted to keep their core franchises
8186000	8188000	Like Spyro
8188000	8190000	And Crash
8190000	8192000	God
8192000	8194000	Anyways stuff that they can make you know multiple
8194000	8196000	Um releases for
8196000	8198000	Well EA picked it up and now you know
8198000	8200000	Activision wants money
8200000	8202000	So I don't get how that's possible
8202000	8204000	But okay
8204000	8206000	Um and it's actually funny because um
8206000	8208000	EA had put out a comment too about it
8208000	8210000	As well
8210000	8212000	Regarding the whole Brutal Legends
8212000	8214000	Thing they um attributed
8214000	8216000	To it's like um
8216000	8218000	You know we doubt Activision would try
8218000	8220000	To sue that would be like a husband
8220000	8222000	Abandoning his family and then suing
8222000	8224000	After his wife meets a better looking guy
8224000	8226000	That's the most awesome
8226000	8228000	Comparison I've ever heard but I mean it makes
8228000	8230000	You know what they're saying makes sense it's kind of like
8230000	8232000	Well you guys didn't want to put out this game so
8232000	8234000	We're giving them an outlet and now you're saying
8234000	8236000	No you can't do it
8236000	8238000	It's weird
8238000	8240000	I mean they want money
8240000	8242000	They do but then why won't they just put out the game
8242000	8244000	Because they're afraid of
8244000	8246000	Someone else making money I don't it's weird
8246000	8248000	The whole thing's weird
8248000	8250000	Yeah basically saying that they were still in talks with
8250000	8252000	Them about putting out the game
8252000	8254000	Well too bad or is that
8254000	8256000	One of the things that's like oh well shit
8256000	8258000	If it's going to be such a big deal maybe we should
8258000	8260000	Put out this game after all
8260000	8262000	Well yeah exactly it's like
8262000	8264000	Oh well we were in talks you know but
8264000	8266000	That's like saying you know I was about to buy
8266000	8268000	A car and some guy you know I've been dicking
8268000	8270000	Around oh I'm looking around at some other
8270000	8272000	Things I may buy that car I'll let
8272000	8274000	You know and then some guy comes in and buys a car
8274000	8276000	I'm not going to go sue the guy because
8276000	8278000	He bought my car if you
8278000	8280000	Stop dicking around for it you know and you
8280000	8282000	Didn't think that you thought that Spyro
8282000	8284000	Would do a lot better than this
8284000	8286000	Which I can tell you right now when they
8286000	8288000	Made that announcement originally I was like
8288000	8290000	Are you fucking kidding me that they're going to drop
8290000	8292000	Ghostbusters and
8292000	8294000	You know Brutal Legend because they want
8294000	8296000	Spyro and Crash
8296000	8298000	What?
8298000	8300000	So in other words stop dicking around Activision
8300000	8302000	Stop being retarded
8302000	8304000	You know what big fucking whoop
8304000	8306000	Oh no now you can't sell Brutal Legend
8306000	8308000	You know what it's not going to break you
8308000	8310000	You've got like 50,000 Guitar Hero
8310000	8312000	Games coming out you've got Call of Duty
8312000	8314000	What's your problem you have plenty
8314000	8316000	Of IPs that are coming out that are going to be
8316000	8318000	Successful just get over it
8318000	8320000	Alright our old buddy Bobby wants to make a point here
8320000	8322000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says
8322000	8324000	Activision doesn't want to publish it but they want the money for it
8324000	8326000	Like they got from Atari for Ghostbusters and Riddick
8326000	8328000	Yeah Atari paid Activision
8328000	8330000	For the rights to publish the game
8330000	8332000	EA is not paying Activision to publish Brutal Legend
8332000	8334000	EA is not that beat down yet
8336000	8338000	It'll be interesting to see what comes of this
8338000	8340000	We'll see
8340000	8342000	Sadly the person that's going to get hurt here
8342000	8344000	The folks behind Brutal Legend
8344000	8346000	Including the same gentleman who is responsible for Psychonauts
8346000	8348000	Bummer
8348000	8350000	It'll get published
8350000	8352000	Eventually
8352000	8354000	It was never going to be a big hit
8354000	8356000	I hate to tell you this it's a
8356000	8358000	It's a niche-y title
8358000	8360000	It's not going to sell a gajillion copies
8360000	8362000	Of Activision passed on it
8362000	8364000	But I mean
8364000	8366000	The thing is you got to go
8366000	8368000	You got to go with the
8368000	8370000	Safe titles
8370000	8372000	And then you got to go with the titles that are
8372000	8374000	Going to get you some acclaim
8374000	8376000	And EA is kind of learning that
8376000	8378000	Because they went from doing
8378000	8380000	All the safe bets
8380000	8382000	All the time and everybody was like
8382000	8384000	Fuck EA
8384000	8386000	Their games are horrible
8386000	8388000	I mean what else can they spew out of
8388000	8390000	And crap and then they started bringing out
8390000	8392000	All these great games like
8392000	8394000	Dead Space and Mirrors Edge
8394000	8396000	And
8396000	8398000	These games that have kind of more
8398000	8400000	Limited audiences but
8400000	8402000	You know they're getting EA some
8402000	8404000	Recognition as hey
8404000	8406000	I remember when EA could make a game
8406000	8408000	I freaking sold a copy
8408000	8410000	Of Mirrors Edge last week practically
8410000	8412000	I remember Matt was here last week
8412000	8414000	We played the demo after the show and he totally
8414000	8416000	Was like oh I got to get this game this is awesome
8416000	8418000	I was like I sold a copy of Mirrors Edge
8418000	8420000	Where's my sales money
8420000	8422000	It's a fantastic game and
8422000	8424000	You know they're going to build new
8424000	8426000	Franchises and Activision sold
8426000	8428000	Their future franchises
8428000	8430000	For old tired franchises
8430000	8432000	That
8432000	8434000	Aren't with the developers that made them famous
8434000	8436000	Anymore and are pieces of
8436000	8438000	Crap you know Crash
8438000	8440000	Is done I mean yeah
8440000	8442000	Every Crash game is going to sell
8442000	8444000	250,000 copies
8444000	8446000	Consistent the kids know the brand
8446000	8448000	I sold a Crash game the other day
8448000	8450000	It hurt my heart but you know
8450000	8452000	Crash of the titans
8452000	8454000	Boy that's family entertainment
8454000	8456000	You know but you look at like
8456000	8458000	This Ghostbusters game which has had
8458000	8460000	Screenshots out for like what a year
8460000	8462000	I have demo discs saying that I could get it last
8462000	8464000	October it looked great
8464000	8466000	Then and
8466000	8468000	Atari I think is going to have a
8468000	8470000	Hit on their hands that they need and
8470000	8472000	Maybe they can break out of that
8472000	8474000	You know yeah we make Dragon Ball Z
8474000	8476000	And it keeps us in business
8476000	8478000	That they've been in for the last few years
8478000	8480000	Yeah
8480000	8482000	Black Wolf brings up a good point it still has the
8482000	8484000	Ghostbusters lanyards from PAX
8484000	8486000	All of us that went to Penny Arcade Expo are lanyards
8486000	8488000	Were Ghostbusters games
8488000	8490000	That was like the day before they pulled the plug on it
8490000	8492000	You know and really Activision
8492000	8494000	Just for whatever reason they sent out the nicest
8494000	8496000	Little Ghostbusters pre-sell
8496000	8498000	Kit it came with an Ecto-1
8498000	8500000	License plate that I shanked
8500000	8502000	It came with Ghostbusters lanyards
8502000	8504000	A demo disc a t-shirt
8504000	8506000	I mean it was a nice little kit and the box
8506000	8508000	Looked like a trap
8508000	8510000	And it had like goo
8510000	8512000	Oozing out and it says do not open until
8512000	8514000	October 2008
8514000	8516000	It was pretty sick you know you gotta wonder
8516000	8518000	It's just like why put all that energy into it and then just be like
8518000	8520000	Oh yeah we got Blizzard on our side now
8520000	8522000	F this game
8522000	8524000	I mean Activision published Ghostbusters
8524000	8526000	Back in the day for the NES
8526000	8528000	And the Sega and the Commodore
8528000	8530000	And they figured it would be you know poetic
8530000	8532000	That they're gonna carry it on
8532000	8534000	No not so much
8534000	8536000	We're gonna just let it go
8536000	8538000	It's kinda weird
8538000	8540000	It'll sell it'll be just like
8540000	8542000	Psychonauts where it'll be that game
8542000	8544000	Nobody buys when it comes out except for the enlightened few
8544000	8546000	The unwashed masses
8546000	8548000	Don't understand it won't get it
8548000	8550000	And then it'll be expensive on the secondary market
8550000	8552000	As somebody who wants to be newly hardcore
8552000	8554000	Figures out that it's out there
8554000	8556000	And has to get their hands on it
8556000	8558000	You know
8560000	8562000	It'll be one of those titles
8562000	8564000	Alright
8564000	8566000	Well we got one more news story for you guys
8566000	8568000	And we're gonna open up the skype line
8568000	8570000	Take some quick calls at 1877 game OLR
8570000	8572000	username on skype orange lounge radio
8572000	8574000	And it's about the Beatles game that's coming out later this year
8574000	8576000	This
8576000	8578000	It's not Rock Band Beatles
8578000	8580000	It's just the Beatles that will probably look a lot like
8580000	8582000	Rock Band
8582000	8584000	Well finally we have some insight as to what this game might be like
8584000	8586000	It's from an interview with Entertainment Weekly
8586000	8588000	It's Paul McCartney
8588000	8590000	Actually has talked about the Beatles music game
8590000	8592000	Saying 45 Beatles songs will be in this game
8592000	8594000	From different periods of the Beatles histories
8594000	8596000	Including early days tracks
8596000	8598000	Liverpool, Psychedelic
8598000	8600000	And on from there
8600000	8602000	Because you know McCartney really knows what this game is all about
8602000	8604000	He's probably right down there
8604000	8606000	With the dev team jamming out on the plastic guitar
8606000	8608000	You know what though
8608000	8610000	He probably has him and George Harrison
8610000	8612000	Probably have control and Yoko
8612000	8614000	Has control over everything
8614000	8616000	Oh they got mad control
8616000	8618000	I mean this game like every pixel that goes out on this game
8618000	8620000	Has to be signed off by Yoko Ono
8620000	8622000	Yeah they got mad control
8622000	8624000	I'm sure these are gonna give you you know
8624000	8626000	Deep compelling you know gameplay tidbits
8626000	8628000	You know what though this could be
8628000	8630000	This could be pretty awesome
8630000	8632000	I mean the Beatles
8632000	8634000	Oh this is necessary
8634000	8636000	This is so necessary
8636000	8638000	Next to Rock Band Journey
8638000	8640000	This is the most important title they could possibly do
8640000	8642000	Nope
8642000	8644000	I made a bad faux pas George is the one that's dead
8644000	8646000	I meant Ringo Starr not George Harrison
8646000	8648000	George Harrison has control from hell
8650000	8652000	Ringo's got nothing
8656000	8658000	And actually it's you know
8658000	8660000	Yoko
8660000	8662000	Yoko's got all the power
8662000	8664000	McCartney's got all the money
8664000	8666000	And Ringo's like I was a Beatle once
8666000	8668000	Sorry about that
8668000	8670000	That's alright
8670000	8672000	Your British accent is probably better than mine
8672000	8674000	But anyway yeah
8674000	8676000	This is a game that's very very necessary
8676000	8678000	Because like what
8678000	8680000	There hasn't been a big
8680000	8682000	Beatles thing for this generation
8682000	8684000	You know what I mean
8684000	8686000	These kids today
8686000	8688000	Don't have anything to respect the Beatles with
8688000	8690000	If that makes any sense
8690000	8692000	Well I had a conversation the other day
8692000	8694000	With actually a couple people
8694000	8696000	And over the course of like two weeks
8696000	8698000	I talked to two people about
8698000	8700000	What do the Beatles mean anymore
8700000	8702000	And obviously
8702000	8704000	We're all old enough
8704000	8706000	With probably the exception of my lovely wife
8706000	8708000	Who's you know a young
8708000	8710000	We're all old enough
8710000	8712000	Just giving you some credit there
8712000	8714000	She's 26 doesn't look a day over 22
8716000	8718000	Old enough to realize that
8718000	8720000	The Beatles mean something
8720000	8722000	It's not that we were
8722000	8724000	Listening to the Beatles
8724000	8726000	Avidly you know when we got into
8726000	8728000	Whatever was our popular music
8728000	8730000	But you know we knew that the Beatles
8730000	8732000	Were super important to our parents
8732000	8734000	They were super important to music
8734000	8736000	And everybody we listened to would claim the Beatles as an influence
8736000	8738000	Right it trickled down
8738000	8740000	And we knew that the Beatles were important
8740000	8742000	What do today's
8742000	8744000	Music listeners
8744000	8746000	Today's 14 year old what do they know about the Beatles
8748000	8750000	Pretty much what they hear from the older
8750000	8752000	Generation or just that
8752000	8754000	There's the fashion fad going around again
8754000	8756000	You know they have the
8756000	8758000	You know merchandising happening again
8758000	8760000	I mean but really
8760000	8762000	They
8762000	8764000	This is one thing that I'd actually like to consider
8764000	8766000	Is that our time we don't really know
8766000	8768000	War
8768000	8770000	On the scale of what was going on
8770000	8772000	During that time listen to me
8772000	8774000	We don't know war of that type
8774000	8776000	We don't have people being
8776000	8778000	Drafted and forced to go into a war
8778000	8780000	That they don't believe in
8780000	8782000	We don't have
8782000	8784000	You know being stuck in such
8784000	8786000	And true we do have
8786000	8788000	The religious right trying to
8788000	8790000	Keep us in that phase
8790000	8792000	But we're going from a time of completely
8792000	8794000	Stodgy
8794000	8796000	Everyone's the same into complete
8796000	8798000	Individualism and the you know
8798000	8800000	A massive revolution
8800000	8802000	We're not talking the message
8802000	8804000	We're talking the music and the band
8804000	8806000	The music is the message
8806000	8808000	Just strictly
8808000	8810000	What do kids today know about
8810000	8812000	The Beatles and I'm not trying to diss on the Beatles
8812000	8814000	I'm not trying to diss on today's kids
8814000	8816000	I'm really just trying to make the
8816000	8818000	Point that they're not really
8818000	8820000	So much into
8820000	8822000	The Beatles I mean it's
8822000	8824000	Definitely an example of gaming skewer towards
8824000	8826000	Skewing towards the older demographic but
8826000	8828000	It's like yeah it's gonna bust
8828000	8830000	You know maybe some younger
8830000	8832000	Players some Rockman players into the Beatles
8832000	8834000	But I mean this is a huge deal
8834000	8836000	I mean everyone's making the fucking
8836000	8838000	World of how important this is
8838000	8840000	You can't even get the Beatles on iTunes
8840000	8842000	Cause the control over the library is that tight
8842000	8844000	But what is this really gonna mean to your
8844000	8846000	Average guitar hero Rockman player
8846000	8848000	You can't get it on iTunes
8848000	8850000	Because of the big spat between
8850000	8852000	Apple computer and Apple
8852000	8854000	Core
8854000	8856000	But you know
8856000	8858000	I don't think it's gonna matter cause I think everybody's
8858000	8860000	Parents are gonna buy it I think all these kids
8860000	8862000	I think the parents are all gonna
8862000	8864000	Buy this stuff up and even some of the kids
8864000	8866000	Although I gotta say though a lot of you know
8866000	8868000	You said earlier a lot of the bands we
8868000	8870000	Grew up on were influenced by the Beatles
8870000	8872000	A lot of these bands today I hear in
8872000	8874000	Interviews I've heard a lot of them say they were influenced by
8874000	8876000	David Bowie this is not a bad thing at all
8876000	8878000	So
8878000	8880000	Yeah I'm just you know
8880000	8882000	I'm looking forward to
8882000	8884000	Rockman the Beatles or whatever it's gonna be
8884000	8886000	Except for the fact that
8886000	8888000	They're probably gonna screw us and won't let us
8888000	8890000	Import the music into Rockman 2
8890000	8892000	But I mean come on you know you wanna do it
8892000	8894000	Like the ACDC that would be the only thing
8894000	8896000	That made it worth buying is the fact that
8896000	8898000	I could just dump it all into Rockman you know
8898000	8900000	And add to this stupidly awesome playlist already
8900000	8902000	But I wanna see
8902000	8904000	You know from the standpoint of
8904000	8906000	Of someone who works
8906000	8908000	In the absolute bowels of the
8908000	8910000	Industry I wanna see
8910000	8912000	How this game's gonna sell when it gets to stores
8912000	8914000	Cause there's not really any buzz about it
8914000	8916000	I don't have people standing in line to
8916000	8918000	Reserve the Beatles I don't have people standing in line to
8918000	8920000	Reserve even Guitar Hero Metallica
8920000	8922000	I think the Guitar Hero fad is kinda starting to die
8922000	8924000	Um and I
8924000	8926000	Like I said earlier in the show you know
8926000	8928000	How to run a franchise into the ground I think that
8928000	8930000	I think they're barking up the wrong tree
8930000	8932000	I think this is gonna be the last
8932000	8934000	Ah out there is this Beatles game
8934000	8936000	And then it's gonna be all downhill from there
8936000	8938000	I think this is gonna be the last hurrah
8938000	8940000	Well I just think it's actually
8940000	8942000	Pretty sad that
8942000	8944000	With the current generation
8944000	8946000	Is starting to lose relevance
8946000	8948000	I mean it's
8948000	8950000	Hideous but
8950000	8952000	I mean I understand it but
8952000	8954000	I still think it's horrible
8954000	8956000	Who influenced the Beatles?
8958000	8960000	See that's the thing is it's just the passage
8960000	8962000	Of time we don't know why they
8962000	8964000	Became what they became you know
8964000	8966000	Um and
8966000	8968000	I influenced the Beatles
8968000	8970000	Drugs influenced the Beatles
8970000	8972000	What bands did the Beatles listen to?
8972000	8974000	I mean I know we could go on the internet and look it up
8974000	8976000	And find out but I mean you know it doesn't have
8976000	8978000	The relevance because it's not
8978000	8980000	It's not as important anymore
8980000	8982000	You know we know that all the great bands
8982000	8984000	That we listen to listen to the Beatles when they were growing
8984000	8986000	Up and so we're like man the Beatles must kick ass
8986000	8988000	What did the Beatles listen to?
8988000	8990000	The answer is who cares?
8990000	8992000	It's too far back for a story about your average
8992000	8994000	15 year old player ain't worried about
8994000	8996000	The Beatles hell Guitar Hero Metallica
8996000	8998000	Like I said is not really making as big
8998000	9000000	A deal as I think they need to come up with
9000000	9002000	Something newer and popular
9002000	9004000	And topical that's
9004000	9006000	Gonna get you know the dollars
9006000	9008000	Out of the pockets and
9008000	9010000	So far it's like really I think
9010000	9012000	All of the track packs the
9012000	9014000	Band editions whatever
9014000	9016000	Have been sort of
9016000	9018000	Sort of fail
9018000	9020000	Couple comments from chatroom I gotta read
9020000	9022000	Chat.orangelandrater.com Black Wolf says
9022000	9024000	I don't want it to be something that I can say hey
9024000	9026000	I wish I could just import these into rock band
9026000	9028000	I hope it's different enough to see it on its own
9028000	9030000	Merits rather than just another track pack
9030000	9032000	Sure and that's cool
9032000	9034000	But once you're in a party setting
9034000	9036000	And you wanna play
9036000	9038000	Some Beatles and then you wanna play
9038000	9040000	You know some Casey and the fucking
9040000	9042000	Sunshine band and you wanna play
9042000	9044000	Some Metallica and you wanna play some
9044000	9046000	Who and you wanna play some this and you wanna play
9046000	9048000	Some that you're not gonna bust out the rock
9048000	9050000	Band 2 disc that has 500
9050000	9052000	Songs on it and put in the Beatles
9052000	9054000	Disc that has 40 songs on it
9054000	9056000	To play a couple songs that's gonna sit on the shelf
9056000	9058000	If you're hardcore enough to own it
9058000	9060000	Unless they do a disc swap thing like
9060000	9062000	Singstar does that could happen
9062000	9064000	Still you don't jump up and just go I'm gonna switch
9064000	9066000	Discs yes you're gonna be like
9066000	9068000	Man I'm gonna play some other song
9068000	9070000	We do that with Singstar
9070000	9072000	Singstar's awesome
9072000	9074000	Bullymania in chat says Singstar Abba
9074000	9076000	Went back in time and influenced the Beatles
9076000	9078000	Yes
9078000	9080000	Remember though when we used to play
9080000	9082000	We used to play
9082000	9084000	What the hell game was it
9084000	9086000	No
9086000	9088000	Beatmania when we used to
9088000	9090000	Switch out our Append discs
9090000	9092000	Oh yes the Appends
9092000	9094000	It was kind of a pain in the ass though
9094000	9096000	That was a good point
9096000	9098000	But it was all we had and now there's a better way
9098000	9100000	I will own
9100000	9102000	The Beatles
9102000	9104000	Whether it's the rock band Beatles whether it's what
9104000	9106000	Because I'm of not that generation
9106000	9108000	But the generation after and you know
9108000	9110000	I have the Beatles on my
9110000	9112000	iPod even though I don't own any
9112000	9114000	Vinyl you know
9114000	9116000	I like the music
9116000	9118000	Especially some of the later stuff
9118000	9120000	You know the earlier stuff just doesn't do it for me
9120000	9122000	But it's just like you know they're important
9122000	9124000	You know you should own it
9124000	9126000	If you're into
9126000	9128000	If you're into the niche
9128000	9130000	I mean it's not really even a niche but if you're into the part of the industry
9130000	9132000	Which we are which is music
9132000	9134000	Games
9134000	9136000	If you own Drummania controllers
9136000	9138000	You should probably own this fucking game
9138000	9140000	And if you don't
9140000	9142000	It's gonna depend on how big of a
9142000	9144000	Beatles fan you are
9144000	9146000	Unless they completely bastardize it
9146000	9148000	Which is a possibility sadly
9148000	9150000	Which totally is but I don't
9150000	9152000	I don't really believe that
9152000	9154000	With Yoko having control I don't believe it either
9154000	9156000	Well it's not just Yoko having control
9156000	9158000	Cause take Yoko and John Lennon
9158000	9160000	And the dead Beatles and the living Beatles
9160000	9162000	And all that out of it
9162000	9164000	Harmonix
9164000	9166000	Is gonna have such reverence
9166000	9168000	For the source material
9168000	9170000	That there is no possible way
9170000	9172000	That's true if they fuck it up
9172000	9174000	There will be no forgiveness
9174000	9176000	Yeah exactly if they mess it up
9176000	9178000	There will be pitches
9178000	9180000	There will be torches and pitchforks
9180000	9182000	And people will be dying
9182000	9184000	And I mean well you laugh
9184000	9186000	But that's all there is
9186000	9188000	It's gonna be brutal the fallout
9188000	9190000	Plus you know
9190000	9192000	If you thought the ET game fallout was bad
9192000	9194000	There's money
9194000	9196000	Being thrown at this
9196000	9198000	This is an expensive project
9198000	9200000	This is a
9200000	9202000	This is a deal breaker for harmonix
9202000	9204000	If they mingle this
9204000	9206000	You know it's
9206000	9208000	It's over
9208000	9210000	But act deft has a point harmonix never ever fails to deliver
9210000	9212000	Harmonix has very rarely
9212000	9214000	Failed in any way shape or form
9214000	9216000	Amplitude was a little
9216000	9218000	Disappointing after frequency
9218000	9220000	And I know I'm gonna get some people being like
9220000	9222000	F you pal for that
9222000	9224000	But frequency was just better
9224000	9226000	Alright F you pal
9226000	9228000	We're gonna open it
9228000	9230000	Hey if you wanna tell Dan F you pal to his face

9234000	9236000	Flip me off
9236000	9238000	I'm flipping myself off
9238000	9240000	Amplitude was a great game
9240000	9242000	Our username on skype
9242000	9244000	Is orange lounge radio
9244000	9246000	And you can tell Dan F off right now
9246000	9248000	Let's open up the phones
9248000	9250000	We have a caller on the line
9250000	9252000	Hi who's this?
9252000	9254000	Hi this is Spazinator
9254000	9256000	Just
9256000	9258000	Two or three really
9258000	9260000	Quick things
9260000	9262000	Regarding tonight's show
9262000	9264000	Yes
9264000	9266000	Regarding the whole using
9266000	9268000	Of trained cats for
9268000	9270000	advertising
9270000	9272000	What if something goes
9272000	9274000	Wrong with the cats
9274000	9276000	What if there is like a catastrophe
9278000	9280000	Using I'm sorry using the what?
9280000	9282000	Using the trained cats
9282000	9284000	For the advertisement
9284000	9286000	You mentioned in part A
9286000	9288000	I believe of the show
9288000	9290000	Oh the cats what if something goes wrong
9290000	9292000	What if something goes wrong with the
9292000	9294000	The trained cats
9294000	9296000	That are doing the
9296000	9298000	PETA's gonna write a nasty letter
9298000	9300000	I'm sorry
9300000	9302000	What was that?
9302000	9304000	I said PETA's gonna write a nasty letter
9304000	9306000	For one I don't know I guess I'm assuming
9306000	9308000	These things are under watch I don't think they
9308000	9310000	Just have these kitties all roaming the streets
9310000	9312000	Aimlessly I mean there's gotta be
9312000	9314000	Something where
9314000	9316000	They've got the cats tracked
9316000	9318000	Somehow or the cats are
9318000	9320000	They're being watched
9320000	9322000	Which seems like a lot of fucking
9322000	9324000	Work for a stinking ad campaign
9324000	9326000	But there's gotta be something they're doing
9326000	9328000	No doubt that's easy
9328000	9330000	I don't know if I was like
9330000	9332000	I don't know if I had a mic when you guys were talking
9332000	9334000	Yeah I was playing Street Fighter
9334000	9336000	Yeah that's the worst thing I've ever heard
9336000	9338000	I don't understand what the point is
9338000	9340000	Most people see a cat
9340000	9342000	Running around and they're just like hey it's a cat
9342000	9344000	I suppose if I saw a cat wearing a fear t-shirt
9344000	9346000	I'd be like hey it's a cat wearing a t-shirt
9346000	9348000	But I wouldn't go man
9348000	9350000	Fear I gotta buy that fucking game
9350000	9352000	That gets me in the mode to play some MF in 360
9352000	9354000	BlackWolf in chat wants to point out
9354000	9356000	You can see the leashes in the pictures
9356000	9358000	They're on leashes that's how they got it
9358000	9360000	Cats hate leashes by the way
9360000	9362000	You know those cats are pissed
9362000	9364000	That's a water spitting leash
9364000	9366000	That is right there
9366000	9368000	So what else did you want to call in about Spaznator?
9368000	9370000	Secondly
9370000	9372000	I know that
9372000	9374000	You guys have been complaining about
9374000	9376000	The wind out there in California
9376000	9378000	It could be a whole lot worse
9378000	9380000	I didn't know
9380000	9382000	If you guys have been paying attention
9382000	9384000	To the news
9384000	9386000	Within basketball days
9386000	9388000	But just in my
9388000	9390000	Neck of the woods
9390000	9392000	We just had kind of a semi
9392000	9394000	Major plane crash
9394000	9396000	In Buffalo don't you
9396000	9398000	I just remembered
9398000	9400000	You got this all wrong by the way
9400000	9402000	We probably actually kind of like the wind
9402000	9404000	Because wind is cool
9404000	9406000	We hate the fact that at the sign of a stiff breeze
9406000	9408000	Our internet goes down
9408000	9410000	People forget how to drive
9410000	9412000	And shit starts falling over
9412000	9414000	The storms here are nothing compared to the east coast
9414000	9416000	I'll tell you nothing compared to the east coast
9416000	9418000	We don't have hurricanes here
9418000	9420000	If we had a hurricane here we'd all die
9420000	9422000	We would be dead
9422000	9424000	If we can't deal with the hurricane winds
9424000	9426000	It's because our buildings can't
9426000	9428000	They're built for earthquakes not winds
9428000	9430000	Seriously
9430000	9432000	I swear
9432000	9434000	I really
9434000	9436000	Don't have a problem
9436000	9438000	With driving in wind
9438000	9440000	Because I have driven
9440000	9442000	In heavy wind
9442000	9444000	It's just seeing
9444000	9446000	How many people can
9446000	9448000	People running around with chickens with their heads cut off
9448000	9450000	It's nuts
9450000	9452000	I definitely have seen the news
9452000	9454000	I heard about that plane crash in Buffalo
9454000	9456000	What a tragedy
9456000	9458000	There's really no other word to describe it
9458000	9460000	Nobody was drunk
9460000	9462000	It wasn't carelessness
9462000	9464000	Everything I've heard says it was an ice thing
9464000	9466000	Causing a malfunction
9466000	9468000	It was just a tragedy
9468000	9470000	Very very sad
9470000	9472000	I can just imagine there's just reporters
9472000	9474000	And the media and things swarming
9474000	9476000	All over that town right now
9476000	9478000	Plus everybody having to deal with that
9478000	9480000	It was a flight
9480000	9482000	A lot of people were from Buffalo
9482000	9484000	So it's just very very sad
9484000	9486000	They need one of those pilots
9486000	9488000	Who managed to land a plane in the river
9488000	9490000	And not have anyone get killed on every flight
9490000	9492000	Just some sort of goddamn miracle worker
9492000	9494000	That guy is from California
9494000	9496000	He's from the wonderfully named
9496000	9498000	Town of Danville
9498000	9500000	I remember that
9500000	9502000	I'm really sorry to hear about that
9502000	9504000	You're calling us
9504000	9506000	You must be okay

9588000	9590000	And yes I'm reminded by the chat room
9590000	9592000	That the Hello Kitty Online beta opened yesterday
9592000	9594000	So that's something I might need to check out
9594000	9596000	Hello Kitty Bob
9596000	9598000	There's the MMO you ought to be playing
9600000	9602000	Oh man we got to be all over
9602000	9604000	We need an Orange Lounge clan on the Hello Kitty Online
9604000	9606000	We need to like
9606000	9608000	But we need to be like bad people
9608000	9610000	I don't know how that works
9610000	9612000	All these great companies are going to have a business
9612000	9614000	And Sanrio just keeps plugging along
9614000	9616000	Oh got to love them
9616000	9618000	Hey you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
9618000	9621000	It's Hello Kitty Jason clan member 3000
9621000	9623000	Awesome what's up
9623000	9625000	Do you remember the clan
9625000	9627000	What's up Hello Kitty
9627000	9629000	Kitty klutz clan
9629000	9632000	Are you responsible for what's happening with the black DS
9634000	9636000	Cause I don't think that's right
9636000	9638000	I'm going to back away slowly from these comments
9638000	9640000	Jason please put our show back on track
9640000	9642000	What did you want to talk about tonight
9642000	9644000	That confused me a whole lot but that's okay
9644000	9646000	It's interesting that Dan talks about that pilot
9646000	9648000	That did the water landing being brought up in California
9648000	9650000	Because our news was all over the place
9650000	9652000	Cause he went to school in Colorado
9652000	9654000	There you go see
9654000	9656000	That's why he's good
9656000	9658000	Cause he moved somewhere else and learned something
9660000	9662000	What did you call in to talk about tonight Jason
9662000	9664000	Did people really believe
9664000	9666000	That Nintendo on
9666000	9668000	You mentioned in part A
9668000	9670000	That the whole
9670000	9672000	3D room environment
9672000	9674000	Of the Wii
9674000	9676000	Was still code name the revolution
9676000	9678000	Did people seriously believe
9678000	9680000	You know there was people that believed it
9680000	9682000	And I will even admit
9682000	9684000	There was a period of 5 minutes
9684000	9686000	Where I kind of wished it was true
9686000	9688000	It wasn't true believe
9688000	9690000	Actually there's something really funny
9690000	9692000	You can say about that because the first 5 minutes
9692000	9694000	Of the trailer you can completely believe
9694000	9696000	The first half of that trailer
9696000	9698000	Was beautiful
9698000	9700000	It was amazing
9700000	9702000	But when he
9702000	9704000	We just believed that Nintendo
9704000	9706000	Was going to fuck us up for life
9706000	9708000	That they were going to come up with something that was so
9708000	9710000	Bad ass
9710000	9712000	Like a video game system that you play
9712000	9714000	And it sucks your dick while you're doing it
9714000	9716000	Yes you just couldn't resist
9716000	9718000	It's awesomeness
9718000	9720000	And then they gave us the Wii
9720000	9722000	Because it was supposed to be totally revolutionary
9722000	9724000	That it's like
9724000	9726000	You know you have a system called the revolution
9726000	9728000	It's going to be
9728000	9730000	You know something very awesome
9730000	9732000	But a game system that fucks me while I play it
9732000	9734000	That's revolutionary
9734000	9736000	It was going to be something completely different
9736000	9738000	And instead
9738000	9740000	We got the last generation of console again
9740000	9742000	With
9742000	9744000	A controller that gets
9744000	9746000	Grandmas don't want to play
9746000	9748000	And that's I guess good
9748000	9750000	For everybody
9750000	9752000	Grandma would play a fuck me revolution
9752000	9754000	Who would Konami sue then?
9754000	9756000	Seriously though
9756000	9758000	It's just
9758000	9760000	It's a great console
9760000	9762000	For everybody but gamers
9762000	9764000	Or
9764000	9766000	It's a great console for gamers
9766000	9768000	With really low standards
9768000	9770000	And low self esteem
9770000	9772000	Okay
9772000	9774000	Well yeah
9774000	9776000	Because of course it's low self esteem
9776000	9778000	Because your Nintendo keeps telling you you're fat
9778000	9780000	Nintendo goes you're fat
9780000	9782000	You're ugly
9782000	9784000	Have you ever set that up? Do you half Wii Fit?
9784000	9786000	Yes I do
9786000	9788000	And you make your Mii stand there and he's looking all nice
9788000	9790000	And confident and then you jump on that board
9790000	9792000	And it detects what you weigh
9792000	9794000	And then the guy just sort of slouches
9794000	9796000	And then gets fat
9796000	9798000	And then yeah it starts harassing you
9798000	9800000	I'm sorry this is more accurate for
9800000	9802000	What you are
9802000	9804000	Exactly I played brain age
9804000	9806000	And my DS told me I was stupid
9808000	9810000	You have the brain of an 85 year old Alzheimer's patient
9810000	9812000	Your brain is 65 years old
9812000	9814000	It's tired now
9814000	9816000	You can't understand the word blue
9816000	9818000	Stupid
9818000	9820000	The next time I see Reggie I'm going to punch him in the face
9820000	9822000	Which gets hundreds of thousands
9822000	9824000	Of hits on the entire web
9826000	9828000	So I mean I don't know
9828000	9830000	It's not that what Nintendo's done isn't
9830000	9832000	Quote unquote revolutionary
9832000	9834000	To you know
9834000	9836000	The mass market video game
9836000	9838000	Public who hasn't played a game system
9838000	9840000	Since they played the 2600 from Atari
9840000	9842000	But it's not
9842000	9844000	You know the next generation for gamers
9844000	9846000	And when Nintendo was telling us
9846000	9848000	The Wii is going to mess you up
9848000	9850000	The Wii is going to be something that you will never
9850000	9852000	Expect
9852000	9854000	We're going to redefine video games
9854000	9856000	The Wii is going to take your mother out to date
9856000	9858000	And then sex her
9858000	9860000	The Wii is going to get your mom out the house
9860000	9862000	So that you can have orgasmic video game experiences
9862000	9864000	We were ready for that
9864000	9866000	And what we got was the Wii
9866000	9868000	And so I mean did we believe it?
9868000	9870000	No
9870000	9872000	Did we speculate about it? Sure
9872000	9874000	Instead we've got my mom
9874000	9876000	Who won't get off the fucking TV because she's playing
9876000	9878000	Elibits
9878000	9880000	We didn't know it was going to be
9880000	9882000	The GameCube 2
9884000	9886000	You guys talking about it
9886000	9888000	Just made me think about that trailer
9888000	9890000	The first half of it was great
9890000	9892000	But as soon as it said Nintendo on
9892000	9894000	The music changed and he actually tried to
9894000	9896000	Make up what the system
9896000	9898000	Was going to be
9898000	9900000	If
9900000	9902000	I don't know
9902000	9904000	What to do
9904000	9906000	I don't know how to describe the people that believe
9906000	9908000	The second half of that trailer
9908000	9910000	Mario looked like Luigi for crying out loud
9910000	9912000	Nintendo has never
9912000	9914000	Done that
9914000	9916000	Has never made concept art that looks that bad
9916000	9918000	Mushroom Kingdom was in a forest
9918000	9920000	The video just cut out abruptly
9920000	9922000	And
9922000	9924000	Virtual environments don't exist
9924000	9926000	You don't make games
9926000	9928000	I guess there's RPG Maker but
9928000	9930000	Yeah that made good games
9930000	9932000	Anyways
9932000	9934000	It was Nintendo trying to convince you that the world
9934000	9936000	Was going to change
9936000	9938000	If the fanboys believe it's strong enough it will come
9938000	9940000	Exactly
9940000	9942000	They were going to say look the 360 you think that's great
9942000	9944000	Maybe you see what we got for you
9944000	9946000	That's something that Sony was the master of
9946000	9948000	In the last generation
9948000	9950000	And they used that to bury the Dreamcast
9950000	9952000	Sony was the master
9952000	9954000	In the last generation just like rumble was
9954000	9956000	That's what PlayStation 2 does
9956000	9958000	Because the PlayStation 2 is going to mess you up for life
9958000	9960000	And they were sort of right
9960000	9962000	But they used it to bury the system
9962000	9964000	Nintendo just did the same thing
9964000	9966000	And it worked
9966000	9968000	It fucking worked again
9968000	9970000	From Nintendo, Nintendo watched Sony and just learned
9970000	9972000	They were like look
9972000	9974000	We're going to sit out this generation with this little GameCube
9974000	9976000	And we're going to put out some good games for the hardcore
9976000	9978000	But the next generation, we're going to dominate again
9978000	9980000	And you know what, they did
9980000	9982000	Because that's what Nintendo does
9982000	9984000	They make mistakes
9984000	9986000	And they conquer the god damn world
9986000	9988000	And you know the DS has done it
9988000	9990000	And I remember when the DS came out
9990000	9992000	Everybody was like wow
9992000	9994000	They replaced the GBA with this
9994000	9996000	This thing sucks
9996000	9998000	And look at the DS now
9998000	10000000	It's standard gamer equipment
10000000	10002000	If you don't have one
10002000	10004000	There's something wrong with you
10004000	10006000	And the Wii is kind of the same way
10006000	10008000	Except for the fact that gamers own it
10008000	10010000	Then they look at me and they go
10010000	10012000	What am I going to have to buy for it?
10012000	10014000	And I'm like Mario Kart and Smash Brothers are both worth owning
10014000	10016000	And Zelda's always fun
10016000	10018000	And if you don't own Mario Galaxy
10018000	10020000	You may as well sell your Wii
10020000	10022000	And that's it
10022000	10024000	Oh, Metroid Prime 2
10024000	10026000	That's still at least five games I guess
10026000	10028000	Those are all the Nintendo franchises
10028000	10030000	Well Jason, thank you for the lively discussion
10030000	10032000	And also thank you
10032000	10034000	While I have you on for all the hard work you and Digman did on the new website
10034000	10036000	It looks great
10036000	10038000	And I know the chatters are loving it
10038000	10040000	They're filling it up with articles
10040000	10042000	We're very excited
10042000	10044000	I know what you have to thank me for
10044000	10046000	Dan was the one that carried that whole segment
10046000	10048000	And Digman was the one doing the whole website
10048000	10050000	Practically doing all the website work
10050000	10052000	You were the one calling
10052000	10054000	I know you helped him
10054000	10056000	So thank you for the help
10056000	10058000	I know Digman probably did the biggest chunk of that
10058000	10060000	But he used to get some props
10060000	10062000	Alright well Jason we're going to let you go
10062000	10064000	Because we're going to wrap up the show
10064000	10066000	We've got to get out of here
10066000	10068000	We've got to get out of here
10068000	10070000	Especially if we're going to try and do some stuff with Street Fighter 4
10070000	10072000	I don't know if Justin TV is up again
10072000	10074000	But we'll at least try to get YouTube or something
10074000	10076000	I restart my computer because
10076000	10078000	I figure maybe restarting the computer
10078000	10080000	Will make it work
10080000	10082000	Now my desktop likes to refresh itself
10082000	10084000	Over and over and over
10084000	10086000	And over and over and over
10086000	10088000	My Mac
10088000	10090000	Stopped working after I did an update
10090000	10092000	My laptop is sitting in there
10092000	10094000	I can't do a damn thing with it
10094000	10096000	I restart it and I just get the logo with the little spinning thing
10096000	10098000	And my friends online told me to use the shift
10098000	10100000	Use the S key, it still won't work
10100000	10102000	I'm not worried about that because
10102000	10104000	I haven't really done any actual updates
10104000	10106000	With this in a while so I need to do
10106000	10108000	Service Pack 3 and that kind of stuff
10108000	10110000	But it's just
10110000	10112000	It's still kind of funny
10112000	10114000	Because it's annoying
10114000	10116000	Because all my icons disappear and then they come back
10116000	10118000	And then they disappear and come back
10118000	10120000	And disappear and come back
10120000	10122000	But I'm trying it one last time here
10122000	10124000	And restarting it didn't anything
10124000	10126000	I did search on the problem too
10126000	10128000	And there was some guy that had the problem back in 2007
10128000	10130000	And no one seemed to have an answer
10130000	10132000	Except shut down
10132000	10134000	Flash Media Encoder and restart it
10134000	10136000	I'm like okay I've done that eight times now
10136000	10138000	It doesn't do anything, stupid
10138000	10140000	Alright we'll try to figure out
10140000	10142000	What's going on there but
10142000	10144000	For the meanwhile we are going to get the hell
10144000	10146000	Out of here, we're going to pack it up
10146000	10148000	And get on out because we still have the after birth
10148000	10150000	We got to do too so we got to fly through that
10150000	10152000	And get out of here so
10152000	10154000	Let's go around and first we'll get some last minute stories
10154000	10156000	Before we close up shop
10156000	10158000	Do we have last minute stories tonight?
10158000	10160000	Yes
10160000	10162000	Nice, anything else?
10162000	10164000	Loki do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
10164000	10166000	No I don't have anything ready because I've been trying to get
10166000	10168000	Flash Media Encoder to work
10168000	10170000	Alright wow a night with no last minute stories
10170000	10172000	Then we'll go around and hear everybody's final thoughts
10172000	10174000	Dan thank you so much for being here once again
10174000	10176000	And contributing
10176000	10178000	We always love your
10178000	10180000	Opinions and such
10180000	10182000	Especially being a long time gaming fan
10182000	10184000	Come back again sometime
10184000	10186000	Yeah four or five years maybe
10186000	10188000	Alright
10188000	10190000	Any final thoughts for listeners?
10190000	10192000	Yeah Street Fighter 4
10192000	10194000	Is absolutely legit
10194000	10196000	Although
10196000	10198000	The Xbox controller
10198000	10200000	Is a way of making fighting games
10200000	10202000	It's like
10202000	10204000	Slamming your dick in a door
10204000	10206000	It's just not any fun
10206000	10208000	If you buy Street Fighter 4 for your 360
10208000	10210000	And you're not going to invest in an arcade stick
10210000	10212000	You're high
10212000	10214000	I'm thinking about getting it for PS3
10214000	10216000	Just on the controller alone even though I know more people on 360
10216000	10218000	I don't know
10218000	10220000	Dark Sakura since you're right over there
10220000	10222000	Enjoy the tea and the parting
10222000	10224000	Gifts from me
10224000	10226000	I so will enjoy the tea
10226000	10228000	I might make you save me a bag
10228000	10230000	Which I know is a dumpy thing to do for a gift
10230000	10232000	But I really want to try it
10232000	10234000	Shut up Dan
10234000	10236000	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners?
10236000	10238000	I'm glad I have tomorrow off
10238000	10240000	Because my voice hurts
10240000	10242000	Rub it in why don't you?
10242000	10244000	Loki do you have any final thoughts?
10244000	10246000	No I'm just
10246000	10248000	Pissed off now because explore keeps
10248000	10250000	Crashing and reinstalling
10250000	10252000	I just have to actually go do real
10252000	10254000	Updates because I've been
10254000	10256000	Just letting it do its crappy automatic updates
10256000	10258000	Stuff and you know
10258000	10260000	Whatever
10260000	10262000	And my final thought is I would like to be
10262000	10264000	Over having clogged up sinuses
10264000	10266000	Now
10266000	10268000	Alright there you go just approve it
10268000	10270000	Alright
