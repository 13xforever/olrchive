13885	23160	Tonight, February 22nd, 2009, a new American McGee's Alice is announced, DSi and Rhythm Heaven get release dates, and will we soon be seeing more Red?
32079	37023	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37083	46671	We are that show that broadcasts live every week on allgames.com Sunday nights dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
46751	47732	My name is Rob Roberts.
47772	50995	I'm here with you every week as well as the one and only DarkSakura.
51035	51635	Jamie Summers.
51995	52276	Hack.
52656	53156	How are you doing?
53357	53637	Hack.
53937	55018	Hack, cough, die?
55358	55598	Yes.
56039	59281	Any predictions for tonight's Oscars which we're competing against apparently?
60803	60883	Um...
62728	63008	Fart.
63829	66492	Okay, fart, the motion picture for best picture.
67293	72780	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who's chowing down on a sandwich over there.
72820	73320	How you doing?
73721	74802	It's not a sandwich, it's a burger.
74942	75823	Oh, a burger, sorry.
76384	77405	You guys are making me hungry.
77425	78126	I haven't eaten dinner yet.
78146	78587	I'm doing fine.
79107	79888	Alright, good, good.
80008	81350	Any predictions for tonight's Oscars?
83061	84322	Slumdog Millionaire is going to win.
105558	106318	DarkSakura.com
126132	132035	My gaming week was fantabulously uneventful, but hey, I did actually play stuff.
132676	137539	I played some City of Heroes and more like made a whole bunch of costumes because it was fun.
139680	144563	And I... Actually, Dan and I were watching videos last night comparing the...
145343	146065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
159190	164193	Also, played some more Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game.
166094	173397	I need to actually go back and work on my Symphony of the Night game since I've started it and got, like, to one save point and was like, haha, going to bed.
174678	181641	Also, did some thinking about doing tabletop gaming and then went, meh.
182242	184223	So, that's really about it for my gaming week.
185143	185843	What about you, Loki?
187344	188725	I played Eat the Burger.
190788	192869	No, actually, I played a few things this week.
194390	196452	Mainly Lost and Damned.
197032	202015	I just wanted to add the other the in there.
202415	204357	The new Grand Theft Auto expansion is pretty cool.
204557	206578	It's short.
208522	211503	I don't know, I kind of like the style of it, more gritty.
212343	215524	Some of the things that they've changed are good, some not so good.
215985	218085	Especially with the multiplayer.
218686	221326	For one, the helicopters, they really tweaked.
221547	226388	They gave the helicopters explosive rounds, and they made them fragile.
227028	231010	So you run into one little thing and your helicopter's on fire already.
231350	236052	But, because they have explosive rounds, you can blow up a car and people really quick.
237092	237192	Um...
237737	240259	So that's kind of annoying that they had to go and tweak all that.
240299	253669	They really did the explosive rounds for that Chopper vs. Chopper online mode, which is alright, I guess, but they could have just limited the explosive rounds to that mode instead of fucking everything up.
255723	258005	Then they did some other stuff that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
258045	265730	Now they have different preferences where you have to set your preferences on your phone before you can actually go into an online game.
265770	267391	Say, for example, you're hosting one.
267792	280861	Your preferences for auto-aim, for the cops, and for, well, if you're doing free mode, friendly fire on or off are locked into whatever your preferences are.
281161	284283	and you can't change it on there, which is really retarded.
284323	295530	I understand why they did it for, you know, if you're searching for a game, but as far as hosting the game, you should be able to change those options without having to back out of everything and it's really retarded and caught us off guard with that kind of stuff.
296230	298792	And for free mode, they took out the helicopters.
298992	301513	There's no fucking helicopters for no reason whatsoever.
302114	303935	So that makes no sense at all.
305322	306243	I don't know why they did that.
329059	330099	But other than that, it's pretty fun.
330340	339844	So, you know, what we normally do at lunch, me and my friend, we just kind of shoot each other with the helicopters anyway, so we just play a deathmatch just at free mode, and big deal, it's the same thing.
340584	342065	So, that's fine.
342485	347747	But, you know, the game itself is pretty fun, and we'll be getting into a little bit more of it.
348368	354691	There's some stuff they did for Controversy that I don't get it, and it's stupid, but whatever.
355431	355531	Um...
356786	357427	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
377403	381584	I had store credit, so no actual money was being spent.
382404	391066	And then, other than that, I also played Nobi Nobi Boy, or like I'd refer it to Baby's First Tapeworm.
391606	397928	Basically, this game, I haven't really figured out, I mean, obviously the point is to stretch as far as possible.
398468	400488	I don't know how you do that if you eat things.
401109	406610	From what I found, eating things didn't really seem to do anything, but hey, maybe it does, and I just don't notice it.
407290	420334	But, um, basically you're this kind of weird tube-like creature that looks like it could have been straight out of, you know, um, I don't know, just, um, of course the Katamari universe.
420414	424716	And then everything that's pretty much in this looks like it's straight out of the Katamari universe.
425676	425776	Um.
427216	428737	I don't know, it's a weird game.
429537	433278	You kind of get bored with it after a while, but I've been trying to stretch my character out.
433618	443942	I've gotten to the point where I'm so long that I actually, if I stretch out up or down, it'll go so far that it thinks I've fallen to my death, which, you know, you can't really die in the game.
443962	445642	You just kind of pop back out of your chimney.
446963	450244	But you can eat things, and then you'll poop them out.
451565	454886	And it's funny, because stuff will explode out of your ass.
455802	456743	The auto shotgun's pretty sweet.
482723	484564	But yeah, they took out helicopters out of free mode.
484864	485644	Only free mode, though.
485884	487004	So that doesn't make any sense.
487525	487885	I don't get it.
488065	489265	Comment from Tigerclaw.
489385	490966	So, Noby Noby Boy is like Snake.
491006	492246	You get bigger as you eat stuff.
493787	494707	Well, I don't know if that's the case.
494767	495547	You just stretch.
496167	499868	You have to, like, kind of... Wouldn't stretch imply getting big?
500629	503650	Yes, you stretch by getting bigger, but it's not necessarily eating things.
503750	505070	You basically stretch out.
505150	508151	I don't know if it's eating things that does anything.
508511	510292	I don't even know what the eating things part does.
511260	512141	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
529048	529208	What?
549056	550116	Please explain!
550837	555878	You're a guy standing there and you have to take a shit and you have to not shit your pants.
555918	557018	It's a text adventure game.
557858	560199	And basically you type in what you need him to do.
562320	566541	You have to tell him to take off your pants, pull door to bathroom.
566601	567841	Where did you find this game?
567881	570542	You have him take off his pants before he opens the door to the bathroom.
572186	573387	Have you played this too?
573587	573767	No.
573887	577029	You can do it in any order, but yes, that's what you have to do.
577069	581632	Take out pants, take off pants, pee, go in the bathroom.
581732	585134	But you can like, you know, you can shit on the ground.
585655	590618	The basic object of the game is not to shit your pants, but you can shit on the ground, shit in the toilet.
591598	594080	They have ten different achievements for different things you can do.
596422	597382	It's interesting.
598583	598683	Um.
600319	603901	But yeah, that's pretty much my gaming week.
605942	606262	Awesome.
607443	617788	You know, what is it though with... Did you find this game, because I noticed kind of a theme on PlayStation Network recently that a lot of their big games don't give you much explanation on what the hell to do with them.
618068	621129	No, I didn't know what the hell I was supposed to do with them.
621530	624431	It says there's no objective whatsoever, but...
625927	632732	You see the girl stretching out into space, but you don't see how close she is to another planet or something like that.
633272	636674	Because she's just really fucking far out there.
637274	638255	Has she hit the moon yet?
639336	642558	She's probably gone beyond the moon, but the only planet you can play is Earth.
643878	648401	And you can kind of generate new maps and stuff, but they're all kind of the same.
648441	651503	And I didn't really get it, what I was supposed to be doing.
651543	654185	If I was supposed to be eating stuff or, you know...
655768	657550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
676363	677163	I'll play it during the break.
677463	678844	Alright, alright, I'll have to check it out.
679724	687006	Let's see, I also played a pretty big release on the PlayStation Network this week that also gives you very little explanation on what the hell you're supposed to do.
687066	687807	It's called Flower.
688887	692868	Flower, I'd honestly best describe it, honestly, it's a racing game, in my opinion.
692968	696989	It's a very, very different type of racing game, but it's kind of a racing game.
697069	701771	I don't know, maybe that's not the fairest way to describe it, but you certainly have an acceleration button...
702111	703232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
727409	728169	www.DarkSakura.com
748337	749197	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
773584	774265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
794039	795260	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
811135	811855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
832623	833704	Maybe three, I don't know.
833884	839947	The game does leave some elements to be explored, such as there are secret petals that you can find in stages.
840307	842808	There are secret areas to go in in different stages.
842848	844089	I mean, the game is very open.
844389	848591	It doesn't give you a lot of description as to what you're supposed to do in the game, so there is a lot of exploration.
848631	849451	That's a very big element.
849711	858896	There's really a seventh stage, too, that's the credits, which plays slightly differently, in which when you're exploding the flowers, basically, you're also collecting the letters of the staff in the game.
859136	861038	All in all, I think it's a pretty good game.
874454	883078	Title for download and $10 is a fair price considering it's just the sheer beauty of the game and I think it's something that's very easy to pick up.
883419	886380	You use the X button and you use 6 axis to play the game.
886480	886820	That's it.
887160	892003	You tilt the 6 axis to move which doesn't play as bad as you might think and you use the X to accelerate.
892043	892383	That's it.
892903	894004	That's basically the controls.
894284	897125	as the controls for Flow.
897305	898226	Which was their other game.
898286	899706	The same developers who made Flow.
899726	901267	There's actually a Flow reference in the game.
901707	903648	And one of the trophies you collect is Flow.
904108	905048	A Flow trophy or whatever.
905388	907909	So, yeah, I enjoyed Flower.
908290	908970	I would say pick it up.
909010	913231	I could see that they're probably going to expand this game later on maybe with some extra stages and things.
913652	914472	I think that would be okay.
914812	916733	I do think they need to put a demo out for it.
917273	918034	Thank you for watching!
933664	934404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
955979	957641	Thanks for watching!
972742	978864	But it is difficult, especially with some of those characters that really rely on rolling motions for their moves.
992509	993951	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1012566	1016551	and Arcade Joystick if I'm really going to want to be able to be any good at this game, especially online.
1016852	1024381	When I play characters like Chun-Li, I don't have a problem at all, because most of Chun-Li's moves are back and forth, or up to down, or back to forth.
1025783	1028787	So, that's, you know...
1030322	1032564	That's easy on the Xbox 360 stick.
1032604	1037149	And I'm looking at chat room, chat.orangelaundry.com, and Gunstar in chat says, get an arcade stick, Rob.
1037650	1038691	And I'm thinking... Hey!
1039712	1040713	Is that your husband?
1041013	1041614	I think so.
1041694	1042034	Might be.
1042074	1043035	I know that's the name he'd use.
1044877	1046699	You know, I might need to invest the money to get it.
1046759	1048100	But here's the question.
1048441	1051043	Do I love Street Fighter IV that much?
1053226	1066047	And I, granted, I could get use out of this on other fighting games I play, like Soul Calibur 4 is pretty awesome, and I'm sure they'll be, like, maybe I'll enjoy Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Super Edition High Def a little more if I actually got an arcade stick.
1067728	1069449	But, yeah, I don't know.
1069489	1071630	That's a lot of money to drop on a controller.
1071650	1074451	And I'm just worried I won't be playing this game that long.
1075571	1079173	Some very obvious modes I think were left out of the game, which is a disappointment.
1079253	1086456	I think it's kind of cool that you can turn on the mode where you, like, seek other players while you're playing arcade mode, basically.
1086496	1093799	And you might, like, it gives that old, very old-fashioned feel of somebody walking up to the arcade game and just dropping a quarter in and challenging you.
1094119	1094640	Thanks for watching!
1109682	1116271	Being able to set that to friends only is something I would really think would be an obvious mode they did not choose to enable.
1116571	1121117	Like, I would love to play with that mode on if only my friends could challenge me.
1121177	1124100	Because, you know, and you might be thinking, well, why do you want to set it that way, Rob?
1124141	1124681	Because I...
1125422	1132446	Like to play with friends on Xbox Live more than I do random a-holes that sometimes, you know, I don't really want to play with.
1132806	1134507	And Tiger Glass says I have it turned off.
1134667	1135888	I do most of the time, too.
1136048	1138189	I spend most of my time with it turned off as well.
1139390	1140070	But it would be cool.
1140110	1143612	I'd probably leave it on more often if friends could just walk up and challenge me.
1145939	1146599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1165367	1165987	Thanks for watching!
1183200	1184561	It's a lot of money to pay.
1185402	1187283	And this whole accessibility.
1187383	1190826	I think the game is accessible if you've played Street Fighter 2 before.
1190866	1196470	I know it's been taking a little bit of crap for not being as accessible as they say it is in regards to the difficulty.
1196610	1197611	And I'm not going to lie to you.
1198051	1199592	Seth is a cheap bitch.
1200033	1201734	He sucks, even on easiest mode.
1202214	1202815	Sucks a lot.
1203835	1207018	And some of the opponents start to really suck too when you get up there.
1207078	1208799	Even in medium and some of those other modes.
1210260	1212322	However, what I loved about it
1213360	1216881	Street Fighter 3, Street Fighter Alpha, Capcom SNK
1233167	1250734	Marvel, Capcom you know all those games kind of came out in that Dreamcast era that I kind of didn't play a lot of games through and so for me I didn't play a lot of those games I was able to pick up Street Fighter 4 no problem no problem because the moves are pretty much the same so
1252195	1254996	Yeah, I had a good time with the game.
1255276	1259537	$60 though, that's a lot to ask for somebody that's based on nostalgia only.
1260917	1265018	I would honestly recommend you play it at a friend's house first before you drop that kind of money.
1265718	1273839	If you envision that this is a game you would play online a lot, if you are a fighting game fan at all, then definitely Street Fighter IV needs to be in your collection.
1274319	1277060	But if you're a casual fighting game fan like me...
1277600	1278381	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1308990	1311052	I do have to admit that Gil's a bastard.
1312452	1313433	They're all bastards.
1314153	1315634	Alright, that's going to do it for my gaming week.
1315654	1316555	I don't want to go on forever.
1316835	1318016	We have some news we want to get to tonight.
1318676	1321137	Let's get to some housekeeping.
1321298	1322558	And there isn't a lot right now.
1322598	1328642	I do want to point out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, very cool new feature where our podcasts, when we get them to the feed...
1328982	1330023	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1352660	1352940	I don't know.
1352960	1353901	They said Justin TV was down.
1353921	1354841	I don't know if it came back up.
1355142	1355442	Whatever.
1355902	1359264	But again, remember folks, Justin TV is priority number two.
1359384	1360785	Because we are a radio show.
1360945	1361786	Disconnected again.
1361966	1362226	Weird.
1362646	1364467	We are a radio show, not a TV show.
1364527	1366629	So Justin TV is not priority number one.
1366669	1368350	So it is going to go down occasionally.
1369230	1370731	And that just sucks.
1370811	1372613	So make sure you always tune in at allgames.com.
1373433	1375855	Anyhow, also our LiveJournal community.
1377696	1380258	All the communities are right there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1380298	1386782	If you want to find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners, very cool community, just nice people.

1401852	1411264	OLRPSP.com, it's awesome so check that out I have to ask something and I'm going to actually put this up on our gallery is that your printer?
1412113	1413253	That one on the floor, yes.
1413353	1414934	Your printer looks like an ice chest.
1415514	1416414	It does, doesn't it?
1416634	1420835	I'm putting this up on... Go to our gallery, because we've been putting pictures up on it.
1420875	1422215	I've been taking tons of pictures.
1422675	1425276	So I'm taking a picture of the messy floor.
1425316	1426916	And other people can submit pictures, too.
1426976	1432937	But I swear to God, the first time somebody submits a picture that is inappropriate, we're pulling the plug on that thing.
1432957	1433557	No boobs.
1434017	1434718	Well, no boobs.
1434778	1435718	We should have a special...
1436798	1439781	Actually, I'm okay with boobs as long as they're covered boobs.
1439842	1442525	We do have young kids that look at the website.
1443506	1446970	But dead or alive boobs are fine.
1448031	1451094	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, shall we, Loki?
1451374	1451595	Yes.
1454139	1460403	So there was, of course, the release this week of Lost in Damned, and with it was a little bit of controversy.
1461163	1465625	Starting off, the bit that I don't really get why it was in there, but it was.
1466546	1471909	Apparently there was full frontal male nudity in Lost in Damned.
1471989	1482815	Actually, one of the characters that you talked to, Mr. Stubbs, is in a... I'm sorry, that's just funny right there, that the character's name is Stubby.
1483820	1485801	Mr. Stubbs, yes, he's actually... Is Stubby Chubby?
1486582	1487642	I have not seen the scene.
1487702	1493246	Contrary to what you all might think, I have not went and looked at the scene because I think the whole thing is a little silly.
1494367	1497288	It's just whatever, you know, it's full frontal, whatever.
1498149	1504413	So, yeah, he's there, you know, completely naked because he's in a bathhouse, and...
1505615	1506875	Yeah, he's all hanging out.
1507256	1509376	And everyone's like, oh my god, why'd they do that?
1509696	1510216	And you know what?
1510376	1512197	I have to say, why did they do that?
1512257	1513477	Because here's my thing.
1513838	1518239	If they can put full frontal male nudity in this, why aren't the strippers topless?
1518839	1519759	That's what I want to know.
1519799	1522700	I mean, because that's the lesser of two evils right there.
1522780	1525361	I don't get why that's the case, but whatever.
1525621	1527382	So, yeah, that's in the game.
1527742	1528722	It's really minor.
1529062	1530923	No big deal, but just in case.
1532543	1532903	There you go.
1534064	1542790	Some other stuff that was interesting, there was some censorship tweaks on the European and Australian versions of the game.
1543851	1551357	First off, the European versions, apparently their versions of Grand Theft Auto 4 have been censored with the update.
1552077	1554099	This is, of course, by accident.
1554419	1560063	However, Rockstar is working on it right now so that it will be
1561584	1564025	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
1579164	1582025	And basically, the censorship that's going on, there's no blood pools.
1582926	1594491	The camera, when you get, you know, services from a prostitute, you can normally move the camera around to get better angles and stuff, but in censored versions, it's not.
1596371	1604535	But, apparently, yeah, the Lost and Damned actually reverted the censorship on the Australian version, so that's kind of interesting.
1606775	1608035	Whatever, it's a cock.
1608236	1611937	Obviously, they're just trying to ruffle some feathers with this, and they've succeeded.
1612397	1613398	I mean, whatever.
1613518	1617119	You know, I like, though, that at least it's not, like, sexualized.
1617939	1621561	It's there to accomplish one thing.
1621641	1623141	It's there to get people talking.
1623201	1630984	Well, mission accomplished, because here we are in our little crappy podcast talking about your full frontal male nudity in a game that, you know, is completely random.
1631764	1632305	Just say it.
1632705	1633025	Cock!
1633505	1634786	Exactly, it's just a cock.
1636168	1637549	It shouldn't be that big of a deal.
1637869	1643875	But at the same time, I would not suddenly want there to be random cocks in all my games.
1643915	1644556	You know what I mean?
1646177	1649220	Suddenly it's, oh my god, a cock monster in Final Fantasy.
1649701	1651883	We need more penis in video games.
1651923	1654966	But to be fair, if we're going to have more penis, then we need more vag.
1655706	1657647	I can't talk right now Hi We have Danny
1685117	1685537	Camara?
1686678	1686878	Yes.
1688779	1693481	Rob has salvaged my laptop because I'm actually trying not to move my laptop, so that was me last week.
1693501	1694182	Did Joe say hi?
1695342	1695782	No, I didn't.
1695862	1698824	Hi.
1698864	1701906	But they know you better as DarkTetsuya.
1703626	1704307	Alright, awesome.
1704567	1707228	Welcome, DarkTetsuya, and friends, everybody's here tonight.
1707288	1709630	If my laptop catches on fire, it's Rob's fault.
1709950	1712291	Okay, well it's not my fault, you spilled something on it.
1713214	1716877	You startled me, Rob, with your Rob-ness.
1719379	1720860	It's not my fault if you got excited.
1720880	1722561	Now my laptop smells like Propel.
1722602	1726424	It is not my fault if you got excited at us talking about the story about Cox and Vag, okay?
1727105	1729887	But we need more games like this.
1730047	1730467	I agree.
1730728	1731168	You know what?
1731228	1734951	If they're going to have this game with ultra-violence, then why not ultra-nudity?
1735231	1736612	Well, they have Pacey's.
1736652	1737553	I mean, come on.
1737653	1739674	It's just a little bit more flesh.
1740640	1741180	Who cares?
1741260	1747202	I mean, if you're going to show cock and balls, they can seriously just put boobies in there.
1747242	1748522	I mean, I don't get it.
1749483	1753824	I agree they should be fair and have some boobs in it too, but you know, whatever.
1754244	1754764	Whatever.
1755625	1756605	I just don't even care.
1756645	1758486	I don't know why people care so damn much.
1758666	1763227	I mean, I understand it's because we've never really seen this in a game before, OMG.
1763667	1764587	Someone's got to do it.
1764767	1765288	Whatever.
1765388	1766108	May as well be them.
1766556	1767057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1785572	1787013	Street Fighter 4 Street Fighter 2
1810171	1810911	T-Hawk was awesome.
1810951	1811651	T-Hawk was awesome.
1811691	1812211	T-Hawk was awesome.
1841598	1844541	See, Gunstar agrees with me in chat, because DJ and T-Hawk suck.
1846703	1850285	However, all hope may not be lost for DJ and T-Hawk fans.
1850826	1857591	Yoshinori Ono, who is the producer of Street Fighter IV, has kind of teased the idea of these guys appearing later on.
1857952	1859493	And this was in Famitsu Magazine.
1859813	1862755	He actually said that some 3D models were created.
1862976	1863976	I'd like to see pictures of that.
1863996	1864817	I bet that would be pretty cool.
1865518	1869681	They actually went so far as to actually plan out the combat style for T-Hawk...
1870121	1873045	But they got cut before the game actually came out.
1873386	1878573	However, Ono did say if the fans want it bad enough, the characters could be added at a later date.
1879074	1879795	How would that happen?
1879835	1881537	Could that be download content?
1881577	1883901	Could that be a re-release of the game?
1884401	1885423	I think that's more likely.
1885743	1887744	I actually see download content.
1888344	1892005	And then a gold edition later like how they did with Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
1892145	1894006	Right, but here's the thing with download content.
1894086	1903889	If they didn't already plan for these two guys to be download content, what happens if one of my friends downloads it and has T-Hawk and then fights me online?
1904049	1905090	I don't have T-Hawk.
1905170	1905730	What happens?
1908030	1909351	Because, yeah, Drew, you have a thought?
1910765	1914567	or have a light pack downloaded where you have the characters there you just can't select them
1940396	1947583	You know, kind of like you could get to... What was it they did for Fable 2 where you could go to that area but you didn't have all the stuff that went with it?
1949164	1953528	Can I say something a little controversial about Street Fighter 4?
1953828	1955170	And maybe I'm going to get shit for this.
1955270	1956911	It needs more cock?
1956971	1957272	No, no, no.
1957392	1958873	It's honestly something I noticed.
1958913	1963577	Especially talking about DJ getting cut from the game and all this stuff.
1964659	1966841	Where are the black people in Street Fighter 4?
1967722	1968062	Really?
1968382	1969263	This is an honest question.
1969283	1970004	There's Balrog.
1970104	1970985	Balrog, that's it.
1971505	1973046	One out of... He was for the longest time too.
1973066	1973387	How many?
1973887	1975789	Most everybody in the game is Asian, Rob.
1976329	1979652	But it's like white people beating each other up the game, is what it is.
1979672	1981934	No, it's Asian people beating up the white guys the game.
1981994	1994764	Where's, like, you know, well, I guess you have one Indian guy, too, and, you know, I don't know, it just seemed like these guys, you know, DJ and T-Hawk, T-Hawk especially was a little more ethnic, like, not a type you see in, like, other games, right?
1995765	1997866	Yeah, he's like, um...
1999347	2000448	Yeah.
2000488	2003929	I realize it's a little bit, it's a small world-ish, but what?
2004229	2007330	It's a Japanese anime-ish fighting game.
2007350	2009611	Do you really expect that much racial diversity?
2010331	2011112	I'm just saying.
2011352	2013033	Listen, there was Def Jam.
2013053	2014233	The game's a little white.
2014253	2015714	That's all I'm saying.
2015774	2017434	No, the game's a lot Asian.
2021216	2024737	Listen, okay, you have 50 Cent Blood in the Sand coming out this week.
2024797	2026438	It evens itself out, okay?
2027410	2029771	It's A-Z-N for reals, yo.
2032093	2033313	Chat room, am I wrong?
2033454	2036355	Am I a bad person for thinking this?
2036475	2039117	Tell him he's wrong and he's a bad person for thinking it.
2039137	2042179	Biohaze says black people are non-existent in the Street Fighter universe.
2042199	2042559	That's not true.
2042579	2044940	Balrog is... Yeah, since the beginning.
2045500	2048382	Gunstar says Sagat is kind of like a brother and he kicks ass.
2048862	2049343	He's Thai.
2050350	2053431	and GameGuru says DJ was created by Capcom USA.
2053691	2054351	That's true.
2054411	2055351	That's something I didn't think of.
2055391	2056731	Remember when they did Super Street Fighter?
2057091	2058412	He was the character the USA made.
2058452	2060272	Good observation, GameGuru.
2063093	2065133	UnfoldedRaptor wants to point out there are green people.
2066853	2068494	BioHaze says no more Mexicans.
2068554	2071014	Can we have someone from Central or South America for once?
2071034	2074255	We have Blanca.
2075195	2076075	That's kind of a pity.
2078416	2078696	Anyhow.
2079742	2080142	Jimmy!
2082464	2083585	Rolling and rolling.
2085726	2088949	Go look at Dan's ending for Street Fighter 3, you'll know what I'm talking about.
2088969	2098055	I don't know, and then I could also say, you don't really have a gay fighter either, but then people would say Vega, but Vega's not gay, he's just an asshole.
2098175	2099476	No, I think he's very gay.
2099856	2105080	Here's the thing, he's not gay, he's just queer.
2105760	2106441	There's a difference.
2106886	2116690	I think that Vega, actually I think Vega, well, off camera, really is a major, major crossdresser.
2116790	2117470	A drag queen.
2117891	2118591	Seriously.
2119231	2123053	With all that attention to his face, drag queen.
2124073	2126434	Those shoes, look at the heels on those shoes.
2127134	2127635	Drag queen.
2128035	2129716	Actdeft says he's just metrosexual.
2130076	2130636	Drag queen.
2132930	2133270	DarkSakura.com
2153125	2162472	They're saying that it will not be out for a while, but it's going to be out for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
2166095	2172079	Basically saying that EA is behind it along with American McGee and we should be getting it out.
2172520	2173160	So, yay.
2174822	2176123	And they said it's going to be darker.
2176703	2178324	Yeah, the picture that they... More darker.
2178364	2179125	More darker.
2180310	2184614	The pictures they were teasing it with were like a bunch of snails trying to attack.
2184634	2185355	It's the racing snail.
2186055	2191580	Do you think this could be because... I don't know if you guys know, but there's a new Alice in Wonderland movie coming out next year.
2191881	2192942	It's being done by Tim Burton.
2193462	2194984	And Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter.
2195364	2198367	The guy from Little Britain is Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
2198387	2200409	They have some pretty interesting casting.
2200949	2202831	The big guy from Little Britain is Tweedledee.
2203591	2204452	Tim Burton Movies
2224379	2229320	There's very few Tim Burton movies I don't... There's a man, though, who has gotten too full of himself and too stuck on his style.
2229360	2231181	Well, I don't... Okay, I don't listen to him in interviews.
2231401	2232781	Granted, I don't know the person.
2232861	2233621	I just know his movies.
2233841	2235022	And, you know, I like the movies.
2235942	2237142	At least he's not George Lucas.
2239523	2240863	At least there's always that.
2241863	2250965	Going to chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com VXJasonXV says, I like how Dark Sakura is personifying a made-up character.
2252086	2252706	Hence Vega.
2254430	2257752	DJ Ranma S asks, okay, Sky, would you date Vega?
2258712	2262394	No, but I have dated guys that were that self-centered, just so you know.
2262574	2265035	But no, I would not date Vega, based on previous experience.
2265495	2266036	So there you go.
2266596	2269257	And the City Vampire simply says, Tim Burton needs a haircut.
2270678	2270858	Yeah.
2271486	2272267	That I would agree with.
2272287	2273928	Alright, more gaming news, Loki.
2274188	2274509	Alright.
2275850	2279012	First, a bit of random stuff while you guys were talking.
2279073	2282415	I was trying to figure out exactly what you have to do in Nobi Nobi Boy.
2283997	2285458	Which apparently is eat things.
2286058	2292464	But the other thing I found out is that you can eat a human and an animal or a human and a fruit or something like that.
2292844	2296227	And it will create hybrid creatures when it poops it out.
2298072	2300954	Do you want... You can actually create ManBearPig?
2301815	2302055	Yes.
2302775	2303456	In your anus?
2303716	2304357	In your anus.
2305257	2305577	Nice.
2306038	2306478	Alright.
2307079	2310841	Well, something not quite as exciting as anus ManBearPig.
2312222	2316585	EA has announced a port of Dead Space for the Wii.
2316645	2318267	It's actually Dead Space Extraction.
2318667	2323490	It's going to be an on-rails shooter because obviously the Wii can't really hold up the...
2324751	2347966	graphic detail of the 360 and PS3 versions but it will be kind of I guess a little bit like I guess Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles but you know with Dead Space stuff so new weapons new enemies puzzles co-op multiplayer sounds kind of cool
2348817	2353300	I like light gun shooter games on, uh, you know, I still haven't played the House of the Dead one that just came out.
2353700	2354840	That looked interesting, though.
2355341	2357142	That one didn't just come out, did it?
2357242	2358803	It's been, it was a little while ago, wasn't it?
2358983	2361104	Well, House of the Dead Overkill, that came out a couple weeks ago.
2361384	2362585	Oh, I didn't realize it was so recent.
2362605	2363085	Was there another?
2363465	2365987	Oh, no, it was like a compilation of prior games.
2366007	2366527	Yeah, that's right.
2366547	2368108	That was a year ago.
2368388	2369309	Got it a little mixed up.
2370189	2374411	So, uh, alright, well, you're a fan of rail shooters, DarkSakura.
2374432	2375252	Is this something you might get?
2376072	2376433	I don't know.
2376973	2377033	Eh.
2377912	2378373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2388368	2388688	All righty.
2389249	2393311	Well, hey, moving on to a completely different type of game, Leisure Suit Larry.
2393411	2396033	Remember the old Sierra series, Leisure Suit Larry?
2396393	2400856	You want to talk about the original boobs in video games, you got to go all the way back to Leisure Suit Larry.
2401396	2407480	And, you know, they tried to bring the series back a couple years ago with a game that was kind of, eh, it was like a lukewarm reception game.
2407841	2412384	And so we kind of thought, oh, this series is probably gone and best remembered in our memory.
2412664	2413344	Well, guess what?
2413444	2417427	Apparently, Leisure Suit Larry, Box Office Bust...
2418931	2424459	It was a game that was kind of cut to the side after Activision and Blizzard merged.
2424759	2427924	You might remember people were talking about Ghostbusters and Brutal Legends, some of these games.
2428304	2430107	Not a lot of people were talking about Leisure Suit Larry.
2430567	2431028	Well, um...
2432173	2457963	apparently Codemasters has actually jumped in it's one of their other branches Funsta which is a casual game branch of the company so that's a little interesting in my opinion but they have picked up the publishing rights to the game and the game is going to come out in April it's going to be on the PC, Playstation 3 and 360 and yes it's been rated mature by the ESRB no word if there's cocks um
2458936	2460237	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2476906	2478687	It'll probably be... Let me see.
2479087	2485750	The last game that came out, the casual games that they had in there, they had... I don't know if they had streaking in there.
2485810	2490873	I remember there was quarters, and they had this little... It was fun.
2491273	2497656	It was a little minigame that you had to... You were a little sperm, and you had to dodge... That was the minigame I played at E3 a couple years ago.
2497676	2499397	Yeah, you had to dodge something.
2499517	2500258	I don't remember what it was.
2500398	2500778	Stuff.
2501598	2507483	During the conversation, depending on how well you did, your conversation would be smoother or whatever.
2507543	2509885	You'd talk her out of her clothes.
2510065	2514649	But if you hit stuff, you'd fart or make stupid comments and stuff like that.
2514789	2515470	So it was pretty funny.
2516531	2516851	I don't know.
2516871	2518633	I kind of liked the last game.
2518773	2522296	Yeah, this one, I don't know.
2523103	2525163	I'll check it out, but who knows.
2525423	2526264	Alright, we'll see.
2526984	2528564	More information, I guess, on this to come.
2528604	2531005	Probably a little closer to the release date in April.
2531945	2543127	Well, other stuff that's happening near April is a particular game that was very, very popular on Xbox Live Arcade coming to PC on March 31st, and that would be Braid.
2543987	2548268	And it's getting a price markup to $20.
2549569	2550149	Think it's worth it?
2550949	2551649	Well, it...
2552097	2553338	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2579824	2581966	You said you hadn't played the game, right?
2582126	2582326	Nope.
2582626	2584248	Do you think you might check it out on PC?
2585028	2585228	Nope.
2585749	2586789	Alright.
2586829	2587570	It was worth asking.
2587590	2587630	No!
2589191	2590132	When do I have time?
2590252	2592493	And the chatroom is confirming for me that Braid was 15.
2592573	2594575	You know, it came out a long time ago.
2594615	2594995	I thought it was 10.
2596036	2596516	So sue me.
2598578	2600459	Actdeft begs to differ in our chatroom.
2600479	2602901	Chat.ArmstrongsRadio.com says Braid isn't really worth it.
2603820	2604261	I think it is.
2605724	2607388	It's a very different type of puzzle game.
2607668	2608651	Mario is a puzzle game.
2608731	2611397	It was very entertaining to me.
2611637	2612138	It was alright.
2612860	2613441	I liked it a lot.
2615290	2616931	And yes, I agree with Acidic Vampire.
2616951	2618152	The soundtrack is beautiful.
2618292	2619112	Sorry, I'll stop interrupting.
2619532	2628037	Speaking of the 360, there is more confirmation of a rumored Red Xbox 360 system coming soon.
2628637	2637602	Apparently, the Red Xbox 360 Elite system was mentioned in a Microsoft press release from New Zealand.
2638362	2644746	And it was saying that there was some sort of deal going on where you buy a 360 and get a free copy of
2645146	2653229	Halo Wars, and that the red Xbox 360 Elite console, which is exclusive to EB Games.
2653829	2655970	So I guess it's exclusive to EB Games there.
2657731	2658231	Hmm.
2658931	2661012	Maybe there's a red system coming out.
2661152	2663933	Maybe it's going to come out with Resident Evil.
2665353	2666254	Maybe soon.
2666754	2669475	Maybe they're doing red so that you don't notice the rings.
2669972	2673013	That's the joke I think that has to be made there.
2673213	2674474	The rings blend in with it.
2675114	2678155	Red seems like a really weird color for a video game system, though.
2678195	2678756	Is it just me?
2679796	2682497	Like, I get black, I get white, I get gray.
2682877	2684338	I even get pink for the DS.
2684658	2685779	I actually understand that.
2686159	2686759	But red?
2687159	2688060	It worked for the Virtual Boy.
2688220	2689160	Oh, sorry.
2689340	2689920	Oh, no, it didn't.
2692321	2694402	You saw nothing but red on the Virtual Boy.
2694422	2694942	Yeah.
2696463	2696884	I don't know.
2696944	2701508	I mean, I could see them putting something like this out for a limited time or something.
2701748	2703730	People might buy it.
2704091	2707614	Even the Xbox being green, that made sense, actually.
2707894	2712899	I have the Xbox that was green, the Halo one, not the regular black one.
2712999	2713920	But yeah, I don't know.
2713980	2715482	Red seems like a strange color, though.
2715822	2716343	But okay.
2716563	2717083	I mean, whatever.
2717464	2720046	Maybe I'm just saying that because I know it would totally clash in my house.
2722268	2732573	I'm sure if this were to actually exist, that they're going to be probably making an announcement very soon on it, since Resident Evil comes out in a few weeks.
2732773	2739317	I mean, just assuming that it's actually going to be coming out with Resident Evil, not that I would know or anything, but I'm just saying, it's got to be soon.
2739617	2748582	Hypothetically, I mean, that something like this would be coming out with Resident Evil, we'd have to know about it very soon, since that's only a few weeks away.
2750011	2750852	Hypothetically speaking.
2750872	2752153	Well, evening in Japan?
2766929	2767489	Dead Rising 2
2796058	2799180	I mean, because we've kind of had the hype for it the past week and it's been confirmed.
2799340	2800761	Is it really that big of a secret?
2801561	2803822	Or do we really think something new is going to come out of this?
2803842	2806464	Because when I read this, I was like, it's just going to be Dead Rising 2.
2806544	2808725	Or it could be something lame like Sheep.
2811086	2812527	Was Capcom making the Sheep game?
2813007	2814389	Yeah, they're publishing it.
2815430	2816851	They should do Black Sheep, the game.
2817472	2819354	Captain Commando HD Remix.
2819594	2822277	They are 17 hours ahead, so they are about noon.
2822317	2823519	It's about noon in Japan right now.
2824620	2825501	We'll see more in a little while.
2825641	2829325	I, for one, support the Captain Commando HD Remix.
2829706	2830186	You think?
2830887	2834211	Dude, I dumped so many quarters in that game, it's not even funny.
2835731	2836431	Maybe Mega Man 10.
2837312	2838052	I somehow doubt it.
2838152	2838912	How about Area 50?
2838952	2839453	What was that game?
2839473	2840073	UN Squadron on Xbox Live.
2840093	2840593	That would be awesome.
2840613	2840953	UN Squadron.
2855076	2860540	I have to interject.
2861101	2863102	I've gotten the best reaction out of Drew ever.
2863322	2863542	What?
2864023	2873711	I've shown him a copy of the Amazon page for the book I'm going to be ordering, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the classic Regency romance now with ultra-violent zombie mayhem.
2874852	2876953	That would kind of tie into the whole Dead Rising thing.
2877333	2877714	Yes.
2877754	2878234	Yes, I know.
2878254	2878454	I wish.
2886011	2887352	Dream on, I hate to say it.
2887932	2888292	We'll see.
2888692	2891373	Alright, let's travel the world and look at some release dates that we actually know about.
2891393	2894273	Or another Monster Hunter game, because they like making Monster Hunter.
2895514	2899415	That would make sense for Japan, too.
2899435	2902075	They didn't advertise that the trailer was going to be here, right?
2903516	2903816	We'll see.
2904096	2906477	Alright, let's travel the world and look at some of the release dates that we know about.
2906497	2907977	We'll start off in Europe, DarkSakura.
2908390	2913654	Well, coming out for the gaming systems and PCs and stuff in Europe.
2914054	2933910	On the 27th, we have Castlevania Judgment on Wii, Cryostasis for PC, Dead Rising Chop Till You Drop on Wii, Family Ski and Snowboard on Wii, Halo Wars for Xbox 360, Killzone 2 for PlayStation 3, Men of War on PC, Necrovision on PC, um...
2935872	2939799	Onei Chambara, Bikini Samurai Squad, and Bikini Zombie Slayers.
2940420	2942163	First for 360, second for Wii.
2942804	2947291	Silent Hill Homecoming on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.
2947792	2949695	And Ultimate Band on DS and Wii.
2953045	2953446	The end.
2967728	2969810	And remember, Flock was a sheep one by Capcom.
2970251	2971111	Boring!
2971251	2973814	I don't think that's that, but, you know, you never know.
2974455	2977297	Anyways, next week's actually pretty exciting for game releases.
2977317	2983323	There's some pretty good stuff coming out, including Star Ocean Last Hope on Xbox 360, which should be pretty epic.
2983884	2984825	Pretty good reviews so far.
2985505	2988088	50 Cent Blood on the Sand on PS3 and Xbox 360.
2988168	2988428	Hell yes!
2991625	3009571	Shellshock 2 Blood Trails on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC Legacy of Ys Book 1 and 2 on DS Puzzle Quest Galactrix on DS Dead Rising Chop Till You Drop on the Wii
3011259	3012801	Stoked on Xbox 360.
3013161	3015083	It's a pretty fun snowboarding game.
3015923	3018565	Imagine Ice Champions on DS.
3020027	3022949	Supposedly, EAT led the return of Matt Hazard.
3023189	3029554	I hope that comes out that week, because I thought it was the week after, but you never know.
3029915	3030615	Let's see.
3031716	3033598	Killzone 2 on PS3.
3035099	3036220	Peggle on DS.
3038361	3038462	Um...
3039690	3046128	My Personal Diary on DS, Puzzle Challenges and more on Wii.
3047941	3051064	UnfoldedRaptor in chat says, Blood on the sand is going to be game of the year.
3051124	3051684	Just watch.
3052345	3054566	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com live on Sunday nights.
3055467	3057289	I'm tempted to buy it just to see.
3058009	3060992	There's a part of me that wants to buy it, but it's probably going to be $60, right?
3061652	3062053	It is going to be $60.
3062733	3063234	Don't buy it.
3063554	3065575	I'll wait for it to hit the bargain bin.
3065595	3067497	Dude, do you know what I saw at Best Buy the other day?
3067617	3069499	A Rock Revolution bundle for $30.
3070700	3071921	That's drums and game.
3072141	3075664	Yeah, I think that's just slightly under what they normally cost now.
3076855	3078196	I mean, it's that bad.
3078736	3081238	I thought about it, because you can use the drums with other games, right?
3081818	3083459	Yeah, but they suck that bad.
3083479	3084140	Oh, okay.
3084640	3091184	But, I mean, hey, if you want, get the game for the download content, because they have some of the Guitar Freak stuff in there.
3091565	3092445	Ah, that's a good reason.
3093566	3093986	Think about it.
3094847	3095287	Yeah, I don't know.
3097168	3099009	Samurai Dough 3 Samurai Dough 3
3126956	3129397	and Rainbow Six Vegas 2 also gets a price reduction.
3129437	3131298	So it's a good week for some sales over there in Japan.
3131718	3135900	Moving on to the PlayStation 3, NBA Live gets a price reduction.
3136260	3142583	Otherwise, as far as a new game goes, Ryu Ga Gotoku comes out, number three in the series.
3143163	3145144	I'm not sure what this is.
3145264	3147045	It's Yakuza 3.
3147885	3148666	It's just Yakuza 3?
3149106	3149666	Yeah.
3149946	3150406	Oh, okay.
3151467	3154328	Looks like you can get some romance on in this one.
3154828	3156049	We'll get some screenshots from that.
3156732	3157752	If they have chicks, you can pick up.
3180720	3181861	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3206636	3208337	I know there's some King of Fighter fans in the house.
3209597	3213979	And on the Nintendo DS, kind of a range of games.
3214079	3219921	Dragon Dance, Game Center CX, Arino no Chosenju comes out as well.
3220341	3223242	A voice chat DS application comes out as well.
3223782	3232365	As Kameko Deluxe DS, Yome Tomeka to Otoko to Ona comes out.
3232565	3233446	And that is...
3234426	3237951	Looks like a little girly adventure game, but there's bowling in it.
3238993	3243420	I don't know if it's like a mini game collection or what, but there's like a little bowling mini game in that.
3244121	3245503	Probably not something we're going to get over here.
3246366	3258975	And lastly, on the PSP, again, in Japan, because sometimes they get stuff before we do, you get a port of Dragon Dance, and Common No Maid Guy, Boyoyan Battle Royale comes out.
3259756	3268442	It's an adventure game, not to be confused with the Battle Royale movie that we all know and love, but it does have girls in schoolgirl outfits, and it looks like they're fighting each other.
3268462	3269383	It's based off the manga series.
3269623	3269843	Is it?
3271044	3272345	And they attack each other with brooms.
3274540	3276081	Is this like maids fighting each other?
3276101	3276661	That's what it looks like.
3276681	3279022	I don't know what it... Yeah, it's in the title.
3279462	3280382	Common, no maid.
3280722	3287945	Maid games are like... Anything maids are like major, major big fetish deals, so... Well, there you have it.
3288005	3290005	So you fetish fans, get that on PSP.
3290405	3293326	Also, your memories off, girl style.
3294707	3296287	At least that wasn't called your panties off.
3296307	3298768	Wow, that's an adventure game.
3298808	3300369	If it was, that'd be an instant purchase.
3302219	3304761	You might want to go women's style, not girls' style for that.
3305121	3310425	And then lastly, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade comes out on the PSP.
3310485	3319612	That's an action game that looks a little Final Fantasy-ish, but with some live-action elements in it, it looks like.
3319712	3322274	So check that out on PSP if you're in Japan.
3323237	3323657	There you have it.
3323677	3324658	That does it for your PSP release date.
3324678	3329663	Or if you want to get it for your friends in America who do a show for you every Sunday.
3330244	3333587	And DJ Ranma S in chatroom says, yes, maid games do sell.
3333988	3336290	I know I sell a lot of hentai maid games.
3336871	3337551	Congratulations.
3339053	3342476	Well, how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with maids?
3342917	3343357	Yes, please.
3344038	3344738	Bobsleds!
3345980	3347101	How about maid in a bobsled?
3348382	3353387	You know there is someone out there who has a fetish for maids on bobsleds.
3354488	3354928	But no.
3355088	3356510	If so, this show's for you.
3356910	3360533	This is high speed bobsled racing from Sega.
3361414	3363496	God, Sega, why do you do this to me?
3364217	3369523	It's called Storm G and it's a deluxe cabinet set where they've got them all lined up.
3371946	3378293	And it's supposed to have you bobsledding in rocket-powered blobs, blobs, bobsleds.
3380712	3381292	Boob sledding?
3381853	3382153	Okay.
3382893	3385174	Each sled, though... That would be cold!
3386095	3386995	Too cold!
3388856	3397380	Each sled, though, accommodates two people, and it has twin joysticks, and each person controls different aspects... Boobs and twin joysticks.
3399121	3406305	Each joystick controls different aspects of it to do 360-degree rotation and increase your speed.
3408176	3409997	I think the maid fans would like this game.
3410037	3410977	It sounds pretty hot.
3413137	3417158	At any rate, it's like a 10 minute game and you pay about 650 to play at 600 yen.
3418218	3420939	And it's already at the Joyopolis in March.
3424060	3429701	For any of our Japanese listeners, go there and take pictures of it and get signs of it in play.
3430221	3432101	We really, really want to see what it's like.
3432241	3435262	Have fun boob sledding with your twin joysticks at Joyopolis.
3437213	3437574	and DarkSakura.
3442697	3459631	Well, if Rocket Bob Sledding isn't for you, there are some other games coming out as well that are equally epic, including the brand new game running on Sega's new hardware, Ring Edge, and the game's called Border Break.
3459871	3468018	You may remember it as, well, it's sort of like Virtual Lawn, actually, but played a little bit more linear, kind of like Armored Core.
3468559	3471101	So it's a mech action fighting game.
3472233	3474114	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3503053	3504257	Got two out of four right.
3507079	3511742	Well, there is a little twist to this because I don't actually... I'm not pooping money.
3512663	3516145	I actually would be buying these new toys that are coming out.
3517026	3521409	It's coming out from... Organic is the name of the toy maker.
3521849	3529855	They are taking classic Sega arcade cabinets and shrinking them down to like four inches in length.
3530275	3533798	And those are the four cabinets they're going to be releasing as these little figurine toys.
3533818	3535759	These are like little gachapon, basically.
3536140	3536340	Yeah.
3537100	3538722	But the capsule game stuff.
3539242	3542605	Well, no, they're actual arcade cabinet.
3542845	3544646	Like they're toys that look like the little cabinets.
3544666	3545687	That's what I'm saying.
3545727	3548229	They're little capsule toys.
3548269	3550931	You buy the box and you get a random one out of each box.
3551572	3552052	Probably.
3552392	3555715	It doesn't say if they're actual capsule toys or what the thing is going on.
3556576	3557937	But I don't think they're playable.
3558217	3558818	That's for sure.
3558838	3559098	No.
3560155	3563397	But those little things, those are very, very, very popular.
3563558	3568301	I mean, getting all the various character and goods that come up.
3568321	3573585	Capcom's actually got a series of little figures for some of the female characters.
3573825	3577888	By the way, there is a fifth cabinet that's a secret, according to the website.
3577908	3578968	Secret my ass.
3579549	3580269	You know what that is?
3580389	3580609	What?
3581090	3586093	I think it's a... Well, no, it can't be a... Could it be Afterburner?
3586353	3588535	It can't be an Afterburner, because Afterburner is a closed machine.
3589789	3591170	Oh, yeah, because it went a little high.
3591190	3591851	I don't know.
3592152	3597097	Well, actually, no, I think it might be an afterburner if they had the cover off of it.
3597117	3598198	Maybe it's a House of the Dead.
3598679	3598879	No?
3599059	3599440	No.
3599980	3601201	No, I don't think you sat down with that one.
3601542	3604165	Well, these are all classic cabinets, so it can't be... Space Harrier?
3604445	3606467	It can't be the... There you go, Space Harrier.
3606487	3607028	All right.
3607887	3608627	Well, no, you know what?
3608707	3617031	Honestly, I think it is an afterburner because Space Harrier, if I'm right, had the closed top, too, and this figure doesn't.
3617171	3620092	Yeah, it just kind of makes sense, too, with the other games.
3620152	3620612	It would fit in.
3621092	3621393	We'll see.
3621613	3623293	We'll probably see when these things come out in the future weeks.
3623313	3625234	No, it's one of those Sega 360 machines.
3627375	3628776	Yeah, I don't know about some of these.
3629216	3630776	Acidic Vampire says, WTF?
3630816	3632197	I can't play it if it's four inches.
3632917	3635338	Game Guru says, next up, a miniature Mega Drive.
3636379	3636719	Who knows?
3637708	3638388	Metal Gear Movie
3665034	3669558	And you know how pissed off I was that they were taking my man off of it.
3669978	3670779	Well, guess what?
3671219	3671879	And your man is?
3672180	3672740	David Hader.
3673741	3674401	He's back on.
3674922	3680807	Well, he didn't come right out and say it, but he danced around saying everything, but yes, I'm back.
3681927	3690854	So, at an interview, and actually, I'm going to go ahead and actually post a link up to the article, because there's a copy of the interview on there.
3691155	3691855	It's on Kotaku.
3693016	3700158	But in an interview he was basically saying that there's a possibility of involvement in being back on it instead of just saying no.
3700958	3703219	So I'll be posting that in the chat room so everyone can watch the interview.
3704539	3704959	It's cool.
3705079	3705659	Makes me happy.
3706620	3707140	Very cool.
3707380	3708360	I know you love David Hayter.
3708640	3709440	Oh, hell yeah.
3709460	3711441	I mean, he gave us the first X-Men movie.
3712001	3714482	And he's the voice of Solid Snake, so it makes sense.
3715082	3716202	He should just play Snake.
3717742	3726885	Well, another movie that may have been at one time, but I don't think it's coming out anytime soon, if at all, Mega Man, the movie.
3726965	3736488	Apparently, Warner Brothers, at one time, was trying to acquire the rights for the Mega Man series to turn it into a feature film.
3736568	3737689	God, no, please don't.
3737789	3738929	You know this would be terrible.
3739949	3743711	It would be absolute shit if they were to do this as a movie, unless it was animated.
3745071	3747372	You could not do a live-action Mega Man movie, I'm sorry.
3747472	3760255	Yeah, Capcom, the creators, are wary, letting anyone touch the project after a few disastrous licensing moves with the property as well as the recent so-so reaction to other movie adaptions.
3760715	3763816	The most recent movie made that the suits...
3767118	3778552	The most recent move made was that the suits asked Capcom for a wish list of directors, and Shyamalan, that's right, as in M. Night Shyamalan, was one of the names they came back with.
3780714	3782715	You know, here's the thing.
3782955	3785176	M. Night Shyamalan movies have gotten progressively worse, too.
3785196	3786336	Yeah, but here's the thing, though.
3786677	3788718	He's trying to break out from doing... I did like The Village.
3789438	3790678	Well, okay, okay.
3791119	3794460	Enough of the actual M. Night Shyamalan movies that he writes and stuff like that.
3795260	3803784	He's actually trying to break out from doing those types of movies, and that's why he's doing the live-action Avatar movie, which is based off the Nickelodeon animated series.
3804284	3807846	So, if that turns out okay, then maybe he can...
3808426	3810387	GameGuru in chat says Avatar the movie will flop
3832566	3833887	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3857236	3866798	Now, granted, a lot of it is still just palette swapping, but they've actually been able to insert some cutscenes into it that fit with the Final Fantasy X story.
3867318	3871499	The water scene between Tidus and Yuna is in there, which is kind of interesting.
3871539	3873219	And look at that title screen just alone.
3873259	3878180	It's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe they actually worked that into an 8-bit cartridge.
3879881	3881161	That's very impressive.
3881181	3881261	Yeah.
3881772	3885633	Yeah, but seriously, you've got a lot of time on your hands if you're doing that kind of detail.
3885733	3887974	Seriously, I'm actually going to play through this.
3889334	3889755	Totally.
3889895	3893276	Looks better than that Chinese Final Fantasy VII that was out a little while ago.
3893476	3896097	Yeah, it does look a lot better than the Final Fantasy VII, I'll give you that.
3896657	3897557	Looks a lot better than that.
3898277	3900798	Yeah, in GameGuru it says, wasn't there a Final Fantasy VII NES ROM hack?
3900818	3901418	Yes, there was.
3901878	3903399	So, there you go.
3904930	3908971	Alright, so let's move into the classic video game of the week.
3908991	3916933	You know, every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, we tell you guys, go into your classic archives and find an old game to pay some respect to.
3917313	3923274	And DarkSakura digs through her own huge archive of games.
3923354	3925295	You told me how many systems, you and Dan counted, right?
3925805	3928466	I think we came up to 30 to 32, something like that.
3928626	3929026	Systems?
3929187	3929487	Yeah.
3929907	3930427	That's crazy.
3930927	3932608	So you've dug through all those archives.
3932688	3937030	That's non-import, non-duplicate systems.
3937250	3937590	Wow.
3938211	3938751	That's crazy.
3938951	3940332	With the imports, we get up to 40.
3940372	3941592	40-ish.
3941812	3942372	Oh my gosh.
3942613	3943633	But you still don't have a Pippin.
3944293	3944814	What's up with that?
3944914	3945434	I'm just kidding.
3945954	3953200	Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and look at the classic video game of the week, which if I'm not mistaken is pretty topical this week, right DarkSakura?
3953340	3958624	But before we say the name, you've got to play the music because I know people are going to get it right away.
3959044	3960966	Okay, then let me fire up the music here.
3960986	3963608	Here's a return of video game music to you.
3971784	3973305	Okay, now we all get it, don't we?
3973325	3974606	Oh, it's the Puzzle Fighter theme.
3975186	3976006	Bite my butt.
3977427	3981369	The game is Street Fighter Alpha 2 or Street Fighter Zero 2.
3981970	3987773	And I don't mention the first one because as awesome as the first one was, the second one was the best.
3994917	3996438	The first game is no longer canon.
3996778	3998839	The second game replaced the first game's storyline.
4000325	4000985	Yeah, what he said.
4001405	4013807	So, Street Fighter Alpha 2 basically was the game that gave us the annoying things called Alpha Counters, which I actually kind of like, but I hate doing them by accident.
4015068	4019928	We have the three-level super combo gauge, air blocking, and fall breaking.
4020668	4028670	And thank God we didn't get parrying in that one, like in Street Fighter 3, because parrying while cool was a pain in the ass.
4030211	4043852	Um, so basically, it's, uh, and I honestly think this is pretty much the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series, because Alpha 3 was kind of ass, except for some of the characters in it, and I hated the A-ism, B-ism, I hated taking all that shit.
4045514	4058266	So, anyway, this also had Akuma as a regular character, or as he was in the Japanese version, Golki, which I think is a better name, especially if you consider the current storyline that it was Golki versus Golken.
4058847	4064452	So, anyway, so you actually got Shin Akuma as your secret opponent.
4065092	4070658	Everyone brought in the rival thing, which I was really glad they put that in Street Fighter IV, the whole...
4071398	4075324	And then, um, you also, um, have, uh, Instantly Selectable, you have Bison, um, who was...
4087440	4091642	Vega in the Japanese version, Akuma and Dan.
4092343	4095224	You also got three characters who are returning from other games.
4096785	4102768	You've got Zangief and Dhalsim, and then you got Gen, who was from the first Street Fighter game.
4103208	4111232	You also got Rolento from Final Fight, and Sakura, who was the first original new character for that series, and I thought it was really cool.
4111292	4114173	Well, even for the second one that came out, for Alpha 2.
4115554	4115794	Anyway,
4118046	4122332	I was very happy though when they started bringing in the Final Fight characters because I freaking love Final Fight.
4122452	4126719	I've been collecting every version of Final Fight, except for the American-made crap versions.
4130605	4132187	Didn't Dan count as an original character as well?
4133522	4160824	on top of that, for anyone who doesn't know he's totally a parody of Art of Fighting because Rio and Robert Garcia were combined to make Dan, he was a big joke however, if you can beat the game with him mad props to you if you can beat Puzzle Fighter with him, mad props to you so Drew says real men play Dan
4162204	4166748	Anyway, so you've got all your characters.
4166808	4170191	You have, you know, basically different versions of them.
4170251	4172653	You've got arcade versions on the consoles.
4173514	4178719	Now, this is going to be me bitching for just a moment.
4180600	4186245	The Super NES... Well, the other two ran out.
4187346	4187987	I like Chun-Li.
4189341	4191462	This is a game where I decided that Chun-Li is a bitch.
4192682	4200885	Anyway, there was a Super Nintendo version of this released in 96.
4202445	4208007	I had this for a while before it was removed from my possession without me knowing.
4208027	4208087	Die.
4211689	4217092	It was the version that made use of the SDD-1 chip for graphic decompression.
4218472	4220814	So guess what it put into a cartridge game?
4221534	4222155	Load time.
4223326	4230333	It had, now loading, in a freaking SNES cartridge, it had to decompress and load.
4230714	4233657	And I'm like, damn, this is slow.
4235559	4240544	There was also a PC version that was based off the PlayStation version.
4243447	4246029	It was okay, I actually have that somewhere in my house.
4247010	4253914	Um, there was the home versions that came out of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, um, which in Japan came out of Street Fighter Zero 2 Dash.
4255254	4260117	And, um, it was also part of the Street Fighter collection that was a big compilation.
4261117	4271003	Um, and then there was, um, the, uh, in the Gold version it had Kami based on her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance.
4271023	4271723	Um.
4272283	4292580	and it was she was actually a hidden character character that was selectable in the versus and training modes so that was pretty cool also on PlayStation 2 we got Street Fighter Alpha Anthology which is more like the arcade version of the game it was pretty cool
4293800	4298003	I've actually got both the Saturn and the PlayStation versions.
4298103	4300204	And the Saturn version, way better.
4300504	4301425	Way better.
4301585	4305087	It's far better than the PlayStation version was.
4305207	4309569	Actually, anything 2D, practically, the Saturn version is going to be better.
4309850	4317734	Better colors, better... It can handle 2D graphics and sound so much better than the PlayStation version.
4318575	4319095	At any rate...
4321076	4332819	They actually... In 1996, Dan won number one video game character, and Sakura won number three video game character, which I thought was funny.
4332859	4338700	That was actually in Gamest Magazine, which is a Japanese magazine.
4339160	4344722	Got best fighting game, number nine best in graphics, number six best direction, number four best video game music.
4344822	4345682	So that's pretty cool.
4346922	4347082	And...
4350103	4372976	it's seriously oh you got roses roses in Street Fighter 4 I thought it was cool yep um but it's it's just a really it to me it is the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series I mean I love Street Fighter 4 and I actually I like Street Fighter 3 for just playing as Ibuki um but other than that I mean Street Fighter Alpha 2 is like the top of it for me it does not get better than that
4373576	4375057	Alright, well there you have it.
4375497	4378559	Your classic video game of the week, Street Fighter Alpha 2.
4379359	4383122	A very good topical pick, considering the game that's on everybody's mind this week.
4383182	4391927	We have to take a minute to respect the classics that help inspire some of the appearances you see in Street Fighter 4, such as Rose, and Sakura, and Dan, and so on.
4392387	4394408	So that's going to do it for Part A of our show.
4394448	4395268	But don't go anywhere.
4395408	4395708	Darn it.
4395748	4397288	We've got plenty more of our show to come up.
4398168	4407371	Part B. Since Drew and Joe and everybody joined us late, I'll ask them about their gaming weeks at the start of Part B. And then we have some stuff to get into as well.
4407391	4408771	We're going to talk about the DSi.
4408851	4410371	Finally got a release date in North America.
4411231	4414172	Confirming some earlier rumors that were floating around out there.
4414272	4414812	That's so weird.
4414832	4416033	It's so weird how that happens.
4416593	4421334	Going to talk about some video game law here in California and some other Wii rumors.
4422374	4422914	Don't go anywhere.
4422934	4425475	We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4431897	4434098	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4434698	4437499	Here on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 22nd of 2009.
4438840	4444101	We're watching Loki playing Noby Noby Boy on Justin.TV and just giggling at the little farting noises it's making.
4444342	4446942	The secret word, Rob, is parakeet.
4448263	4448363	Ah!
4449957	4452378	Space Squirrel in the corner What kind of games have you been playing lately?
4478267	4478728	Pretty good.
4479748	4494360	Kim came to visit, so brought over the PS2, played some Karaoke Revolution, some Guitar Hero, King of Fighters 06, and surprisingly, a little bit of the original Naruto Ultimate Ninja.
4495521	4497322	I don't know why we were playing it, but we were playing it.
4498603	4499844	I wanted to because I was bored.
4501105	4501906	You asked for it.
4502967	4504308	You're the one who suggested it, not me.
4506385	4508126	I just so happen to bring it with me
4531175	4533056	I actually picked up Need for Speed Underground.
4533617	4534077	Oh, how's that?
4534737	4535478	It's kind of cool.
4535758	4536658	I want to get the second one.
4537199	4539080	How is it different from other Need for Speed games?
4540021	4540261	I don't know.
4540281	4542502	There's a lot of emphasis on tuning your car.
4544203	4545044	Making it look cool.
4545284	4546284	So it's like pimp my ride?
4546625	4547165	Pretty much.
4547905	4548626	Only more fun.
4550247	4550627	All right.
4550727	4551207	We got you.
4551988	4552268	All right.
4552328	4552788	Cool, cool.
4553109	4557992	Well, it looks like Loki's got everything switched back on Justin.TV from our break.
4558072	4558292	Uh-oh.
4558372	4558772	What happened?
4559192	4560153	We not getting audio over there?
4561795	4562075	Uh-oh.
4563795	4564576	We'll see what happens.
4565316	4566416	There might be some feedback.
4567356	4568156	Live radio.
4568256	4573918	Of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at allgames.com.
4575358	4577979	They don't see video, just audio for some reason on Justin.TV.
4578019	4580359	But again, Justin.TV is not the top priority.
4580379	4583620	We are trying to do a radio show, so we'll figure it out one way or another, I guess.
4584780	4588941	Anyhow, I want to get back into gaming news, but we need Loki.
4590287	4592007	The Nintendo DSi was announced this week that it would be coming out in the U.S.
4592047	4594548	and the rest of North America on April 5th.
4614397	4618099	Which is pretty close to estimates made by certain media outlets.
4618780	4624344	But it will be coming out in the North American region in two different colors.
4624544	4627926	Both black and kind of a light blue.
4629087	4631068	And will be retailing for $169.99.
4631768	4635591	Neat, I guess.
4638013	4638853	Yeah, I don't know.
4639774	4641515	I'm not probably going to pick one up myself.
4642455	4642736	But...
4644741	4645141	Thanks for watching!
4667588	4668089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4682020	4682781	It's Super Game!
4700037	4701338	Swap cartridges, I guess.
4701438	4705320	The problem with the blue DSi for me, and we have Actdeft in chat, says, I like the blue DSi.
4705340	4708022	The problem with the blue DSi for me, it's one of my high school's colors.
4708122	4710003	My old high school, that was actually one of their colors.
4710043	4712045	That gross, light blue type color.
4712345	4712685	Blah.
4713466	4714066	Not my favorite.
4715222	4723687	Also coming out on April 5th, a game that I'm sure a lot of our long-time listeners who are into music games, since that's what we started on, would be interested in.
4724087	4727929	Rhythm Heaven, also known as, of course, Rhythm Tengoku overseas.
4728529	4732371	Rhythm Heaven is going to be coming out on April 5th as well as the DSi systems.
4733272	4737194	Just so you know, this game was made by the same people that made WarioWare.
4737314	4740196	It's something like that, but it's more with music.
4740276	4742317	It's really hard to explain this game.
4742397	4743618	I played it at PAX.
4744358	4749642	So this game has kind of been ready a little while, but it's kind of some cool little musical mini-games.
4750183	4752464	So I think there'll be a lot of folks that enjoy that.
4752945	4759510	And I love this little alien character in the game too, and I've seen that on people's live journal icons and stuff, so there you go.
4760931	4765775	So that is coming out as well on April 5th, and I'm sure there'll be plenty of folks getting copies of that.
4767319	4772884	Well, there's actually supposed to be more games coming out.
4772904	4782932	They're saying that they're working on an adaptation of Katamari Damacy and Mr. Driller for the DSiWare, according to Famitsu, anyway.
4784313	4794241	There's also going to be a Wii game of Mr. Driller, Mr. Driller World, that has a DS version that's supposed to be called... Oh my god, how am I going to pronounce this?
4795742	4796663	Okay, I'm going to try...
4798399	4800559	I butcher names all the time in the Japanese release dates.
4800659	4800940	Alright.
4802120	4810782	Sekuto Hamureru Horihori Action which will have 17 levels to be out in Japan next week.
4812442	4812782	So there.
4813062	4816923	Alpha Catanagram in chat says that Katamari game is just a re-skinned pack attack.
4817303	4817623	Cheap.
4819243	4819543	Cheap.
4821224	4821904	Not surprising.
4822544	4827165	You know, they better make these releases good or people are going to say all these DSi things are cheap.
4828035	4828876	I don't know.
4854375	4860099	I don't know why, for whatever reason, I guess us Americans can't handle white.
4861040	4861900	It's gotta be blue.
4864342	4864803	Interesting.
4867424	4872888	Interesting as well that Europe usually gets screwed by Nintendo on release dates, but now it's...
4874699	4875359	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4901613	4906215	They finally signed a budget middle of last week after what, like 106, 109 days, something crazy.
4906715	4912357	Well, maybe they didn't pass the budget on time because they were too busy dealing with video game laws.
4912657	4913597	And guess what?
4913957	4920819	The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals came down this week and said that the California game law has been stricken.
4922060	4928902	Basically, they came out and placed a permanent injunction on it and it's no longer there.
4929763	4942052	The ESA President Michael Gallagher says this is a win, saying it sends a clear signal that these types of reckless legislations, it's wasting taxpayers' money, government time, and state resources.
4942192	4951198	Of course, Leland Yee, who has been heavily involved in this bill and everything, is pushing for California to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
4951519	4954541	By the way, I believe as a part of this, we will have to pay the ESV fees.
4955241	4959043	or ESA fees for this, just like another state had to do not that long ago.
4959063	4960184	I remember we covered on the show.
4960584	4962665	What a great thing for a broke state to be doing.
4965627	4968488	Maybe you guys should just give up on that whole thing.
4968929	4973471	So whenever we talk about these video game laws and them trying to censor video games and all this stuff, we get angsty.
4973911	4976753	And when we get angsty, FUs of the Week happen.
4993775	4997798	Believe it or not, I don't have any FUs.
4998058	5000000	No, I take that back, I do.
5000180	5001761	FU to people who don't know how to grow the fuck up.
5003542	5010727	And before anyone says anything, it's not who people may think I'm talking about, so... I knew you were talking about me.
5010987	5011368	I knew it.
5011928	5012208	Bitch!
5012228	5012769	Well, you know what?
5012789	5013529	I'm gonna cut you.
5014650	5017052	No, shoot, okay, I'm not gonna go into detail, but I have...
5017938	5019082	Okay, I'll go into a little detail.
5019102	5024400	I have a friend who, as long as I have known this person...
5027037	5028058	All righty, Loki.
5056687	5061770	Happy for the second week in a row to the weather for ruining yet another Airsoft outing.
5062330	5065551	I was supposed to be going on Sunday today, this morning.
5065932	5069333	However, it is raining and will continue to rain until next Sunday.
5069854	5071094	It's so retarded.
5071334	5075557	It was clear all week long and then fucking rained on Sunday.
5075917	5077698	The day that I'm going.
5078878	5080279	So fuck you, Mother Nature.
5080479	5081780	Fuck you right up your ass.
5083420	5085261	Is it possible to fuck Mother Nature in her ass?
5085301	5085922	I don't know about that.
5086758	5093583	Um, I just, I'm gonna say an FU to the fact I'm kinda hungry, and so I'm gonna eat something soon.
5094743	5095544	FU to hunger pains.
5096365	5098106	Uh, Drew, you got any FUs?
5100467	5100848	Yeah.
5101328	5104510	First off, FU to shitty service at... Huh?
5105351	5108132	Okay, FU to shitty service at the Arden Fair Mall today.
5109874	5111835	Okay.
5111855	5114737	20 minutes to prepare a meal at the Hibachi.
5115637	5116158	What the fuck?
5117000	5117400	I order.
5117560	5119081	Somehow there's a line formed.
5119241	5121181	Oh, let's not go to Panda Express.
5121201	5122782	Let's go to Hibachi-san.
5122802	5125062	Let's go to Hibachi-san, I said.
5125202	5126423	There's no line, I said.
5126963	5127563	Oh, no.
5128643	5131164	On top of everything else, we try to get portraits taken.
5131764	5133205	And that shit takes an hour and a half.
5133865	5135526	Causing us to be late for the show.
5137166	5138126	I'm not too pleased.
5138807	5140047	Also, fuck you to the weather.
5140267	5141627	Fuck it in its fucking ear.
5142107	5143208	I'm sick and tired of it.
5144315	5147236	It's sunny and then suddenly it rains.
5147857	5149918	Way to end the week on a good note.
5152058	5152779	Kim, did you have anything?
5153419	5154439	F you to being sick.
5154700	5156340	I hate being sick on vacation.
5156360	5156961	It sucks.
5157381	5158401	Being sick does suck.
5158981	5159362	All right.
5160302	5162723	And Joe, do you have anything for our listeners for angst?
5163543	5166545	Yeah, fuck being hungry.
5167185	5168025	Fuck being hungry.
5168966	5169266	All right.
5170925	5173909	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
5174870	5175551	Dark Sakura.
5176772	5179015	That was a very interesting way that you just said my name.
5179876	5180537	Dark Sakura.
5181258	5181618	Okay.
5182339	5183000	So, Disney!
5186719	5194268	Disney is bringing Spectrobes Origins to Wii, supposed to be coming out in the fall.
5194789	5202858	It's motion sensing, you know, large real-time battle thing, full 3D RPG world, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
5203639	5216092	So there are the two DS versions, Spectrobes and Spectrobes Beyond the Portals, are already everywhere, so it's more Spectrobes.
5217313	5217734	Yay?
5217754	5219095	The end.
5221631	5222331	Yay, the end.
5222591	5223672	It's supposed to be pretty good.
5223752	5224193	I don't know.
5224253	5229437	I mean, it's not a game I'm remotely interested in, but from what I hear, it's supposed to be pretty good.
5229497	5230998	It's been popular, I guess.
5231238	5232800	Is it maybe just for a particular audience?
5233861	5240126	Yeah, well, what they're doing now, they're actually launching, I think, a cartoon as well, which will help because it's kind of like Pokemon.
5240166	5243729	I mean, the game is very Pokemon, Digimon-esque, so...
5245888	5248930	I don't know, really not from my age group at all.
5249090	5255653	Wait, Refresh Memory Spectrums, wasn't that gimmicky bullshit game where you had to yell at the things to turn them into little monsters?
5256233	5265418	I don't remember that, but it was the one that had the special cards that you place over the DS touchscreen where you tap the spots and it will unlock different things.
5266819	5266919	Oh.
5268035	5270459	Yeah, so anyways, it's supposed to be pretty decent.
5270479	5272262	At least they're trying to be innovative with it.
5272602	5276529	And, you know, I don't know, maybe they'll bring their D-Gamer service over onto the Wii.
5276549	5277250	That'd be pretty sweet.
5277951	5278933	But I doubt it.
5279994	5280994	I doubt it a lot.
5282075	5289857	Anyways, if you're not interested though in Spectrobes, there are some rumors of other games that are coming out that might be worth it.
5290598	5293219	Brutal Legends is rumored to possibly coming out to the Wii.
5294299	5296120	And that's interesting.
5296620	5297580	There's some other stuff.
5297840	5301201	Apparently this is all from EA and Activision's 2009 lineup.
5301661	5305503	Activision's DJ Hero is tentatively scheduled for July.
5306970	5309851	It seems like a weird time to put that out if that were actually the case.
5311271	5318594	Apparently, DJ Hero will feature a three... The peripheral will feature three colored buttons, a turntable, and a fader.
5319894	5321855	Well, if that's the case, they're in for a lawsuit.
5323956	5327838	This second LEGO Indiana Jones game will be out apparently before Christmas.
5328578	5329158	I can see that.
5330199	5333900	Activision will release a new Guitar Hero song pack around the holiday season.
5334461	5341004	That kind of goes in line with, I think there was a Guitar Hero Greatest Hits or something like that they're planning on putting out.
5341564	5342584	So that might make sense.
5344805	5347927	Star Wars Battlefront 3 is still live but probably won't be out until 2010.
5347987	5349507	Well, of course that makes sense.
5349848	5352549	Because, you know, even though, was it...
5354383	5355964	Not Pandemic, who am I thinking of?
5356825	5357205	Ah, whatever.
5358065	5360026	Still, a game like that, very epic.
5360307	5361427	Of course they're going to make another one.
5363108	5364189	Those are all rumors for right now.
5364909	5365510	Rumors.
5365790	5367531	Things that we might see a little more of at E3.
5368171	5378978	Yeah, well, going to the DJ Hero thing, you know, I've seen prototypes of the other DJ game coming out in...
5380706	5388632	If that's the case, if it's got a crossfader and stuff, that makes me kind of wonder if there might be a lawsuit because their controller looks very similar.
5389432	5389873	Hmm.
5390093	5390813	We'll see what happens.
5391834	5393255	Well, Lego.
5393495	5394496	Gosh, those Lego games.
5394516	5395376	They sure know how to sell.
5395396	5398258	The Lego Batman, the Lego Star Wars, Lego Indiana Jones.
5398278	5399920	Well, guess what's next?
5400882	5402684	Lego Prince of Persia
5422344	5425305	But you never know, could be a game later on.
5425345	5427426	Lego Harry Potter's the next one, for sure.
5427566	5431648	Well, other than Lego Battles, but in Lego MMO, maybe Lego Racers.
5431868	5436730	No Lego Prince of Persia game yet, but Lego Prince of Persia toys are definitely going to be happening.
5436810	5438431	I could see them doing a Lego Harry Potter game.
5439291	5440291	I could really see that too.
5440412	5442652	The audiences kind of go hand in hand.
5446670	5447831	Veto Veto Veto Veto Veto
5475478	5477659	Me giving DarkSakura the finger makes for great radio.
5477699	5478839	Although Justin TV can see it.
5479460	5480701	Bob's a cheeky monkey.
5481081	5481741	Cheeky monkey.
5482281	5483222	All right, males.
5484843	5486324	Well, one's kind of a plug.
5486864	5488085	I'm sure you saw this email.
5488105	5488765	I'm going to go ahead and plug it.
5488785	5489045	A plug.
5489285	5489586	All right.
5492667	5493828	We hear from Redertainment.
5495388	5497890	The Hawk by Hunter Red Novel
5516519	5517759	Free distribution online.
5518419	5521780	Advocate literacy.
5523521	5525341	So, first actual email.
5525521	5527682	I can see DarkSakura doing a PSA for reading.
5528022	5528902	Read, goddammit!
5530683	5531863	Read or you're crap!
5534343	5535144	Read something, you idiot!
5535184	5536284	Illiteracy is stupid!
5537685	5538065	Alright, now...
5559893	5565198	Additionally, with regard to you and your wind complaints tonight, it could be worse.
5565258	5571423	At least you folks don't have planes crashing in your area, just in case other listeners don't remember me mentioning it before.
5571463	5572464	I live in Buffalo, New York.
5573345	5575587	Actually, we do have planes crashing in our area.
5575607	5578789	There was one that crashed, I think, in Elk Grove or something.
5578809	5579770	I didn't hear about that.
5581411	5588861	The guy was doing takeoff and touchdown landings and one of those landings he forgot to lower the landing gear and caught the plane on fire.
5590824	5591505	So no one got hurt.
5591525	5592286	It was only one pilot.
5592306	5593528	But still, it's a plane crash.
5593548	5593948	It counts.
5597016	5598217	That's a crash due to stupid.
5600799	5607144	Also, in case you haven't read, seen, listened to the news for the last past few days, there was a commercial plane crash, blah, blah, blah.
5607184	5611948	Also, Buffalo, last Thursday night, specifically in the suburb of Clarence, at least, you're just dealing with wind.
5612488	5613429	Yeah, you've been negated.
5614801	5623706	If I may, and if DarkSakura has time to read this, I'd just like to say hi, in quotes, to the Dark Fury link shell on the Alexander server in Final Fantasy XI.
5623866	5624126	Add it!
5624786	5629209	And specifically to Jaden, Nagiko, and Digby Reloaded.
5629349	5630409	Now go play a real game.
5630790	5631650	That was from Spazinator.
5631710	5632471	I'm just kidding.
5634352	5635292	I'm always so rude.
5635312	5636293	Go play a real game.
5636313	5636933	Play Perfect World.
5637033	5640495	I spent years and years and years on Final Fantasy XI, just in case you guys don't know.
5640735	5644137	And City of Heroes, I'm sorry, is WoW without the suck.
5647437	5648498	It's WoW with Barbie.
5648518	5649638	It's WoW with superheroes.
5649758	5650978	It's WoW with Barbie mode.
5650998	5651779	That's fun!
5652319	5655180	Oh my god, making the superhero, and you can save them.
5655720	5658361	Just let me know when the hell I can debate it.
5658541	5659841	It's so great.
5659961	5662462	I've made so many superhero costumes in the last week.
5663303	5667824	Because every time I would actually try to log in and play the damn game, lose connection, log out.
5668945	5669445	Fuck you.
5669945	5670165	Dope.
5670808	5672169	Anyway, that's another story.
5672550	5673731	Alright, was that it for mailbag?
5673751	5674531	Last email.
5674551	5675232	Oh no, one more, yay.
5676073	5678135	Jeez, Rob, I could just not read it.
5678155	5681798	Hey, when I went in there earlier, there was only like two emails, so I'm happy to hear there's more emails.
5681978	5683580	Um, it's actually from the same guy.
5684480	5684601	Oh.
5685081	5686502	Because he sent the email late.
5686863	5687883	Oh, there we go.
5687944	5688724	I'll just read it anyway.
5689185	5689385	Sure.
5689445	5691607	Hi, folks, I just wanted to comment on a few things.
5691747	5693529	Firstly, firstly is not a word, okay?
5693549	5696571	Just say first, or first of all, or...
5697472	5703834	In the beginning, no, FYI, I sent you an email last week during, during, only should have one R in it, thank you.
5704455	5706735	But apparently, I sent it too late.
5707436	5708776	Not T-O-T-O-O, thank you.
5709577	5711957	I'm sorry, you send late emails, you get grammar-nated.
5714578	5721061	Needless to say, that it can be disregarded simply because I ended up calling in and repeated what was in the email.
5721721	5724282	Secondly, like, okay, Rob, your name is not Robb.
5726604	5727644	I ended up getting Flower too.
5727664	5729445	Maybe he was drunk when he did the email.
5729645	5732725	Maybe.
5732845	5734685	I agree, it's a great game and very beautiful.
5735046	5736986	Not only that, but it's rather relaxing.
5737386	5741327	I hate to call it a casual game, seeing as the term doesn't quite seem to fit the game.
5741767	5745027	Rather, I think calling Flower a zen game seems to describe it a bit better.
5745567	5748688	By the way, here's an easy way to get two trophies for it.
5749088	5753909	Play a level as normal, go do something for 10 minutes between levels, and bam, one trophy unlocked.
5754609	5757571	Another one can be unlocked by simply backing out of the game.
5757631	5759993	Fast forward the system clock by a week and re-enter the game.
5760033	5760954	Then you'll get the second trophy.
5760974	5764416	What do you think though about the analogy that it's a racing game?
5764657	5766418	Flowers is just a big fruity racing game.
5768091	5776779	I'm sure the email, if it could grow sentience and speak on its own on behalf of Spazinator, it would probably tell you boobs.
5777921	5786308	On an unrelated note, Rob commented that $60 for a game is kind of expensive, especially if you're only somewhat into a given series.
5786749	5791073	Well, I would just like to point out that with the previous gen systems in their games...
5791573	5798855	When taking inflation into consideration, the older games are just as expensive as current-gen games, and in some situations, even more expensive.
5799415	5801416	Well, thank you for allowing me to throw in my two cents.
5801936	5805257	Inflation, dude, it should be two bucks, and better bring chocolate with that.
5805717	5811299	This email is sponsored by GTA 4, Lost in the Damned, and Oscar Mayer, home of the never-ending supply of wieners.
5812805	5813947	I like being a rampaging bitch.
5828567	5834512	Quote Flower No, I didn't play Flower until this week No, I was talking about the $60 No, I was reading the comment in chat
5849245	5849345	Oh.
5851466	5853446	Next week's show is on the server.
5853486	5854866	I just need to push it to the podcast feed.
5854906	5857227	We do it a little differently now on the new website.
5857407	5860348	And I kind of botched the first one, I think.
5860448	5862368	So I'm being a little careful before I do 3.13.
5863609	5867369	But I am trying to get the podcast all caught up so people don't complain anymore.
5867850	5868810	So there we go.
5869870	5873372	Alright, let's move back into some gaming news.
5874292	5875132	More emails though.
5875353	5878954	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Don't send them.
5879214	5880575	Send them, please.
5882456	5882936	Okay.
5883936	5884897	I'm being silly.
5886164	5894550	Yes, apparently, once again, there's more rumors pointing to the next Tony Hawk game using a brand new skateboarding controller.
5894970	5897271	I'm sure we're going to see this at E3.
5897491	5900914	I mean, it only makes sense that they're going to pull this stuff out.
5903456	5912261	Variety is confirming this, saying their sources show a new controller along with some details.
5912301	5914642	Apparently, it won't be about precise balance.
5915142	5922506	Instead, it will be about grabbing and manipulating the board to pull all sorts of tricks from which Tony Hawk games are known for.
5924847	5925468	Interesting.
5926508	5929290	Something tells me that this... I don't know.
5929310	5929550	I don't know.
5931129	5939293	Why can't we just have the Tony Hawk Pro Skater stuff where it was fun, it was whimsical, you're pulling off tricks in a mall or something ridiculous.
5939313	5942014	Or why can't we just fire Tony Hawk out of a cannon at this point?
5942074	5943134	I mean, I'm just kind of done.
5943154	5945435	It's not Tony Hawk's fault, okay?
5945875	5948977	This is just like the same argument that an actor ruins a movie.
5949557	5952718	Now, that may be the case sometimes, but it's not Tony Hawk's fault.
5952779	5953939	It's Activision's fault.
5954239	5954559	Fine.
5954639	5956520	Why can't we fire Activision out of a cannon?
5957401	5957741	I don't know.
5958621	5959261	None of cannons.
5959922	5960542	Will it blend?
5962065	5962745	Yes, it will blend.
5962805	5967328	It will blend because the blending blades are made of the hairs from Chuck Norris' legs.
5968769	5969109	Great.
5969189	5971470	Baron's chat has leaked into Orange Lounge Radio.
5974192	5978814	And you know that that's not true because there's nothing that could cut a hair on Chuck Norris' leg.
5981395	5981916	Die!
5982416	5984477	But he can make them out himself and market them.
5985618	5985998	Good point.
5986923	5987483	Thanks for watching!
6006092	6006412	VIRTUA COP
6028641	6030242	And this was in an interview with Cube3.
6030362	6032923	This is the producer, Neil McEwan.
6033483	6037724	He said they would love to do Virtua Cop or another light gun game for Sega.
6038684	6040065	So, there you go.
6040945	6050168	Apparently, the whole House of the Dead thing came to be when they were meeting with Sega about possibly doing a game in one of their franchises, and House of the Dead is what was settled on.
6050529	6057231	However, if they continue, and you know this game does well, and they decide they want to do another game, could Virtua Cop be a possibility?
6058510	6058970	We'll see.
6059010	6062333	I don't know how y'all feel about that, but it could be interesting.
6063453	6063974	So we'll see.
6066535	6071138	Do I gotta... Yeah, and GameGuru in chat says, Sega, let them do Virtua Cop.
6072099	6073220	Shadowchari says, yes!
6074801	6076242	Virtua Cop would actually be pretty fun.
6076662	6078623	I had a lot of fun playing it when it was new.
6080203	6080643	Sorry.
6081384	6086386	The whole Virtua series, they should just rename Virtua Fighter to, oh look, another 3D fighter.
6086946	6089167	Or Virtua Cop 2, look, another gun game.
6090047	6090567	Something like that.
6090787	6091027	Anyway.
6092808	6097830	Well, there's something wonderful that came out to Club Nintendo members in Japan.
6098210	6099431	It was special.
6100451	6107714	They could get a Wii controller that looked like an SNES pad, and now you can get one too for $75, courtesy of PlayAsia.
6110353	6115016	But hey, it looks just like a real SNES pad.
6118357	6120438	Even though it's really a Wii Classic controller.
6122119	6122800	Whatever the fuck.
6124281	6125461	You know, I'll probably get one.
6125721	6126622	The real deal.
6127902	6129503	Or I'll just probably break out my paint.
6131544	6132585	Ooh, it does look pretty cool, though.
6132865	6136127	I don't know, it's kind of expensive.
6137608	6138088	You know what?
6138188	6139769	You could totally either rewire...
6141519	6152164	I bet you anything, because keep in mind, the classic controller actually is in the shape of the Super Famicom controller, which was slightly different shape than our Super Nintendo controller, as you'll recall, right?
6153224	6160948	You can, though, get Super Famicom controllers at, like, eBay, anywhere, really, and probably just reshell it.
6161068	6162569	You know, that's not hard at all.
6163689	6164189	I'd do it.
6165190	6165850	I'm a cheap bitch.
6166491	6167411	Ha ha ha ha ha!
6169358	6169659	I don't know.
6169679	6174247	I'm kind of over the whole Wii Virtual Console stuff until they put something really good on there.
6175509	6178154	I don't really need this controller.
6179356	6179737	We'll see.
6181587	6185550	I definitely don't need this controller because I don't play virtual console games anymore.
6185570	6185970	No, you don't.
6186611	6188852	Yes, which is too bad.
6189573	6194116	But there are some other retro games that might be interesting, including some fictional ones.
6194917	6206386	D3, the publisher behind the new parody game Eat Lead the Return of Matt Hazard, is actually planning on releasing some of these retro parodies on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.
6207206	6234233	um supposed to be coming out this summer at some point no word on exactly what it is but it'll probably one of the in joke um games that are going to be you know part of this game itself I thought I heard a rumor though that there was going to be some of those games unlockable in you know eat lead so I don't really know what they're going to be doing there but I don't know that'd be kind of neat if they're good but otherwise you know if the you know I think also it kind of
6235416	6240478	Hopefully Eat Lead does well, because otherwise you're going to have some spin-off of a game that sucked.
6240979	6242019	No one's going to really want to play it.
6242800	6243460	So, we'll see.
6243700	6247962	I don't know much about this series, but I'm assuming this chat comment is in reference to this.
6248022	6250583	GameGuru says, Has Matt Karts will be interesting.
6251184	6251404	Yeah.
6253004	6254405	Well, it's a fictional game series.
6255105	6255646	Interesting.
6256403	6261227	You know, speaking of, like, fictional games and stuff, what is that retro game that came out on DS this week that sounds really interesting?
6261267	6263549	Or last week, I think it was, the Retro Game Collection or something like that?
6263569	6265491	Yeah, Retro Game Challenge, the Game Center CX.
6265531	6267012	That sounds kind of funny.
6267572	6268473	I want to check that game out.
6268513	6276300	They have the sequel just came out in Japan, too, and it's actually one of the retro games, and it's actually like a 16-bit game now, which is supposed to be a big deal.
6277060	6277461	But, um...
6278246	6279007	It's interesting.
6279167	6281388	I like that they had old magazines and stuff in there.
6282028	6282569	It's all made up.
6282849	6283830	There's another one.
6284070	6288593	I don't remember what it was called now, but it was that PSP game, the one that you play 30 seconds at a time.
6289013	6289914	I saw a video on that.
6290154	6290854	Oh, yeah.
6290874	6292055	And it looks awesome.
6292135	6293936	It's so cheesy.
6294236	6295897	I don't remember the name of it.
6295937	6297038	We covered it in a previous show.
6297058	6298159	I remember talking about that, though.
6300541	6314133	Musha30 looks awesome looking forward to checking that out you had to go to towns and stuff like that and you really had 30 seconds in between each thing but you can get more time if you visit certain people
6314804	6336896	and AcidicVampire in chat says retro game challenge is really good I just got it this past week this is why I like having a live chat room during the show you know not a lot of podcasts can do this there's some out there you know some of the others that are on all games but not a lot of podcasts can do this kind of interacting and get answers live when we're stumped like I don't remember the name of that game somebody usually knows it or we get instant game reviews on these games we haven't we're too poor to check out so
6338350	6338711	Quake 3 Quake 3
6353739	6359821	I think it is Quake 3, yes, but Quake Live is apparently going to start the open beta this next week.
6360261	6366423	All the statistics that are on the server now, they're going to be kicked out from the closed beta.
6367103	6372185	Tuesday, February 24th is apparently when the open beta testing period is going to be announced.
6372685	6375286	Quake Live, again, is a web-based version of Quake.
6377616	6379617	I'm sure they're going to change some things.
6379657	6381839	I don't think it's just a port of the game.
6382679	6389883	All you have to do if you want to check this out, just go to www.quakelive.com on February 24th and check it out.
6390123	6391004	Maybe I'll be there playing.
6392970	6393791	Oregon Trail
6420851	6422892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6450187	6451548	And you can die of dysentery!
6451788	6454129	I know, I was going to say, now I can ford the river wherever I go.
6454149	6455130	It'd be awesome.
6455510	6455730	Yes.
6457391	6457731	Great.
6457931	6459652	That's what UnfoldedRaptor in our chatroom says.
6459712	6460632	Dysentery on the go.
6462753	6470797	Somebody in our chatroom, I don't even know if I should say the name, because they were in the NDA beta, says, everybody play it, the Quake Live.
6471578	6473279	So, apparently it's really good.
6475174	6477236	and I'm hearing a lot of endorsements for it.
6477917	6478317	Sounds good.
6479378	6480980	Alright, let's move on.
6481020	6481881	Just a couple more stories.
6481901	6486486	We're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6486506	6487687	We'll be opening that very soon.
6487707	6489829	We just got a couple quick more stories for you guys.
6489869	6493894	Speaking of beta testing, Sony is looking for some new game testers as well.
6494695	6496136	What will you be possibly playing?
6496376	6497758	A new game machine.
6499192	6508637	Hmm, people are thinking that it's going to be either part of the PlayStation Portable Series or possibly maybe even like a PlayStation Phone or something like that.
6509897	6511598	Could it be possibly the PlayStation 4?
6511718	6517041	I'm thinking a little early for that, but I can see maybe like the PSP 4000 or something.
6517161	6519142	Could it be a new enhancement to PlayStation 3?
6519602	6526126	Could it be like a new home, I don't know, like a home type thing, like an expansion that all PlayStation users will have?
6526146	6526546	I don't know.
6527628	6528449	Is that a possibility?
6528629	6529590	Or is this like hardware?
6530230	6530971	It's going to be hardware.
6531051	6531732	New game machine.
6531952	6532312	Interesting.
6532552	6533553	It's probably PSP version 2.
6533593	6535395	Basically, they're looking for someone.
6535975	6539618	It's a job listing on Sony Computer Entertainment Japan's website.
6540199	6544543	It says it's asking for someone to evaluate and assess a new game's machine.
6545644	6548707	Ponzi in our chatroom suggests it will be the PS2.5.
6548927	6551969	Could it be yet another reiteration of the PlayStation 2, you think?
6552069	6552449	Maybe.
6552469	6554311	Well, not the PS2.
6554691	6559255	Maybe a new PSP, kind of like DSi that's enhanced but plays the old stuff.
6559275	6560456	They just had a new PSP.
6560976	6564338	Yeah, but I'm talking about when it actually redesigns the PSP.
6564378	6565739	Like a PSP Part 2.
6565779	6568561	Not like something that, oh look, now it has a microphone on it.
6568621	6569301	That's retarded.
6569461	6571163	Or, oh look, now it's a little bit slimmer.
6571583	6575625	I'm talking about something that actually, oh look, it's another analog stick.
6575785	6579908	Or, you know, now the screen's bigger and shinier.
6580068	6580408	I don't know.
6580849	6582110	Now I can make phone calls with it.
6583631	6584051	We'll see.
6585199	6588341	I actually liked that game that I played on the Gizmondo, the guitar game.
6588441	6589101	That was pretty fun.
6612136	6614158	The Johnny Whatever, was that what it was called?
6614438	6615739	Wow, how do I remember that?
6616399	6623284	It was actually a fun little game when I could hear it at E3 years and years ago.
6624205	6626527	One of the wonderful downsides to E3.
6626627	6630850	Acidic Vampire says he wants the PSP to make dinner and bring a beer.
6632431	6632651	What?
6634352	6634733	I don't know.
6635253	6637815	GameGuru, you were like, do you have an iPhone?
6639559	6642724	If you have an iPhone, you're allowed to make that assessment.
6644388	6646471	It said the iPhone is a lousy gaming device.
6647333	6651942	You're allowed to make that assessment if you've actually played games on one for a significant amount of time.
6653277	6654337	Alright, let me move on.
6654397	6656718	I got one more story, then we'll open up the Skype line.
6656738	6657679	Maybe they'll call in, who knows.
6658439	6661960	Hideo Kojima is going to get another Lifetime Achievement Award.
6662500	6670643	He's only 45 years old, by the way, but he has met his Lifetime Achievement from the Game Developers Choice Awards, which are happening on March 25th.
6671424	6674024	So Hideo Kojima is going to be getting that award.
6674965	6676845	You know, because he kind of made Metal Gear and all.
6677146	6680447	So... Kind of makes sense that...
6681431	6682031	Thank you for watching!
6697816	6698597	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6725225	6726446	Anyhow, random story.
6726846	6732231	Now let's take your random calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
6732271	6735233	The Skype line is now open and we'll get to those calls momentarily.
6735253	6740698	There's a little gap between when we say something live and when they actually go out over the radio.
6741018	6742139	Oh, nope, we're getting a call already.
6742640	6745542	So we'll take this call and then we'll get some last minute stories.
6746343	6747323	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6747344	6747664	Who's this?
6748665	6749265	Deathwishing.
6749425	6750406	Hello, Deathwishing.
6750426	6750906	What's on your mind?
6752020	6755402	Street Fighter 4 It was a Street Fighter cabinet, that's all I know
6781305	6781625	Dan's homo What?
6781645	6783587	If you can kick somebody's ass with Dan, then you are awesome
6811958	6813519	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6831772	6834517	I mean, the AI in the game is ruthless, though.
6834617	6835378	Holy crap.
6836200	6837582	Seth, my god.
6837783	6840528	Yeah, we were talking about how Seth is a bastard.
6840628	6843453	All I know is just don't use the 360 controller for it.
6844074	6844895	I have to use that.
6845507	6846068	It sucks.
6846248	6857756	I almost got it on PlayStation 3 based on the controller alone, but then I realized I think I know maybe two or three people playing it on PlayStation 3, and I know far more on the 360, so I finally caved and got 360.
6857856	6864682	All I know is if you want to play, invest in a fight pad, because I heard those are really good, and they're like the Sega controller.
6864982	6868124	And then the tournament edition stick is super accurate.
6868364	6870226	You can just pull off the same move over and over.
6871667	6873108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6898092	6898672	How was that?
6898732	6902775	I've heard some reports coming in from plenty of those around the country.
6903055	6903536	How did you do?
6905037	6910120	One beat five people, then got beat by a guy who's ranked three in California.
6910480	6910941	Wait, wait, wait.
6911201	6915224	But you've not played the game since you were like five, yet you did that well in the tournament?
6915244	6920747	Because I chose a place to go to that I knew people would walk in to be like, oh, look, a tournament.
6922068	6923369	Oh, like at the mall or something?
6923850	6924130	Yeah.
6924450	6925451	Okay, that makes sense.
6925871	6926371	That makes sense.
6926872	6927032	Huh.
6927052	6927112	Huh.
6928197	6929118	Deathwishing Killzone 2 JTV
6958048	6960090	You can get those demo codes, though, right?
6960110	6961351	But only if you, what, pre-ordered it?
6961731	6964994	Yeah, if you pre-ordered the game, you could have got the multiplayer demo or something.
6965014	6968377	Yeah, I think that's just the normal demo, actually.
6968397	6971959	Well, I saw some people giving away codes on Twitter for it, so I know it must have been kind of hard to get.
6972640	6973320	It's not hard to get.
6973340	6975282	You just create a European account and done.
6976763	6978364	I have it on my PS3 right now.
6979305	6979966	Sneaky, sneaky.
6980666	6981627	Thank you, British people.
6982007	6985768	Well, then maybe we need to fire up Killzone and compete with the other channel.
6985828	6987609	No, I have no idea who else is showing it.
6988669	6990430	It's hot-blooded gaming or something.
6991850	6992270	It's so interesting.
6992290	6996612	When we first started on Justin.TV, there really was not a lot of gaming stuff on there at all.
6997372	7000773	But now there's tons of people just kind of showing what they play on there.
7001413	7002673	But hey, props to them.
7003434	7005714	It's definitely expanded the community over there on Justin.TV.
7005734	7008035	Alright, well, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
7008095	7008815	But thanks for the call, buddy.
7008835	7009055	Alright?
7009336	7009836	Alright, thanks.
7009896	7010236	Have a good one.
7010256	7010556	Have a good day.
7012297	7020703	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
7020783	7025367	Hello, Actdeft, how are you doing?
7028109	7037676	Awesome, awesome, we have a little bit of lag probably because of the fact that you are in another country So why don't you go ahead and ask us your question or whatever you called in about tonight
7040143	7051772	Well, I basically wanted to talk about Street Fighter 4 here in Mexico because something pretty bad happened, especially with the collector's edition for PlayStation 3.
7052893	7053754	Please, tell us about it.
7053774	7055415	It's a pretty big shortage.
7057537	7058197	How did it happen?
7058237	7059198	How did the shortage happen?
7061600	7061860	Well...
7063436	7065057	Nobody knows how it happened.
7065117	7065978	It just happened.
7066879	7078807	Basically, most of the stores that had pre-orders for the Street Fighter 4 version on the PS3, the first edition one, basically got cut off by Capcom.
7079808	7087033	And they didn't get sent all the pre-orders they had in stock or they had planned to sell.
7089042	7089802	That's so strange.
7089902	7093443	Were they redirected to the US to maybe meet demand?
7093543	7097104	And they were like, well, we could screw over other countries if we meet the demand here.
7097124	7098404	It seems a little odd.
7101104	7102965	Yeah, most people are thinking that.
7103165	7107246	And that's pretty much it because it got sold out in the US.
7109706	7111126	Screw Mexico, possibly.
7112006	7114587	I'm sorry for the PS3 owners that
7115331	7117912	If I'm correct, I'm pretty sure it's around
7146163	7151865	1,500 pesos for the collector's edition and 1,000 for the regular edition.
7152625	7164028	Though most people on the, not to call it the black market, but on the maybe what we call here at the Angles,
7164898	7168621	That would be a flea market or a swap meet.
7169361	7172844	They could sell it for over 2,000 pesos.
7172884	7177948	That would be like around $150 on the US.
7178448	7178909	Wow, yeah.
7178929	7180450	I'm just looking at conversion rates right now.
7182271	7185194	It's about 10.8 pesos to the dollar.
7185614	7186034	So let's see.
7186074	7188356	He said it would be about 1,500 to get it legitimately.
7188436	7189117	Divide that by 10.8598.
7189157	7189797	It's actually 1,450.
7194983	7196525	Wow, that's like $138 or $130.
7196565	7196825	Wow.
7197046	7198347	Yeah.
7200450	7204835	So sometimes we're a little spoiled here, so we have to remember that.
7204895	7208180	Well, you know, maybe next time you need to get some friends in the U.S.
7208440	7212525	and just mail you the game or something, you probably get it faster and cheaper.
7213546	7213707	Yeah.
7214551	7215712	Yeah, most possibly.
7216533	7220936	It's a good thing that I got the 360 version over at Amazon.
7222217	7223158	I'm not going to worry about it.
7223658	7228362	Out of curiosity, I don't know if you know the answer to this or not, but are you able to order games from the U.S.?
7228422	7231124	Like, say, you can order a game from Amazon.com in the U.S.
7231144	7233126	and have it shipped to Mexico, or do they not do that?
7236048	7238991	Basically, I'm getting some help from my friend.
7240032	7242293	The game is going to be delivered over the U.S.,
7243726	7245909	I'm pretty much next to the border.
7246390	7247852	You can go and pick it up.
7248313	7251057	I just paid with my Mexican credit card.
7251077	7251938	That I can do.
7253000	7255984	But I cannot ship games over here.
7256947	7260329	I can get movies and I think books, but everything else, no.
7261050	7266073	It's actually like that for Amazon UK.
7266293	7274258	I can order books and they'll ship here, but I can't order a game or a toy from the UK.
7274358	7275979	I'd have to ship it to a UK address.
7276359	7278681	Well, plus you'd get into region issues at that point, right?
7279560	7283684	Well, even though we got screwed on the pre-S3 version of the collector's edition of Street Fighter 4,
7304861	7312322	Basically, the rest of the world, Mexico, Japan, and Europe got the 360 ring controller, that it has a definitely better D-pad.
7312402	7315863	I have two controllers here with me, and they definitely work.
7316063	7326945	And it's basically the same controller as the white one that comes with the console, though the D-pad, you see it, and it's the same, but you feel it, and it's definitely better.
7327225	7328885	I really hope they think about it.
7328925	7332286	Super Street Fighter Turbo with it, and it's definitely better.
7332717	7333377	Yeah, thanks.
7353655	7355757	Alright, if you want to give us a call, we'll take another one.
7355777	7358819	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7358899	7360541	But wait, we already have a call dropped in.
7360601	7361682	Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7361702	7362022	Who's this?
7363083	7365845	It's a kind of exhausted Jason.
7366145	7370269	Jason, am I exhausting you from all my needy tells about the podcast feed?
7370549	7371490	I'm like, I don't understand.
7371530	7372871	I followed Deep Man's instructions.
7372891	7373932	That just put it on the website.
7373952	7374973	It didn't put it on the feed.
7375053	7375673	Help me, Jason.
7375693	7376054	No, no.
7376154	7377094	It's actually kind of weird.
7377154	7378275	I haven't... It's...
7379176	7379476	I don't know.
7379616	7381078	And then it disappeared from the website.
7381158	7381458	I don't know.
7381498	7382879	I need to talk to Deke Man about it.
7382939	7383319	I don't know.
7384220	7384820	I'm confused.
7385061	7387042	But I have one more episode to get us all caught up.
7387082	7388783	And then I'm going to try and get tonight's episode up.
7389464	7390845	I don't know if it will realistically happen tomorrow.
7390885	7392066	Tomorrow is my mother's birthday.
7392646	7395869	So I have to go out and spend some time with her.
7396549	7399251	Which, by the way, if I am not mistaking, this is 68.
7400672	7401453	My mother is going to be.
7401573	7402334	So, yep.
7403214	7403895	Anyhow, sorry.
7404475	7405256	Not that everybody cares.
7405596	7407518	But anyways, Jason, what did you call in to talk about tonight?
7407538	7407978	I'm on the phone.
7408160	7415325	I was going to say that your parents are old, but at the same time, you are also older than me by a fair margin.
7416646	7417606	But my parents had me late.
7417626	7418567	My mom had me when she was 38.
7419087	7419968	No, wait, that wouldn't make sense.
7419988	7420628	She'd have to be turning 69.
7422289	7423170	Wow, I'm a bad kid.
7423210	7426912	I don't even know how old my mom is, but it all starts to blend together after 65.
7427773	7429874	So yeah, I guess she's going to be 69, actually.
7431915	7432896	Anyhow, what did you call in about?
7432916	7434137	Surely you didn't call in to talk about my mom.
7435616	7436116	I don't know.
7436296	7438717	Anyways.
7439998	7448980	The Tony Hawk story is kind of interesting because the only thing that comes to mind, there's only two things that come to mind when they talk about a custom controller.
7449401	7459384	The first one is the arcade cabinet, the skateboard that Topskater had in the entire arcade cabinet set up.
7460376	7470222	and then the only other thing that comes to mind is that since we have wireless controllers now, something resembling like those tech decks that were really popular between 5 and 10 years ago.
7472283	7474324	Wow, I haven't heard about a tech deck in a long time.
7475065	7476286	Exactly, exactly.
7476946	7483230	And it's just kind of... I'm trying to envision myself... First of all, I sucked with those things.
7483290	7485751	I couldn't do anything on those stupid things.
7486392	7488093	But it's...
7489824	7490304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7514747	7543252	and I think the angle might make a difference too or something like that or the way that you shift the skateboard on its mount but it's just it sounds so stupid to me because we have a controller that works for this stuff already it's the same thing that I said with Home on the PS3 we have an interface we have a system that works you come up with a stupid gimmick like this and it's going to artificially inflate the cost and be stupid this game is on the Wii right?
7544212	7544973	Nope, PS3 and 360.
7545013	7545194	Wow.
7545294	7550822	I was going to say, because if it's not the Wii, it's another... There used to be stupid gimmicks over there.
7552244	7552565	I don't know.
7554975	7556235	It's just really weird to think about.
7557156	7564057	It's the unfortunate downside to Guitar Hero and Rock Band being very popular, and the Wii.
7564297	7575580	Actually, all three of those things getting popular roughly around all the same time has put this stigma out there that, wow, all these extra peripherals can sell like crazy!
7576480	7578102	I don't know.
7578542	7585950	Not that the power pad is ever really something to legitimize at all, but rather the power glove.
7586971	7590655	The power glove, the track and field mat, the...
7591876	7596598	Whatever that Sega Genesis controller, Beam, Octagon... Activator.
7597139	7598499	Wasn't it the Activator?
7598799	7599099	Yeah.
7599300	7600960	I had an Activator.
7601060	7602001	I know, they were awesome.
7602321	7604482	I just want to say, though, about the Power Pad.
7604562	7607463	The Power Pad was badass when I was a kid.
7607543	7608904	Because I was probably like...
7609544	7613745	I'm a little older than the rest of you, and I was probably like 9 or 10 when the Power Pad first came out.
7614305	7617446	We used to have a blast playing frickin' track meet.
7618967	7626689	Well, first off, I remember for the long jump, the trick was you jump off the pad and then jump back on so you can fly just like so far.
7627169	7630850	But also the other thing would be short order and eggsplode.
7631610	7632670	A game was awesome.
7633571	7635071	I have never heard of that.
7656078	7656719	Thanks for watching!
7676761	7681663	I'm actually kind of glad to see somebody talking about Prop Cycle.
7682023	7686525	That was a big, expensive rig, but that was a really good game.
7686545	7688006	I love Prop Cycle so much.
7688046	7689807	Prop Cycle gets props.
7691167	7691788	Look online.
7691808	7694889	Did you ever see the Prop Cycle that hooked up to an Addams Family pinball?
7697045	7698166	Trust me.
7698206	7698826	Just look it up.
7698846	7700648	What a pointless fucking combination.
7701848	7703850	It's brilliant and stupid at the same time.
7704170	7705191	Just look it up.
7706672	7708193	I'll find a link and put it in the chat room.
7708713	7709374	Sounds good to me.
7711095	7718320	DarkSakura, we need more content on the website and I'm thinking one thing you ought to do is a brilliant but stupid column and that should be something that you put in there.
7718701	7719421	Like in gaming.
7719481	7720642	Brilliant but stupid.
7722703	7723084	We'll see.
7724044	7725946	Jason, any other quick thoughts before we let you go, buddy?
7727250	7731392	The GTA 4 Lost in the Damned controversy you guys were talking about before.
7731872	7734053	The debate, I am so tired of it in general.
7734673	7738214	You know they did it just to see what would happen.
7738654	7741055	Of course you do, because they don't make every layer.
7742215	7745096	If you make a person, the texture is closed.
7745557	7751299	Here's the other thing, and I should have brought this up earlier in the show, because who knows how many people have actually listened this far two and a half hours into the show.
7751719	7752299	Here's the thing.
7753795	7758098	I bet they did it this way because the peen isn't really on the disc.
7758558	7759639	It's not in the game.
7760840	7762180	It's in the download content.
7762240	7773428	It's almost like the reverse of Hot Coffee where you had to hack the disc or whatever, basically use the little code to unlock the sex scene.
7774248	7776129	It's like the complete reverse of that.
7776250	7780472	I feel like they almost did this just like they knew This is the finger.
7780652	7783014	They knew in the beginning they wanted to put
7784403	7800335	the um peeing in the game but they thought no let's do it in the download content because then people who get mad and want to take this game off shelves well it's not really in the game you have to consciously pay to download or whatever a little weird Jason did you see the picture
7802190	7802991	No, I haven't.
7804132	7806594	I tend to stop clicking around and whatnot when I'm on a call.
7806795	7810218	We'll let you go so you can go check that out and post your things in chat.
7811379	7812480	Thanks for the call as always, Jason.
7813321	7816524	And thank you for my venting earlier when I couldn't get the podcast up.
7817125	7822129	People sometimes forget you're a big part of this show as well, even though it may not be your voice they have to hear for three hours every Sunday.
7822510	7824692	So how the hell would you play that game?
7825172	7825853	Alright, take care, Jason.
7826614	7826774	Night.
7828612	7830813	Codemasters wants you to name your baby Jason in the UK.
7855208	7855788	Thanks for watching!
7873820	7874580	Brilliant and stupid.
7874600	7875521	Not brilliant at all.
7875581	7876301	It's just stupid.
7876321	7877501	It's just stupid.
7878042	7884224	Now, if you name your kid Jason for other reasons, you know, you have a grandpa named Jason or you just like the name.
7884504	7885084	That's fine.
7885164	7886725	But if you name it Jason because of this.
7886745	7887685	Do it for Friday the 13th.
7888505	7888746	All right.
7888986	7890126	Look, we got another call on the line.
7890146	7890926	I don't want to keep them waiting.
7891226	7892327	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
7892347	7892747	Who's this?
7893427	7894087	Yo, what up, guys?
7894148	7895388	It's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.
7895428	7895868	How you doing?
7895928	7896708	Xenocore, how you doing?
7896728	7897649	We haven't heard from you in a while.
7897689	7899149	How are things going at Ultimate Quest?
7899169	7900490	We haven't heard from Footy in a while either.
7901365	7904827	Yeah, lots of real world stuff is kind of hitting us all at the moment.
7905227	7907007	I moved and got a new job.
7907068	7908308	Foodie's in the middle of finals.
7908328	7909489	You know, this, that, the other thing.
7910549	7913670	We are planning on coming back, but we've got to get our real lives in order first.
7913690	7919073	I was going to say, I think you've got Star Ocean this week, so you're going to need to get things together because that's a big RPG.
7919969	7920729	Yeah, that's true.
7921109	7921670	That's true.
7921910	7925971	But I've been focusing in other areas since I was cut off from the interwebs.
7926011	7928793	You know, you sort of need an internet connection to do the MMO thing.
7928993	7929153	True.
7929253	7937376	So I went back to some of my older conquests and dug up a copy of Falcon 4 after I heard Hendrick's mate mention it on his show the other day.
7938196	7944259	And on top of that, the new release of 40K Dawn of War 2 just came out.
7945151	7945811	Warhammer RTS Game
7964022	7964602	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7991317	7993039	Well, not so much now.
7993079	7996242	I mean, things are pretty well balanced.
7996322	8000927	It's just online you really have to pay attention to what you're doing because there is no base building in this.
8000987	8003470	Everything is done by putting your troops out in the field.
8004591	8010198	So where you position them and what areas they're looking in are a lot more important than what they used to be.
8010788	8011528	Thank you for watching!
8034810	8043233	Well, if you look at it, the guys who built Warhammer Mythic, I mean, they're known for their PvP stuff from Dark Age of Camelot.
8043913	8046434	And that's pretty much what this game is built towards.
8046694	8053917	So if you're not into it for the PvP, you may not want to last as long because there's only a 40-level cap.
8053957	8057798	The endgame comes a lot sooner, mainly to get you into PvP stuff.
8058219	8063861	So if going up against other players isn't your thing, then you're sort of going to get turned off from it after a while.
8065206	8070248	You run out of PvE content pretty quickly, or at least so I've heard from my friends who play it.
8070528	8070848	Interesting.
8070948	8076310	I was playing it for a little while, and it's not that I disliked the game, but at the time I was so sucked into WoW I couldn't balance two games.
8076350	8077051	So I had to cut one of those.
8077071	8078031	Oh, look, another public quest.
8078091	8079371	Oh, look, it's the same public quest.
8079431	8079812	Oh, no.
8080072	8082753	You know, I thought those public quests were actually a pretty neat idea.
8082993	8083833	Like, that was kind of cool.
8084393	8085774	It had some neat ideas.
8086254	8089615	That's why I'm a little sad to hear it's bleeding out users.
8089715	8093857	But, you know, at the same time, if not everybody's in it for PvP...
8094778	8098644	I don't think that it's going to go away, though.
8098664	8100486	I think it's going to stay above Critical Mass.
8100527	8109781	It'll just be one of those other ones that are just sitting quietly in the corner, like EverQuest and EverQuest 2 and Planetside and all these other classic ones that are still running.
8109961	8111242	Here's another game I played this week.
8111282	8116584	I didn't talk about my gaming week, but I actually went back and checked out Phantasy Star Universe for a little while, and you would be surprised.
8116644	8123546	On the Xbox 360, Block 1 and Block 2 are still full a lot of the times, especially during primetime gaming hours.
8123566	8132169	They still have... You would think that game would be completely dead, but they still have a very loyal user base in there, which was amazing because they still have Christmas decorations up.
8132990	8139012	Although I think they get away with it because they call it Winter something, so technically it's still Winter, but...
8140791	8141532	One other thing.
8142252	8149334	Did anybody in your area or anybody listening happen to get into the GameStop Street Fighter 4 competition that happened this weekend?
8149875	8150715	I did not go.
8150775	8151795	Did anybody in the room go?
8152575	8153156	I don't think so.
8153336	8158318	But we did have a caller just a little bit ago talk about his experience there in Southern California.
8158718	8159218	But did you go?
8160256	8162337	Yeah, there was one in Jacksonville, luckily enough.
8163117	8166818	I went in, got the round two, and I got my ass... Well, not handed to me.
8166838	8168319	It was a 3-2 victory for him.
8168619	8171060	But he's an old schooler like me, so I didn't feel too bad about it.
8171300	8172940	And he actually ended up winning the store.
8173281	8174941	So I was content with that.
8174961	8177542	Well, if you're going to lose to someone, lose to the eventual winner, I suppose.
8178282	8179363	Exactly, exactly.
8179823	8180463	That's what I felt like.
8180503	8185725	Back in the days of DDR, I don't know if a lot of people know, but I used to do Perfect Attack in DDR in tournaments and stuff, and
8186085	8195188	You know, like, I came in fourth, which was probably as high as I would go in some tournaments, but, you know, usually when I would lose, I would lose to the person who would eventually win, so it didn't feel so bad.
8196988	8197788	But those were the days.
8197988	8205650	Oh, man, I wish I could do some of that now, but now if I probably played a nine-footer on DDR, I'd be like, where's my inhaler?
8206811	8211452	So, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Xenocore, before we let you go?
8212478	8221206	Yeah, just that feeling of being in the tournament, everybody talking smack, all waiting for their turn and getting sent home crying.
8221666	8222947	I miss that from the arcades.
8223528	8224289	That needs to come back.
8224389	8225290	But that's pretty much it.
8225310	8226270	That's all I have, guys.
8226431	8226811	We'll see.
8226871	8228632	Maybe they'll do some more of this.
8228693	8229033	We'll see.
8229333	8229553	All right.
8229774	8231655	Well, Xenogor, take care, buddy, and have a good one.
8231675	8231995	Take it easy.
8232016	8232976	And good luck with Ultimate Quest.
8232996	8233437	Come back soon.
8235171	8241913	Alright, we're gonna go ahead and close the Skype line for now because we've taken lots and lots of calls tonight and we still have a cage match we gotta get to at some point.
8242314	8250556	And yeah, I heard one of our frequent listeners and callers, TheRobD, apparently did pretty well in this tournament.
8251177	8253197	I don't know if he won his store or runner-up or whatever.
8253217	8254618	Okay, what are you laughing about, DarkSakura?
8255066	8256207	Just the prop cycle.
8256667	8258148	Oh, you nerd.
8259008	8266053	Alright, so yeah, I was just reading about that in chat and it reminded me because I saw a live journal post of his that said that he did pretty well, so congrats to him.
8266813	8271056	And apparently he's got, he's like, I'm sure he's number one on my friends list and stuff online.
8271096	8272597	He's pretty insanely good at Street Fighter.
8272937	8275999	I have to play him once and lose to him just for the little factor.
8277360	8279541	Alright, Loki, any other last minute stories you want to get to?
8280185	8287251	Yeah, it's rumored that, or I guess Sony is saying God of War 3 and MAG are coming within the year.
8287271	8294596	Of course, MAG being that massive action game, and these will be like blockbuster exclusives.
8296218	8301762	And yeah, no word on when they're possibly going to come, although if I were a guessing man...
8304039	8307921	Perhaps God of War 3 might be coming out around July-ish.
8308801	8309542	But we don't know.
8309922	8312063	So, it's just a guess.
8312423	8313684	Summer's a good time to release games.
8314744	8315564	July, especially.
8315584	8320427	There's, what, NCAA football and NCAA football.
8321072	8321572	That's about it.
8322133	8322834	At least for July.
8324575	8327338	Well, Braid, we talked about that earlier in the show.
8328639	8332162	And if you thought $15 was too much for Braid, well, you're in luck.
8332222	8336706	They're dropping the price this week to 800 Microsoft points or $10.
8336927	8339849	Great for sales.
8339949	8342732	If you haven't played it yet, you get a chance to play it now.
8343332	8344534	I had a story, too.
8345735	8347016	Oh, well, DarkSakura, go ahead.
8348308	8349049	Just jump right in there.
8349089	8349689	Cut Loki off.
8350470	8351511	He does it to me all the time.
8351531	8352171	I thought it was fair.
8353032	8353372	I'm kidding.
8353392	8354033	Go ahead with your story.
8354073	8356154	I was actually just trying to remind you that I had one later.
8357115	8362980	Apparently Microsoft overpaid some layoff severances and now they want their money back.
8363681	8364581	I guess in...
8368044	8383151	In an administrative error, they had meant to pay off their 1,400 employees that they had just recently laid off, but they actually had put a little bit too much money in their severance packages.
8384071	8392315	They now want it back and says, according to this, we ask that you repay the overpayment and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience to you.
8392495	8394536	Yeah, I know it's just a minor inconvenience.
8395236	8396557	That's kind of messed up.
8396957	8397337	I don't know.
8398715	8400617	Alright, you know what's funny?
8401497	8403259	I actually had something like that happen to me once.
8403279	8405561	I don't want to say at what job, it was a long, long time ago.
8405661	8407383	Long, long time ago, like I was younger.
8407883	8410025	And they totally overpaid me on my last check.
8410045	8412067	And not by much, but like a hundred bucks.
8412527	8414228	But when you're like 18, that's a lot of money.
8414689	8419053	So, you know, thankfully they didn't ask for it back.
8419073	8421255	Because at that age, I don't know how I would have paid that back.
8422509	8423951	So, anyhow.
8424713	8427557	Alright, Jamie, why don't you go ahead and do your last minute story?
8427697	8428759	It's a little dumb story.
8428799	8429400	Sure, go for it.
8429420	8437573	It was actually, it was not dumb because it was linked to me from Alpha Cananogram in chat that they're selling Noby Noby Boy shirts.
8438453	8439614	at Panic.com
8466806	8467607	Let me look at that right now.
8467647	8473190	This is at panic.com slash goods slash nobynoby.php Free advertising for them.
8473230	8473611	Look at that.
8473771	8474191	Oh, wow.
8474271	8474611	I see.
8475712	8476432	They're hilarious.
8476452	8478854	They look like a giant scribble on a shirt.
8479254	8480115	They're hilarious.
8481425	8482265	Loki, do you have any more?
8503597	8505258	I think that's it for right now.
8528834	8531856	and it would boot Xbox Live people off of the network actually.
8532696	8537699	Microsoft has responded saying that basically you should contact your internet provider if this is happening to you.
8538079	8542162	However, they are threatening to ban any hacker that gets involved in it.
8542702	8546384	Quote, this problem is not related to the Xbox Live service but to the player's internet connection.
8546784	8552268	The attacker could also attempt to disrupt other internet activities such as streaming video or web browsing using the same tool.
8552788	8556931	And Microsoft just kind of wants to remind people that, hey, Xbox Live is like any other internet service.
8557271	8567678	So if somebody is attempting to hack you in that regard, or I guess more like spam you, I think would be a more appropriate term, it could affect Xbox Live just like it would affect anything else you do on the internet.
8567918	8568599	So be warned.
8569620	8573906	And if you're doing that to people, unless they really deserve it, you're lame.
8574366	8577110	If you're doing it to people just randomly, then you're lame.
8577190	8580194	But if you're doing it to people because they really deserve it, then okay.
8581355	8582176	But just be careful.
8582437	8584700	Apparently they're doing it to people because they lose to them.
8585240	8586080	Oh, see, that's lame.
8586860	8587401	Get over it.
8587561	8588061	You've lost.
8588561	8589141	I don't like you.
8589301	8591602	I'm going to DDoS you.
8591702	8592482	QQ some more.
8592842	8593482	Cry me a river.
8594242	8596623	Die in a fire if that's you.
8597443	8598864	Why are you playing games online?
8599304	8602385	If you can't handle losing, don't play games online.
8602625	8603845	Why else do people play games?
8604125	8605185	To piss other people off.
8605265	8608846	I fucking hope Seth, for real, comes into your house and beats you up.
8609326	8611207	That's what I hope for those people.
8612403	8619444	Alright, if that's it for the last minute stories, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the evening and wrap up the show for tonight.
8619464	8621625	We can get to the live afterbirth.
8623285	8625106	Drew, thank you for being here tonight.
8625226	8626646	I'm sorry you didn't get to say more on the show.
8627026	8628126	And happy Pi Day.
8628466	8634928	You guys brought pie and we'll probably enjoy it during the afterbirth, although I don't know if we have a lot of forks, but I can't have any, but you guys can all have some.
8635248	8638949	It is episode 314 or Pi Day, so happy Pi Day.
8640069	8640829	Drew, any final thoughts?
8643686	8646049	Kim, thank you for being here and I hope you feel better.
8646429	8648791	Take drugs.
8648851	8649472	Lots of drugs.
8649532	8650954	And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8652155	8653116	I hope you guys enjoy the pie.
8653717	8654637	Alright, we do.
8654998	8655618	Punch and pie.
8656019	8658642	I don't have punch but I have apple juice so it'll be juice and pie.
8659670	8659910	All right.
8661130	8662531	Joe, thank you for being here.
8662591	8665472	DarkTetsuya, thank you as always for your contributions to the website.
8665592	8669213	And a lot of folks don't know, but you actually contribute a lot of the stories to the show every week.
8669273	8670213	So thank you for being here.
8670513	8670833	Of course.
8671154	8672234	And do you have any final thoughts?
8672714	8674355	I hear you're popular on the Internet.
8674515	8675555	I'm popular on the Internet.
8675575	8677496	Yes, I am popular on the Internet, you bastard.
8678036	8678496	All right.
8678716	8680797	Loki, what's your final thought for tonight?
8682877	8688359	Final thought is I need to play more Noby Noby voice now that I actually know what I'm supposed to be doing in it.
8689198	8694611	Although, my only complaint, that camera fucking sucks in Noby Noby Boy.
8694892	8695393	Poop more.
8696296	8697879	I do need to poop more in that game.
8700610	8703231	DarkSakura, last but not least
8729571	8730132	Your final thought.
8734761	8734902	No.
8736224	8737266	No is your final thought.
8737787	8738368	No means no.
8739426	8739726	All right.
8739786	8743229	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8743490	8744851	We really appreciate it.
8744991	8745471	It's true.
8745551	8746512	This isn't just a line.
8746893	8751637	Without you guys, we wouldn't exist because it's all about independent podcasts.
8751657	8754479	So if you enjoy what you hear, all you have to do, help us spread the word.
8754559	8755780	Tell two people about the show.
8756161	8757722	Leave us a nice review on iTunes.
8757762	8758503	Help us spread the word.
8758523	8759263	That's all we ask.
8759363	8761445	We don't put advertising in the show or any of that stuff.
8761545	8764448	We just give up our time on Sunday nights because we like it.
8764788	8766469	It's fun, and we like attention.
8767150	8769232	and we like to be popular on the internet, right Joe?
8769853	8770153	Alright.
8771114	8771615	So that's it.
8772135	8773657	Thank you guys so much for listening to us tonight.

8816369	8818551	I'm going to do something we don't usually do in the afterbirth here.
8818571	8822233	I'm going to make an outbound call because I saw someone join chat and I want to talk to him.
8822253	8824094	Maybe I'll leave this in the podcast for fun.
8824415	8830759	Usually we do a little live only thing after the show and play some copyrighted music, but tonight we'll do something special.
8831139	8831760	Hi, Rob.
8831940	8832460	It's Rob.
8833561	8833781	Hi.
8833961	8834161	Hi.
8834241	8834662	How are you?
8836025	8838987	A little bit surprised that this is the first time Orange Lounge Radio has called me.
8839087	8842368	Yes, it doesn't happen very often, but I saw you join chat.
8842408	8844569	You had incredible timing in joining chat.
8844609	8846590	And my first thought was, were your ears burning?
8846630	8847931	Because we were just talking about you.
8848752	8850313	Street Fighter IV Tournament
8871341	8872562	I moved on to the second round.
8872682	8875204	I've got that little blue sheet that says KO first round.
8875224	8877385	You get to go to the second round, so yay me.
8877985	8882008	Does that mean you won the store, or did the top three get to go, or what?
8883429	8884109	Well, here's what happened.
8884149	8889893	I actually lost in the winner's bracket to the guy who eventually won it.
8890693	8895697	Then I won the loser's bracket, faced him again in the grand final, so to speak, and lost to him again.
8896117	8897758	The sad thing is I won three rounds every time.
8898466	8900128	I was gonna ask who your character of choice is.
8900149	8900649	So it's Ryu, is your guy?
8915693	8916373	Let me put it this way.
8916393	8919134	My aim screen name is RyuRobD, so yes.
8921234	8921695	Very nice.
8921775	8922055	All right.
8922435	8923535	See, I don't know what it is.
8923615	8925355	I'm trying to feel out different characters.
8925615	8927936	Back in the day, I used to be Chun-Li.
8929176	8932557	You know I love Chun-Li, and that was the one I used to use all the time.
8932597	8940099	But now, after Super Street Fighter 2 and everything, I think I really like Fei Long, especially after playing him in Street Fighter 4.
8940339	8940919	But here's the thing.
8940999	8943680	I am so challenged by the controls.
8944500	8950024	in freaking, you know, the Xbox 360, because it's really hard on that little D-pad to do three fireballs all in a row.
8950864	8956388	So I was going to actually ask you next, how do you get around the control issue, or have you stuck it out with the D-pad?
8956428	8957689	Did you have to use the D-pad in the tournament?
8957709	8958649	I've stuck it out with the D-pad.
8958669	8959870	I'm really used to it at this point.
8960911	8966054	It really has calloused my thumb entirely, but I'm used to it at this point, so I can actually do pretty much anything.
8966074	8968636	I can do even Zangief's Spitting Pilot Driver.
8970016	8971698	The double quarter circle forward motions are still...
8972819	8973039	Wow.
8989432	8991333	All of the opponent is flying up in the air and coming down.
8991373	8993013	You just fucking lost me, but that's all right.
8994574	8998775	I'm assuming that's just massive death right there, some type of massive death.
8998795	9000576	Pretty much.
9001776	9002097	All right.
9002137	9002977	Well, hey, you know what?
9002997	9003897	Congratulations to you.
9003937	9004597	That's pretty awesome.
9004617	9005358	Thank you very much.
9005378	9010680	And I wanted to hear about the whole how it went because we had a couple people calling in saying, yeah, I lost, yeah, I lost.
9011160	9012460	So, well, good luck in round two.
9012480	9014621	Are you going to be able to make it out there for round two, you think?
9015633	9016013	Probably.
9016073	9021815	I have a couple people saying that they'll actually drive me, which, as a poor college student with no car, is a good thing.
9022415	9039640	Actually, the funniest story I heard about the tournament this weekend is, this could just be someone bullshitting on an internet message board, but supposedly someone was at a tournament and he's like, oh, we're just in some small little town, this will be easy to win, and then all of a sudden they're like, okay, first round we've got Justin Wong, can he come to Station A?
9040419	9044081	And if you don't know who he is, he's a famous Marvel vs. Capcom 2 player.
9044161	9045862	I think even I've heard that name.
9046242	9047783	Even I've heard that name.
9047843	9051666	We used to have an arcade here in Folsom that did huge Capcom events.
9051766	9055388	We had a DDR tournament there years ago and it was still open.
9055988	9056649	That is funny.
9058210	9059951	How unlucky do you have to be, really?
9060731	9061111	How funny.
9061812	9065054	Hey, one other question I want to ask you, since you're the best Street Fighter 4 player I know.
9067055	9067375	Thank you.
9067775	9069796	We don't have a lot on the show.
9070857	9078882	My question is, what are some tips for those of us that consistently get our ass kicked by Seth, who suck at the game, any advice for us to get better?
9079883	9085486	Certainly stay out of throw range when he wakes up, because what he likes to do is do that stupid Shoryuken spinning pile driver move, so
9086058	9088279	Staying a couple steps away from him when he wakes up would help a lot.
9089579	9094721	Really wait for him to make a move and then sweep him because the computer is very vulnerable to that, especially on the easier difficulties.
9096342	9097903	Really just use your safest moves against him.
9098183	9101544	Any tips for online in the non-Seth type battles?
9102565	9110748	Online, for the Ryu players, let them make mistakes because they're usually aggressive and most of them can't even shore Yuken, so they're vulnerable to air attacks.
9110808	9113209	Most of their game usually revolves around just
9114284	9114964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9138037	9139078	Yeah, she's interesting.
9139198	9141900	I like how she resembles Vanessa a lot from King of Fighters.
9141960	9145983	I have no idea if you... I'm telling you, does she not look like an SNK character?
9146103	9147564	We were talking about this at the beginning of the show.
9148224	9150766	She absolutely does, especially since she's got the red hair.
9150826	9153227	She's a special agent type character, that sort of thing.
9153448	9155309	It's funny for her, I think, but hey.
9156310	9156550	All right.
9156990	9162013	All right, well, Rob, we're going to let you go and get to the rest of our after show or actually close the podcast at this point.
9162053	9165856	So thank you very much for letting us harass you and surprising you with a phone call and telling us about your experience.
9166482	9167003	Always a pleasure.
9167084	9167725	Have a good night, guys.
9168086	9170632	Take care, Rob.
9171033	9172717	Now the podcast is really over.
9173058	9173379	Good night.
