0	19960	Tonight, February 22nd, 2009, a new American McGee's Alice is announced, DSI and Rhythm
19960	29960	Heaven get release dates, and will we soon be seeing more red on Xbox 360 elites?
29960	36360	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
36360	41260	Radio. We are that show that broadcasts live every week on AllGames.com, Sunday nights
41260	47000	dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name
47000	51000	is Rob Roberts, I'm here with you every week, as well as the one and only, Dark Sakura,
51000	52000	Jamie Summers.
52000	53000	Hack.
53000	54000	How are you doing?
54000	55000	Hack.
55000	56000	Hack, cough, die?
56000	57000	Yes.
57000	61000	What are tonight's Oscars, which we're competing against, apparently?
61000	63000	Um, fart.
63000	71000	Okay, fart, the motion picture, for best picture. Also say hello to tech master, Loki, who's
71000	73320	chowing down on a sandwich over there. How you doing?
73320	75320	It's not a sandwich, it's a burger.
75320	78320	Oh, a burger, sorry. You guys are making me hungry, I haven't eaten dinner yet.
78320	79320	Okay, fine.
79320	81320	Alright, good, good. Any predictions for tonight's Oscars?
81320	84320	Slumdog Millionaire is gonna win.
84320	89320	Yeah, I think it's gonna be pretty anti-climatic in that way, but, you know, it's funny, having
89320	93320	done this show on Sunday nights for the past, you know, what, seven years almost, this is
93320	97820	like the fifth year or sixth year in a row, we're not able to watch the Oscars, so you
97820	99320	kinda get to a point where you don't care anymore.
99320	100320	I don't care.
100320	106720	It's just an awards show, it's just another thing for people to, you know, pat each other
106720	110920	on the back, whatever, and then charge millions and millions of dollars of advertising for
110920	111920	it, so whatevers.
111920	116520	Anyhow, let's get to a more important topic, and that is video games.
116520	117520	Games.
117520	120920	Or dark soccer, fine, we'll do both, dark soccer and video games. We'll always start
120920	124420	off the show with how was your gaming week. So dark soccer, tell us a little bit about
124420	126120	your gaming week.
126120	133020	My gaming week was fantabulously uneventful, but hey, I did actually play stuff. I played
133020	140560	some City of Heroes and more like made a whole bunch of costumes because it was fun, and
140560	146020	I, actually Dan and I were watching videos last night comparing the different versions
146020	151680	of, you know, the Oendon games and Elite Beat agents, and then we watched Wall Street Fighter,
151680	155280	which is probably the most hilarious and wrong thing I've ever seen on the internet in my
155280	159400	entire life this week.
159400	167240	Also played some more Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game. I need to actually go back
167240	171200	and work on my Symphony of the Night game since I've started it and got like to one
171200	174880	save point and was like, haha, going to bed.
174880	182940	Also, did some thinking about doing tabletop gaming and then went meh, so that's really
182940	187200	about it for my gaming week. What about you, Loki?
187200	195920	I played Eat the Burger. No, actually, I played a few things this week. Mainly Lost in the
195920	202840	Damned, or Lost and Damned. I just wanted to add the other the in there. The new Grand
202840	209680	Theft Auto expansion is pretty cool. It's short. I don't know, I kind of like the style
209680	216960	of it more gritty. Some of the things that they've changed are good, some not so good.
216960	221880	Especially with the multiplayer. For one, the helicopters, they really tweak. They gave
221880	228760	the helicopters explosive rounds and they made them like, fragile. So you run into one
228760	233360	little thing and your helicopter is on fire already. But, because they have explosive
233360	239080	rounds, you can blow up a car and people really quick. So that's kind of annoying that they
239080	244080	had to go and tweak all that. They really did the explosive rounds for that chopper
244080	249200	versus chopper online mode, which is alright, I guess. But, you know, they could have just
249200	255800	limited the explosive rounds to that mode instead of, you know, fucking everything up.
255800	258960	Then they did some other stuff that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Now they have different
258960	264600	preferences where you have to set your preferences on your phone before you can actually go into
264600	271800	an online game. Say, for example, you're hosting one. Your preferences for auto-aim, for the
271800	279440	cops, and for, well, if you're doing free mode, friendly fire on or off are locked into
279440	284760	whatever your preferences are. You can't change it on there, which is really retarded. I understand
284760	289480	why they did it for, you know, if you're searching for a game. But as far as hosting a game,
289480	292680	you should be able to change those options without having to back out of everything and
292680	297320	it's really retarded and caught us off guard with that kind of stuff. And, for free mode,
297320	301920	they took out the helicopters. There's no fucking helicopters for no reason whatsoever.
301920	307180	So that makes no sense at all. I don't know why they did that, so it just complicates
307180	312400	things even more. It's just, why are you taking out options instead of putting, you know,
312400	316680	options back in or putting additional options? Now, granted, you don't have to play these
316680	321880	options on. It's only if you're playing The Lost and the Damned. But, I mean, it's still
321880	329800	annoying. There's no reason to take the helicopters out. At all. But other than that, it's pretty
329800	333600	fun. So, you know, what we normally do at lunch, you know, me and my friend, we just
333600	337320	kind of shoot each other with the helicopters anyway, so we just play a deathmatch instead
337320	343840	of free mode. Big deal, it's the same thing. So, that's fine. But, you know, the game itself
343840	349200	is pretty fun and, you know, we'll be getting into a little bit more of it. There's some
349200	357200	stuff they did for controversy that I don't get it and it's stupid but whatever. But yeah,
357200	360920	it's kind of fun. But, sadly enough, I've only spent a few hours on it and I'm already
360920	365680	almost done with it, so. Do you think overall it was worth the money that you have to pay
365680	372040	for it? Yeah, it was enough. I got it for five systems, so. It was like pretty much
372040	375560	buying a new game, wasn't it? How much is it? About fifteen bucks? Twenty bucks each.
375560	379800	Twenty bucks, whew. I had store credit, so. Well, at least that's something. No actual
379800	386720	money was being spent. That's good. And then, other than that, I also played Noby Noby Boy
386720	394040	or like I'd refer it to Baby's First Tapeworm. Basically, this game, I haven't really figured
394040	399480	out, I mean, obviously the point is to stretch as far as possible. I don't know how you do
399480	403880	that, if you eat things. From what I found, eating things didn't really seem to do anything,
403880	410600	but hey, maybe it does and I just don't notice it. But, basically, you're this kind of weird
410600	416400	tube-like creature that looks like it could have been straight out of, you know, I don't
416400	422400	know, just, of course, the Katamari universe and then everything that's pretty much in
422400	429560	this looks like it's straight out of the Katamari universe. I don't know, it's a weird game.
429560	433280	You kind of get bored with it after a while, but I've been trying to stretch my character
433280	437640	out. I've gotten to the point where I'm so long that I actually, if I stretch out up
437640	443160	or down, it'll go so far that it thinks I've fallen to my death, which, you know, you can't
443160	448040	really die in the game, you just kind of pop back out of your chimney. But, you can eat
448040	454300	things and then you'll poop them out. And it's funny, because stuff will explode out
454300	458720	of your ass. Let's get some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
458720	462000	You can always join us when we tape live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard
462000	467280	Time, 9 o'clock Eastern Time. We got Biohaze starting us off tonight, making some comments
467280	471120	on Grand Theft Auto 4. They took out Helis, I didn't know that, I haven't explored much
471120	476720	anyway. It was worth it, especially that grenade launcher drool. The grenade launcher was kind
476720	484200	of crap, but the auto shotgun's pretty sweet. But yeah, they took out helicopters out of
484200	488320	free mode, only free mode though, so that doesn't make any sense. I don't get it. Comment
488320	494080	from Tigerclaw, so Noby Noby Boy is like Snake, you get bigger as you eat stuff. Well, I don't
494080	498600	know if that's the case, you just stretch. You have to like, kind of, um... Wouldn't
498600	503000	stretch imply getting big? Yes, you stretch by getting bigger, but it's not necessarily
503000	507840	eating things. You basically stretch out. I don't know if it's eating things that does
507840	512320	anything. I don't even know what the eating things part does. But I've just been stretching
512320	517000	by like, you know, tying myself around things and just kind of, you know. And it's weird
517000	521280	though too, if you stretch too much, you'll break in half. Which is weird, because that
521280	524800	caught me off guard. I'm like, what the hell, my guy just broke in half. But luckily if
524800	530520	you hold the triangle button down, you'll spawn back into your house, and you'll be
530520	535320	all one piece again. So I couldn't figure out, once I split in two, how to actually,
535320	541280	you know, connect myself again. I tried eating myself, but that didn't work. And then, kind
541280	548280	of along the same lines, I played a Flash game called Don't Shit Your Pants. What? Please
549280	555200	explain. You're a guy standing there, and you have to take a shit, and you have to not
555200	559800	shit your pants. It's a text adventure game. And basically you type in what you need him
559800	566800	to do. You have to tell him to take off your pants, pull door to bathroom. Where did you
566800	572040	find this game? You have him take off his pants before he opens the door to the bathroom.
572040	576160	Well you can do it. Have you played this too? No. You can do it in any order, but yes, that's
576160	582000	what you have to do. Take out pants, take off pants, pee, go in the bathroom. But you
582000	587440	can like, you know, you can shit on the ground. The basic object of the game is not to shit
587440	592320	your pants, but you can shit on the ground, shit in the toilet. They have ten different
592320	599320	achievements for different things you can do. It's interesting. But yeah, that's pretty
601520	608520	much my gaming week. Awesome. You know, what is it though with, did you find this game,
610800	615160	because I noticed kind of a theme on PlayStation Network recently that a lot of their big games
615160	618920	don't give you much explanation on what the hell to do with them. No, I didn't know what
618920	622800	the hell I was supposed to do in that. It gave you nothing? It says there's no objective
622800	629800	whatsoever, but like, you see the girl stretching out in the space, but you don't see how close
630480	636080	she is to another planet or something like that, because she's just really fucking far
636080	641240	out there. Has she hit the moon yet? She's probably gone beyond the moon, but the only
641240	647480	planet you can play is Earth. And you can kind of generate new maps and stuff, but they're
647480	651560	all kind of the same, and I didn't really get it, what I was supposed to be doing. If
651560	657560	I was supposed to be eating stuff, or you know, what? Because I'd eat stuff and I'd
657560	662920	kind of travel through my body like a snake, and then after a while, once I filled up,
662920	668720	and I clenched down too much on my back end, it would poop it out with a nice fart. It's
668720	675720	funny seeing people getting farted out, you know, single people at a time, and cats. I'll
675720	681840	play it during the break. Alright, alright, I'll check it out. Let's see, I also played
681840	685360	a pretty big release on the PlayStation Network this week that also gives you very little
685360	689720	explanation on what the hell you're supposed to do. It's called Flower. Flower, I'd honestly
689720	694280	best describe it. Honestly, it's a racing game, in my opinion. It's a very, very different
694280	698240	type of racing game, but it's kind of a racing game. I don't know, maybe that's not the fairest
698240	703400	way to describe it, but you certainly have an acceleration button, and you tilt to control
703400	708440	it, but it's more of like a free reign thing. Basically, what you're trying to do, it's
708440	711920	difficult to describe this game because there's no real demo for it, and the trailer doesn't
711920	716960	give you an exact sense of what to expect from this game, but basically you start as
716960	721640	a flower petal, and you travel through using the wind to accelerate and tilt, basically
721640	724960	like you're controlling a car. I mean, they say you're using the wind and all this stuff,
724960	729060	but basically you're controlling the flower petal like it's a car. You expand other flowers
729060	733760	and collect their petals. So suddenly you're this giant stream of petals, but what you're
733760	737600	trying to do is you're trying to, if you can unlock the flowers in certain patterns, then
737600	743380	it causes the terrain to shift, like it might cause the wind to kick up and a cliff of rocks
743380	747380	will topple over or something, so you have a new place to go. And it seems like in every
747380	752160	stage, it adds a new element to it. Like in stage five, I think it is, there's electrical
752160	756120	poles you don't want to touch or you get scarred. I don't know if you lose petals or what have
756120	763320	you, but they're basically bad things. In one stage, you basically leave light trails
763320	767700	wherever you go, and certain areas you want to paint with light, essentially, to get to
767700	770840	the next area. You know, that being said, although this game sounds very kind of like
770840	775820	artsy in design, it is. I mean, this game is beautiful. It's one of the most beautiful
775820	780420	games I've played in a long time. I mean, it really does, especially in the high definition
780420	785800	on the PlayStation 3, it really just looks like a painting in motion. I mean, this game
785800	791200	almost seems like somebody sat there and said, you know, how can we show those assholes that
791200	797340	say games are not art? What can we do to prove them wrong? And it seems like this game is
797340	803340	almost like a byproduct of that. But, boy, the game is just gorgeous. I mean, especially
803340	806920	when I was playing the night stage, which was like the fourth stage, it's a stage that
806920	810560	takes place completely at night and you're basically painting with lights and everything.
810560	813760	It's just, oh my gosh, the game is just beautiful. It's one of the most beautiful games I've
813760	819480	played in a long time. For a download title, that's pretty impressive. So I really enjoy
819480	823420	the graphics in the game. And, you know, although the game is a little simple, it's not going
823420	828880	to take your whole day to beat it. I would say you can get through all six stages in
828880	835960	about two hours tops, maybe three, I don't know. The game does leave some elements to
835960	840980	be explored, such as there are secret pedals that you can find in stages. There are secret
840980	844820	areas to go in in different stages. I mean, the game is very open. It doesn't give you
844820	848720	a lot of description as to what you're supposed to do in the game, so there is a lot of exploration.
848720	852760	That's a very big element. There's really a seventh stage, too, that's the credits,
852760	856640	which plays slightly differently in which when you're exploding the flowers, basically,
856640	859960	you're also collecting the letters of the staff in the game, which is kind of a cute
859960	867440	idea. You know, and the trophies are, they're challenging, but not that challenging. You
867440	872040	know what I mean? So it's pretty easy trophies, but will take a little of your time to get.
872040	878960	All in all, I think it's a pretty good title for download. And $10 is a fair price, considering
878960	882420	it's, you know, just the sheer beauty of the game, and I think it's something that's very
882420	886720	easy to pick up. You use the X button, and you use six axis to play the game. That's
886720	891040	it. You tilt the six axis to move, which doesn't play as bad as you might think, and you use
891040	893880	the X to accelerate. That's it. That's basically the controls.
893880	899640	That's the controls for Flow. Which was their other game. The same developers who made Flow.
899640	903960	There's actually a Flow reference in the game, and one of the trophies you collect is Flow.
903960	909200	A Flow trophy or whatever. So, yeah, I enjoyed Flower. I would say pick it up. I could see
909200	912720	that they're probably going to expand this game later on, maybe with some extra stages
912720	916500	and things, and I think that would be okay. I do think they need to put a demo out for
916500	921160	it, so that people can really understand what it's about, but I understand because the game
921160	925040	is a bit short. That's my biggest complaint about Flower is that it is a bit short, but
925040	931060	I think, you know, ten dollars for an experience that I think most everybody in your house
931060	935720	will kind of get a kick out of. You know, literally anybody can pick up this game and
935720	940880	play. I think it's worth it. It's pretty cool. So, yeah, I do recommend Flower.
940880	945680	Also, a big part of my gaming week was taken up by Street Fighter IV, which I picked up
945680	949800	on the Xbox 360 as opposed to the Playstation 3. You know, I had decided last week I'm going
949800	954080	to buy this on the Playstation 3 because I have Playstation 3 hooked up with HDMI, so
954080	961120	my games look that slight bit better. It's hardly noticeable, though, and better controls.
961120	965040	But then when I walked into the store, I was like, eh, you know what, achievements, more
965040	968920	people I know on Xbox Live, I'm just going to get it on 360. So I did. I bought it on
968920	975400	360. And the controls aren't terrible, but it is difficult, especially with some of those
975400	980360	characters that really rely on rolling motions for their moves. For instance, one character
980360	984800	I love to play is Fei Long. I think he's an awesome character. I love his moves. I love
984800	989440	his fighting style. I like playing, I loved him in Super Street Fighter II. Turbo, I like
989440	995280	playing him now. However, one of his special moves is basically, if you've not played him
995280	999960	before, is basically three fireballs all in a row. If you want to do this ya ya ya thing
999960	1005920	all in a row, you have to do like three fireballs very quickly. And it's hard to do on the Xbox
1005920	1011000	360 original controller. Very hard to do. It almost makes me think I'm going to need
1011000	1015260	to pick up an arcade joystick if I'm really going to want to be able to be any good at
1015260	1019000	this game, especially online. When I play characters like Chun Li, I don't have a problem
1019000	1023920	at all, because most of Chun Li's moves are back and forth, or up to down, or back to
1023920	1033120	forth. So, that's, you know, that's easy on the Xbox 360 stick. And I'm looking at
1033120	1037680	chatroom, chat.orangelandradio.com, and Gunstar in chat says, get an arcade stick, Rob. And
1037680	1042400	I'm thinking... Hey! Is that your husband? I think so. It might be. I know that's the
1042400	1047500	name he'd use. You know, I might need to invest the money to get it. But the question, here's
1047500	1054640	the question. Do I love Street Fighter IV that much? And I, granted, I could get use
1054640	1058080	out of this on other fighting games I play. Like, Soul Calibur IV is pretty awesome. I'm
1058080	1062780	sure there'll be, like, maybe I'll enjoy Super Street Fighter II Turbo Super Edition
1062780	1069560	High Def a little more if I actually got an arcade stick. But, yeah, I don't know. That's
1069560	1073260	a lot of money to drop on a controller. And I'm just worried I won't be playing this
1073260	1078360	game that long. Some very obvious modes. I think we're left out of the game, which is
1078360	1083520	a disappointment. I think it's kind of cool that you can turn on the mode where you, like,
1083520	1087840	seek other players while you're playing arcade mode, basically. And you might, like, it gives
1087840	1092440	that old, very old-fashioned feel of somebody walking up to the arcade game and just dropping
1092440	1095760	a quarter in and challenging you. Which I think that was a really kind of neat mode
1095760	1099920	to put in there, that you could always be seeking a player match or a battle match.
1099920	1103000	Granted, if you're going to turn that mode on, you can expect you're always going to
1103000	1106800	get challenged. At least right now. Probably after this game ages a few months, it'll get
1106800	1112200	a little less. However, one mode they're missing, being able to set that to friends only is
1112200	1116600	something I would really think would be an obvious mode that they did not choose to enable.
1116600	1122080	Like, I would love to play with that mode on if only my friends could challenge me because,
1122080	1124480	you know, and you might be thinking, well, why do you want to set it that way, Rob? Because
1124480	1130800	I like to play with friends on Xbox Live more than I do random a-holes that sometimes, you
1130800	1134480	know, I don't really want to play with. And Tiger Girl House says I have it turned off.
1134480	1139560	I do most of the time, too. I spend most of my time with it turned off as well. But it
1139560	1143080	would be cool. I would probably leave it on more often if friends could just walk up and
1143080	1148800	challenge me. So. But yeah, for that reason, I choose not to leave it on.
1148800	1153080	Otherwise, I think there's a lot of cool stuff in the game. I like that there's the challenge
1153080	1157160	mode and the time attack mode and survival mode that all have, you know, they start off
1157160	1162040	really easy. I mean, if you want to talk about an easy mode, something easier than easiest,
1162040	1167280	go play, like, the first time attack mode where you basically have your super bars are
1167280	1173000	always filled up. Go play that mode. That's super, super easy. I think it's really cute
1173000	1180000	having the icons and the titles that are kind of separate from Xbox Live. So, yeah. It's
1180000	1187080	a fun fighting game. $60, though? It's a lot of money to pay. And this whole accessibility,
1187080	1190680	you know, I think the game is accessible if you've played Street Fighter II before. You
1190680	1193760	know, I know it's been taking a little bit of crap for not being as accessible as they
1193760	1199120	say it is in regards to the difficulty. And I'm not going to lie to you. Seth is a cheap
1199120	1205380	bitch. He sucks, even on easiest mode. Sucks a lot. And some of the opponents start to
1205380	1208280	really suck, too, when you get up there, even in, like, you know, medium and some of those
1208280	1215660	other modes. However, what I loved about it is that I haven't really played a Street Fighter
1215660	1220440	game hardcore since Super Street Fighter II Turbo. You know, there was a period of time
1220440	1224080	where I didn't play a lot of video games, and it was mostly during college. Like, the
1224080	1227840	only games I played were, like, Final Fantasy VII and Puzzle Fighter. And that was the period
1227840	1234120	of time when we got Street Fighter III, Street Fighter Alpha, Capcom SNK, Marvel Capcom. You
1234120	1238960	know, all those games kind of came out in that Dreamcast era that I kind of didn't play
1238960	1244400	a lot of games through. And so, for me, I didn't play a lot of those games. I was able
1244400	1249400	to pick up Street Fighter IV no problem. No problem. Because the moves are pretty much
1249400	1256560	the same. So, yeah, I had a good time with the game. $60, though, that's a lot to ask
1256560	1262420	for somebody, you know, that's based on nostalgia only. I would honestly recommend you play
1262420	1266600	it at a friend's house first before you drop that kind of money. If you envision that this
1266600	1272040	is a game you would play online a lot, if you are a fighting game fan at all, then definitely
1272040	1276320	Street Fighter IV needs to be in your collection. But if you're, like, a casual fighting game
1276320	1280640	fan like me, you're not so sure, you might want to rent or play it at a friend's house
1280640	1287000	first. Just because of the controls and the longevity of the game for $60, which is a
1287000	1292840	lot of money in this day and age. So. But overall, I would give the game a good review.
1292840	1297520	As you would, too, right, DarkSakura? Give it a good review. Yeah, I like it. Yeah. Alright.
1297520	1302000	Awesome. Looking at some comments in chatroom, Gunstar says, Seth is the worst last boss
1302000	1309360	in the history of last bosses. And SSJ100Matt says, Seth isn't as bad as Gil. So. I do have
1309360	1315080	to admit that Gil's a bastard. They're all bastards. Alright, that's going to do it for
1315080	1318740	my gaming week. I don't want to go on forever. We have some news we want to get to tonight.
1318740	1323140	Let's get to some housekeeping. And there isn't a lot right now, I do want to point
1323140	1327960	out at Orangelaunchradio.com, very cool new feature where our podcasts, when we get them
1327960	1332240	to the feed, which by the way, I got caught up tonight. There's one more waiting to go
1332240	1335880	to the feed and it'll be all caught up. They show up, I think, on the front page of the
1335880	1340880	feed when I push them out there. Actually, now it's disappeared in favor of Justin.tv,
1340880	1345320	so I'm not sure what's going on right now. But you can check that out always at Orangelaunchradio.com.
1345320	1348720	That is cool that when we are live, the Justin.tv is right there, even though our listeners
1348720	1352360	are telling us it's down right now. So I don't know what's going on with that. We'll see.
1352360	1355520	I don't know, they said Justin.tv was down. I don't know if it came back up. Whatever.
1355520	1361000	But again, remember folks, Justin.tv is priority number two, because we are a radio show.
1361000	1362200	Disconnected again.
1362200	1367040	Weird. We are a radio show, not a TV show, so Justin.tv is not priority number one. So
1367040	1371880	it is going to go down occasionally and that just sucks. So make sure you always tune in
1371880	1378960	to AllGames.com. Anyhow, also our live journal community, all the communities are right there
1378960	1384680	on Orangelaunchradio.com. If you want to find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners, very
1384680	1388920	cool community, just nice people. You know, we don't like jerks in our community. Or if

1404400	1405400	So check that out.
1405400	1406400	Alright.
1406400	1410520	Rob, I have to ask something and I'm going to actually put this up on our gallery. Is
1410520	1412180	that your printer?
1412180	1413180	That one on the floor? Yes.
1413180	1415520	That's my printer. Your printer looks like an ice chest.
1415520	1416520	It does, doesn't it?
1416520	1420940	I'm putting this up. Go to our gallery because we've been putting pictures up on it. I've
1420940	1425320	been taking tons of pictures. So I'm taking a picture of the messy floor.
1425320	1428960	And other people can submit pictures too. But I swear to God, the first time somebody
1428960	1433160	submits a picture that is inappropriate, we're pulling the plug on that thing.
1433160	1436600	No boobs. Okay. Well, no boobs. We should have a special thing.
1436600	1440620	Actually, I'm okay with boobs as long as they're covered boobs. We probably, you know, we do
1440620	1447080	have young kids that look at the website. But like dead or alive boobs are fine. So,
1447080	1453240	alright. Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, shall we, Loki?
1453240	1459040	Yes. So there was, of course, the release this week of Lost in Damned. And with it was
1459040	1464520	a little bit of controversy. Starting off, the bit that I don't really get why it was
1464520	1471880	in there, but it was. Apparently, there was full frontal male nudity in Lost in Damned.
1471880	1478800	Actually, one of the characters that you talked to, Mr. Stubbs, is in a...
1478800	1483760	I'm sorry. That's just funny right there. That the character's name is, you know, Stubby.
1483760	1485240	Mr. Stubbs, yes. He's actually...
1485240	1489120	Is Stubby chubby? I have not seen the scene. Contrary to what you all might think, I have
1489120	1493520	not went and looked at the scene because I think the whole thing is a little silly.
1493520	1501680	It's just whatever, you know. It's full frontal, whatever. So, yeah. So, he's there, you know,
1501680	1507760	completely naked because he's in a bathhouse. And, yeah. He's all hanging out. And everyone's
1507760	1511840	like, oh my god, why'd they do that? And you know what? I have to say, why did they do
1511840	1515960	that? Because here's my thing. If they can put full frontal male nudity in this, why
1515960	1521300	aren't the strippers topless? That's what I want to know. I mean, because that's the
1521300	1526840	lesser of two evils right there. I don't get why that's the case. But, whatever. So, yeah.
1526840	1533400	That's in the game. It's really minor. No big deal. But, just in case. So, there you
1533400	1540440	go. Some other stuff that was interesting. There was some censorship tweaks on the European
1540440	1548440	Australian versions of the game. First off, the European versions. Apparently, their versions
1548440	1554520	of Grand Theft Auto 4 have been censored with the update. This is, of course, by accident.
1554520	1561520	However, you know, Rockstar is working on it right now so that, you know, it will be
1561520	1567560	fixed momentarily, I guess. Maybe within a few days if it hasn't already been fixed.
1567560	1576680	And then, of course, Lost and Damned in Australia has undone the censorship that was actually
1576680	1583760	with it. Basically, the censorship that's going on. There's no blood pools. The camera,
1583760	1590440	when you get, you know, services from a prostitute, you can normally move the camera around to
1590440	1598160	get better angles and stuff. But, in censored versions, it's not. But, apparently, yeah.
1598160	1603640	The Lost and Damned actually reverted the censorship on the Australian version. So,
1603640	1608760	that's kind of interesting. Whatever, it's a cock. Obviously, they're
1608760	1613560	just trying to ruffle some feathers with this and they've succeeded. I mean, whatever. You
1613560	1620900	know, I like, though, that at least it's not, like, sexualized. It's there to accomplish
1620900	1624780	one thing. It's there to get people talking. Well, mission accomplished because here we
1624780	1629780	are in our little crappy podcast talking about your full frontal male nudity in a game that,
1629780	1636140	you know, is completely random. Rob. Rob. Just say it. Cock. Exactly. It's just a cock.
1636140	1640920	It shouldn't be that big of a deal. But, at the same time, I would not suddenly want there
1640920	1646400	to be, like, random cocks in all my games. You know what I mean? Like, you know, suddenly
1646400	1652040	it's, oh my god, a cock monster in Final Fantasy. We need more penis in video games. But, to
1652040	1656720	be fair, if we're going to have more penis, then we need more vag. Right? Just play Second
1656720	1660960	Life. Oh, hi Drew, by the way. We had some guests randomly show up during that comment.
1660960	1665960	Everybody introduce themselves real quick. Who's here and everything? Say hello. Uh oh.
1665960	1672360	Uh oh. Oh, we had a spillage on the laptop in here. Introduce yourselves. I'll run in
1672360	1685360	and get a paper towel for Jimmy. It's Drew, as usual. Uh, hi. We have Danny. Camara. Yeah.
1685360	1692360	Rob has salvaged my laptop because I'm actually trying not to move my laptop, so, um, that
1692360	1702360	was me last week. Did Joe say hi? No, I didn't. Hi. But they know you better as Dark Tetsuya.
1702360	1707360	Alright, awesome. Welcome, Dark Tetsuya, and, uh, friends, everybody's here tonight. If
1707360	1711600	my laptop catches on fire, it's Rob's fault. Okay. Well, it's not my fault. You spilled
1711600	1720280	something on it. You startled me, Rob, with your Rob-ness. It's not my fault if you got
1720280	1724360	excited. Now my laptop smells like Propel. It is not my fault if you got excited at us
1724360	1730760	talking about the story about Cocks and Vag, okay? But we need more games with you. I agree.
1730760	1735040	You know what? If they're gonna have this game with ultra-violence, then why not ultra-nudity,
1735040	1740640	you know? Well, they have paces. I mean, come on. It's just a little bit more flesh. Who
1740640	1745880	cares? I mean, if you're gonna show, you know, cock and balls, I mean, they can seriously
1745880	1751560	just put boobies in there. I mean, I don't get it. I agree. They should be fair and have
1751560	1756800	some boobs in it, too, but, you know, whatever. Whatever. I just don't even care. I don't
1756800	1761120	know why people care so damn much. I mean, I understand it's because we've never really
1761120	1766400	seen this in a game before, OMG. Someone's gotta do it. Whatever. May as well be them.
1766400	1771120	Yeah, may as well. Get it over with. But, you know, who knows? Maybe Cocks the Game
1771120	1778280	coming soon, thanks to all of this. Who knows? Bubble Bath Cocks. I don't know. We'll see.
1778280	1786720	I somehow doubt it. Imagine Cocks, exactly. We'll see. Anyhow, moving on to other stories.
1786720	1789800	Street Fighter IV obviously was a big title this week. We talked a little bit about that
1789800	1795200	during our gaming weeks. And, for those that have played Street Fighter II back in the
1795200	1799440	day, one thing you probably noticed was that some of the characters were missing from Street
1799440	1804560	Fighter II. Namely, DJ and T-Hawk. They were two of the new characters when Super Street
1804560	1808800	Fighter II came out. They were not included in Street Fighter IV, and I kind of say, so
1808800	1813440	what? I mean, these characters weren't exactly popular or good in the first place. Sorry,
1813440	1818740	in my opinion. Bite your tongue. I didn't care for either one of them. I own people
1818740	1824960	with DJ, by the way. DJ was alright, but T-Hawk especially I didn't care for. Although his
1824960	1828520	stage music was awesome. You're such a cheap bitch if you know how to use them. Well, anyway,
1828520	1834400	they weren't there. But see, instead of these two, you got Rose, Sakura, Dan. You know,
1834400	1838320	you got characters from later in the series. In my opinion, it's worth the exchange, but
1838320	1844320	whatevs. Oh, hell yeah. But anyhow, see, Gunstar agrees with me in chat, because DJ and T-Hawk
1844320	1851920	suck. However, all hope may not be lost for DJ and T-Hawk fans. Yoshinori Ono, who is
1851920	1856880	the producer of Street Fighter IV, has kind of teased the idea of these guys appearing
1856880	1861860	later on, and this was in Famitsu magazine. He actually said that some 3D models were
1861860	1866160	created. I'd like to see pictures of that. I bet that would be pretty cool. They actually
1866160	1871400	went so far as to actually plan out the combat style for T-Hawk, but they got cut before
1871400	1876720	the game actually came out. However, Ono did say if the fans want it bad enough, the characters
1876720	1881600	could be added at a later date. How would that happen? Could that be download content?
1881600	1886680	Could that be a re-release of the game? I think that's more likely. I see, I actually
1886680	1891520	see download content, and then a gold edition later, like how they did with Marvel Ultimate
1891520	1895760	Alliance. Right, but here's the thing with download content. If they didn't already plan
1895760	1901520	for these two guys to be download content, what happens if one of my friends downloads
1901520	1907200	it and has T-Hawk and then fights me online? I don't have T-Hawk. What happens? Because,
1907200	1914720	yeah, Drew, you have a thought? Yeah, Push and Update, like they do with, say, the Dawn
1914720	1921200	of War games, the RTS games, where one player doesn't have access to a certain set of races
1921200	1926600	to play as. It's like, okay, you can only play against these players playing these characters.
1926600	1934400	It'd be a little complicated, but it would be a solution. Or have a light pack downloaded
1934400	1941240	where you have the characters there, you just can't select them. You know, kind of like
1941240	1945520	you could get to, what was it they did for Fable 2, where you could, you know, go to
1945520	1951120	that area but you didn't have all the stuff that went with it. Can I say, can I say something
1951120	1955120	a little controversial about Street Fighter 4, and maybe I'm going to get shit for this,
1955120	1959760	I don't know. It's honestly, no no no, it's honestly something I noticed, especially talking
1959760	1966040	about DJ getting cut from the game and all this stuff. Where are the black people in
1966040	1971440	Street Fighter 4? Really? This is an obvious question. There's Balrog. Balrog, that's it.
1971440	1977680	One out of how many? Most everybody in the game is Asian, Rob. But it's like white people
1977680	1981240	beating each other up the game, is what it is. No, it's Asian people beating up the white
1981240	1986540	guys the game. But where's like, you know, well I guess you have one Indian guy too,
1986540	1989720	and you know, I don't know, it just seemed like these guys, you know DJ and T-Hawk, T-Hawk
1989720	1995560	especially was a little more ethnic, like not a type you see in like other games, right?
1995560	2004240	And yeah, he's like, um, I realize it's a little bit, it's a small world-ish, but what?
2004240	2010140	It's a Japanese anime-ish fighting game. Do you really expect that much racial diversity?
2010140	2014640	I'm just saying, there's, listen, there was Def Jam. The game's a little white, that's
2014640	2023560	all I'm saying. No, the game's a lot Asian. Listen, okay, you have 50 Cent, you know,
2023560	2029680	Blood in the Sand coming out this week, it evens itself out, okay? It's AZN for reals,
2029680	2036640	yo. So deal with it. Chat room, am I wrong? Am I, am I a bad person for thinking this?
2036640	2040480	Tell him he's wrong and he's a bad person for thinking it. Biohaze says black people
2040480	2045600	are non-existent in the Street Fighter universe. That's not true, Balrog. Yeah, since the beginning.
2045600	2051080	Gunstar says Sagat is kind of like a brother and he kicks ass. He's Thai. And Game Guru
2051080	2055400	says DJ was created by Capcom USA. That's true, that's something I didn't think of.
2055400	2058720	Remember when they did Super Street Fighter? He was the character of the USA, made good,
2058720	2066240	good observation, Game Guru. Unfolded Raptor wants to point out there are green people.
2066240	2070960	So Biohaze says no more Mexicans. Can we have someone from Central or South America for
2070960	2082880	once? We have Blanca. Yeah, that's kind of a pity. Anyhow, all right. Jimmy! Rolling
2082880	2088560	and rolling. I'm sorry, go look at Dan's ending for Street Fighter 3 and you'll know what
2088560	2091920	I'm talking about. I don't know. And then I could also say, you don't really have a
2091920	2097160	gay fighter either, but then people would say Vega, but Vega's not gay, he's just an
2097160	2104480	asshole. No, I think he's very gay. He's just kind of, here's the thing, he's not gay, he's
2104480	2112120	just queer. There's a difference. I think that Vega, actually I think Vega, well, off
2112120	2120160	camera really is a major, major cross-dresser, a drag queen, seriously. With all that attention
2120160	2128080	to his face, drag queen. Those shoes, look at the heels on those shoes. Drag queen. Act
2128080	2135680	Deaf says he's just metrosexual. Drag queen. All right, please can we change the topic,
2135680	2140200	somebody else. Oh, Dark Soccer, do you have a story for us maybe? I do, speaking of drag
2140200	2146440	queens, I'm kidding. So how many people in here liked American McGee's Alice? We had
2146440	2154040	two hands next to me, shoot up and a ding. Well, there's going to be another one. They're
2154040	2161120	saying that it will not be out for a while, but it's going to be out for PC, PlayStation
2161120	2170440	3, and Xbox 360, and basically saying that EA is behind it along with American McGee
2170440	2176920	and we should be getting it out. So, yay. And they said it's going to be darker. Yeah,
2176920	2183560	the picture that they, more darker. The picture they were teasing it with were like a bunch
2183560	2188400	of snails trying to attack. It's the racing snail. Do you think this could be because,
2188400	2191000	I don't know if you guys know, but there's a new Alice in Wonderland movie coming out
2191000	2195440	next year. It's being done by Tim Burton and like Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter. The guy
2195440	2199480	from Little Britain is Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. You know, they have, they have some pretty
2199480	2204240	interesting casting. The big guy from Little Britain is Tweedle Dee. Oh. Yeah. You know,
2204240	2207640	they have some interesting casting choices. Maybe because they're thinking they're going
2207640	2212440	to kind of catch this Alice craze that might start again next year because of the movie.
2212440	2216240	That seems kind of smart to me. Why not? Because if it's being done by Tim Burton, it's going
2216240	2219240	to be probably a little dark in the first place, so this will kind of fit in nicely.
2219240	2224480	Tim Burton needs to get over himself though, really. What? I love Tim Burton movies. There's
2224480	2227840	very few Tim Burton movies. There's a man though who has gotten too full of himself
2227840	2231680	and too stuck on his style. Well, I don't, ok, I don't listen to him in interviews, granted.
2231680	2236120	I don't know the person, I just know his movies. And you know, I like the movies. At least
2236120	2246160	he's not George Lucas. At least there's always that. Going to chatroom, chat.orangelaungeradio.com,
2246160	2255040	VXJsonXV says, I like how Dark Sakura is personifying a made up character. Hence Vega. DJ Rama S
2255040	2261960	asks, ok Skye, would you date Vega? No, but I have dated guys that were that self-centered.
2261960	2265840	Just so you know. But no, I would not date Vega based on previous experience. So there
2265840	2271800	you go. And the City Vampire simply says Tim Burton needs a haircut. Yeah, that I would
2271800	2277880	agree with. Alright, more gaming news, Loki. Alright, first I have a bit of random stuff
2277880	2281480	while you guys are talking. I was trying to figure out exactly what you have to do in
2281480	2287920	Noby Noby Boy. Which apparently is eat things. But the other thing I found out is that you
2287920	2292960	can eat a human and like an animal or a human and a fruit or something like that. And it
2292960	2300220	will create hybrid creatures when it poops it out. So you want, you can actually create
2300220	2308560	ManBearPig? Yes. In your anus? In your anus. Nice. Alright. Well, something not quite as
2308560	2317000	exciting as anus ManBearPig. EA has announced a port of Dead Space for the Wii. It's actually
2317000	2322200	Dead Space Extraction. It's gonna be an on rail shooter because obviously the Wii can't
2322200	2330680	really hold up, you know, the graphic detail of the 360 and PS3 versions. But it will be
2330680	2337480	kind of, I guess, a little bit like, I guess, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles. But with
2337480	2348720	Dead Space stuff. So new weapons, new enemies, puzzles, co-op multiplayer. Sounds kinda cool.
2348720	2352280	I like light gun shooter games on a, you know I still haven't played the House of the Dead
2352280	2356960	one that just came out. That looked interesting though. That one didn't just come out, did
2356960	2360320	it? It was a little while ago, wasn't it? Well, House of the Dead Overkill, that came
2360320	2363960	out a couple weeks ago. Oh, I didn't realize it was so recent. Was there another, oh no,
2363960	2368760	it was a compilation of prior games, that's right. That was a year ago. Got it a little
2368760	2374880	mixed up. So, alright, well, you're a fan of rail shooters, Dark Soccer, is this something
2374880	2380080	you might get? I don't know. Kind of see a little more. Yeah, no word on when it's gonna
2380080	2385120	be released. I'm sure you'll see a little bit more on it at E3. It's supposed to come
2385120	2391300	out this fall though. November probably. Alrighty. Well hey, moving on to a completely different
2391300	2396400	type of game. Leisure Suit Larry. Remember the old Sierra series, Leisure Suit Larry?
2396400	2399840	You want to talk about the original boobs in video games. You gotta go all the way back
2399840	2403880	to Leisure Suit Larry. And, you know, they tried to bring the series back a couple years
2403880	2408120	ago with a game that was kind of, eh, it was like a lukewarm reception game. And so we
2408120	2412880	kind of thought, eh, this series is probably gone and best remembered in our memory. Well,
2412880	2421040	guess what? Apparently, Leisure Suit Larry Box Office Bust was, it was a game that was
2421040	2425480	kind of cut to the side after Activision and Blizzard merged. You might remember people
2425480	2428520	were talking about Ghostbusters and Brutal Legends and some of these games. Not a lot
2428520	2434040	of people were talking about Leisure Suit Larry. Well, apparently Codemasters has actually
2434040	2439800	jumped in. It's one of their other branches, Funsta, which is a casual game branch of the
2439800	2444840	company. So that's a little interesting in my opinion. But they have picked up the publishing
2444840	2448760	rights to the game. And the game is gonna come out in April. It's gonna be on the PC,
2448760	2455480	Playstation 3, and the 360. And yes, it's been rated mature by the ESRB. No word if
2455480	2461360	there's cocks. Um. There's probably some hits though. This will probably be very similar
2461360	2466040	to the last game that came out. Yeah. Cause that was very casual, it was all minigames.
2466040	2471320	I hope they don't try to charge $60 for it. Are they just, is it just gonna be- No, actually
2471320	2476920	from what I read it's supposed to be $40. Is it just gonna be dirty casual games? It'll
2476920	2481520	probably be- Let me see. The last game that came out, the casual games that they had in
2481520	2488600	there. They had, I don't know if they had streaking in there. I remember there was Quarters.
2488600	2493160	And they had this little, it was fun. It was a little minigame that you had to, you were
2493160	2497840	a little sperm and you had to dodge. That was the minigame I played at E3 a couple years
2497840	2502680	ago. Yeah, you had to dodge something. I don't remember what it was. Stuff. During the conversation,
2502680	2508120	depending on how well you did, your conversation would be smoother or whatever. You'd talk
2508120	2513400	right out of her clothes. But if you hit stuff you'd like fart or like make, you know, stupid
2513400	2518200	comments and stuff like that. So it was pretty funny. I don't know, I kind of liked the last
2518200	2525840	game. But yeah, this one, I don't know. I'll check it out. But who knows. Alright, we'll
2525840	2530160	see. More information I guess on this to come. Probably a little closer to the release date
2530160	2536400	in April. Well, other stuff that's happening near April is a particular game that was very,
2536400	2544040	very popular on Xbox Live Arcade coming to PC on March 31st and that would be Braid.
2544040	2552920	And it's getting a price mark up to 20 bucks. Think it's worth it? Well, it actually, they
2552920	2556600	were going to raise it to 20 bucks, but they ended up bringing it back down to 15. But
2556600	2561240	wasn't it only 10 on Xbox Live? Or was it 15 on Xbox Live? I can't remember. It's been
2561240	2566440	a little while. Yeah. You know, it was one of my favorite games that came out last year.
2566440	2570560	Yeah, yeah, it's worth it. I wouldn't say buy it on both systems. I don't see the point.
2570560	2575840	But if you don't have a 360, yeah, you should buy it. It's a fun game. Well, good for Braid
2575840	2583360	fans. Indeed. You said you hadn't played the game, right? Nope. Do you think you might
2583360	2590320	check it out on PC? Nope. All right. It was worth asking. When do I have time? And the
2590320	2594360	chat room is confirming for me that Braid was 15. You know, it came out a long time
2594360	2601520	ago. I thought it was 10. So sue me. ActDeft begs to differ in our chat room. Chat.honors.radio.com
2601520	2606640	says Braid isn't really worth it. I think it is. I think it's a very different type
2606640	2610600	of puzzle game. It's like Mario is a puzzle game, which is, I don't know. It was very
2610600	2616920	entertaining to me. It was all right. I liked it a lot. And yes, I agree with Acidic Vampire.
2616920	2621320	The soundtrack is beautiful. Sorry, I'll stop interrupting. Speaking of the 360, there
2621320	2631040	is more confirmation of a rumor red Xbox 360 system coming soon. Apparently, the red Xbox
2631040	2638960	360 elite system was mentioned in a Microsoft press release from New Zealand, and it was
2638960	2644280	saying that there was some sort of deal going on where you buy a 360 and get a free copy
2644280	2653840	of Halo Wars, and that the red Xbox 360 elite console, which is exclusive to EB Games. So
2653840	2661380	I guess it's exclusive to EB Games there. Hmm. Maybe there's a red system coming out.
2661380	2667600	Maybe it's going to come out with Resident Evil. Maybe soon. Maybe they're doing red
2667600	2673120	so that you don't notice the rings. That's a joke, I think, that has to be made there.
2673120	2677960	The rings blend in with it. Red seems like a really weird color for a video game system,
2677960	2683720	though. Is it just me? Like, I get black, I get white, I get gray. I even get pink for
2683720	2689120	the DS. I actually understand that. But red? It worked for the Virtual Boy. Oh, sorry.
2689120	2697560	Oh no, it didn't. He saw nothing but red on the Virtual Boy. Yeah. I don't know. I mean,
2697560	2702760	I could see them putting something like this out for a limited time or something. People
2702760	2709600	might buy it. Even the Xbox being green? That made sense, actually. I have the Xbox that
2709600	2714520	was green, the Halo one, not the regular black one. But yeah, I don't know. Red seems like
2714520	2718320	a strange color, though. But okay. I mean, whatever. Maybe I'm just saying that because
2718320	2722120	I know it would totally clash in my house, but why I'm so worried about it, I don't know.
2722120	2729680	I'm sure if this were to actually exist, that they're probably going to be making an announcement
2729680	2733680	very soon on it since Resident Evil comes out in a few weeks. I mean, just assuming
2733680	2736480	that it's actually going to be coming out with Resident Evil. Not that I would know
2736480	2743200	or anything, but I'm just saying. Hypothetically. That something like this would be coming out
2743200	2747800	with Resident Evil, we'd have to know about it very soon since, you know, that's only
2747800	2753440	a few weeks away. Hypothetically speaking. Hypothetically. Well, something you are not
2753440	2758480	allowed to know about, at least until very soon, that would be the evening of February
2758480	2765600	23rd over in Japan, which would be, no, that's going to be late, no, tomorrow morning, right?
2765600	2769960	Well evening in Japan? Yeah, it's evening in Japan. They're on the other side of the
2769960	2774440	date line, so maybe any minute now we're going to hear about this. There's going to be, yeah,
2774440	2777880	no, it's morning over there right now, so probably in the overnight hours for us we'll
2777880	2785320	hear coming out of Japan some new Capcom-based Xbox Live title. Or no, it might be just a
2785320	2789520	360 title that they are announcing through Xbox Live. They're going to be releasing a
2789520	2796360	trailer tomorrow. And here's my thought, wouldn't this just be Dead Rising 2? I mean, because
2796360	2799640	we've kind of had the hype for it the past week and it's been confirmed, like, is it
2799640	2803600	really that big of a secret? Or do we really think something new is going to come out of
2803600	2807560	this? Because when I read this I was like, it's just going to be Dead Rising 2. Or it
2807560	2814200	could be something lame like sheep. Was Capcom making the sheep game? Yeah, they're publishing
2814200	2821300	it. They should do Black Sheep the game. Captain Commando HD Remix. They are 17 hours ahead,
2821300	2825440	so they are about noon. It's about noon in Japan right now, so we'll see more in a little
2825440	2832000	while. I for one support the Captain Commando HD Remix. You think? Dude, I dumped so many
2832000	2839320	quarters in that game, it's not even funny. Maybe Mega Man 10. I somehow doubt it. How
2839320	2846040	about Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Area 50, or no, no, what was that game? Oh, no, no, I'm sorry,
2846040	2854800	take that back. UN Squadron on Xbox Live. That would be awesome. UN Squadron. Act F
2854800	2861080	says Dark Stalkers for the love of God. Lioshin says Power Stone 3. I have to interject. I've
2861080	2866280	gotten the best reaction out of Drew ever. What? I've shown him a copy of the Amazon
2866280	2870920	page for the book I'm going to be ordering. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the classic
2870920	2876040	Regency romance now with ultra-violent zombie mayhem. That would kind of tie into the whole
2876040	2880560	Dead Rising thing. Yes. DJ Rama S in chat suggests Rival Schools 3 could be the mystery
2880560	2888920	game. Yes, I know, I wish. Damn you, Capcom. Dream on, I hate to say it. We'll see. Alright,
2888920	2891680	let's travel the world and look at some release dates that we actually know about. Or another
2891680	2896320	Monster Hunter game, because they like making Monster Hunter. That would make sense for
2896320	2903160	Japan too. They didn't advertise that the trailer was going to be here, right? I don't
2903160	2905800	know, we'll see. Alright, let's travel the world and look at some of the release dates
2905800	2911020	that we know about. We'll start off in Europe, Dark Sakura. Well, coming out for the gaming
2911020	2917280	systems and PCs and stuff in Europe, on the 27th, we have Castlevania Judgment on Wii,
2917280	2924080	Cryostasis for PC, Dead Rising and Chop Till You Drop on Wii, Family Ski and Snowboard
2924080	2931440	on Wii, Halo Wars for Xbox 360, Killzone 2 for Playstation 3, Men of War on PC, Necro
2931440	2940720	Vision on PC, Onechambara, Bikini Samurai Squad, and Bikini Zombie Slayers, First for
2940720	2948240	the 360, Second for Wii, Silent Hill Homecoming on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC, and Ultimate
2948240	2956560	Band on DS and Wii. The end. You know, it's funny that you mention, that I was talking,
2956560	2961340	we were talking about Capcom in an announcement and stuff like that, because on Kotaku here,
2961340	2968360	they have listed Flock as coming out next week on Xbox Live Arcade. Remember Flock was
2968360	2974960	the sheep one by Capcom. Boring! I don't think that's that, but you never know. Anyways,
2974960	2978320	next week's actually pretty exciting for game releases. There's some pretty good stuff coming
2978320	2984080	out, including Star Ocean Last Hope on Xbox 360, which should be pretty epic. Pretty good
2984080	2992200	reviews so far. 50 Cent, Blood on the Sand on PS3 and Xbox 360. Hell yes! Shell Shock
2992200	3003240	2, Blood Trails on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC. Legacy of Ys, Book 1 and 2 on DS. Yay! Nice! Puzzle
3003240	3013200	Quest Galactrix on DS. Cool. Dead Rising Chop Till You Drop on the Wii. Stoked on Xbox 360,
3013200	3021200	it's a pretty fun snowboarding game. Imagine Ice Champions on DS. Supposedly, Eat Lead
3021200	3025440	the Return of Matt Hazard. I hope that comes out that week, because I thought it was the
3025440	3040160	week after, but you never know. Let's see, Killzone 2 on PS3. Pagle on DS. My Personal
3040160	3049440	Diary on DS. And Puzzle Challenges and More on Wii. Unfolded Raptor in chat says, Blood
3049440	3053800	on the Sand is going to be game of the year, just watch. Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com, live
3053800	3058960	on Sunday nights. I'm tempted to buy it, just to see. There's a part of me that wants to
3058960	3062800	buy it, but it's probably going to be 60 bucks, right? There's going to be 60 bucks, don't
3062800	3066840	buy it. I'll wait for it to hit the bargain bin. Dude, do you know what I saw at Best
3066840	3072880	Buy the other day? A Rock Revolution bundle for 30 bucks. That's drums and game. Yeah,
3072880	3078800	I think that's just slightly under what they normally cost now. I mean, it's that bad.
3078800	3082120	I thought about it, because you can use the drums with other games, right? Yeah, but they
3082120	3088480	suck that bad. But I mean, hey, if you want, get the game for the download content, because
3088480	3093880	they have some of the guitar freak stuff in there. Ah, that's a good reason. Think about
3093880	3101360	it. Yeah, I don't know. So that, I think that's pretty much it for this week. Alright, let's
3101360	3105320	look at the Japanese release dates then. Also, a pretty big week in Japan. They've got some
3105320	3110100	busy, busy stuff going on over in Japan. On the 26th of February, you have Battlefield
3110100	3115200	Bad Company getting a price reduction. Chaos Head Noah is a new game coming out over in
3115200	3119600	Japan. Halo 3 also gets a price reduction. That's because Halo Wars is slated to come
3119600	3126040	out on February 26th over there in Japan. Busy, busy week. Samurai Doh 3 comes out as
3126040	3130200	well, and Rainbow Six Vegas 2 also gets a price reduction, so it's a good week for some
3130200	3135880	sales over there in Japan. Moving on to the Playstation 3, NBA Live gets a price reduction.
3135880	3142960	Otherwise, as far as a new game goes, Ryu Ga Gotoku comes out, number 3 in the series.
3142960	3151600	I'm not sure what this is. It's the Yakuza 3. It's just Yakuza 3? Yeah. Oh, okay. Looks
3151600	3158720	like you can get some romance on in this one. Yes, they have chicks you can pick up. Nice.
3158720	3163920	Tom Clancy's End War also coming out on Playstation 3. Again, these are Japanese release dates.
3163920	3167480	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, it's actually kind of a slow week for once in Japan on the
3167480	3172920	Wii. High School Musical 3, senior year. Medal of Honor Heroes 2 gets a price reduction.
3172920	3180920	As far as the new game goes, One Piece Unlimited Cruise, Episode 2, Mesamiro Yuusha comes out.
3180920	3184800	Let's see, apparently there was already an Episode 1 that came out, and you can actually
3184800	3190320	use your save file from Episode 1 to continue on with your quest in this game. So it's an
3190320	3195520	action game that's kind of comical. Based off the One Piece anime series with stretchy
3195520	3204600	pirates. Really? Nice. Playstation 2, you have the King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match
3204600	3211000	coming out in Japan. I know there's some King of Fighter fans in the house. And on the Nintendo
3211000	3219480	DS, kind of a range of games. Dragon Dance, Game Center CX, Arena no Chosenju comes out
3219480	3229040	as well. A Voice Chat DS application comes out as well. As Kameko Deluxe DS Yomei Tomika
3229040	3237120	To Otoko Tohona comes out. And that is, looks like a little girly adventure game, but there's
3237120	3242080	bowling in it. I don't know if it's like a minigame collection or what, but there's like
3242080	3246520	a little bowling minigame in that. Probably not something we're going to get over here.
3246520	3251320	And lastly, on the PSP, again in Japan, because sometimes they get stuff before we do, you
3251320	3259860	get a port of Dragon Dance, and Kamen no Maid Guy Boyouyan Battle Royale comes out. It's
3259860	3263880	an adventure game, not to be confused with the Battle Royale movie that we all know and
3263880	3268160	love. But it does have girls in school girl outfits, and it looks like they're fighting
3268160	3274600	each other. Based off the manga series. Is it? And they attack each other with brooms.
3274600	3277800	Is this like maids fighting each other? That's what it looks like. I don't know what it is.
3277800	3284880	Yeah, it's in the title. Kamen no Maid. Maid games are like, anything maids are like, major
3284880	3291640	major big fetish deals. Well, there you have it. So you fetish fans, get that on PSP. Also,
3291640	3298600	your memories off, girls style. At least I wasn't called your panties off. Wow, that's
3298600	3302560	an adventure game. Because if it was, that would be an instant purchase. You might want
3302560	3308360	to go women's style, not girls style for that. And then lastly, Shin Sangoku Musou Multi-Raid
3308360	3317520	comes out on the PSP. That's an action game that looks like, looks a little Final Fantasy-ish,
3317520	3321720	but with some live action elements in it, it looks like. So check that out on PSP. If
3321720	3325440	you're in Japan. There you have it. That does it for your PSP. Or if you want to get it
3325440	3331400	for your friends in America, who do a show for you every Sunday. And DJ Rama S in chat
3331400	3339160	room says, yes, maid games do sell. I know I sell a lot of hentai maid games. Congratulations.
3339160	3346040	Well how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with maids? Yes, please. Bobsleds!
3346040	3352760	Have a maid in a bobsled. You know there is someone out there who has a fetish for maids
3352760	3359840	on bobsleds. But no. If so, this show's for you. This is high speed bobsled racing from
3359840	3367140	Sega. God, Sega, why do you do this to me? It's called Storm G and it's a deluxe cabinet
3367140	3374840	set where they've got them all lined up. And it's supposed to have you bobsledding and
3374840	3386120	rocket powered blobs- blobs- bobsleds. Boobsledding? Okay. Each sled though- That would be cold!
3386120	3394060	Too cold! Each sled though accommodates two people and it has twin joysticks and each
3394060	3400800	person controls different aspects of- Boobs and twin joysticks. Bob! Each joystick controls
3400800	3408760	different aspects of it to do 360 degree rotation and increase your speed. I think the maid
3408760	3414680	fans would like this game. It sounds pretty hot. At any rate, it's like a 10 minute game
3414680	3424080	and you pay about 650 to play at 600 yen. And it's already at the Joyopolis in March.
3424080	3429160	For any of our Japanese listeners, go there and take pictures of it and get signs of it
3429160	3434040	in play. Really, really want to see what it's like. Have fun bobsledding with your twin
3434040	3444120	joysticks at Joyopolis. Don't forget to send us your postcards. Well, if rocket bobsledding
3444120	3451080	isn't for you, there are some other games coming out as well that are equally epic,
3451080	3458840	including the brand new game running on Sega's new hardware, Ring Edge, and the game's called
3458840	3464640	Border Break. You may remember it as, well it's sort of like Virtual On actually, but
3464640	3470980	played a little bit more linear, kind of like Armored Core. So it's a mech action fighting
3470980	3478080	game, which looks pretty awesome. And unfortunately it probably won't be coming to the US, but
3478080	3483240	it will be in Japanese arcades beginning February 23rd. In other words, next week. So, looks
3483240	3488040	pretty awesome. You know, I'm looking at this next story and I'm thinking, you know what?
3488040	3491640	I think this will be great for Jamie's birthday. Jamie, what do you say? How about for your
3491640	3497960	birthday, I buy you four Sega arcade cabinets for your house. I'm going to buy you Outrun,
3497960	3503360	Hang On, Space Harrier, and Thunder Blade. Don't you want that in your house? Got two
3503360	3510400	out of four, right? Well, there is a little twist to this because I don't actually, I'm
3510400	3517760	not pooping money. I actually would be buying these new toys that are coming out. It's coming
3517760	3523880	out from, I'm not, Organic is the name of the toy maker. They are taking classic Sega
3523880	3530560	arcade cabinets and shrinking them down to like four inches in length. And those are
3530560	3534000	the four cabinets they're going to be releasing as these little figurine toys. These are like
3534000	3541200	little gachapon, basically. Yeah. But the capsule game stuff. Well, no, they're actual,
3541200	3545000	the actual arcade cabinet. Like they're toys that look like the little cabinets, but I
3545000	3550400	was saying they're little capsule toys. You buy the box and you get a random one out of
3550400	3555440	each box. Probably. It doesn't say if they're actual capsule toys or what the thing is going
3555440	3561480	on, but I don't think they're playable. That's for sure. But this little thing, those are
3561480	3568160	very, very, very popular. I mean, getting all the various character and goods that come
3568160	3573800	up. Capcom's actually got a series of little figures for some of the female characters.
3573800	3578120	By the way, there is a fifth cabinet. That's a secret. According to the website, secret
3578120	3586560	my ass. You know what that is? I think is, um, a, uh, well, no, it can't be a, it can't
3586560	3590800	be an afterburner because afterburner is a closed machine. Oh yeah. Cause it went a little
3590800	3595640	high. Oh, well actually no, I think, I think it might be an afterburner if they had like
3595640	3600620	the cover off of it. Maybe it's a houses of the dead. No, no, no. I don't think you sat
3600620	3605480	down with that one. Well, these are all classic cabinets. So it can't be, it can't be the
3605480	3610400	very much space area. Well, no, you know what, honestly, I think it, I think it is an afterburner
3610400	3616640	because, um, space Harrier, if I'm right, um, had the closed top too. And this figure
3616640	3621080	doesn't, yeah, it just kind of makes sense to with the other games it would fit in. Yeah,
3621080	3626520	we'll see. We'll probably see when these things come out. It's one of the Sega 360 machines.
3626520	3631040	Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't know about some of these, uh, acidic vampire says WTF. I can't
3631040	3637560	play it. If it's four inches, a game guru says next up a miniature mega drive. Who knows?
3637560	3642000	I think they have those. It's possible. They do it like, especially another, I hear like
3642000	3647720	in some other countries like in South American stuff, those, um, uh, little Genesis collections
3647720	3652840	that are in the controllers and stuff are very popular. So, of course I could be full
3652840	3657280	of crap too. It wouldn't be the first time. We'll see. But let's do some, those are just
3657280	3663480	a little gotcha poem. Other news. Well, in other news, we have some news about the Metal
3663480	3670600	Gear movie and you know how pissed off I was. They were taking my man off of it. Well, guess
3670600	3676000	what? And your man is? David Hader. He's back on. Well, he didn't come right out and say
3676000	3683200	it, but he danced around saying everything, but yes, I'm back. So, um, at an interview
3683200	3687520	and actually, um, there, I'm going to go ahead and actually post a link up to the article,
3687520	3693880	um, because there's a copy of the interview, um, on there. Um, it's on Kotaku, but, um,
3693880	3698480	in an interview, he was basically saying that there's a possibility of involvement in being
3698480	3702560	back on it instead of just saying no. So I'll be posting that in the chat room so everyone
3702560	3708000	can watch the interview. It's cool. It makes me happy. Very cool. I know you love David
3708000	3712880	Hader. Oh, hell yeah. I mean, he gave us the first X-Men movie and he's the voice of Solid
3712880	3720080	Snake, so it makes sense. He should just play Snake. Well, another movie that may have been
3720080	3726360	at one time, but I don't think it's coming out anytime soon, if at all. Um, Mega Man,
3726360	3733000	the movie, apparently Warner Brothers at one time, um, was trying to acquire the rights
3733000	3737840	for the Mega Man series to, um, turn it into a feature film. God, no, please don't. You
3737840	3741720	know this would be terrible. It would be, it would be absolute shit if they were to
3741720	3747000	do this as a movie. Unless it was, like, animated. You could not do a live-action Mega Man movie.
3747000	3752320	I'm sorry. Uh, yeah. Capcom, the creators, are, um, wary, letting anyone touch the project
3752320	3758040	after a few disastrous licensing moves with the property, as well as the recent so-so
3758040	3765640	reaction to other movie adaptions. The most recent movie made that the suits, um, asked
3765640	3771160	Capcom for, or, the most recent move made was that the suits asked Capcom for a wishlist
3771160	3777400	of directors, and Shyamalan, that's right, as in M. Night Shyamalan, was one of the names
3777400	3784200	they came back with. You know, here's the thing. M. Night Shyamalan movies have gotten
3784200	3787560	progressively worse, too. Yeah, but here's the thing, though. He's trying to break out
3787560	3792280	from doing- I did like the village. Well, okay, okay, enough of the actual M. Night
3792280	3796480	Shyamalan movies that he writes and stuff like that. He's actually trying to break out
3796480	3801280	from doing those types of movies, and that's why he's doing the live-action Avatar movie,
3801280	3806760	which is, you know, based off the Nickelodeon animated series. So, if that turns out okay,
3806760	3813480	then maybe he can direct other things that don't have twists in them, you know? So, I
3813480	3819560	don't know. It's- they shouldn't touch it. But, you know what, though, nowadays with
3819560	3823680	technology becoming better and better, I mean, they could do something pretty cool with it,
3823680	3830760	but it's just- it's so hard to do something like that. Gameguru in chat says, Avatar the
3830760	3834720	movie will flop. Well, we'll see. You don't know. There might be a lot of kids that wanna
3834720	3839360	go see that. I don't know. Well, we have one more story before we get to the classic game
3839360	3843080	of the week and start to close out part A here tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, and that
3843080	3847880	is about a very interesting ROM hack. I mean, some people have got a lot of frickin' time
3847880	3854220	on their hands. Some Japanese ROM hack folks have taken a Final Fantasy II ROM and basically
3854220	3859560	converted it to Final Fantasy X. Now, granted, a lot of it is still, like, you know, just
3859560	3864920	basically palette-swapping, but they've actually been able to insert some cutscenes into it
3864920	3870600	that fit with the Final Fantasy X story. The water scene between Tidus and Yuna is in there,
3870600	3873560	which is kind of interesting. And look at that title screen just alone. It's like, oh
3873560	3879240	my gosh, I can't believe they actually worked that into an 8-bit cartridge. So, yeah, some
3879240	3884320	folks- That's very impressive. Yeah, but seriously, you got a lot of time on your hands if you're
3884320	3890000	doing that kind of detail. Well, seriously, I'm actually gonna play through this. Totally.
3890000	3893560	Looks better than that Chinese Final Fantasy VII that was out a little while ago. Yeah,
3893560	3897080	it does look a lot better than the Final Fantasy VII, I'll give you that. Looks a lot better
3897080	3900960	than that. Yeah, and GameGuru says, wasn't there a Final Fantasy VII NES ROM hack? Yes,
3900960	3908960	there was. So, there you go. Alright, so let's move into the classic video game of the week.
3908960	3913480	You know, every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, we tell you guys, go into your classic
3913480	3918840	archives, and find an old game to pay some respect to. And Dark Sakura digs through her
3918840	3925640	own huge archive of games. You told me how many systems, you and Dan counted, right?
3925640	3931160	I think we came up to 30 to 32, something like that. Systems? Yeah. That's crazy. So,
3931160	3938280	you've dug through all those archives- That's non-import, non-duplicate systems. Wow. That's
3938280	3943120	crazy. With the imports, we get up to 40. 40-ish. Oh my gosh. But you still don't have
3943120	3948560	a Pippin. What's up with that? Just kidding. Anyhow, let's go ahead and look at the classic
3948560	3952880	video game of the week, which if I'm not mistaken, is pretty topical this week. Right, Dark Sakura?
3952880	3957680	But before we say your name, you've got to play the music, because I know people are
3957680	3962360	going to get it right away. Okay, then let me fire up the music here. Here's a return
3962360	3974200	of video game music video. Okay, now we all get it, don't we? Oh, it's the Puzzle Fighter
3974200	3982280	theme. Bite my butt. The game is Street Fighter Alpha 2 or Street Fighter Zero 2, and I don't
3982280	3986840	mention the first one, because as awesome as the first one was, the second one was the
3986840	3998040	best. Oh, what? The first game is no longer canon. The second game replaced the first
3998040	4006520	game's storyline. Yeah, what he said. So, Street Fighter Alpha 2 basically was the game
4006520	4012400	that gave us the annoying things called alpha counters, which I actually kind of like, but
4012400	4018920	I hate doing them by accident. We have the three level super combo gauge, air blocking
4018920	4025880	and ball breaking, and thank god we didn't get parrying in that one like in Street Fighter
4025880	4033920	3, because parrying while cool was a pain in the ass. So basically it's, and I honestly
4033920	4037920	think this was pretty much the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series, because Alpha 3
4037920	4043360	was kind of ass, except for some of the characters in it, and I hated the A-ism, B-ism, I hated
4043360	4051800	picking all that shit. So, anyway, this also had Akuma as a regular character, or as he
4051800	4055680	was in the Japanese version, Goki, which I think is a better name, especially if you
4055680	4061760	consider the current storyline that it was Goki versus Goken. So anyway, so you actually
4061760	4067880	got Shin Akuma as your secret opponent. Everyone brought in the rival thing, which I was going
4067880	4072480	to say, I was really glad they put that in Street Fighter 4, the whole rival, where you
4072480	4080480	have like your special opponent, who's your main nemesis or whatever. And then you also
4080480	4089560	have Instantly Selectable, you have Bison, who was Vega in the Japanese version, Akuma
4089560	4098680	and Dan. You also got three characters who were returning from other games. You got Zangief
4098680	4103440	and Zalcine, and then you got Gen, who was from the first Street Fighter game. You also
4103440	4109520	got Rolento from Final Fight, and Sakura, who was the first original new character for
4109520	4113680	that series, and I thought it was really cool. Well, even for the second one that came out,
4113680	4120200	for Alpha, too. Anyway, I was very happy, though, when they shared bringing in the Final
4120200	4123800	Fight characters, because I freaking loved Final Fight. I've been collecting everywhere
4123800	4131560	for Final Fight, except for the American-made crap versions. Didn't Dan count as an original
4131560	4138600	character as well? He was in the first game! Yep. On top of that, for anyone who doesn't
4138600	4146760	know, he's totally a parody of Art of Fighting, because Ryo and Robert Garcia were combined
4146760	4152920	to make Dan who was a big joke. However, if you can beat the game with him, mad props
4152920	4160320	to you. You can beat Puzzle Fighter with him, mad props to you. So... Juice has real men
4160320	4169000	played Dan. Anyway, so you've got all your characters, you have, you know, basically
4169000	4174400	different versions of them. You've got arcade versions on the consoles. Now, this is going
4174400	4185400	to be me bitching for just a moment. The Super NES... We did not play 2s. Well, the other
4185400	4196160	two ran out. I like Chun-Li. This is a game where I decided that Chun-Li is a bitch. Anyway,
4196160	4205040	there was a Super Nintendo version of this released in 96. I had this for a while before
4205040	4212640	it was removed from my possession without me knowing. Rawr. Die. It was the version
4212640	4219800	that made use of the SDD1 chip for graphic decompression. So guess what it put into a
4219800	4229600	cartridge game? Load time. It had, now loading, in a freaking SNES cartridge. It had to decompress
4229600	4239240	and load. And I'm like, damn. This is slow. There was also a PC version that was based
4239240	4247560	off the Playstation version. It was okay. I actually have that somewhere in my house.
4247560	4252280	There was the home version that came out of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, which in Japan
4252280	4258860	came out of Street Fighter Zero 2 Dash. And it was also part of the Street Fighter collection
4258860	4268720	that was a big compilation. And then there was the, in the gold version it had Kami based
4268720	4275920	on her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance. And it was, she was actually a hidden character
4275920	4284440	that was selectable in the versus and training modes. So that was pretty cool. Also, on Playstation
4284440	4292160	2 we got Street Fighter Alpha Anthology, which is more like the arcade version of the game.
4292160	4297760	It was pretty cool. There, I actually got both the Saturn and the Playstation versions.
4297760	4304800	And the Saturn version, way better. Way better. It's far better than the Playstation version
4304800	4310040	was. Actually, anything 2D, practically, the Saturn version is going to be better. Better
4310040	4315800	colors, better, it can handle 2D graphics and sound so much better than the Playstation
4315800	4328280	version. At any rate, they actually, in 1996, Dan won number one video game character and
4328280	4333920	Sakura won number three video game character, which I thought was funny, that was actually
4333920	4340920	in Gamest Magazine, which is a Japanese magazine. Got best fighting game, number nine best in
4340920	4347200	graphics, number six best direction, number four best video game music. So that's pretty
4347200	4354040	cool. And it seriously, oh, we got Rose's music. Rose is in Street Fighter IV, I thought
4354040	4360080	it was cool. But it's just a really, to me it is the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series.
4360080	4364840	I mean, I love Street Fighter IV, and actually I like Street Fighter III for just playing
4364840	4371880	as Ibuki. But other than that, I mean, Street Fighter II is like the top-under for me. It
4371880	4373520	does not get better than that.
4373520	4378400	Alright, well there you have it. Your classic video game of the week, Street Fighter Alpha
4378400	4383200	2. A very good topical pick, considering the game that's on everybody's mind this week.
4383200	4388060	We have to take a minute to respect the classics that help inspire some of the appearances
4388060	4393080	you see in Street Fighter IV, such as Rose and Sakura and Dan and so on. So, that's going
4393080	4396520	to do it for part A of our show, but don't go anywhere. Darn it, we got plenty more of
4396520	4402660	our show to come up. Part B, since Drew and Joe and everybody joined us late, I'll ask
4402660	4406360	them about their gaming weeks at the start of part B. And then we have some stuff to
4406360	4409920	get into as well. We're going to talk about the DSi, finally got a release date in North
4409920	4414280	America, confirming some earlier rumors that were floating around out there.
4414280	4415280	That's so weird.
4415280	4418200	That's so weird how that happens. We're going to talk about some video game law here in
4418200	4423700	California and some other Wii rumors. So, don't go anywhere. We'll be right back with
4423700	4432080	more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4432080	4436880	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Here on this lovely Sunday evening, February
4436880	4442040	the 22nd of 2009, and we're watching Loki playing Noby Noby Boy on Justin TV and just
4442040	4444240	giggling at the little farting noises it's making.
4444240	4450080	The secret word, Rob, is parakeet.
4450080	4453520	There's definitely a little parakeet sitting there in the bottom corner or what have you.
4453520	4457560	So, alright, Loki's going to switch it off and get it switched back over to our camera
4457560	4461680	feed in studio. And we're going to get back into some gaming news.
4461680	4464680	Space squirrel in the corner.
4464680	4468360	Alright, we're going to get back into some gaming news in just a minute, but first I
4468360	4472480	thought we would start since Loki needs a minute to get things switched back anyway.
4472480	4476000	Talk about our gaming weeks a little bit. Drew, since you guys came a little late, how
4476000	4478460	was your gaming week? What kind of games have you been playing lately?
4478460	4484680	Pretty good. Kim came to visit, so brought over the PS2, played some Karaoke Revolution,
4484680	4493240	some Guitar Hero, King of Fighters 06, and surprisingly a little bit of the original
4493240	4498520	Naruto Ultimate Ninja. I don't know why we were playing it, but we were playing it.
4498520	4503800	I wanted to because I was bored. You asked for it. You're the one who suggested
4503800	4508080	it, not me. I just so happened to bring it with me.
4508080	4513080	I've been too tired to remember what I've been playing.
4513080	4515960	Alright, that's alright, that's alright. Kim doesn't want to go. You sound kind of
4515960	4519600	sick, are you alright? Um, yeah, it's just a cold, I think, in the
4519600	4523120	back. Yeah, I had that a week ago, it sucks.
4523120	4528400	Alright, uh, Joe is behind you. What have you been playing lately, Joe?
4528400	4533480	Also known as Dark Tetsuya from our website. I actually picked up Need for Speed Underground.
4533480	4536480	Oh, how's that? It's kind of cool. I want to get the second
4536480	4538680	one. How is it different from other Need for Speed
4538680	4541640	games? I don't know, there's a lot of emphasis on
4541640	4546520	tuning your car. Making it look cool. So it's like Pimp My Ride?
4546520	4553160	Pretty much. Only more fun. Alright, we gotcha. Alright, cool, cool.
4553160	4557520	Well, um, it looks like Loki's got everything switched back on Justin.TV from our, uh, from
4557520	4561680	our bra- uh oh, what happened? Did we not get any audio over there?
4561680	4568560	Uh oh. We'll see what happens. There might be some feedback. Live radio, of course we
4568560	4577060	do tape live on Sunday nights at AllGames.com. They don't see video, just audio for some
4577060	4580760	reason on Justin.TV, but again, Justin.TV is not the top priority. We are trying to
4580760	4584560	do a radio show, so we'll figure it out one way or another, I guess.
4584560	4591120	Uh, anyhow, um, I want to get back into gaming news, but we need Loki to start us off. That's
4591120	4594560	alright, just don't worry about it for a minute. Just let it- they can deal.
4594560	4597440	Chatham always goes up in arms when Justin.TV goes down. I'm like, it's a radio show!
4597440	4599440	It's working! You don't need Justin.TV. Alright.
4599440	4601440	It's working now, it wasn't plugged in all the way or something.
4601440	4607760	Alright, fair enough. Alright. Anyways, so, um, the Nintendo DSI was announced this week
4607760	4614440	that it would be coming out in the US, um, in the rest of North America on April 5th,
4614440	4619960	which is pretty close to estimates made by certain media outlets, but, um, it will be
4619960	4626720	coming out in the, um, North American region in two different colors, both black and kind
4626720	4638720	of a light blue, and will be retailing for $169.99. Neat, I guess. Um, yeah, I don't
4638720	4645120	know. Um, I'm not probably gonna pick one up myself, but, um, I don't know, they're
4645120	4649840	kinda cool, I guess. What's also neat, though, um, they're gonna be still supporting the
4649840	4654540	regular DS, of course, with the four colors that they have available, and, uh, no word
4654540	4661680	on when there's actually gonna be some DSI exclusive, um, cartridges, because right now
4661680	4667640	the only kind of exclusive stuff for the DSI is the stuff in the DSIware store, so.
4667640	4670840	You know, I was reading some interesting stories on the internet this week about prototypes
4670840	4675160	for the DSI and how at one point they wanted it to have, like, two DS card slots, but I
4675160	4680560	don't, I never really understood why. I don't get that either. By the way, that blue DS
4680560	4685480	is butt ugly. Well, maybe, maybe they were thinking that they could do, like, say, for
4685480	4690160	example, multi-cart games or something like that, because the storage on the DS cartridges
4690160	4694480	is pretty small, maybe have, like, half a game on one cartridge, half on another cartridge,
4694480	4701440	and you plug them both in, and then you don't have to, you know, swap cartridges, I guess.
4701440	4704640	The problem with the blue DSI for me, and we have actdeft in chat, says, I like the
4704640	4708120	blue DSI. The problem with the blue DSI for me, it's one of my high school's colors. My
4708120	4712280	old high school, that was actually one of their colors, that gross light blue type color.
4712280	4717760	Black. Not my favorite. Alright, well, also coming out on April 5th, a game that I'm sure
4717760	4722200	a lot of our long-time listeners who are into music games, since that's what we started
4722200	4728600	on, would be interested in. Rhythm Heaven, also known as, of course, Rhythm Tengoku overseas.
4728600	4733480	Rhythm Heaven is going to be coming out on April 5th, as well as the DSI systems. Just
4733480	4737320	so you know, this game was made by the same people that made WarioWare, and it's kind
4737320	4741680	of like, it's something like that, but it's more with music. It's really hard to explain
4741680	4746920	this game. I played it at PAX, so this game has kind of been ready a little while, but
4746920	4751920	it's kind of some cool little musical mini-games. So, I think there'll be a lot of folks that
4751920	4756880	enjoy that, and I love this little alien character in the game, too, and I've seen that on people's
4756880	4762400	live journal icons and stuff, so there you go. So that is coming out as well on April
4762400	4768720	5th, and I'm sure there'll be plenty of folks getting copies of that. Well, there's actually
4768720	4775120	supposed to be more games coming out there saying that they're working on an adaptation
4775120	4784400	of Katamari Damacy and Mr. Driller for the DSiWare, according to Famitsu, anyway. There's
4784400	4791480	also going to be a Wii game of Mr. Driller, Mr. Driller World, that has a DS version that's
4791480	4798320	supposed to be called- oh my god, how am I going to pronounce this? Okay, I'm gonna try.
4798320	4805320	I butcher names all the time in the Japanese release dates. This is long. Alright. Sekuto
4805320	4813180	Hamureru Hori Hori Action, which will have 17 levels, to be out in Japan next week. Alpha
4813180	4821320	Kananagram in chat says, that Katamari game is just a re-skinned pack attack. Cheap. Cheap.
4821320	4825680	Not surprising. You know, they better make these releases good, or people are gonna say
4825680	4830800	all these DSi things are cheap. I don't know. Well, I can imagine that most of them will
4830800	4838580	be cheap. But, oh well. Now, if you happen to be living in Europe, you're in luck. You
4838580	4844960	get the DSi a couple days early. It will be releasing there on April 3rd. However, no
4844960	4850720	price has been announced yet. In Europe, luckily, will not be getting Ugly Blue, but they will
4850720	4859000	be getting White and Black. So, I don't know why, for whatever reason, I guess us Americans
4859000	4868920	can't handle White. It's gotta be Blue. Interesting. Interesting as well that Europe usually gets
4868920	4876240	screwed by Nintendo on release dates, but now it's actually gonna beat the US by a couple
4876240	4881360	days. Just a couple days. They'll probably get screwed on price still, but a couple days.
4881360	4887840	So I guess only a couple reasons to bitch, I don't know. Anyhow, some big news coming
4887840	4891800	out of California this week. We live in a very interesting state, obviously. We broadcast
4891800	4894800	out of California and all of the people you see on the show are California residents.
4894800	4898860	We've had this whole budget crisis going on where none of us have been getting state tax
4898860	4903240	returns because they don't have the money, basically. They finally signed a budget middle
4903240	4908780	last week after, what, like 106, 109 days? Something crazy. Well, maybe they didn't pass
4908780	4913960	the budget on time because they were too busy dealing with video game laws. And guess what?
4913960	4918560	The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals came down this week and said that the California game
4918560	4926280	law has been stricken. Basically, they came out and placed a permanent injunction on it
4926280	4933880	and it's no longer there. The ESA president, Michael Gallagher, says this is a win, saying
4933880	4939400	it sends a clear signal at these types of reckless legislations. It's wasting taxpayers'
4939400	4944380	money, government time, and state resources. Of course, Leland Yee, who has been heavily
4944380	4950320	involved in this bill and everything, is pushing for California to appeal the ruling to the
4950320	4955960	Supreme Court. By the way, I believe as a part of this, we will have to pay the ESA
4955960	4959720	fees for this, just like another state had to do not that long ago. I remember we covered
4959720	4967280	on the show. What a great thing for a broke state to be doing. Maybe you guys should just
4967280	4971000	give up on that whole thing. So whenever we talk about these video game laws and them
4971000	4975840	trying to censor video games and all this stuff, we get angsty. And when we get angsty,
4975840	4999120	FUs of the week happen. Believe it or not, I don't have any FUs. No, I take that back
4999120	5004800	all day. FUs are people who don't know how to grow the fuck up. And before anyone says
5004800	5010600	anything, it's not who people may think I'm talking about. I knew you were talking about
5010600	5015640	me. I knew it. Bitch. Well, you know what? I'm going to cut you. No, shoot. Okay, I'm
5015640	5019220	not going to go into detail, but I have... Okay, I'll go into a little detail. I have
5019220	5029080	a friend who, as long as I have known this person, basically gives off the impression
5029080	5035200	of being very generous and very open to people, but really it's all very self-serving. You
5035200	5040800	know what I mean? It's like, for anyone who is a philosophy nut like me, it's pretty much
5040800	5045600	like how Hobbes said people were, that you only do good deeds because it makes you feel
5045600	5051760	good. This is what I've come to realize about this particular person, so FU to that. Grow
5051760	5057520	the fuck up. I'm not going to deal with it anymore. Alrighty, Loki. FU for the second
5057520	5062840	week in a row to the weather for ruining yet another airsoft outing. I was supposed to
5062840	5068400	be going on Sunday today, this morning, however it is raining and will continue the rain until
5068400	5075880	next Sunday. It's so retarded. It was clear all week long and then fucking rained on Sunday,
5075880	5083480	the day that I'm going. So fuck you mother nature, fuck you right up your ass. Is it
5083480	5088440	possible to fuck mother nature in her ass? I don't know about that. I'm going to say
5088440	5094800	an FU to the fact that I'm kind of hungry and so I'm going to eat something soon. FU
5094800	5107360	to hunger pains. Drew, you got any FUs? Yeah. First off, FU to shitty service at the Ardent
5107360	5117520	Air Mall today. Okay, 20 minutes to prepare a meal at the Hibachi. What the fuck? I order
5117520	5121960	somehow there's a line formed. Oh, let's not go to Panda Express. Look, let's go to the
5121960	5128920	Hibachi-san. Let's go to Hibachi-san, I said. There's no line, I said. Oh no. On top of
5128920	5134120	everything else, we try to get portraits taken and that shit takes an hour and a half, causing
5134120	5140720	us to be late for the show. I'm not too pleased. Also, fuck you to the weather, fuck it in
5140720	5147920	its fucking ear. I'm sick and tired of it. It's sunny and then suddenly it rains. Way
5147920	5155280	to end the week on a good note. Kim, did you have anything? FU to being sick. I hate being
5155280	5161640	sick on vacation. Sucks. Being sick does suck. All right. And Joe, do you have anything for
5161640	5171640	our listeners for Angst? Yeah, fuck being hungry. Fuck being hungry. All right. Anyhow,
5171640	5177960	let's get back into some gaming news. Dark Sakura. That was a very interesting way that
5177960	5188880	you just said my name. Dark Sakura. Okay. So Disney. Okay. Disney is bringing Spectrobes
5188880	5197880	Origins to Wii, supposed to be coming out in the fall. It's motion sensing, you know,
5197880	5203640	large real time battle thing, full 3D RPG world, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
5203640	5212000	So there are the two DS versions. Spectrobes and Spectrobes Beyond the Portals are already
5212000	5223240	everywhere. So it's more Spectrobes. Yay. The end. Yay, the end. It's supposed to be
5223240	5228000	pretty good. I don't know. I mean, it's not a game I'm remotely interested in, but from
5228000	5231680	what I hear, it's supposed to be pretty good. It's been popular, I guess. Is it maybe just
5231680	5236400	for a particular audience? Um, yeah. Well, what they're doing now, they're actually launching,
5236400	5240840	I think, a cartoon as well, which will help because it's kind of like Pokemon. I mean,
5240840	5248960	the very Pokemon Digimon-esque, so I don't know. Really not for my age group at all.
5248960	5253280	Wait, refresh my memory. Spectrobes, wasn't that gimmicky bullshit game where you had
5253280	5258180	to yell at the things to turn them into little monsters? I don't remember that, but it was
5258180	5263040	the one that had the special cards that you place over the DS touch screen where you tap
5263040	5269680	the spots and it will unlock different things. Oh. Yeah. So anyways, it's supposed to be
5269680	5274280	pretty decent. At least they're trying to be innovative with it. And, you know, maybe
5274280	5278720	they'll bring their D-gamer service over onto the Wii. That'd be pretty sweet, but I doubt
5278720	5285160	it. Doubt it a lot. Anyways, if you're not interested, though, in Spectrobes, there are
5285160	5291200	some rumors of other games that are coming out that might be worth it. Brutal Legends
5291200	5296900	is rumored to possibly be coming out to the Wii, and that's interesting. There's some
5296900	5302320	other stuff. Apparently, this is all from EA and Activision's 2009 lineup. Activision's
5302320	5308520	DJ Hero is tentatively scheduled for July. It seems like a weird time to put that out
5308520	5315320	if that were actually the case. Apparently, DJ Hero will feature a three- the peripheral
5315320	5320880	will feature three color buttons, a turntable, and a fader. Wow, if that's the case, they're
5320880	5327280	in for a lawsuit. This second Lego Indiana Jones game will be out, apparently, before
5327280	5332840	Christmas. I can see that. Activision will release a new Guitar Hero song pack around
5332840	5338920	the holiday season that kind of goes in line with- I think there was a Guitar Hero, like,
5338920	5342080	greatest hits or something like that they're planning on putting out, so that might make
5342080	5348240	sense. Star Wars Battlefront III is still alive, but probably won't be out until 2010.
5348240	5355760	Well, of course that makes sense, because even though- was it a pandemic? Who am I thinking
5355760	5360920	of? Ah, whatever. Still, a game like that, very epic. Of course they're going to make
5360920	5366640	another one. Those are all rumors right now. Rumors. Things that we might see a little
5366640	5376560	more of at E3. Yeah, well, going to the DJ Hero thing, you know, I've seen prototypes
5376560	5383560	of the other DJ game coming out, and if that's the case, if it's got a crossfader and stuff,
5383560	5387160	that makes me kind of wonder if it's, you know, there might be a lawsuit because their
5387160	5393800	controller looks very similar. Hmm, we'll see what happens. Well, Lego! Gosh, those
5393800	5397800	Lego games, they sure know how to sell. The Lego Batman, the Lego Star Wars, Lego Indiana
5397800	5405080	Jones. Well, guess what's next? Lego Prince of Persia. That's coming out of the New York
5405080	5409600	Toy Fair that happened, yeah? Apparently, you know, since they are doing the movie,
5409600	5412040	they're doing the Prince of Persia movie, right? They're going to have some Lego figures
5412040	5415440	in place that's actually coming out for the game. Now, keep in mind, the toys are being
5415440	5422520	based off the movie, not the game. Keep this in mind, these are just toys for now, but
5422520	5427400	you never know. Could be a game later on. Lego Harry Potter's the next one, for sure.
5427400	5432480	Well, other than Lego Battles, but in the Lego MMO. So, Lego Racers. No Lego Prince
5432480	5436680	of Persia game yet, but Lego Prince of Persia toys are definitely going to be happening.
5436680	5441120	I could see the new Lego Harry Potter game. I could really see that too. It makes sense.
5441120	5450400	The audiences kind of go hand in hand. So, crazy, I don't know, crazy fangirls for Legos
5450400	5456460	and Harry Potter. Anyhow, let's get into the mailbag. Every week we invite your emails
5456460	5461640	at mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks out a few of her favorites and reads
5461640	5467960	them here on the air for all of you guys to listen to us respond to. Veto. Or sometimes
5467960	5476240	Veto. Veto. Veto what? Veto this. Alright. Ooh, Rob. I mean, for great, me giving DarkSakura
5476240	5481240	the finger makes for great radio. Although Justin.tv can see it, so. Rob's a cheeky monkey.
5481240	5488120	Cheeky monkey. Alright, mails. Well, one's kind of a plug. After you saw this email,
5488120	5495560	I'm going to go ahead and plug it. A plug? Alright. We hear from Redertainment. Well,
5495560	5502280	we got an ask to plug book. I think he friended me on Facebook, so therefore you can plug
5502280	5509280	away. Okay. The Hawk by Hunter Red, which you can download for free at Redertainment.com
5509280	5514280	starting on March 1st. So go read it. What is it? Oh, it's a book? A novel. Oh, okay.
5514280	5524280	What a novel idea. Free distribution online. Make, you know, advocate literacy. Hey. So,
5524280	5531080	first actual email. I can see DarkSakura doing a PSA for reading. Read, goddammit! Read or
5531080	5540440	you're crap! Read something, you idiot! Illiteracy is stupid! Okay. Hi folks, just had a few
5540440	5548200	questions slash comments for tonight's show. Firstly, about the training cats for advertising,
5548200	5553200	what if something goes wrong? What if there's a, wait for it, catastrophe? Sorry, I just
5553200	5562220	had to go for the pun. It was too good to pass up. P. Additionally, with regard to you
5562220	5567000	and your wind complaints tonight, it could be worse. At least you folks don't have planes
5567000	5571160	crashing in your area, just in case other listeners don't remember me mentioning it
5571160	5575200	before. I live in Buffalo, New York. Also- Actually, we do have planes crashing in our
5575200	5579880	area. There was one that crashed I think in Elk Grove or something? It was around here.
5579880	5584660	I didn't hear about that. The guy was doing, was it take off and touchdown landings and
5584660	5589240	one of those landings he forgot to lower the landing gear and caught the plane on fire.
5589240	5593560	Don't! Oops. So no one got hurt. It was only one pilot. But still, it's a plane crash.
5593560	5602520	No one got hurt. It counts. That's a crash due to stupid. Also, in case you haven't read,
5602520	5606120	seen, listened to the news for the past few days, there was a commercial plane crash,
5606120	5610240	blah blah blah. Also, Buffalo lost Thursday night. Specifically, in the suburb of Clarence,
5610240	5615720	at least you're just dealing with wind. Yeah, you've been negated. If I may, and if Dark
5615720	5621220	Sakura has time to read this, I'd just like to say, hi, in quotes, to the Dark Fury Link
5621220	5627480	show on the Alexander server in Final Fantasy XI, add it! And specifically to Jaden, Nagiko,
5627480	5634200	and Digby Reloaded. Now go play a real game. That was from Spazinator. I'm just kidding.
5634200	5637680	I'm always so rude to my old game. Go play a real game, play Perfect World. I spent years
5637680	5641200	and years and years on Final Fantasy XI, just in case you guys don't know, so, you know.
5641200	5648720	And City of Heroes, I'm sorry, is WoW without the suck. It's WoW with Barbie. It's WoW with
5648720	5654200	superheroes. It's WoW with Barbie mode. It's fun! Oh my god, making the superhero, and
5654200	5659840	you can save them. Just let me know when the Hello Kitty beta comes out. It's so great.
5659840	5664160	I've made so many superhero costumes in the last week, because every time I would actually
5664160	5671640	try to log in and play the damn game, lose connection, log out. Fuck you. Don't. Anyway,
5671640	5675960	that's another story. Alright, was that it for mail? Last email. Oh no, one more, yay.
5675960	5679360	But jeez, I could just not read it. Hey, when I went in there earlier, there was only like
5679360	5685360	two emails, so I'm happy to hear there's more emails. It's actually from the same guy. Oh.
5685360	5689800	Because he sent the email late. Oh, there we go. I'll just read it anyway. Sure. Hi
5689800	5693680	folks, I just wanted to comment on a few things. Firstly, firstly is not a word, okay? Just
5693680	5702400	say first, or first of all, or in the beginning, no. FYI, I sent you an email last week during
5702400	5707520	the month. I only should have one R in it, thank you. But apparently, I sent it too late.
5707520	5714840	Not T-O-T-O-O, thank you. I'm sorry, you send late emails, you get graminated. Needless
5714840	5719920	to say, that it can be disregarded simply because I ended up calling in and repeated
5719920	5727160	what was in the email. Secondly, like, okay, Rob, your name is not Rob. I ended up getting
5727160	5732200	flowers too. Maybe he was drunk when he did the email. Maybe. I agree, it's a great game,
5732200	5736120	about flower. I agree, it's a great game, and very beautiful. Not only that, but it's
5736120	5740800	rather relaxing. I hate to call it a casual game, seeing as the term doesn't quite seem
5740800	5745640	to fit the game. Rather, I think calling flower a zen game seems to describe it a bit better.
5745640	5750320	By the way, here's an easy way to get two trophies for it. Play a level as normal, go
5750320	5755000	do something for ten minutes between levels, and bam, one trophy unlocked. Another one
5755000	5759360	can be unlocked by simply backing out of the game, fast forward the system clock by a week,
5759360	5762720	and re-enter the game, then you'll get the second trophy. What do you think though about
5762720	5768560	the analogy that it's a racing game? Flower's just a big fruity racing game. Um, I'm sure
5768560	5775040	the email, if it could, you know, grow sentience and speak on its own on behalf of Spazinator,
5775040	5781640	it would probably tell you, boobs. On an unrelated note, Rob commented that $60 for a game is
5781640	5787140	kinda expensive, especially if you're only somewhat into a given series. Well, I would
5787140	5792600	just like to point out that with the previous gen systems in their games, when taking inflation
5792600	5797020	into consideration, the older games are just as expensive as current gen games, and in
5797020	5801000	some situations, even more expensive. Well, thank you for allowing me to throw in my two
5801000	5805920	cents. Inflation, dude, it should be two bucks, and better bring chocolate with that. This
5805920	5810400	email is sponsored by GTA IV, Lost in the Damned, and Oscar Meyer, home of the Never
5810400	5817240	Ending Supply of Wieners. Okay, and you know, I'm only nitpicking just to, you know, be
5817240	5826880	a bitch, so. Alright. Hey, you heard it here first. I, like, apparently I like being a
5826880	5833040	rampaging bitch. Uh, let's see, bully maniacs in chat. Speaking of which, Sky, did you touch
5833040	5837360	on that last week? I didn't get home until way into the second part. Um, I don't remember.
5837360	5843360	What was the email about? Something? Uh, oh, Flower? I don't know. No, I didn't play Flower
5843360	5847960	until this week, so I don't think I talked about it last week. No, I was reading the
5847960	5854720	comment in chat. Next week's show is on the server, I just need to push it to the podcast
5854720	5859600	feed. We do it a little differently now on the new website, and I kind of botched the
5859600	5864580	first one, I think, so I'm being a little careful before I do 3.13. But I am trying
5864580	5871000	to get the podcast all caught up so people don't complain anymore. So, there we go. Alright,
5871000	5877080	let's move back into some gaming news. More emails, though. Mailbag, orangelaungeradio.com.
5877080	5887760	Don't send them. Don't send them. Send them, please. Okay. I'm being silly. Yes, apparently,
5887760	5893080	once again, there's more rumors pointing to the next Tony Hawk game using a brand new
5893080	5898640	skateboarding controller. I'm sure we're gonna see this at E3. I mean, it only makes sense
5898640	5906160	that they're gonna pull this stuff out. Apparently, Variety is saying, you know, kind of confirming
5906160	5913000	this, saying their sources show a new controller along with some details. Apparently, it won't
5913000	5917760	be about precise balance. Instead, it will be about grabbing and manipulating the board
5917760	5926720	to pull all sorts of tricks from which Tony Hawk games are known for. Interesting. Something
5926720	5932960	tells me that there's... I don't know. Why can't we just have the Tony Hawk Pro Skater
5932960	5938160	stuff where it was fun? It was whimsical. You're pulling off tricks in like a mall or
5938160	5942040	something ridiculous. Or why can't we just fire Tony Hawk out of a cannon at this point?
5942040	5946360	I mean, I'm just kind of done. It's not Tony Hawk's fault, okay? We can't... This is just
5946360	5951440	like the same argument that our actor ruins a movie. No, that may be the case sometimes,
5951440	5955800	but it's not Tony Hawk's fault. It's Activision's fault. Fine. Why can't we fire Activision
5955800	5962800	out of a cannon? I don't know. None of cannons. Will it blend? Yes, it will blend. It will
5962800	5969160	blend because the blending blades are made of the hairs from Chuck Norris' legs. Great.
5969160	5975840	Baron's chat has leaked into Orange Lounge Radio. And you know that that's not true because
5975840	5983320	there's nothing that could cut a hair on Chuck Norris' leg. Die! But he can make them out
5983320	5990820	himself and market them. Good point. I did not think about that. Anyways, yes. This will
5990820	5998920	be about as cool as that conversation right there. We'll have to see, I guess. But I don't
5998920	6003160	encourage any game being put out with some special controller because that just means
6003160	6007300	that they're going to be hard to find and expensive. Well, early in the show, Loki was
6007300	6010680	talking about House of the Dead Overkill because I think that was coming out this week, right?
6010680	6013760	It came out a couple weeks ago. Just a couple weeks ago and it's something that Loki wants
6013760	6015880	to play or something. I just remembered the name came out for some reason. It came out
6015880	6020780	last week. Ah, whatever. Anyway, here's the thing. The developers behind this game, Headstrong
6020780	6025040	Games, they have made it publicly known that they are interested in revitalizing one of
6025040	6031160	Sega's classic franchises, Virtua Cop. And this was in an interview with Cube 3. This
6031160	6036440	is the producer, Neil McEwen. He said they would love to do Virtua Cop or another light
6036440	6043240	gun game for Sega. So, there you go. Apparently, the whole House of the Dead thing came to
6043240	6047940	be when they were meeting with Sega about possibly doing a game in one of their franchises.
6047940	6052200	And House of the Dead is what was settled on. However, if they continue, and you know
6052200	6056280	this game does well, and they decide they want to do another game, could Virtua Cop
6056280	6061880	be a possibility? We'll see. I don't know how y'all feel about that, but it could be
6061880	6070000	interesting. So, we'll see. Do I gotta? Yeah, and Game Guru in chat says, uh, Sega, let
6070000	6077480	them do Virtua Cop. You know, Virtua Cop would actually be pretty fun. I had a lot of fun
6077480	6084000	playing it when it was new. Sorry. The whole Virtua series, they should just rename Virtua
6084000	6090120	Fighter to, oh look, another 3D fighter. Or Virtua Cop to, look, another gun game. Or
6090120	6096320	something like that. Anyway. Well, there's something wonderful that came out to Club
6096320	6102580	Nintendo members in Japan. It was special. They could get a Wii controller that looked
6102580	6112680	like an SNES pad, and now you can get one too for $75, courtesy of Playasia. But hey,
6112680	6122360	it looks just like a real SNES pad. Even though it's really a Wii classic controller. Whatever
6122360	6128800	the fuck. You know, I'll probably get one. The real deal. Or I'll just probably break
6128800	6137640	out my paint. Ooh, it does look pretty cool though. I don't know, it's kind of expensive.
6137640	6143320	You know what, you could totally rewire, I bet you anything, because keep in mind the
6143320	6148360	classic controller actually is in the shape of the Super Famicom controller, which was
6148360	6153520	slightly different shape than our Super Nintendo controller as you'll recall, right? You can
6153520	6160920	though get Super Famicom controllers at like, eBay anywhere really, and probably just reshell
6160920	6169600	it, you know, it's not hard at all. I'd do it. I'm a cheap bitch. That is, I don't know,
6169600	6173760	I'm kind of over the whole Wii Virtual Console stuff until they put something really good
6173760	6181460	on there, and yeah, so I'm just kind of, I don't really need this controller. We'll see.
6181460	6185600	I definitely don't need this controller, because I don't play Virtual Console games anymore.
6185600	6192840	You don't. Yes. Which is too bad. But, there's some other retro games that might be interesting,
6192840	6198920	including some fictional ones. D3, the publisher behind the new parody game, Eat, Lead, The
6198920	6203880	Return of Matt Hazard, is actually planning on releasing some of these retro parodies
6203880	6208840	on Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Network. It's supposed to be coming out this summer
6208840	6215000	at some point. No word on exactly what it is, but it'll probably be one of the in-joke
6215000	6220000	games that are going to be part of this game itself. I thought I heard a rumor that there
6220000	6224920	was going to be some of those games unlockable in, you know, Eat, Lead, so I don't really
6224920	6229320	know what they're going to be doing there, but I don't know. That'd be kind of neat if
6229320	6236520	they're good. But otherwise, you know, I think also it kind of, hopefully Eat, Lead does
6236520	6241160	well because otherwise you're going to have some spinoff of a game that sucked. No one's
6241160	6243560	going to really want to play it. So, we'll see.
6243560	6247640	I don't know much about this series, but I'm assuming this chat comment is in reference
6247640	6251080	to this. Game Guru says, Has Matt Karts will be interesting?
6251080	6257400	Yeah. Well, it's a fictional game series. Interesting. You know, speaking of like fictional
6257400	6260840	games and stuff, what is that retro game that came out on DS this week that sounds really
6260840	6263560	interesting, or last week I think it was? The Retro Game Collection or something like
6263560	6265120	that? Yeah, Retro Game Challenge, the Game Center
6265120	6268000	CX. That sounds kind of funny. I want to check
6268000	6270560	that game out. They have the sequel just came out in Japan
6270560	6275240	too, and it's actually one of the retro games, and it's actually like a 16-bit game now,
6275240	6279080	which is supposed to be a big deal. But it's interesting.
6279080	6283000	I like that they have like old magazines and stuff in there. Like, it's all made up.
6283000	6286680	There's another one. I don't remember what it was called now, but it was that PSP game,
6286680	6292160	the one that you play 30 seconds at a time. I saw a video on that, and it looks awesome.
6292160	6296200	It's so cheesy. I don't remember the name of it. We covered
6296200	6298320	it in a previous show. I remember talking about that though.
6298320	6304960	Yeah, I think Yusha 30. Yeah, Yusha 30. It looks awesome, so I'm looking forward to checking
6304960	6308560	that out, but there's like, you know, you have to go to towns and stuff like that, and
6308560	6313300	you really have 30 seconds in between each thing, but you can get more time if you like
6313300	6316600	visit certain people and stuff. And AcidicVampire in Chat says, Retro Game
6316600	6320000	Challenge is really good. I just got it this past week. This is why I like having a live
6320000	6323260	chat room during the show. You know, not a lot of podcasts can do this. There's some
6323260	6326380	out there, you know, some of the others that are on all games, but not a lot of podcasts
6326380	6330120	can do this, kind of interact and get answers live when we're stumped. Like, I don't remember
6330120	6334320	the name of that game. Somebody usually knows it, or we get instant game reviews on these
6334320	6340360	games we haven't, you know, we're too poor to check out. So, just loving the chat, chat.hornsonshortheday.com.
6340360	6345480	Anyway, let's talk about Quake Live, and this is one I am excited to check this out, because
6345480	6349480	this is the one, this is Quake, but now it's in your browser, and I guess it's going to
6349480	6351280	be free and ad-supported. I'm so excited about this.
6351280	6356360	Was this one based off Quake 3 or something? I think it is Quake 3, yes, but Quake Live
6356360	6361360	is apparently going to start the open beta this next week. All the statistics that are
6361360	6366960	being, that are on the server now, they're going to be kicked out from the closed beta.
6366960	6371200	Tuesday, February 24th is apparently when the open beta testing period is going to be
6371200	6378080	announced. Quake Live, again, is a web-based version of Quake. So, pretty exciting. I'm
6378080	6381760	sure they're going to change some things. I don't think it's just a port of the game,
6381760	6386100	but yeah, all you have to do if you want to check this out, just go to www.quakelive.com
6386100	6394680	on February 24th, and check it out, and maybe I'll be there playing, because I love playing
6394680	6399440	Quake back in my college days in the dorms. Quake and Quake 3, I mean, the original Quake
6399440	6403160	I'm a little more partial to, but I did love Quake 3. Quake 2, I did not get into.
6403160	6404160	Did you play ASCII Quake? Huh?
6404160	6405160	Did you play ASCII Quake?
6405160	6409720	Actually, I think I did. I seem to recall that, yes.
6409720	6413240	Well, here's some different joy. Joy has a much different variety for those of us who
6413240	6418120	have iPhones and iPod Touches. Rob, you're in the club. You'll be happy.
6418120	6419120	Yes.
6419120	6429240	Oregon Trail is going to be on the iPhone and iPod Touch, Gameloft is making it, and
6429240	6436560	you will be going from Independence, Michigan to Willamette Valley in Oregon, and it will
6436560	6441520	be available probably the end of this month or beginning of next, with no price announced
6441520	6450080	yet, but hey, it's Oregon Trail. It has skill-based minigames, and some of them use the accelerometer,
6450080	6451640	and you can die of dysentery.
6451640	6455400	I know. I was going to say, now I can ford the river wherever I go. That'd be awesome.
6455400	6456400	Yes.
6456400	6457400	Great.
6457400	6458400	It actually looks pretty good.
6458400	6463080	That's what Enfolded Raptor in our chat room says. Dysentery on the go. Somebody in our
6463080	6468400	chat room, I don't even know if I should say the name, because they were in the NDA beta,
6468400	6475280	and it says, everybody play it, the Quake Live, so apparently it's really good, and
6475280	6479080	I'm hearing a lot of endorsements for it, so sounds good.
6479080	6482840	All right, let's move on. Just a couple more stories, and we're going to open up our Skype
6482840	6487160	line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be opening that
6487160	6489640	very soon. We just got a couple quick more stories for you guys.
6489640	6494920	Yes, speaking of beta testing, Sony is looking for some new game testers as well. What will
6494920	6501280	you be possibly playing? A new game machine. Hmm. People are thinking that's going to be
6501280	6507640	either part of the Playstation Portable series, or possibly maybe even like a Playstation
6507640	6513200	phone or something like that. Could it be possibly the Playstation 4? I may have to
6513200	6517280	go early for that, but I can see maybe like the PSP 4000 or something.
6517280	6522560	Could it be a new enhancement to Playstation 3? Could it be like a new home, I don't know,
6522560	6527840	like a home type thing, like an expansion that all Playstation users will have? Is that
6527840	6532000	a possibility, or is this like hardware? It's going to be hardware. New game machine.
6532000	6536080	Interesting. It's probably a PSP version too. It says basically they're looking for someone,
6536080	6541500	it's a job listing on Sony Computer Entertainment, Japan's website. It says it's asking for someone
6541500	6547280	to evaluate and assess a new game machine. Ponzi in our chat room suggests it will be
6547280	6552360	the PS 2.5. Could it be yet another reiteration of the Playstation 2, you think?
6552360	6558440	Maybe, well not the PS 2, maybe like a new PSP, like kind of like the DSi that's enhanced
6558440	6560960	with the old stuff. They just had a new PSP, didn't they?
6560960	6564440	Yeah, but I'm talking about like when it actually redesigns the PSP.
6564440	6567640	Like a PSP part 2. Not like something that, oh look now it has
6567640	6571880	a microphone on it, that's retarded. Or, oh look, now it's a little bit slimmer. I'm talking
6571880	6577220	about something that actually, oh look, it's another analog stick. Or, you know, now the
6577220	6582280	screen's bigger and shinier, I don't know. Now I can make phone calls with it.
6582280	6588680	We'll see. I know, but every, you see, every time I hear about like gaming phones, I get
6588680	6593400	really nervous because I think about the N-Gage, you know, and just what a crap system that
6593400	6597520	was. What? The N-Gage was crap from the beginning.
6597520	6600400	But then the iPhone is kind of cool. Don't worry.
6600400	6603680	Super cool. Don't worry though, the Gizmondo is still
6603680	6607680	coming out, I think. I actually liked that game that I played
6607680	6612200	on the Gizmondo, the, the guitar game. That was pretty fun.
6612200	6614160	The Johnny whatever, was that what it was called?
6614160	6616480	Yeah. Wow, how do I remember that?
6616480	6619180	That was, it was actually a fun little game. Huh.
6619180	6624280	When I could hear it at E3 years and years ago.
6624280	6629840	One of the wonderful downsides to E3. Acidic Vampire says he wants the PSP to make
6629840	6632800	dinner and bring a beer. What?
6632800	6639440	I don't know. Game Guru, you were like, do you have an iPhone?
6639440	6643040	Because if you have an iPhone, you're allowed to, to make that assessment.
6643040	6647400	So, he said the iPhone is a lousy gaming device.
6647400	6650880	You're allowed to make that assessment if you've actually played games on one for a
6650880	6654320	significant amount of time. Alright, let me move on.
6654320	6656840	I got one more story, then we'll open up the Skype Live.
6656840	6660920	Maybe they'll call in, who knows. Hideo Kojima is going to get another Lifetime
6660920	6664320	Achievement Award. He's only 45 years old, by the way, but he
6664320	6669360	has met his Lifetime Achievement from the Game Developers Choice Awards, which are happening
6669360	6674000	on March 25th. So Hideo Kojima is going to be getting that
6674000	6676480	award. You know, because he kind of made Metal Gear
6676480	6681840	and all. So, kind of makes sense that, you know, he's
6681840	6684700	probably nominated for something like this and is getting this.
6684700	6688400	By the way, this is his second award in just a short time.
6688400	6693220	His first award was a Lifetime Achievement Award from the MTV Game Awards that wasn't
6693220	6695480	here in the U.S. That was in Germany, by the way, where Hideo
6695480	6699120	Kojima got that award. So, kind of interesting, because last week
6699120	6701640	I know we had a big story on the Metreon. We were talking about how the Metreon had
6701640	6705880	that Walk of Fame in it, and then, you know, now the Metreon's big Sony store is closing.
6705880	6708920	And we were wondering if they even did that Walk of Fame anymore.
6708920	6712840	Kind of, kind of goes hand in hand with that. I'm sure Hideo Kojima probably has a little
6712840	6715440	star or whatever they call it on that Walk of Fame.
6715440	6718880	But who knows? I do remember where that was, though.
6718880	6721280	I remember walking on that before they had anybody in it.
6721280	6723280	It was like an elevated platform, if I remember right.
6723280	6726800	It was kind of interesting. Anyhow, random story.
6726800	6732200	Now let's take your random calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
6732200	6735200	The Skype line is now open, and we'll get to those calls momentarily.
6735200	6738880	There's a little, like, gap between when we say something live and when they actually
6738880	6742560	go out over the radio. Oh, nope, we're getting a call already.
6742560	6746240	So we'll take this call, and then we'll get some last-minute stories.
6746240	6748560	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
6748560	6749360	Deathwishing.
6749360	6751840	Hello, Deathwishing. What's on your mind?
6751840	6753520	Street Fighter IV.
6753520	6756480	Yes. We were talking about that at the very, very, very top of the show.
6756480	6758480	Are you, I'm assuming you're a fan?
6758480	6760160	I just picked it up, actually.
6760160	6761920	You just picked it up?
6761920	6765280	I played it when I was, like, five, and I never really got serious at it, and I just
6765280	6770480	figured, time to get serious at it, and I get my ass beat, but I'm having fun getting
6770480	6771200	my ass beat.
6771200	6775280	Now, when I hear you say you haven't played it since you were five, I'm assuming that
6775280	6778560	means Street Fighter II, right?
6778560	6781200	It was a Street Fighter cabinet. That's all I know.
6781200	6784800	Wow. Because maybe it was, like, an old, old-school Street Fighter game. That one didn't even
6784800	6788400	play like any of the others, but all right. So, what, you've been playing this online,
6788400	6789360	and just getting your ass beat?
6789360	6791120	I've been playing as Sakura, pretty much.
6791120	6792400	Yeah? Do you have a-
6792400	6795520	Because too many Kens. Too many Ken Barbie doll people.
6796400	6798960	Really? I've kind of seen a mixture of people online. What about-
6798960	6799440	Play Dan.
6799440	6803360	I've played a- somebody was playing Crimson Viper. I played one of those.
6803360	6803680	Dan's homo.
6804320	6804800	And, uh-
6804800	6810160	What? If you can kick somebody's ass with Dan, then you are awesome.
6811600	6818320	Um, so, well, what about this whole accessibility thing, where, uh, you, uh, they say this game
6818320	6820720	is very accessible, and you say you haven't played this for a long time.
6820720	6821840	Like noobs? Like me?
6821840	6822340	Yeah.
6823520	6824800	I'm getting my ass beat a lot.
6825920	6827040	What about against the computer?
6827040	6830320	Well, against the computer, you can progress up. I've-
6831600	6835200	I mean, the AI in the game is ruthless, though. Holy crap.
6836160	6837680	Seth. My god.
6837680	6839920	Yeah, we were talking about how Seth is a bastard.
6839920	6840480	He's very-
6840480	6844720	All I know is, don't use the 360 controller for it. I have to use that.
6845280	6849360	It sucks. I almost got it on PlayStation 3, based on the controller alone,
6849360	6853200	but then I realized, I think I know, like, maybe two or three people playing it on PlayStation 3,
6853200	6856880	and I know far more on the 360, so I finally caved and got the 360.
6856880	6857680	Actually, I do have to say-
6857680	6862160	All I know is, like, if you want to play, it's like, invest in a fight pad,
6862160	6864800	because I heard those are really good, and they're like the Sega controller,
6864800	6868000	and then, like, the tournament edition stick is super accurate.
6868000	6870160	Like, you can just pull out the same move over and over.
6871520	6873680	Those little pads, they're good, too?
6873680	6874560	Yeah, we've got one.
6874560	6875040	Really?
6875040	6876080	Yeah, they're pretty good.
6876080	6877680	I'm gonna have to come to your house and test one.
6877680	6878720	Keep in mind, we first-
6878720	6880400	No, not your house.
6880400	6884880	We pre-ordered it on PS3, and we actually paid for a tournament stick,
6884880	6887040	and then we switched it to Xbox 360,
6887040	6889520	so we have to go find another way to get a tournament stick,
6889520	6894080	but in the meantime, Dan got the little fighting pad.
6894080	6895600	It's pretty good.
6895600	6897280	How was that the GameStop tournaments?
6897920	6898880	How was that?
6898880	6902640	I've heard some reports coming in from plenty of those around the country.
6902640	6903440	How did you do?
6904800	6906800	One beat five people,
6906800	6910320	then got beat by a guy who's ranked three in California.
6910320	6911040	Wait, wait, wait.
6911040	6913680	But you've not played the game since you were, like, five,
6913680	6915120	yet you did that well in the tournament?
6915120	6919600	Because I chose a place to go to that I knew people would walk in to be like,
6919600	6920640	oh, look, a tournament.
6921680	6923760	Oh, like at the mall or something?
6923760	6924320	Yeah.
6924320	6925680	Okay, that makes sense.
6925680	6926720	That makes sense.
6926720	6927220	Huh.
6928000	6929760	Plus I bought the games two days before it came out.
6929760	6930880	Wait, you said you were in California.
6930880	6931760	Where in California?
6932800	6933200	Southern.
6933760	6935360	Oh, okay, down in the LA area.
6935360	6937920	Well, you get lots of looky-loos in the malls down there anyway,
6937920	6938720	so it makes sense.
6939520	6942080	All right, well, anything else on your mind tonight, Death Wishing?
6942080	6945120	Um, Killzone 2.
6945840	6946880	Yeah, looking forward to that.
6947760	6951840	Um, I've actually saw there's someone on JTV playing it,
6951840	6954720	and it looks great, and I don't have a PS3,
6954720	6956720	and I'm a huge fan of the Killzone series.
6957440	6959920	Uh, you can get those demo codes, though, right?
6959920	6961280	But only if you, what, pre-ordered it?
6961280	6962800	Yeah, if you pre-ordered the game,
6962800	6964960	you could have got, like, the multiplayer demo or something.
6964960	6965460	Yeah.
6965920	6968160	Yeah, I think that's just the normal demo, actually.
6968160	6970320	Well, I saw some people giving away codes on Twitter for it,
6970320	6972480	so I know it must have been kind of hard to get, so...
6972480	6975440	It's not hard to get, you just create a European account and done.
6975440	6976560	Ah, Sneaky Sneaky.
6976560	6979120	I have it on my PS3 right now, I mean, so...
6979120	6979840	Sneaky Sneaky.
6980480	6981840	Thank you, British people.
6981840	6983280	Well, then maybe we need to,
6983280	6985680	we need to fire up Killzone and compete with the other channel.
6985680	6988800	No, I have no idea who else is showing it, but...
6988800	6991120	It's hot-blooded gaming or something, I don't know.
6991120	6993680	It's so interesting, when we first started on Justin TV,
6993680	6996480	there really was not a lot of gaming stuff on there at all,
6996480	7000640	but now there's tons of people just kind of showing what they play on there, so...
7000640	7002480	But, hey, props to them.
7002480	7005680	It's definitely expanded the community over there on Justin TV, so...
7005680	7007360	Alright, well, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls,
7007360	7008640	but thanks for the call, buddy, alright?
7008640	7009200	Alright, thanks.
7009200	7009760	Have a good one.
7009760	7010320	Have a good day.
7010320	7011120	And, yeah, you too.
7011120	7014240	And good job in the tournament, for, you know, that's still pretty good.
7015200	7015920	Noobs or not.
7015920	7017360	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio, who's this?
7019600	7022960	Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Agdeft.
7022960	7024720	Hello, Agdeft, how are you doing?
7024720	7026160	I'm pretty fine right now.
7026960	7027600	Awesome, awesome.
7027600	7031760	We have a little bit of lag, probably because of the fact that you are in another country,
7031760	7034960	so why don't you go ahead and ask us your question, or whatever you called in about tonight.
7037200	7041760	Well, I basically wanted to talk about Street Fighter IV here in Mexico, because
7043200	7049200	something pretty bad happened, especially with the collector's edition for PlayStation 3.
7050000	7050800	Please, tell us about it.
7050800	7055360	It's a pretty big shortage.
7057360	7058080	How did it happen?
7058080	7059120	How did the shortage happen?
7061440	7064960	Well, nobody knows how it happened.
7064960	7065840	It just happened.
7066720	7074400	Basically, most of the stores that had pre-orders for the Street Fighter IV version on the PS3,
7074400	7078720	the collector's edition one, basically got cut off by Capcom,
7078720	7086400	and they didn't get sent all the pre-orders they had in stock, or they had planned to sell.
7088160	7089040	That's so strange.
7089840	7092800	Were they redirected to the US to maybe meet demand?
7092800	7096480	And they were like, well, we could screw over other countries if we meet the demand here.
7096480	7097680	It seems a little odd.
7100240	7106480	Yeah, most people are thinking that, and that's pretty much it, because it got sold out in the US.
7106480	7113680	Screw Mexico, possibly, so I'm sorry for the PS3 owners that wanted the collector's edition,
7113680	7116480	because it's a pretty good one.
7116480	7120320	It's a pretty good deal you're getting on that box.
7120320	7122240	Yeah, that is kind of a bummer.
7123120	7126400	Sometimes we forget, we're kind of spoiled living here in the US sometimes.
7126400	7130000	Just out of curiosity, to kind of put it in perspective, how much would you be paying
7130000	7133920	for the collector's edition over there, for Street Fighter IV?
7133920	7146720	If I'm correct, I'm pretty sure it's around 1,500 pesos for the collector's edition,
7146720	7154640	and 1,000 for the regular edition, though most people on the, not to call it the black market,
7154640	7165440	but maybe what they call here at the Anglies, that would be a flea market or a swap meet.
7166080	7169600	They could sell it for over 2,000 pesos.
7169600	7175040	That would be like around $150 on the US.
7175040	7177440	Wow, yeah, I'm just looking at conversion rates right now.
7177440	7185360	It's about 10.8 pesos to the dollar.
7185360	7188240	So let's see, he said it would be about 1,500 to get it legitimately.
7188240	7190960	Divide that by 10.8598.
7191600	7194880	It's actually 1,450.
7194880	7198640	Wow, that's like $138 though, or 130 bucks.
7199280	7199840	Wow.
7199840	7200320	Yeah.
7200320	7204720	So sometimes we're a little spoiled here, so we have to remember that.
7204720	7208240	Well, you know, maybe next time you need to get some friends in the US
7208240	7210240	and just mail you the game or something.
7210240	7212480	You probably get it faster and cheaper.
7213360	7215600	Yeah, yeah, most possibly.
7216400	7223520	It's a good thing that I got the 360 version over at Amazon, so I'm not gonna worry about it.
7223520	7225760	Out of curiosity, I don't know if you know the answer to this or not,
7225760	7228240	but are you able to order games from the US?
7228240	7232160	Like say you can order a game from amazon.com in the US and have it shipped to Mexico,
7232160	7235680	or did they not do that?
7235680	7238800	I'm basically, I'm getting some help from my friend.
7239840	7242560	The game is going to be delivered over the US.
7243440	7248080	Since I'm pretty much next to the border, he can go and pick it up.
7248080	7250960	I just paid with my Mexican credit card.
7250960	7255920	That I can do, but I cannot get shipped games over here.
7256720	7260240	I can get movies and I think books, but everything else, no.
7260240	7267760	I do have to say, it's actually for Amazon UK, I can order books and they'll ship here,
7268320	7274160	but I can't order a game or a toy from the UK.
7274160	7276160	I'd have to ship it to a UK address.
7276160	7278560	Well, plus you'd get into region issues at that point, right?
7279360	7283920	Yeah, when I was trying to order Doctor Who toys, I couldn't have them shipped to me.
7283920	7284400	Bummer.
7284400	7285680	Because I wanted a Cyberman.
7285680	7288480	But we have listener friends in the UK that could help you out, right?
7288480	7288960	I'm sure.
7288960	7290480	All right, that's cool.
7290480	7291280	All right, well, act deaf.
7291280	7293840	We got to wrap things up and let you go, but do you have any other quick final thoughts
7293840	7295120	you want to get out there before we let you go?
7297920	7303040	Well, even though we got screwed on the previous version of the collector's edition of Street
7303040	7309040	Fighter IV, basically the rest of the world, Mexico, Japan, and Europe got the 360 Ring
7309040	7312240	controller that it has a definitely better D-pad.
7312240	7315840	I have two controllers here with me and they definitely work.
7315840	7320400	And it's basically the same controller as the white one that comes with the console.
7320960	7326960	Though the D-pad, you see it and it's the same, but you feel it and it's definitely better.
7326960	7332480	I really hope they think about Super Street Fighter Turbo with it and it's better.
7332480	7336000	I really hope they think about bringing that pad over here to the US.
7336000	7336560	That would be great.
7336560	7339520	But at least we have those fighting game pads that apparently are pretty good.
7339520	7340960	So I'm going to definitely check that out.
7341520	7342320	Anyway, act deaf.
7342320	7343280	Have a good one, buddy.
7343280	7346320	Thanks so much for the call and good luck on your quest for Street Fighter IV.
7346320	7349200	And sorry to hear that you guys got the shaft on that one.
7349200	7350080	That's always a bummer.
7350080	7350800	Take care, buddy.
7352240	7352800	Yeah, thanks.
7353440	7353840	All right.
7353840	7355360	If you want to give us a call, we'll take another one.
7355360	7358720	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7358720	7360400	But wait, we already have a call dropped in.
7360400	7361520	Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7361520	7362000	Who's this?
7362800	7366080	It's a kind of exhausted Jason.
7366080	7370320	Jason, am I exhausting you from all my needy tells about the podcast feed?
7370320	7371360	I'm like, I don't understand.
7371360	7372720	I follow Deep Man's instructions.
7372720	7373760	That just put it on the website.
7373760	7374880	It didn't put it on the feed.
7374880	7375680	Help me, Jason.
7375680	7377040	No, it's actually kind of weird.
7377040	7379440	I haven't, it's, I don't know.
7379440	7381040	And then it disappeared from the website.
7381040	7381360	I don't know.
7381360	7382800	I need to talk to Deep Man about it.
7382800	7383200	I don't know.
7384080	7384880	I'm confused.
7384880	7386960	But I have one more episode to get us all caught up.
7386960	7388720	And then I'm going to try and get tonight's episode up.
7389280	7390720	I don't know if it'll realistically happen tomorrow.
7390720	7392480	Tomorrow is my mother's birthday.
7392480	7396320	So I have to, you know, go out and spend some time with her.
7396320	7400480	Which by the way, if I am not mistaking, this is 68.
7400480	7401440	My mother's going to be.
7401440	7403040	So, yep.
7403040	7404240	Anyhow, sorry.
7404240	7405360	Not that everybody cares.
7405360	7407920	But anyways, Jason, what'd you call and talk about tonight?
7407920	7409920	I was going to say that your parents are old.
7409920	7413200	But at the same time, you are also older than me.
7413200	7413680	Yeah, I am 30.
7413680	7414640	By a fair margin.
7414640	7415200	So it kind of...
7416400	7417440	But my parents had me late.
7417440	7418960	My mom had me when she was 38.
7418960	7419840	No wait, that would make sense.
7419840	7421120	She'd have to be turning 69.
7422080	7423040	Wow, I'm a bad kid.
7423040	7424480	I don't even know how old my mom is.
7424480	7427600	But you know, it all starts to blend together after 65.
7427600	7429920	So yeah, I guess she's going to be 69, actually.
7429920	7432720	So anyhow, what'd you call in about?
7432720	7434160	Surely you didn't call in and talk about my mom.
7435440	7436080	I don't know.
7436080	7436880	That's kind of...
7436880	7442880	Anyways, the Tony Hawk story is kind of interesting.
7442880	7445760	Because the only thing that comes to mind...
7445760	7449200	There's only two things that come to mind when they talk about a custom controller.
7449200	7451760	The first one is the arcade cabinet.
7451760	7460160	The skateboard that Top Skater had in the entire arcade cabinet setup.
7460160	7464320	And then the only other thing that comes to mind is that since we have wireless controllers now,
7464320	7470160	something resembling like those tech decks that were really popular between 5 and 10 years ago.
7472160	7474240	Wow, I haven't heard about a tech deck in a long time.
7474240	7474960	Okay, okay.
7474960	7476640	Exactly, exactly.
7476640	7481760	And it's just kind of... I'm trying to envision myself...
7481760	7483120	First of all, I sucked with those things.
7483120	7485680	I couldn't do anything on those stupid things.
7486240	7492480	But no matter which way I try to think of it logistically,
7492480	7497520	it just doesn't seem to stick out as to any kind of a good experience.
7497520	7501360	I mean, the whole design behind Top Skater was that
7501360	7505920	the tighter timing you have to the best part of the jump, the better trick you do.
7505920	7510960	And there's only two, maybe three tricks you can do per thing of timing.
7510960	7513920	And that's whether you nollie off the front, ollie off the back.
7514480	7517360	And I think the angle might make a difference too or something like that.
7517360	7521040	Or the way that you shift the skateboard on its mount.
7521040	7524880	But it's just... it sounds so stupid to me.
7524880	7528560	Because we have a controller that works for this stuff already.
7528560	7532160	It's the same thing that I said with home on the PS3.
7532160	7535520	We have an interface, we have a system that works.
7535520	7537760	You come up with a stupid gimmick like this,
7538720	7541920	and it's going to artificially inflate the cost and be stupid.
7541920	7543200	This game is on the Wii, right?
7544000	7545360	Nope, PS3 and 360.
7545360	7547840	Wow, I was just saying, it's probably on the Wii.
7547840	7548400	It's another...
7548400	7549120	Well, it's probably going to be on the Wii as well.
7549120	7550800	They're used to stupid gimmicks over there.
7551360	7552480	Oh, I don't know.
7554800	7556080	It's just really weird to think about.
7556960	7562560	It's the unfortunate downside to Guitar Hero and Rock Band being very popular.
7562560	7568400	And the Wii, actually all three of those things getting popular roughly around all the same time,
7569040	7575440	has put this stigma out there that, wow, all these extra peripherals can sell like crazy!
7576240	7577760	And so now we've got things like this.
7577760	7583200	Not that the power pad is ever really something to legitimize at all,
7583200	7585840	but the... or rather the power glove.
7586800	7589120	The power glove, the track and field mat,
7589120	7595840	the... whatever that Sega Genesis controller beam, octagon...
7595840	7596400	Activator.
7596400	7597360	... was.
7597360	7598640	Wasn't it the activator?
7598640	7599040	Yeah.
7599040	7599600	Yeah.
7599600	7600880	I had an activator.
7600880	7602080	I know, they were awesome.
7602080	7604480	I just want to say, though, about the power pad.
7604480	7609120	That... the power pad was badass when I was a kid, because I was probably like,
7609120	7610640	you know, I'm a little older than the rest of you,
7610640	7614080	and I was probably like 9 or 10 when the power pad first came out.
7614080	7617600	We used to have a blast playing freaking track meet,
7617600	7621040	and I will... well, first off, I remember for the long jump,
7621040	7623360	the trick was you jump off the pad,
7623360	7627040	and then jump back on, fly just like so far,
7627040	7630800	but also the other thing would be short order and eggsplode.
7631360	7632560	That game was awesome.
7633280	7635120	I have never heard of that.
7635120	7636880	Short order eggsplode, look it up.
7636880	7639120	That's... that should be a classic game of the week sometime.
7639120	7640240	That was a power pad.
7640240	7643040	It was basically like... it was like Simon, you know,
7643040	7646480	like the... I remember that was one of it was the one game was
7646480	7649280	you had to make a burger by jumping around the pad
7649280	7651760	to different things to add the lettuce and all this stuff,
7651760	7653760	and then the other one... I swear to God, this is the game.
7653760	7655760	Oh, so it's like live-action burger time.
7655760	7658800	But it was kind of... it was two games in one,
7658800	7660960	because then eggsplode was something completely different,
7660960	7664720	which is basically like you step on the particular button to get the egg.
7664720	7665680	It was a little silly.
7666320	7666800	Interesting.
7666800	7667600	Dance Aerobics.
7667600	7670400	I played them all. I played all those power pad games.
7670400	7673200	I never had an NES, so my power pad gaming,
7673200	7676560	it was limited to the track and field, of course.
7676560	7677520	Right. Anyway, sorry.
7677520	7680720	I'm actually kind of glad to see somebody talking about the props...
7680720	7681920	about Prop Cycle.
7681920	7685280	That was... that was a big, expensive rig,
7685280	7686160	but that was a really good game.
7686160	7688000	I love Prop Cycle so much.
7688000	7689680	Prop Cycle gets props.
7690240	7691680	Did you have... no, look online.
7691680	7694880	Did you ever see the Prop Cycle that hooked up to an Addams Family pinball?
7696960	7698720	Trust me, just look it up.
7698720	7700480	What a pointless fucking combination.
7700480	7704000	It's... it's... it's brilliant and stupid at the same time.
7704000	7705120	Just... just look it up.
7706480	7708560	I'll find a link and put it in the chat room.
7708560	7709280	Sounds good to me.
7709920	7713120	You know, we... Dark Sakura, we need more content on the website,
7713120	7716480	and I'm thinking one thing you ought to do is like a brilliant but stupid column,
7716480	7717920	and that should be something that you put in there.
7717920	7718480	Okay.
7718480	7719360	Like in gaming.
7719360	7720560	Brilliant but stupid.
7722560	7723280	We'll see.
7723280	7725920	All right, Jason, any other quick thoughts before we let you go, buddy?
7725920	7731200	The GT... the GTA 4 loss in the damn controversy you guys were talking about before.
7731200	7731680	Yes.
7731680	7732320	The debate.
7732320	7733920	I'm so tired of it in general.
7734480	7738400	You know they did it just... just to see what would happen.
7738400	7739520	You know that's why they did it.
7739520	7740880	Because they don't make every layer.
7742000	7745120	If you make a person, the texture is closed.
7745120	7748000	Well, here's the other thing, and I should have brought this up earlier in the show,
7748000	7751520	because who knows how many people have actually listened this far two and a half hours in the show.
7751520	7752160	Here's the thing.
7752160	7756880	I bet they did it this way, because the peen isn't really on the disc.
7756880	7758240	It's not in the game.
7759200	7760640	It's in the download content.
7760640	7766240	It's almost like the reverse of hot coffee, where you had to like hack the disc or whatever.
7766240	7772160	You know, basically, you know, basically use the little code to unlock the sex scene.
7772160	7772640	All right.
7772640	7774640	It's like the complete reverse of that.
7774640	7778080	I feel like they almost did this just like... like they knew...
7778080	7779040	This is the finger.
7779040	7786000	They knew in the beginning they wanted to put the peen in the game, but they thought,
7786000	7788080	no, let's do it in the download content.
7788080	7791360	Because then people who get mad and want to take this game off shelves, well, it's not
7791360	7792480	really in the game.
7792480	7795280	You have to consciously pay to download or whatever.
7795280	7796240	A little weird.
7796240	7799040	Jason, did you see the picture?
7800560	7801440	No, I haven't.
7802400	7805200	I tend to stop clicking around and whatnot when I'm on a call.
7805200	7805680	All right.
7805680	7809120	Well, we'll let you go so you can go check that out and post your things in chat.
7809120	7811440	But thanks for the call as always, Jason.
7811440	7811920	Yep.
7811920	7814880	And thank you for my venting earlier when I couldn't get the podcast up.
7814880	7815600	Of course.
7815600	7818880	People sometimes forget you're a big part of this show as well, even though it may not
7818880	7821120	be your voice they have to hear for three hours every Sunday.
7821120	7823840	So how would you play that game?
7823840	7824320	All right.
7824320	7824880	Take care, Jason.
7824880	7825360	Night.
7827360	7830560	How would you be able to play Adam Sandler football like that?
7830560	7831520	You just...
7831520	7835840	You pretty much, as far as I'm aware, you're pretty much just running the machine while
7835840	7838160	you're on the prop cycle and triggering stuff.
7838160	7841120	Let's do a couple of last minute stories and we'll do one more call because we didn't take
7841120	7842080	a lot of calls last week.
7842080	7843840	So we'll get to like one more call tonight.
7844480	7845840	So yeah, Loki?
7845840	7846880	There's a contest.
7846880	7851520	Well, I don't know really if it's a contest, but basically Codemasters wants you to name
7851520	7857280	your baby Jason in the UK because they're trying to get their game Rise of the Argonauts.
7857280	7863360	They're trying to get Jason to the top of the UK's top 50 most popular baby names.
7863360	7864720	That is completely dumb.
7865680	7871280	And if you do name your baby Jason because of this, I hope you get your tubes tied soon
7871280	7871760	after.
7871760	7872000	Yeah.
7873600	7874480	Brilliant and stupid.
7874480	7875440	Not brilliant at all.
7875440	7876160	It's just stupid.
7876160	7876720	It's just stupid.
7876720	7877840	It's just stupid.
7877840	7882800	Now, if you name your kid Jason for other reasons, you know, you have a grandpa named
7882800	7884320	Jason or you just like the name.
7884320	7884960	That's fine.
7884960	7887600	But if you name it, Jason, because Friday the 13th.
7888320	7888800	All right.
7888800	7890000	Look, we got another call on the line.
7890000	7891040	I don't want to keep him waiting.
7891040	7891200	Hi.
7891200	7892240	You're on Orange Lawn's radio.
7892240	7892640	Who's this?
7893200	7893440	Yeah.
7893440	7894000	What up, guys?
7894000	7895280	It's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.
7895280	7895760	How you doing?
7895760	7896560	Xenocore, how you doing?
7896560	7897520	We haven't heard from you in a while.
7897520	7899040	How are things going at Ultimate Quest?
7899040	7900480	We haven't heard from Footy in a while either.
7901200	7901600	Yeah.
7901600	7905040	Lots of real world stuff is kind of hitting us all at the moment.
7905040	7906960	I moved and got a new job.
7906960	7909360	Footy's in the middle of finals, you know, this, that, the other thing.
7909360	7913600	So we are planning on coming back, but we got to get our real lives in order first.
7913600	7915840	I was going to say, I think you've got Star Ocean this week.
7915840	7919120	So you're going to need to get things together because that's, that's a big RPG.
7919760	7920960	Yeah, that's true.
7920960	7921760	That's true.
7921760	7926480	But I've been focusing in other areas since I was cut off from the interwebs, you know,
7926480	7928880	sort of need an internet connection to do the MMO thing.
7928880	7929120	True.
7929120	7934560	So I went back to some of my old conquests and dug up a copy of Falcon 4 after I heard
7934560	7937280	Tandric's mate mention it on his show the other day.
7937280	7944160	And on top of that, the new release of 40K Dawn of War 2 just came out.
7944960	7947040	Oh, that's, that's the Warhammer one?
7947040	7949200	Yeah, the Warhammer RTS game.
7949200	7949440	Yeah.
7949440	7951760	They just released version two.
7952800	7957520	That was that one that they, didn't they not put it on GameStop shelves because it
7957520	7959040	was coming out on Steam or something.
7959040	7961280	It was this whole thing going on back and forth.
7961280	7961520	Okay.
7961520	7961680	Yeah.
7961680	7962560	I know what this game is.
7962560	7962720	Yeah.
7962720	7963200	How is it?
7963840	7965040	Yeah, it's pretty good.
7965040	7970640	It's probably the closest to the actual figurine tabletop game yet, which for fanboys
7970640	7974000	like me is great, but for some other people, they don't like it too much.
7974000	7976480	It's more tactical than it is strategic.
7976480	7980400	Dark Soccer is not a big fan of the little figurines in Warhammer.
7980400	7983520	She went on a tangential, but that's just because of her prior relationship.
7983520	7985600	She was a lot years and years ago.
7985600	7988960	I've still heard rumors to the effect of Tyranids being incredibly broken.
7990640	7992960	Well, well, not so much now.
7992960	7996160	I mean, things are pretty well balanced.
7996160	7997040	It's just online.
7997040	8000560	You really have to pay attention to what you're doing because there is no base building
8000560	8000880	in this.
8000880	8003440	Everything is done by putting your troops out in the field.
8004400	8009360	So where you position them and what areas are looking in are a lot more important than
8009360	8010560	what they used to be.
8010560	8012480	Speaking of Warhammer, I have a random question.
8012480	8012880	I'm sorry.
8012880	8016880	This probably isn't what you called in to talk about, but Warhammer online, is this
8016880	8021600	turning into the next Age of Conan where like it has a huge launch, does very well, and
8021600	8028080	then, you know, like it's, I get the sense I'm getting is that Warhammer is kind of not
8028080	8033120	maintaining the large user base it had at get go or am I completely wrong?
8033120	8033840	Does anybody know?
8034640	8040640	Well, if you look at it, the guys who built Warhammer Mythic, I mean, they're known for
8040640	8045760	their PVP stuff from Dark Age of Camelot, and that's pretty much what this game is built
8045760	8046560	towards.
8046560	8051600	So if you're not into it for the PVP, you may not want to last as long because, you
8051600	8053520	know, there's only a 40 level cap.
8053520	8058080	You know, the end game comes a lot sooner, mainly to get you into PVP stuff.
8058080	8062320	So if, you know, going up against other players isn't your thing, then you're sort of going
8062320	8063840	to get turned off from it after a while.
8064880	8069760	And you run out of PVE content pretty quickly, or at least so I've heard from my friends
8069760	8070400	who play it.
8070400	8070800	Interesting.
8070800	8074160	I was playing it for a little while, and it's not that I dislike the game, but at the time
8074160	8076400	I was so sucked into WoW, I couldn't balance two games.
8076400	8077040	So I had to cut one of those.
8077040	8077920	Oh look, another public quest.
8077920	8079280	Oh look, same public quest.
8079280	8080000	Oh no, we were out of public quests.
8080000	8082800	You know, I thought those public quests were actually a pretty neat idea.
8082800	8083680	Like, that was kind of cool.
8084240	8089600	It had some neat ideas, so that's why I'm a little sad to hear it's bleeding out users,
8089600	8095600	but, you know, at the same time, if not everybody's in it for PVP, that could make sense, so.
8096160	8098560	But I don't think that it's going to go away, though.
8098560	8100400	I think it's going to stay above critical mass.
8100400	8104480	It'll just be one of those other ones that are just sitting quietly in the corner, like
8104480	8109440	EverQuest and EverQuest 2 and Planetside and all these other classic ones that are still
8109440	8109840	running.
8109840	8113120	Here's another game I played this week, I didn't talk about my gaming week, but I actually
8113120	8116480	went back and checked out Phantasy Star Universe for a little while, and you would be surprised,
8116480	8122240	on the Xbox 360, Block 1 and Block 2 are still full a lot of the times, especially during
8122240	8123200	primetime gaming hours.
8123200	8127920	You know, they still have, you would think that game would be completely dead, but they
8127920	8131040	still have a very loyal user base in there, which was amazing because they still have
8131040	8135200	Christmas decorations up, although I think they get away with it because they call it
8135200	8140560	Winter something, so technically it's still winter, but, interesting.
8140560	8146160	One other thing, did anybody in your area or anybody listening happen to get into the
8146160	8149600	GameStop Street Fighter IV competition that happened this weekend?
8149600	8151600	I did not go, did anybody in the room go?
8152400	8157120	I don't think so, but we did have a caller just a little bit ago talk about his experience
8157120	8159200	there in Southern California, but did you go?
8159200	8165200	Yeah, there was one in Jacksonville, luckily enough, I went in, got to Round 2, and I got
8165200	8169360	my ass, well, not handed to me, it was a 3-2 victory for him, but he's an old schooler
8169360	8173280	like me, so I didn't feel too bad about it, and he actually ended up winning the store,
8173280	8174880	so I was content with that.
8174880	8177440	Well, if you're going to lose to someone, lose to the eventual winner, I suppose.
8178160	8179360	Exactly, exactly.
8179360	8182640	That's what I felt, like, back in the days of DDR, like, I don't know if a lot of people
8182640	8186400	know, but I used to do Perfect Attack in DDR in tournaments and stuff, and, you know, like,
8186400	8189280	I came in fourth, which was probably as high as I would go in some tournaments, but, you
8189280	8193120	know, usually when I would lose, I would lose to the person who would eventually win, so
8194160	8195120	it didn't feel so bad.
8195760	8200480	So, those were the days, oh man, I wish I could do some of that now, but now if I probably
8200480	8205600	played a 9-footer on DDR, I'd be like, where's my inhaler?
8206640	8210880	So, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Xenocore, before
8210880	8211440	we let you go?
8211440	8217840	Yeah, just that, that feeling of being in the tournament, everybody talking smack, all
8217840	8223520	waiting for their turn, and getting sent home, crying, I miss that from the arcades, that
8223520	8226240	needs to come back, but that's pretty much it, that's all I have, guys, so.
8226240	8229120	We'll see, maybe they'll do some more of this, we'll see.
8229120	8232640	All right, well, Xenocore, take care, buddy, and have a good one, and good luck with Ultimate
8232640	8233440	Quest, come back soon.
8234960	8238720	All right, we're going to go ahead and close the Skype line for now, because we've taken
8238720	8241600	lots and lots of calls tonight, and we still have a cage match we've got to get to at some
8241600	8247680	point, and yeah, I heard one of our, one of our frequent listeners and callers, TheRobD,
8247680	8250960	apparently did pretty well in this tournament.
8250960	8254080	I don't know if he won his store, or runner-up, or whatever, okay, what are you laughing about,
8254080	8254880	DarkSira?
8254880	8256400	Just the prop cycle.
8256400	8258080	Oh, you nerd.
8258880	8261760	All right, so yeah, I was just reading about that in chat, and it reminded me, because
8261760	8266000	I saw a LiveJournal post to his that said that he did pretty well, so congrats to him,
8266000	8270000	and apparently he's got, he's like, I'm sure he's number one on my friends list and stuff
8270000	8272240	online, he's pretty insanely good at Street Fighter.
8272240	8275360	I have to play him once and lose to him, just for the little factor.
8276640	8279520	All right, Loki, any other last minute stories you want to get to?
8279520	8286160	Yeah, it's rumored that, or I guess Sony is saying God of War 3 and MAG are coming within
8286160	8293120	the year, of course, MAG being that massive action game, and these will be like blockbuster
8293120	8300320	exclusives, and yeah, no word on when they're possibly going to come, although if I were
8300320	8308640	a guessing man, perhaps God of War 3 might be coming out around July-ish, but we don't
8308640	8311680	know, so it's just a guess.
8311680	8313440	Summer's a good time to release games.
8313440	8321680	July especially, there's what, NCAA football and NCAA football, that's about it, at least
8321680	8323280	for July.
8323280	8330480	Well, Braid, we talked about that earlier in the show, and if you thought $15 was too
8330480	8335200	much for Braid, well, you're in luck, they're dropping the price this week to 800 Microsoft
8335200	8337440	points or $10.
8337440	8340320	Great for sales!
8340320	8343120	Haven't played it yet, you get a chance to play it now.
8343120	8344320	I had a story, too.
8345440	8346880	Oh, well, Dr. Stalker, go ahead.
8348080	8349600	Just jump right in there, cut Loki off.
8349600	8352080	Oh, he does it to me all the time, I thought it was fair.
8352800	8355200	I'm kidding, go ahead with your story, I was actually just trying to remind you that I
8355200	8356080	had one later.
8356880	8362480	Apparently, Microsoft overpaid some layoff severances, and now they want their money
8362480	8376080	back, and I guess in administrative error, they had meant to pay off their 1,400 employees
8376080	8380640	that they had just recently laid off, but they actually had put a little bit too much
8380640	8386080	money in their severance packages, and they now want it back, and it says, according to
8386080	8391760	this, we ask that you repay the overpayment and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience
8391760	8392400	to you.
8392400	8394480	Yeah, I know, just a minor inconvenience.
8395040	8397280	That's kind of messed up, I don't know.
8398560	8400560	All right, yeah, you know what's funny?
8401280	8404240	I actually had something like that happen to me once, I don't want to say at what job,
8404240	8408560	it was a long, long time ago, long, long time ago, like I was younger, and they totally
8408560	8412800	overpaid me on my last check, and not by much, but like a hundred bucks, but when you're
8412800	8414560	like 18, that's a lot of money.
8414560	8420240	So, you know, thankfully they didn't ask for it back, because at that age, I don't know
8420240	8421200	how I would have paid that back.
8422400	8423920	So, anyhow.
8424560	8427520	All right, Jamie, why don't you go ahead and do your last minute story?
8427520	8428640	It's a little dumb story.
8428640	8429360	Sure, go for it.
8429360	8434160	It was actually, it was not dumb, because it was linked to me from Alpha Cananagram,
8434160	8439520	in chat, that they're selling Noby Noby Boy shirts at panic.com.
8440080	8440800	Nice.
8440800	8446000	They're funny, there's the 12 inch version, the 24 inch version, the 48 inch version,
8446000	8448320	and the 144 inch version.
8448320	8452320	See, they should have like the head actually start up here, like at the center of the neck,
8452320	8456160	and then like it just loops around, and then the back is actually like on the back center
8456160	8456880	by your bum.
8456880	8457520	Did you see these?
8457520	8458160	It'd be awesome.
8458160	8459040	No, I didn't.
8459040	8460240	I'll link it in the chat room.
8460800	8461200	All right.
8461200	8464800	Okay, there it is.
8464800	8466640	They're pretty epic.
8466640	8467520	Let me look at that right now.
8467520	8471760	This is at panic.com slash good slash Noby Noby dot PHP.
8471760	8473120	Free advertising for them.
8473120	8473600	Look at that.
8473600	8474480	Oh wow, I see.
8475600	8476400	They're hilarious.
8476400	8479120	They look like a giant scribble on a shirt.
8479120	8480080	They're hilarious.
8481280	8484800	Oh my god, it's like somebody just did a giant scribble on a shirt, and they're gonna make
8484800	8485840	tons of money off of it.
8485840	8487040	That's so not fair.
8487040	8487680	But they're cute.
8487680	8488080	They're very cute.
8488080	8491600	I do have to say, though, in terms of design, I actually like how the page is laid out.
8491600	8493280	Yeah, I like the pink and black one.
8493280	8495760	I'm talking about the background graphics.
8495760	8496320	That's cute.
8496320	8497200	It's actually really cute.
8497200	8497920	Really good idea.
8497920	8498320	There you go.
8499600	8500160	All righty.
8500800	8501680	Loki, do you have any more?
8503040	8505200	Uh, I think that's it for right now.
8505760	8506720	Uh, let's see.
8506720	8511840	Oh yes, I remember tiger hugging me this one at the beginning of the show and uh, got sidetracked.
8512400	8515280	Uh, one of the quick thing you hear about a denial service attack.
8515280	8519200	Apparently, those against Xbox Live, they've actually responded to what's been going on
8519200	8520000	about this.
8520000	8526080	Uh, apparently, uh, these hackers were going in there and doing some type of weird denial
8526080	8527200	of service attack.
8527200	8532080	Um, and it would boot Xbox Live people off of the network, actually.
8532080	8535840	Uh, Microsoft has responded saying that basically you should contact your internet provider
8535840	8537920	if this is happening to you.
8537920	8542320	However, they are threatening to ban any hacker that gets involved in it.
8542320	8545600	Uh, quote, this problem is not related to the Xbox Live service but to the player's
8545600	8546640	internet connection.
8546640	8550160	The attacker could also attempt to disrupt other internet activities such as streaming
8550160	8552560	video or web browsing using the same tool.
8552560	8556160	And uh, Microsoft just kind of wants to remind people that hey, Xbox Live is like any other
8556160	8557120	internet service.
8557120	8562160	So somebody is attempting to uh, hack you in that regard or I guess more like spam you
8562160	8564160	I think would be a more appropriate term.
8564160	8567840	Uh, it could affect Xbox Live just like it would affect anything else you do on the internet.
8567840	8568640	So be warned.
8568640	8573520	And uh, if you're doing that to people, unless they really deserve it, you're lame.
8573520	8576480	If you're doing it to people just randomly, then you know, you're lame.
8576480	8579680	But if you're doing it to people because they really deserve it, then okay.
8579680	8581600	But just be careful.
8581600	8584320	Apparently they're doing it to people because they lose to them.
8584320	8585520	Oh, see that's lame.
8585520	8586080	It's like, okay.
8586080	8586720	Get over it.
8586720	8587440	You've lost.
8587440	8588480	I don't, I don't like you.
8588480	8590960	I'm going to DDoS you.
8590960	8592000	QQ some more.
8592000	8592960	Cry me a river.
8592960	8595520	Yeah, die in a fire if that's you.
8595520	8598160	I mean, it just, you know, why are you playing games online?
8598160	8601840	If, if you can't handle losing, don't play games online.
8601840	8604560	Why else do people play games to piss other people off?
8604560	8608400	I fucking hope like Seth for real comes into your house and beat you up.
8608400	8610640	Like that's what I hope for those people.
8611600	8612560	All right.
8612560	8615760	If that's it for the last minute stories and let's go around and get everybody's final
8615760	8618720	thought for the evening, uh, and wrap up the show for tonight.
8618720	8620960	We can get to the, uh, live after birth.
8620960	8624400	Uh, Drew, thank you for being here tonight.
8624400	8627520	I'm sorry you didn't get to say more on the show and happy Pi Day.
8627520	8628320	Pi Day.
8628320	8630880	You guys brought pie and we'll probably enjoy it during the after birth.
8630880	8634000	Although I don't know if we have a lot of forks, but I can't have any, but you guys
8634000	8635040	can all have some.
8635040	8638000	It is episode three 14 or Pi Day.
8638000	8638960	So happy Pi Day.
8639600	8640800	Uh, Drew, any final thoughts?
8643600	8646320	Kim, thank you for being here and hope you feel better.
8646320	8646880	Take drugs.
8647600	8647840	All right.
8648720	8649360	Lots of drugs.
8649360	8650960	And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8651920	8653520	I hope you guys enjoy the pie.
8653520	8654160	All right.
8654160	8655760	We do punch and pie.
8655760	8658640	I don't have punch, but I have apple juice, so it'd be juice and pie.
8659520	8660080	All right.
8660080	8662400	Uh, Joe, thank you for being here.
8662400	8663360	Dark Tetsuya.
8663360	8666720	Thank you as always for your contributions to the website and a lot of folks don't know,
8666720	8669120	but you actually contribute a lot of the stories to the show every week.
8669120	8670320	So thank you for being here.
8670320	8670880	Of course.
8670880	8672480	And do you have any final thoughts?
8672480	8674320	I hear you're popular on the internet.
8674320	8675440	I'm popular on the internet.
8675440	8676640	Yes, I am popular on the internet.
8676640	8677680	You bastard.
8677680	8678080	All right.
8678080	8680720	Uh, Loki, what's your final thought for tonight?
8680720	8686000	Um, final thought is I need to play more Nobby Nobby voice.
8686000	8688320	Now that I actually know what I'm supposed to be doing in it.
8688960	8695280	Although why only complain that camera fucking sucks and no, we know we boy poop more.
8696000	8701440	I do need to poop more in the parakeet.
8702400	8704480	My has a space squirrel.
8704480	8708080	It's the best in the squirrel has little antennas with sparkles on it.
8708080	8710800	I mean, it's absolutely awesome.
8710800	8711040	All right.
8711040	8713840	My space squirrel, the miniature giant space camps.
8713840	8714400	I demand.
8714400	8716400	Namco makes space squirrel the game.
8716400	8719920	My final thought is our headache, et cetera.
8720960	8725760	And I'll probably get Nobby Nobby boy so I can poop, but flower fruity racing.
8726320	8726800	Amazing.
8727360	8728000	Dark Sakura.
8728000	8730080	Last but not least your final thought.
8731600	8736240	Um, no, no.
8736240	8737600	Is your final thought?
8737600	8738320	No means no.
8739200	8739600	All right.
8739600	8743280	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and listening to orange lounge radio.
8743280	8744400	We really appreciate it.
8744400	8745360	You know, it's true.
8745360	8750160	This isn't just a line without, you know, you guys, uh, we wouldn't exist because it's
8750160	8751520	all about independent podcasts.
8751520	8754400	So if you enjoy what you hear, all you have to do, help us spread the word.
8754400	8756000	Tell two people about the show.
8756000	8757600	Leave us a nice review on iTunes.
8757600	8758320	Help us spread the word.
8758320	8759200	That's all we ask.
8759200	8761360	We don't put advertising in the show or any of that stuff.
8761360	8764560	We just give up our time on Sunday nights because we like it.
8764560	8768720	It's fun and we like attention and we like to be popular on the internet.
8768720	8769200	Right, Joe.
8769760	8771920	All right, so that's it.
8771920	8773520	Thank you guys so much for listening to us tonight.
8773520	8774240	Have a good one.
8774240	8776720	And thanks for listening to orange lounge radio.
8776720	8777520	We'll see you next week.
8778160	8781360	You've been listening to orange lounge radio.
8781360	8787120	Orange lounge radio is an orange lounge production to join us for a live show.
8787120	8794240	Visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6 PM Pacific time.
8794240	8799200	The views and opinions expressed on orange lounge radio do not necessarily reflect those
8799200	8805280	of the entire staff of orange lounge radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right
8805280	8805840	anyway.
8806400	8807360	See you next week.
8816000	8816320	You know what?
8816320	8818480	I'm going to do something we don't usually do in the afterbirth here.
8818480	8821920	I'm going to make an outbound call because I saw someone join chat and I want to talk
8821920	8822080	to him.
8822080	8824160	Maybe I'll leave this in the podcast for fun.
8824160	8829200	Usually we do a little live only thing after the show and play some copyrighted music,
8829200	8830960	but tonight we'll do something special.
8830960	8831760	Hi, Rob.
8831760	8832320	It's Rob.
8833360	8833760	Hi.
8833760	8834080	Hi.
8834080	8834560	How are you?
8835680	8836720	A little bit surprised.
8836720	8838960	This is the first time orange lounge radio has called me.
8838960	8842240	Yes, it doesn't happen very often, but I saw you join chat.
8842240	8844480	You had incredible timing and joining chat.
8844480	8846480	And my first thought was, were your ears burning?
8846480	8847920	Because we were just talking about you.
8847920	8852640	No, actually, I just came in after a little bit of Street Fighter 4 and a little bit of
8852640	8853200	homework.
8853200	8856800	Well, no, the reason why I ask and why I'm putting you on the spot a little bit is because
8856800	8860480	some folks called in talking about their local Street Fighter 4 tournaments, and they were
8860480	8862320	talking about how they got beat and all this stuff.
8862320	8865280	And then I thought, you know, I think Rob has a different story about how the Street
8865280	8866480	Fighter 4 tournament went.
8866480	8870160	So I actually want to call you and ask you, how did the Street Fighter 4 tournament go
8870160	8870480	for you?
8871040	8872560	I moved on to the second round.
8872560	8875120	I've got that little blue sheet that says KO first round.
8875120	8876240	You get to go to the second round.
8876240	8877520	So yay me.
8877520	8880880	How does that, does that mean you won the store or did the top three get to go or what?
8883200	8884000	Well, here's what happened.
8884000	8888320	I actually made it to, I lost in the winner's bracket to the guy who eventually made it
8888320	8889840	to the, well, who eventually won it.
8890480	8894880	Then I won the loser's bracket, faced him again in the grand final, so to speak, and
8894880	8895680	lost to him again.
8895680	8897680	And the sad thing is it won three rounds every time.
8898800	8899360	Really close.
8899360	8901760	We actually both played Ryu because we're both Ryu bitches that way.
8902400	8905040	And it was really, really a good match.
8905040	8906000	And it could be on either way.
8906000	8909360	And I screwed up a few times and he screwed up a few times, but I ended up losing to him
8909360	8910240	twice, sadly.
8910240	8912480	I was going to ask who your character of choice is.
8912480	8914480	So it's Ryu is your, is your, is your guy?
8915200	8916240	Uh, let me put it this way.
8916240	8919040	My aim screen name is Ryu Rob D. So yes.
8921120	8921680	Very nice.
8921680	8922240	All right.
8922240	8923440	See, I don't know what it is.
8923440	8925280	Like I'm trying to feel out different characters.
8925280	8927120	And like back in the day I used to be Chun Li.
8927120	8932480	Like, you know, you know, I love Chun Li and that was the one I used to use all the time.
8932480	8937520	But now like the, I, after Super Street Fighter 2 and everything, I think I really like Fei
8937520	8940160	Long, especially after playing him in Street Fighter 4.
8940160	8940800	But here's the thing.
8940800	8947040	I am so challenged by the controls in freaking, you know, the Xbox 360, cause it's really
8947040	8950640	hard on that little D pad to do three fireballs all in a row.
8950640	8954400	So I was going to actually ask you next, how do you get around the control issue or have
8954400	8956240	you stuck it out with the D pad?
8956240	8957600	Did you have to use the D pad in the tournament?
8957600	8958560	I stuck it out with the D pad.
8958560	8959840	I'm really used to it at this point.
8959840	8964480	And it really has calloused my thumb entirely, but I'm used to it at this point.
8964480	8965920	So I can actually do pretty much anything.
8965920	8968560	I can do even Zangief's Sweetie and Pilot Driver.
8968560	8968800	Oh my.
8968800	8973520	Quarter circle forward, the double quarter circle forward motions are still eluding me
8973520	8973920	a little bit.
8973920	8978880	At least when I'm doing the Shoryuken focus, attack, dash, cancel into the end of Ryu's
8978880	8979520	Matsuha Doken.
8979520	8983840	Meaning I'm doing a forward quarter circle forward motion, hitting the medium punch and
8983840	8987600	kick buttons together, hitting forward forward again to dash, and then two quarter circle
8987600	8991200	forwards and a punch, all while the opponent is flying up in the air and coming down.
8991200	8992400	You just fucking lost me.
8992400	8992960	But that's all right.
8994400	8997680	I'm assuming that's just massive death right there.
8997680	9001600	Some type of massive death.
9001600	9002000	All right.
9002000	9002880	Well, hey, you know what?
9002880	9003760	Congratulations to you.
9003760	9004560	That's pretty awesome.
9004560	9007680	And I wanted to hear about the whole, how it went.
9007680	9009920	Because we had a couple of people calling in saying, yeah, I lost.
9009920	9011040	Yeah, I lost.
9011040	9012400	So well, good luck around too.
9012400	9014560	Are you going to be able to make it out there for round two, you think?
9015520	9015920	Probably.
9015920	9019520	I have a couple of people saying that they'll actually drive me, which as a poor college
9019520	9022240	student with no car is a good thing.
9022240	9026160	Actually, the funniest story I heard about the tournament this weekend is this could
9026160	9029120	just be someone bullshitting on an internet message board.
9029120	9033200	But supposedly someone was at a tournament, and he's like, oh, we're just in some small
9033200	9033840	little town.
9033840	9034640	This will be easy to win.
9034640	9037840	And then all of a sudden they're like, OK, first round we've got Justin Wong.
9038480	9039600	Can he come to station A?
9040160	9044000	And if you don't know who he is, he's a famous Marvel versus Capcom 2 player.
9044000	9045760	I think even I've heard that name.
9045760	9047120	Even I've heard that name.
9047120	9047680	They used to do it.
9047680	9051360	We used to have an arcade here in Folsom that did huge Capcom events.
9051360	9055360	So we would kind of like we had a DDR tournament there years ago, and it was still open.
9055360	9056640	So that is funny.
9057280	9059920	Well, how unlucky do you have to be really?
9060560	9061040	How funny.
9061600	9064560	Hey, one other question I want to ask you, since you're the best Street Fighter 4 player
9064560	9064960	I know.
9066960	9067600	Thank you.
9067600	9069680	We don't have a lot on the show.
9070640	9074400	My question is, what are some tips for those of us that consistently get our ass kicked
9074400	9076400	by Seth who suck at the game?
9077360	9078800	Any advice for us to get better?
9079680	9082720	Certainly stay out of throw range when he wakes up, because what he likes to do is do
9082720	9085200	that stupid Shoryuken spinning pile driver move.
9085200	9088160	So staying a couple steps away from him when he wakes up would help a lot.
9089360	9092880	Really wait for him to make a move and then sweep him, because the computer is very vulnerable
9092880	9094720	to that, especially on the easier difficulties.
9094720	9098000	And really just use your safest moves against him.
9098000	9101520	Any tips for online in the non-Seth type battles?
9101520	9106640	Online, for the Ryu players, let them make mistakes, because they're usually aggressive
9106640	9110640	and most of them can't even Shoryuken, so they're vulnerable to air attacks.
9110640	9115680	Most of their game usually revolves around just trying to attack as much as possible,
9115680	9117680	so a patient player can do a lot.
9118320	9120800	Is Crimson Viper a cheap bitch, yes or no?
9121840	9123520	No, she's only got one effective move.
9123520	9124560	That stupid shock move.
9126240	9129520	But sometimes when you're fighting her, at least when you're new, the fact that she's
9129520	9133200	the only character I can think of that can hit you instantly from so far away like that,
9133200	9137520	like I was not used to seeing that in Street Fighter, so I thought that was a little cheap.
9137520	9139040	But yeah, she's interesting.
9139040	9141840	I like how she resembles Vanessa a lot from King of Fighters.
9141840	9142320	I have no idea.
9142320	9145920	I'm telling you, does she not look like an SNK character?
9145920	9148000	We were talking about this at the beginning of the show.
9148000	9152160	She absolutely does, especially since she's got the red hair, she's a special agent type
9152160	9153280	character, that sort of thing.
9153280	9155200	It's funny for her, I think, but hey.
9156160	9156800	All right.
9156800	9160240	All right, well, Rob, we're going to let you go and get to the rest of our after show or
9160240	9161920	actually close the podcast at this point.
9161920	9164880	So thank you very much for letting us harass you and surprising you with a phone call and
9164880	9166240	telling us about your experience.
9166240	9166960	Always a pleasure.
9166960	9167920	Have a good night, guys.
9167920	9168480	Take care, Rob.
9169840	9172880	All right, so now the podcast is really over.
9172880	9187120	Good night.
