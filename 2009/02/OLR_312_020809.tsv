0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	19000	Tonight, February 8th, 2009, will Netflix on the 360 get a premium upgrade,
19000	22000	Time Crisis debuts on the iPhone,
22000	25000	and is President Obama a new character in Street Fighter?
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	41000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41000	46000	Here I am, Rob Roberts, with you every week, and also joining us, say hello to the one and only,
46000	48000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	52000	Back from her gray, wait, we didn't hear you, is the mic on?
52000	58000	It is now! Alright, there we go, back from the dead to join us here on Orange Lounge Radio
58000	61000	because she's been out a couple weeks. It was gray, very gray.
61000	65000	Oh yeah, you went to Prosser, Washington, Party Central America, how was that?
65000	67000	I went roller skating.
69000	72000	People did roller skating to be cool like 20 years ago.
72000	75000	I love roller skating, but I found out something very depressing, Rob.
75000	79000	What's that? Since I had, the last time I went roller skating was four years ago,
79000	82000	I went with Jessica, of all people.
83000	89000	Oddly enough, having two car accidents where your hip gets injured means it's really hard to roller skate.
89000	96000	Especially when you're going one way and you're having to balance with your right leg and it hurts and ow.
96000	99000	Ow. So yeah, I murdered myself.
99000	101000	But I played lots of stuff.
101000	104000	We'll talk about that in just a minute, but I have to introduce everybody else who's here.
104000	106000	Say hello to the one and only, Tech Master, Loki.
106000	108000	Hi. Hi, how are you doing, Loki?
108000	109000	I'm doing fine.
109000	111000	Yeah? Fine?
111000	115000	Well, I was in Oakland all day, so you can't really recover from it.
115000	116000	And you didn't get shot?
116000	117000	I didn't get shot.
117000	118000	Congratulations.
118000	124000	Alright, we are very excited tonight here because if we sound giddy, it's because finally after like six weeks of being gone,
124000	126000	we're finally back on Justin TV.
126000	128000	So hi to everybody who's watching us there on Justin TV.
128000	130000	Justin TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.
130000	135000	Though again, I don't know why people want to watch us doing a radio show, but people seem to want to do it.
135000	138000	But the reason why I'm giddy is because the audio now works.
138000	140000	And let me explain how this works real quick.
140000	142000	The audio now works that they hear us through the mics.
142000	145000	So the sound quality on Justin TV during the show is a lot, lot better.
145000	147000	But I want to point this out.
147000	150000	They're not going to hear the music or anything else.
150000	153000	They're not going to hear background music when we're doing segments like Jamie's segment.
153000	158000	They're not going to hear all that stuff because the way it's hooked up, only the mics feed into Justin TV.
158000	167000	So if you want to hear everything, you still probably want to watch Justin TV but actually listen through All Games Radio at www.allgames.com
167000	172000	where we tape every Sunday night right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific time.
172000	174000	Let's introduce other people we have in the studio tonight.
174000	176000	We have some very special guests tonight.
176000	181000	I'm going to start with this guy behind me here who has not been to the show before.
181000	185000	But he's someone I've kind of gotten to know a little bit recently and had listened to a few episodes of the show.
185000	187000	And I was like, well, why don't you come be on the show?
187000	189000	So say hello to other Matt.
189000	190000	Matt number two.
190000	192000	Matt two, yes. How are you, Matt two?
192000	193000	I'm good. How are you, Rob?
193000	195000	I'm pretty good. Thanks for asking.
195000	196000	That's good to know.
196000	198000	So you've actually listened to a couple episodes of the show.
198000	200000	I have. I'm not an OLR virgin.
200000	202000	And you weren't freaked out.
202000	203000	No, not too badly.
203000	205000	We first met when somebody brought you over to my New Year's party.
205000	209000	So we kind of like were talking and found out we had some things in common and so on.
209000	211000	But you actually went away and listened to the show and weren't scared off.
211000	213000	You still are talking to me, which is awesome.
213000	216000	The next day I went to iTunes and I downloaded a recent podcast.
216000	219000	So within 24 hours I was already listening.
219000	221000	Very cool. Well, sucker.
221000	224000	Really quickly, what kind of games do you like?
224000	227000	Since you've never been on the show before, we usually like to ask new people.
227000	229000	What kind of video games do you play, if any?
229000	232000	I play a few. Mainly PC gaming for right now.
232000	234000	I do have an Xbox 360.
234000	236000	But I mainly do the PC gaming.
236000	242000	Everything from first person shooter to MMORPGs and everything else in between.
242000	245000	Puzzle games, Prince of Persia, things like that.
245000	249000	Lately it's been WoW and Rock Band 2 have been dominating my time.
249000	250000	Nothing wrong with that.
250000	251000	Nothing wrong with that at all.
251000	253000	WoW was dominating my time for a little while too.
253000	254000	Yes.
254000	255000	Yes, but then I quit.
255000	257000	But then we have Rock Band 2 I play a lot of as well.
257000	258000	I have a question for you.
258000	259000	Okay.
259000	260000	Do you like old PC games?
260000	261000	What do you mean old?
261000	263000	Are you a fan of Loom?
263000	269000	Never played Loom, but I go back as far as my online gaming experience goes back to X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter,
269000	275000	X-Wing Alliance, and organizing online gaming clans, if you will, with IRC chat
275000	279000	and organizing that on the old school MSN Gaming Zone, if anyone remembers that.
279000	280000	Do you ever do MUDs?
280000	281000	Do which?
281000	282000	Do MUDs?
282000	283000	I don't remember MUDs.
283000	284000	Old RPG stuff.
284000	285000	Old, old school.
285000	286000	Yeah.
286000	287000	Back in the day, so.
287000	288000	Yeah.
288000	291000	Descent, Descent was one of the first 3D games.
291000	294000	I remember Descent and having it over 14 floppies.
294000	295000	That's right.
295000	299000	And Doom 2 had 6 floppy 3.5 inch diskettes.
299000	300000	Heck yeah.
300000	302000	I still remember all my cheat codes too.
302000	306000	Alright nerds, we gotta introduce somebody else who's here tonight.
306000	311000	Let's say, this is somebody you always hear a lot about, but he hasn't been on the show too many times,
311000	314000	but just in time for Valentine's Day.
314000	315000	You know what?
315000	318000	I'm gonna let Jamie introduce tonight's special guest.
318000	320000	I think Jamie would do a much better job introducing.
320000	322000	This is my personal parasite.
322000	325000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
325000	330000	Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband, Dan, is joining us tonight on the show.
330000	332000	Dan, how are you?
332000	335000	Uh, hi.
335000	340000	Thanks for that wonderful introduction, wife.
340000	346000	Dan is the king of gaming in our house.
346000	349000	He has more knowledge of classic games than I do.
349000	355000	What I want to know is how much does Dan, your husband, have in common with Dan from Street Fighter?
355000	359000	Next time I want Rob to introduce me, by the way.
359000	361000	I love Street Fighter.
361000	363000	I'm here to talk about Street Fighter 4.
363000	364000	Are you excited about Street Fighter?
364000	367000	If I had more in common with Dan Hibiki, it'd be awesome.
367000	369000	Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?
369000	371000	Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?
371000	378000	I'm not even that big of a fighting game fan, and I have kind of a semi-fanboy boner going for Street Fighter 4.
378000	385000	So fighting game fans must be at that point of no return right about now, because the game's about to be released.
385000	386000	And it looks incredible.
386000	389000	Yeah, I can't stop watching videos.
389000	392000	I prepaid for my $150 fighting stick.
392000	394000	Oh my god.
394000	396000	Yeah, baby.
396000	401000	Well, if you're playing it on Xbox 360, though, you kind of have to have one of those.
401000	409000	Because I'm seriously contemplating getting it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't picture playing Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 controller.
409000	411000	I'm getting it on the PlayStation 3.
411000	413000	Not even just because of the controllers.
413000	415000	That's because I'm not going to play fighting games on live.
415000	418000	Because online gaming is already irritating enough.
418000	421000	Online fighting games are the worst thing to ever happen.
421000	424000	And unless you like them, then hey, go for it.
424000	426000	And honestly, I've got to play something on my PS3.
426000	428000	That poor thing is lonely.
428000	432000	I've got to introduce our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com, and they're always here to talk to us.
432000	438000	By the way, I just want to say, Justin TV, you guys, we don't read the chat room over there as much because it's just too hard to look at two different chat rooms.
438000	442000	So please, please, if you can, join us in the other chat, chat.orangelandtrader.com.
442000	446000	The Rob D is in there, and he's a big fighting game fan as well.
446000	448000	He says, I have the collector's edition preordered.
448000	450000	I'm going crazy.
450000	452000	I'm watching the World Warrior on loop.
452000	454000	I'm watching the Street Fighter cartoon.
454000	457000	I'm going to watch the anime movie the night before.
457000	464000	Try working in a game store where we've had nothing but Street Fighter on all the demos for like a month.
464000	466000	What kind of game store work do you do, if you don't mind me asking?
466000	470000	You don't have to say what company or whatever. I don't know what you can say or can't say, but what kind of game store stuff do you do?
470000	472000	I manage a game crazy.
472000	477000	Anyone who's listened to this store, this show forever knows I used to manage a GameStop.
477000	486000	Now, it's not that there's anything wrong with GameStop, other than the fact that they're corrupt and evil and hate you.
486000	490000	But I jumped to the other side.
490000	495000	So it's not that it's any different. It's just smaller and hates you less.
495000	499000	And I do want to point out now, tonight, we do have the whiteboard in studio.
499000	504000	So we can now start, finally, our list of things that suck about GameStop.
504000	506000	And I'm going to have Dan starting off the list tonight.
506000	513000	They hate you, so I'll be writing that on the whiteboard here while we get into our gaming week.
513000	517000	So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
517000	523000	Well, my past two weeks of gaming have been fairly diverse.
523000	532000	I actually finally got past the stupid dialogue portion of Ragnarok DS and actually got to kill four porings.
532000	535000	Ooh. Four.
535000	537000	Bling, bling, bling.
537000	539000	It's pretty fun so far. That's really cute.
539000	543000	Dude, how do you get to prontera? Because that was the only word I could read.
543000	547000	Because I know some Japanese. I can't read that much Kanji.
547000	548000	So, oh well.
548000	556000	And then, also, finally got through the damn forest on Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.
556000	560000	Because it was exactly what I said I had to do.
560000	564000	One more level and I could do it.
564000	570000	And then I played, we played R-Type Dimensions last night.
570000	573000	And I have to say that it's really, really, really freaking sweet.
573000	577000	Especially having unlimited content, unlimited ships.
577000	580000	Because R-Type is like freaking hard.
580000	581000	It's R-Type.
581000	585000	And this is actually harder than I remember R-Type being.
585000	590000	So, and I wasn't really all that great at R-Type to begin with.
590000	594000	But Dan and I played co-op last night and it was really fun.
594000	596000	No, it wasn't last night. It was the night before.
596000	598000	Anyway, it was really fun.
598000	602000	And I played, I saw something that depressed me.
602000	606000	I saw the trailer for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
606000	608000	It's Civil War crap.
608000	610000	We hated it the first time, Marvel.
610000	611000	Stop it.
611000	614000	Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
614000	617000	It sucked. It was an awful storyline.
617000	619000	Stop it.
619000	621000	Do you hear me?
621000	624000	I read your Twitters. I'll tell you all.
624000	626000	So anyway.
626000	631000	And then, what else did I play?
631000	636000	Oh yeah, I did actually play some Ragnarok Online for like, you know, an hour.
636000	637000	And that was it.
637000	643000	And I'm also, I also had a minor fan-gasm over Star Trek Online's character trailer.
643000	644000	That looked hot.
644000	645000	Uh-huh.
645000	650000	But I'm making our, when it comes out I'm making the official alien race of OLR.
650000	652000	The OLR-ians.
652000	653000	Nice.
653000	654000	Seriously.
654000	655000	Are they gonna be orange people?
655000	658000	No, probably not. Orange is a good color.
658000	660000	Copper.
660000	661000	Copper.
661000	665000	I just, I insist I don't wear a red shirt.
665000	667000	It depends though. No, no, no, no.
667000	671000	If you are, original Star Trek red shirt is the kiss of death.
671000	676000	If you, in Next Generation, yellow is the kiss of death.
676000	681000	If you're Voyager, prepare to suck.
681000	682000	Hey now.
682000	683000	And if you're DS-
683000	685000	I like Janeway. I'm the one.
685000	692000	And if you're DS9, it's the most awesome of them all and Enterprise doesn't exist.
692000	696000	Because really, it's Quantum Leap the future.
696000	697000	Okay.
697000	700000	Um, Trek nerds. We gotta get back to video games.
700000	703000	Oh, um, um, um, um.
703000	707000	Um, and, uh, I, uh, I did play something else.
707000	711000	Oh yeah, I'm also, I think I found an MMO to play though in the meantime that's free to play.
711000	713000	Um, it's Perfect World.
713000	715000	My friend Heather plays it.
715000	719000	And I've seen it, it's pretty cool, so I was gonna give it a try since it's free in that World of Warcraft.
719000	722000	I've never heard of Perfect World. Give us a brief description of what this is.
722000	724000	Um, it's not World of Warcraft.
724000	725000	Oh, well then I'm sold, hey!
725000	730000	It's the same type of game though, but it has some pretty gorgeous environments and it's pretty cool.
730000	733000	And you can actually ride a tiger.
733000	735000	You can ride a white tiger.
735000	737000	I want a white tiger.
737000	740000	Can you get the eye of the tiger?
740000	743000	I've also decided something else completely unrelated to gaming.
743000	744000	I want a pet goat.
744000	745000	She doesn't even acknowledge it.
745000	747000	No, I'm not.
747000	750000	I also decided that I want a pet goat while I was out of town.
750000	753000	You can have my sisters if you want.
753000	754000	Really?
754000	755000	No, she can't.
755000	756000	She has four.
756000	759000	Do they have the cool rectangular pupils?
759000	760000	I don't care.
760000	763000	Wait, in real life IRL she wants a goat?
763000	764000	Yes!
764000	765000	No, my sister-
765000	766000	Where the hell are you gonna put a goat?
766000	767000	In the backyard!
767000	768000	Exac-
768000	772000	Hey, well, you know, my sister is looking for a place to store her four goats, so-
772000	775000	I want one goat so I can walk it on a leash.
775000	778000	Well, they suck.
778000	780000	What are you gonna do with a goat?
780000	781000	Keep it as a pet!
781000	782000	I don't know, you can't-
782000	783000	What, are you gonna take it out and walk it around the block?
783000	786000	Yes!
786000	787000	My sister collects animals, apparently.
787000	789000	Is he gonna ride it to work?
789000	792000	No, goats are too little to ride.
792000	793000	They suck.
793000	794000	There is nothing cool about goats.
794000	796000	They just eat shit and then shit.
796000	800000	Yeah, they'll eat anything, so I'll just feed it, you know, Jaguar games.
800000	802000	That's all they do.
802000	805000	They just process grass into shit.
805000	807000	That is it.
807000	808000	But they're cute.
808000	809000	They are not cute at all.
809000	811000	They are goats.
811000	812000	Dad's goats are cute.
812000	815000	Okay, we're not talking about Harvest Moon here.
815000	816000	And they're meat goats.
816000	817000	Video games!
817000	818000	Okay, your gaming week.
818000	820000	I was gonna say they're meat goats.
820000	823000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
823000	824000	Goat free, I hope.
824000	827000	Yes, it was goat free, thank God.
827000	833000	No, this week I didn't play hardly anything other than Grand Theft Auto IV.
833000	838000	And I've been prepping my experience of Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC,
838000	841000	putting the right mods in place so that I can go in.
841000	844000	And hopefully film something funny.
844000	845000	Just a little hint.
845000	853000	I found a skin to reskin Nico to look like Adolf Hitler.
853000	855000	Oh, it's gonna be fun.
855000	859000	And let's see what else.
859000	864000	Some other mods that flood stuff and, you know, crazy weapons.
864000	868000	So it's gonna be the wacky world of Adolf Hitler.
868000	870000	Or maybe another Hitler, you know.
870000	871000	Hitler on Ice.
871000	874000	Hitler in the Matrix or something, I don't know.
874000	875000	Anyways.
875000	877000	Can I say some chat comments real quick?
877000	878000	Sure.
878000	879000	Because now they're on a goat kick.
879000	884000	Bob Coffee Away, I think, who forgot to change their name to Bob Coffee because they're obviously
884000	885000	there.
885000	887000	Bob Coffee says, zombie goats would be the best thing ever.
887000	889000	That might be like a video game involving zombie goats.
889000	892000	Well, they did have Black Sheep, which was zombie sheep.
892000	893000	That was an awful movie.
893000	897000	I saw that, you know, they had the trailer for that at the beginning of, what is it,
897000	898000	Death Proof?
898000	900000	And it was actually a real movie?
900000	904000	ActDeafedInChat says, sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell.
904000	911000	I just posted a picture of the goats in chat because I love them.
911000	912000	Chat.orangelandstrategy.com.
912000	914000	Oh, haha, Brad.
914000	919000	My sister seriously has her goat on her Facebook as one of her pictures.
919000	920000	I am not kidding.
920000	922000	She has, well, she had four of them.
922000	926000	I think she has three now because one of them got attacked by dogs and died.
926000	928000	But, she has three goats.
928000	929000	Wait!
929000	932000	Wait, I gotta tell you, this just proves goats suck.
932000	936000	If like a bunch of dogs can take out a goat, they're fat.
936000	938000	It was a pack of dogs.
938000	940000	It was a pack of pit bulls.
940000	941000	Oh my god.
941000	943000	That's a pack of angry dogs.
943000	948000	The coolest thing about these goats is that they have rectangular pupils.
948000	949000	And I am obsessed with that.
949000	951000	Is there a dogs who hate goats society?
951000	952000	What is this?
952000	953000	This is like-
953000	954000	No.
954000	956000	This is her boyfriend's dogs actually.
956000	958000	This is like Animal Farm for reals.
958000	961000	They don't take care of them and they start going feral.
961000	963000	So that's why they attack the goats.
963000	965000	Anyways, because they're hungry.
965000	969000	So, she also has a bunch of birds and hamsters and shit.
969000	971000	So yeah, she's-
971000	973000	She still needs to be a veterinarian though, right?
973000	974000	So we kinda let her get away with it.
974000	976000	Yeah, but she shouldn't have goats.
976000	977000	She's in an apartment.
977000	980000	She has to store them like in Rio Linda.
980000	989000	Which, you know, for Rio Linda, they fit right in.
989000	993000	But anyways, yes, they do have names.
993000	994000	I don't remember what the names are.
994000	999000	Rio Linda is from Sacramento is at Morris to Mobile, Alabama.
999000	1001000	Oh yeah, that's gonna help a lot.
1001000	1004000	Okay, it's the boonies of California.
1004000	1007000	Anyways, so yeah, that's my game week.
1007000	1008000	It was just Grand Theft Auto.
1008000	1013000	I meant to download Killzone 2 because I don't have it pre-ordered at GameStop.
1013000	1016000	Oh, how will I ever get the demo that seems to be region-free?
1016000	1019000	Maybe I'll create another free account in the UK!
1019000	1023000	Oh no! I've bypassed her! Security!
1023000	1025000	So yeah.
1025000	1028000	Wow. Alright, my gaming week.
1028000	1030000	I don't have a whole lot to share.
1030000	1035000	After last week's show, you might remember Rice Princess was going crazy over the fact that I had the Resident Evil 5 demo.
1035000	1038000	So we actually went in and played the Resident Evil 5 demo and it was pretty cool.
1038000	1040000	Yes, I'll give my impressions on that.
1040000	1043000	I was just like, heh, that's okay.
1043000	1044000	Was that your impressions?
1044000	1046000	Yeah, it was just like, eh.
1046000	1047000	That's kind of how I felt about it.
1047000	1048000	It was alright.
1048000	1051000	Resident Evil is not a series I've ever gotten into.
1051000	1053000	I mean, I love zombies and stuff.
1053000	1057000	There's another zombie series, of course, that I really got into that we'll be talking about later.
1057000	1058000	I have to get this off my chest, I'm sorry.
1058000	1060000	I need to stop talking about this because I have to get this off my chest.
1060000	1062000	I've been waiting all night to say this.
1062000	1068000	I played the absolute worst Xbox Live arcade game in my entire freaking life this week.
1068000	1069000	Worse than Yaris?
1069000	1071000	Worse than Yaris.
1071000	1073000	And they're actually charging money for this one, okay?
1073000	1078000	Apparently this is based off a game show or something, but I've never seen it before.
1078000	1082000	And it is the worst fucking idea for a game I've ever seen in my life.
1082000	1084000	It's called Merv Griffin's Crosswords.
1084000	1089000	Oh my god, this game was awful.
1089000	1091000	Wasn't that actually a TV show?
1091000	1093000	It is a TV show.
1093000	1098000	I hope it got cancelled like five times because the setup of the show was stupid.
1098000	1101000	The AI in the game was stupid.
1101000	1104000	If they got an answer wrong, they would misspell words.
1104000	1106000	I didn't even understand how the game worked.
1106000	1109000	And the clues were terrible.
1109000	1111000	Like, oh my god, this game was awful.
1111000	1117000	I felt myself slowly dying being attacked by a pack of wild dogs or something while playing this game.
1117000	1119000	It was so, so terrible.
1119000	1122000	And I can't believe they're even trying to charge $10 for it.
1122000	1125000	Oh god, it was a horrible game.
1125000	1128000	Really, Merv Griffin's Crosswords.
1128000	1134000	I think I would have saw Merv Griffin's Crosswords and been like, nope, sorry.
1134000	1137000	Why don't they bring us a good game like old school Press Your Luck?
1137000	1139000	I know, for real, right? Bring us some good game shows.
1139000	1141000	I know, right?
1141000	1147000	Frisbee in Chat says, this game, S-U-C blank S.
1147000	1149000	Exactly how I feel.
1149000	1153000	I wouldn't even be upset if they brought back Bumper Stumpers.
1153000	1157000	Bumper Stumpers was kind of like, how can you have Bumper Stumpers go on and on and on forever?
1157000	1159000	It was great.
1159000	1160000	Alright, forget it. Anyway.
1160000	1164000	How do you man, did they bring a game of Double Dare?
1164000	1168000	VX JasonXV in Chat says, the game show itself is interesting.
1168000	1170000	Games based off of game shows tend to suck though.
1170000	1175000	Look, I would rather play the are you smarter than a fifth grader game all day long
1175000	1179000	than have to play five minutes of Merv Griffin's Crosswords ever again.
1179000	1181000	With Zombie Jeff Foxworthy?
1181000	1187000	Actually, all things considered, the are you smarter than a fifth grader game wasn't bad.
1187000	1191000	I mean, for what it is, you know what it is, it's an adaptation of the TV show.
1191000	1194000	If you don't like the TV show, then whatever, you're probably not going to like the game.
1194000	1197000	For what it is, that live game is not bad.
1197000	1201000	But this game was just not fun at all. At all.
1201000	1203000	Maybe because you weren't a fan of the TV show?
1203000	1207000	I never watched the TV show. I loved the Scrabble show back in the day.
1207000	1211000	I like word game shows. The Scrabble show is awesome.
1211000	1213000	Lingo. I love Lingo.
1213000	1216000	These are two games I would rather see on Xbox Live.
1216000	1220000	You should have a game that you're an audience member at one of these shows
1220000	1223000	and you can yell at the contestants and get them to do stuff.
1223000	1225000	But it may or may not affect the answers.
1225000	1229000	This whole one versus a hundred thing that's coming to Xbox Live or whatever that is.
1229000	1232000	What are they calling that? The whole shows on live on live or whatever it is?
1232000	1234000	It's like they're not community games.
1234000	1235000	Hopefully it's like that.
1235000	1237000	Yeah, I don't remember what it's called.
1237000	1239000	Hopefully it's not. It'd just be like Xbox Live.
1239000	1244000	But in true Xbox Live form, when the host gets up there, you just have to start yelling,
1244000	1246000	Fag, fag, fag, fuck, fuck, nah.
1246000	1248000	Never mind. I'm not going to...
1248000	1250000	You know what else they say on Xbox Live.
1250000	1255000	Let's see. What else did I play this week as far as video games go?
1255000	1257000	I just was so obsessed with hating that game.
1257000	1260000	I did play the new R-Type game. That was kind of fun.
1260000	1265000	I got to say, that whole switching between 2D and 3D with a button was totally pointless,
1265000	1267000	but it was kind of cool.
1267000	1271000	It's like, I'm turning the 3D on. Oh, I'm turning the 3D off.
1271000	1273000	I'm turning the 3D on. I'm turning it off.
1273000	1276000	And Deep Man in Chat says, did you mention Left 4 Dead?
1276000	1278000	I did check out Left 4 Dead finally.
1278000	1281000	One of our listeners was very, very kind and gave...
1281000	1283000	I guess they bought a four-pack together, but only used three of the codes.
1283000	1286000	So they gave me a code. I was very, very thankful.
1286000	1289000	And I did check out the game for a little bit, but not enough to give impressions yet.
1289000	1291000	I haven't played enough at all.
1291000	1296000	I got raped in like five minutes. That's how horrible I am at first-person shooters, okay?
1296000	1300000	I was going down the stairs, and then some big fat guy comes down the stairs and rapes us all
1300000	1301000	because I don't know what I'm doing.
1301000	1304000	So I need to figure out what the hell to do in this game.
1304000	1305000	That's just Left 4 Dead.
1305000	1306000	I guess so.
1306000	1311000	But it's like, oh, the dude just threw up on your party member. You're fucked now.
1311000	1315000	I was like, I don't know what I'm doing. I haven't even played this for five minutes.
1315000	1319000	Anyhow, yeah, that's going to do it for my gaming week.
1319000	1324000	Matt, number two, did you play anything interesting this week you'd like to share with our listeners?
1324000	1326000	I'm just a big square, and I play a little bit of WoW.
1326000	1330000	I'm on that ever-long quest to hit 80 because I'm a noob.
1330000	1332000	But you have like 20 characters.
1332000	1338000	I do not have 20 characters. I have one of every class on Narzul, which is my main server.
1338000	1343000	And it's funny because we do have TrekkieNerds on the show tonight, and I think every time.
1343000	1348000	Most of my characters are named after what I have affectionately called obscure Star Trek characters.
1348000	1354000	So, for example, Kes, Seska, Neelix, Gum2, Darmok.
1354000	1357000	And if you're a Trekkie, you recognize hopefully a handful of those.
1357000	1361000	I recognize two of them as Voyager names.
1361000	1362000	That's right.
1362000	1364000	Darmok and Neelix was really obscure.
1364000	1366000	He was on for like six seasons.
1366000	1368000	But he cooked and he didn't.
1368000	1370000	He was a main character. He was in the opening credits.
1370000	1372000	He was on Voyager!
1372000	1376000	He was a morale officer that became a security guy under Tuvok.
1376000	1380000	So, obscure because you never really think of him. You think of Janeway.
1380000	1382000	Trekkie's 3.
1382000	1384000	Yeah, Trekkie's 3, exactly.
1384000	1386000	What's that?
1386000	1388000	I have to ask, do you like Warp 11?
1388000	1389000	No.
1389000	1390000	Sadness.
1390000	1392000	I'm sorry.
1392000	1398000	My main mage is Malak, but I had to rename him to Valerian since someone took the name when I had the transfer service.
1398000	1405000	So, hopefully one day Valerian will be 80 and then I will have to work on my other, as Rob calls him, 20 characters.
1405000	1413000	Bobcoffee and Chat says, I recognize all of those. I fail at life. LOL.
1413000	1416000	We both fail at life. LOL squared.
1416000	1418000	That was pretty much my gaming week.
1418000	1423000	My Xbox 360 has unfortunately remained dormant these past few weeks because WoW has taken over my life.
1423000	1424000	Nice.
1424000	1429000	Alright, speaking of Chat, I think they're previewing our new website in the chat room right now.
1429000	1432000	I was talking about it on Bobby's show, but I don't think I mentioned it here yet.
1432000	1436000	We are going to be launching a new website soon and I think Deep Man was previewing it.
1436000	1439000	And check it out in chat. It's pretty awesome.
1439000	1443000	Dan, how was your gaming week? What kind of stuff have you been playing?
1443000	1444000	It was awesome.
1444000	1449000	I pulled down HD Remix, the Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix.
1449000	1454000	And at first I played the demo and I was like, ah, super janky, no thanks.
1454000	1457000	But as Street Fighter Mania gripped me, it was like, okay, I'll download it.
1457000	1462000	And it's actually not too bad. It's a little bit easier than Super Turbo is normally, so that's pretty awesome.
1462000	1466000	See, Rob, these are the people that encourage this kind of behavior, re-releasing games.
1466000	1467000	I know.
1467000	1474000	Oh, I'm terrible because I also downloaded R-Type Dimensions, which was, it kicked ass, you know.
1474000	1481000	And I've got the remake of Bionic Commando. I'm a remake whore. Seriously, if it's a good remake, if it's a game that needs to be remade...
1481000	1482000	Some of them are really good.
1482000	1491000	Because of technology, I mean, I fully say remake it, but you've got to be real faithful and real respectful of the original material.
1491000	1495000	See, I don't have a problem with the Bionic Commando one because that changed enough of it.
1495000	1499000	They've added a whole bunch of stuff in it. It's not just like, okay, we made the sprites prettier.
1499000	1500000	Frogger.
1500000	1501000	Same game, you know.
1501000	1503000	And Frogger, yeah, perfect example.
1503000	1510000	R-Type, I'm not really sure if they changed anything to it, but, you know, Street Fighter, I mean, they just made the sprites prettier.
1510000	1515000	Well, that was basically what they did with R-Type. I mean, it's R-Type 1, R-Type 2. It's got the 3D graphics.
1515000	1519000	They added a two-player simultaneous mode, which was actually kind of interesting, but...
1519000	1520000	Cool.
1520000	1526000	If you're an R-Type god and you could play through the whole game with no problem, yeah, it's still just R-Type.
1526000	1528000	You are an R-Type god, though, from what I remember Jamie saying.
1528000	1534000	Yeah, I could totally dust, like, the first three levels of R-Type 1, then you get to level 4 when the game gets hard.
1534000	1543000	And, I mean, I don't care who you are, R-Type gets real, real hard. I could beat it on the consoles, but this R-Type Dimension is a hard version of R-Type.
1543000	1556000	I don't know if your hitbox in that game is bigger or what, but, you know, there's a lot of shooters and stuff that deserve remakes, and so I do encourage that, you know, as long as it's respectful to the original game and it's a game that needs it, you know.
1556000	1563000	Tigerclaw in chat makes a good case. He says, Bionic Commando remake was awesome. You get the Hitler head explosion in full 3D.
1563000	1564000	True that.
1564000	1566000	That is true. Very true.
1566000	1572000	Alright, we're going to go ahead and get into some housekeeping tonight real quick, and then we'll finally get into some gaming news.
1572000	1573000	Hold on, hold on.
1573000	1574000	Oh, what?
1574000	1575000	I have a few more things I want to add.
1575000	1576000	No.
1576000	1581000	Yes. Ah. What the hell, okay? I don't think we're talking about this tonight, so I'm going to mention it anyways.
1581000	1590000	The Warriors on Xbox Live Arcade. They're making a new version of the Warriors game that's like, it's now like Final Fight, the Warriors.
1590000	1592000	Speaking of didn't need to be remade.
1592000	1593000	And probably won't have Guy in it.
1593000	1604000	It's just, it's, God, it's horrible. Why would they do that? The Warriors game on Xbox is so awesome. Just make that backwards compatible, and then we're done.
1604000	1609000	I mean, I don't know. And I also wanted to say I saw Coraline in 3D and that was awesome.
1609000	1610000	I want to see that.
1610000	1616000	I haven't seen a 3D movie, at least with the new like real 3D or whatever stuff, and it was really sweet.
1616000	1624000	Plus the polarized glasses. I think there's a way you can get your PC monitors to do 3D with the polarized stuff, so I'm going to play with that.
1624000	1630000	Do you think that type of, you know, just totally random off the cusp question, do you think that type of technology might be coming to gaming someday?
1630000	1633000	Oh yeah, definitely. I think actually it's already coming to gaming.
1633000	1639000	They're going to show that off at E3 this year with Avatar by Ubisoft. It's going to be in 3D as well.
1639000	1647000	And I wouldn't be surprised if it's polarized because that would make sense to me because it doesn't look that bad when you're not looking at it without the glasses.
1647000	1658000	Because I was really surprised before. I'm just used to kind of like either the really weird blurry glasses or the red and blue stuff.
1658000	1661000	So, you know, old school 3D stuff.
1661000	1666000	But, I mean, the polarized glasses, it was weird because I put them on and I thought, oh, this is going to hurt my eyes and stuff.
1666000	1671000	And I was like, wow, it's just looking like through normal glasses. But then, you know, the effect on the screen is really awesome.
1671000	1681000	Well, a question for you. Do you ever, I think it's on the Wiimote hack website. There was the guy who did sort of the reverse by using the infrared sensors.
1681000	1689000	Yeah, the, I forget what they call it. Yeah, I haven't done that. Just, I don't know. I can't get my Bluetooth stuff to work right.
1689000	1697000	If you can see the full 3D effect, even just watching a video of it, they should do something that would utilize that type of technology.
1697000	1701000	Well, they were supposed to in boom blocks, if you remember, the developers want to do that.
1701000	1707000	But they somehow, someone said no and they had to take it out.
1707000	1712000	It's going to be a little Easter egg in there where you could do it that way. I forget what they called it.
1712000	1724000	But yeah, I think, I know like TrackMania, I think, does some sort of 3D thing. I don't know if it's with the red, blue glasses or if it's the polarized glasses, but that'd be fun.
1724000	1729000	Because TrackMania is a sweet game. But that's it. Sorry.
1729000	1736000	No, that's all right. That's all right. Let's talk about really quickly housekeeping. I pretty much said all I wanted to say about the new website.
1736000	1740000	Hopefully that will go live for everybody, not just during the show, but everybody will get to see that.
1740000	1743000	Maybe in the next week or two. It's going to be awesome.
1743000	1747000	Regular content, again, I'm so excited. We can actually do reviews and all that fun stuff. It'll be great.
1747000	1756000	Otherwise, just make sure to keep following us on MySpace and Facebook, at the O.L. Army on Facebook, and LiveJournal as well at Orange Lounge.
1756000	1757000	What, Loki?
1757000	1767000	I was just thinking, because it is sort of housekeeping, the E3 news, you know, the special guests that we're going to have doing special...
1767000	1771000	Oh yeah. I'm very excited about E3. That's all I have to say. Very excited about E3.
1771000	1773000	Yes, this year at E3 because...
1773000	1775000	I hope I can get in.
1775000	1783000	I mean, I know I'll be able to get in. Getting my special guests in is going to be difficult, but we'll see.
1783000	1794000	Anyways, possibly this year we will have Nellie coming in to do her Woman That Hates Gaming review of E3.
1794000	1804000	Because we're going to go there for a couple days. We're actually going to a trip for Disneyland as well, because E3 happens to fall on her birthday.
1804000	1813000	So she said, you know, I'm going to be very loving and I'll go with you. You can go to E3.
1813000	1822000	And as long as we go to Disneyland and stuff, I'm fine with that. I can go into E3 maybe a day or two or something like that.
1822000	1826000	I'm very excited to get the Wife That Hates Gaming interview. It's going to be amazing.
1826000	1828000	Alright, so we'll see. We'll see.
1828000	1833000	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news. We're like a half hour into the show and haven't gotten to gaming news yet. So, Loki, please take it away.
1833000	1846000	Alright. Well, speaking of E3, the exhibitor list has been revealed and some people that had dropped out before are back, including Activision Blizzard.
1846000	1853000	They are back after dropping out of the last E3. But, I mean, who can blame them? The last E3 was kind of ehhh. I don't know.
1853000	1865000	But, it's interesting though. Even though Activision Blizzard may be there, the Blizzard portion of Activision will not be there.
1865000	1877000	But, I mean, I guess they did have a few things they could have shown off like Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2. But, I don't know. I mean, I don't really know when all that's supposed to come out.
1877000	1881000	So, they don't really necessarily need to show that, I guess.
1881000	1884000	What does Activision have that you want to see without Blizzard?
1884000	1885000	Without Blizzard?
1885000	1891000	Blizzard has everything. They've got Starcraft. They've got Diablo. They've got whatever's next for Warcraft.
1891000	1896000	Activision's like, well, we've got Guitar Hero.
1896000	1897000	Call of Duty.
1897000	1898000	I mean, granted, they'll have...
1898000	1900000	Well, Modern Warfare 2, sure, maybe.
1900000	1906000	I'll give you a list of what I want to see from them. DJ Hero. The new Tony Hawk game, which is supposed to be...
1906000	1910000	I mean, granted, I want to see it. I don't want to buy it or play it.
1910000	1911000	Killing a franchise.
1911000	1919000	It's the new Tony Hawk game where they're going to have an actual skateboard that you use for the game. So, that'll be interesting.
1919000	1921000	They're trying to sell us for $200.
1921000	1928000	Exactly. Maybe you see what they're going to do to innovate with Guitar Hero.
1928000	1938000	And then maybe Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and possibly the new Transformers game just to see if it's really sucky or not.
1938000	1941000	Well, hey, I know the first game blew.
1941000	1943000	Did you watch the trailer that's up on Kotaku for it?
1943000	1946000	Yes, and it doesn't look any better than the first game.
1946000	1948000	But it's a different developer.
1948000	1951000	It doesn't matter. It's a movie game. It's going to suck.
1951000	1954000	It'll be bad in a different way, and not all movie games suck.
1954000	1957000	Oh, wonderful. Thank you.
1957000	1961000	Okay, Wanted looks awesome, and that's going to be a movie game, of course.
1961000	1967000	Yeah, but it's not going to be awesome. You're watching the trailer and you're like, ooh, that looks like it might be good.
1967000	1973000	Okay, yeah, Transformers, the new game trailer, there was nothing that said, hmm, I'm going to buy this. It just kind of...
1973000	1974000	I mean, look at it.
1974000	1979000	If you even spend money to rent that game, you're high.
1979000	1983000	It's for seven-year-old boys who love the movie and have to keep on living it.
1983000	1985000	It's not for gamers.
1985000	1987000	But I want to keep on living the movie!
1987000	1990000	Fine! Pirate it like the rest of us!
1990000	1993000	Okay!
1993000	1996000	But seriously, Activision has got nothing without Blizzard.
1996000	1998000	In fact, they may as well just call the whole company Blizzard.
1998000	2002000	Well, they also have Alpha, was it Prototype, which looks really awesome.
2002000	2004000	That's Sierra, but yeah.
2004000	2006000	They've got Modern Warfare 2. That's it.
2006000	2008000	I mean, and that should be Mankind.
2008000	2009000	I'm excited about it.
2009000	2011000	The hitball series is just waiting to make a comeback.
2011000	2012000	No, it's not!
2012000	2013000	They try and stay dead.
2013000	2015000	They try that every generation.
2015000	2016000	They keep bringing it back and it sucks.
2016000	2018000	Didn't they already make one for the Wii?
2018000	2019000	Yes, and it sucks.
2019000	2023000	Okay, it started off as a port of the GameCube game and they fucked that up.
2023000	2027000	And so they made it into this new game where they renamed it and it still sucked.
2027000	2033000	Okay, speaking of porting GameCube games, who's not bitter that Pikmin is just the GameCube version with Wii controls?
2033000	2036000	That's all they're doing, is putting out all these GameCube games with Wii controls.
2036000	2037000	Oh, no, no!
2037000	2040000	Well, don't get me wrong, I'm kind of down with that whenever I'm a remake whore, but come on!
2040000	2042000	No, they promised us a new Pikmin.
2042000	2043000	They are doing a new Pikmin.
2043000	2049000	They're doing this, they're doing Pikmin and Pikmin 2, and then they're actually going to announce a new Pikmin at E3.
2049000	2052000	Do a game I want to play again, like F-Zero.
2052000	2053000	Oh, yeah.
2053000	2056000	Well, F-Zero on the Wii would be awesome.
2056000	2058000	Even if it's just GX, because that game was brutal.
2058000	2061000	That better be the secret in Reggie's pants at E3.
2061000	2064000	That's what they should be doing as one of the Wii.
2064000	2066000	New play control games.
2066000	2069000	Zip, ew, Falcon Punch!
2072000	2082000	No, seriously, they should do a new play control version of F-Zero GX, because that'd be perfect, but instead of this Mario Power Tennis, really, was that such a great game that it requires...
2082000	2086000	No, Mario Power Tennis was pretty pimp.
2086000	2089000	And come on, like Strikers, Strikers is awesome.
2089000	2093000	Mario's aggressive death soccer is like the best game to ever happen.
2093000	2097000	I still, still can't, you know, believe that that game is that good.
2097000	2100000	I hate soccer, but I love that game.
2100000	2112000	Sorry, I can't get that mental image now of Reggie Fils-Aime coming out at E3 and Falcon Punching us with his cock.
2112000	2121000	I issue a challenge now to our listeners, especially the ones who were kind enough to do the kudaragi crayon eating picture.
2121000	2123000	No, no, don't make a picture.
2123000	2125000	We now want the Falcon Punch picture.
2125000	2126000	No, no.
2126000	2130000	I will, I will send someone a shiny silver dollar.
2130000	2133000	Keep it clean. Alright.
2133000	2135000	That I ride on in Sharpie.
2135000	2141000	Let's move on to something depressing to try and sedate the show a little bit here.
2141000	2145000	Sadly, THQ has laid off about 100 people on their staff.
2145000	2151000	And, you know, sad trombone, but, you know, it was the mobile gaming division.
2151000	2158000	And I don't mean to sound, you know, crass. I feel sorry for those people. You know, it sucks to lose jobs and stuff, and the economy stinks and everything.
2158000	2160000	But, you know.
2160000	2163000	Does THQ make anything besides SmackDown?
2163000	2169000	Yeah, they make a bunch of SpongeBob, you know, and Nintendo licensed games, and Saints Row 2, which I love.
2169000	2172000	Oh yeah, they did make Saints Row 2. That game was not so bad.
2172000	2177000	Anyhow, well, here's the thing. They are actually going to be restructuring the wireless subsidiary.
2177000	2184000	Apparently, though, they actually closed completely the San Diego Mobile Studio, as well, and some offices in the UK and Germany.
2184000	2187000	They are still going to be cranking out some wireless games, though, out of Finland.
2187000	2195000	They are Uni Versomo Studios, and I guess this means, I don't know, more Worms Mobile, things of that sort.
2195000	2199000	They did a mobile version of Saints Row. I don't think it was any good, though.
2199000	2205000	I don't know. If they did, like, Worms World Party for, like, the iPhone, I'd be down.
2205000	2211000	Yeah, I mean, again, I feel bad. I don't mean to joke about people losing their jobs, but at the same time, you know, mobile games...
2211000	2214000	No, it's cool. If you've got a job, just go for it.
2214000	2218000	There might be good news for mobile things later on in the show we're going to get into.
2218000	2221000	The only good news for mobile gaming is the iPhone, which is awesome.
2221000	2224000	Well, that's exactly what we're going to get into a little later in the show.
2224000	2225000	Oh, well, then I won't spoil it.
2225000	2228000	But for now, we'll get into some more gaming news, won't we, Dar Sakura?
2228000	2231000	Yes, we will. Who likes Netflix?
2231000	2238000	Me! I have watched seasons one and two of 30 Rock on Netflix on demand on the Xbox 360. It's great.
2238000	2252000	See, speaking of Netflix on the Xbox 360, they did a survey that went out to a few members that was asking them if they would pay a little bit extra for premium content, like, from cable channels, like HBO.
2252000	2259000	And it's sort of, I guess, rumored that it's going to be around, you know, ten bucks extra.
2259000	2262000	Don't encourage them.
2262000	2266000	But, um, I don't know. I think some people would be excited by it.
2266000	2267000	Nobody will be excited by it.
2267000	2269000	There are consumer whores.
2269000	2276000	Look, I like the idea of offering some more of this premium content. Like, being able to watch the tutors on demand and all this kind of stuff sounds kind of awesome.
2276000	2285000	Because I like that type of period piece fucking. Because that's what the tutors is. I don't know if you've ever watched it, but it's period piece fucking, basically.
2285000	2295000	But here's the thing is that, then if they set the bar and they say, oh, we're going to charge this premium content for all this extra stuff on Xbox 360, then everybody's going to want to be premium content.
2295000	2306000	I'm going to have nothing left to watch but independent documentaries about strippers that went to stripping because of Hurricane Katrina, which, yes, is an actual documentary I once watched on Netflix 360.
2306000	2307000	That's all that's going to be left is Hurricane.
2307000	2308000	Awesome.
2308000	2319000	Premium content, good. Paying more, bad. It's already $9 a month for the super basic level with the unlimited streaming, which is great through the Xbox. I love it.
2319000	2324000	It's awesome. It's got me watching more TV than ever, which is really what society needed.
2324000	2329000	But at the same time, it's like, oh, man, don't give them any reason to charge us more.
2329000	2334000	It's giving us Doctor Who. We've got up to season four now, right?
2334000	2335000	No.
2335000	2336000	No?
2336000	2341000	We have season four, but we're not paying extra for it. It just came with the Netflix.
2341000	2343000	Well, I'd be curious if you signed up for premium membership.
2343000	2350000	It takes away subscribership from HBO, Cinemax, all that stuff from cable subscribers because now they can just download for a whole lot cheaper.
2350000	2359000	The main shows like Big Love, Tutors, other Sopranos from back in the day, those types of shows I'm at, I would be curious to take away subscribership.
2359000	2364000	That's a good question, but I wonder if they would care because they're still getting money from you watching their shows.
2364000	2366000	So maybe they don't care. They still get their money one way or another.
2366000	2369000	That's true, or the cable companies are maybe losing revenue.
2369000	2370000	Well, to hell with them.
2370000	2377000	I'm sure that Netflix is actually paying a certain percentage to the premium channels for content.
2377000	2382000	I mean, that would make sense, or else HBO would be like, bitch, please.
2382000	2393000	Well, they pay a licensing fee for the movies that they use, but I mean, it's not like they're going to show The Sopranos every night after it comes on like they do CSI.
2393000	2399000	Xlink in chatroom says, gives a very honest response. This is why I torrent. It's a very honest response.
2399000	2401000	It's whether the legality is questionable or whatever.
2401000	2402000	Same here.
2402000	2408000	Well, Dan says, why pay for what I conceal? But also, there's something to be said, just like iTunes.
2408000	2411000	Why do people actually use iTunes when you can go out and find the downloaded MP3?
2411000	2414000	Because sometimes it's a pain in the ass to find the actual MP3.
2414000	2415000	Because I have an iPhone.
2415000	2421000	Well, how convenient is it that you can just sit there, tap a button, and you will have the full song for just a buck?
2421000	2422000	And it's legal.
2422000	2426000	And you get the warm fuzzies, legal, supporting the artist, all that stuff.
2426000	2429000	I get the warm fuzzies doing the opposite.
2429000	2430000	Well, you're evil.
2430000	2432000	That's because you're a pre-vert.
2432000	2433000	All right.
2433000	2434000	Okay, that's not true.
2434000	2435000	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
2435000	2440000	Netflix isn't really gaming, but at the same time, that's what people use their 360s for lately. At least I do.
2440000	2443000	One million. One million subscribers.
2443000	2449000	I spend more time on my 360. Seriously, if you look what I've done the past week, on the 360, I played that horrible Crosswords game.
2449000	2450000	I played...
2450000	2451000	Sweet.
2451000	2452000	Netflix.
2452000	2456000	My PlayStation 3 is actually where I've been gaming lately, because I have Prince of Persia on PS3.
2456000	2458000	I've been playing that on Little Big Planet. I've been playing the hell out of.
2458000	2461000	That's been my PS3.
2461000	2462000	I'm actually using my...
2462000	2468000	Which is weird, because I always thought PS3 was supposed to be the system that was going to be my all-in-one entertainment center.
2468000	2470000	But, like, I'm the complete opposite lately.
2470000	2471000	I don't know what the hell's up with that.
2471000	2472000	I don't know.
2472000	2475000	I use my PS3 for streaming stuff. It works pretty well.
2475000	2478000	All right. Who cares? Anyway, it's all right. Let's move on with gaming news.
2478000	2481000	Gauntlet DS is potentially cancelled.
2481000	2489000	This is coming from various retail sites that have been telling their customers it had a pre-order that's been cancelled.
2489000	2495000	That it's been removed off of GameStop and some other retail websites.
2495000	2504000	I know from a distributor standpoint, I think it was locked and basically put out of print.
2504000	2511000	Which either means that it's got a to-be-announced release date, or actually it's cancelled.
2511000	2514000	So, it's pretty much cancelled.
2514000	2516000	Could it possibly be in limo?
2516000	2518000	Like, might the game be changing hands or something?
2518000	2521000	It could be. It happens a lot. In fact...
2521000	2524000	With Midway going through all the problems it's been having too, you know.
2524000	2526000	Thank you for reminding me too.
2526000	2531000	That was something I got to touch on at a special time later on.
2531000	2533000	There was something going through limbo.
2533000	2534000	Okay.
2534000	2540000	Anyways, it's very possible something like this. It looked okay.
2540000	2545000	I don't remember being that impressed by it, because I did play it at PAX, but it was all right.
2545000	2548000	Anything four player on the DS would be really cool.
2548000	2552000	Four player with voiceover IP during the game.
2552000	2555000	Anything that you're waiting for from Midway, don't hold your breath.
2555000	2558000	It pains me to say it, because I love Midway.
2558000	2559000	Me too.
2559000	2565000	I love Mortal Kombat and a lot of their IPs, but that company is boned.
2565000	2567000	It is too bad.
2567000	2569000	They owe twice what their company is worth.
2569000	2580000	The only solace that you'll get is the fact that probably the big studios that they own in the franchises will be snapped up by bigger, probably more stable companies.
2580000	2589000	They'll all belong to EA or Act of Blizzard before it's all over, but Midway is going down the tubes.
2589000	2594000	You've got to wonder how much Midway lost on that stranglehold or whatever that game was.
2594000	2598000	They brought in that big, huge name director and they spent all this money marketing it.
2598000	2601000	I think the game made a ploop when it landed.
2601000	2606000	It's not just stranglehold. They've just had flop after flop after flop.
2606000	2611000	They have all these great franchises and they would try to bring them back.
2611000	2615000	They did Spy Hunter for the PS2 back in the day, and Spy Hunter was great.
2615000	2617000	So they're like, ah man, we'll do Defender.
2617000	2619000	Defender wasn't a bad game, but nobody cared.
2619000	2621000	And their treasures collections are awesome.
2621000	2625000	The Midway treasure collections they did on Xbox, like the 20 old games, like Rampage.
2625000	2627000	Yeah, they sell hand over fist.
2627000	2629000	You've got to wonder how they could be in that much trouble.
2629000	2635000	I guess the development budgets on their not-whoring-out-at-all franchises have just been out of control.
2635000	2640000	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was kind of their last hurrah, I think.
2640000	2643000	I've got to read this comment from Chad, because this is a good point.
2643000	2645000	I apologize if I'm mispronouncing his name.
2645000	2651000	In chat.orangetonshooter.com, Spike Guru says VOIP over 802.11b. Wouldn't that blow?
2651000	2656000	Because the DS isn't the most powerful wireless networking device.
2656000	2658000	Well, I mean, I don't know.
2658000	2664000	They said they had it working, or maybe they couldn't get it working, and that's why.
2664000	2667000	If they could make it work, you know.
2667000	2670000	I don't really see how much you're going to really need voice for Gauntlet.
2670000	2673000	I mean, it's nice, but it's Gauntlet.
2673000	2674000	True, true.
2674000	2675000	All right, well, maybe here's-
2675000	2678000	Hit that thing with an axe! Quick!
2678000	2681000	Grab the treasure!
2681000	2682000	No, my treasure!
2682000	2683000	Quit dying!
2683000	2691000	Elf shot the food.
2691000	2692000	Gauntlet, people!
2692000	2693000	Well, I don't know.
2693000	2695000	It's not that complex!
2695000	2696000	Whoops, shot the food.
2696000	2700000	Dan, maybe this is a game you would be more into for the DS.
2700000	2704000	Lego Battles is a game that's going to be coming out on the Nintendo DS.
2704000	2707000	It's coming from Warner Brothers and TT Games.
2707000	2708000	Robler's Tales.
2708000	2710000	TT. Telltale.
2710000	2711000	TT.
2711000	2713000	Titties!
2713000	2716000	It's a Lego-based strategy game, basically.
2716000	2719000	I think Loki's kind of talked about this a little bit on the show before.
2719000	2720000	Really?
2720000	2721000	Did I?
2721000	2726000	Officially, now, out there, that you're going to be, like, having bases that you're building and defending.
2726000	2730000	It's Lego castles, Lego's pirates, Lego's space-themed.
2730000	2732000	You're going to have units that you can actually-
2732000	2735000	You can actually have pirates and space people in the same team.
2735000	2737000	So, like, you can mix and match all this stuff.
2737000	2739000	You can tell there's Lego ninjas that just don't matter.
2739000	2746000	Well, actually, apparently, in the press release, you can have pirate swordsmen fighting wizards and aliens, dragons battling ninjas-
2746000	2749000	And that's going to be the greatest Lego game to ever happen.
2749000	2755000	Pirate ships launching broadsides against spacecraft and knights.
2755000	2757000	And you can also play this game local multiplayer.
2757000	2759000	Sadly, no V.O.I.P.
2759000	2762000	I'm sorry, pirate ship fighting a spaceship, that's just ridiculous.
2762000	2767000	I mean, seriously, what, it's a pirate ship, got cannons and shit, the spaceship's like,
2767000	2769000	I'm just going to fly higher, bitch.
2769000	2770000	Oh, you're dead.
2770000	2774000	They need to make a game like this, but, like, not Lego's.
2774000	2777000	You need to go old school and get, like, the Blacktron Lego's in there.
2777000	2784000	No, no offense against the Lego's, but I want to see, like, dragons versus spaceships for real.
2784000	2786000	I'm a fucking Duplo in this shit.
2786000	2791000	Duplo would totally dominate because they'd just be giant, indestructible blocks.
2791000	2793000	It's my pirate ship.
2793000	2797000	It'd be, like, tech level low, but resistance is, like, super high.
2797000	2801000	And cost, well, cost of anything Lego is just through the roof.
2801000	2803000	Boy, it's like construction fighter.
2803000	2805000	It could be Lego versus Mega Bloks.
2805000	2808000	Lego's and Duplo's and Tinker Toys and Lincoln Logs.
2808000	2812000	Have you seen the Mega Block Halo toys that they're doing?
2812000	2817000	You can get, like, Warthogs and Scorpion tanks and stuff all made of Mega Bloks.
2817000	2820000	There's a franchise that someone should have jumped on.
2820000	2824000	I know it was an April Fool's joke, but Lego Halo would have been sweet.
2824000	2829000	The chat room is talking about, like, a Lego fighting game, and the Rob D says you could lose parts as you fight.
2829000	2830000	That would be fun.
2830000	2832000	Yeah.
2832000	2834000	Just knock the blocks off of somebody. That'd be fun.
2834000	2836000	Lego Street Fighter.
2836000	2845000	Did you see, um, speaking of Legos also, did you see the pictures someone did of the Starcraft 2?
2845000	2847000	Yeah.
2847000	2851000	That person is my hero. That was the most awesome thing I've ever seen.
2851000	2853000	Very cool.
2853000	2858000	Alright, so Lego Battle's coming to the DS, I believe the release date's summertime, so we'll see.
2858000	2859000	April.
2859000	2861000	April, that's in time for my birthday.
2861000	2863000	Nice.
2863000	2866000	Ninjas and Dragons on Jamie's birthday. Who could ask for more?
2866000	2868000	Rock.
2868000	2871000	Well, for our UK friends, I'm so sorry.
2871000	2874000	It's just that this game is coming out as making me laugh.
2874000	2880000	They're bringing out a Coronation Street game on the DS, which is sort of like, as far as I know,
2880000	2888000	it's sort of like a weird soap opera-y type show out there, kind of like, what is it, the other one, EastEnders?
2888000	2890000	I think?
2890000	2894000	You look...
2894000	2896000	That wasn't on the mic.
2896000	2902000	Dan didn't say it in the mics, you guys didn't hear it, but he went way to cover the gaming news that matters.
2902000	2905000	We have listeners in the UK.
2905000	2912000	I also want to point out when Loki reads release dates, he reads things like Imagine Teacher and Imagine Baby's Dance Party.
2912000	2914000	Hey, I want to cover everything, okay?
2914000	2916000	So we have to cover everything.
2916000	2918000	So we can make fun of it.
2918000	2925000	There would be a hundred more people interested in what she's talking about than Imagine, you know, sitting around and fucking yourself.
2925000	2932000	Because you know what, if we're going to read release dates that matter to me, we wouldn't be reading anything.
2932000	2934000	Can I get my story, please?
2934000	2936000	Yes, you may.
2936000	2940000	This is the official STFU for me, thank you.
2940000	2948000	Anyway, yeah, Coronation Street is really, really popular, it has 78% of the UK's television audience.
2948000	2954000	So basically it's like, if you're going to watch TV and it's on, that's the only thing to watch, I guess.
2954000	2964000	But they're doing a DS game by, I don't really know too much about what's going into the game exactly as far as the play of it will be.
2964000	2970000	But it's supposed to be out for Christmas this year, so...
2970000	2974000	Yay, you get Coronation Street!
2974000	2977000	Did you do a little Briton DS game?
2977000	2980000	That PlayStation 2 one was awful.
2980000	2983000	Yeah, they did a PSP and PS2 game.
2983000	2985000	What?
2985000	2987000	Do not want.
2987000	2993000	I think that Top Gear and Doctor Who are the only things that justify the continued existence of the BBC.
2993000	2996000	Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.
2996000	2999000	Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures. Whatever that is.
2999000	3003000	Oh, and Primeval. Is Primeval still on?
3003000	3004000	What's that?
3004000	3006000	Primeval, that's a good show.
3006000	3009000	No, I haven't seen Primeval, but it might download to Merlin.
3009000	3013000	And the new series for afterlife on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, that's pretty decent.
3013000	3015000	It is, yes.
3015000	3020000	So there's actually lots of good stuff on BBC, but it really is about Doctor Who.
3020000	3024000	The staple of British television, in my opinion.
3024000	3028000	And Top Gear.
3028000	3035000	Going from something on the BBC to something that's very American.
3035000	3045000	Godfather 2, EA has delayed the release of the game because apparently releasing Godfather 2 on the same day as Killzone 2, not a good idea.
3045000	3053000	So they decided to hold it off a little bit. I believe now it's coming out the second quarter.
3053000	3056000	Beginning of April, probably.
3056000	3061000	So, cool. I don't know. I'm not too excited about Godfather. I didn't play the first one.
3061000	3065000	I mean, it's my type of game because it is like a Grand Theft Auto sandbox type of thing.
3065000	3067000	You owe it to yourself to pick it up and try it.
3067000	3071000	It actually is a pretty sick game as long as you don't get too much respect.
3071000	3075000	Because then you stop being able to shake the crap out of people and make them bend your will.
3075000	3082000	Because you can just walk into a store and just grab the dude and beat him up until he gives you what you want and you'd be like, that's awesome.
3082000	3083000	Sweet.
3083000	3090000	See, I'm wondering if Godfather 2, because I haven't read much about it, if it takes place further in the past, like when Vito Corleone was a kid.
3090000	3093000	Or if it's going to be just like, oh, there's more Godfather.
3093000	3095000	I think it's a continuation.
3095000	3097000	That's not as cool.
3097000	3101000	And they basically have now online multiplayer as well.
3101000	3106000	Yeah, that's probably mostly the whole attraction.
3106000	3109000	Multiplayer would be fun, though. Then you can slap your friends.
3109000	3111000	I want a Scarface, too.
3111000	3115000	Scarface, you know, and it was kind of like, oh, he didn't die.
3115000	3120000	He didn't die and he did it all again because he was so happy the first time.
3120000	3125000	Told him a tenner and I'm an idiot. Jesus.
3125000	3130000	All right. As long as this time when they do the portable versions, they don't make them into strategy games.
3130000	3134000	Because seriously, everyone comes to my store and wants to buy the portable Scarface game.
3134000	3137000	And I'm like, fine, buy it. Then they bring it back like ten minutes later.
3137000	3139000	What is this crap? It's a strategy game.
3139000	3141000	Well, you should have read the back of the book.
3141000	3146000	I wanted to run around and shoot people. I'm talking right now.
3146000	3152000	This is why people need to read the reviews and look at the back of the box. Dumbasses.
3152000	3157000	All we have is a disc. Can you look at the back of the disc?
3157000	3163000	I'm saying in general, Dan, and people, you can look online and find reviews.
3163000	3169000	I think it's a safe assumption that if the box looks the same and it's on the PS2 and the PSP, it should be largely the same game.
3169000	3172000	But it's not. So you're right. Kind of.
3172000	3181000	Oh, and I was going to say, too, I mean, we shouldn't, you know, be harking too much on the UK for having a TV drama being turned into a game.
3181000	3187000	Because after all, Ubisoft is bringing out Grey's Anatomy for the DS and the Wii.
3187000	3189000	It could have played like Trauma Center.
3189000	3191000	It is supposed to play like Trauma Center, but with more drama.
3191000	3193000	Aren't they downsizing that team?
3193000	3194000	Sadly, there's an audience.
3194000	3196000	Good developers are getting fired.
3196000	3201000	Sadly, there's an audience for that, too. You know, there are people, plenty of people that will probably buy that game.
3201000	3206000	I sold one copy of Hell's Kitchen on the Wii. One.
3206000	3211000	OK? There's not an audience for that. I mean, unless they're buying it somewhere besides game stores.
3211000	3214000	It's terrible. Why are they making all this crap?
3214000	3216000	I like cooking and yelling.
3216000	3222000	Honestly, the Nintendo Wii, and you heard it here, if you're listening, one of the dozens and dozens of listeners on Orange is on the Radio.
3222000	3229000	If you're listening, I'm saying it now, the Nintendo Wii is going to cause gaming Armageddon.
3229000	3233000	It's the return of the Atari 2600. It's shovelware.
3233000	3239000	They're putting anything they can on it to try to make a quick buck. Come on, they're making Grey's Anatomy.
3239000	3241000	No. That's terrible.
3241000	3243000	It will probably be better than E.T.
3243000	3245000	The Nintendo DS is probably that, too.
3245000	3247000	It will probably still be better than E.T.
3247000	3256000	I don't know. Really, if you played E.T. when that game came out on Atari, it had, like, music, and the character was animated.
3256000	3260000	And when you were young and didn't understand, it didn't suck that bad.
3260000	3264000	All the people who bang on E.T. now never even played it.
3264000	3268000	I did play it. I fell in the hole 50 gazillion times.
3268000	3270000	Your wife wants to say something bad.
3270000	3272000	It's because you suck at video games. Seriously.
3272000	3274000	E.T. was not that bad a game.
3274000	3276000	Yes, Atari was arrogant.
3276000	3280000	Yes, they made more copies than there were 2600s, which is terrible.
3280000	3282000	Give, give, give.
3282000	3284000	Dan.
3284000	3286000	We get it.
3286000	3288000	No, no, no.
3288000	3290000	I have the story.
3290000	3292000	Did you even beat E.T.?
3292000	3294000	No, I never did. No one ever has.
3294000	3296000	In the existence of mankind.
3296000	3298000	There's a YouTube video of someone beating E.T.
3298000	3300000	YouTube videos can be fixed, sir.
3300000	3302000	Whatever.
3302000	3306000	Yes, when you beat E.T., the real E.T. comes out, and it's actually a good game.
3306000	3312000	The real E.T. comes out, shakes your hand, and goes to space.
3312000	3318000	No, I was going to say, E.T.'s a notorious bomb, but that's because Atari produced more copies than there were a dying system.
3318000	3324000	Well, I mean, they also have, what is it, Prison Break coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3324000	3326000	Why that game now?
3326000	3330000	And some other examples of really quality stuff on the Wii.
3330000	3336000	We have a game coming out that's supposed to tie into a Garfield movie that came out two years ago.
3336000	3341000	Now coming out on the Wii because it's been delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, delayed, and delayed some more.
3341000	3343000	We have ghosts.
3343000	3345000	Oh my god.
3345000	3349000	I seriously think we're about ready to have Armageddon live here in studio.
3349000	3351000	There's a storm going on outside.
3351000	3353000	Weemageddon!
3353000	3357000	That last burst of wind almost blew over the garage door. That's going to be scary.
3357000	3359000	This is what we hear outside.
3359000	3363000	Whenever you get the little awning piece from the roof, it's like...
3363000	3367000	It'll be live on Justin.TV, too, when we all get blown away.
3367000	3369000	I will get blown away.
3369000	3371000	You're controlling the apocalypse.
3371000	3373000	You're all fucked.
3375000	3377000	Can I read a Turok story?
3377000	3379000	Rob, do your story, please.
3379000	3381000	I'm going to read a Turok story.
3381000	3383000	ET is officially banned on Orange Lounge Radio.
3383000	3385000	No way. Veto'd.
3385000	3387000	I have to say a word that I just heard.
3387000	3389000	Weemageddon.
3389000	3391000	You should copyright the word.
3391000	3395000	Copyright? Dude, bad. You should copyright that.
3395000	3397000	It's my word! I said Weemageddon.
3397000	3399000	The mats are fighting over Weemageddon.
3399000	3401000	Weemageddon getting out of here.
3403000	3405000	You can have Weemageddon.
3405000	3407000	Go back on the tape, please.
3407000	3409000	Look, moving on. Turok.
3409000	3411000	Turokageddon.
3411000	3415000	Turok, of course, was reinvented recently on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and all that.
3415000	3417000	I didn't play it. Did you play it?
3417000	3419000	There's a franchise that needs a comeback.
3419000	3421000	Oh, wait. No, it didn't.
3421000	3423000	Apparently some folks agree with you.
3423000	3425000	Turok 2, rumor is it's been canned.
3425000	3427000	Before it was even announced.
3427000	3430000	Apparently this is because of some layoffs that just happened to Disney.
3430000	3432000	Again, this is all kind of rumored.
3432000	3434000	Had nothing to do with the poor sales of the first game.
3434000	3439000	But they say maybe Turok 2 will return to development someday,
3439000	3442000	but a bunch of the core people that were doing it are no longer there.
3442000	3445000	But here's the sad thing. Apparently propaganda games that was making this game
3445000	3449000	were also the people that were supposed to be doing the Tron game for the new Tron title.
3449000	3451000	So they all might have been sacked.
3451000	3457000	Better find people to do the Tron game, or I will personally go there with steel-toed boots
3457000	3459000	and kick every last one of them in the nuts.
3459000	3461000	Here, you want to make some money? I'll tell you how you do it.
3461000	3463000	It's very simple, okay?
3463000	3465000	You take the Left 4 Dead concept,
3465000	3469000	Jurassic Park, your surviving dinosaur attacks, and that's it.
3469000	3471000	They did that. It sucked.
3471000	3473000	Actually, that would be pretty awesome.
3473000	3477000	They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game.
3477000	3482000	They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game, and it blew.
3482000	3484000	It was scary. No, that was the one on Super Nintendo.
3484000	3486000	That scared the shit out of me.
3486000	3489000	It was the Sega CD one, but the arcade one blew too.
3489000	3492000	No, I'm talking Left 4 Dead with dinosaurs.
3492000	3496000	That would be cool. I'm down for that.
3496000	3499000	This is the game that they need to make.
3499000	3504000	This is the game that they need to make using the Left 4 Dead engine.
3504000	3509000	They need to do Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness.
3509000	3511000	They did comics.
3511000	3514000	How about Goats vs. Dogs?
3514000	3516000	How about I do my story?
3516000	3518000	How about I read a chat comment real quick?
3518000	3520000	There's actually some insightful stuff from chat.
3520000	3523000	TheRobD actually says something a little bit insightful,
3523000	3525000	so I have to go to chat for insightful comments tonight
3525000	3527000	because no one in the studio is saying anything.
3527000	3529000	TheRobD says,
3529000	3534000	Is it funny that we take it for granted that a game will have a sequel, isn't it?
3534000	3538000	So we're kind of all new to Rock 2 is going to be coming at some point.
3538000	3541000	Don't we all kind of take it for granted that sometimes we're going to be getting sequels?
3541000	3544000	Well, because some of these games, regardless of the quality of them,
3544000	3546000	they keep putting out sequels.
3546000	3548000	For example, Transformers.
3548000	3552000	Well, it's because I think if the first one makes any remote amount of money,
3552000	3554000	because people aren't willing to do anything original
3554000	3558000	because they want to stick to those franchises that they think are going to sell.
3558000	3562000	I mean, thank God we have, you know, Freaky Guy bringing us Noby Noby Boy
3562000	3564000	or else we'd have nothing original.
3564000	3566000	And yet they still won't bring us Guardian Legend 2.
3566000	3568000	I know!
3568000	3570000	I'm sorry, Noby Noby Boy isn't that original looking.
3570000	3572000	It looks just like Katamari.
3572000	3575000	Well, you know the video games industry is doomed
3575000	3578000	because they made another Turok after Turok Evolution.
3578000	3582000	And Turok Evolution, for anyone who played that game, was bad.
3582000	3586000	Really, really bad. Not a good game.
3586000	3590000	Was it as bad as Superman 64?
3590000	3591000	Yeah.
3591000	3595000	And then they went and made Superman Returns, which was not very good either.
3595000	3598000	That wasn't a sequel to Superman. I mean, there's a difference between a sequel.
3598000	3600000	It was a reboot.
3600000	3603000	Yeah, that's kind of like what Turok, this last Turok was.
3603000	3607000	And actually, it was the last Turok reboot was Evolution and it was horrible.
3607000	3614000	And Superman Returns, which was not a bad game if you only paid ten bucks for it.
3614000	3616000	Sixty bucks? No, ten bucks? Yeah.
3616000	3620000	You know, you could be Superman and you could blow cars around and tear up Metropolis
3620000	3622000	and that actually hurt you.
3622000	3624000	Okay, here's a better example then.
3624000	3627000	I did not play Superman 64 expecting Superman 2600
3627000	3632000	where you would fly and then be chased by the kryptonite.
3632000	3635000	Superman for the 2600 was sweet.
3635000	3638000	Superman 64 managed to be worse than that.
3638000	3641000	Because the expectations were higher.
3641000	3644000	Because the 64 should have had a good game where you flew around and did interesting things.
3644000	3647000	Loki, go ahead. We got to keep the news moving because we're like an hour into the show.
3647000	3649000	I think it's my story actually.
3649000	3651000	Well, Hugh had a quick thought and then we'll move on.
3651000	3655000	Yeah, so I was going to say Activision, Neil, the purveyor of fine games,
3655000	3662000	decided that Pimp My Ride the game was so awesome that they're going to put out Pimp My Ride street racing.
3662000	3666000	Yes, Pimp My Ride the game. Awful, awful, awful.
3666000	3673000	I hate to say it, I have to talk people out of buying Pimp My Ride almost every day.
3673000	3679000	Alright, let's move on to some release dates, try to keep things moving forward here.
3679000	3682000	We're going to start off in the UK, Dark Sakura, what's coming to the UK?
3682000	3687000	For our UK listeners, on the 10th is Tomb Raider Underworld Beneath the Ashes on Xbox 360.
3687000	3691000	On the 12th is Flower for Playstation 3 which I really don't know anything about.
3691000	3693000	It's like flow but with flowers.
3693000	3695000	That sounds kind of cool.
3695000	3703000	Also on the 13th we have Bomberman 2 on DS, yay Bomberman.
3703000	3707000	Deadly Creatures on Wii, Eternal Sonata on Playstation 3,
3707000	3711000	Fear 2 Project Origin on PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3,
3711000	3717000	Kings Bounty the Legend on PC, Last King of Africa on DS,
3717000	3721000	Mushroom Men sounds hallucinogenic, that's for PC,
3721000	3729000	Shell Shock 2, Trails on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360,
3729000	3732000	Star Ocean the Second Evolution on PSP,
3732000	3736000	and The House of the Dead Overkill on Wii because you can't kill enough zombies.
3736000	3739000	Alright, very cool.
3739000	3742000	In the US there is actually quite a bit coming out as well.
3742000	3747000	Fear 2 Project Origin on both PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3747000	3752000	X-Blades coming out on PC, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360.
3752000	3755000	Deadly Creatures coming out on the Wii.
3755000	3762000	Let's see, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.
3762000	3765000	You love remakes, this shit looks hot.
3765000	3768000	This game they're doing there, they're gonna be upgrading them all to 720.
3768000	3770000	Sadly they won't be widescreen.
3770000	3774000	But supposedly some classic arcade games are locked away too.
3774000	3777000	Congo Bongo is in there right here.
3777000	3779000	We did it all that last Genesis Collection.
3779000	3782000	It's like you play so many games and you unlock the arcade version of Altered Beast.
3782000	3784000	This Genesis Collection looks really awesome.
3784000	3789000	It's like 40 games, some really good stuff.
3789000	3791000	40 games for 30 bucks.
3791000	3793000	Well, and they're Genesis games.
3793000	3798000	Genesis is the superior 16-bit system, so obviously you don't see a lot of Super Nintendo collections.
3798000	3803000	I have to say, I'm sometimes not a big fan of these remakes and stuff,
3803000	3804000	but this looks pretty hot.
3804000	3806000	This isn't even really a remake, it's just a collection.
3806000	3808000	It's a repackaging.
3808000	3811000	Well sure, but I mean a remake is, you know, they make it three years.
3811000	3814000	Loco Roco 2 on PSP.
3814000	3820000	Then on the Wii and the Xbox 360 we have Oni Chambara Bikini Zombie Slayer.
3820000	3821000	Yes!
3821000	3825000	And on Xbox 360 Oni Chambara Bikini Samurai Squad.
3825000	3827000	Have you seen the cover art for that game?
3827000	3834000	This game is so epic that they made a movie for it in Japan.
3834000	3835000	A theatrical movie.
3835000	3837000	I'm going to be so broke this week.
3837000	3839000	I'll bring you some cover art. It's fantastic.
3839000	3842000	Let's see here.
3842000	3846000	Then we've also got some other crap that no one cares about.
3846000	3849000	Jake Power Fireman for the little kids.
3849000	3855000	NASCAR Kart Racing because, you know, the Wii doesn't need a true NASCAR game.
3855000	3857000	That would be insulting to its audience.
3857000	3862000	My do-it-all for the DS, which is like a PDA device.
3862000	3868000	Retro Game Challenge, which is a collection of a bunch of fake 8-bit games.
3868000	3869000	That's kind of neat.
3869000	3873000	House of the Dead Overkill, which will be truly epic.
3873000	3877000	Mass Effect is getting re-released as a two-disc edition.
3877000	3879000	They're going to have the download content in it as well.
3879000	3884000	And it's going to be $19.99, so that's pretty sweet.
3884000	3889000	And let's see here.
3889000	3891000	And that's actually it.
3891000	3893000	What's kind of interesting, though, is also this week...
3893000	3895000	Is this Street Fighter IV this week?
3895000	3896000	No.
3896000	3897000	No, that's next week.
3897000	3898000	Aw, dammit!
3898000	3899000	Ha ha!
3899000	3900000	Blame.
3900000	3905000	Anyways, also, actually technically still this week,
3905000	3909000	Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon, I believe, will be coming out next...
3909000	3910000	16th?
3910000	3914000	Actually, well, no, never mind, that's supposed to be Tuesday, so that's next week.
3914000	3915000	That game's going to be great.
3915000	3918000	And then I think Lost in the Damned this week,
3918000	3921000	or Lost in the Damned for Grand Theft Auto IV.
3921000	3924000	So that is what I'm really looking forward to.
3924000	3927000	Man, I thought Street Fighter IV was this week.
3927000	3929000	No, it's next week.
3929000	3930000	What are you still thinking, Rob?
3930000	3931000	Blame.
3931000	3932000	Well, guess what?
3932000	3934000	They get in Japan this week.
3934000	3937000	Street Fighter IV on February 12th, coming to Japan.
3937000	3941000	Well, hopefully it's region-free.
3941000	3945000	And has English options, because I can't read Japanese, sadly.
3945000	3946000	It's Street Fighter.
3946000	3947000	Yeah.
3947000	3948000	Well, I know, I know.
3948000	3950000	But then I don't get those awesome endings.
3950000	3954000	I'm just hoping that the US one has the option to turn off the dub soundtrack.
3954000	3955000	I think I heard it does.
3955000	3956000	Good.
3956000	3959000	PlayStation 3, you also get Street Fighter IV in Japan,
3959000	3962000	but you also get Skate 2 gets a release in Japan on the 12th of February,
3962000	3964000	because games come out on Fridays over there, I believe.
3964000	3969000	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Mobile Suit Gundam.
3969000	3971000	Another one of those games from Bandai Namco.
3971000	3975000	This one's called Giren no Yabu Access no Kyui 5.
3975000	3977000	So yet another Gundam game.
3977000	3982000	On the DS, it doesn't look like there's actually a lot of stuff coming out.
3982000	3988000	There's a game called Hitamari Sketch, Doko Demo Sugoruku X365.
3988000	3989000	And I have no idea.
3989000	3991000	I'm trying to look at screen caps for this game.
3991000	3992000	Just saying it is fun.
3992000	3993000	Yeah, I know, just saying it is fun.
3993000	3997000	It looks like it's another minigame collection on the DS,
3997000	3999000	made up of little WarioWare-ish minigames,
3999000	4001000	kind of what it looks like to me.
4001000	4003000	I guess that could be cute.
4003000	4006000	But they're all cute little Japanese schoolgirls on there.
4006000	4009000	And on the Sony PSP this week, not a whole lot,
4009000	4012000	but you do have Tenchu 4 looks to be a pretty big release
4012000	4013000	coming out over there this week,
4013000	4016000	as well as a port of the Gundam game that's on PS2 this week.
4016000	4018000	Otherwise, a pretty quiet week in Japan,
4018000	4022000	probably because of Street Fighter IV pretty much dominating.
4022000	4024000	So there you go.
4024000	4026000	There's your release dates for Japan.
4026000	4029000	So let's get back and do some more gaming news.
4029000	4034000	Well, we have our Virtual Fighter.
4034000	4038000	Virtual Console UK news coming out,
4038000	4041000	actually should already be out as of Friday,
4041000	4046000	is Clay Fighter, which is on there for 800 Wii points,
4046000	4050000	the equivalent of six pounds or eight euros.
4050000	4053000	And the other game that's on there is Sonic Chaos,
4053000	4061000	which was a Master System game and is 500 Wii points.
4061000	4064000	So it was actually the first Sonic game that had Tails playable.
4064000	4066000	There you go.
4066000	4070000	Is Clay Fighter on the US Virtual Console?
4070000	4073000	If you can pull that down, that game is great.
4073000	4076000	I stopped following Virtual Console a while ago.
4076000	4078000	I don't know if we ever got Secret of Mana.
4078000	4081000	Secret of Mana is supposed to be on the UK one, I thought.
4081000	4084000	Jeez, I don't think we got that here yet.
4084000	4092000	Seriously though, Clay Fighter, you can be a Clay Elvis fighting a Clay-like Norse Valkyrie chick.
4092000	4093000	Helga.
4093000	4094000	Fighting a blob.
4094000	4095000	Clay Fighter.
4095000	4096000	Clay Fighter.
4096000	4100000	Come on, fight them if you dare.
4100000	4104000	Clay Fighter, great.
4104000	4108000	There was a viral video making this round this week
4108000	4112000	that supposedly was a leaked Dead Rising 2 trailer.
4112000	4115000	And we know all about leaked trailers
4115000	4121000	that they sometimes tend to be not leaked by someone stealing it,
4121000	4123000	but they're leaked on purpose.
4123000	4128000	This was shot off of a screen, apparently, off a TV.
4128000	4132000	And it showed what looks to be a teaser trailer.
4132000	4140000	Basically, it looks almost like an overrun Las Vegas-type area with casinos.
4140000	4149000	One seemed to show someone in a giant American Gladiators hamster ball thing rolling over zombies.
4149000	4153000	So, to be honest, I think it's actually authentic.
4153000	4156000	And I think it is purposely released by Capcom
4156000	4162000	because the audio in it, if you notice, is actually a direct feed from the trailers.
4162000	4166000	So, it's not just shot off a TV audio.
4166000	4169000	Any idea if we're going to get some multiplayer co-op in this?
4169000	4171000	Because that's what Dead Rising needed.
4171000	4176000	It was a great game, but man, if it had, sort of like Left 4 Dead,
4176000	4181000	multiple players in the Dead Rising kind of gameplay against millions of zombies.
4181000	4183000	Oh, dude.
4183000	4186000	Yeah, no idea what it is exactly, but I know at the very end of the trailer
4186000	4189000	it actually flashes the number 2 really quick.
4189000	4193000	And there's also another scene that you see Frank Wesson in the Mega Man outfit again.
4193000	4195000	I've been in a war.
4195000	4199000	Can I say, though, that Capcom has a really good pulse on where we want to kill zombies?
4199000	4202000	Because when I saw this trailer and saw that the next one is in Vegas or whatever,
4202000	4204000	I was like, that's awesome.
4204000	4205000	No doubt.
4205000	4208000	Just like when I saw the first one, it was killing zombies in a mall. That's awesome.
4208000	4212000	There's one company that knows killing zombies, that knows slaying the undead. It's Capcom.
4212000	4216000	Let me put it this way. If this is fake, it's an amazing fake.
4216000	4218000	Yeah.
4218000	4222000	And maybe Capcom should do this if this is a fake.
4222000	4224000	For real.
4224000	4226000	But I will be willing to bet that you'll see this at E3.
4226000	4228000	Easy.
4228000	4230000	Start the buzz now.
4230000	4235000	What better way to get people talking about it than put out a trailer that's supposedly stolen, you know?
4235000	4240000	Make a demo for E3 of E3 infested with zombies.
4240000	4243000	That actually would be pretty badass.
4243000	4245000	And you killing people are zombies.
4245000	4248000	Or maybe in the reverse, you're a zombie and you're killing people.
4248000	4252000	Well, the buzz is also starting on this game. It's Saw.
4252000	4254000	The game.
4254000	4259000	You know, this is weird because I heard before that Saw was supposed to be coming out.
4259000	4261000	It was in development and then got cancelled.
4261000	4264000	Well, apparently now Konami has picked up the rights to do Saw.
4264000	4267000	I guess Brash Entertainment had started this game and stopped it.
4267000	4271000	And now Konami has actually picked up the rights since that other company closed down.
4271000	4274000	Variety was the one to actually report this.
4274000	4276000	The game is now going to be developed by Zombie Studios.
4276000	4280000	And it's supposed to come out right when the sixth Saw movie comes out this Halloween.
4280000	4282000	And I'm like, they really are on Saw 6?
4282000	4285000	It doesn't seem like something you can adapt into a game at all.
4285000	4287000	I mean, it just doesn't work for me.
4287000	4289000	I don't see how you're going to be able to do it.
4289000	4291000	You know what?
4291000	4295000	To the dismay of fans of it in the room, I can foresee this.
4295000	4298000	If Konami makes Saw and it's a hit, it will kill Silent Hill.
4298000	4300000	Oh, I know. That's the sad thing.
4300000	4303000	And, you know, because I'm thinking in my head, I'm like, well, okay.
4303000	4305000	But wait a minute. Konami's done Silent Hill.
4305000	4307000	Granted, these are two completely different developers.
4307000	4309000	I've never really heard of this Zombie Studios before.
4309000	4310000	They have nothing to do with Silent Hill.
4310000	4312000	But I'm like, well, okay.
4312000	4314000	Silent Hill is actually a pretty rad game.
4314000	4316000	So, like, if they made Saw, like, kind of like a game like that.
4316000	4319000	But I'm like, I just don't see Saw being a game like that.
4319000	4321000	I don't think it's going to work.
4321000	4323000	I think it's just going to be gross killing.
4323000	4326000	And it's sad. I don't think Homecoming did well.
4326000	4329000	They're doing everything they can to stem the tie.
4329000	4331000	They tried to action up Homecoming.
4331000	4334000	They tried to do the remake, the Origins one.
4334000	4337000	And, you know, that's all Konami needs.
4337000	4339000	If they come up with another horror franchise,
4339000	4341000	they'll probably put Silent Hill out to pasture.
4341000	4343000	Yeah, I don't know how well Homecoming did.
4343000	4346000	But I'm worried that there may not be a sixth one.
4346000	4349000	So, I hope you're wrong.
4349000	4351000	But sadly, you might be right.
4351000	4353000	So, don't buy the Saw game.
4353000	4355000	Lee M'Geddon.
4355000	4357000	But honestly, though, I mean,
4357000	4359000	I don't see how they're going to be able to do it.
4359000	4361000	It's just, it's not...
4361000	4364000	Saw isn't a franchise that's really action-packed or anything.
4364000	4365000	And, I mean, it's...
4365000	4367000	Neither is Silent Hill.
4367000	4369000	Well, Silent Hill is easy...
4369000	4372000	They'll just do the same thing, except for you'll be dodging, like,
4372000	4374000	traps made by the Saw guy.
4374000	4377000	And, you know, every once in a while you get yourself into some sort of weird ethical dilemma
4377000	4379000	where you have to kill somebody.
4379000	4382000	And honestly, it sounds like they might be able to make a pretty cool game out of it.
4382000	4384000	I'd buy it.
4384000	4386000	We'll see. We'll check it out at E3.
4386000	4387000	Just to kill Silent Hill.
4387000	4390000	Jamie, you express a lot of dish pleasure at the news of a Saw game.
4390000	4391000	Are you excited about it?
4391000	4393000	I will stab you in the face.
4393000	4394000	Oh, it might be...
4394000	4395000	If you buy the Saw game.
4395000	4397000	Saw in real life.
4397000	4399000	No, because, first of all,
4399000	4402000	the concept of Saw is, well, retarded.
4402000	4404000	Sorry!
4404000	4405000	And not very interesting.
4405000	4407000	And how can you...
4407000	4409000	I guess, you know, if Nightmare on Elm Street did...
4409000	4412000	You know, this is, I guess, our Nightmare on Elm Street for the modern age, except,
4412000	4415000	you know, Freddy Krueger was funny.
4415000	4417000	But...
4417000	4420000	And the fact that they're now rebooting Friday the 13th, right?
4420000	4421000	There's that new movie coming out.
4421000	4422000	But Jared Padalecki's in it.
4422000	4423000	And, uh...
4423000	4424000	And it does look cool.
4424000	4427000	The, uh, Nightmare on Elm Street, they're also doing without Robert Englund.
4427000	4428000	Which will not work.
4428000	4429000	You can't...
4429000	4431000	But Robert Englund in there, he's not doing anything.
4431000	4433000	I mean, seriously, who's here?
4433000	4435000	He's slowly dying. That's why they can't put him in it.
4435000	4437000	It doesn't matter!
4437000	4439000	He's old!
4439000	4441000	He's dying of old!
4441000	4443000	Anyway...
4443000	4447000	My point is, is that, you know,
4447000	4448000	Saw is a gimmick.
4448000	4451000	Silent Hill, you know, basically,
4451000	4456000	a lot of thought went into the psychology of the game.
4456000	4463000	And it created its own sort of mythology around what made that universe work.
4463000	4464000	You know what I mean?
4464000	4465000	Yeah, in other words, Pyramid Head is not a gimmick.
4465000	4467000	He's a fucking rock star.
4467000	4470000	They should stop putting him in every single game.
4470000	4474000	But my point is that...
4474000	4478000	I mean, sure, if you want mindless bullshit in a game,
4478000	4479000	get Saw. Go for it.
4479000	4481000	Buy mindless bullshit.
4481000	4483000	If you want a game that's gonna make you, you know, think a little bit
4483000	4485000	and actually use your brain...
4485000	4486000	And possibly pee your pants.
4486000	4488000	And possibly pee your pants, yes.
4488000	4489000	Go for Silent Hill.
4489000	4492000	Besides that Silent Hill 2, Chainsaw.
4492000	4495000	Perfect.
4495000	4497000	Silent Hill of Superior.
4497000	4499000	Alright, let's move on with some other gaming news.
4499000	4501000	We're like an hour fifteen into this show.
4501000	4503000	We're not even close to the end of a...
4503000	4507000	This is why Dan comes once every five years.
4507000	4508000	Dan's funny.
4508000	4509000	If you didn't want to hear from me, you wouldn't have invited me.
4509000	4511000	We like Dan. We like Dan. He's funny.
4511000	4515000	I invited my sweetie here and cuddled with him and said,
4515000	4517000	Come be on the show.
4517000	4520000	He goes, okay, and then lost his phone.
4520000	4522000	Anyway.
4522000	4524000	So the...
4524000	4526000	We gotta go to Jamie for our next story.
4526000	4530000	Oh, sorry. I didn't realize she hadn't done the other story yet.
4530000	4534000	Anyway, anyway, anyway.
4534000	4538000	Guess what we were speaking earlier about series getting a reboot.
4538000	4540000	So guess what's next in line?
4540000	4542000	Splatterhouse.
4542000	4545000	Which totally makes sense with Friday the 13th getting its reboot
4545000	4549000	because then you've got Dude in a Hockey Mask.
4549000	4552000	And freaking Splatterhouse is awesome.
4552000	4555000	I love the picture on the little article because I was the guy with the chainsaw hands.
4555000	4557000	Anyway.
4557000	4560000	And as we all know, the game is actually out on Virtual Console right now.
4560000	4562000	But they're talking later this year.
4562000	4569000	Namco Bondi is planning Quarter 3 for doing a new Splatterhouse game.
4569000	4574000	And there actually is an official site up.
4574000	4577000	If you go to splatterhousegame.com,
4577000	4584000	you can see some of the images from the game.
4584000	4586000	And you can actually now...
4586000	4591000	This is the first game that lets you use your own severed limbs as a weapon.
4591000	4595000	Yeah, your arms and stuff and your skin will get ripped off as you're playing the game
4595000	4597000	or as you're getting damage done to you.
4597000	4601000	And your limbs will grow back and you can actually beat people with your limbs.
4601000	4603000	This won't be rated M or anything.
4603000	4609000	There's a lot of controversy about this because apparently Namco just whacked the dev team for this game.
4609000	4612000	Which was a California-based developer.
4612000	4618000	I don't know if they handed it to another team or if the game is going to be back or in limbo.
4618000	4620000	I heard the Afro Samurai people might be able to take it.
4620000	4625000	Or the arm of the developer got cut off and given to the other team to use in developing the game.
4625000	4630000	This news, though, is coming right out of New York Comic-Con which was going on this weekend.
4630000	4634000	Right, so it's interesting that we hear the dev team get sacked,
4634000	4638000	yet they're showing it at New York Comic-Con going on this weekend.
4638000	4640000	Which is crazy, so it's interesting.
4640000	4642000	Oh, that's the corporate world.
4642000	4645000	Fast-paced, ever-changing world of video game development.
4645000	4649000	Exactly, but that's okay because in Splatterhouse they'll grow the limbs back.
4649000	4650000	It's alright.
4650000	4654000	Anyhow, a couple more stories and we'll get to the classic game of the week in a break.
4654000	4665000	Alright, well there is a brand new update that they did to fix the HDMI audio issues that they were having with the HDMI audio cable for the 360.
4665000	4671000	However, as with most updates, it seems, there are some problems.
4671000	4677000	And apparently a lot of people are reporting that after this update was downloaded to their Xbox 360 system,
4677000	4687000	that they received the brand new present of an E74 error message, which is one of the one red light problem.
4687000	4693000	And it's funny because that also happens to be not covered by their warranty.
4693000	4698000	D'oh! And sad trombone.
4698000	4702000	And so, yeah, a lot of people are pissed off at that.
4702000	4708000	You mean Microsoft developed a game console with a problem.
4708000	4712000	No! No!
4712000	4715000	I've taken back six Xboxes in the last week.
4715000	4717000	Was it all because of this update?
4717000	4719000	No, those things just break.
4719000	4721000	They don't have to update them to break.
4721000	4723000	Microsoft don't even worry about updating them. They're just going to break!
4723000	4725000	You look at them funny and they'll break.
4725000	4727000	Seriously?
4727000	4729000	It's like the Xbox has feelings.
4729000	4732000	You look at me funny and I'm going to shut down.
4732000	4734000	You used me to do all your gaming and bought stuff for me!
4734000	4739000	I just want to cuddle!
4739000	4744000	Oh, but you know, I love when they ask you on the phone, was it plugged into a search protector?
4744000	4749000	Oh yes, it was the search protector's fault that my console broke.
4749000	4756000	Alright, look, we got a segment we don't do on the show very often,
4756000	4761000	but when we do it, it's just because there's such stupidity that goes on out there in the world
4761000	4765000	that sometimes video games get a bad name.
4765000	4770000	That's why we have to give out a stupid award.
4770000	4774000	This week's stupid award goes to Daniel Alvarez.
4774000	4776000	He lives in Austin, Texas.
4776000	4778000	Why does he get the stupid award?
4778000	4782000	Because he got arrested on charges of assault.
4782000	4790000	Because what he did, he assaulted his girlfriend with a Wii controller.
4790000	4796000	Also, and possibly the even more hideous crime as reported,
4796000	4800000	he's also suspected of eating her cookies.
4800000	4805000	He seriously jumped up behind her with the nunchuck strap and like super spider with it.
4805000	4806000	Yes.
4806000	4808000	Like it's like a Rottwein.
4808000	4811000	Wait, I'm not done. I'm not done.
4811000	4813000	Look, like this is one of those things.
4813000	4819000	Look, we got this report off of Kotaku, and this is like one of those things that's so stupid,
4819000	4822000	I'm not wondering if they just made the damn thing up.
4822000	4824000	Like, seriously?
4824000	4826000	I'm looking at this. No, listen to this.
4826000	4831000	Apparently, Christina Alvarado, who is the girlfriend,
4831000	4835000	what happened is that she actually told the police that she was attacked by her boyfriend,
4835000	4843000	and the thing was, she was pissed off at him because he ate her Girl Scout cookies.
4843000	4849000	And he was pissed off because he got woke up to get yelled at about the Girl Scout cookies.
4849000	4852000	So I guess to teach her a lesson, he choked her with a Wii controller.
4852000	4855000	Don't you dare. Ever.
4855000	4860000	Because I wake him up all the time for eating my stuff out of the fridge.
4860000	4864000	I was going to kill you. It would not be with a Wii controller.
4864000	4867000	Well, the unofficial city motto of Austin is keep Austin weird.
4867000	4869000	That's frickin' weird right there.
4869000	4873000	So I might go ahead and lean on that one to be true.
4873000	4877000	And FYI, it does not appear to be made up.
4877000	4880000	They've linked to a source here that apparently says, yes,
4880000	4885000	an Austin man has been accused of trying to choke his girlfriend with a cord of a Wii video game controller
4885000	4890000	after she became angry that he had eaten all of her Girl Scout cookies.
4890000	4891000	You know what the gag is, though?
4891000	4894000	For the people who don't know about the way that the nunchuck works
4894000	4901000	is that all Wii controllers are cordless.
4901000	4904000	I bet that damage that any cords would not be covered under the warranty.
4904000	4906000	I wonder if that's what the defense attorney will try to say.
4906000	4912000	All she would have to do is yank hard and unplug it.
4912000	4917000	If you have the other hand on the remote, the other hand on the nunchuck.
4917000	4919000	I want to know what type of cookies they were
4919000	4921000	because if they were Samoas, I kind of understand.
4921000	4923000	They're not Samoas anymore, Rob.
4923000	4926000	No, they are always Samoas. I don't give a shit what they're calling them on the box.
4926000	4928000	I agree. And Thin Mints.
4928000	4930000	Caramel sucks a lot.
4930000	4932000	I need to know one thing.
4932000	4933000	Yes.
4933000	4935000	Was he wearing the wrist strap?
4935000	4941000	No, no. Even better, even better, did it have the condom on?
4941000	4943000	See, the mats think alike here.
4943000	4945000	I was going to say the exact same thing before Loki took the mic away.
4945000	4949000	So, yes, we need to know if it had the Wii condom on and the safety strap.
4949000	4951000	Because if it didn't have the safety strap on, Nintendo would have...
4951000	4953000	They're not dealing with that.
4953000	4957000	Isn't it even funnier if somehow during this whole struggle of him strangling her
4957000	4962000	that somehow the remote flew into the TV?
4962000	4965000	You guys are sick, sick people.
4965000	4967000	And it pains me to be associated.
4967000	4969000	They fought over fucking cookies.
4969000	4970000	They kind of...
4970000	4971000	Did you think that was serious?
4971000	4974000	At least there were no tacos thrown.
4974000	4977000	People have been trying to kill each other with game controllers for years.
4977000	4979000	I don't know if you know this.
4979000	4981000	It dates back to the 2600 days.
4981000	4984000	Back when we had the NES advantage, I could see someone getting killed with an NES advantage.
4984000	4989000	He's got a scar on his back in the shape of a ColecoVision controller.
4989000	4996000	Then there was this one time that I woke up and Jamie was just stuffing a power pad down onto my face.
4996000	4997000	She's been trying to kill me with a game controller.
4997000	5000000	Now she knows. Use a Wii remote. I'm dead.
5000000	5002000	You fuckers have killed me.
5002000	5006000	SSJ100Matt in our chat room has a great idea for a new video game.
5006000	5011000	Cookie Guy versus Taco Kid.
5011000	5018000	Dark Knight asks, does Miyamoto have to choke a bitch?
5018000	5020000	Oh boy.
5020000	5025000	We need to get to the classic game of the week and take a break and try to find our souls.
5025000	5027000	So every week here on Orange Lawn's radio,
5027000	5030000	DarkSakura likes to dig through the archive of great gaming
5030000	5033000	and find a video game she believes all of you should be playing.
5033000	5034000	It's our classic video game of the week.
5034000	5037000	DarkSakura, which should the kids be playing this week?
5037000	5039000	GORF.
5039000	5040000	Bless you.
5040000	5043000	Well, I didn't throw up yet.
5043000	5045000	GORF.
5045000	5050000	GORF stands for Galactic Orbiting Robot Force.
5050000	5057000	It's a very bizarre little game because it's like a version of three games in one.
5057000	5062000	Basically, your first level, you've got different missions.
5062000	5065000	So going through different missions will set up your rank.
5065000	5072000	Anyway, I guess what you're hearing, it's just about shooting.
5072000	5075000	It's basically Space Invaders. The first stage of GORF is Space Invaders.
5075000	5081000	The first level is Space Invaders with a big circular shield that you kind of have to shoot through.
5081000	5091000	Yeah, the second level is, well, like my husband was saying, behind the scenes,
5091000	5095000	is like Galaga where you have to shoot the little planes that shoot down.
5095000	5098000	It had the crappiest collision detection ever.
5098000	5101000	It wouldn't even shoot you and you'd explode.
5101000	5104000	Stupid game.
5104000	5114000	And then the last level was another, well, at least in the arcade version,
5114000	5120000	you had the Galaxian-type level and you had a space warp-type level after that,
5120000	5129000	which was the gyrus-like level where it's sort of a weird perspective as if you're going into the warp.
5129000	5134000	All kind of tempest-y, but not quite, as far as the perspective.
5134000	5139000	And then the last one is the flagship one where actually you're going and shooting the alien ship
5139000	5144000	and it has a shield around it, like a semi-circular shield, so you have to shoot through it.
5144000	5147000	And the game was actually supposed to be a tie-in with Star Trek The Motion Picture,
5147000	5151000	but it didn't fit in with the script, so they said no.
5151000	5155000	So they put all these great 80s space games in a blender and out comes GORF.
5155000	5167000	Pretty much. On top of that, it was actually saying here that it used the Votrax speech synthesis chip in the arcade version,
5167000	5170000	so it had the robot voice in it too. It was pretty cool.
5170000	5174000	I only played this in the arcade a couple times. I had this on the Colecovision,
5174000	5178000	which to me is just the best version of GORF ever.
5178000	5181000	I love the little music place.
5181000	5190000	But it's also saying that the GORF hardware actually was compatible,
5190000	5194000	and you could switch it out for other games like Wizard of War.
5194000	5196000	I'm going to do something here with the music.
5196000	5199000	I'm going to switch to the Commodore 64 version just because I love Commodore 64
5199000	5201000	and I see that there's one here on this.
5201000	5205000	But GORF was out on like a million different systems, it seems. Right?
5205000	5213000	Yeah, it was out on quite a few.
5213000	5216000	I think I played this on Commodore 64. This looks familiar to me.
5216000	5219000	I remember the circular shield and all that stuff. Good times.
5219000	5225000	But basically though, as you go through the levels and get to the end of it,
5225000	5228000	and I've gotten to the end of it on the Colecovision,
5228000	5239000	you get space cadet, space captain, space colonel, space general, space warrior, and space avenger.
5239000	5244000	There was a sequel planned called Ms. GORF. Yeah, I know.
5244000	5248000	Does Ms. GORF have a bow in her hair? Is that what differentiates her from GORF?
5248000	5252000	I don't know.
5252000	5258000	It was actually, I think it was programmed in fourth language.
5258000	5260000	Is that like fourth meal at Taco Bell?
5260000	5266000	Well, the programmer of GORF owns the source code
5266000	5271000	and it apparently only exists in a set of eight inch floppy disks.
5271000	5276000	There were versions on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Colecovision,
5276000	5282000	the Atari 8-bit BBC Micro, Commodore 64, VIC-20, and 1982.
5282000	5287000	The Galaxian mission was removed from all home ports.
5287000	5293000	It was given an Atari Jaguar port just by some guy.
5293000	5295000	You know, did it as a hobby.
5295000	5300000	And it was taken off of the market because he didn't go for any of the copyrights.
5300000	5302000	So, bastard.
5302000	5304000	I'm bored. I think I want to remake GORF.
5304000	5306000	I know, right?
5306000	5313000	Also, the current world record for GORF, recognized by Twin Galaxies.
5313000	5316000	And the...
5316000	5320000	Hey, I watch King of Kong.
5320000	5324000	I actually realized a giant fart was enough to make the high scoreboard on GORF.
5324000	5328000	Here, let me make the scoreboard right now.
5328000	5330000	As Rob puts the microphone towards his crotch.
5330000	5334000	Anyway, he also made the Guinness Book of World Records
5334000	5341000	by a guy named Todd Rogers on November 24th, 1982 at Haunted Trails in Burbank, Illinois.
5341000	5343000	He is?
5343000	5346000	Oh, apparently he's in the King of Kong.
5346000	5348000	And my husband says he looks like Ron Jeremy.
5348000	5349000	Kind of.
5349000	5352000	With the Rob D's in chat going, I hate Todd Rogers.
5352000	5354000	I know it's Todd Rogers. I hate him.
5354000	5359000	But the high score was 653,990.
5359000	5363000	I want someone to break it.
5363000	5365000	That would involve playing GORF.
5365000	5367000	GORF is fun.
5367000	5375000	I am putting out a personal challenge to someone to break Todd Rogers' score on GORF.
5375000	5379000	653,990.
5379000	5381000	GORF backwards is frog.
5381000	5386000	It would actually be pretty awesome if you could break it with a score of 666,000.
5386000	5394000	If someone, whoever manages to break that will get a no prize from me,
5394000	5398000	will be interviewed on Orange Town's radio,
5398000	5404000	and will win a shiny penny.
5404000	5406000	You also get it in the Guinness Book of World Records, though.
5406000	5407000	You might.
5407000	5408000	Alright, look.
5408000	5409000	Enough GORF.
5409000	5410000	Frog.
5410000	5411000	No, good choice.
5411000	5414000	It's definitely a game I think a lot of people have not heard of or forgot about.
5414000	5418000	So bringing GORF back to the spotlight, and hopefully that old record can be shattered.
5418000	5421000	How about a little anecdote regarding me picking that game?
5421000	5422000	Sure.
5422000	5426000	I was actually trying to think of a good epic RPG, and I was like, ah, fuck it, GORF.
5426000	5429000	Whatever works for you.
5429000	5430000	Whatever works.
5430000	5431000	It just stuck in my head.
5431000	5432000	Alright.
5432000	5435000	Anyhow, we're going to take a break while Dan and Jamie get into an argument.
5435000	5436000	We're going to take a break.
5436000	5439000	Everything she knows about classic video games she stole from me.
5439000	5441000	And then she flipped me off.
5441000	5443000	Right on the air.
5443000	5444000	We're going to take a break, you guys.
5444000	5446000	We'll be back with plenty more Orange Lounge Radio.
5446000	5447000	We have more to come in Part B tonight.
5447000	5451000	We're going to talk about Indiana Jones and a great Indiana Jones game that might be making
5451000	5452000	a comeback.
5452000	5455000	We're going to finally talk about iPhone gaming, which I promised Dan we could do earlier.
5455000	5458000	And a new project from Rockstar Games, which I'm sure has Loki pretty excited.
5458000	5462000	We'll be talking about all of that in Part B right after this.
5462000	5471000	Stay tuned, guys, with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5471000	5475000	Welcome, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the
5475000	5481000	8th of 2009, where we are doing the 312th episode of our show, Orange Lounge Radio.
5481000	5483000	We always tape live Sunday nights at AllGames.com.
5483000	5487000	Of course, if you were listening live tonight, there was a little bit of mad stuff going
5487000	5488000	on during the break.
5488000	5489000	We've kind of been joking throughout the evening.
5489000	5492000	There's a lot of wind and rain type stuff going on outside.
5492000	5494000	It seemed to have knocked our network out for a little bit because we dropped during
5494000	5495000	the break.
5495000	5498000	Our podcast listeners won't notice a thing because they just get that little break in
5498000	5499000	between there.
5499000	5503000	But we're going to get right back on with the show, so I apologize for running a little
5503000	5504000	late.
5504000	5505000	We're going to try and catch up some time here.
5505000	5508000	And I know we have folks that want to call in to talk about New York Comic-Con and all
5508000	5509000	that stuff.
5509000	5512000	So we're going to try and move a little bit quickly through news in Part B. We'll see.
5512000	5513000	I had the small announcement, though.
5513000	5515000	Oh, yes, you did have a small announcement, Dark Soccer.
5515000	5522000	I just got this inspiration during the last segment on Part A. I kind of want to do a
5522000	5525000	monthly top score contest on a classic game.
5525000	5528000	And I know not everyone has different things, so I'll pick different consoles and arcade
5528000	5529000	or whatnot.
5529000	5535000	But I will be putting something up very soon for a high score classic game contest.
5535000	5537000	And talk to our web guy about that.
5537000	5540000	Because with the new website and everything, there's now a thing where you can upload pictures
5540000	5544000	directly to our website by sending it this particular email address so people can send
5544000	5545000	their scores.
5545000	5547000	Maybe we can do a little widget or something with the scores.
5547000	5549000	We could probably put something together pretty easy.
5549000	5550000	It would be fun.
5550000	5551000	I'm still working on it.
5551000	5558000	But, you know, I used to do the game knowledge quiz back when I had Pump Up the Volume.
5558000	5560000	And I'd kind of like to do something like that again.
5560000	5561000	That'd be fun.
5561000	5562000	Yeah.
5562000	5563000	All right.
5563000	5564000	Well, anyhow, let's get into some news now.
5564000	5566000	And we'll start off with Loki.
5566000	5569000	He's bringing us some news on an old classic series, right?
5569000	5573000	Yes, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings was the new Indiana Jones game that they announced
5573000	5575000	for the Wii and DS.
5575000	5578000	And, you know, it actually looks pretty cool.
5578000	5581000	I'm glad to see that LucasArts is working on an Indiana Jones game.
5581000	5587000	But something that's also pretty cool is they're going to be bringing a special unlockable
5587000	5589000	for the Wii version.
5589000	5595000	It will have the adventure game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.
5595000	5596000	Sorry.
5596000	5598000	You didn't hear that music on the feed.
5598000	5599000	My bad.
5599000	5603000	So, yeah, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis on the Wii version.
5603000	5609000	Pretty good if you don't have, you know, a SCUMM emulator on there.
5609000	5610000	Or SCUMM VM.
5610000	5615000	And this is like one of the all-time classic, you know, click and point games.
5615000	5617000	So it's pretty awesome.
5617000	5621000	Are they not doing that 360 and PS3 one that they announced?
5621000	5623000	Maybe not right now.
5623000	5624000	It might be later on.
5624000	5626000	Weak.
5626000	5628000	Well, this is also on the Wii.
5628000	5630000	So maybe just, you know, multi-platform?
5630000	5636000	Everything but, yeah, Wii, PlayStation 2, and PSP.
5636000	5638000	Because, you know, they can port that crap easy.
5638000	5641000	So, I don't know.
5641000	5644000	There may be another one coming out for the PS3 and 360.
5644000	5647000	They're still working on it, so.
5647000	5650000	Well, I don't know if you would file this under Wiimageddon or what you'd do,
5650000	5652000	but apparently EA, they made a lot of announcements this week
5652000	5655000	because they had a financial call going on this week.
5655000	5659000	And apparently they are going to be porting Dead Space to the Wii.
5659000	5663000	This says, a quote from the call, the CEO John Riccitello says,
5663000	5666000	We're bringing core intellectual properties and franchises
5666000	5668000	in categories we think have legs on the Wii platform.
5668000	5671000	A good example of this is Dead Space.
5671000	5675000	Unfortunately, what you don't know is that it's going to be Dead Space Party.
5675000	5678000	And it's actually going to be, you know, Party Spinoff
5678000	5683000	because, you know, they couldn't really do an actual legit hardcore game for the Wii.
5683000	5685000	Well, I don't know.
5685000	5687000	But the interesting thing about this is that they actually say,
5687000	5689000	and also this from a magazine interview, quote,
5689000	5692000	Go look at Dead Space and imagine playing that game with a wand and nunchuck.
5692000	5695000	If they improved the precision, then you could have a good experience.
5695000	5699000	Hmm, is it a hint that MotionPlus could be supported by this?
5699000	5702000	And imagine that the graphics look slightly worse.
5702000	5704000	Slightly.
5704000	5706000	It's like this.
5706000	5710000	If EA pulls this off, and they're a company on the upswing,
5710000	5714000	I mean, I know that profits are down and they're laying people off,
5714000	5717000	but creatively, wow, that's a great word,
5717000	5719000	you've got to give EA credit.
5719000	5722000	They're head and shoulders above where they were last year this time, you know.
5722000	5725000	They're coming off of Dead Space, which was amazing.
5725000	5727000	Mirror's Edge, which was a heck of a game.
5727000	5729000	Just a bunch of great titles coming out of EA.
5729000	5733000	If they pull this off, props.
5733000	5737000	I mean, because the Wii needs super cool games,
5737000	5741000	but man, I don't know how you're going to do it without the graphic power
5741000	5744000	because Dead Space is a game where the visuals are just so important.
5744000	5748000	Well, okay, granted, if Dead Space really is about the graphics,
5748000	5751000	then, you know, whatever, but should games really be about the graphics?
5751000	5752000	Not necessarily, right?
5752000	5755000	Well, maybe, maybe not, but I mean, play Dead Space.
5755000	5757000	I mean, have you played Dead Space?
5757000	5759000	No, because it's first person.
5759000	5761000	That game will fuck you up for life.
5761000	5763000	I'll check it out, but I just know not yet.
5763000	5767000	It's atrocious, and I think so much of the atmosphere in that game
5767000	5770000	is it's just super, super good visuals.
5770000	5772000	But I will say, one of the other games you mentioned,
5772000	5774000	I'm not usually much of a first person gamer,
5774000	5776000	but Mirror's Edge is pretty hot.
5776000	5777000	I think that game is pretty hot.
5777000	5779000	Yeah, and it's one of those things where it's like if they tried to do that on Wii,
5779000	5782000	and they could do it right and have motion controls and stuff,
5782000	5784000	hey, you know, great, more power to you.
5784000	5788000	The Wii needs these games, you know, even if it's not about graphics,
5788000	5792000	which it's not about graphics, if they could bring this game
5792000	5796000	in a meaningful way to the other system, to the Wii,
5796000	5799000	it would validate the Wii's existence
5799000	5801000	because there are too many minigame collections.
5801000	5806000	And don't get me wrong, I know for the Wii's mainstream target audience,
5806000	5808000	that's, I guess, what sells.
5808000	5811000	But, you know, they need it.
5811000	5814000	Again, if you're just joining us live tonight here on All Games Radio,
5814000	5816000	Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games,
5816000	5819000	I just want to point out that's Dan, Jamie's husband,
5819000	5821000	often talked about on the show but rarely heard from.
5821000	5825000	But he's here tonight and telling it like it is from his experience
5825000	5828000	in working in game stores for many years.
5828000	5834000	Well, in other gaming news, especially in iPhone gaming news,
5834000	5837000	which, you know, as a person who has an iPhone
5837000	5840000	and actually plays the games on it,
5840000	5842000	I still don't know what I think about having this one on there
5842000	5844000	because it just seems like it would be cheaply easy.
5844000	5851000	But Time Crisis is supposed to be coming on to the Apple App Store,
5851000	5856000	actually already on there, where you can play with the finger of death.
5856000	5859000	Instead of shooting the guys on the screen, you tap them,
5859000	5862000	so I guess it's like punching them in the face with a gun.
5862000	5868000	And the way that you dodge is by tilting the iPhone to do your dodge move,
5868000	5870000	which I suppose is also reload.
5870000	5873000	So you can now poke people to death.
5873000	5877000	Very interesting, though, at this rise of, you know,
5877000	5881000	console gaming franchise classics coming on to iPhone.
5881000	5884000	And I don't know if it's just because it's kind of like all Namco and Konami,
5884000	5887000	but, you know, just within the past, like just within 2009,
5887000	5893000	we've had news of Katamari, Time Crisis, Silent Hill, Metal Gear,
5893000	5896000	DDR, all having, yeah, there's a Silent Hill iPhone game now.
5896000	5898000	Oh, you weren't here last week.
5898000	5901000	I have it, if you want to check it out before you buy it and spend $7 on it.
5901000	5903000	But there's, yeah, Silent Hill iPhone game now.
5903000	5904000	Don't do it.
5904000	5908000	It's not fog, it's not fog adventure Silent Hill.
5908000	5911000	It's like a dungeon explorer type thing, so just, you know, try before you buy.
5911000	5912000	That's what I'm saying.
5912000	5914000	But, yeah, there's a Silent Hill game on iPhone now.
5914000	5916000	It's crazy.
5916000	5921000	So it's just interesting, this whole, you know, barrage of stuff we're getting.
5921000	5924000	I don't think the Metal Gear Solid game's out yet, but we know it's coming.
5924000	5925000	It is in the works, at least.
5925000	5926000	Oh, geez.
5926000	5928000	Metal Gear.
5928000	5931000	It's just interesting, I suppose.
5931000	5934000	Well, you know, I was going to say another game we didn't talk about
5934000	5937000	because it wasn't our show role, but Rolando.
5937000	5939000	I don't know if you remember that game.
5939000	5940000	Oh, yeah.
5940000	5941000	That's a great game.
5941000	5944000	They're doing a sequel to that, actually, on there.
5944000	5947000	And they have, I think, they're doing a free version, you know,
5947000	5949000	like a trial version or something like that.
5949000	5952000	So that's going to be available now, but, I mean, that's a pretty cool game.
5952000	5954000	I completely forgot to mention this during my gaming week
5954000	5957000	because I sometimes forget that my iPhone has become a way for me to do gaming,
5957000	5962000	but Aurora Faint 2, the arena, I checked out and downloaded a solid,
5962000	5964000	solid fucking game.
5964000	5966000	Who made Rolando?
5966000	5967000	That I don't know.
5967000	5968000	No idea.
5968000	5971000	Aurora Faint is a hell of a puzzle game that I'm enjoying on an iPhone.
5971000	5972000	It's LocoRoco.
5972000	5973000	Yeah.
5973000	5974000	It's great.
5974000	5975000	It is LocoRoco.
5975000	5976000	That's crazy.
5976000	5982000	But one thing that you won't find anymore on the iPhone app store
5982000	5984000	is the iPhone Duck Hunt game.
5984000	5988000	Yes, the Nintendo lawyers have finally swooped in like a duck
5988000	5992000	and plucked the game off the...
5992000	5994000	Anything about the game in Watch?
5994000	5996000	And then the dog rose out of the bushes and laughed at him.
5996000	6000000	You know the Nintendo lawyer, after he laid the smack down on that stupid little company,
6000000	6004000	did the Nintendo duck laugh.
6004000	6006000	What about the Game & Watch games, though, that were on there?
6006000	6007000	I don't know.
6007000	6008000	Those may still be on there.
6008000	6010000	I downloaded a couple of them.
6010000	6013000	Yeah, I downloaded the one that was free, but I didn't download any of the others.
6013000	6017000	Reggie's going to show up at your house and personally lead them off your iPhone.
6017000	6020000	He's going to Falcon Punch us with his cock.
6020000	6021000	Show me your move.
6021000	6023000	I did want to give a quick shout-out real quickly,
6023000	6027000	because we were talking about iPhone games and Namco and all their franchises.
6027000	6029000	Not on the iPhone, but on the PlayStation 3.
6029000	6033000	I believe a Namco collection is being released or has just recently been released,
6033000	6036000	and I hear it's pretty cool, and you want to check it out.
6036000	6037000	The Namco Museum on PS3.
6037000	6040000	I think it's only in the Japanese store.
6040000	6042000	Remember, because they were tying those in also,
6042000	6044000	you can get like t-shirts and shit for home.
6044000	6046000	I think it's going to be on its way here pretty soon.
6046000	6048000	I hear you want to check it out.
6048000	6051000	I didn't come out for the 360 like last Christmas.
6051000	6057000	Well, they had the Namco. It was a Namco arcade something for the 360.
6057000	6061000	They had like a bunch of the Xbox Live Arcade games,
6061000	6065000	and then they had some other classic games and remade stuff,
6065000	6067000	and that was supposed to be pretty good, and I think it's probably pretty cheap now.
6067000	6071000	Yeah, it had some live. It was like 30 bucks, and it had like 30 games or so.
6071000	6075000	I mean, it was this really weird thing because it had games you could play off the disk,
6075000	6080000	then it had games you had to import on your hard drive and play as like live arcade games.
6080000	6084000	You know, and it had like a lot of stuff you might have already downloaded.
6084000	6089000	It had like Pac-Man Tournament Edition and stuff like that, or Championship Edition.
6089000	6092000	Yeah, it looked like a great collection. Really cool stuff.
6092000	6095000	I was really surprised they did it because I figured they'd just keep, you know,
6095000	6099000	shelling them out to us 10 bucks at a time over the network.
6099000	6102000	All right, well, we're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute.
6102000	6105000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com with your emails,
6105000	6107000	but I have one more story about iPhone gaming,
6107000	6109000	and this ties in kind of exactly what you were saying a little bit ago,
6109000	6114000	and this is iPhone is growing and growing and starting to become mobile gaming.
6114000	6121000	In fact, right now, they are saying that iPhones are accounting for 14% of mobile game downloaders,
6121000	6125000	and that was in the month of November. 32.4%.
6125000	6129000	That's like a third of all iPhone users say that they have downloaded a game.
6129000	6131000	In the month of November, they downloaded some type of game.
6131000	6138000	Just to put that in perspective, across most mobile phone companies, you're looking at 3.8%.
6138000	6144000	So, you're talking like 10 times as many people on the iPhone check out games.
6144000	6146000	Is that because the iPhone gives you?
6146000	6148000	Go back a year on this show.
6148000	6152000	Just go back one year on this show before iPhone apps started coming out.
6152000	6156000	Mobile phone gaming was kind of the butt of many jokes on this show.
6156000	6160000	But in other countries, mobile gaming has been just fantastic,
6160000	6166000	but we haven't had a phone until the iPhone or the Trio or the ones like that came out
6166000	6172000	that was capable of handling an actual game with solid gameplay.
6172000	6174000	And let me say this to the chatters.
6174000	6177000	chat.orangelandradio.com, we always look at that here on Sunday Nights.
6177000	6180000	Catacos in the chat room says, well, let's get serious.
6180000	6182000	What other phone can play games on them that are that good?
6182000	6184000	Might I mention the N-Gage?
6184000	6187000	No, good. That are good.
6187000	6191000	The iPhone, you know, it amounts to like 3%, 30%, whatever, of games downloaded,
6191000	6196000	but it amounts to 100% of the decent phone games to download.
6196000	6200000	I will say this, that I did have a couple of cool games on my old phone.
6200000	6204000	It was intensely hard to play, but I did have Super Pac-Man.
6204000	6208000	Once in a while, there were even, as hard of a time as we gave them in the past,
6208000	6213000	there were, like, the Luminous one that they had on phones was pretty frickin' good for a phone game.
6213000	6219000	And the Doom RPG and stuff, they had some pretty intricate stuff even on the old-ass phones.
6219000	6222000	I did play Bejeweled on my old phone.
6222000	6227000	So, you know, but most of it was a joke because it was cashing in on the SpongeBob, you know, and all that crap.
6227000	6229000	You know, they were just crappy little games.
6229000	6235000	Spikaru says, I have an N-Gage and does NES and Mega Drive emulation pretty well.
6235000	6237000	That's the only thing it's good for.
6237000	6239000	I guess that would be a reason to have it.
6239000	6241000	Tony Hawk on N-Gage was not that bad.
6241000	6244000	All right. Let's get to the mailbag here, guys.
6244000	6247000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have questions for us.
6247000	6251000	Every week you guys send in your e-mails and we like to open up the mailbag and read through them.
6251000	6253000	And Dark Soccer's going to do it right now.
6257000	6259000	Do we actually get some e-mails this week?
6259000	6260000	Yes, we did.
6260000	6261000	All right.
6261000	6264000	We had a poor showing last week, so I'm glad people listened.
6264000	6269000	Rob with Two Bees says there's new box art on Neo GAF.
6269000	6271000	What's Neo GAF? G-A-F?
6271000	6273000	Neo games are fun.
6273000	6276000	Yeah, these huge forums that, you know, tons and tons of people look at.
6276000	6278000	Okay, I just haven't been there before.
6278000	6281000	Probably because there's like a million different gaming forums on the internet.
6281000	6287000	Supposedly the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame is being ported to PS3, Xbox 360.
6287000	6288000	Yes, it is.
6288000	6292000	He says I actually bought this for PSP, Wii, and PS2.
6292000	6294000	I'm curious to see the graphics.
6294000	6297000	I'm curious to see if they add some more tables.
6297000	6298000	The Wii, you know what?
6298000	6301000	Oh, God! Fun House is on the freaking cover. I hate that game.
6301000	6305000	Call Wii Mageddon as much as you want, but that Wii game was pretty awesome.
6305000	6307000	The pinballs. Dan's giving his thumbs up of approval.
6307000	6310000	Yeah, that was a pretty awesome collection of games, I gotta say.
6310000	6314000	If you like pinball, you have a 360, download Pinball FX.
6314000	6315000	It's awesome.
6315000	6317000	But Pinball Hall of Fame is great.
6317000	6322000	If they go crazy, add some new tables for the 360 PS3 versions, that'll be awesome.
6322000	6326000	It's actually a really good pinball collection, really good physics.
6326000	6331000	And honestly enough, my vote's for the Wii version because of the nunchucks for remote control.
6331000	6337000	Um, our next one, um, comes from GeekBoy2424.
6337000	6341000	Hi guys, I have come to a conclusion. I have ADHD.
6341000	6345000	Along with a little bit of OCD.
6345000	6352000	My question for the week is, how do you guys stop yourselves because the only thing that works for me is playing games?
6352000	6360000	Uh, when is, okay, I guess when I sit at my desk I can't concentrate because I can't sit freaking still.
6360000	6363000	Help Dr. Orange Lounge. Sincerely, GeekBoy2424.
6363000	6370000	Okay, well if you seriously think you might have some type of, like, you know, attention deficit disorder, you might want to see a doctor.
6370000	6375000	You know, as much as, you know, it strokes our gaming egos that you would email the show to talk about this,
6375000	6378000	you really, really need to see a doctor if you think you actually have symptoms.
6378000	6383000	Like, I don't know if this is a joke, because I joke a lot of times on the show that I have gaming ADHD
6383000	6386000	because I play a game for five minutes, then go, ooh, something shiny!
6386000	6389000	And go play something else. Like, it happens all the time.
6389000	6394000	But if, like, you're for real real, like, you have to play video games to get around your ADD that you think you have,
6394000	6397000	you might want to see a doctor. I'm just saying, we can't diagnose that.
6397000	6399000	And that's a huge liability if we even tried to.
6399000	6403000	Now that Rob has said something responsible, I say self-medicate.
6403000	6409000	Play games all the time. Just, it's not going to kill you or anything. Just play them.
6409000	6411000	When you're at your desk, what about your Game Boy?
6411000	6417000	You know, if it calms you down and it makes you feel good, it's not like you're doing drugs or something, hook it up, man.
6417000	6419000	Just remember to go to the bathroom once in a while.
6419000	6425000	When I was a young, hyperactive child, they used to make me drink coffee to calm down.
6425000	6433000	Because caffeine and, excuse me, caffeine, when you're already wired up and hyper, actually can be a sedative.
6433000	6440000	What? I'm not giving medical advice. I'm just saying what I used to do.
6440000	6441000	I'm just saying coffee's delicious.
6441000	6445000	That's not medical advice, by the way. That's just what I used to do.
6445000	6451000	Liability, liability, liability. No, I understand.
6451000	6458000	Anyway, but you know what? ADD is in your head.
6458000	6460000	I'm kidding.
6460000	6464000	Next email.
6464000	6473000	Hi, OLR. I'm sending this message from my iPod Touch with a cracked screen because my smart self dropped it on the ground while going from a friend's house to mine.
6473000	6481000	Anyway, I came to say hi because I've been listening to the podcast lately and laughed about the kid that threw a taco at his mom.
6481000	6484000	By P.S.
6484000	6487000	Oh, he didn't put any spaces or anything.
6487000	6494000	This message came from your friendly neighborhood MySpace friend, Eroka7, sent from my iPod.
6494000	6495000	The end.
6495000	6500000	Can I interrupt? I got some kind of sad news I want to read.
6500000	6508000	I just was informed of this by a chatter who linked me to an article on Bamani style that was posted earlier today.
6508000	6517000	Jason Michael Bornstein, who is kind of known more out there as Stillwind in his name, passed away on Saturday night.
6517000	6525000	He was a big part of the team at Konami of Hawaii, and he was the audio director of the Xbox series.
6525000	6533000	And part of the reason why I'm stopping the whole show to mention this and just kind of take a minute to kind of soak this all in is that
6533000	6540000	I don't know if you guys remember back when we would do the podcast and the show itself, the radio show itself, as separate shows,
6540000	6546000	but one year we had a big, big score that we had the universe soundtrack.
6546000	6552000	We premiered those songs here on Orange Lawn's radio, and I think it was like UltraMix 4 at the time before anybody else got to hear them.
6552000	6559000	That was Stillwind who coordinated all that with us here over email and was a big part, I know, of the fan community as well.
6559000	6569000	So I'm just kind of, it does not, I'm just kind of shocked and saddened to hear it, and I'm sorry to depress everybody with this news,
6569000	6576000	but I'm just finding it out myself, and this is sometimes the problems that you have when you do a live radio show is that you get live news.
6576000	6584000	I don't know, you know, Babani Style is a pretty respectable site. I don't see why they would lie about something like this, and just no.
6584000	6594000	That would be very poor taste. So I'm pretty sure this is legit and very sad, and I don't know what else to say.
6594000	6600000	I'm very sorry to hear this for his family and everybody and for the community that will have really lost something with this.
6600000	6602000	That's really sad news.
6602000	6604000	So I'm very sorry to derail the mailbag with that sad news.
6604000	6606000	He died from a ruptured aorta.
6606000	6608000	Oh, that is very sad.
6608000	6620000	Okay, but he did a lot for the show a couple years ago and did keep in touch a little while here and there, so I just wanted to pass that news along.
6620000	6628000	Sorry, please tell me the next email has like a dick and fart joke or something to bring the humor back to the show, because I really just killed it right there.
6628000	6630000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
6630000	6639000	Well, hi folks. I just thought I'd throw in my proverbial two cents regarding the subject of rampant fanboyism that is often seen quite a lot on the net.
6639000	6654000	Personally, I think that no matter what systems one promotes or trashes fanboyism in any form just makes us gamers look like the mouth-breathing Cheetos dust encrusted inbred Neanderthals that non-gamers perceive us, and quite frankly, this kind of thing really needs to stop.
6654000	6657000	Big, long sentence. Wow.
6657000	6666000	Speaking as someone who has both the 360 and PS3, and a whole shit-ton of other systems from previous generations, I can honestly say the following.
6666000	6668000	There's no such thing as a perfect system.
6668000	6675000	Either there's a flaw in the hardware itself, or there's a feature service, or some other aspect that another system does better.
6675000	6682000	Additionally, just because a given game isn't on one system of choice, that doesn't mean it's a crap game.
6682000	6693000	Conversely, just because a game is exclusive to one's favorite system, that doesn't make the game the greatest thing since the invention of breast implants.
6693000	6699000	Simply put, each system has strengths as well as weaknesses, good games as well as total turds.
6699000	6703000	It helps to have multiple consoles so one has that much more options for gaming.
6703000	6704000	Amen to that.
6704000	6710000	Because you know what we always said on the show, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
6710000	6714000	That sums it up right there. And that's from Spaznator.
6714000	6717000	Dreamcast, yo.
6717000	6722000	Dude, Dreamcast is turning 10 this year, can you believe it? I was just thinking about that. That's crazy.
6722000	6725000	I remember standing in line on September 9th, 1999.
6725000	6734000	It's interesting though that we do have three very distinct consoles that are out there right now, and all of them have decent games on them, and all of them have some pretty crap games on them.
6734000	6737000	So you have two consoles and then you have the Wii.
6737000	6743000	But even the Wii, you know, the Wii's got for it, for a particular audience, it has games people want.
6743000	6747000	Soccer moms and families, it's got a ton of stuff that people want.
6747000	6759000	But the console war right now, and while it's not a war for first place because Nintendo's got that, the console war, the culture clash in gamers right now is PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360.
6759000	6766000	Just like last generation, GameCube was there, but it was really Xbox versus PS2.
6766000	6776000	And, I mean, I've been hitting the gaming forums for a long time, I don't just work in a game store, but I work in a game store because I'm a gamer.
6776000	6781000	And, you know, the fanboyism is always going to be there.
6781000	6784000	I own every system, and I mean every system.
6784000	6787000	They really do.
6787000	6790000	In our defense, we do not own a Jaguar.
6790000	6793000	I would if I found one.
6793000	6798000	But, hey dude, Tempest 2000 is sweet and aliens versus predators good.
6798000	6800000	Cybermorph is not too bad.
6800000	6805000	But, back on the subject of fanboyism, I always have my favorites.
6805000	6812000	You know, when it came down to Genesis versus Super Nintendo, I would argue Genesis for hours.
6812000	6816000	And my wife says Super Nintendo, they're both great, don't get me wrong, Genesis.
6816000	6820000	But, quit worrying about it.
6820000	6826000	You know, if you go onto a forum and you post about something on the 360, expect someone to say the PS3 is great.
6826000	6830000	But, isn't it, and BlackWolf is in chat and makes a great point here.
6830000	6833000	And, you know, the executives get into this shit too.
6833000	6839000	Sony says that the PS3 is a leader because the Wii doesn't exist to them, and they don't consider the 360 reliable.
6839000	6841000	So, they say that they win by default.
6841000	6846000	They win because they're all, we refuse to acknowledge our competition, therefore we are the victors.
6846000	6848000	We win because our system is made by Sony.
6848000	6850000	He's also not making that up.
6850000	6852000	They're also eating too much periwinkle.
6852000	6855000	He's paraphrasing, but he's not making that up, what are you saying?
6855000	6857000	And they're also eating too much burnt sienna.
6857000	6860000	We are the number one Sony system on the planet.
6860000	6864000	And that's fine. You know, the company is going to try to brainwash you anyway.
6864000	6867000	Sadly, no, the PlayStation 2 is.
6867000	6872000	No, that's true. And the PSP. But, pick the system that you like and fight for it.
6872000	6873000	What about the PlayStation 1?
6873000	6877000	Get on the forums and tell everyone who likes the other system that they are ass clowns.
6877000	6881000	That's right. I want to see more rap and feminism. Be into what you're doing.
6881000	6883000	Alright, Jamie's dying to read the last email, Jamie.
6883000	6885000	Dear Lord.
6885000	6887000	Last email.
6887000	6889000	You brought him. You brought him.
6889000	6891000	I know, I know, I know.
6891000	6893000	Dan, I love Dan.
6893000	6899000	I'll tell you one thing that Sony does win in, and this is absolutely, you can't really, I think, argue this.
6899000	6903000	If the systems were used for blunt force trauma, they definitely would win.
6903000	6907000	Because that system is heavy and quite solid.
6907000	6910000	360, it is pretty heavy, not quite as solid.
6910000	6913000	The Wii, well, that's not very bad. Or not very good.
6913000	6917000	You come after me with a PS3. I'll come after you with a 360 power supply.
6917000	6922000	And we'll see who gets who.
6922000	6923000	What?
6923000	6924000	Dan, please.
6924000	6933000	Okay, last email. At least Dan's rambling has mean I've gotten to eat more bread and get more crumbs in my cleavage.
6933000	6935000	Excuse me.
6935000	6940000	No. Are you done?
6940000	6942000	Okay, last email.
6942000	6947000	Hey, OLR. Love the show. I never miss an episode on the podcast feed.
6947000	6952000	It's tough for me to catch the live show because I live on the East Coast and have young twins.
6952000	6955000	I'm early to work on Monday morning, blah, blah, blah.
6955000	6959000	Basically, what I'm saying is that I have a tough time staying up as late as the show runs.
6959000	6963000	Oh, stop it with your sob story. No, I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding.
6963000	6971000	Also, I love the fact that you guys, in podcast form, help me through the monotonous parts of my office job.
6971000	6973000	Amen.
6973000	6976000	Lately, I've been sad that the feed has been so far behind.
6976000	6979000	Is there any way that you could update the feed more regularly?
6979000	6981000	I've been missing my OLR fix every week.
6981000	6985000	Yes, it got updated twice last week and will be updated twice this week and will be caught up.
6985000	6987000	We're slowly catching up.
6987000	6993000	Again, it's just the side thing of having two computers running this thing off of.
6993000	6996000	I just get far behind. I'm only one person.
6996000	6998000	We're almost there.
6998000	7004000	Regardless, I appreciate your efforts as an independent podcast and wish you many more great episodes, Boston OLR fan.
7004000	7007000	I hear that a lot that we help people through the work week.
7007000	7011000	I know it's kind of depressing when your three-hour show you relied on isn't there, so I'm trying, guys.
7011000	7014000	We'll get caught up. We're almost there.
7014000	7017000	So, great. Thanks for the emails, guys. Send us more.
7017000	7020000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7020000	7022000	I'm hijacking this mother.
7022000	7025000	Next week's mailbag. Did you love Dan? Did you hate Dan?
7025000	7027000	There you go.
7027000	7033000	It's good to get that out of the way next week because in two weeks it'll be all Street Fighter IV talk when it comes to Dan.
7033000	7034000	Word.
7034000	7037000	Loki, how about some more gaming news?
7037000	7046000	Yes, let's talk a little bit about Red Dead Redemption, the sequel to Red Dead Revolver, and it's going to be very awesome.
7046000	7053000	It's actually going to be using the Rage engine again, so very similar to what they did with Grand Theft Auto IV.
7053000	7063000	And, of course, they say that there's going to be the complete open world with strong plotlines in a massive, vibrant, rural environment.
7063000	7067000	And it's supposed to be coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360. No sort of time frame, though.
7067000	7070000	Is that one out of left field or what?
7070000	7072000	A little bit, yeah.
7072000	7079000	How about a new bully game? Somebody was just asking me about that the other night in a car ride about bully. How about a new bully game?
7079000	7082000	How about a new Warriors game? I'm sorry. The first Warriors game was awesome.
7082000	7084000	You get the Xbox Live one?
7084000	7086000	No, that's unacceptable. That's crap.
7086000	7089000	I'm sure another bully will happen.
7089000	7096000	Because it was good, and it sold. But, seriously, it's like, how many years ago was Red Dead Revolver?
7096000	7097000	Yeah, that's true.
7097000	7103000	That was like four years ago. So, I mean, you know, bullies still got two, three more years before we need a sequel for it.
7103000	7106000	But then remember when we got Excite Truck?
7106000	7108000	Excite Truck was, like, great.
7108000	7112000	Dude, I know Excite Truck was awesome, but I'm just saying, like, dude, how many years ago was Excite Bike?
7112000	7116000	I don't even see Excite Truck, and Excite Bike is even remotely similar.
7116000	7120000	The games play completely different, but they are kind of like, you know, they do.
7120000	7123000	It makes me happy that Nintendo used the prefix Excite again.
7123000	7124000	Because it did excite me.
7124000	7131000	For the third time. You got Excite Bike, Excite Bike 64, which is sweet, and if that's on a virtual console it should be,
7131000	7136000	and Excite Truck, which is actually the best driving game on the Wii, right there with Mario.
7136000	7138000	Now they need Excite Tank.
7138000	7139000	Oh, dude, sweet.
7139000	7142000	Because nothing excites me more than the thought of driving a tank.
7142000	7145000	Or actually, Excite Truck with, like, a battle mode would be pretty awesome.
7145000	7147000	Excite Humvee.
7147000	7150000	Or, hey, let's take it even better.
7150000	7156000	Instead of an Excite Bike, or Excite Truck sequel, just do another Excite Truck game, but, like, with Mario stuff.
7156000	7158000	Like, making it like a Mario Kart off-road racing game.
7158000	7160000	No! Shut up!
7160000	7163000	It doesn't need, we don't need, Mario's everywhere already.
7163000	7165000	Excite Truck 2.
7165000	7168000	It'll be very simple. Or just a new F-Zero, for God's sake.
7168000	7170000	You know what?
7170000	7172000	I'm sorry, yes, Star-Star?
7172000	7174000	Excite Jet Ski.
7174000	7180000	Isn't that in Wii Sports? Isn't the new Wii Sports, what do they call it, Wii Sport Resort or whatever it's called?
7180000	7181000	Yeah.
7181000	7182000	Doesn't that have a Jet Ski thing in it?
7182000	7183000	Yes, it does.
7183000	7184000	I think it does.
7184000	7186000	Wave Race 65.
7186000	7191000	SSJ100 Matt is flash-forwarding to E3 this year.
7191000	7194000	Nelly, that's Matt's wife, Nelly interviewing Reggie.
7194000	7199000	Why the fuck aren't you making Excite Truck 2?
7199000	7201000	I would totally...
7201000	7207000	Sad thing is, Nelly will have no idea who the hell Reggie is, so if that were to actually happen, it could.
7207000	7210000	GS68 suggested Excite Butt.
7210000	7212000	No, you can't drive a butt.
7212000	7214000	Alright, look.
7214000	7216000	How about Excite Obama?
7216000	7217000	Because, you know, Obama...
7217000	7219000	Obama is exciting.
7219000	7226000	Obama excited a lot of people with his inauguration, election and all that, and is showing up in video games, apparently.
7226000	7227000	Go figure.
7227000	7231000	And this is in Street Fighter Online, Mouse Generation.
7231000	7235000	This is not necessarily the same Street Fighter that you know and love over here.
7235000	7239000	You know, this is an online one that's been going on for quite some time.
7239000	7244000	Some Valentine's Day, they have some chocolate-covered avatars that are being released.
7244000	7251000	Okay, whatever, but what's more kind of thought-provoking is the fact that there's a new character,
7251000	7258000	and he bears a resemblance to a certain presidential figure very recently, and he's called...
7258000	7261000	By the way, the pack is called the Yes We Can Pack.
7261000	7265000	If that doesn't tell you anything, I don't know what to tell you.
7265000	7268000	And that's the most offensive version of Obama that I've ever seen.
7268000	7271000	It really is. That is very offensive.
7271000	7274000	But it's Japanese, so people go, it's cute.
7274000	7275000	I'll show you.
7275000	7277000	He has some serious buck teeth.
7277000	7279000	Dark skin, short hair, come on.
7279000	7282000	It's just the whole, you know, but it's just...
7282000	7285000	You know, I don't think anyone's going to truly be offended by it.
7285000	7287000	It's Obama and his chocolate hair.
7287000	7288000	That's interesting.
7288000	7291000	Is this Street Fighter Online? This isn't like a Capcom product.
7291000	7293000	If he's meeting a Bush, I'll download it.
7293000	7294000	I don't...
7294000	7296000	I pay money to see that shit.
7296000	7298000	Obama Punch!
7298000	7300000	Maybe if they put Sarah Palin in it, I don't know.
7300000	7303000	No, apparently, this is from a Japanese publisher.
7303000	7308000	The name of the publisher is Diletto, and they are co-owned by Capcom and Games Arena.
7308000	7311000	So this is like, this is like a Capcom thing.
7311000	7312000	This is like an official product.
7312000	7313000	Sorta.
7313000	7314000	But in another country.
7314000	7318000	Like, you know, in Japan, in Marvel Superheroes vs. Street Fighter, on the Saturn,
7318000	7323000	there was a character that they couldn't have anywhere else in the world,
7323000	7326000	because he was copyrighted, I guess.
7326000	7327000	Norimaro, right?
7327000	7329000	He was like a comedian.
7329000	7333000	Man, wouldn't it be sweet if there was a hidden American character and it was Obama?
7333000	7336000	What would be Obama's special power in this game?
7336000	7337000	We don't know.
7337000	7341000	Well, according to DJ Dark Knight in chat, a veto uppercut.
7343000	7346000	He would have all of Sagat's moves, so he'd immediately be god tier.
7346000	7349000	And I mean, he would just be like, veto, veto.
7349000	7351000	I just had this image of Sagat, but actually, as Dick Cheney,
7351000	7353000	like, in a special movie, waterboarding.
7353000	7354000	Nice.
7354000	7356000	Or shooting you with a gun, as Dick Cheney.
7356000	7360000	He would start off, like, in, gosh, which game was it where he was?
7360000	7361000	Where's Sagat?
7361000	7363000	Start off holding like Dan, and then he'd throw him aside,
7363000	7365000	but he'd start off and be like Bush.
7365000	7367000	Wasn't there, like, a guile move?
7367000	7370000	Like, it was a rumored guile move, they'd pull out a pistol or something
7370000	7372000	and, like, shoot somebody?
7372000	7374000	That was, like, an urban fucking legend.
7374000	7378000	Some kid at the arcade knew a kid who saw a kid pull out a gun.
7378000	7380000	But now with Dick Cheney.
7381000	7383000	Yeah, Dick Cheney.
7383000	7386000	But he'd only shoot his partner in the face.
7386000	7388000	Now, a hidden character in this, would this be,
7388000	7391000	would Hillary Clinton come out of the woodwork and, like,
7391000	7392000	mix some shit up with this?
7392000	7394000	I don't know what her special character is.
7394000	7396000	Or Sarah Palin might come out, who knows?
7396000	7398000	Ariel Wolf shooting right there.
7398000	7400000	Here's the thing, the chat room is quick to point out,
7400000	7403000	there is an Obama Japan.
7404000	7407000	There is an Obama Japan, according to chat,
7407000	7409000	and I did remember seeing that on TV when he won.
7409000	7413000	They were, you know, showing how excited they were in Japan and all that, so.
7413000	7415000	All right, anyhow, if you want to join the festivities,
7415000	7418000	chat.orangelandtrader.com, and I apologize to the folks on Justin TV
7418000	7421000	because I just clicked over there and I see, like, the chat is filling up there.
7421000	7425000	Like, you have Deathwishing says Excitebike64 is my favorite game on the N64.
7425000	7426000	It was a good game.
7426000	7430000	And sorry guys, it's just really hard for us to watch two chat rooms at the same time
7430000	7434000	and do a show, so sometimes Justin TV gets ignored, so I apologize.
7434000	7437000	But definitely join our main chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com
7437000	7439000	and we'll read more of your comments as we can.
7439000	7440000	All right.
7440000	7443000	Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news, shall we, Jimmy?
7443000	7445000	Yes.
7445000	7448000	If, God, the wind doesn't blow the garage door clear over, what?
7448000	7450000	It's like...
7450000	7451000	World of Warcraft!
7451000	7453000	God is Obama uppercutting the door.
7453000	7454000	What about WoW?
7454000	7456000	There's going to be some changes.
7456000	7462000	In the next World of Warcraft patch, we'll have some class changes, actually.
7462000	7463000	Again?
7463000	7469000	There is no more consumable ammunition for hunters.
7469000	7473000	A boost of protection spec paladins.
7473000	7474000	For real?
7474000	7476000	Like, you don't have to get arrows anymore or whatever?
7476000	7477000	That makes me happy.
7477000	7478000	That's strange.
7478000	7483000	Major improvements to the priest class, especially in group healing.
7483000	7486000	General buffs for rogues and shamans.
7486000	7494000	Efficiency improvements for warriors and warlocks, with penalty for warriors changing stances being much lighter.
7494000	7499000	Plus mana regeneration being reigned in across the board.
7499000	7500000	Sweet!
7500000	7502000	Somewhere an arms warrior is rejoicing.
7502000	7505000	You can actually find more information on it on WoW Insider.
7505000	7507000	They've got the specifics listed.
7507000	7515000	But basically, they're trying to just streamline all the classes, trying to bring all the tanking classes in line.
7515000	7518000	Level, basically just trying to balance the game.
7518000	7525000	And also make the boss fights more challenging by decreasing the mana regeneration.
7525000	7528000	The content has not gone into testing yet.
7528000	7532000	It should be going in before the release in the next couple of months.
7532000	7534000	So, keep your eyes out.
7534000	7537000	If any of our readers find out more, let us know.
7537000	7547000	Also, in patch 3.1, there will be a new raid dungeon called Ulduar, with an introduction of dual talent specializations.
7547000	7550000	Thank god! About fucking time.
7550000	7551000	That's the rumor.
7551000	7557000	Well, after the 3.0.8 patch where hunters got nerfed hardcore, I guess this is a sad consolation that,
7557000	7561000	oh, we'll no longer have to make you buy arrows ever again.
7561000	7566000	I guess that's the consolation that we get as hunters, or huntards, as I like to call myself.
7566000	7569000	It hurts my feelings that I understood some of that.
7569000	7572000	Matt2, do you think this will be enough to get me back to WoW?
7572000	7577000	Yes, short of me paying for your account again or whatever to do to get you playing back to the world of warcrack.
7577000	7580000	I actually kind of think that I want to start playing again just for a little bit.
7580000	7582000	Even though my last character was level 10.
7582000	7588000	But as Rob pointed out at the beginning of the show, all 20 of my characters, which is really 9 of them, are all Nar'zhul.
7588000	7590000	Have you been gone for more than 3 months?
7590000	7595000	Let me get you a scroll of resurrection because then we can get the uber item that lets us level up really quickly.
7595000	7597000	You'll get my scroll.
7597000	7599000	Stay strong. Don't start playing again.
7599000	7600000	No, no.
7600000	7601000	Just don't do it.
7601000	7605000	You're better off without it. It's like smoking. You just don't need that.
7605000	7608000	Yeah, but WoW doesn't cause cancer.
7608000	7610000	That's what you think.
7610000	7613000	Of course, our stigmatisms in our eyes might get worse and worse.
7613000	7616000	Dan thinks that it causes cancer to the sequel.
7616000	7619000	Is that cancer to electric boogaloo? What is this?
7619000	7621000	Whatever.
7621000	7625000	It's because it's not cool to say that things cause cancer because people are dying of cancer.
7625000	7628000	So I started saying that things cause cancer too.
7628000	7631000	Well, WoW causes electric boogaloo. It makes sense.
7631000	7634000	WoW causes electric boogaloo.
7634000	7636000	It's serious though. Don't start playing.
7636000	7638000	I don't know, but a new race engine...
7638000	7640000	You can be so much more about games when you don't play WoW.
7640000	7643000	That's true. I play so many more games when I'm not playing WoW.
7643000	7644000	You don't even know.
7644000	7645000	Satrombone.
7645000	7649000	Yes, satrombone. Low key.
7649000	7655000	Well, this is totally as far away from World of Warcraft as possible.
7655000	7663000	Battlefield 1943 is now slated to come out on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and Playstation Network this summer.
7663000	7670000	It is going to be based on the same engine as Bad Company and will feature 24 player battles.
7670000	7680000	And they had a few different maps, including Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima, which are based off of actual world locations.
7680000	7686000	I think they actually used some of the topography maps and stuff like that for that.
7686000	7689000	So, neat, I guess.
7689000	7698000	Also, around the same time, I believe they announced Battlefield Bad Company 2 as well.
7698000	7704000	Because really, if gaming needed anything besides more MMORPGs, it's more FPSs.
7704000	7706000	Thank God.
7706000	7712000	I think, if I remember correctly, Bad Company 2 is right now for September.
7712000	7718000	Now, TigerClaw says it's nice for them to go back to the World War 2 roots.
7718000	7725000	Since, obviously, they can't really do the modern warfare stuff now because Call of Duty has owned it.
7725000	7729000	I do want to go back previously because this comment is pretty funny on the past story about WoW.
7729000	7735000	Rama in chat says WoW may not cause cancer, but it can cause breakups, cheating, and marriage counseling.
7735000	7738000	I have heard that.
7738000	7741000	But the family that raids together stays together.
7741000	7744000	Alright, that's my counter-argument.
7744000	7747000	I am not going back to WoW.
7747000	7750000	I'm going to play Perfect World because I said I was going to play Perfect World.
7750000	7752000	For 30 days and you'll come play WoW.
7752000	7755000	I've been off of WoW for how long?
7755000	7757000	At it? And you're not even playing anymore?
7757000	7760000	I'm not even playing right now. Why am I trying to recruit people?
7760000	7764000	Alright, because I know Matt 2 is going to succeed in his efforts to try and get me back.
7764000	7766000	Yes, I am.
7766000	7769000	Anyhow, going back to EA.
7769000	7772000	I am, really.
7772000	7774000	And their conference call they had.
7774000	7778000	News about Battlefield was not the only thing to come out of it and some of the things we talked about in Part A.
7778000	7784000	But also Mass Effect has been confirmed that Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.
7784000	7786000	It's not going to be Xbox exclusive.
7786000	7788000	That's straight out of the mouth of CEO John Riccitello.
7788000	7790000	Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.
7790000	7797000	Also, Bad Company, the other Battlefield game, will be back on consoles in the year 2010.
7797000	7801000	So, some point like January to March, but who knows?
7801000	7806000	Really? I thought it was 2009, but I guess it's going to be delayed a lot more.
7806000	7808000	Probably even more than that.
7808000	7809000	What, Mass Effect?
7809000	7812000	No, the other one. The Battlefield Bad Company.
7812000	7816000	I thought Mass Effect was a Microsoft Game Studios owned franchise.
7816000	7818000	I didn't think Bioware carried it over with them.
7818000	7822000	Well, here's the thing, and I bet Black Wolf and Chad is right. He's saying it right.
7822000	7823000	He's saying exactly what I'm thinking.
7823000	7826000	Multiple platform equals Xbox 360 and PC.
7826000	7828000	I bet you that's exactly what it is.
7828000	7830000	Doesn't mean suddenly we're going to see PS3.
7830000	7833000	And plus, we've also seen, you know, who knows?
7833000	7836000	You might get a Mass Effect spinoff on the DS.
7836000	7841000	Because we have seen that Microsoft is not opposed to letting their stuff go on, yeah, less effect.
7841000	7844000	Dual effect.
7844000	7850000	Seeing things go on the DS, Viva Pinata had a game on the DS, so it's possible.
7850000	7852000	No, not Viva Pinata, Mech Assault.
7852000	7857000	That would be an awesome game, like a mech game, but they're just giant pinatas.
7857000	7861000	Well, they've done Mech Assault on the DS, and it was not very good.
7861000	7865000	But they did it. It was a Microsoft franchise.
7865000	7867000	They did it. It was a Microsoft franchise.
7867000	7869000	That's all I'm saying.
7869000	7877000	But I was a completely different game, but it's kind of big like some of these Mass Effect games and stuff.
7877000	7880000	Borderlands, I actually watched some gameplay footage of.
7880000	7883000	And that thing's going to be epic, and I think it's going to catch a lot of people off guard.
7883000	7892000	Because it's almost like Oblivion and Fallout with just a lot more fast-paced first-person gameplay and vehicles.
7892000	7896000	And Mad Max.
7896000	7897000	Alrighty then.
7897000	7903000	Well, let's move a little bit away from that world and go to a different kind of virtual world altogether.
7903000	7905000	The world of Sims.
7905000	7910000	I love The Sims, because I like building houses apparently, and then not doing anything.
7910000	7922000	Sims 3 actually has been talked about, but it's been delayed from the February 20th release date to sometime in early June.
7922000	7931000	They're actually speculating June 2nd, with the non-PC versions being sometime later than that.
7931000	7942000	They're also saying that the games will be released on PC and Mac and iPhone, iPhone Touch, and other mobiles.
7942000	7946000	But the release date only really goes for the PC version.
7946000	7949000	So, oh well.
7949000	7950000	Yeah, too bad.
7950000	7954000	Well, I mean, they're delaying a lot of stuff, so not surprised.
7954000	7955000	And you know what?
7955000	7956000	News of all these game delays.
7956000	7961000	I don't know about you guys, but I just get ticked off when I hear about all these game delays.
7961000	7966000	Because, you know, I get my hopes up to play these awesome sounding games, and then, aha, gotcha, delayed.
7966000	7974000	And, you know, when I get ticked off like this, we start playing the angry music, and it causes the angry segment of our show to happen called the FUs of the Week.
7974000	7990000	Music
7990000	7991000	FU.
7991000	7993000	Yes, this is the FUs of the Week.
7993000	7995000	The best part of the show.
7995000	8007000	FU to my work for deciding that I need to help back up people on the phones, even though I don't get a single damn call, and it'll really suck because I've been having a really bad sore throat from my sinus infection.
8007000	8013000	So, FU to the phones and talk to the people.
8013000	8026000	FU the person that parks next to me at my apartment complex because they're parking right on the line and they haven't moved their car in like four days, and so it makes it almost impossible for me to get out of my car.
8026000	8033000	I would really do some damage to their car, but someone's already keyed it, so apparently they do this other places as well, so.
8033000	8035000	Ah, fuck them.
8035000	8037000	I actually don't have a lot of FUs of the Week.
8037000	8040000	I had a pretty good week, so FU to me being so happy, I suppose.
8040000	8047000	But, um, FU to, I'll say this, FU to sleeping in until noon and still feeling tired.
8047000	8050000	I hate that. Have you ever had that where you sleep so freaking much?
8050000	8058000	Although that's not the case because I didn't go to bed until five last night, but I have had this happen before where, like, you sleep so much that your eyes hurt and you're still tired.
8058000	8061000	I've had that happen. That sucks. FU to that.
8061000	8064000	Okay, Dan, do you have any FUs of the Week you want to share?
8064000	8067000	FU to people who get bent about push release dates.
8067000	8076000	There's other shit to play. Find a different game. Seriously. Those dates don't even exist for you.
8076000	8081000	Those are for retailers, like me, so I know when they're coming out and I know when to start pushing the product.
8081000	8084000	You're not even supposed to know them! FU all.
8084000	8088000	Dan, we just have to work in this segment somewhere in the show, so just wait a second.
8088000	8093000	You die. You die twice. I hope you get electric boogaloo.
8093000	8095000	FU to being alive.
8095000	8098000	Matt, too! Do you have any FUs of the Week you'd like to share?
8098000	8107000	I haven't thought this far ahead, but I guess FU to Weemageddon, the potential impending Weemageddon that may cause more console wars with each other.
8107000	8111000	And the Jerry Breckenheimer movie that will follow called Weemageddon.
8111000	8114000	That's right. That's right. It'll make millions upon millions of dollars.
8114000	8120000	But I do agree that there are two main primary consoles in the Wii U for that one special demographic.
8120000	8123000	FU to you for stealing my stolen word.
8123000	8128000	FU, because you thought that first and I happened to say it.
8128000	8129000	It's not even copyright.
8129000	8132000	That's why I said I stole it, and then you stole it from me.
8132000	8133000	Alright, FU both.
8133000	8134000	And then you stole it from him.
8134000	8135000	FU both. We're getting back into the news.
8135000	8137000	Loki doesn't even want it anymore.
8137000	8140000	We'll add a prefix to FU. S-T-F-U.
8140000	8142000	Oh, snap.
8142000	8143000	Oooh.
8143000	8147000	Alright, Loki. Do we have any more gaming news? I hope so.
8147000	8156000	Yes. I was going to say, I'm going to now copyright Super Weemageddon.
8156000	8159000	The Super Weemageddon.
8159000	8167000	Well, a game that will not be featured on the Super Weemageddon 64 will be Puzzle Quest Galactrix.
8167000	8171000	Really? Because they do manage to port those Puzzle Quest games to everything.
8171000	8172000	It is sad.
8172000	8174000	It could be on Super Weemageddon 64 already.
8174000	8178000	It will be coming out on DSPC, Xbox Live Arcade.
8178000	8183000	Apparently the PC version is coming around on February 24th.
8183000	8189000	The Xbox Live Arcade date is unconfirmed, but you know me being the guessing man that I am.
8189000	8196000	I would say since the, I don't know, maybe probably the week after.
8196000	8201000	Puzzle Quest is cool. I was really afraid you were going to say it was cancelled.
8201000	8202000	It's cancelled.
8202000	8203000	No.
8203000	8205000	What? No Atari 2600 port?
8205000	8208000	It's cancelled for Christmas, and Christmas is cancelled as well.
8208000	8210000	Puzzle Quest is awesome.
8210000	8211000	Happy Hanukkah!
8211000	8213000	Although where the Galactrix thing comes from, I don't even know.
8213000	8218000	Galactrix comes from the fact that the game is different and it's set in space now.
8218000	8223000	And they changed the engine. Like, you know, now it's the whole hexagonal thing.
8223000	8227000	But it's pretty cool, actually. If you've played the demo, it's pretty addicting, I think.
8227000	8232000	Just put friggin' Puzzle Pirates on Xbox Live Arcade game.
8232000	8234000	Seriously. Seriously. Seriously.
8234000	8237000	It's really meant to be a portable game, though. I can't see sitting there.
8237000	8240000	Yeah, Puzzle Pirates would be an awesome DS, like, MMO.
8240000	8243000	I can't see playing, like, Puzzle Quest on my 360.
8243000	8247000	But I could totally see playing that on the PSP.
8247000	8254000	Also, out of EA, some other news. It's not related to Puzzle Quest, but one other little piece of news that's out of EA.
8254000	8259000	Apparently, they are now going to be getting the Bourne series over there.
8259000	8262000	Or, I guess what's going on, it's not just really the Bourne.
8262000	8266000	What's happened, they've picked up the rights to publish games that are based on Robert Ludlam stories.
8266000	8269000	He is the guy who made the Jason Bourne series.
8269000	8273000	So, apparently the first game in the series is going to be made by Star Breeze Studios.
8273000	8276000	No word on exactly what that game is, but...
8276000	8280000	Because the first game was so awesome that they really needed to make a sequel to it?
8280000	8285000	You know, I'm not surprised these games sell pretty well, though, because the Bourne series is kind of one of those series that...
8285000	8289000	You know, a lot of people don't talk about it, but a lot of people watch these movies.
8289000	8292000	You know, all of them broke 100 million at the box office.
8292000	8294000	Matt Damon!
8294000	8297000	They all do very well, yes, because of Matt Damon.
8300000	8304000	What other books has he written? I mean, I'm not really familiar with...
8304000	8306000	It is a Bourne title they're working on, by the way.
8306000	8309000	I'll start with The Bourne, and end with, like, something.
8309000	8311000	The Bourne Cakery.
8311000	8314000	Nice.
8314000	8317000	Okay. The Bourne Cooking Mama. No, I don't know.
8317000	8323000	So, there you have it. EA has picked up the Bourne rights, and who knows what else from the same author.
8323000	8326000	The Bourne Oven.
8326000	8330000	I like this idea of picking up rights to authors' stories, though.
8330000	8333000	Like, could you imagine, like, you know, J.D. Salinger rights getting picked up?
8333000	8334000	We'd have The Catcher in the Rye game.
8334000	8336000	Hey, we've had Discworld games before.
8336000	8341000	Roald Dahl gets picked up. We could finally have Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, the game.
8341000	8344000	It'd be pretty amazing.
8344000	8349000	It was certainly better than that shit-tastic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory game they put out a couple years ago.
8349000	8352000	I'm picking up the rights to the Bible.
8353000	8358000	Sorry, those little offshoot companies already did Bible adventures. Hello?
8360000	8363000	I don't know if, like, God's rights are for sale.
8363000	8366000	I pick the...
8369000	8371000	I'm so glad you didn't have a mic when you said that.
8371000	8377000	I pick the rights to the gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster game.
8378000	8381000	I am going to do a Flying Spaghetti Monster game.
8381000	8385000	Fine, I'm buying the rights to the articles in Playboy.
8385000	8393000	Seriously, if you want to make a badass game, license the Oblivion Engine and the Bible.
8393000	8397000	And just combine them. How fucking nuts would that be?
8397000	8401000	Or as Frisbee puts in the chat, SuperChristPuncher64.
8404000	8406000	Jesus, punch!
8406000	8409000	And if you die, you just get resurrected.
8409000	8412000	You don't really have to buy the rights to the Bible. I think it's in public domain.
8412000	8414000	So if you wanted to make that game, you could make it.
8414000	8416000	Then why do they sell Bibles on TV?
8416000	8418000	No, seriously, I'm selling the rights to the Bible.
8418000	8421000	If you want to buy a Bible, I'm your man.
8421000	8425000	Ray Bradbury, you go around burning books in, like, Fahrenheit 451. I can just see it now.
8425000	8428000	Please, more gaming news that isn't related to religion.
8428000	8430000	Flying Spaghetti Monster.
8431000	8434000	Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children.
8434000	8436000	I said not religion.
8437000	8440000	For some people, Final Fantasy VII is a religion.
8440000	8442000	These people need lives.
8442000	8452000	At any rate, the Blu-Ray edition of the movie will have a dub soundtrack.
8452000	8454000	Which is why I'm importing that bitch.
8454000	8459000	And not because Final Fantasy XIII demo is going to be on there at all.
8459000	8461000	Oh no, not for that or anything.
8461000	8465000	No, never for that. No, it's going to have an option.
8465000	8468000	I do want the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
8468000	8477000	But it actually, if you do buy that Blu-Ray version though, it's going to have the English voice track.
8477000	8482000	Did you download the HD Final Fantasy XIII trailer on PlayStation 3?
8482000	8484000	No.
8484000	8487000	I seriously think I got a boner from watching that trailer. It was pretty hot.
8487000	8489000	Noise.
8490000	8494000	I'm hearing way too much about cocks on this show tonight.
8494000	8497000	At least we've had a mention of boobs.
8497000	8502000	Speaking of cocks, Guns N' Roses Chinese...
8506000	8510000	Wow, Loki just won best transition ever. Congratulations.
8510000	8516000	Guns N' Roses Chinese Democracy album is coming to Rock Band this spring.
8516000	8520000	Yeah, no word on the price, but it's coming.
8520000	8523000	Don't worry, it's going to be delayed.
8523000	8530000	It's going to be coming actually February 28th, so that's kind of soon.
8530000	8539000	And then also, Rock Band is going to be getting some new download content with the re-release of Pearl Jam's X album.
8539000	8544000	They're going to have a code for three bonus tracks in Rock Band.
8544000	8547000	Very similar to what they did with System of the Down.
8547000	8550000	I think they had three tracks that were available with their album as well.
8550000	8554000	So you can probably bet that these will be available as well later on.
8554000	8557000	But the three tracks will be available for free download.
8557000	8560000	Brother, Alive, and State of Love and Trust.
8560000	8564000	Rock Band is costing themselves some serious cool points.
8564000	8569000	First was the janky way you had to pay 40 bucks for ACDC Live, which you can get for 30 bucks now.
8569000	8572000	The second is the whole Chinese democracy thing.
8572000	8576000	Come on, quit trying to stuff like these giant packs on us.
8576000	8578000	It's terrible. Terrible stuff.
8578000	8581000	Making us buy ACDs. Just put them up on the network. Come on.
8581000	8586000	Well, it's going to be on the network. The Chinese democracy thing is going to be on the network.
8586000	8588000	Yeah, but see, that just sucks.
8588000	8591000	It's not that I'm trying to say it's like, oh, they're doing it that way.
8591000	8594000	I'm just trying to say it's like, come on, bring us something that's relevant that we want.
8594000	8599000	Axl doesn't deserve to be rewarded. Axl deserves to be punched in the face.
8599000	8606000	And the ACDC thing, I want ACDC Live, but I don't want to pay 30 bucks for it.
8606000	8609000	When it hits 20 at Walmart, I'm there.
8609000	8615000	I'm excited about Pearl Jam. That is their single best and only fantastic album.
8615000	8617000	How long is that album? Are we out?
8617000	8618000	Yes.
8618000	8623000	That is one of the last CDs that I have ever owned.
8623000	8626000	That every damn track on it was fantastic.
8626000	8628000	Can we seriously get a Journey album right now?
8628000	8629000	No shit.
8629000	8630000	Seriously?
8630000	8632000	And it's not that Pearl Jam isn't good.
8632000	8634000	It's just that Journey's better.
8634000	8639000	Right. But I don't want to buy 10 again so I can get three rock band songs.
8639000	8643000	And yes, there's a there's a egregious dearth of Journey.
8643000	8645000	There needs to be way more of it.
8645000	8647000	Every Journey song would be great.
8647000	8651000	For real. That's what they need to be selling at Walmart, is the Journey game.
8651000	8653000	What is the one that's on...
8653000	8656000	Any way you want it, that's the way you need it.
8656000	8658000	That's great. But I mean, there's...
8658000	8660000	So much more. So much more.
8660000	8664000	A little more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line.
8664000	8668000	We love our music game roots and we have to mention music games whenever we see new ones.
8668000	8669000	That's right.
8669000	8671000	I don't know if this one exactly would qualify.
8671000	8673000	It's a game called D-Pad Hero.
8673000	8679000	That's right. There's so much love out there for Guitar Hero and everything that this whole thing started.
8679000	8683000	That they have actually made a retro demake, not a remake.
8683000	8685000	I don't know how you feel. I know you love remakes.
8685000	8687000	I don't know how you feel about demakes though.
8687000	8692000	D-Pad Hero. That's right. It's Guitar Hero, but you use the D-Pad to play the game.
8692000	8696000	And actually, there's actually a little video that leaked on YouTube here.
8696000	8700000	I shouldn't say leaked, but they actually put it out here kind of showing how the game works.
8700000	8704000	If you're hearing the noises in the background there, that's what I'm trying to load here in studio.
8704000	8707000	Although it's kind of having a hard time buffering.
8707000	8710000	I was so sure you said D-Bag Hero at first. I didn't even...
8710000	8712000	Like Douchebag Hero?
8712000	8716000	I don't think that would play exactly the same way.
8716000	8719000	I was like, what? Oh. Oh, okay.
8719000	8722000	No, not D-Bag Hero. D-Pad Hero.
8722000	8726000	Sorry. Enunciate.
8726000	8728000	Alright, I just need to clean my ears or something.
8728000	8730000	Anyhow, I don't know why the video's not working, but it's not.
8730000	8732000	But apparently you have all these different...
8732000	8734000	But the thing is that you actually...
8734000	8735000	You guys know he's making that up, right?
8735000	8738000	You actually get these music things in NES style.
8738000	8744000	So it actually has, speaking of Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine that you can actually play in like it's NES style.
8744000	8747000	There you go. I really want to see if we can get a...
8747000	8750000	Because they actually have this too.
8750000	8754000	They have Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger in this game as well by Daft Punk.
8754000	8759000	Let me see if one of these other videos will work here a little better.
8759000	8764000	Let's see, here's a little...
8764000	8766000	And these little things fall down.
8766000	8770000	Looks like you actually hold the D-Pad in a certain direction when you push the button.
8770000	8772000	So it does have a little bit of a challenge to it.
8772000	8774000	And there actually is a little audience that rocks out.
8774000	8781000	See, there's like one guy bobbing up and down there in the background.
8781000	8784000	This song is awesome.
8784000	8791000	This is actually a pretty faithful remake of the song.
8791000	8794000	And Amae Satsuma in chat says,
8794000	8803000	He wants Tea Bag Hero. I don't know about that. Featuring an all Madonna soundtrack. I don't know about that.
8803000	8806000	Alright, that's going to do it for news right now.
8806000	8810000	Let's go to the Skype line, but actually we're going to take a call right off the top here.
8810000	8812000	We actually have some people sitting there waiting on hold.
8812000	8814000	Callers, you guys there?
8814000	8815000	Yeah, we're here.
8815000	8819000	Hi. Hello, hello. This is Rama and SSJ100 Matt, correct?
8819000	8821000	Yep, we're here.
8821000	8824000	So why are you kids calling us tonight? What's going on?
8824000	8826000	New York Comic Con.
8826000	8828000	Ah, that's right. Of course, our New York City listeners.
8828000	8831000	I'm sure you guys were banging down the doors of New York Comic Con.
8831000	8833000	How was it? Tell us about it, you guys.
8833000	8835000	You first, Matt.
8835000	8837000	Well, I had a lot of fun.
8837000	8842000	I mean, this is the first Comic Con I went to because this is the first time I've been back in New York for a long time.
8842000	8852000	But, Comic Con has kind of turned itself into, you know, a normal comic convention into, you know, just a whole geek fest of everything.
8852000	8857000	And now, this year, they kind of expanded the game section.
8857000	8860000	So now half the convention is more so video game stuff.
8860000	8866000	And they had a lot of new games there that I was excited to play, so.
8866000	8872000	That's cool. It sounds like it's practically turning into the San Diego Comic Con because they don't really talk about comics at the San Diego.
8872000	8875000	No, they do. But, I mean, a lot of it is Hollywood panels.
8875000	8881000	Like, when I heard there was a Sarah Silverman show panel at Comic Con, I'm like, what the fuck does that have to do with comics? Nothing.
8881000	8885000	We read comic books, so we should have a panel. I don't know.
8885000	8888000	Comic Con has long since been perverted away from comic books.
8888000	8892000	Apparently. But that's okay. We like gaming, so that's pretty cool.
8892000	8898000	And I just want to point out, guys, as well, since we are kind of getting used to this whole new Skype setup,
8898000	8904000	they can't hear the Skype calls on Justin.tv, and that's just one of the downsides to the way things are wired now and have the better sound quality.
8904000	8909000	So, sadly, if you want to hear both ends of the call, you have to be tuned into All Games Radio, where we're turning in live.
8909000	8914000	Sorry, guys. We'll see if we can fix that in the future, but can't do it right now while we're on a call.
8914000	8918000	So tell us about the types. What games did you guys get out there and actually play?
8918000	8923000	Well, actually, to tell you the truth, it was very, very easy to play a lot of the games.
8923000	8929000	I was surprised, because I went there on Saturday, where it was the busy, busy day, where everyone was there.
8929000	8936000	So I had to wait about 15 minutes, probably, per game to get up a game.
8936000	8942000	But I could spend the entire call talking about every single game there, but I'll just talk about three.
8942000	8950000	The three that I got a chance to play were MadWorld, which is coming out for the Wii.
8950000	8958000	If anyone hasn't seen it, it's kind of like if Sin City was a Wii game.
8958000	8965000	Interesting. So this is a nice departure from Wii Mageddon, which has been talked about earlier, and I've heard about this game before.
8965000	8966000	MadWorld, Dan?
8966000	8968000	MadWorld. We got to check it out last September.
8968000	8969000	You a fan?
8969000	8973000	It's pretty hardcore for a Wii game.
8973000	8980000	It's kind of got a Killer7 vibe, if anyone's checked out Killer7, but it's hyper-violent.
8980000	8985000	It's all black and white, except for when you're laying out some carnage and then you get a lot of blood.
8985000	8988000	Definitely one of the coolest titles for the Wii.
8988000	8990000	What did you think, Matt?
8990000	8992000	I thought it was great.
8992000	9006000	They had a challenge in the game where you basically have to shove guys into a pit, and every couple of minutes a giant thing just drops down and crushes everything in the pit.
9006000	9015000	It was funny. Every single time you throw a guy in, they get crushed. A pool of blood slowly fills up, and more guys you throw in there, they start drowning in the blood.
9015000	9021000	It's a pretty brutal game, and it might get me to buy a Wii game.
9021000	9027000	Interesting. All right. That's a pretty hearty endorsement. What else did you check out?
9027000	9034000	Another game which I think Loki would be interested in is Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars for the DS.
9034000	9037000	I heard this was out on the floor. What did you think?
9037000	9051000	When I originally heard they were going to make a Grand Theft Auto DS game, I was kind of skeptical, but when I got a chance to play it, I got admitted. It's a pretty good game.
9051000	9067000	It kind of goes back to the old top-down GTAs, like GTA 2, but the animation is very smooth and everything. It's got a lot of cute gimmicks in it.
9067000	9076000	If you're calling for a cab, you basically whistle into the DS for the cab. It's got a lot of cool things like that.
9076000	9082000	Is there any special thing for when you want to get the hooker to blow you in the shooter?
9082000	9087000	You've got to hold some money up in front of it and crinkle the dollars together.
9087000	9096000	Seriously though, if you want to see what Grand Theft Auto is going to look like when it's on Nintendo 64, there you go. Chinatown Wars, baby.
9096000	9104000	They've got a little thing in there where it's like Dope Wars, if you kind of remember that from old handheld calculators and all that.
9104000	9108000	That Dope Wars was awesome.
9108000	9112000	Loki, anything you want to say about the Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?
9112000	9114000	Looks neat. I'm planning on playing it.
9114000	9116000	What was the third game?
9116000	9123000	The third game, which I consider was the best game there, was the Ghostbusters game.
9123000	9128000	I've heard some good things about this. Tell us a little bit about the Ghostbusters game. What's it like?
9128000	9138000	It's kind of like what everyone seems to think it is. It looks and feels like Gears of War, but with Ghostbusters.
9138000	9140000	What version did they have there?
9140000	9151000	They had every single version. They had the PS3, the 360, and the Wii version. The Wii version is the only one that looks different. It kind of looks a little more cartoony than the others.
9151000	9158000	It's just as fun. I managed to get to play the Wii and the 360.
9158000	9168000	I heard that the Wii was an FPS version where you use your remote to capture ghosts and your nunchuck for movement.
9168000	9172000	The 360 version is more like a third person shooter.
9172000	9176000	You basically use the nunchuck to throw the trap and all that.
9176000	9180000	That's awesome.
9180000	9186000	Matt, I've been letting you do all the talking, but Rama, did you go too? What did you check out?
9186000	9195000	I was mostly in the dealer's room, but I was able to check out one game. I think it's a game that everybody loves. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in Time.
9195000	9200000	It was there to celebrate the 25th shell-a-versary of the Ninja Turtles.
9200000	9207000	The shell-a-versary. I heard there was an old school Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine there.
9207000	9212000	Yes, and there were crowds upon crowds for people to jump in and play.
9212000	9222000	Isn't that sad that with all these new games that are making their debut there, you have Jumpgate and Prototype and Madworld and WrestleMania and Conduit.
9222000	9226000	People are lining up to play TMNT 2, the arcade game.
9226000	9230000	Because quality persists. That is an amazing game.
9230000	9233000	I'd be in line playing that.
9233000	9242000	The last E3 we got to go to, there was a DDR and 2DX machine that year and there were people that were playing it all day long.
9242000	9245000	And I'm like, dude, you guys are at E3 and you're playing fucking DDR?
9245000	9251000	Was that a recent mix of 2DX or was it like an old one?
9251000	9256000	It was a mix of 2DX that you can't really get at the time. Wasn't here yet.
9256000	9259000	But the DDR mix I don't think was anything new. I think they just had Supernova.
9259000	9261000	So it was kind of surprising.
9261000	9263000	Was it Supernova 2? I don't remember. It was a while ago.
9263000	9265000	It was a while ago.
9265000	9269000	Anyway, enough about a years old con.
9269000	9271000	Actually, I don't think it was Supernova 2.
9271000	9273000	Oh, it doesn't matter.
9273000	9274000	It wasn't out.
9274000	9276000	I want to hear about New York Con.
9276000	9281000	So you got to play the new Turtles thing and how was it?
9281000	9287000	The new Turtles game, I'm not sure if they had it on out for own.
9287000	9288000	I didn't think so.
9288000	9289000	They just kept advertising it.
9289000	9293000	I do know it was pretty much from the people that did on Smash Brothers Brawl.
9293000	9296000	So I think this is going to be a good title that they're working on.
9296000	9300000	Well, we'll see. I'm a little skeptical because some of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games are kind of ass, but we'll see.
9300000	9302000	Did anybody see Hawks?
9302000	9303000	It was on display.
9303000	9304000	Yeah, I got to play Hawks.
9304000	9306000	How was it?
9306000	9309000	It's like a very polished Ace Combat.
9309000	9311000	Sweet.
9311000	9313000	And yeah, it's a lot of fun.
9313000	9315000	I like shooting things with jets.
9315000	9319000	Alright, so really quickly guys, then we're going to let you go because we've got to get some more calls because we're kind of running long tonight.
9319000	9324000	But best thing you saw at Comic Con, Matt?
9324000	9331000	Aside from the Ghostbusters game, there's a new game called Prototype, which is coming out for the 360.
9331000	9333000	It's awesome.
9333000	9345000	It's everything what Spider-Man Web of Shadows should have been. It's really brutal and free roam New York City mutant thing. It's really great.
9345000	9348000	Alright, and Rama, best thing?
9348000	9351000	It has to be a tie. Number one, the Ninja Turtles arcade machine.
9351000	9359000	And number two, the attempt at breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for the biggest amount of video game cosplayers and one shutting.
9359000	9361000	Did you break it?
9361000	9367000	No. The record was 342. There was 90 of us.
9367000	9369000	Street Fighter IV there?
9369000	9371000	Maybe next year.
9371000	9373000	I suppose I think it was. I don't know.
9373000	9375000	Was it your favorite?
9375000	9377000	Wait, what?
9377000	9379000	You saying Street Fighter IV was there and it wasn't your favorite?
9379000	9381000	Okay.
9381000	9383000	Well, I didn't see it there.
9383000	9385000	Ron Tron.
9385000	9387000	Yes?
9387000	9389000	We need to do that at Fandame.
9389000	9392000	No, because that title has got to come back to the US.
9392000	9394000	We need to do this at Fandame.
9394000	9396000	Alright.
9396000	9402000	Before I go, if you see pictures of us at the video game shoot, you'll be seeing me in the back holding up a giant Super NES.
9402000	9404000	Nice.
9404000	9409000	And actually two quick last things. I'm posting pictures in the chat regularly.
9409000	9411000	Awesome.
9411000	9417000	And also one very last thing. Expect a care package of schwag coming in the mail.
9417000	9419000	Oh, you guys are the best.
9419000	9423000	I love the fans. We don't even have to go to these events and we get goodies. Love it.
9423000	9425000	Thank you guys so much.
9425000	9427000	Not a problem.
9427000	9429000	Have a good one, kids. See you later.
9429000	9435000	Speaking of our fans doing nice stuff for us, I would like to personally thank IkumaJP for the box of puka.
9435000	9439000	Which, by the way, I do still have some of the nom noms in the house if you guys want some of the nom noms.
9439000	9442000	Alright, we're going to go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9442000	9444000	Hi, this is Spazinator.
9444000	9446000	Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
9446000	9448000	Two quick questions.
9448000	9460000	With the Xbox 360, do you know if there's a hard driver available that's bigger than 120 gigs?
9460000	9463000	Not yet. It's just a matter of time, though.
9463000	9472000	Well, the reason I ask is because I hate to see it, but my hard drive is running out of space as it is.
9472000	9486000	Also, secondly, can you think of any retro games that you would like to see released for any one of those three systems?
9486000	9489000	I'm sorry, run that by me one more time?
9489000	9503000	You know how retro games are kind of big and they're constantly getting released for all three systems, whether it be Wii, Virtual Console, the PlayStation 3, or XBLA.
9503000	9511000	Can you think of any game that you would like to see released for one of those three, or are you pretty much all set?
9511000	9513000	Mega Man 10.
9513000	9517000	What, that will be released, or that was released?
9517000	9520000	You would like to because he released.
9520000	9522000	Mega Man 10 at some point would be awesome.
9522000	9526000	As long as they stay with the Mega Man 9 series and do a Mega Man 10, that'd be great.
9526000	9536000	Mega Man 9 was awesome for all three systems, but of course was the best on the Wii because it was just the most authentic retro, new retro experience.
9536000	9546000	I'm surprised that, I mean, I'm not surprised, but Bionic Commando Rearmed would be really nice on the Wii if they decided to do it.
9546000	9554000	I don't think the game that needs to be remade, that was out before its time, and I mean, I know that I hate this game and I hate the fanboys for it.
9554000	9558000	Although I approve of fanboyism and go for it, love what you love.
9558000	9565000	I really think that the game that needs a remake, needs it for anything powerful enough to run it, is Final Fantasy VII.
9565000	9573000	So I'd like to see Final Fantasy VII remade for every console with state-of-the-art 3D graphics and the storyline re-translated so it makes sense,
9573000	9577000	and more party options, and just kind of the fleshing out that it really needs.
9577000	9583000	But you know if they make it they're just going to dumb it down, it's going to be simpler and easier than it even was before, which was too easy to do.
9583000	9586000	But at least it'll have real nice CGI.
9586000	9593000	Yeah, I definitely agree with you. I'd love to see a remake of VII, you know, because I used to love that game.
9593000	9601000	Unfortunately I don't have my copy of it anymore, so if they ever do release the game again, I'll buy it.
9601000	9608000	I'll buy anything but the DS, you know, because the DS will just basically be able to do it as it originally was.
9608000	9611000	Well, thank you for taking my call.
9611000	9613000	You are welcome.
9613000	9615000	Alright, you have a good one.
9615000	9617000	Take care Spazinator, have a good one.
9617000	9623000	I don't know whether Final Fantasy VII would fit on Xbox Live Arcade, that's the only problem I see going on with that, but who knows, we'll see.
9623000	9626000	Yeah, because you know if they wanted to make it, Microsoft wouldn't make an exception.
9626000	9628000	We'll see. Alright, we got another call.
9628000	9631000	Hello, this is DSMaster25.
9631000	9633000	Hi, what's on your mind?
9633000	9640000	Not much. Urban got a PSP 2000, but it's kind of flukey on me, I buy it used.
9640000	9649000	Wait, I find this ironic, because your name is DSMaster, yet I'm looking at your logo on Skype and your call is about a PSP. Please explain.
9649000	9659000	Basically, I was desperate for one, because I wanted Skype and everything, so I figured why not buy a PSP, so basically I did.
9659000	9661000	You wanted what game?
9661000	9671000	I wanted to use Skype, portably, but the Skype zones were not in America, so the only other option was a PSP.
9671000	9674000	Interesting, okay, okay.
9674000	9686000	So basically, I bought one used, now I have this cracked on my screen, and now my start button, my select button, my home button, all that doesn't work.
9686000	9696000	It sounds like you have a broken PSP. I would recommend replacing it with a new working one, preferably a 3000 series, because if you wanted to use Skype...
9696000	9700000	He said he bought it used, I'm curious, did you buy it used at GameStop?
9700000	9702000	Yes.
9702000	9708000	Sad trombone.
9708000	9714000	Well, did you buy it like that, or did you buy it nice and you made it like that?
9714000	9721000	Because if you bought it like that, take that puppy back. Hopefully you were smart enough to buy the extended service on it.
9721000	9728000	Unfortunately, I was dead broke by the time I bought the PSP, so I didn't have any money to buy the extended service.
9728000	9730000	Sad trombone.
9730000	9732000	What was wrong with the PSP now?
9732000	9737000	This is just a sad trombone call.
9737000	9751000	Basically, the home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and sound...
9751000	9760000	Do they not test these things? Do they not notice him scratch on the screen, or a big crack on the screen?
9760000	9765000	Because I know when you have to go trade stuff in there, it's like, does this shit work?
9765000	9772000	Well, here's the deal. You're about to get an education as to the inside workings of used game stores.
9772000	9783000	They get ranked on how much they get traded in, so a lot of times they'll let crap slide, and then they get ranked on selling you stuff.
9783000	9786000	So they're going to try to foist it on you.
9786000	9793000	Now, there are game stores like mine where if you bring me a system, man, I'm looking for a reason to say no, because I'm a jerk.
9793000	9801000	Honest. It's like, you bring me an Xbox, I've already got five Xboxes. If that thing ain't pristine, I'm like, take it home with you. I don't want it.
9801000	9808000	But at the same time, it's like, if you bought a system from GameStop, and it's broken, you have a guarantee. Hopefully you didn't buy it that long ago.
9808000	9811000	Take that puppy back. Make him exchange it for a nice one.
9811000	9819000	If you bought it months ago, and you've just been dealing with it being all broken, and you let it go, I mean, you better go to the manager and bank.
9819000	9825000	And just, you know, don't be a jerk about it, because he'll dig in, but, you know, hopefully they can give you some satisfaction.
9825000	9833000	Don't try to be like, well, I want a new system or my money back. Just be like, look, I'm not looking for anything more than the same unit in nice shape.
9833000	9841000	You know, that works for what I need to do. You know, systems get tested, but it's, every store is run by different people.
9841000	9847000	That's why there's bad, you know, GameStop as a corporation is reasonably evil, but that's just like any corporation.
9847000	9851000	They're there to make money. There's good stores, and those stores deserve you to go shop there.
9851000	9857000	And there's bad stores, and those stores deserve for you to sit outside in your running car, and when they come out at night, just run them over.
9857000	9862000	And then maybe they'll get some good people in there, and you can have another good game store.
9862000	9865000	Orange House Radio does not actually endorse this thing.
9865000	9867000	So what you're telling me-
9867000	9870000	Okay, they may not endorse it officially, but you know they're all down with it.
9870000	9872000	I'm down with it.
9872000	9882000	Hey, so what you're telling me is basically go back in there, because my 30 day guarantee has already passed, because I bought this on December 22nd.
9882000	9889000	Otherwise, you know, the buttons and stuff not working? I mean, which buttons are not working on there?
9889000	9897000	The home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and the sound equizer.
9897000	9898000	For what it's worth?
9898000	9904000	Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Stop, stop you guys. Okay, so basically all the buttons on that bottom row, right?
9904000	9908000	Yeah, except for start. That's the only one that works.
9908000	9916000	It sounds like the ribbon cable's loose in there, so that would be easy enough just to take it apart, and you can actually plug that back in if you want to do that.
9916000	9920000	And then replacing the screen's like 30 bucks, I think.
9920000	9923000	Well, that's if they stonewall you on just giving you some satisfaction.
9923000	9929000	I believe GameStop has a one month guarantee on a used system. Get that puppy back ASAP.
9929000	9935000	Now, if you chopped a game crazy, we'd give you a 90 day guarantee without you even paying any extra money.
9935000	9937000	Nice, nice. Now here's the thing.
9937000	9938000	Plug, plug, plug.
9938000	9940000	For what it's worth, your call sounds great.
9940000	9950000	And you'll be funny with the PSP system. I don't know if you could do one on them where you buy a used system and swap it for the broken one.
9950000	9952000	You sold me a busted system.
9952000	9958000	They're serial numbered, but I mean, you know, if you want to try a fast one that's on you, I can't tell you to do that or not tell you that.
9958000	9961000	That's up to your quality of being a human being.
9961000	9966000	But, hey, I won't say I've never done anything like that.
9966000	9971000	I think I'm going to wait until I get money, and then I'm going to buy 3,000.
9971000	9976000	You know, go back. And then I'll use this one for like emulators.
9976000	9978000	That's a good idea.
9978000	9985000	I think the advice too would just be, you know what, go in, anyone else that finds themselves in this situation, go in, be nice about it.
9985000	9989000	Don't be a dick because no manager is going to want to do favors for you if you're a dick.
9989000	9992000	Go in, be nice about it, and see if they'll do a favor for you.
9992000	9994000	And if not, run them over with your car.
9994000	9998000	But your other idea was great, especially if, like Loki says, there's a ribbon cable in there.
9998000	10005000	If you like taking crap apart, and you're out of warranty and can't get any help, take that puppy apart.
10005000	10007000	PSPs are awesome inside.
10007000	10010000	There's all sorts of cool stuff you can do with them.
10010000	10015000	You can blow up their batteries and lose pieces, change the color of the buttons.
10015000	10017000	Turn them into lasers?
10017000	10023000	No, but seriously, there's a lot of stuff inside there.
10023000	10028000	If someone took it apart to, I don't know, do something, you know, they may have accidentally fucked something up.
10028000	10032000	Because it's pretty easy to do that because I've done that before when I took something apart.
10032000	10037000	Oh, the ribbon cable's not all the way in, and you have to really shove that puppy back in there, and then it'll probably work.
10037000	10042000	Because it sounds like that might be the issue, because all of a sudden the buttons won't just die.
10042000	10044000	It's the ribbon cable.
10044000	10047000	Yeah, one of the janky things about used PSPs, you've got to watch out.
10047000	10054000	No, but basically what happened was I bought it, and all the bottom row buttons were working just fine.
10054000	10059000	And then the Monday show after, I was listening to you guys in the shower, okay?
10059000	10061000	Oh, so now it's our fault.
10061000	10063000	No, no, no, no.
10063000	10065000	Now, see, this is just getting weird in reverse.
10065000	10071000	Basically, I'm trying to change the volume, and I'm reaching through the shower curtain, and I think I might jump some water, but I don't know.
10071000	10076000	Well, see, okay, now wait a minute. Now this is all on you, buddy. You broke your PSP.
10076000	10081000	Okay, keep this one for use in the shower, and you're doing it, and keep it away from the water.
10081000	10083000	What is the water?
10083000	10087000	I'm just curious, is this an OA verse that you've been listening to in the shower?
10087000	10089000	I'm just curious.
10089000	10097000	If you do want to use it in the shower, they do sell waterproof cases you can put on the PSP.
10097000	10100000	All right, DS Master, we've got to let you go to get some more help.
10100000	10102000	I'm just saying, if that's your thing.
10102000	10104000	Are you all soapy?
10104000	10106000	Good luck.
10106000	10114000	DS Master, good luck to you, and next thing, if you do get a new PSP, keep it out of the bathtub.
10114000	10121000	By the way, the only reason why I bought this one was because I was speculating about the scan lines on the 3000 model.
10121000	10123000	Now I figured it's not such an interesting issue.
10123000	10125000	It's all the same, it just has a mic.
10125000	10131000	All right, good luck, PSP, DS Master, whoever you are, and have a good one, okay?
10131000	10133000	All right, bye.
10133000	10137000	I don't know if that guy's ever called in before. I might have been a first-time caller, so that was a good call.
10137000	10147000	I like the... Oh, good times. We'll try to do at least one more call here and then wrap up the show.
10147000	10149000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10149000	10151000	It's Death Wishing. Hey, what's up?
10151000	10154000	Well, hi, Death Wishing. You're a first-time caller too, aren't you?
10154000	10156000	Yep.
10156000	10158000	What's on your mind?
10158000	10165000	I'm kind of disappointed with a lot of stuff I see in this year for gaming.
10165000	10170000	In this year of gaming, in 2009 in gaming? How so? Just because it seems like there's nothing to look forward to?
10170000	10175000	I know it just started, but it's just... I don't know. This summer seems a lot more droughted.
10175000	10178000	I can already tell this summer it's going to be a major drought for gaming.
10178000	10182000	Do you think it might be that everybody's trying to keep it in their pants until E3?
10182000	10185000	That's kind of one thing I've been trying to tell myself as much as I might be lying to myself.
10185000	10187000	Maybe people are trying to keep it in their pants until E3.
10187000	10189000	That would be different.
10189000	10195000	You've got to remember, games and game developers are like plants.
10195000	10199000	And their water is money. And there's no money out there right now.
10199000	10203000	So things are quiet.
10203000	10207000	You've got to actually think, this summer there's not going to be crap anyway.
10207000	10210000	You've got to look towards the fourth quarter.
10210000	10214000	They're not going to be making announcements about the fourth quarter until mid-spring,
10214000	10218000	when they've gotten through the Street Fighter IV and the Resident Evils and the Killzone II.
10218000	10222000	You've got some... I mean if you actually think about it, this is a great spring for games.
10222000	10228000	There are some just nice AAA titles for every system.
10228000	10231000	Nintendo had a great Christmas, at least in the States with the Wii.
10231000	10235000	I know they're having a lot of trouble in Japan.
10235000	10240000	But really, I think that if you look at a lot of the release lists and whatnot,
10240000	10244000	there's a lot of cool stuff coming out for everybody.
10244000	10249000	Skip the Summer, there'll be a big title or two, but it's not going to blow any wind up your skirt.
10249000	10254000	And then just look to the fourth quarter, man.
10254000	10256000	That's where all the big games are.
10256000	10260000	Dan does have a point, because our economy is in such shit right now in the US.
10260000	10262000	I don't know if you're calling for the US or wherever.
10262000	10268000	But the thing is, it seems like on this show, week after week after week,
10268000	10272000	we've been reporting, this studio has closed, this studio has closed, this studio has closed.
10272000	10275000	So damn, we're kind of lucky to be getting to get any games at all at this point.
10275000	10278000	But I do kind of agree. I feel that same frustration.
10278000	10282000	It seems like every game comes out at Christmas.
10282000	10286000	It seems like the rest of the year, and we don't know what's coming out at Christmas yet,
10286000	10289000	because they're going to wait and announce all that stuff at E3 probably.
10289000	10290000	You're going to see all the Christmas titles.
10290000	10295000	But right now, especially on Nintendo, it seems like there's nothing to look forward to on the Wii.
10295000	10299000	There's a couple gems here and there on 360 and PS3.
10299000	10303000	Maybe your Street Fighter IV. There are some little things here and there, but not enough.
10303000	10308000	Gamers get spoiled. They expect big releases every month.
10308000	10312000	Maybe because Hollywood spoils us. There's a big movie every week.
10312000	10314000	Movie games still happen.
10314000	10316000	So don't get me started on movie games.
10316000	10322000	You're not in the first two years of any console's development cycle now.
10322000	10327000	They've all proven what they have to prove, except for Sony.
10327000	10332000	Look at Sony's lineup. They've got three killers.
10332000	10336000	They've got Killzone, which is two weeks a week away.
10336000	10341000	They've got Uncharted 2, which if you have a PS3, Uncharted is fantastic,
10341000	10343000	and it's really good, and you should have played it.
10343000	10346000	And they've got God of War.
10346000	10353000	Microsoft is kind of like, oh, we've got ODST. We've got Halo, but it's not really Halo.
10353000	10356000	And they've kind of let their big franchises slip away from them.
10356000	10358000	Nintendo, there was an article not far back.
10358000	10361000	Nintendo's got half a dozen really cool releases coming up for the Wii,
10361000	10365000	but it's all your ma and pa mainstream stuff, except we've got Punch-Out on there.
10365000	10367000	Punch-Out for the Wii should be pretty cool.
10367000	10369000	But not as cool as Street Fighter IV.
10369000	10372000	Dude, I don't know if Punch-Out is awesome.
10372000	10375000	But it's not Street Fighter IV. Punch-Out and Street Fighter IV.
10375000	10378000	The Wii and the PS3 and the 360, they're two different worlds.
10378000	10381000	What does Mike Tyson have on a Hadoop, honestly?
10381000	10383000	Dude, have you played Mike Tyson's Punch-Out?
10383000	10388000	If you threw Ryu in there against Mike Tyson, he's got a one uppercut knockdown.
10388000	10391000	But there's Ryu and Ken, and one's Hadoop, and one's Hadoop.
10391000	10395000	I'm not a Hadoopkin. It's going to take off a third of your life.
10395000	10399000	Mike Tyson takes off all your life with one punch.
10399000	10404000	And if you don't dodge all those punches, you can't even block him.
10404000	10407000	He made Shang Rong look like a sissy.
10407000	10411000	You know what we have now? We have Obama with the veto uppercut.
10411000	10416000	I fought Akuma last night in HD Remix, and I got beat uncontrollably hard.
10416000	10420000	But at least I could hit him. Mike Tyson and Punch-Out, your ass is grass.
10420000	10425000	Put in 0073735963 in the password. Fight Mike Tyson.
10425000	10429000	If you beat him, then I'm going to give you your props.
10429000	10432000	Wait, let me ask this as well real quick.
10432000	10436000	For what it's worth, are you a 360 owner?
10436000	10438000	Yes, I do own a 360.
10438000	10440000	Does it still work?
10440000	10445000	Okay, honestly, I'm on my second 360, and I had it from release.
10445000	10448000	Okay, me too. I'm on my second one after release too.
10448000	10450000	But actually, what I just kind of want to ask, I don't know,
10450000	10454000	but just kind of also something that can kind of tide you over,
10454000	10458000	is that don't forget, you still have coming out every week,
10458000	10461000	not just Xbox Live Arcade games, but community games.
10461000	10465000	And I realize there's a lot of poop out there in the community games,
10465000	10467000	but there's a lot of pretty awesome stuff too.
10467000	10470000	And you know, when you consider that in the retail world,
10470000	10472000	you know, we get poop as well, like Fusion Frenzy
10472000	10474000	and that fucking Crosswords game that I played this week.
10474000	10475000	It was god awful.
10475000	10476000	You know, you get a lot of that stuff.
10476000	10478000	There's some pretty cool stuff that comes out too.
10478000	10481000	So if you're feeling like, damn, I need a fix of something new,
10481000	10483000	check out the community games.
10483000	10485000	You might not see anything that's going to blow you away,
10485000	10487000	but you might see something that, you know,
10487000	10490000	a neat concept for a game that keeps you entertained for a little while,
10490000	10491000	which is, you know, what a game should do.
10491000	10494000	And when you consider those community games are dirt cheap,
10494000	10496000	eh, it's something.
10496000	10498000	And look past the big franchises.
10498000	10501000	Bionic Commando, which is coming out in a couple months, a month or so.
10501000	10503000	Looks great.
10503000	10505000	Mad World, which we talked about a few minutes ago.
10505000	10507000	It's mind blowing.
10507000	10510000	Halo Wars is actually pretty fun.
10510000	10512000	You know, there's a lot of stuff coming up this year,
10512000	10515000	but maybe it's not Devil May Cry 5.
10515000	10517000	Maybe it's not Halo 4.
10517000	10520000	Just, you know, let that stuff lay for a while.
10520000	10521000	You know they're going to rehash it.
10521000	10522000	They're going to spit it at us.
10522000	10523000	There's going to be a marketing blitz.
10523000	10527000	You know, there's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 and 6 and 8 and 10.
10527000	10530000	But, you know, here's your chance to branch out.
10530000	10532000	Try some new games.
10532000	10535000	You know, just because they're not beating you down with another AAA title
10535000	10538000	doesn't mean there aren't super high quality games by great developers
10538000	10543000	who still have jobs, knock on wood, and will be blowing you out of the water.
10543000	10545000	And like I said, look to the fourth quarter,
10545000	10546000	because there are big names announced.
10546000	10548000	Especially if you don't have a Sony, you know,
10548000	10554000	go for God of War is going to be, you know, blamed by the better.
10554000	10555000	Badass.
10555000	10556000	All right.
10556000	10557000	Death Wishing, we've got to let you go to close out the show,
10557000	10559000	but thanks a bunch and thanks for tuning in tonight.
10559000	10560000	We appreciate it.
10560000	10561000	Love you.
10561000	10563000	All right, see ya.
10563000	10564000	I think so.
10564000	10565000	I love you too.
10565000	10566000	We love you too.
10566000	10568000	Okay.
10568000	10569000	We have last minute stories.
10569000	10570000	Huh?
10570000	10571000	Yeah, we do have some last minute stories.
10571000	10573000	I do want to make an outbound call real quick.
10573000	10574000	This is an important one.
10574000	10575000	We do want to do one more call.
10575000	10577000	This is outbound, because this is important.
10577000	10578000	We want to get this person on the show.
10578000	10580000	And unfortunately, the way our Skype is set up,
10580000	10582000	we have not been able to get like incoming.
10582000	10584000	We just get bombarded with everybody, which we love.
10584000	10586000	You know, we love the fact that so many people are trying to get through,
10586000	10589000	but there is somebody we wanted to talk to that couldn't get through.
10589000	10590000	And we want to talk to him now.
10590000	10591000	Deke, are you there?
10591000	10592000	Yeah, I'm here.
10592000	10593000	Can you guys hear me?
10593000	10594000	Yes, we can.
10594000	10595000	How are you?
10595000	10596000	Oh, not bad.
10596000	10597000	Tired.
10597000	10598000	It's 10 30 here.
10598000	10602000	The reason why I'm letting you have cuts tonight and come to the front of the line.
10602000	10604000	You get cuts tonight is because Deke,
10604000	10607000	you've got the mastermind behind our new website that is out there
10607000	10609000	that the folks have been looking at.
10609000	10610000	Have you been happy with the feedback?
10610000	10612000	It looks like a lot of people like it tonight.
10612000	10613000	So far, yeah.
10613000	10615000	I've only heard maybe one little thing wrong with it,
10615000	10617000	and I'm pretty sure that's got to do with the database move
10617000	10619000	from the old website forums to the new one.
10619000	10621000	And so that should be pretty easy to take care of.
10621000	10623000	I was honestly thinking in the back of my mind
10623000	10625000	that the site would have to be reset.
10625000	10627000	Like I was like, okay, we'll just have to start over with the forums.
10627000	10629000	You know, our news will probably have to start from square one.
10629000	10630000	And I was like ready to accept that.
10630000	10632000	And then when I looked at the new site today, I was like,
10632000	10635000	holy crap, he got everything migrated from the old site.
10635000	10637000	That was pretty impressive.
10637000	10638000	So props to you.
10638000	10639000	Oh, no worries.
10639000	10640000	You know, it's my job.
10640000	10642000	This is what I do for a living, so I'm used to it.
10642000	10646000	Yeah, so we don't pay you, so I mean, I hope the day job does.
10646000	10647000	Send you cookies.
10647000	10651000	Yeah, we will send you a token of our appreciation, don't you worry.
10651000	10654000	But what did you want to call in and talk to the listeners about tonight?
10654000	10656000	That was pretty much it.
10656000	10658000	I just wanted to get your guys' responses to the new website
10658000	10660000	and just find out what you thought.
10660000	10663000	If there's any changes you wanted, just, yeah, that's pretty much it.
10663000	10665000	We'll talk to you offline about some of the little stuff.
10665000	10668000	I think we're going to write some new things to maybe replace some of the dated things,
10668000	10670000	even though you did copy them over from the old site.
10670000	10674000	I think some things could use an 09 update, you know, like where the podcast is at and everything.
10674000	10676000	But other than that, I mean, the site itself looks great.
10676000	10679000	I love the idea of people sending in their own pictures.
10679000	10681000	I hope people don't abuse that, so we have to lock it down.
10681000	10685000	Yeah, I'm going to keep track of that and make sure nobody kind of abuses it.
10685000	10687000	I want to see cocks popping up all over the place.
10687000	10688000	No cock shots.
10688000	10691000	Dar Sakura on break took a picture of me eating jelly beans just randomly
10691000	10693000	and uploaded them to the thing.
10693000	10695000	So I don't know, what should I hold up?
10695000	10697000	Oh, how about cookies? Let's hold up cookies for this,
10697000	10700000	and we'll send it right to the website right now.
10700000	10704000	There you go. I just posted one of myself posing next to the website a couple of minutes ago.
10704000	10706000	Nice. Very nice.
10706000	10707000	I like it.
10707000	10712000	Well, we're very excited about it, and we hope to have it launched maybe next weekend even or something, you know,
10712000	10714000	just as soon as we get some of our new authors on board,
10714000	10718000	because I know Tiara's getting ready to write some game reviews for us.
10718000	10721000	I'm so excited, and we're going to have regular content again.
10721000	10724000	I could just tinkle. I'm so excited.
10724000	10725000	Awesome.
10725000	10726000	Not in here.
10726000	10731000	All right. Well, Deke, thank you so much, and please send our thanks along to your family as well,
10731000	10734000	who I know have had to put up with you working on the site, and we really appreciate it.
10734000	10736000	No worries. Take care, guys.
10736000	10738000	All right. Take care, Deke.
10738000	10740000	Australians are cool.
10740000	10742000	You know, what's funny is that he's actually living in Canada now, though.
10742000	10746000	Canadians are less cool, but okay.
10746000	10749000	It's going to pass because you're there.
10749000	10755000	Well, he definitely still has the Australian accent, but I think it's a little bit of both.
10755000	10756000	Very cool. Very cool.
10756000	10759000	A very international family one way or another, so we appreciate that.
10759000	10762000	He's an Australian guy living in Canada, listening to an American show.
10762000	10764000	The Internet is an amazing thing.
10764000	10766000	All right. That's going to do it.
10766000	10767000	We are going to wrap up the show.
10767000	10769000	Sorry to those that didn't get through on Skype.
10769000	10773000	I know a lot of you were getting through, but I also was very happy to hear some new callers get through tonight.
10773000	10775000	That was pretty awesome, so thanks and shout out.
10775000	10779000	Thanks to the guy who ate up all the time because his system was broken because he's using it in the shower.
10779000	10781000	Well done.
10781000	10785000	I think the Justin TV things actually kind of helped us get some new listeners,
10785000	10787000	so I'm really excited to get back on there.
10787000	10790000	I don't know. I don't think watching a radio show is that exciting,
10790000	10793000	but we'll see what we can do about the TV in the future.
10793000	10795000	Maybe we'll get a Switch box and actually play games.
10795000	10797000	I don't know what we can do. We'll figure something out.
10797000	10803000	I can fix it so the audio, you can hear everything next time.
10803000	10809000	That's easy. Just splitter your speaker out and then into the...
10809000	10811000	They don't want to hear about the wires.
10811000	10813000	We'll make it happen one way or the other.
10813000	10815000	You guys got to see it in here. It's a wiring idea.
10815000	10816000	It's awesome.
10816000	10817000	They're going to take a picture.
10817000	10818000	When I move...
10818000	10820000	So you can see what they go through so you can hear them.
10820000	10823000	I can't live in this house forever because I'm a renter,
10823000	10826000	and someday they're going to kick me out or I'm going to want to actually buy a house.
10826000	10828000	When I move, it's going to suck.
10828000	10831000	Anyway, that's for another time.
10831000	10833000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10833000	10835000	This is going to be a three-hour show this week, but that's all right.
10835000	10837000	First off, I want to say Matt, too.
10837000	10839000	Thank you so much for being here.
10839000	10841000	I'm sorry you didn't get to say more tonight,
10841000	10843000	but we'll talk more about PC games in a future week.
10843000	10844000	You will come back and join us again, correct?
10844000	10845000	It's Dan's fault, yes.
10845000	10848000	No, yes. I had a blast. Thanks for having me.
10848000	10850000	PC gaming is more my niche, but yeah.
10850000	10853000	Tell us, and we will do more PC gaming in the future.
10853000	10855000	There hasn't been a lot this week, and we actually get the emails.
10855000	10857000	Why don't you ask to talk more about PC gaming?
10857000	10860000	That's why I was like, Matt, too, probably sent one of those emails.
10860000	10864000	It needs to come to the show a little more often.
10864000	10866000	I do want to say, though, for the folks out there who listen,
10866000	10870000	who can't join us in studio, how is it different when you're listening to it on the iPod
10870000	10872000	and when you're here in studio?
10872000	10876000	It's actually a great way to kill two to three hours of my afternoon at work,
10876000	10878000	which is quite spectacular.
10878000	10881000	Quality is good, easy access.
10881000	10882000	How's it different being here live?
10882000	10888000	Oh, being here live? It's colder in the garage because my office is a balmy 72 degrees.
10888000	10892000	It's definitely different. There's definitely a lot of wires around.
10892000	10894000	It's a lot of fun.
10894000	10900000	At times I feel like I'm a little behind the times with all the wealth of knowledge that's in here.
10900000	10902000	I feel like the noob.
10902000	10906000	But when we started talking about WoW updates, I felt cool again.
10906000	10909000	Dan's pointing at me. He's about to say something profound.
10909000	10910000	We'll work on you.
10910000	10913000	He says in the world of WoW, you are the king.
10913000	10917000	Sadly, possibly, but no, there are people that out DPS in the tank.
10917000	10918000	In here anyway.
10918000	10920000	In here? Okay, cool. I'll take that title.
10920000	10923000	Sometimes I hear a term involved. I'm like, I know what that means.
10923000	10924000	DPS, sweet.
10924000	10926000	No, I had a blast. Thanks for having me.
10926000	10929000	I look forward to next shows where you'll have room for me.
10929000	10930000	Of course. Anytime, anytime.
10930000	10934000	Dan, what can I say? Thank you so much for being here and bringing in your input.
10934000	10936000	The chatters love you.
10936000	10938000	They want you to be a regular guest on the show.
10938000	10940000	Please come back again, Dan. We had a lot of fun.
10940000	10943000	Even if, even if your wife is a little pissed, you keep taking her microphone.
10943000	10945000	Maybe we'll get two mics on the couch next time or something.
10945000	10946000	Don't bet on it.
10946000	10950000	All right.
10950000	10953000	I am not pissed. It's just.
10953000	10956000	No, she's fine.
10956000	10959000	You are a butt face.
10959000	10960000	That's great.
10960000	10964000	He told her the mic was off.
10964000	10968000	Dark Sakura, do you have any final thoughts?
10968000	10970000	Oh, I didn't even ask for last minute stories.
10970000	10971000	I'm such an asshole.
10971000	10972000	Last minute stories quickly.
10972000	10973000	Dark Sakura.
10973000	10978000	There was a guy named Danny Johnson, 14 of grapevine, Texas.
10978000	10979000	Shut up.
10979000	10986000	Who actually set a new world record in guitar hero at a Guinness world records event in Manhattan.
10986000	10993000	He scored 973,954 points playing dragon forces through the fire and the flames.
10993000	10999000	And from what I read otherwise, um, he actually broke a button while doing it.
10999000	11002000	He broke his blue button and, uh, he was mad at himself.
11002000	11003000	He didn't hit a hundred percent.
11003000	11005000	He only hit 99 percent.
11005000	11011000	I'll link the video in the chat room.
11011000	11013000	Loki, did you have any last minute stories?
11013000	11015000	Yeah, just some real quick stuff.
11015000	11019000	Namco is planning on rebooting the dead to rights franchise in, um.
11019000	11022000	Dear God, why?
11022000	11023000	I don't know.
11023000	11025000	Um, interesting, I guess.
11025000	11029000	And then, um, some other stuff.
11029000	11037000	Apparently some dude, uh, threatened to blow up the Bomberman devs because he had a problem with his Bomberman game, I guess.
11037000	11041000	He had sent them 11 terrorizing emails during a four month period.
11041000	11044000	He was at the company and finally decided to do something.
11044000	11048000	He was unhappy with the quality of Hudson products.
11048000	11049000	He was just getting into the spirit of things.
11049000	11050000	I know.
11050000	11052000	We have one more contribution.
11052000	11053000	Mmm.
11053000	11055000	Oh, jeez.
11055000	11061000	And then, uh, Telltale Games is bringing Wallace and Gromit to a PC and Xbox Live Arcade this spring.
11061000	11062000	I heard about that. It sounds awesome.
11062000	11070000	And then the last thing, and this is completely retarded, but, PlayStation 3 apparently is going to start supporting Ambiex.
11070000	11072000	What the hell is that?
11072000	11077000	Ambiex is a stupid little thing that you plug into your, it's, it's right now for computers.
11077000	11083000	It has, like, colored lights that change colors for, depending on the scenes that are in your, um, game.
11083000	11088000	Then there's also, uh, fans that blow hot and cold air at you and it vibrates and craps.
11088000	11090000	Think about it. That could be cool.
11090000	11092000	Yes, and craps.
11092000	11093000	And craps.
11093000	11096000	You can say, hey, this sucks shit.
11096000	11098000	And it's all, pfft.
11098000	11100000	Wow.
11100000	11103000	That could be a feature in Excite Trucks 2.
11103000	11106000	Now the Trucks crap.
11106000	11113000	I mean, why not? You can see those, you see those guys, like, that drive down the freeway and they have the balls hanging from their trucks?
11113000	11116000	Why not? Now they can crap, too.
11116000	11118000	Don't justify that behavior, Rob.
11118000	11121000	I, well, I think that's the most vile thing possible.
11121000	11124000	If you have that on the back of your truck, take it off your truck and choke yourself with it.
11124000	11128000	Um, seriously.
11128000	11130000	Please die.
11130000	11135000	Also, I have one quick last minute story, or I'm gonna get the crap kicked out of me by you.
11135000	11139000	I'm gonna get the crap kicked out of me by Travis and John over at Undersedation Live.
11139000	11144000	Um, the, I believe they're down to like, I wanna say like 32 games, or 16, how many are they at?
11144000	11147000	2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14.
11147000	11151000	They're down to like the top 32, I think something, games right now.
11151000	11153000	Um, in the March Madness.
11153000	11155000	There's just a shitload of polls right now on our forums.
11155000	11156000	Make sure you vote if you haven't.
11156000	11160000	I believe tomorrow at midnight is when the next round closes and it's gonna go on to the next round.
11160000	11162000	I'm sure somebody will post a link and chat there shortly.
11162000	11165000	And I wanna also apologize, I missed Travis' bachelor party.
11165000	11168000	I was out of town last night and didn't get John's message until very late.
11168000	11171000	But we are sending Travis all our best here from Orange Launch Radio and Jenna.
11171000	11174000	And, uh, hope for the best for them for the future.
11174000	11176000	Hugs and kisses.
11176000	11177000	So.
11177000	11178000	Finally?
11178000	11179000	Yes, yes.
11179000	11181000	Oh my god, this is fantastic!
11181000	11183000	Yes, where have you been? Alright, yes.
11183000	11186000	Marriage is great, isn't it Dan?
11186000	11190000	It's more than I could have ever imagined.
11190000	11193000	And I mean that.
11193000	11199000	Yeah, I guess they're doing the totally cliche Valentine's Day thing, you know, with this weekend coming up.
11199000	11205000	We got engaged in theory on Valentine's Day.
11205000	11207000	Do you know what I did on Valentine's Day?
11207000	11210000	Sat home and cried and ate lean cuisine.
11210000	11211000	That's what I did.
11211000	11213000	No, I'm kidding.
11213000	11221000	But ours was really cool and nerdy because we were watching UHF and eating French bread with spinach dip and drinking munch fries at Swine.
11221000	11227000	I will say one of the coolest Valentine's Days I had was when the ex and I went to the Star Trek experience.
11227000	11231000	Or not the Star Trek experience, but the tour. We went to the Star Trek tour at Long Beach.
11231000	11235000	That was a pretty nerdy test at Valentine's Day, so, you know.
11235000	11239000	Some people get married, some people boldly go where no man has gone before. What can you do?
11239000	11242000	Which kind of are the same thing.
11242000	11247000	Alright, congrats to Travis, sucker.
11247000	11251000	No, actually, Jenna's the real sucker, actually, in that relationship.
11251000	11255000	No, we love him. Sorry I missed the bachelor party. I was out.
11255000	11264000	But yeah, thanks to all you guys for tuning in and listening to us, whether it be on Justin TV or on All Games Radio or on the podcast when it gets updated, which will be sooner than usual.

11269000	11271000	Well, now everyone knows what my home life is like.
11271000	11277000	Heck yeah. Alright. Quickly, final thoughts. I didn't get final thoughts. Dark Soccer, your final thought.
11277000	11279000	You know what you're doing.
11279000	11283000	My final thought is Warpcore Breach, yum. Loki.
11283000	11286000	I need a Cage Man song.
