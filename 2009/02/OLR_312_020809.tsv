14056	24806	Tonight, February 8, 2009, will Netflix on the 360 get a premium upgrade, Time Crisis debuts on the iPhone, and is President Obama a new character in Street Fighter?
31832	33173	I like fire Wait, we didn't hear you, is the mic on?
53051	53732	It is now!
53752	54472	Alright, there we go.
54593	58135	Back from the dead to join us here on Orange Launch Radio.
58155	59116	Because she's been out a couple weeks.
59136	59657	It was gray.
60037	60257	Yeah?
60357	60918	Very gray.
61018	63300	Oh yeah, you went to Prosser, Washington.
63360	64501	Party Central America.
64561	65021	How was that?
65421	66322	I went roller skating.
68864	71847	People did roller skating to be cool like 20 years ago.
72267	75530	I love roller skating, but I found out something very depressing, Rob.
75650	76150	Hmm, what's that?
76390	79152	Since I had... The last time I went roller skating was four years ago.
79433	80874	I went with Jessica, of all people.
81074	81314	Uh-huh.
81674	82075	And, um...
83797	88841	Oddly enough, having two car accidents where your hip gets injured means it's really hard to roller skate.
89981	95665	Especially, you know, when you're going one way and you're having to balance with your right leg and it hurts and ow.
96066	96226	Ow.
96766	98367	So yeah, I murdered myself.
99208	100129	But I played lots of stuff.
101349	103791	We'll talk about that in just a minute, but I have to introduce everybody else who's here.
104051	105732	Say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
106053	106233	Hi.
106553	107594	Hi, how are you doing, Loki?
108014	109135	I'm doing fine.
109775	109995	Yeah?
110015	110476	Fine?
110516	110696	Fine.
112302	115365	I was in Oakland all day, so you can't really recover from that.
132441	133221	We'll see you next time.
159128	171632	If you want to hear everything, you still probably want to watch Justin TV, but actually listen through All Games Radio at www.allgames.com where we tape every Sunday night right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific Time.
171912	173752	Let's introduce other people we have in the studio tonight.
173772	175133	We have some very special guests tonight.
176073	186636	I'm going to start with this guy behind me here who has not been to the show before, but he's someone I've kind of gotten to know a little bit recently and had listened to a few episodes of the show and I was like, well, why don't you come be on the show?
186996	188137	And so say hello to...
188897	189417	Other Matt.
189898	190498	Matt number two.
190558	191059	Matt two.
191199	191399	Yes.
191439	192079	How are you, Matt two?
192279	192700	I'm good.
192760	193240	How are you, Rob?
193360	194581	I'm pretty good.
194621	195401	Thanks for asking.
195501	196062	That's good to know.
196222	198463	So you've actually listened to a couple episodes of the show.
198644	198924	I have.
198964	200085	I'm not an OLR virgin.
200165	201766	And you weren't freaked out.
202126	202986	No, not too badly.
203046	205688	We first met when somebody brought you over to my New Year's party.
206369	208810	We kind of were talking and found out we had some things in common and so on.
209131	211592	But you actually went away and listened to the show and weren't scared off.
211672	213133	You still are talking to me, which is awesome.
213153	216075	The next day, I went to iTunes and I downloaded a recent podcast.
216355	218637	So within 24 hours, I was already listening.
219017	219517	Very cool.
219897	222218	Well, sucker.
222298	223879	Really quickly, what kind of games do you like?
224859	228580	Since you've never been on the show before, we usually like to ask new people, what kind of video games do you play, if any?
229140	229660	I play a few.
230380	232041	Mainly PC gaming for right now.
232381	235442	I do have an Xbox 360, but I mainly do the PC gaming.
236282	238043	Everything from first-person shooter to...
240320	259699	MMORPGs, everything else in between Puzzle games, Prince of Persia, things like that But lately it's been WoW and Rock Band 2 have been dominating my time Nothing wrong with that Nothing wrong with that at all WoW was dominating my time for a little while too Yes Yes, but then I quit But then we have Rock Band 2 I play a lot of as well I have a question for you Okay Do you like old PC games?
260760	261300	What do you mean old?
261360	262121	Are you a fan of Loom?
263120	278628	Never played Loom, but I go back as far as my online gaming experience goes back to X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, X-Wing Alliance, and organizing online gaming clans, if you will, with IRC Chat, and organizing that on the old school MSN Gaming Zone, if you remember that.
278648	279369	Do you ever do MUDs?
280349	280669	Do which?
280870	281290	Do MUDs.
282090	282791	I don't remember MUDs.
283011	283631	Old RPG.
283991	284131	Old?
284512	284892	Old school.
285152	285692	Yeah.
285832	286613	Back in the day, so.
286813	286973	Yeah.
287813	290574	Descent, when Descent was one of the first 3D games.
290694	293855	I remember Descent and having it over 14 floppies.
294295	294796	That's right.
295716	298817	And Doom 2 had 6 floppy 3.5 inch diskettes.
298957	299317	Heck yeah.
299517	300878	I still remember all my cheat codes too.
302321	305624	All right, nerds, we got to introduce somebody else who's here tonight.
306405	311611	Let's say this is somebody you always hear a lot about, but he hasn't been on the show too many times.
311731	315154	But just in time for Valentine's Day, you know what?
315795	318377	I'm going to let Jamie introduce tonight's special guest.
318398	320259	I think Jamie would do a much better job introducing.
320860	322221	This is my personal parasite.
323082	323583	Just kidding.
324898	325298	I'm kidding.
325698	330800	Say hello everybody to Jamie's husband Dan is joining us tonight on the show.
331380	332261	Dan, how are you?
334622	335122	Hi.
335922	340504	Thanks for that wonderful introduction, wife.
341724	346206	Dan is the king of gaming in our house.
346886	349447	He has more knowledge of classic games than I do.
350256	352182	Next time I want Rob to introduce me, by the way.
360297	360898	Street Fighter 4
390277	392459	I prepaid for my $150 fighting stick.
392639	393339	Oh my god.
394000	394860	Yeah, baby.
396081	401405	Well, if you're playing it on Xbox 360, though, you kind of have to have one of those.
401425	409130	Because I'm seriously contemplating getting it on the PlayStation 3 simply because I can't picture playing Street Fighter 4 on the Xbox 360 controller.
409410	410591	I'm getting it on the PlayStation 3.
410851	412612	Not even just because of the controllers.
413072	415134	That's because I'm not going to play fighting games on live.
415814	416274	www.DarkSakura.com
446306	463148	I have the collector's edition pre-ordered I'm going crazy I'm watching the World Warrior on loop I'm watching the Street Fighter cartoon I'm going to watch the anime movie the night before Try working in a game store where we've had nothing but Street Fighter on all the demos for like a month
464295	465716	What kind of game store work do you do?
465837	466377	If you don't mind me asking.
466397	467478	You don't have to say what company or whatever.
467498	470281	I don't know what you can say or can't say, but what kind of game store stuff do you do?
470541	471642	I manage a game crazy.
471823	476567	Anyone who's listened to this show forever knows I used to manage a GameStop.
477268	482954	Now, it's not that there's anything wrong with GameStop, other than the fact that they're corrupt and evil and hate you.
486294	490218	But I jumped to the other side.
490418	492239	So it's not that it's any different.
492600	494962	It's just smaller and hates you less.
495502	499306	And I do want to point out now, tonight, we do have the whiteboard in studio.
499386	504190	So we can now start, finally, our list of things that suck about GameStop.
504210	506132	And I'm going to have Dan starting off the list tonight.
506653	507453	They hate you.
507794	509595	So I'll be writing that on the whiteboard here.
509695	511317	They hate all of us.
511677	512998	We get into our gaming week.
513058	516501	So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
516721	521744	Well, my past two weeks of gaming have been fairly diverse.
523085	531751	I actually finally got past the stupid dialogue portion of Ragnarok DS and actually got to kill four porings.
532292	533833	Ooh, four porings.
535250	536130	Blink, blink, blink.
536610	537391	It's pretty fun so far.
537411	538031	That's really cute.
538431	540312	I'm just like, dude, how do you get to Prontera?
540892	542353	Because that was the only word I could read.
544053	545674	Because I know some Japanese.
545714	546714	I can't read that much kanji.
548075	555617	And then I also finally got through the damn forest on Castlevania Order of Ecclesia.
556698	559599	Because it was exactly what I said I had to do.
560179	561719	One more level and I could do it.
562760	562820	Um...
564161	579956	and then I played, we played R-Type Dimensions last night and I have to say that it's really, really, really freaking sweet especially having unlimited ships because R-Type is like freaking hard.
581057	581477	It's R-Type.
581517	584699	And this is actually harder than I remember R-Type being.
586460	588602	And I wasn't really all that great at R-Type to begin with.
590503	592004	But Dan and I played co-op last night.
592544	593324	It was really fun.
593705	595385	No, it wasn't last night.
595405	596026	It was the night before.
596606	597387	Anyway, it was really fun.
600168	601529	I saw something that depressed me.
602269	604331	I saw the trailer for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.
606095	607436	It's Civil War crap.
607836	609737	We hated it the first time, Marvel.
610038	610578	Stop it.
611719	613860	Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.
614500	615121	It sucked.
615221	616722	It was an awful storyline.
617162	617782	Stop it.
619243	619724	Do you hear me?
620904	621725	I read your Twitters.
621765	622525	I'll tell you all.
623966	625307	So anyway.
626368	629610	And then... What else did I play?
629630	629710	Okay.
631673	636774	Oh yeah, I did actually play some Ragnarok Online for like, you know, an hour, and that was it.
637334	642756	And I also had a minor fangasm over Star Trek Online's character trailer.
643496	644036	That looked hot.
645256	649277	But when it comes out, I'm making the official alien race of OLR.
649977	650738	The OLRians.
652378	652698	Nice.
652838	654459	Are they going to be orange people?
654699	656179	No, probably not.
656459	657219	Orange is a good color.
658139	658379	Copper.
658459	658880	Copper.
660200	660500	Copper.
661590	663590	I insist I don't wear a red shirt.
664891	665631	It depends though.
665971	666551	No, no, no, no, no.
667331	670672	If you are original Star Trek, red shirt is the kiss of death.
671312	675013	If you in Next Generation, yellow is the kiss of death.
676273	677693	If you're Voyager, prepare to suck.
681174	681674	Hey now.
682114	683474	I like Janeway.
683534	684095	I'm the one.
684835	690636	And if you're DS9, it's the most awesome of them all and Enterprise doesn't exist.
692712	693732	Quantum Leap to the Future
719386	720627	I've never heard of Perfect World.
720647	722047	Give us a brief description of what this is.
722648	723628	It's not World of Warcraft.
724269	725409	Oh, well, then I'm sold.
725449	730612	It's the same type of game, though, but it has some pretty gorgeous environments, and it's pretty cool.
730832	732072	And you can actually ride a tiger.
733353	734414	You can ride a white tiger.
735614	737335	I want a white tiger.
737695	740117	Can you get the eye of the tiger?
740337	742938	I've also decided something else completely unrelated to gaming.
743879	744599	I want a pet goat.
744619	745499	She doesn't even acknowledge it.
746180	746600	No, I'm not.
747765	749985	I also decided that I want a pet goat while I was out of town.
750786	753466	You can have my sister's if you want.
753486	753646	Really?
753666	753906	No, she can't.
755587	756267	She has four.
756787	758707	Do they have the cool rectangular pupils?
759908	760508	I don't care.
760548	762908	Wait, in real life, IRL, she wants a goat?
763128	763408	Yes.
765129	766729	Where the hell are you going to put a goat?
766829	767529	In the backyard.
769269	772730	Hey, well, you know, my sister is looking for a place to store her four goats.
772870	774671	I want one goat so I can walk it on a leash.
775391	776711	Well, they suck.
778916	780076	What are you going to do with a goat?
780597	781157	Keep it as a pet!
781177	783798	What, are you going to take it out and walk it around the block?
783838	784158	Yes!
785998	787759	My sister collects animals, apparently.
787779	789820	Are you going to ride it to work?
789840	791080	No, goats are too little to ride.
791920	792560	They suck.
792681	794081	There's nothing cool about goats.
794141	796662	They just eat shit and then shit.
796682	799843	Yeah, they'll eat anything, so I'll just feed it, you know, Jaguar games.
799863	801443	That's all they do.
801964	804664	They just process grass into shit.
805145	806025	That is it.
807012	808494	Dan's Dad's Goats are Cute
828123	832126	No, this week I didn't play hardly anything other than Grand Theft Auto 4.
833808	843215	And I've been prepping my experience of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the PC, putting the right mods in place so that I can go in and hopefully film something funny.
843855	848999	Just a little hint, I found a skin to reskin Niko to look like Adolf Hitler.
852923	853823	Oh, it's going to be fun.
854844	857146	And let's see what else.
858880	866124	Some other mods, like flood stuff and crazy weapons, so it's going to be the wacky world of Adolf Hitler.
868005	869505	Or maybe another Hitler, you know.
869806	870446	Hitler on ice.
870646	872207	Hitler in the Matrix or something, I don't know.
873844	876966	Anyways, can I say some chat comments real quick?
876986	877066	Sure.
877086	878186	Now they're on a goat kick.
879127	884089	Bob Coffee, away, I think, who forgot to change her name to Bob Coffee, because they're obviously there.
884429	887071	Bob Coffee says, zombie goats would be the best thing ever.
887251	889212	That might be like a video game involving zombie goats.
889232	891933	Well, they did have Black Sheep, which was zombie sheep.
891953	894334	That was an awful movie.
894354	897036	They had the trailer for that at the beginning of, was it Death Proof?
898496	899657	And it was actually a real movie?
899677	899757	Yeah.
900660	909900	Actdeft in chat says, sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell I just posted a picture of the goats in chat because I love them
911144	918331	Chat.orange.com My sister seriously has her goat on her Facebook as one of her pictures.
919312	921074	I am not kidding.
921094	922075	She had four of them.
922115	925218	I think she has three now because one of them got attacked by dogs and died.
926840	930423	She has three goats.
930463	932285	This just proves goats suck.
932405	934688	If a bunch of dogs can take out a goat...
935802	936543	Thanks for watching!
953863	956164	It was her boyfriend's dogs, actually.
956744	958005	This is like Animal Farm for reals.
958025	960546	They don't take care of them, and they start going feral.
960946	962907	So that's why they attack the goats.
963588	965048	Anyways, because they're hungry.
965709	970631	So she also has a bunch of birds and hamsters and shit.
970971	972752	She's studying to be a veterinarian, though, right?
972812	974393	So we kind of let her get away with it.
974633	975794	Yeah, but she shouldn't have goats.
975834	976834	She's in an apartment.
976874	979395	She has to store them in Rio Linda.
979415	980116	Yeah.
983305	985946	Which, you know, for Rio Linda, they fit right in.
989427	993288	But anyways... Yes, they do have names.
993308	994489	I don't remember what the names are.
994609	998830	Rio Linda is to Sacramento, as Atmore is to Mobile, Alabama.
999551	1001991	Oh yeah, that's going to help a lot.
1002252	1003452	Okay, it's the boonies of California.
1004286	1006989	Anyways, so yeah, that's my game week.
1007049	1008110	It was just Grand Theft Auto.
1008370	1012895	I meant to download Killzone 2 because I don't have it pre-ordered at GameStop.
1013135	1015958	Oh, how will I ever get the demo that seems to be region free?
1016738	1019361	Maybe I'll create another free account in the UK.
1019821	1020422	Oh no!
1020642	1022784	I've bypassed their security.
1024086	1024446	So yeah.
1026028	1026268	Wow.
1026710	1028472	All right, my gaming week.
1028833	1029814	I don't have a whole lot to share.
1030515	1035501	After last week's show, you might remember Rice Princess was going crazy over the fact that I had the Resident Evil 5 demo.
1035881	1038865	So we actually went in and played the Resident Evil 5 demo, and it was pretty cool.
1038885	1040186	Yes, I'll give my impressions on that.
1040206	1042249	I was just like, eh, that's okay.
1042329	1042549	Okay.
1043730	1044491	Was that your impression?
1044551	1045772	Yeah, it was just like, eh.
1046412	1047553	That's kind of how I felt about it.
1047973	1051176	Resident Evil's not a series I've ever gotten into.
1051216	1053457	I mean, I love zombies and stuff.
1053477	1056780	There's another zombie series, of course, that I really got into that we'll be talking about later.
1057060	1058221	I have to get this off my chest.
1058261	1058601	I'm sorry.
1058641	1060643	I need to stop talking about this because I have to get this off my chest.
1060663	1061803	I've been waiting all night to say this.
1062384	1068789	I played the absolute worst Xbox Live arcade game in my entire freaking life this week.
1068809	1069289	Worse than yours?
1069409	1070709	DarkSakura
1085994	1089375	Oh my god, this game was awful.
1089995	1091376	Wasn't that actually a TV show?
1091396	1092456	It is a TV show.
1093296	1097997	I hope it got cancelled like five times because the setup of the show was stupid.
1098497	1100738	The AI in the game was stupid.
1100898	1104019	If they got an answer wrong, they would misspell words.
1104079	1109060	I didn't even understand how the game worked and the clues were terrible.
1109460	1110920	Oh my god, this game was awful.
1111000	1113021	I felt myself slowly dying.
1113581	1114102	Thanks for watching!
1137023	1137943	I know, for real, right?
1137963	1139263	Bring us some good game shows.
1139564	1140104	I know, right?
1141164	1149365	Frisbee in chat says, this game, S-U-C blank S. Exactly how I feel.
1149385	1151746	I wouldn't even be upset if they brought back Bumper Stumpers.
1153406	1157547	Bumper Stumpers was kind of like, how can you have Bumper Stumpers go on and on and on forever?
1157727	1158307	It was great.
1158947	1159467	All right, forget it.
1159507	1159747	Anyway.
1160328	1161348	I demand that they bring a...
1163086	1178551	Game of Double Dare VXJasonXV in chat says The game show itself is interesting Games based off of game shows tend to suck though Look, I would rather play the Are you smarter than a 5th grader game All day long Than have to play 5 minutes of Merv Griffin's Crosswords ever again
1179071	1180891	Yeah, with zombie Jeff Foxworthy.
1181031	1187013	I don't even... Actually, all things considered, the Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader game wasn't bad.
1187613	1189954	I mean, for what it is, you know what it is.
1190014	1191494	It's an adaptation of the TV show.
1191514	1193274	If you don't like the TV show, then whatever.
1193294	1194395	You're probably not going to like the game.
1194435	1196935	For what it is, that live game is not bad.
1197315	1199676	But this game was just not fun at all.
1200556	1200916	at all.
1201296	1203157	Maybe because you weren't a fan of the TV show?
1203638	1204858	I never watched the TV show.
1204898	1207019	I loved the Scrabble show back in the day.
1207420	1208880	I like word game shows.
1208920	1211242	What other word... The Scrabble show was awesome.
1211302	1211742	Lingo.
1211962	1212642	I love Lingo.
1213182	1216564	These are two games I would rather see on Xbox Live than Murder, Grim, and Traverse.
1216784	1222567	You should have a game that you're an audience member at one of these shows, and you can yell at the contestants and get them to do stuff.
1222887	1224868	But it may or may not affect the answers.
1224888	1229551	This whole 1 vs. 100 thing that's coming to Xbox Live or whatever that... What are they calling that?
1229591	1229931	The whole...
1230151	1231112	Thanks for watching!
1251007	1251948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1273290	1276092	and Deekman in chat says, did you mention Left 4 Dead?
1276232	1278213	I did check out Left 4 Dead finally.
1278493	1283355	One of our listeners was very, very kind and gave... I guess they bought a four-pack together but only used three of the codes.
1283676	1284656	So they gave me a code.
1284696	1285677	I was very, very thankful.
1286297	1289398	And I did check out the game for a little bit but not enough to give impressions yet.
1289779	1291239	I haven't played enough at all.
1291980	1293501	I got raped in like five minutes.
1293541	1295862	That's how horrible I am at first-person shooters, okay?
1296242	1300924	Like, I was going down the stairs and then some big fat guy comes down the stairs and rapes us all because I don't know what I'm doing.
1301004	1301205	So I...
1302225	1303706	I'm just a big square and I play a little bit of WoW.
1303726	1304107	I'm on that ever...
1328149	1329890	LongQuest to hit 80, because I'm a noob.
1330450	1331830	But you have like 20 characters!
1331910	1333091	I do not have 20 characters.
1333291	1337852	I have one of every class on Narzul, which is my main server.
1338592	1342374	And it's funny, because we do have Trekkie nerds on the show tonight, and I think every time.
1343354	1347515	Most of my characters are named after what I have affectionately called obscure Star Trek characters.
1348595	1356518	So, for example, Kes, Seska, Neelix, Gumtu, Darmok, and if you're a Trekkie, you recognize hopefully a handful of those.
1357071	1385352	my main mages I recognize two of them as Voyager names that's right Darmok and Jameelix was really obscure he was on for like six seasons he cooked but he cooked and he didn't he was a main character he was in the opening credits he was on Voyager he was a morale officer Voyager was awesome he was a morale officer that became a security guy under Tuvok anyway so obscure because you never really think of it you think of Janeway you think of Trekkies 3 yeah Trekkies 3 exactly what's that?
1386690	1388251	I have to ask, do you like Warp 11?
1388911	1389071	No.
1390112	1390532	Sadness.
1390632	1391092	I'm sorry.
1392793	1398656	My main mage is Malak, but I had to rename him to Valerian since someone took the name when I had the transfer service.
1399136	1409062	Hopefully one day Valerian will be 80, and then I will have to work on my other, as Rob calls them, 20 characters.
1409582	1413064	Bob Coffee in chat says, I recognize all of those I fail at life, lol.
1413964	1415525	We both fail at life, lol squared.
1416581	1417362	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1441348	1442709	Dan, how was your gaming week?
1442729	1443669	What kind of stuff have you been playing?
1443809	1444329	It was awesome.
1445090	1453654	I pulled down HD Remix, the Super Street Fighter Turbo HD Remix, and at first I played the demo and I was like, ah, super janky, no thanks.
1454374	1457316	But as Street Fighter Mania gripped me, it was like, okay, I'll download it.
1457616	1459837	And it's actually not too bad.
1459977	1462778	It's a little bit easier than Super Turbo is normally, so that's pretty awesome.
1462838	1466680	See, Rob, these are the people that encourage this kind of behavior, re-releasing games.
1466820	1467120	I know.
1467701	1470342	Oh, I'm terrible, because I also downloaded R-Type Dimensions.
1471618	1473261	Which was... It kicked ass.
1473962	1474283	You know.
1474463	1477228	And I've got... I've got the remake of Bionic Manor.
1477789	1478831	I'm a remake whore.
1479071	1481976	Seriously, if it's a good remake, if it's a game that needs to be remade... Some of them are really good.
1481996	1482858	The Bionic Manor... I mean...
1486357	1491203	I fully say remake it, but you gotta be real faithful and real respectful of the original material.
1503539	1509485	R-Type, I'm not really sure if they changed anything to it, but Street Fighter, they just made the sprites prettier.
1509505	1511467	Well, that was basically what they did with R-Type.
1511647	1513348	I mean, it's R-Type 1, R-Type 2.
1513628	1514770	It's got the 3D graphics.
1514810	1519033	They added a two-player simultaneous mode, which was actually kind of interesting.
1519114	1525800	But if you're an R-Type god and you could blaze through the whole game with no problem, yeah, it's still just R-Type.
1525840	1528202	You are an R-Type god, though, from what I remember Jamie saying.
1528342	1538968	Yeah, I could totally dust, like, the first three levels of R-Type 1, then you get to level 4 when the game gets hard, and I mean, I don't care who you are, R-Type gets real, real hard.
1539008	1543631	I could beat it on the consoles, but this, R-Type Dimensions is a hard version of R-Type.
1543711	1555938	I don't know if your hitbox in that game is bigger or what, but, you know, there's a lot of shooters and stuff that deserve remakes, and so, I do encourage that, you know, as long as it's respectful to the original game, and it's a game that needs it, you know.
1556792	1558173	TigerClaw in chat makes a good case.
1558193	1560294	He says, Bionic Commando remake was awesome.
1560334	1562556	You get the Hitler head explosion in full 3D.
1562776	1563216	True that.
1564537	1565078	That is true.
1565598	1565978	Very true.
1567079	1572022	Alright, we're going to go ahead and get into some housekeeping tonight real quick, and then we'll finally get into some gaming news.
1572122	1572803	Hold on, hold on.
1573003	1573223	Oh, what?
1573243	1574204	I have a few more things I want to add.
1574284	1574504	No.
1574984	1575204	Yes.
1576945	1577806	What the hell?
1577906	1580528	Okay, I don't think we're talking about this tonight, so I'm going to mention it anyways.
1581567	1583547	The Warriors on Xbox Live Arcade
1609704	1610765	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1629997	1630637	Oh yeah, definitely.
1630657	1632599	I think actually it's already coming, the gaming.
1632979	1637301	They're going to show that off at E3 this year with Avatar by Ubisoft.
1637501	1638842	It's going to be in 3D as well.
1639182	1646467	And I wouldn't be surprised if it's polarized because that would make sense to me because it doesn't look that bad when you're not looking at it without the glasses.
1647427	1648848	Because I was really surprised before.
1649068	1657733	I'm just used to either the really weird blurry glasses or the red and blue stuff.
1657853	1658074	I mean...
1659088	1660909	So, you know, old school 3D stuff.
1661469	1665832	But, I mean, the polarized glasses, it was weird because I put them on and I thought, oh, this is going to hurt my eyes and stuff.
1665852	1668453	I'm like, wow, it's just looking like through normal glasses.
1668514	1670675	But then, you know, the effect on the screen is really awesome.
1670915	1671956	Well, a question for you.
1671976	1676138	Do you ever, I think it's on the WiimoteHack website.
1676558	1681101	There was the guy who did sort of the reverse by using the infrared sensors.
1681141	1683162	Yeah, the, I forget what they call it.
1683182	1684703	Yeah, I haven't done that just yet.
1686007	1686567	I don't know.
1686627	1688428	I can't get my Bluetooth stuff to work right.
1688568	1693569	But I mean you can see the full 3D effect even just watching a video of it.
1693669	1696630	They should do something that would utilize that type of technology.
1696650	1706573	Well they were supposed to in Boom Blocks if you remember the developers wanted to do that but they somehow someone said no and they had to take it out.
1706593	1707073	That's crazy.
1707093	1709654	Because there was going to be a little Easter egg in there where you could do it that way.
1710394	1711275	I forget what they called it.
1712075	1712175	Um
1713728	1718352	I know Trackmania does some sort of 3D thing.
1718372	1723476	I don't know if it's with the red-blue glasses or if it's the polarized glasses, but that would be fun.
1724297	1725538	Because Trackmania is a sweet game.
1726599	1727580	But that's it.
1727940	1728120	Sorry.
1729966	1730887	No, that's alright, that's alright.
1731567	1733669	Let's talk about, really quickly, housekeeping.
1733689	1735730	I pretty much said all I wanted to say about the new website.
1735790	1739432	Hopefully that will go live for everybody, not just during the show, but everybody will get to see that.
1739472	1742054	Hopefully in the next week or two, it's going to be awesome.
1742755	1744516	Regular content, again, I'm so excited.
1744556	1746097	We can actually do reviews and all that fun stuff.
1746117	1746477	It'll be great.
1747538	1755763	Otherwise, just make sure to keep following us on MySpace and Facebook, at the Oil Army on Facebook, and LiveJournal as well at Orange Lounge.
1756123	1756644	What, Loki?
1756744	1759145	I was just thinking, because it is sort of housekeeping.
1759946	1762048	I hope I can get in.
1780089	1782790	Special guests in is going to be difficult, but we'll see.
1783710	1793894	Anyways, possibly this year we will have Nelly coming in to do her Woman That Hates Gaming review of E3.
1796054	1798015	Because we're going to go there for a couple days.
1798195	1801916	We're actually going to a trip for Disneyland as well.
1801976	1804157	Because E3 happens to fall on her birthday.
1804377	1806798	So she said, you know, I'm going to be...
1807782	1813691	you know very loving and I'm gonna I'll go with you you you can go to E3 you know
1814777	1838781	and all you know as long as we go to you know Disneyland stuff so I'm fine with that and go in the E3 maybe a day or two or something like that I'm very excited to get the wife that hates gaming interviews it's gonna be amazing all right so we'll see we'll see all right anyhow let's get into some gaming news like a half hour into the show and haven't gotten to gaming news yet so Loki please take it away all right well speaking of E3 um the exhibitor list has been revealed and uh
1839721	1844963	Some people that had dropped out before are back, including Activision Blizzard.
1846304	1848625	They are back after dropping out of the last E3.
1848645	1849545	But, I mean, who can blame them?
1849565	1852786	The last E3 was kind of... I don't know.
1855127	1856828	But it's interesting, though.
1856988	1864411	Even though Activision Blizzard may be there, the Blizzard portion of Activision will not be there.
1865792	1866352	But, I mean...
1867897	1874638	I guess they did have a few things they could have shown off, like Diablo 3 and StarCraft 2, but I don't know.
1874958	1880880	I mean, I don't really know when all that stuff is supposed to come out, so they don't really necessarily need to show that, I guess.
1881300	1883960	What does Activision have that you want to see without Blizzard?
1884440	1885100	Without Blizzard?
1885120	1886321	Blizzard has everything.
1887581	1891061	They've got StarCraft, they've got Diablo, they've got whatever's next for WarCraft.
1891101	1893382	Activision's like, well, we've got Guitar Hero!
1894170	1896613	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
1911906	1917150	It's the new Tony Hawk game where they're going to have an actual skateboard that you use for the game.
1917210	1918811	So that'll be interesting.
1919031	1920852	Something else they can try to sell us for $200.
1921092	1921653	Exactly.
1923034	1927296	Maybe you'll see what they're going to do to innovate with Guitar Hero.
1928878	1938284	And then maybe Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and possibly the new Transformers game just to see if it's really sucky or not.
1938504	1941406	Well, hey, I know the first game blew, okay?
1941426	1943848	Did you watch the trailer that's up on Kotaku for it?
1943888	1946270	Yes, and it doesn't look any better than the first game.
1946610	1948552	But it's a different developer, okay?
1948612	1949452	It doesn't matter.
1949612	1950533	It's a movie game.
1950633	1951474	It's going to suck.
1951754	1954136	It'll be bad in a different way, and not all movie games suck.
1954156	1954776	Oh, wonderful.
1955137	1955797	Thank you.
1958179	1960681	Okay, Wanted looks awesome, and that's going to be a movie game.
1961041	1963963	Yeah, but it's not going to be awesome.
1964083	1966125	You're watching a trailer, and you're like, ooh, that looks like it might be good.
1967355	1971718	Okay, yeah, Transformers, the new game trailer, there was nothing that said, I'm going to buy this.
1971818	1974100	It's just kind of, I mean, look at it.
1974420	1976841	If you even spend money to rent that game, you're high.
1979183	1983146	It's for seven-year-old boys who love the movie and have to keep on living it.
1983506	1984627	It's not for gamers.
1984927	1986868	But I want to keep on living the movie.
1987108	1987529	Fine.
1988729	1990110	Pirate it like the rest of us.
1990711	1991171	Okay.
1993052	1995434	But seriously, Activision has got nothing without Blizzard.
1996539	1997060	Thanks for watching!
2017682	2019163	Yes, and it sucks.
2019243	2026626	Okay, it started off as a port of the GameCube game, and they fucked that up, and so they made it into this new game where they renamed it, and it still sucked.
2026766	2032129	Man, speaking of porting GameCube games, who's not bitter that Pikmin is just the GameCube version with Wii controls?
2033857	2034117	DarkSakura,
2055954	2058395	Even if it's just GX, because that game was brutal.
2058415	2060997	That better be the secret in Reggie's pants at E3.
2061917	2067100	That's what they should be doing as one of the new play control games.
2067220	2072762	Falcon Punch!
2072782	2077024	Seriously, they should do a new play control version of F-Zero GX, because that would be perfect.
2077064	2084428	But instead of this Mario Power Tennis, really, was that such a great game that it requires... Mario Power Tennis was pretty pimp.
2085970	2087312	And come on, like Strikers?
2087472	2088373	Strikers is awesome.
2089034	2092277	Mario's aggressive death soccer is like the best game to ever happen.
2093158	2096722	I still, still can't, you know, believe that that game is that good.
2097743	2099285	I hate soccer, but I love that game.
2100206	2100567	Sorry, it...
2102193	2108476	I can't get that mental image now of Reggie Fils-Aimé coming out at E3 and Falcon punching us with his cock.
2112898	2120581	I issue a challenge now to our listeners, especially the ones who were kind enough to do the Kutaragi Crayon eating picture.
2121702	2122182	No, no.
2122482	2123202	Don't make a picture.
2123222	2125203	We now want the Falcon punch picture.
2125423	2127104	No, no.
2127164	2129825	I will send someone a shiny silver dollar.
2130025	2130666	Keep it clean.
2131366	2131666	All right.
2133399	2134659	That I write on in Sharpie.
2135280	2136420	This is Falcon Punch.
2136680	2140461	Let's move on to something depressing to try and sedate the show a little bit here.
2141141	2144842	Sadly, THQ has laid off about 100 people on their staff.
2145582	2147163	Sad trombone.
2147243	2150524	Yeah, sad trombone, but it was the mobile gaming division.
2150904	2152844	And I don't mean to sound crass.
2152964	2155205	I feel sorry for those people.
2155245	2158446	It sucks to lose jobs and stuff, and the economy stinks and everything, but...
2159306	2159666	You know.
2160067	2162268	Does THQ make anything besides SmackDown?
2162928	2169252	Yeah, they make a bunch of Spongebob and Nintendo licensed games and Saints Row 2, which I love.
2169272	2170333	Oh yeah, they did make Saints Row 2.
2170513	2171674	That game was not so bad.
2172279	2173319	Anyhow, well, here's the thing.
2173419	2176560	They are actually going to be restructuring the wireless subsidiary.
2177060	2183281	Apparently, though, they actually closed completely the San Diego mobile studio as well and some offices in UK and Germany.
2184101	2187102	They are still going to be cranking out some wireless games, though, out of Finland.
2187182	2189522	They're Uni Versomo Studios.
2189803	2194584	And I guess this means, I don't know, more Worms Mobile, things of that sort.
2194644	2196984	They did a mobile version of Saints Row.
2197024	2198364	I don't think it was any good, though.
2199805	2200125	I don't know.
2200145	2201905	If they did, like, Worms World Party...
2203168	2203448	DarkSakura
2228556	2229416	Yes, we will.
2229537	2230557	Who likes Netflix?
2230917	2231237	Me.
2231918	2237300	I have watched seasons 1 and 2 of 30 Rock on Netflix on demand on the Xbox 360.
2237380	2237980	It's great.
2238181	2251407	See, speaking of Netflix on the Xbox 360, they did a survey that went out to a few members that was asking them if they would pay a little bit extra for premium content like from cable channels like HBO.
2252347	2256949	And it's sort of, I guess, rumored that it's going to be around $10 extra.
2259110	2260151	Don't encourage them.
2262033	2263574	But, um, I don't know.
2263594	2265236	I think some people would be excited by it.
2265796	2266957	Nobody will be excited by it.
2266977	2268159	There are consumer whores.
2268539	2272002	Look, I like the idea of offering some more of this premium content.
2272022	2275866	Like, being able to watch the tutors on demand and all this kind of stuff sounds kind of awesome.
2275886	2276807	Because I like...
2278024	2278905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2297185	2305993	but independent documentaries about strippers that went to stripping because of Hurricane Katrina which yes is an actual documentary I once watched on Netflix 360.
2306213	2308435	That's all that's going to be left is Hurricane Stripping.
2308676	2309877	Premium content, good.
2310177	2312439	Paying more, bad.
2312879	2318625	It's already $9 a month for like the super basic level with the unlimited streaming which is great through the Xbox.
2318665	2319065	I love it.
2319265	2319385	It's...
2320166	2320686	It's awesome.
2320726	2324348	It's got me watching more TV than ever, which is, you know, really what society needed.
2324849	2328991	But at the same time, it's like, oh man, don't give them any reason to charge us more.
2330672	2331832	It's given us Doctor Who.
2332813	2334254	We've got up to season four now, right?
2334474	2334654	No.
2334914	2335074	No?
2335514	2338676	Not only don't we have season four, but we're not paying extra for it.
2338696	2339857	It just came with the next season.
2341301	2355787	I'd be curious if you sign up for premium membership at Takeaway Subscribership from HBO, Cinemax, all that stuff, from cable subscribers, because now they can just download for a whole lot cheaper the main shows like Big Love, Tudors, other Sopranos from back in the day, those types of shows.
2355827	2358048	I'm curious about the Takeaway Subscribership.
2359141	2365062	That's a good question, but I wonder if they would care, because they're still getting money from you watching their shows, so maybe they don't care.
2365222	2366442	They still get their money one way or another.
2366622	2368803	That's true, or the cable companies are maybe losing revenue.
2368943	2370243	I don't know about the hell with them.
2370343	2377384	I'm sure that Netflix is actually paying a certain percentage to the premium channels for content.
2378004	2381345	I mean, that would make sense, or else HBO would be like, bitch, please.
2382145	2386866	Well, they pay a licensing fee for the movies that they use, but I mean...
2387967	2393830	It's not like they're going to show The Sopranos every night after it comes on like they do CSI.
2394610	2397151	Xlink in chatroom says, gives a very honest response.
2397211	2398632	This is why I torrent.
2398792	2401854	It's a very honest response, whether legality is questionable or whatever.
2403794	2405475	Well, Dan says, why pay for what I can steal?
2405535	2407376	But also, there's something to be said.
2407696	2408497	Just like iTunes.
2408617	2411778	Why do people actually use iTunes when you can go out and find the downloaded MP3?
2411998	2414660	Because sometimes it's a pain in the ass to find the actual MP3.
2414680	2415220	Because I have an iPhone.
2415740	2421983	Well, and the fact, how convenient is it that you can just sit there, tap a button, and you will have the full song for just a buck.
2422143	2422763	And it's legal.
2422903	2426624	And you get the warm fuzzies, legal, supporting the artist, all that stuff.
2426684	2429325	I get the warm fuzzies doing the opposite.
2430066	2430826	Well, you're evil.
2430946	2432227	That's because you're a prevert.
2432487	2432767	Alright.
2433027	2433807	Okay, that's not true.
2433927	2435348	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
2436218	2440321	Netflix isn't really gaming, but at the same time, that's what people use their 360s for lately.
2440341	2440922	At least I do.
2441242	2443104	One million subscribers.
2443304	2444145	I spend more time on my 360.
2444705	2449109	Seriously, if you look what I've done the past week, on the 360, I played that horrible Crosswords game.
2449629	2451911	I played Netflix.
2452411	2455694	My PlayStation 3 is actually where I've been gaming lately because I have Prince of Persia on PS3.
2455754	2457055	I've been playing that and LittleBigPlanet.
2457075	2457936	I've been playing the hell out of.
2458416	2459717	That's been my...
2460658	2474436	PS3 I'm actually using my which is weird because I always thought PS3 was supposed to be the system that was going to be my all-in-one entertainment center but like I'm the complete opposite lately I don't know what the hell's up with that I use my PS3 for streaming stuff it works pretty well
2474915	2475536	Alright, who cares?
2475556	2477037	Anyway, let's move on with gaming news.
2478378	2481180	So, Gauntlet DS is potentially cancelled.
2481720	2488906	And this is coming from, I guess, various retail sites that have been telling their customers they had a pre-order that's been cancelled.
2489446	2494570	That it's been removed off of GameStop and some other retail websites.
2495090	2499834	So, well, I know from a distributor's standpoint, I think it was...
2501478	2511023	It was locked and basically put out of print, which either means that it's got a to-be-announced release date, or actually it's cancelled.
2511903	2513924	So, it's pretty much cancelled.
2514465	2515845	Could it possibly be in limo?
2516105	2518227	Like, might the game be changing hands or something?
2518467	2518927	It could be.
2519267	2520288	It happens a lot.
2520448	2524550	In fact, with Midway going through all the problems it's been having too, you know.
2525190	2528592	Thank you for reminding me too, that that was something I gotta touch on
2529918	2532560	Anything four player on the DS would be really cool.
2532580	2536862	Anything that you're waiting for from Midway, don't hold your breath.
2556435	2558216	It pains me to say it because I love Midway.
2558436	2559056	Me too.
2559616	2565259	I love Mortal Kombat and a lot of their IPs, but that company is boned.
2566359	2567459	It is too bad.
2567499	2570180	They owe twice what their company is worth.
2570220	2580404	The only solace that you'll get is the fact that probably the big studios that they own and the franchises will be snapped up by bigger, probably more stable companies.
2580644	2581665	They'll all belong to EA.
2582365	2589707	and, uh, or ActaBlizzard, uh, before, uh, before it's all over, but Midway is, is going down the tubes.
2589847	2594488	You gotta wonder how much Midway lost on that, uh, Strang, what was that, Stranglehold or whatever that game was?
2594888	2601989	They brought in that big, huge name director and they spent all this money marketing it and I didn't, I think the game made a, a poop when it landed, you know?
2602009	2606370	It's not just Stranglehold, they've just had flop after flop after flop and...
2607376	2607936	It's tough.
2608056	2611118	They have all these great franchises and they would try to bring them back.
2611158	2613719	They did Spy Hunter for the PS2 back in the day.
2614120	2615220	And Spy Hunter was great.
2615580	2617121	So they're like, oh man, we'll do Defender.
2617161	2619062	Defender wasn't a bad game, but nobody cared.
2619342	2621283	And their Treasures collections are awesome.
2621323	2625686	The Midway Treasure collections they did on Xbox, like the 20 old games, like Rampage.
2625806	2627206	Yeah, they sell hand over fist.
2627267	2629087	You gotta wonder how they could be in that much trouble.
2629248	2635631	I guess the development budgets on their not whoring out their old franchises have just been out of control.
2635651	2635731	Yeah.
2636211	2640615	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is kind of their last hurrah, I think
2653428	2656890	The DS isn't the most powerful wireless networking device.
2657391	2657871	I don't know.
2659393	2662535	They said they had it working, or maybe they couldn't get it working.
2664217	2665878	If they could make it work.
2666999	2669621	I don't really see how much you're going to need voice for Gauntlet.
2670362	2675066	I mean, it's nice, but it's Gauntlet.
2675106	2676407	Hit that thing with an axe!
2676848	2677148	Quick!
2678669	2679470	Grab the treasure!
2680909	2681856	No, my treasure!
2681956	2682641	Quit dying!
2682843	2683669	Elf shot the food.
2691206	2692747	Call it, people!
2692787	2694028	It's not that complex!
2713348	2715809	It's a Lego-based strategy game, basically.
2716109	2719230	And I think Loki's kind of talked about this a little bit on the show before.
2719310	2719630	Really?
2719650	2720530	Did I?
2720550	2726012	But it's officially now out there that you're going to be having bases that you're building and defending.
2726352	2730133	It's Lego castles, Lego's pirates, Lego's space-themed.
2730713	2735415	You're going to have units that you can actually have pirates and space people in the same team.
2735655	2736975	So you can mix and match all this stuff.
2736995	2738636	Until there's Lego ninjas, it just don't matter.
2739016	2746009	Well, actually, apparently, in the press release, you can have pirate swordsmen fighting wizards and aliens, dragons battling ninjas.
2746792	2749073	and that's going to be the greatest LEGO game to ever happen.
2749314	2754877	And pirate ships launching broadsides against spacecraft and knights.
2755417	2757718	And you can also play this game local multiplayer.
2757779	2759239	Sadly, no VIP.
2759279	2760940	Pirate ship fighting a spaceship.
2760960	2761921	That's just ridiculous.
2762461	2763802	I mean, seriously.
2763862	2765783	What's a pirate ship got cannons and shit?
2765803	2768965	The spaceship's like, I'm just going to fly higher, bitch.
2769285	2769926	Oh, you're dead.
2770686	2773548	They need to make a game like this, but like not LEGOs.
2774113	2800636	you need to go old school and get like the Blacktron Legos in there no offense against the Legos but I want to see like dragons versus spaceships for real I want fucking Duplo in this shit Duplo would totally dominate because they'd just be giant indestructible blocks it'd be like tech level low but resistance is like super high and cost well cost of anything Lego is just through the roof
2801414	2803435	Boy, it's like Construction Fighter.
2803635	2805196	Lego versus Mega Bloks.
2805276	2808237	Legos and Duplos and Tinker Toys and Lincoln Logs.
2808257	2810918	Have you seen the Mega Blok Halo toys that they're doing?
2810938	2812358	Uh-uh.
2812398	2816280	You can get like Warthogs and Scorpion Tanks and stuff all made with Mega Bloks.
2817541	2819721	There's a franchise that someone should have jumped on.
2819881	2823283	I know it was April Fool's joke, but Lego Halo would have been sweet.
2824623	2829105	The chat room is talking about like a Lego fighting game, and the Rob D says you could lose parts as you fight.
2829165	2829785	That would be fun.
2830726	2830946	Yeah.
2832199	2833840	Just knock the blocks off of somebody.
2834200	2834621	It'll be fun.
2834881	2840485	Lego Street Fighter.
2840525	2844988	Speaking of Legos, did you see the pictures someone did of the StarCraft II?
2845548	2846369	Yeah.
2847210	2848350	That person is my hero.
2848811	2850532	That was the most awesome thing I've ever seen.
2851793	2852213	Very cool.
2852954	2857677	Alright, so Lego Battles coming to the DS, I believe the release date is summertime, so we'll see.
2858237	2858438	April.
2859438	2859678	April.
2859839	2860939	That's in time for my birthday.
2861059	2861260	Nice.
2863098	2864698	Ninjas and Dragons on Jamie's birthday.
2864718	2865458	Who could ask for more?
2866159	2866559	Rock.
2867679	2870659	Well, for our UK friends, I'm so sorry.
2871479	2873800	It's just that this game is coming out as making me laugh.
2874540	2888663	They're bringing out a Coronation Street game on the DS, which is sort of like, as far as I know, it's sort of like a weird soap opera-y type show out there, kind of like, what is it, the other one, EastEnders, I think?
2889723	2889923	What?
2890663	2890923	You look...
2894952	2897117	That wasn't on the mic.
2897578	2901688	Dan didn't say it in the mic so you guys didn't hear it, but he went way to cover the gaming news that matters.
2902910	2904394	We have listeners in the UK.
2904414	2904755	I know, I know.
2905228	2912274	I also want to point out when Loki reads release dates, he reads things like Imagine Teacher and Imagine Babies Dance Party.
2912294	2913875	Hey, I want to cover everything.
2914816	2916017	So we have to cover everything.
2916037	2917458	So we can make fun of it.
2918419	2924744	There would be a hundred more people interested in what she's talking about than imagine, you know, sitting around and fucking yourself.
2924764	2925464	Because you know what?
2926624	2931413	If we were going to read release dates that mattered to me, we wouldn't be reading anything.
2932074	2933757	Can I do my story, please?
2933817	2934659	Yes, you may.
2935680	2938025	This is the official STFU from me.
2938125	2938546	Thank you.
2940160	2944483	Anyway, yeah, Coronation Street is really, really popular.
2944523	2947524	It has 78% of the UK's television audience.
2948825	2953088	So basically, it's like, if you're going to watch TV and it's on, that's the only thing to watch, I guess.
2954408	2964254	But they're doing a DS game by, I don't really know too much about what's going into the game exactly as far as the play of it will be.
2964794	2968997	But it's supposed to be out for Christmas this year, so...
2970851	2973171	Yay, you get Coronation Street.
2974872	2976512	Oh, they should do a little Britain DS game.
2977152	2980253	That PlayStation 2 one was awful.
2980513	2982473	Yeah, they did a PSP and PS2 game.
2984634	2984874	What?
2985674	2986674	Do not want.
2986774	2991695	I think that Top Gear and Doctor Who are the only things that justify the continued existence of the BBC.
2993515	2995135	Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.
2995856	2997076	Torchwood and the Sarah Jane Adventures.
2997836	2998396	Whatever that is.
2999159	3000239	Oh, and Primeval.
3001540	3002440	Is Primeval still on?
3003881	3005021	Primeval, that's a good show.
3006382	3007182	No, I haven't seen Primeval.
3007462	3013024	The new series after Life on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, that's pretty decent.
3013645	3014145	It is, yes.
3014945	3017546	So there's actually lots of good stuff on BBC.
3018366	3020547	But it really is about Doctor Who.
3020567	3024048	The staple of British television, in my opinion.
3024969	3025229	And Top Gear.
3025249	3025469	Top Gear.
3029982	3054976	going from something on the BBC to something that's very American Godfather 2 EA has delayed the release of the game because apparently releasing Godfather 2 on the same day as Killzone 2 not a good idea so they decided to hold it off a little bit I believe now it's coming out the second quarter beginning of April probably
3056812	3057672	So, cool.
3057852	3058233	I don't know.
3058253	3059613	I'm not too excited about Godfather.
3059653	3060734	I didn't play the first one.
3060914	3064735	I mean, it's my type of game because it is like a Grand Theft Auto sandbox type of thing.
3064956	3066876	You owe it to yourself to pick it up and try it.
3067077	3074900	It actually is a pretty sick game as long as you don't get too much respect because then you stop being able to shake the crap out of people and make them bend your will.
3076449	3080792	You can just walk into a store and grab the dude and beat him up until he gives you what you want.
3080832	3082113	You'd be like, oh, that's awesome.
3083073	3083513	Sweet.
3083593	3093379	See, I'm wondering if Godfather 2, because I haven't read much about it, if it takes place further in the past, like when Vito Corleone was a kid, or if it's going to be just like, oh, there's more Godfather.
3093419	3095000	I think it's a continuation.
3095221	3096641	That's not as cool.
3097262	3100784	And they basically have now online multiplayer as well.
3101164	3102465	Yeah, that's probably mostly...
3104255	3105616	Mostly the whole attraction.
3106196	3107217	Multiplayer would be fun, though.
3107337	3108618	Then you can slap your friends.
3109398	3110639	I want a Scarface, too.
3110759	3114981	I know they did Scarface, and it was kind of like, oh, he didn't die.
3115962	3119103	He didn't die, and he did it all again because he was so happy the first time.
3119123	3121765	I told him a tenner, and I'm an idiot.
3122766	3123306	Jesus.
3125575	3126476	All right.
3126836	3130279	As long as this time when they do the portable versions, they don't make them into strategy games.
3130699	3134402	Because seriously, everyone comes to my store and wants to buy the portable Scarface game.
3134422	3135642	And I'm like, fine, buy it.
3135943	3137304	Then they bring it back like 10 minutes later.
3137324	3138144	What is this crap?
3138224	3139145	It's a strategy game.
3139946	3141907	But I wanted to run around and shoot people.
3142568	3143368	I'm talking right now.
3146771	3150113	This is why people need to read the reviews and look at the back of the box.
3150513	3151134	Dumbasses.
3152775	3153636	All we have is a disc.
3154955	3155855	Look at the back of the disc.
3157036	3161357	I'm saying in general, Dan, and people, you can look online and find reviews.
3163137	3168638	I think it's a safe assumption that if the box looks the same and it's on the PS2 and the PSP, it should be largely the same game.
3169679	3170119	But it's not.
3170459	3170919	So you're right.
3172059	3174680	Oh, and I was going to say too, I mean, we shouldn't, you know...
3175905	3192638	I'd be harking too much on the UK for having a TV drama being turned into a game because after all Ubisoft is bringing out Grey's Anatomy for the DS and the Wii It's better to play a trauma center It is supposed to play a trauma center but with more drama Aren't they downsizing that team?
3192658	3204928	Good developers are getting fired Sadly there's an audience for that too There are plenty of people that will probably buy that game I sold one copy of Hell's Kitchen on the Wii Once
3206951	3208493	There's not an audience for that.
3208553	3211215	I mean, unless they're buying it somewhere besides game stores.
3211596	3212336	It's terrible.
3212356	3214518	Why are they making all this crap?
3214819	3216320	I like cooking and yelling.
3216400	3219162	Honestly, the Nintendo Wii, and you heard it here.
3219222	3221905	If you're listening, one of the dozens and dozens of listeners on Orange Lounge Radio.
3222325	3225248	If you're listening, I'm saying it now.
3225508	3228431	The Nintendo Wii is going to cause gaming Armageddon.
3230214	3231876	It's the return of the Atari 2600.
3232216	3233097	It's shovelware.
3233338	3236501	They're putting anything they can on it to try to make a quick buck.
3236521	3237983	Come on, they're making Grey's Anatomy.
3239193	3239674	No!
3240254	3240995	That's terrible.
3241135	3242616	It will probably be better than E.T.
3242636	3244078	The Nintendo DS is probably that too.
3244178	3246260	It will probably still be better than E.T.
3246800	3249223	I don't know.
3249283	3250924	Really, if you played E.T.
3250944	3255509	when that game came out on Atari, it had music and the character was animated.
3255889	3260133	And when you were young and you didn't understand, it didn't suck that bad.
3260653	3262275	All the people who bag on E.T.
3262335	3264297	now never even played it.
3264457	3265738	I did play it.
3265798	3268180	I fell in the hole 50 gazillion times.
3268420	3270282	It's because you suck at video games.
3271282	3271823	Seriously.
3272263	3272684	E.T.
3272944	3274145	was not that bad a game.
3274325	3275686	Yes, Atari was arrogant.
3276026	3279949	Yes, they made more copies than there were 2600s, which is terrible.
3280049	3281370	Give, give, give.
3282491	3282772	Dan.
3285534	3285934	We get it.
3287495	3287916	No, no, no.
3287936	3288636	Did you even beat E.T. ?
3292152	3292753	No, I never did.
3292793	3293393	No one ever has.
3293413	3295655	In the existence of mankind.
3295695	3297497	There's a YouTube video of someone beating E.T.
3297857	3299558	YouTube videos can be fixed, sir.
3300459	3300839	Whatever.
3302240	3304282	Yes, when you beat E.T., the real E.T.
3304322	3306123	comes out, and it's actually a good game.
3306143	3306884	The real E.T.
3306924	3309126	comes out, shakes your hand, and goes to space.
3312068	3313929	No, I was going to say... I realize E.T.
3313949	3318413	is a notorious bomb, but that's because Atari produced more copies than there were a dying system.
3318693	3319614	It was awesome.
3319694	3320174	We have ghosts.
3342305	3349047	Oh my god, I seriously think we're about ready to have Armageddon live here in studio.
3349067	3350808	There's a storm going on outside.
3350948	3351668	Weemageddon!
3352128	3356370	That last burst of wind almost blew over the garage door.
3356410	3357450	That's going to be scary.
3357490	3358491	This is what we hear outside.
3359051	3362672	Whenever you get the little awning piece from the roof, it's like...
3363345	3366288	It'll be live on Justin TV, too, when we all get blown away.
3366308	3368890	I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
3368950	3370771	I'm controlling the apocalypse.
3372573	3373434	You're all fucked.
3375095	3376496	Can I read a Turok story?
3377237	3378378	Rob, do your story, please.
3378438	3380140	Alright, I'm going to read a Turok story.
3380380	3380660	E.T.
3380720	3382562	is officially banned on Orange Lounge Radio.
3382662	3383222	No way.
3383683	3384083	Vetoed.
3384483	3386205	I'll have to say a word that I just heard.
3386585	3387246	Weemageddon.
3387906	3388527	Weemageddon.
3389327	3390308	You should copyright the word.
3392311	3394415	Copyright, dude, Matt, you should copyright that.
3395116	3395917	It's my word.
3395977	3396839	I said Weemageddon.
3396859	3397800	Oh, they're right.
3397820	3399182	The Mats are fighting over Weemageddon.
3399483	3400384	Weemageddon out of here.
3402989	3404291	You can have Weemageddon.
3404311	3405393	Can we go back on the tape, please?
3405733	3406094	All right, no.
3406741	3408321	Look, moving on, Turok.
3408881	3409722	Turokageddon.
3410542	3415923	Turok, of course, was reinvented recently on the 360 and the PlayStation 3 and all that, and I don't know, I didn't play it.
3415943	3416403	Did you play it?
3416543	3418424	There's a franchise that needs to come back.
3418764	3419644	Oh, wait, no, it didn't.
3419804	3424325	Well, apparently some folks agree with you, because apparently Turok 2, rumor is, it's been canned.
3425725	3427085	Before it was even announced.
3427565	3430306	Apparently, this is because of some layoffs that just happened to Disney.
3430326	3431966	Again, this is all kind of rumored.
3432006	3434147	Nothing to do with the poor sales of the first game.
3435183	3441665	But they say maybe Turok 2 will return to development someday, but a bunch of the core people that were doing it are no longer there.
3441705	3442586	But here's the sad thing.
3442606	3448868	Apparently, Propaganda Games that was making this game were also the people that were supposed to be doing the Tron game for the new Tron title.
3449148	3450689	So they all might have been sacked.
3450829	3458632	They better find people to do the Tron game, or I will personally go there with steel-toed boots and kick every last one of them in the nuts.
3458972	3461153	Here, you want to make some money, I'll tell you how you do it.
3461213	3462373	It's very simple, okay?
3462673	3464374	You take the Left 4 Dead concept.
3465054	3468936	Jurassic Park, you're surviving dinosaur attacks, and that's it.
3469136	3469677	They did that, it sucked.
3471938	3473239	Actually, that would be pretty awesome.
3473259	3477041	They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game.
3477682	3481244	They did a first-person shooter Jurassic Park game, and it blew...
3482156	3482997	It was scary.
3483057	3484258	No, that was the one on Super Nintendo.
3484278	3485519	That scared the shit out of me.
3485539	3486139	That was crap.
3486219	3488601	It was the Sega CD one, but the arcade one blew too.
3489242	3491784	No, I'm talking Left 4 Dead Dinosaurs.
3492084	3493165	That would be cool.
3493785	3494926	I'm down for that.
3496847	3498369	This is the game that they need to make.
3499750	3503573	This is the game that they need to make using the Left 4 Dead engine.
3504193	3507956	They need to do Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness.
3509457	3510198	They did comics.
3510851	3512651	How about goats versus dogs?
3514532	3515792	How about I do my story?
3516032	3517652	Wait, how about I read a chat comment real quick?
3517672	3519413	Because there's actually some insightful stuff from chat.
3520593	3526574	TheRobD actually says something a little bit insightful, so I have to go to chat for insightful comments tonight because no one in the studio is saying anything.
3527014	3533736	TheRobD says, Is it funny, or it is funny that we take it for granted that a game will have a sequel, isn't it?
3534684	3535025	Transformers
3548241	3557087	Well, it's because I think if the first one makes any remote amount of money, because people aren't willing to do anything original because they want to stick to those franchises that they think are going to sell.
3557788	3563611	And, I mean, thank God we have the freaky guy bringing us Noby Noby Boy or else we'd have nothing original.
3563832	3565893	And yet they still won't bring us Guardian Legend 2.
3566694	3567174	I know!
3568014	3570416	I'm sorry, Noby Noby Boy isn't that original looking.
3570516	3571677	It looks just like Katamari.
3572725	3574665	Well, you know the video games industry is doomed.
3575065	3577886	Because they made another Turok after Turok Evolution.
3578366	3581807	And Turok Evolution, for anyone who played that game, was bad.
3582347	3583487	Really, really bad.
3583807	3584547	Not a good game.
3586388	3587848	Was it as bad as Superman 64?
3590529	3590949	Yeah.
3591329	3594589	And then they went and made Superman Returns, which was not very good either.
3594609	3596010	But that wasn't a sequel to Superman.
3596030	3597610	I mean, there's a difference between a sequel...
3598669	3599430	It was a reboot.
3599630	3602853	Yeah, that's kind of like what Turok, this last Turok was.
3603614	3607157	And actually, the last Turok reboot was Evolution, and it was horrible.
3607717	3611781	And Superman Returns, which was not a bad game if you only paid $10 for it.
3614439	3614740	60 bucks?
3614840	3615020	No.
3615040	3615520	10 bucks?
3615560	3615801	Yeah.
3616261	3621285	You know, you could be Superman and you could like blow cars around and tear up Metropolis and that'd actually hurt you.
3621465	3622746	Okay, here's a better example then.
3623187	3623927	Activision.
3623987	3632494	I did not play Superman 64 expecting Superman 2600 where you would fly and then be chased by the Kryptonite.
3632995	3634656	Superman for the 2600 was sweet.
3634696	3637539	Superman 64 managed to be worse than that.
3638419	3640181	Because the expectations were higher.
3641539	3644782	Because the 64 should have had a good game where you flew around and did interesting things.
3644822	3645382	Loki, go ahead.
3645402	3647864	We've got to keep the news moving because we're like an hour into the show.
3647924	3649005	I think it's my story.
3649145	3651267	Well, Hugh had a quick thought, and then we'll move on.
3651307	3662096	Yes, I was going to say Activision, you know, the purveyor of fine games, decided that, you know, Pimp My Ride the game was so awesome that they're going to put out Pimp My Ride Street Racing.
3663077	3664779	Yes, Pimp My Ride the game.
3665199	3666200	Awful, awful, awful.
3667213	3669335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3693715	3701000	Deadly Creatures on Wii, Eternal Sonata on PlayStation 3, Fear 2 Project Origin on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
3711787	3735944	King's Bounty, The Legend on PC, Last King of Africa on DS, Mushroom Men sounds hallucinogenic, that's for PC, Shellshock 2, Blood Trials on Trails, sorry, on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360, Star Ocean, The Second Evolution on PSP, and The House of the Dead Overkill on Wii, because you can't kill enough zombies.
3737668	3738008	All right.
3738208	3738649	Very cool.
3739549	3741731	In the U.S., there's actually quite a bit coming out as well.
3742291	3746474	Fear 2, Project Origin on both PS3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3747535	3751698	X-Blades coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
3752639	3754640	Deadly Creatures coming out on the Wii.
3755881	3756361	Let's see.
3758314	3761717	Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
3776349	3778311	We did it all at that last Genesis Collection.
3778351	3781593	It's like you play so many games and you unlock the arcade version of Altered Beast.
3782053	3784255	This Genesis Collection looks really awesome.
3784275	3788298	It's like 40 games, some really good stuff.
3789682	3790042	40 games for $30.
3790283	3799009	Well, and they're Genesis games, and the Genesis is the superior 16-bit system, so obviously you don't see a lot of Super Nintendo collections.
3799410	3804033	I have to say, I'm sometimes not a big fan of these remakes and stuff, but this looks pretty hot.
3804253	3806355	It's not really a remake, it's just a collection.
3806435	3807556	It's a repackaging.
3807736	3811339	Well, sure, but I mean, a remake is, you know, when they think of 3D or something.
3811499	3813200	LocoRoco 2 on PSP.
3814881	3820645	Then on the Wii and the Xbox 360, we have Onichanbara Bikini Zombie Slayers Yes!
3821485	3826669	And on Xbox 360, Onichanbara Bikini Samurai Squad Have you seen the cover art for that game?
3827409	3841478	This game is so epic that they made a movie for it in Japan A theatrical movie I'm going to be so broke this week I'll bring you some cover art, it's fantastic Let's see here
3842782	3846384	Jake Power Fireman, NASCAR Kart Racing, Retro Game Challenge, 8-Bit Games,
3868496	3869136	That's kind of neat.
3869476	3872397	House of the Dead Overkill, which will be truly epic.
3874058	3876739	Mass Effect is getting re-released as a two-disc edition.
3876759	3878860	They're going to have the download content in it as well.
3879580	3883742	And it's going to be $19.99, so that's pretty sweet.
3885703	3888163	And let's see here.
3889944	3891145	And that's actually it.
3891605	3894846	What's kind of interesting, though, is also this week... Isn't Street Fighter 4 this week?
3895754	3896495	No, that's next week.
3896535	3897135	Oh, damn it!
3897636	3898236	Ha ha!
3899277	3899657	Lame.
3900498	3910406	Anyways, also, actually, technically still this week, Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon, I believe, will be coming out next... 16th?
3910486	3914450	Actually, well, no, never mind, that's supposed to be Tuesday, so that's next week.
3914470	3915190	That game's going to be great.
3916251	3923918	And then, I think Lost and Damned is this week, or Lost and Damned for Grand Theft Auto 4, so that is what I'm really looking forward to.
3925026	3925506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3954906	3957908	PS3, Street Fighter 4, Skate 2, Mobile Suit Gundam, Gearan no Yabu, Axis no Kui 5, DS,
3979704	3981866	It doesn't look like there's actually a lot of stuff coming out.
3981906	3987933	There's a game called Hidamari Sketch, Doko Demo Sugoroku X365.
3988514	3989515	And I have no idea.
3989535	3991277	I'm trying to look at screen caps for this game.
3991317	3992158	Just saying it is fun.
3992498	3992819	Yeah, I know.
3992859	3993499	Just saying it is fun.
3993519	3999846	It looks like another minigame collection on the DS made up of little WarioWare-ish minigames is kind of what it looks like to me.
4000587	4000687	So...
4001528	4002309	I guess that could be cute.
4003330	4005391	But they're all cute little Japanese schoolgirls on there.
4005872	4011056	And on the Sony PSP this week, not a whole lot, but you do have Tenchu 4.
4011116	4015840	Looks to be a pretty big release coming out over there this week, as well as a port of the Gundam game that's on PS2 this week.
4016280	4017721	Otherwise, a pretty quiet week in Japan.
4018422	4020844	Probably because of Street Fighter 4 pretty much dominating.
4021885	4022345	So there you go.
4023966	4026088	There's your release dates for Japan.
4026228	4028150	So let's get back into some more gaming news.
4029438	4057283	Well, we have our Virtual Fighter Virtual Console UK news coming out actually should already be out as of Friday is Clayfighter which is on there for 800 Wii Points the equivalent of 6 pounds or 8 euros and another game that's on there is Sonic Chaos which was a Master System game and
4058403	4059864	is 500 Wii Points.
4061005	4063987	So it was actually the first Sonic game that had Tails playable.
4064627	4065007	There you go.
4066628	4068589	Is Clayfighter on the US Virtual Console?
4069690	4072852	If you can pull that down, that game is great.
4073112	4075113	I stopped following Virtual Console a while ago.
4076694	4077975	I don't know if we ever got Secret of Mana either.
4077995	4080517	Secret of Mana is supposed to be on the UK one, I thought.
4080917	4082758	Jeez, I don't think we got that here yet.
4083959	4086941	Seriously though, Clayfighter, you can be a Clay Elvis...
4088717	4101437	Fighting a clay like Norse Valkyrie chick Helga Fighting a blob Clay fighter Come on fight them if you dare Clay fighter, great
4104733	4111920	There was a viral video making its rounds this week that supposedly was a leaked Dead Rising 2 trailer.
4112881	4122371	And we know all about leaked trailers, that they sometimes tend to be not leaked by someone stealing it, but they're leaked on purpose.
4123392	4127396	This was shot off of a screen, apparently, off a TV.
4128277	4148408	and it showed what looks to be a teaser trailer basically looks like an overrun Las Vegas type area with casinos one scene they showed someone in a giant American Gladiators hamster ball thing rolling over zombies
4149705	4152567	So, to be honest, I think it's actually authentic.
4153007	4161895	And I think it is purposely released by Capcom because the audio in it, if you notice, is actually a direct feed from the trailer.
4161975	4165278	So, it's not just like shot off a TV audio.
4165652	4168353	Any idea if we're going to get some multiplayer co-op in this?
4168934	4170695	Because that's what Dead Rising needed.
4170735	4181300	It was a great game, but man, if it had like, sort of like Left 4 Dead, multiple players in the Dead Rising kind of gameplay against millions of zombies.
4181720	4182621	Oh, dude!
4182861	4193406	Yeah, no idea what it is exactly, but I know at the very end of the trailer it actually flashes the number two really quick, and there's also another scene that you see Frank West in the Mega Man outfit again.
4193726	4194507	I've been in a war.
4194887	4199051	Can I say, though, that Capcom has a really good pulse on where we want to kill zombies?
4199471	4203815	Because when I saw this trailer and saw that the next one is in Vegas or whatever, I was like, that's awesome.
4204456	4204836	No doubt.
4204916	4207238	Just like when I saw the first one, it was killing zombies in a mall.
4207298	4207939	That's awesome.
4207959	4211682	There's one company that knows killing zombies, that knows slaying the undead.
4211762	4212363	It's Capcom.
4212403	4213083	Let me put it this way.
4213143	4217287	If this is fake, it's an amazing fake.
4218688	4221771	Maybe Capcom should do this if this is a fake.
4223170	4226193	I will be willing to bet that you'll see this at E3.
4226954	4227214	Easy.
4228395	4229276	Start the buzz now.
4230177	4234701	What better way to get people talking about it than put out a trailer that's supposedly stolen.
4235001	4239885	Make a demo for E3 of E3 infested with zombies.
4240746	4242468	That actually would be pretty badass.
4242528	4244269	And you killing people are zombies.
4245350	4246051	Or maybe the reverse.
4246071	4247332	You're a zombie and you're killing people.
4248018	4250281	Well, the buzz is also starting on this game.
4250341	4251061	It's Saw.
4252963	4253444	The game.
4253844	4258810	You know, this is weird because I heard before that Saw was supposed to be coming out.
4258890	4259511	It was in development.
4259571	4260151	It got canceled.
4260171	4263315	Well, apparently now Konami has picked up the rights to do Saw.
4264115	4282009	I guess Brash Entertainment had started this game and stopped it Now Konami has actually picked up the rights since that other company closed down Variety was the one to actually report this The game is now going to be developed by Zombie Studios And it's supposed to come out right when the sixth Saw movie comes out this Halloween And I'm like, they really are on Saw VI?
4282069	4289154	It doesn't seem like something you can adapt into a game at all I mean, it just doesn't work for me I don't see how you're going to be able to do it
4289474	4290314	You know what?
4290774	4294636	To the dismay of fans of it in the room, I can foresee this.
4294816	4297397	If Konami makes Saw and it's a hit, it will kill Silent Hill.
4297817	4298297	Oh, I know.
4298557	4299958	That's the sad thing.
4300458	4302258	Because I'm thinking in my head, I'm like, well, okay.
4302639	4303099	But wait a minute.
4303119	4304379	Konami's done Silent Hill.
4304479	4306460	Granted, these are two completely different developers.
4306500	4308521	I've never really heard of this Zombie Studios before.
4308541	4309681	They haven't done anything to do with Silent Hill.
4310041	4311242	But I'm like, well, okay.
4311622	4313462	Silent Hill is actually a pretty rad game.
4313542	4315883	So if they made Saw, kind of like a game like that.
4315903	4317804	But I'm like, I just don't see Saw...
4318644	4319685	I don't think it's going to work.
4319705	4323828	I mean, it's just... Silent Hill's been on skids since 2 or 3, though.
4324349	4325109	And it's sad.
4325209	4327071	I don't think Homecoming did well.
4327751	4329573	They're doing everything they can to stem the tide.
4329593	4331174	They tried to action up Homecoming.
4331194	4331995	They tried to do the...
4332878	4337641	The remake, the Origins one, and, you know, that's all Konami needs.
4337681	4341263	If they come up with another horror franchise, they'll probably put Silent Hill out to pasture.
4341343	4346666	Yeah, I don't know how well Homecoming did, but I'm worried that there may not be a sixth one.
4347126	4351148	So, I hope you're wrong, but sadly, you might be right.
4351388	4353049	So, don't buy the Saw game.
4353589	4354110	Weemageddon.
4354970	4358492	But honestly, though, I mean, I don't see how they're going to be able to do it.
4358692	4359833	It's just, it's not...
4361050	4366212	It's Saw isn't a franchise that's really action-packed or anything, and I mean, it's... Hey, there's Silent Hill.
4366492	4378555	It's, it's, well, Silent Hill's easy... They'll just do the same thing, except for you'll be dodging, like, traps made by the Saw guy, and, you know, every once in a while you get yourself into some sort of weird ethical dilemma where you have to kill somebody.
4378595	4380776	I mean, actually, it sounds like they might be able to make a pretty cool game.
4382418	4383058	We'll buy it.
4383758	4384499	We'll see.
4384739	4385539	We'll check it out at E3.
4385559	4386620	Just to kill Silent Hill.
4386920	4390081	Jamie, you expressed a lot of displeasure at the news of a Saw game.
4390121	4391061	Are you excited about it?
4391481	4394842	I will stab you in the face if you buy the Saw game.
4394963	4395863	Saw in real life.
4396920	4401923	No, because first of all, the concept of Saw is, well, retarded.
4402583	4403003	Sorry!
4403804	4405084	And not very interesting.
4405225	4413769	And how can you... I guess, you know, if Nightmare on Elm Street did... You know, this is, I guess, our Nightmare on Elm Street for the modern age, except, you know, Freddy Krueger was funny.
4416906	4419729	And the fact that they're now rebooting Friday the 13th, right?
4419889	4420870	There's that new movie coming out.
4420890	4421791	But Jared Padalecki's in it.
4422131	4423132	And it does look cool.
4423192	4426695	The Nightmare on Elm Street, they're also doing without Robert Englund.
4427616	4428156	Which will not work.
4428176	4429778	You can't have him without Robert Englund.
4429818	4431199	He's not doing anything.
4431680	4432500	I mean, seriously.
4432520	4433681	He's slowly dying.
4433741	4435343	That's why they can't put him in it.
4435503	4436424	It doesn't matter.
4437285	4437885	He's old.
4438746	4439627	He's dying of old.
4441684	4447848	Anyway, my point is that Saw is a gimmick.
4448349	4463018	Silent Hill, basically, a lot of thought went into the psychology of the game and it created its own sort of mythology around what made that universe work.
4463078	4463619	You know what I mean?
4463939	4465480	Yeah, in other words, Pyramid Head is not a gimmick.
4465500	4466541	He's a fucking rock star.
4467561	4469743	They should stop putting him in every single game.
4470803	4478771	But my point is that, I mean, sure, if you want mindless bullshit in a game, get Saw.
4478831	4479371	Go for it.
4479752	4480853	Buy mindless bullshit.
4481313	4485117	If you want a game that's going to make you think a little bit and actually use your brain.
4485297	4486538	And possibly pee your pants.
4486658	4488400	And possibly pee your pants, yes.
4488880	4489721	Go for Silent Hill.
4489781	4491923	Besides that Silent Hill 2, Chainsaw.
4492324	4492764	Perfect.
4494866	4495807	Silent Hill is superior.
4497059	4498760	All right, let's move on with some other gaming news.
4498820	4501342	We're like an hour 15 into this show.
4501362	4502683	We're not even close to the end of it.
4502883	4507006	This is why Dan comes once every five years.
4507086	4509328	If you didn't want to hear from me, you wouldn't have invited me.
4509368	4510089	We like Dan.
4510129	4510689	We like Dan.
4510729	4511109	He's funny.
4512430	4516293	I invited my sweetie here and cuddled with him and said, come be on the show.
4516894	4518575	He goes, okay, and then lost his phone.
4520276	4525737	Anyway, so the... We gotta go to Jamie for our next story.
4525997	4526397	Oh, sorry.
4526557	4528598	I didn't realize she hadn't done the other story yet.
4531558	4532758	Anyway, anyway, anyway.
4534479	4539179	We were speaking earlier about series getting a reboot, so guess what's next in line?
4539800	4541020	Splatterhouse!
4541960	4547661	Which totally makes sense with Friday the 13th getting its reboot, because then you've got Dude in a Hockey Mask!
4549640	4551501	and freaking Splatterhouse is awesome.
4551521	4555024	I love the picture on the little article because I was the guy with the chainsaw hands.
4555604	4572476	Anyway, and as we all know, the game is actually out on virtual console right now, but they're talking later this year, Namco Bondi is planning quarter three for doing a new Splatterhouse game, and there actually is an official site up.
4574077	4584243	If you go to splatterhousegame.com, you can see some of the images from the game.
4585064	4590667	This is the first game that lets you use your own severed limbs as a weapon.
4591803	4601372	Yeah, your arms and stuff and your skin will get ripped off as you're playing the game or as you're getting damage done to you, and your limbs will grow back, and you can actually beat people with your limbs.
4601552	4603214	This won't be rated M or anything.
4603755	4612043	There's a lot of controversy about this, because apparently Namco just whacked the dev team for this game, which was a California-based developer, and...
4613556	4617940	I don't know if they handed it to another team or if the game's going to be put back or in limbo.
4618220	4620221	I heard the Afro Samurai people might be taking it.
4620241	4624925	Or the arm of the developer got cut off and given to the other team to use in developing the game.
4625425	4629889	This news, though, is coming right out of New York Comic Con, which was going on this weekend.
4630309	4630510	Right.
4630570	4638516	So it's interesting that we hear the dev team gets sacked, yet they're showing it at New York Comic Con going on this weekend, which is crazy.
4638716	4639677	So it's interesting.
4640347	4641567	Oh, that's the corporate world.
4642087	4642508	Mm-hmm.
4642768	4645408	Fast-paced, ever-changing world of video game development.
4645628	4646008	Exactly.
4646028	4648389	But that's okay, because in Splatterhouse, they'll grow the limbs back.
4649189	4649589	It's all right.
4650409	4653810	Anyhow, a couple more stories, then we'll get to the classic game of the week in a break.
4654370	4654710	All right.
4655391	4664113	Well, there is a brand-new update that they did to fix the HDMI audio issues that they were having with the HDMI audio cable for the 360.
4665796	4671140	However, as with most updates, it seems there are some problems.
4671540	4686650	And apparently a lot of people are reporting that after this update was downloaded to their Xbox 360 system, that they received the brand new present of an E74 error message, which is one of the one red light problem.
4687130	4692954	And it's funny because that also happens to be not covered by their warranty.
4693154	4693715	D'oh!
4696036	4697157	Sad Trombone.
4697577	4697858	Yes.
4698919	4701661	And so, yeah, a lot of people are pissed off at that.
4703662	4707706	You mean Microsoft developed a game console with a problem?
4708607	4709127	No.
4709487	4710408	No.
4712470	4714591	I've taken back six Xboxes in the last week.
4715852	4717214	Was it all because of this update?
4717394	4718715	No, those things just break.
4719916	4721137	They don't have to update them to break.
4721217	4722618	Microsoft, don't even worry about updating them.
4722638	4723399	They're just going to break.
4723419	4724900	You look at them funny and they'll break.
4726003	4728645	It's like the Xbox has feelings.
4729025	4730226	You looked at me funny.
4730246	4733768	You used me to do all your gaming and bought stuff for me.
4737410	4740691	I just want to cuddle.
4740792	4743773	I love when they ask you on the phone, was it plugged into a surge protector?
4743873	4746955	Oh yes, it was the surge protector's fault that my console broke.
4749356	4752038	I made the mistake of hooking it up to my TV.
4753257	4754938	That's why we have to give out a stupid award.
4770455	4774420	This week's Stupid Award goes to Daniel Alvarez.
4774580	4776263	He lives in Austin, Texas.
4776383	4777865	Why does he get the Stupid Award?
4778305	4781249	Because he got arrested on charges of assault.
4782050	4786796	Because what he did, he assaulted his girlfriend with a Wii controller.
4790630	4799241	Also, and possibly the even more hideous crime, as reported, he's also suspected of eating her cookies.
4800142	4804967	He seriously jumped up behind her with the nunchuck strap and like super spied her with it.
4805408	4805688	Yes.
4805848	4806850	Like it's like a rat line.
4808052	4808232	Really?
4808252	4808392	Really?
4827951	4842028	Christina Alvarado, who is the girlfriend what happened is that she actually told the police that she was attacked by her boyfriend and the thing was she was pissed off at him because he ate her Girl Scout cookies
4843504	4849067	And he was pissed off because he got woke up to get yelled at about the Girl Scout cookies.
4849428	4852189	So I guess to teach her a lesson, he choked her with a weed cork.
4852229	4853390	Don't you dare.
4854771	4854871	Ever.
4854891	4857352	Because I wake him up all the time for eating my stuff out of the fridge.
4857953	4861475	I was going to kill you.
4861735	4863076	It would not be with a weed cork.
4864448	4867269	Well, the unofficial city motto of Austin is keep Austin weird.
4867289	4868369	That's freaking weird right there.
4869130	4872131	So, I might go ahead and lean on that one to be true.
4872671	4874071	Yeah, that's wild.
4874231	4876472	And FYI, it does not appear to be made up.
4876652	4881314	They've linked to a source here that apparently says, yes, an Austin man has been
4881594	4889137	been accused of trying to choke his girlfriend with a cord of a Wii video game controller after she became angry that he had eaten all of her Girl Scout cookies.
4889177	4890998	You know what the gag is, though?
4891078	4896240	For the people who don't know about the way that the nunchuck works, is that all Wii controllers are cordless.
4901322	4904023	I bet that damage that any cords would not be covered under the warranty.
4904063	4905764	I wonder if that's what the defense attorney will try to say.
4905784	4908565	All you have to do is yank hard and unplug it.
4911701	4912301	Caramel sucks a lot.
4912321	4912842	I need to know one thing.
4912862	4912922	Yes.
4912942	4913943	Was he wearing the wrist strap?
4913963	4914743	No, no, even better.
4914783	4915164	Even better.
4915204	4915944	Did it have the condom on?
4940948	4942509	That's exactly... See, the match think alike here.
4942549	4944730	I was going to say the exact same thing before Loki took the mic away.
4944870	4949312	So... Yes, we need to know if it had the Wii condom on and the safety strap.
4949332	4959637	Because if it didn't have the safety strap on, Nintendo would have... They're not... It would have been even funnier if somehow during this whole struggle of him strangling her, that somehow the remote flew into the TV.
4962519	4964460	You guys are sick, sick people.
4965846	4967106	and it pains me to be associated.
4967126	4968987	They fought over fucking cookies.
4969327	4971087	Did you think that was serious?
4971147	4973287	At least there were no tacos thrown.
4974588	4977348	People have been trying to kill each other with game controllers for years.
4977768	4979008	I don't know if you know this.
4979108	4980509	It dates back to the 2600s.
4980669	4984629	Back when we had the NES Advantage, I could see someone getting killed with an NES Advantage.
4984649	4987910	He's got a scar on his back in the shape of a Clicca vision controller.
4989770	4992651	Then there was this one time that I woke up and Jamie was just...
4993704	4995745	stuff and a power pad down onto my face.
4996045	4997365	She's been trying to kill me with the game control.
4997405	4998085	Now she knows.
4998166	4998906	Use a Wii remote.
4999006	4999486	I'm dead.
5000606	5001747	You fuckers have killed me.
5001867	5003327	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.
5003447	5006408	SSJ100 Matt in our chat room has a great idea for a new video game.
5006448	5007869	Cookie Guy versus Taco Kid.
5010770	5011110	Alright.
5011390	5013450	Dark Knight asks, does Miyamoto have to choke a bitch?
5018068	5018708	Oh, boy.
5019289	5019589	So.
5019949	5024591	Yeah, we need to get to the classic game of the week and take a break and try to find our souls.
5025051	5032815	So every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura likes to dig through the archive of great gaming and find a video game she believes all of you should be playing.
5033195	5034536	It's our classic video game of the week.
5034576	5037317	DarkSakura, what should the kids be playing this week?
5037657	5038077	Gorf!
5039538	5039858	Bless you.
5040638	5041699	Well, I didn't throw up yet.
5044133	5044653	G.O.R.F.
5045434	5045814	G.O.R.F.
5045894	5049235	stands for Galactic Orbiting Robot Force.
5050055	5057797	And it's a very bizarre little game because it's like a version of three games in one.
5058898	5061779	Basically, your first level, you've got different missions.
5062419	5064980	So going through different missions will set up your rank.
5065840	5065960	And...
5068493	5068834	Anyway.
5069915	5071636	I guess what you're hearing is just a bunch of shooting.
5072077	5073338	It's basically Space Invaders.
5073418	5074640	The first stage of GORF is Space Invaders.
5074680	5079545	The first level is Space Invaders with a big circular shield that you kind of have to shoot through.
5081527	5082188	Yeah, the second...
5084679	5095470	The second level is, well, like my husband was saying behind the scenes, is like Galaga, where you have to shoot the little planes that shoot down.
5095530	5098353	It had the crappiest collision detection ever.
5098994	5100876	It wouldn't even shoot you and you'd explode.
5101616	5102197	Stupid game.
5104760	5106581	And then the last...
5108303	5123917	The last level was another... Well, at least in the arcade version you had the Galaxian-type level, and you had a Space Warp-type level after that, which was the Gyrus-like level, where it's...
5125298	5129861	Sort of weird perspective as if you're going into the war.
5129881	5132763	Kind of tempesty, as far as the perspective.
5134645	5140969	And then the last one is the flagship one, where actually you're going and shooting the alien ship, and it has a shield around it.
5141409	5143631	Like a semi-circular shield, so you have to shoot through it.
5144091	5149574	And the game was actually supposed to be a tie-in with Star Trek The Motion Picture, but it didn't fit in with the script, so they said, uh, no.
5149595	5154598	So, they put all these great 80s space games in a blender, and out comes gore.
5155739	5156239	Pretty much.
5157800	5166765	On top of that, it was actually saying here that it used the Votrax speech synthesis chip in the arcade version.
5167085	5168826	So it had the robot voice in it, too.
5168886	5169587	It was pretty cool.
5170487	5171968	I only played this in the arcade a couple times.
5172028	5177932	I had this on the ColecoVision, which to me is just the best version of GORF ever.
5178332	5179313	I love the little music it plays.
5179893	5193282	Um, but, um, the, uh, it's also saying that the, uh, the GORF, um, hardware actually, uh, was compatible and, uh, you can switch it out for other games like, uh, Wizard of War.
5194563	5195624	I'm gonna do something here with the music.
5195644	5201148	I'm gonna switch to the Commodore 64 version just because I love Commodore 64 and I see that there's one here on, uh, this.
5201168	5203589	But the GORF was out on, like, a million different systems, it seems.
5204590	5204790	Right?
5205611	5207112	Yeah, it was out on quite a few.
5213365	5214925	I think I played this on Commodore 64.
5214965	5215886	This looks familiar to me.
5215906	5218026	Like, I remember the circular shield and all that stuff.
5218326	5218726	Good times.
5219306	5233709	But, um... Basically, though, as you go through the levels and get to the end of it, and I've gotten to the end of it on the Clique of Vision, you get Space Cadet, Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and Space Avenger!
5237330	5241731	Um... There was a sequel planned, called MISBORF.
5243030	5243971	Yeah, I know.
5244131	5244791	Does Ms.
5244831	5245912	Gorf have a bow in her hair?
5245932	5247853	Is that what differentiates her from Gorf?
5248154	5248994	I don't know.
5252176	5255879	It was actually, I think it's cool, it was programmed in fourth language.
5258420	5260362	Is that like fourth meal at Taco Bell?
5260462	5269368	Well, the programmer of Gorf owns the source code, and it apparently only exists in a set of 8-inch floppy disks.
5271420	5281923	There were versions on the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Clicca Vision, the Atari 8-bit, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, VIC-20 in 1982.
5282784	5286245	The Galaxian mission was removed from all home ports.
5287985	5292987	It was given an Atari Jaguar port just by some guy.
5293687	5295128	You know, did it as a hobby.
5295709	5299831	And it was taken off of the market because he didn't go for any of the copyrights.
5300132	5301453	So, bastard.
5302213	5302794	I'm bored.
5302814	5304115	I think I want to remake GORF.
5304715	5305135	I know, right?
5306596	5311059	Also, the current world record for GORF, recognized by Twin Galaxies.
5316503	5317844	Hey, I watch King of Kong.
5317924	5318084	Hey.
5320040	5342070	I just realized a giant fart was enough to make the high scoreboard on GORF Here, let me make the scoreboard right now As Rob puts the microphone towards his crotch Anyway He also made the Guinness Book of World Records by a guy named Todd Rogers on November 24th, 1982 at Haunted Trails in Burbank, Illinois He is?
5343091	5347693	Oh, apparently he's in the King of Kong And my husband says he looks like Ron Jeremy
5349163	5351565	The Rob D's in chat going, I hate Todd Rogers.
5351865	5352786	I know it's Todd Rogers.
5353086	5353426	I hate him.
5354627	5358149	I'm paraphrasing.
5358189	5358149	653,990.
5358349	5360170	I want someone to break it.
5362672	5363973	That would involve playing GORF.
5364553	5365394	GORF is fun.
5366954	5372978	I am putting out a personal challenge to someone to break Todd Rogers' score on GORF. 653,990.
5380007	5405634	it would actually be pretty awesome if you could break it with a score of 666,000 if someone whoever manages to break that will get a no prize from me will be interviewed on Orange Downs Radio and will win a shiny penny you also get in the Guinness Book of World Records though
5406209	5406569	It might.
5406929	5407490	Alright, look.
5407930	5408511	Enough GORF.
5408671	5410012	Wrong.
5410072	5410852	No, good choice.
5410932	5415955	It's definitely a game I think a lot of people have not heard of or forgot about, so bringing GORF back to the spotlight.
5416416	5418497	And hopefully that old record can be shattered.
5418517	5421059	How about a little anecdote regarding me picking that game?
5421199	5421419	Sure.
5421599	5424921	I was actually trying to think of a good epic RPG, and I was like, I'll fuck it, GORF.
5426402	5427143	Whatever works for you.
5429204	5430425	It just stuck in my head.
5431567	5434770	Alright, anyhow, we're going to take a break while Dan and Jamie get into an argument.
5435051	5435932	We're going to take a break.
5436652	5439235	Everything she knows about classic video games she stole from me.
5439255	5440957	And then she flipped me off.
5441912	5442793	Right on the air.
5442873	5443893	We're going to take a break, you guys.
5443913	5445814	We'll be back with plenty more Orange Launch Radio.
5445834	5447215	We have more to come in Part B tonight.
5447695	5451677	We're going to talk about Indiana Jones and a great Indiana Jones game that might be making a comeback.
5451697	5458320	We're going to finally talk about iPhone gaming, which I promised Dan we could do earlier, and a new project from Rockstar Games, which I'm sure has Loki pretty excited.
5458340	5461782	We'll be talking about all of that in Part B right after this.
5461862	5464063	Stay tuned, guys, with more of Orange Launch Radio.
5470506	5499907	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 8th of 2009 Where we are doing the 312th episode of our show, Orange Lounge Radio We always tape live Sunday nights at allgames.com Of course, if you were listening live tonight, there was a little bit of mad stuff going on during the break We've kind of been joking throughout the evening, there's a lot of wind and rain type stuff going on outside It seemed to have knocked our network out for a little bit, because we dropped during the break Our podcast listeners won't notice a thing, because they just get that little break in between there So, um...
5500447	5500707	DarkSakura.com
5525183	5535005	and I know not everyone has different things so I'll pick different consoles and arcade or whatnot but I will be putting something up very soon for a high score classic game contest
5535421	5545043	And talk to our web guy about that because with the new website and everything, there's now a thing where you can upload pictures directly to our website by sending this particular email address so people can send their scores.
5545423	5547784	Maybe we can do a little widget or something with the scores.
5547884	5548984	We could probably put something together pretty easy.
5549004	5549424	It would be fun.
5550024	5550765	I'm still working on it.
5552285	5558426	But, you know, I used to do the game knowledge quiz back when I had Pump Up the Volume.
5558967	5560387	And I'd kind of like to do something like that again.
5560407	5560887	That would be fun.
5561167	5562648	Indiana Jones, Staff of Kings
5591568	5594972	Adventure Game, Indiana Jones, and the Fate of Atlantis.
5595453	5597596	Sorry, you didn't hear that music on the feed.
5598477	5598837	My bad.
5599538	5603043	So yeah, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis on the Wii version.
5603804	5608310	Pretty good if you don't have, you know, a Scum emulator on there.
5609625	5610225	or ScumVM.
5610446	5616989	And this is like one of the all-time classic, you know, click-and-point games, so it's pretty awesome.
5617309	5622092	Are they not doing that 360 and PS3 one that they announced?
5622152	5622953	Maybe not right now.
5623093	5623853	It might be later on.
5624453	5624774	Weak.
5626995	5629776	Well, this is also on the Wii, so maybe just, you know, multi-platform.
5629817	5638081	Well, it's on the Wii and everything, but yeah, Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP because, you know, they can port that crap easy, so...
5640805	5645578	I don't know, there may be another one coming out for the PS3 and 360 they're still working on
5647148	5658955	Well, I don't know if you would file this under WeMageddon or what you'd do, but apparently EA, they made a lot of announcements this week because they had a financial call going on this week, and apparently they are going to be porting Dead Space to the Wii.
5659056	5665139	Says a quote from the call, the CEO, John Riccatello, says, Unfortunately, what you don't know is that it's going to be Dead Space Party.
5675826	5682969	and it's actually going to be a party spinoff because they couldn't really do an actual legit hardcore game for the Wii.
5683549	5689011	Well, I don't know, but the interesting thing about this is that they actually say also this from a magazine interview.
5689111	5692592	Quote, go look at Dead Space and imagine playing that game with a wand and nunchuck.
5692612	5695613	If they improve the precision, then you could have a good experience.
5695773	5699134	Hmm, is it a hint that Motion Plus could be supported by this?
5699274	5701755	And imagine that the graphics look slightly worse.
5703036	5703816	Slightly worse.
5705173	5705734	It's like this.
5706575	5710217	If EA pulls this off, and they're a company on the upswing.
5710237	5714421	I mean, I know that profits are down and they're laying people off.
5714441	5718984	But creatively, while that's a great word, you've got to give EA credit.
5719345	5722067	They're head and shoulders above where they were last year this time.
5722807	5724949	They're coming off of Dead Space, which was amazing.
5725229	5726990	Mirror's Edge, which was a heck of a game.
5727331	5729452	Just a bunch of great titles coming out of EA.
5729753	5732875	If they pull this off, props.
5732935	5733576	I mean, because...
5734930	5740455	We need super cool games, but man, I don't know how you're going to do it without the graphic power.
5741136	5744679	Because Dead Space is a game where the visuals are just so important.
5745400	5748683	Well, granted, if Dead Space really is about the graphics, then whatever.
5748743	5750685	But should games really be about the graphics?
5750745	5751686	Not necessarily, right?
5751846	5752707	Well, maybe, maybe not.
5752727	5754288	But I mean, play Dead Space.
5755670	5756370	Have you played Dead Space?
5756491	5758312	No, because it's first person.
5758332	5759894	That game will fuck you up for life.
5761629	5763070	I'll check it out, but I just know not yet.
5763270	5764230	It's atrocious.
5764730	5770552	And I think so much of the atmosphere in that game is it's just super, super good visuals.
5770592	5775734	But I will say, one of the other games you mentioned, I'm not usually much of a first-person gamer, but Mirror's Edge is pretty hot.
5775974	5776934	I think that game's pretty hot.
5776954	5779135	It's one of those things where it's like, if they tried to do that on Wii...
5779875	5808685	and they could do it right and have motion controls and stuff hey you know great more power to you the Wii needs these games you know even even if it's not about graphics which it's not about graphics if they can bring uh this game in a meaningful way to the other system uh to the Wii it would it would validate the Wii's existence because there are too many mini game collections and don't get me wrong I know for the Wii's uh mainstream target audience that's I guess what sells but uh
5811212	5827021	Again, if you're just joining us live tonight here on All Games Radio, Orange Lounge Radio, live on All Games, I just want to point out, that's Dan, Jamie's husband, often talked about on the show, but rarely heard from, but he's here tonight and telling it like it is from his experience working in game stores for many years.
5830077	5843506	In other gaming news, especially in iPhone gaming news, which, you know, as a person who has an iPhone and actually plays the games on it, I still don't know what I think about having this one on there because it just seems like it would be cheaply easy.
5844347	5854654	But Time Crisis is supposed to be coming on to the Apple App Store, actually already on there, where you can play with the finger of death.
5855694	5856675	Thank you for watching!
5873905	5880909	Very interesting, though, at this rise of console gaming franchise classics coming on the iPhone.
5880929	5895256	And I don't know if it's just because it's kind of like all Namco and Konami, but just within 2009, we've had news of Katamari, Time Crisis, Silent Hill, Metal Gear, DDR.
5895276	5896757	Yeah, there's a Silent Hill iPhone game now.
5896817	5897957	Oh, you weren't here last week.
5898237	5901139	I have it if you want to check it out before you buy it and spend $7 on it.
5901499	5903180	But there's a Silent Hill iPhone game now.
5903200	5903660	Don't do it.
5904241	5908164	It's not Fog Adventure Silent Hill.
5908204	5909745	It's like a Dungeon Explorer type thing.
5909785	5911547	So just try before you buy.
5911567	5912247	That's all I'm saying.
5912508	5913929	But yeah, there's a Silent Hill game on iPhone now.
5914229	5914629	It's crazy.
5917172	5920535	It's just interesting, this whole barrage of stuff we're getting.
5921539	5923760	I don't think the Metal Gear Solid game is out yet, but we know it's coming.
5924421	5926402	It is in the works at least.
5926502	5927142	Metal Gear.
5928603	5930524	It's just interesting, I suppose.
5930904	5937068	Well, you know, I was going to say another game we didn't talk about because it wasn't our show role, but Rolando.
5937688	5938949	I don't know if you remember that game.
5939389	5940470	Who made Rolando?
5966004	5966705	That I don't know.
5967005	5967465	No idea.
5967585	5972490	I just know Aurora Faint is a hell of a puzzle game that I'm enjoying on iPhone.
5972590	5973050	It's great.
5973290	5974131	It is LocoRoco.
5974431	5975052	That's crazy.
5976433	5984320	But one thing that you won't find anymore on the iPhone App Store is the iPhone Duck Hunt game.
5984720	5991426	Yes, the Nintendo lawyers have finally swooped in like a duck and plucked the game off the...
5992529	5993710	Anything about the Game & Watch?
5993910	5996091	And then the dog rose out of the bushes and laughed at him.
5996232	6004757	You know the Nintendo lawyer, after he laid the smackdown on that stupid little company, did the Nintendo dog laugh.
6004797	6006638	What about the Game & Watch games that were on there?
6006678	6008299	I don't know, those may still be on there.
6008540	6009800	I downloaded a couple of them.
6010841	6013483	I downloaded the one that was free, but I didn't download any of the others.
6013583	6017025	Reggie's going to show up at your house and personally delete them off your iPhone.
6017526	6019327	He's going to Falcon Punch us with his cock.
6021196	6048142	I did want to give a quick shout out real quickly because we were talking about iPhone games and Namco and all their franchises not on the iPhone but on the Playstation 3 I believe a Namco collection is being released or has just recently been released and I hear it's pretty cool and you want to check it out, the Namco Museum on PS3 I think that's only in the Japanese store remember because they were tying those in also where you can get like t-shirts and shit for home I think it's going to be on it's way here pretty soon and I hear you want to check it out
6049218	6051207	I didn't come out for the 360 like last Christmas.
6051550	6056632	Well, they had the Namco, it was a Namco arcade something for the 360.
6056692	6064916	They had like a bunch of the Xbox Live Arcade games and then they had some other classic games and remade stuff.
6064936	6067638	And that was supposed to be pretty good and I think it's probably pretty cheap now.
6067718	6070919	Yeah, it had some live, it was like 30 bucks and it had like 30 games or so.
6070939	6079703	And I mean, it had, it was this really weird thing because it had games you could play off the disc, then it had games you had to import on your hard drive and play as like live arcade games.
6080404	6080464	Um...
6081144	6081925	Pac-Man Championship Edition
6099525	6102388	All right, well, we're going to get to the mailbag in just a minute.
6102648	6104931	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com with your emails.
6105031	6109596	But I have one more story about iPhone gaming, and this ties in kind of exactly what you were saying a little bit ago.
6109736	6114341	And this is iPhone is growing and growing and starting to become mobile gaming.
6114381	6115062	In fact, right now,
6115682	6122267	They are saying that iPhones are accounting for 14% of mobile game downloaders, and that was in the month of November.
6122287	6128812	32.4%, that's like a third of all iPhone users, say that they have downloaded a game.
6128992	6130893	In the month of November, they downloaded some type of game.
6131814	6135957	Just to put that in perspective, across most mobile phone companies, you're looking at 3.8%.
6138422	6143568	So you're talking like 10 times as many people on the iPhone check out games.
6143969	6152179	I don't know, is that because the iPhone games... Go back a year on this show, just go back one year on this show before iPhone apps started coming out.
6152279	6155683	Mobile phone gaming was kind of the butt of many jokes on this show.
6156904	6160265	In other countries, mobile gaming has been just fantastic.
6160785	6171848	But we haven't had a phone until the iPhone or the Trio or the ones like that came out that was capable of handling an actual game with solid gameplay.
6172569	6173309	And let me say this too.
6173329	6177450	The chatters, chat.orangelawnradio.com, we always look at that here on Sunday nights.
6177750	6180231	Catacos in chat room says, well, let's get serious.
6180271	6182371	What other phone can play games on them that are that good?
6182632	6184132	Might I mention the N-Gage?
6185799	6187202	No, seriously, the iPhone.
6187323	6191473	The iPhone, you know, it amounts to what, like 3%, 30%, whatever, of games downloaded.
6191493	6195102	But it amounts to 100% of the decent phone games to download.
6196252	6199714	I will say this, that I did have a couple of cool games on my old phone.
6200995	6203917	It was intensely hard to play, but I did have Super Pac-Man.
6204297	6213343	Once in a while, even as hard of a time as we gave them in the past, the Luminous one that they had on phones was pretty freaking good for a phone game.
6213824	6219207	And the Doom RPG and stuff, they had some pretty intricate stuff even on the old-ass phones.
6219267	6220788	I did play Bejeweled on my old phone.
6221409	6221529	So...
6222729	6227234	But most of it was a joke because it was cashing in on the Spongebob and all that crap.
6227274	6228656	They were just crappy little games.
6228996	6234763	Speakeru says, I have an N-Gage and does NES and Mega Drive emulation pretty well.
6235463	6236585	That's the only thing it's good for.
6236805	6238146	I guess that would be a reason to have it.
6238527	6240329	Tony Hawk on N-Gage was not that bad.
6240836	6243781	Alright, let's get to the mailbag here, guys.
6243841	6246946	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have questions for us.
6247127	6250352	Every week you guys send in your emails and we like to open up the mailbag and read through them.
6250933	6252455	And DarkSakura's going to do it right now.
6257659	6258859	Do we actually get some emails this week?
6258899	6259460	Yes, we did.
6259700	6260100	All right.
6260920	6263621	We had a poor showing last week, so I'm glad people listened.
6263921	6269423	Rob with two Bs says there's new box art on NeoGAF.
6269463	6270403	What's NeoGAF?
6270543	6271044	G-A-F?
6271444	6272644	Neo games are fun.
6272704	6276525	Yeah, these huge forums that tons and tons of people look at.
6276545	6277966	Okay, I just haven't been there before.
6278406	6280527	Probably because there's like a million different gaming forums on the internet.
6280547	6281407	I don't know.
6281827	6286029	Supposedly, he says, supposedly the Williams Pinball Hall of Fame is being ported to PS3, Xbox 360.
6287509	6287929	Yes it is.
6288770	6291611	He says, I actually bought this for PSP Wii and PS2.
6292151	6293412	I'm curious to see the graphics.
6294773	6296533	I'm curious to see if they add some more tables.
6297054	6298034	The Wii, you know what?
6298134	6300375	Oh god, Funhaus is on the freaking cover.
6300415	6301116	I hate that game.
6302016	6305358	Call Wii Mageddon as much as you want, but that Wii game was pretty awesome.
6305418	6306018	The pinballs.
6306038	6307579	Dan's giving his thumbs up approval.
6307739	6309720	Yeah, that was a pretty awesome collection of games, I gotta say.
6310694	6313795	You like pinball, you have a 360, download Pinball FX.
6314155	6314695	It's awesome.
6315055	6317175	But Pinball Hall of Fame is great.
6317516	6320716	If they go crazy, add some new tables with the 360 PS3 versions.
6320876	6322637	That'll be awesome.
6322697	6325977	It's actually a really good pinball collection, really good physics.
6326377	6330278	And honestly enough, my vote's for the Wii version because of the non-checked remote controls.
6333820	6337229	Our next one comes from Geekboy2424.
6337790	6340016	Hi guys, I have come to a conclusion.
6340156	6340637	I have ADHD.
6342916	6362545	along with a little bit of OCD my question for the week is how do you guys stop yourselves because the only thing that works for me is playing games when is okay I guess when I sit at my desk I can't concentrate because I can't sit freaking still help Dr. Orange Lounge sincerely Geekboy2424
6363786	6364306	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6389406	6417001	but if like you're for real real like you have to play video games to get around your ADD that you think you have you might want to see a doctor I'm just saying we can't diagnose that and that's a huge liability if we even tried to now that Rob has said something responsible I say self-medicate play games all the time just it's not going to kill you or anything just just play them when you're at your desk whoop out your game boy um you know if it calms you down and it makes you feel good it's not like you're doing drugs or something hook it up man
6417659	6419380	Just remember to go to the bathroom once in a while.
6420661	6425384	When I was a young hyperactive child, they used to make me drink coffee to calm down.
6425784	6432689	Because caffeine, when you're already wired up and hyper, actually can be a sedative.
6435231	6435451	What?
6437492	6438573	I'm not giving medical advice.
6438593	6439573	I'm just saying what I used to do.
6440114	6441355	I'm just saying coffee's delicious.
6441395	6443216	That's not medical advice, by the way.
6443276	6444637	That's just what I used to do.
6445666	6447027	Liability, liability, liability.
6448248	6450270	No, I understand.
6450951	6454034	Anyway, um... But you know what?
6454534	6455395	ADD is in your head.
6457757	6458898	I'm kidding.
6459779	6460320	Next email.
6462502	6462582	Um...
6464116	6472444	Hi OLR, I'm sending this message from my iPod Touch with a cracked screen because my smart self dropped it on the ground while going from a friend's house to mine.
6473305	6479291	Anyway, I came to say hi because I've been listening to the podcast lately and laughed about the kid that threw a taco at his mom.
6481845	6483448	By P.S.
6483668	6487233	He didn't put any spaces or anything.
6487674	6491380	This message came from your friendly neighborhood MySpace friend, Aroka7.
6492041	6493022	Sent from my iPod.
6494406	6494726	The end.
6520060	6528965	the team at Konami of Hawaii and he was the audio director of the Xbox series and part of the reason why I'm stopping the whole show to mention this and
6530782	6540285	Just kind of take a minute to kind of soak this all in is that I don't know if you guys remember back when we would do the podcast and the show itself, the radio show itself as separate shows.
6540785	6546567	But one year we had a big, big score that we had the Universe soundtrack.
6546607	6552409	We premiered those songs here on Orange Lounge Radio and I think it was like Ultramix 4 at the time before anybody else got to hear them.
6553249	6559171	That was Stillwind who coordinated all that with us here over email and was a big part, I know, of the fan community as well.
6560831	6589058	so I'm just kind of it does not I'm just kind of shocked and saddened to hear it and I'm sorry to depress everybody with this news but I'm just finding it out myself and this is sometimes the problems that you have when you do a live radio show is that you get live news I don't know, you know, Babani Style is a pretty respectable site, I don't see why they would lie about something like this and just, no, that would be in very poor taste, so I'm pretty sure this is legit and very sad and
6591790	6594115	I don't know what else to say.
6594135	6600028	I'm very sorry to hear this for his family and everybody and for the community that have really lost something with this.
6600710	6601552	That's really sad news.
6602292	6604234	I'm very sorry to derail the mailbag with that sad news.
6604254	6605555	He died from a ruptured aorta.
6606355	6607416	Oh, that is very sad.
6609818	6619425	Okay, but he did a lot for the show a couple years ago and did keep in touch a little while here and there, so I just wanted to pass that news along.
6621366	6621586	Sorry.
6622227	6628051	Please tell me the next email has a dick and fart joke or something to bring the humor back to the show because I really just killed it right there.
6628091	6628892	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
6629648	6631588	Okay, well, hi folks.
6632029	6639010	I just thought I'd throw in my proverbial two cents regarding the subject of rampant fanboyism that is often seen quite a lot on the net.
6639530	6654314	Personally, I think that no matter what systems one promotes or trashes, fanboyism in any form just makes us gamers look like the mouth-breathing cheetos dust encrusted in bread Neanderthals that non-gamers perceive us, and quite frankly, this kind of thing really needs to stop.
6654454	6655694	Big, long sentence, wow.
6657401	6666383	Speaking as someone who has both the 360 and PS3, and a whole shit ton of other systems from previous generations, I can honestly say the following.
6666423	6668163	There's no such thing as a perfect system.
6668783	6674605	Either there's a flaw in the hardware itself, or there's a feature service or some other aspect that another system does better.
6675245	6681026	Additionally, just because a given game isn't on one system of choice, that doesn't mean it's a crap game.
6681966	6692369	Conversely, just because a game is exclusive to one's favorite system, that doesn't make the game the greatest thing since the invention of breast implants.
6693449	6698711	Simply put, each system has strengths as well as weaknesses, good games as well as total turds.
6699311	6702872	It helps to have multiple consoles so one has that much more options for gaming.
6703052	6703712	Amen to that!
6703953	6708154	Because you know what we always said on this show, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
6710773	6711874	That sums it up right there.
6712554	6713434	And that's from Spazinator.
6714475	6715355	Dreamcast, yo.
6717716	6719336	Dude, Dreamcast is turning 10 this year.
6719376	6719896	Can you believe it?
6720097	6720897	I was just thinking about that.
6721277	6721897	That's crazy.
6722077	6724398	I remember standing in line on September 9th, 99.
6725698	6729600	It's interesting, though, that we do have three very distinct consoles that are out there right now.
6729640	6731581	And all of them have decent games on them.
6731861	6733941	And all of them have some pretty crap games on them.
6734081	6735702	You have two consoles and you have the Wii.
6737352	6742594	But even the Wii, you know, the Wii's got, for a particular audience, it has games people want.
6743974	6746715	Soccer moms and families, it's got a ton of stuff that people want.
6746755	6758879	But the console war right now, and while it's not a war for first place because Nintendo's got that, the console war, the culture clash in gamers right now is PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360.
6759179	6765642	Just like last generation, GameCube was there, but it was really Xbox versus PS2.
6765662	6765802	Yeah.
6768478	6772599	I mean, I've been hitting the gaming forums for a long time.
6772639	6775960	I don't just work in a game store, but I work in a game store because I'm a gamer.
6776641	6781262	And, you know, the fanboyism is always going to be there.
6781782	6782722	I own every system.
6782942	6784423	And I mean every system.
6784803	6785523	They really do.
6788084	6789624	In our defense, we do not own a Jaguar.
6791525	6792565	I would if I found one.
6793925	6805272	But, hey dude, Tempest 2000 is sweet, and Aliens vs. Predator is good, Cybermorph is not too bad, but back on the subject of fanboyism, I always have my favorites.
6805292	6811936	You know, when it came down to Genesis vs. Super Nintendo, I would argue Genesis for hours.
6812036	6815779	And my wife says Super Nintendo, they're both great, don't get me wrong, Genesis.
6817780	6818000	But,
6819935	6820515	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6842003	6846384	They win because we refuse to acknowledge our competition, therefore we are the victors.
6846404	6848345	We win because our system is made by Sony.
6848425	6849545	He's also not making that up.
6849565	6851026	They're also eating too much periwinkle.
6852486	6855287	He's paraphrasing, but he's not making that up, what he's saying.
6855567	6857407	And they're also eating too much burnt sienna.
6857587	6860008	We are the number one Sony system on the planet.
6860308	6861068	And that's fine.
6861949	6863669	The company is going to try to brainwash you.
6863689	6864449	Sadly, no.
6864489	6865830	The PlayStation 2 is.
6867250	6867710	That's true.
6868050	6868711	And the PSP.
6868931	6869431	But pick
6870151	6872314	Pick the system that you like and fight for it.
6872595	6876981	Get on the forums and tell everyone who likes the other system that they are ass close.
6877041	6877601	That's right.
6878022	6879704	I want to see more rap and fanboyism.
6879925	6881166	Be into what you're doing.
6881727	6883510	Jamie's dying to read the last email, Jamie.
6883630	6884391	Dear lord.
6885996	6886657	Last email.
6887117	6887697	You brought him.
6887937	6888518	You brought him.
6888838	6889198	I know.
6889318	6890219	I'm loving it, though.
6891019	6892480	Dan, I love Dan.
6892540	6898304	I'll tell you one thing that Sony does win in, and this is absolutely, you can't really, I think, argue this.
6899165	6906530	If the systems were used for blunt force trauma, they definitely would win because that system is heavy and quite solid.
6906970	6910172	360, it is pretty heavy, not quite as solid in the Wii.
6910232	6912934	Well, that's not very bad or not very good.
6913334	6914795	You come after me with a PS3.
6914915	6916976	I'll come after you with a 360 power supply.
6917376	6918556	And we'll see who gets who.
6922058	6922278	What?
6922558	6923038	Fanboyism.
6924939	6927140	Okay, last email.
6927320	6932383	At least Dan's rambling has mean I've gotten to eat more bread and get more crumbs in my cleavage.
6933443	6933843	Excuse me.
6936024	6936244	No?
6937205	6937525	Are you done?
6940623	6942384	Okay, last email.
6942444	6943804	Hey, OLR, love the show.
6944244	6946345	I never miss an episode on the podcast feed.
6947085	6951767	It's tough for me to catch the live show because I live on the East Coast and have young twins.
6951787	6954247	I'm early to work on Monday morning, blah, blah, blah.
6954848	6958869	Basically, what I'm saying is that I have a tough time staying up as late as the show runs.
6963608	6970895	Also, I love the fact that you guys, in podcast form, help me through the monotonous parts of my office job.
6971796	6972276	Amen.
6973197	6975979	Lately, I've been sad that the feed has been so far behind.
6976420	6978642	Is there any way that you could update the feed more regularly?
6978982	6980704	I've been missing my OLR fix every week.
6981121	6984384	Yes, it got updated twice last week and will be updated twice this week and will be caught up.
6984945	6995294	So we're slowly catching up and, you know, again, it's kind of just the side thing of having two computers running this thing off of and I just get far behind and I'm only one person.
6996115	6997136	But we're almost there.
6997976	7003782	Regardless, I appreciate your efforts as an independent podcast and wish you many more great episodes, Boston OLR fan.
7004386	7006607	And I hear that a lot, that we help people through the work week.
7006627	7010009	So I know it's kind of depressing when your three-hour show you relied on isn't there.
7010109	7011070	So I'm trying, guys.
7011570	7012591	We'll get caught up.
7012771	7013311	We're almost there.
7014592	7015813	So, great.
7015833	7016814	Thanks for the emails, guys.
7016854	7017354	Send us more.
7017454	7021416	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I'm hijacking this, mother.
7021817	7022737	Next week's mailbag.
7022797	7023498	Did you love Dan?
7023678	7025299	Did you hate Dan?
7025339	7025719	There you go.
7027791	7028873	Red Dead Redemption Red Dead Revolver
7046295	7052298	It's actually going to be using the Rage engine again, so very similar to what they did with Grand Theft Auto 4.
7053879	7061944	And of course, they say that there's going to be the complete open world with strong plot lines in a massive, vibrant, rural environment.
7063145	7066907	And it's supposed to be coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360, no sort of time frame though.
7067827	7069368	Is that one out of left field or what?
7070268	7070989	A little bit, yeah.
7072210	7072650	Red Dead Revolver
7096332	7096932	Yeah, that's true.
7096972	7098173	That was like four years ago.
7098233	7098613	That's true.
7098633	7102475	So, I mean, you know, Bully's still got two, three more years before we need a sequel for it.
7103936	7105837	But then remember when we got Excite Truck?
7106557	7107838	Excite Truck was like great.
7108018	7112160	Dude, I know Excite Truck was awesome, but I'm just saying like, dude, how many years ago was Excite Bike?
7112380	7115782	I don't even see Excite Truck and Excite Bike as even remotely similar games.
7116362	7116643	They're not.
7116663	7119704	The games play completely different, but they are kind of like, you know, they do.
7120164	7123186	It makes me happy that Nintendo used the prefix Excite again.
7123226	7124226	Because it did excite me.
7124266	7125187	For the third time.
7125687	7128908	You got Excitebike, Excitebike64, which is sweet.
7128948	7130749	And if that's on a virtual console, it should be.
7131309	7134330	And Excite Truck, which is actually the best driving game on the Wii.
7135310	7136110	Right there with Mario.
7136190	7137470	Now they need Excite Tank.
7137650	7139251	Oh, dude, sweet.
7139291	7141812	Because nothing excites me more than the thought of driving a tank.
7142452	7145653	Or actually Excite Truck with like a battle mode would be pretty awesome.
7145673	7146273	Excite Humvee.
7148186	7149826	or, hey, let's take it even better.
7150367	7158569	Instead of an Excite Bike or Excite Truck sequel, just do another Excite Truck game, but like with Mario stuff, like making it like a Mario Kart off-road racing game.
7158589	7159829	No, shut up.
7160649	7163150	It doesn't need, we don't need, Mario's everywhere already.
7163530	7164090	Excite Truck 2.
7165770	7166450	It'll be very simple.
7166510	7168431	Or just a new F-Zero, for God's sake.
7168711	7169071	You know what?
7170952	7171892	I'm sorry, yes, DarkSakura?
7171952	7172632	Excite Jet Ski.
7174342	7176723	Isn't that in Wii Sports?
7176823	7180104	Isn't the new Wii Sports, what do they call it, Wii Sport Resort or whatever it's called?
7180185	7180365	Yeah.
7180385	7181445	Doesn't that have a jet ski thing in it?
7181465	7181785	Yes, it does.
7182045	7182405	I think it does.
7182425	7183906	Wave Race 65.
7187507	7190749	SSJ100 Matt is flash forwarding to E3 this year.
7191289	7196291	Nelly, that's Matt's wife, Nelly interviewing Reggie, why the fuck aren't you making Excite Truck 2?
7199918	7207251	I would totally... Sad thing is, Nelly will have no idea who the hell Reggie is, so if that were to actually happen, it could.
7207512	7210397	GS68 suggested excite butt.
7211438	7212540	No, you can't drive a butt.
7212841	7213262	Alright, look.
7214739	7216699	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7244324	7245665	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7274561	7275002	I'll show you.
7275363	7276887	He has some serious buck teeth.
7277148	7278652	Dark skin, short hair.
7278893	7281099	It's just the whole, you know, like, but it's just...
7282500	7282780	I don't know.
7308359	7310861	So this is like a Capcom thing.
7310901	7312402	This is like an official product.
7312522	7314483	Sort of, but in another country.
7314643	7325591	Like, you know in Japan, in Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter on the Saturn, there was a character that they couldn't have anywhere else in the world because he was copyrighted, I guess.
7326611	7327532	Norimaro, right?
7328072	7328813	He was like a comedian.
7329093	7333296	Man, wouldn't it be sweet if there was a hidden American character and it was Obama?
7333316	7333396	Yeah.
7335592	7338075	What would be Obama's special power in this game?
7338735	7343660	Well, according to DJ Dark Knight in chat, a veto uppercut.
7345662	7348645	He would have all Sagats move, so he'd immediately be God tier.
7349066	7351468	And I mean, he would just be like, veto, veto.
7351548	7355292	I just had this image of Sagat, but actually it's Dick Cheney, like in a special movie, waterboarding.
7355733	7356153	Nice.
7356213	7357495	Or shooting you with a gun.
7357755	7358576	He was Dick Cheney.
7359656	7387223	He would start off like in Which game was it where Sagat started off holding Mike Dan and then he'd throw him aside but he'd start off and be like Bush Wasn't there like a guile move that it was a rumored guile move they'd pull out a pistol or something and shoot somebody That was like an urban fucking legend Some kid at the arcade knew a kid who saw a kid pull out a gun But now with Dick Cheney Yeah, Dick Cheney But he'd only shoot his partner in the face
7389193	7394697	Now, a hidden character in this, would Hillary Clinton come out of the woodwork and mix some shit up with this?
7394917	7395778	I don't know what her special character is.
7395818	7397979	Sarah Palin might come out.
7398219	7399700	Ariel Wolf shooting right there.
7400080	7404503	Here's the thing, the chatroom is quick to point out, there is an Obama Japan.
7406705	7408986	There is an Obama Japan, according to chat.
7409006	7411228	And I do remember seeing that on TV when he won.
7411268	7414410	They were showing how excited they were in Japan and all that, so...
7415600	7415860	All right.
7415900	7418601	Anyhow, if you want to join the festivities, chat.orangelauntrader.com.
7418621	7423163	And I apologize to the folks on Justin TV because I just clicked over there and I see like the chat is filling up there.
7423243	7427164	Like you have a death wishing says Excitebike64 is my favorite game on the N64.
7427484	7428085	It was a good game.
7428925	7430005	And sorry, guys.
7430205	7433667	It's just really hard for us to watch two chat rooms at the same time and do a show.
7433747	7435527	So sometimes Justin TV gets ignored.
7435708	7436228	So I apologize.
7436568	7439129	But definitely join our main chat room, chat.orangelauntrader.com.
7439149	7440989	We'll read more of your comments as we can.
7441630	7441890	All right.
7442630	7444851	Anyhow, let's get into some more gaming news, shall we, Jimmy?
7445945	7446145	Yes.
7446165	7447026	World of Warcraft!
7447046	7448288	There's gonna be some changes.
7448308	7453354	In the next World of Warcraft patch, we'll have some class changes, actually.
7453374	7453634	Again?
7466367	7473315	Um, there is a no more consumable ammunition for hunters, a boost of protection spec paladins.
7473376	7474056	For real?
7474317	7476319	Like you don't have to get arrows anymore or whatever?
7476659	7477621	That makes me happy.
7477801	7478702	That's strange.
7479557	7498380	Major improvements to the priest class, especially in group healing, general buffs for rogues and shamans, efficiency improvements for warriors and warlocks, with penalty for warriors changing stances being much lighter, plus mana regeneration being reined in across the board.
7499750	7501491	Somewhere in Arms Warrior is rejoicing.
7502472	7505453	You can actually find more information on it on WoW Insider.
7505693	7507174	They've got the specifics listed.
7508015	7514899	But basically, they're trying to just streamline all the classes, trying to bring all the tanking classes in line.
7516740	7518121	Basically, just trying to balance the game.
7518821	7521602	And also make the boss fights more challenging by...
7522843	7551234	decreasing the mana regeneration the content has not gone into testing yet it should be going in before the release in the next couple of months so keep your eyes out if any of our readers find out more let us know also in patch 3.1 there will be a new raid dungeon called Ulduar with an introduction of dual talent specializations thank god about fucking time that's the rumor
7551778	7554220	Matt2, do you think this will be enough to get me back to WoW?
7572762	7577166	Yes, short of me paying for your account again or whatever I have to do to get you playing back to the World of Warcraft.
7577226	7579989	I actually kind of think that I want to start playing again just for a little bit.
7580069	7580309	Yes.
7580389	7581811	Even though my last character was level 10.
7581851	7588477	But as Rob pointed out at the beginning of the show, all 20 of my characters, which is really 9 of them, are all Narzul.
7588738	7590239	Have you been gone for more than 3 months?
7591200	7595664	Let me get you a Scroll of Resurrection because then we can get the Uber item that lets us level up really quickly.
7595684	7596265	You'll get my scroll.
7597719	7598300	Stay strong.
7598500	7599301	Don't start playing again.
7621465	7625446	It's because it's not cool to say that things cause cancer because people are dying of cancer.
7625486	7627627	So I started saying that things cause cancer too.
7628227	7629948	Well, wow causes electric boogaloo.
7630008	7630628	It makes sense.
7630648	7634249	Wow causes electric boogaloo.
7634609	7635229	It's serious though.
7635289	7635929	Don't start playing.
7636109	7639510	You know so much more about games when you don't play wow.
7639730	7640231	That's true.
7640291	7642271	I play so many more games when I'm not playing wow.
7643151	7643812	You don't even know.
7643972	7644572	Sad trombone.
7644952	7645112	Low key.
7649202	7662541	Well, this is totally as far away from World of Warcraft as possible, but Battlefield 1943 is now slated to come out on Xbox Live Arcade, PC, and PlayStation Network this summer.
7663081	7665164	It is going to be based on the same engine as...
7665805	7679768	Bad Company, and will feature 24-player battles, and they had a few different maps, including Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima, which are based off of actual world locations.
7680169	7687390	I think they actually used some of the top topography maps and stuff like that for that.
7687830	7688971	Neat, I guess.
7689751	7692972	Also, around the same time, I believe they announced...
7694432	7697794	Was it Battlefield Bad Company 2 as well?
7698695	7703297	Because really, if gaming needed anything besides more MMORPGs, it's more FPSs.
7704998	7705539	Thank God.
7706059	7710221	I think, if I remember correctly, Bad Company 2 is right now for September.
7712263	7715284	Now, TigerClaw says it's nice for them to go back to the World War 2 roots.
7716105	7716345	Yeah.
7718464	7724207	Since obviously they can't really do the modern warfare stuff now because Call of Duty has owned it.
7725728	7729150	I do want to go back previously because this comment is pretty funny on the past story about WoW.
7729210	7734273	Ranma in chat says, WoW may not cause cancer, but it can cause breakups, cheating, and marriage counseling.
7736174	7736835	I have heard that.
7737855	7740037	But the family that raids together stays together.
7740937	7742918	Alright, that's my counter argument.
7743479	7744920	I am not going back to WoW.
7747124	7748205	I'm going to play Perfect World.
7748245	7749746	Because I said I was going to play Perfect World.
7749766	7751727	For 30 days and you'll come play WoW.
7751787	7754289	I've been off of WoW for how long?
7755410	7755671	Addict.
7756811	7757992	I'm not even playing right now.
7758032	7759974	Why am I trying to recruit people?
7759994	7763457	Because I know Matt2 is going to succeed in his efforts to try and get me back.
7763777	7764798	Yes, I am.
7765498	7765799	Anyhow.
7767160	7767860	You're a follower.
7767880	7768821	Going back to EA.
7769642	7770162	I am, really.
7771997	7773558	and their conference call they had.
7774239	7783747	News about Battlefield was not the only thing to come out of it and some of the things we talked about in Part A, but also Mass Effect has been confirmed that Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.
7783787	7785388	It's not going to be Xbox exclusive.
7785408	7787650	That's straight out of the mouth of CEO John Riccatello.
7788070	7790092	Mass Effect 2 is going to be multiple platform.
7790332	7796297	Also, Bad Company, the other Battlefield game, will be back on consoles in the year 2010.
7797758	7800841	So some point like January to March, but who knows.
7801181	7801621	Really?
7801701	7806384	I thought it was 2009, but I guess it's going to be delayed a lot more.
7806504	7807825	Probably even more than that.
7808266	7809066	What, Mass Effect?
7809826	7811788	No, the other one, the Battlefield Bad Company.
7812168	7816451	I thought Mass Effect was a Microsoft Game Studios-owned franchise.
7816611	7818472	I didn't think Bioware carried it over with them.
7818683	7821224	Well, here's the thing, and I bet BlackWolf in chat is right.
7821304	7822104	He's saying it right.
7822124	7823504	He's saying exactly what I'm thinking.
7823564	7826405	Multiple platform equals Xbox 360 and PC.
7827165	7828806	I bet you that's exactly what it is.
7829006	7830706	Doesn't mean suddenly we're going to see PS3.
7831327	7841450	And plus, we've also seen, you know, who knows, you might get a Mass Effect spinoff on the DS because we have seen that Microsoft is not opposed to letting their stuff go on, yeah, less effect.
7843330	7843911	Dual effect.
7844971	7848193	Seeing things go on the DS, Viva Pinata had a game on the DS.
7848253	7849854	So it's possible.
7850114	7852135	No, not Viva Pinata, Mecha Assault.
7853156	7857939	That would be an awesome game, like a mech game, but they're just giant pinatas.
7858059	7860841	Well, they've done Mecha Assault on the DS, and it was not very good.
7861121	7861681	But they did it.
7862662	7863922	It was a Microsoft franchise.
7865003	7865183	Huh?
7865403	7865643	Yeah.
7865683	7865984	They did it.
7866004	7867084	It was a Microsoft franchise.
7867825	7868205	It's all the same.
7869376	7896777	but I was completely different game but it's kind of big like some of these Mass Effect games Borderlands, I actually watched some gameplay footage of and that thing's going to be epic and I think it's going to catch a lot of people off guard because it's almost like Oblivion and Fallout with just a lot more fast paced first person gameplay and vehicles and Mad Max Alrighty then
7897588	7899330	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7918767	7921669	to sometime in early June.
7922130	7928234	They're actually speculating June 2nd with the non-PC versions being sometime later than that.
7930856	7940623	They're also saying that the games they'll be released on PC and Mac and iPhone, iPhone Touch and other mobiles.
7942684	7945026	But the release date only really goes for the PC version.
7946167	7948108	Oh well.
7949195	7949375	F.U.S.
7949655	7950795	of the Week
7990191	8010877	F you to my work for deciding that I need to help back up people on the phones even though I don't get a single damn call and it'll really suck because I've been having a really bad sore throat from my sinus infection so F you to the phones and talk to the people
8013297	8021242	FD the person that parks next to me at my apartment complex because they're parking right on the line and they haven't moved their car in like four days.
8021903	8025605	And so it makes it almost impossible for me to get out of my car.
8027006	8029788	I would really do some damage to their car, but someone's already keyed it.
8029888	8032270	So apparently they do this other places as well.
8032370	8034471	So fuck them.
8035958	8037379	I actually don't have a lot of FUs of the week.
8037439	8040560	I had a pretty good week, so FU to me being so happy, I suppose.
8040640	8046662	FU to, I'll say this, FU to sleeping in until noon and still feeling tired.
8047583	8047983	I hate that.
8048183	8058167	Have you ever had that where you sleep so freaking much, although that's not the case because I can go to bed until 5 last night, but I have had this happen before where you sleep so much that your eyes hurt and you're still tired.
8058747	8059527	I've had that happen.
8059947	8060508	That sucks.
8060708	8061128	FU to that.
8062294	8063735	Dan, do you have any FUs of the week you want to share?
8064195	8067296	FU to people who get bent about pushed release dates.
8067856	8069116	There's other shit to play.
8069996	8071037	Find a different game.
8071797	8072437	Seriously.
8073237	8075958	Those dates don't even exist for you.
8076178	8077838	Those are for retailers like me.
8078039	8081379	So I know when they're coming out and I know when to start pushing the product.
8081580	8083540	You're not even supposed to know them!
8083920	8084420	F you all.
8084920	8087181	Dan, we just have to work in this segment somewhere in the show.
8088221	8088742	You die.
8089242	8089942	You die twice.
8091229	8092470	I hope you get Electric Boogaloo.
8093791	8094672	FU to being alive.
8095993	8096593	Matt, too.
8096773	8098254	Do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to share?
8098274	8102598	I haven't thought this far ahead, but I guess FU to Weemageddon, the potential
8103208	8107250	and Penny Weemageddon that may cause more console wars with each other.
8107710	8111612	And the Jerry Breckenheimer movie that will follow called Weemageddon.
8111632	8112013	That's right.
8112033	8113333	Whatever his name is.
8113353	8114634	It'll make millions upon millions of dollars.
8115034	8120657	But I do agree that there are two main primary consoles in the Wii for that one special demographic.
8121258	8123239	F you to you for stealing my stolen work.
8124299	8127701	F you because you thought of that first and I happened to say it.
8128919	8129579	That's not even copyright.
8129599	8130039	That's what I said.
8130099	8132020	I stole it, and then you stole it from me.
8132180	8133020	Alright, F you both.
8133040	8134100	And you stole it from him.
8134420	8134860	F you both.
8134880	8135780	We're getting back into the news.
8135900	8137260	Loki doesn't even want it anymore.
8137560	8137841	Alright.
8137861	8139361	We'll add a prefix to F you.
8139621	8140361	S-T-F-U.
8141821	8142421	Oh, snap.
8144062	8144382	Alright.
8144982	8145402	Loki.
8145782	8146882	Do we have any more gaming news?
8146942	8147382	I hope so.
8147642	8147942	Yes.
8148062	8150903	I was going to say, I'm going to now copyright Super Weemageddon.
8156644	8157644	The Super Weemageddon.
8159710	8162985	Well, a game that will not be featured on the Super Wii Mageddon 64 will be...
8166147	8167527	Puzzle Quest Galactrix.
8167867	8168208	Really?
8168228	8171608	Because they do manage to port those Puzzle Quest games to everything.
8171628	8172249	It is sad.
8172389	8174449	It could be on Super Wii Mageddon 64 already.
8174529	8178270	It will be coming out on DS, PC, Xbox Live Arcade.
8179810	8183691	Apparently the PC version is coming around on February 24th.
8184031	8188973	The Xbox Live Arcade date is unconfirmed, but you know me being the guessing man that I am.
8189793	8193154	I would say since the... I don't know.
8193614	8193974	Maybe...
8197951	8199012	Puzzle Quest is cool.
8199112	8201214	I was really afraid you were going to say it was cancelled.
8201735	8202356	It's cancelled.
8202636	8203196	No.
8203717	8204718	What, no Atari 2600 port?
8204798	8207961	It's cancelled for Christmas, and Christmas is cancelled as well.
8208822	8209903	Puzzle Quest is awesome.
8209923	8210543	Happy Hanukkah!
8210563	8213166	Although where the Galactrix thing comes from, I don't even know.
8213868	8218111	Galactrix comes from the fact that the game is different and it's set in space now.
8219733	8221194	And they changed the engine.
8221254	8223255	Now it's the whole hexagonal thing.
8223315	8224817	But it's pretty cool, actually.
8224837	8226878	If you've played the demo, it's pretty addicting, I think.
8227178	8231902	Just put friggin' Puzzle Pirates on Xbox Live Arcade games.
8232242	8233043	Seriously.
8233764	8234444	Seriously.
8234564	8236586	It's really meant to be a portable game, though.
8237186	8239648	Puzzle Pirates would be an awesome DS, like MMO.
8239928	8242310	I can't see playing Puzzle Quest on my 360s.
8243393	8245371	But I could totally see playing that on the PSP.
8247970	8261781	Also out of EA, some other news, it's not related to Puzzle Quest, but one other little piece of news that's out of EA, apparently they are now going to be getting the Bourne series over there, or I guess what's going on, it's not just really the Bourne.
8262081	8266364	What's happened, they've picked up the rights to publish games that are based on Robert Ludlam stories.
8266464	8268846	He is the guy who made the Jason Bourne series.
8270187	8273390	Apparently the first game in the series is going to be made by Starbreeze Studios.
8273590	8276012	No word on exactly what that game is, but
8276192	8276652	Matt Damon!
8294451	8299073	They all do very well, yes, because of Matt Damon.
8300353	8301954	What other books has he written?
8301994	8305455	I mean, I'm not really familiar with... It is a Bourne title they're working on, by the way.
8305475	8308696	I'll start with The Bourne and end with, like, something.
8309216	8310697	The Bourne Cakery.
8313278	8313658	Nice.
8315178	8315618	Okay.
8315839	8316859	The Bourne Cooking Mama.
8316999	8317499	No, I don't know.
8317739	8318860	So, there you have it.
8318980	8322741	EA has picked up the Bourne rights and who knows what else from the same author.
8324350	8325851	The Bourne Oven.
8326351	8330012	I like this idea of picking up rights to authors' stories, though.
8330192	8331773	Could you imagine J.D.
8331813	8332993	Salinger rights getting picked up?
8333013	8334493	We'd have the Catcher in the Rye game.
8334513	8336334	Hey, we've had Discworld games before.
8337254	8338435	Roald Dahl gets picked up.
8338475	8341076	We could finally have Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, the game.
8341496	8342836	It'd be pretty amazing.
8345117	8349658	It was certainly better than that shit-tastic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory game they put out a couple years ago.
8349678	8351219	I'm picking up the rights to the Bible.
8353863	8356864	Sorry, those little offshoot companies already did Bible Adventures.
8356904	8357505	Hello.
8360666	8363207	I don't know if, like, God's rights are for sale.
8364548	8365888	I pick the... Call it a thought.
8366908	8371350	I pick the... I'm so glad you didn't have a mic when you said that.
8371590	8377293	I pick the rights to the Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster game.
8378852	8380934	I am going to do a Flying Spaghetti Monster game.
8381194	8384736	Fine, I'm buying the rights to the articles in Playboy.
8386518	8392662	Seriously, if you want to make a badass game, license the Oblivion Engine and the Bible.
8393162	8394143	And just combine them.
8395044	8396705	How fucking nuts would that be?
8396985	8399907	Or as Frisbee puts in the chat, SuperChristPuncher64.
8404754	8406875	FlyingSpaghettiMonster
8432008	8461308	Final Fantasy VII, Advent Children I said not religion For some people, Final Fantasy VII is a religion Because people need lives At any rate, the Blu-ray edition of the movie will have a dub soundtrack Which is why I'm importing that bitch And not because Final Fantasy XIII demo is going to be on there at all Oh no, not for that or anything
8462318	8463138	No, never for that.
8463538	8464859	No, it's going to have it option.
8465779	8467520	I do want the Final Fantasy XIII demo.
8469420	8476983	But it actually, if you do buy that Blu-ray version though, it's going to have the English voice track.
8477963	8481405	Did you download the HD Final Fantasy XIII trailer on PlayStation 3?
8483385	8483565	No.
8483825	8486646	I seriously think I got a boner from watching that trailer.
8486706	8487447	It was pretty hot.
8487867	8488127	Noise.
8490808	8493812	I'm hearing way too much about cocks on this show tonight.
8495253	8497016	At least we've had a mention of boobs.
8499138	8502102	Speaking of cocks, Guns N' Roses Chinese...
8506707	8509550	Wow, Loki just won Best Transition Ever.
8509570	8510591	Congratulations.
8511371	8515976	Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy album is coming to Rock Band this spring.
8517737	8520560	Yeah, no word on the price, but it's coming.
8520580	8523282	Don't worry, it's going to be delayed.
8524643	8527186	It's going to be coming, actually, February 28th, so...
8529529	8538916	And then, also, Rock Band is going to be getting some new download content with the re-release of Pearl Jam's 10 album.
8539357	8544081	They're going to have a code for three bonus tracks in Rock Band.
8544721	8545922	Brother Alive and State of Love and Trust
8561855	8564477	Rock Band has cost themselves some serious cool points.
8564837	8569701	First was the janky way you had to pay $40 for ACDC Live, which you can get for $30 now.
8570201	8572322	The second is the whole Chinese democracy thing.
8572863	8573303	Come on.
8573763	8576265	Quit trying to stuff these giant packs on us.
8576805	8577526	It's terrible.
8577806	8578346	Terrible stuff.
8578607	8579527	Making us buy CDs.
8579727	8580828	Just put them up on the network.
8581008	8581349	Come on.
8581529	8586392	The Chinese democracy thing is going to be on the network.
8586412	8587553	Yeah, but see, that just sucks.
8587873	8588453	I'm excited about Pearl Jam.
8588473	8589873	That is their single best and only fantastic album.
8618936	8625942	That is one of the last CDs that I have ever owned that every damn track on it was fantastic.
8625962	8628104	Can we seriously get a Journey album right now?
8628164	8628784	No shit.
8629785	8630326	Seriously?
8630346	8632127	And it's not that Pearl Jam isn't good.
8632347	8633588	It's just that Journey's better.
8633849	8634129	Right.
8634489	8638552	But I don't want to buy 10 again so I can get three rock band songs.
8638892	8642355	And yes, there's an egregious dearth of Journey.
8642915	8644396	There needs to be way more of it.
8645137	8646978	Every Journey song would be great.
8647539	8647959	For real.
8647999	8650461	That's what they need to be selling at Walmart is the Journey game.
8650481	8651522	What is the one that's on...
8653725	8655966	Anyway you want it, that's the way you need it.
8655986	8659407	That's great, but I mean, there's so more, so much more.
8659687	8670590	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and you know, you know we love our music game roots, and we have to mention music games whenever we see new ones, but I don't know if this one exactly would qualify.
8670650	8672491	It's a game called D-Pad Hero.
8672991	8679993	That's right, there's so much love out there for Guitar Hero and everything that this whole thing started that they have actually made a
8680573	8681854	Retro D-Make.
8682154	8682834	Not a remake.
8682994	8683654	I don't know how you feel.
8683915	8684675	I know you love remakes.
8684695	8686236	I don't know how you feel about D-Makes, though.
8687276	8688176	D-Pad Hero.
8688496	8688837	That's right.
8688877	8691658	It's Guitar Hero, but you use the D-Pad to play the game.
8692278	8696560	And actually, there's actually a little video that leaked on YouTube here.
8696740	8700521	I shouldn't say leaked, but they actually put it out here kind of showing how the game works.
8700702	8706284	If you're hearing the noises in the background there, that's what I'm trying to load here in studio, although it's kind of having a hard time buffering.
8707004	8709126	I was so sure you said D-Bag Hero at first.
8709747	8710928	Like Douchebag Hero?
8713530	8716033	I don't think that would play exactly the same way.
8716053	8716834	I was like, what?
8717214	8718155	Oh, okay.
8719056	8722119	No, not D-Bag Hero, D-Pad Hero.
8722139	8722459	Sorry.
8724554	8725434	Annunciate.
8726075	8727255	Or I just need to clean my ears or something.
8727395	8729896	Anyhow, I don't know why the video's not working, but it's not.
8729936	8734618	But apparently you have all these different... But the thing is, is that you actually... You guys know he's making that up, right?
8734638	8737879	You actually get these music things in NES style.
8737959	8743341	So it actually has, you know, speaking of Guns N' Roses, Sweet Child of Mine, that you can actually play in, like, it's NES style.
8743441	8744661	So there you go.
8744762	8748203	I really want to see if we can get a... Because they actually have this, too.
8748223	8748463	They have...
8749841	8753784	They have Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger in this game as well by Daft Punk.
8753805	8756347	Let me see if one of these other videos will work here a little better.
8759450	8765655	Let's see, here's a little... And these little things fall down.
8765695	8769538	Looks like you actually hold the D-pad in a certain direction when you push the button.
8769598	8771380	So it does have a little bit of a challenge to it.
8772341	8774303	And there actually is a little audience that rocks out.
8774323	8776725	Like see, there's like one guy bobbing up and down there in the background.
8781061	8782102	This song is awesome.
8784485	8786887	This is actually a pretty faithful remake of the song.
8791812	8795196	And Amaze Hatsuma in chat says, once teabag hero.
8795456	8798519	I don't know about that.
8798559	8800281	Featuring an all Madonna soundtrack.
8800321	8800661	I don't know.
8801762	8802663	I don't know about that.
8803584	8803985	All right.
8804753	8805133	New York Comic Con
8835810	8837751	Well, I had a lot of fun.
8837871	8842414	I mean, this is the first Comic-Con I went to, because this is the first time I've been back in New York for a long time.
8842514	8852160	But Comic-Con has kind of turned itself into a normal comic convention, into just a whole geek fest of everything.
8853521	8857364	And now, this year, they kind of expanded the game section.
8857664	8860486	So now half the convention is more so video game stuff.
8860762	8864451	They had a lot of new games there that I was excited to play.
8867116	8867536	That's cool.
8867576	8872461	Sounds like it's practically turning into the San Diego Comic-Con, because they don't really talk about comics at the San Diego.
8872541	8875203	No, they do, but a lot of it is Hollywood panels.
8875684	8880268	When I heard there was a Sarah Silverman show panel at Comic-Con, I'm like, what the fuck does that have to do with comics?
8880388	8880748	Nothing.
8881749	8884031	We read comic books, so we should have a panel.
8884191	8885012	I don't know.
8885072	8888195	Comic-Con has long since been perverted away from comics.
8888235	8888735	Apparently.
8888956	8889476	But that's okay.
8889516	8891458	We like gaming, so that's pretty cool.
8893659	8904142	And I just want to point out, guys, as well, since we are kind of getting used to this whole new Skype setup, they can't hear the Skype calls on Justin.TV, and that's just one of the downsides to the way things are wired now and having the better sound quality.
8904162	8909564	So sadly, if you want to hear both ends of the call, you have to be tuned in to All Games Radio where we're tuning in live.
8909584	8909964	Sorry, guys.
8909984	8913565	We'll see if we can fix that in the future, but can't do it right now while we're on a call.
8914245	8915265	So tell us about the types.
8915545	8917206	What games did you guys get out there and actually play?
8918114	8923296	Well, there were, actually, you know, to tell you the truth, it was very, very easy to play a lot of the games.
8923416	8928998	I was surprised because, you know, I went there on Saturday where it was a busy, busy day where everyone was there.
8929898	8941383	So, I actually, you know, I had to wait about like 15 minutes probably per game to hit up a game, but, you know, I could spend the entire call talking about every single game there, but I'll just talk about three.
8942083	8942463	Okay.
8943504	8946825	The three that I got a chance to play were
8947455	8950157	MadWorld, which is coming out for the Wii.
8952319	8957443	If anyone hasn't seen it, it's kind of like if Sin City was a Wii game.
8958804	8959465	Interesting.
8960346	8963969	So this is a nice departure from Wii Mageddon, which has been talked about earlier.
8964289	8965230	I've heard about this game before.
8965270	8966070	MadWorld, Dan?
8966211	8966651	MadWorld.
8966671	8968332	We got to check it out last September.
8968913	8971715	It's pretty hardcore for a Wii game.
8973601	8977244	It's kind of got a Killer7 vibe, if anyone's checked out Killer7.
8977765	8979907	But it's hyper-violent.
8980087	8984190	It's all black and white except for when you're laying out some carnage and then you get a lot of blood.
8985852	8987913	Definitely one of the coolest titles for the Wii.
8987973	8988654	What did you think, Matt?
8990876	8991597	I thought it was great.
8991637	8996361	You know, the first... They had a challenge in the game where...
8997836	9025420	you basically have to shove guys into a pit and every couple minutes a giant thing just drops down and crushes everything in the pit so it was funny like every single time you throw a guy in they get crushed like a pool of blood slowly fills up and more guys you throw in there they start drowning in the blood it's a pretty brutal game you know it might get me to buy a Wii game interesting alright that's a pretty hearty endorsement what else did you check out?
9026716	9033643	Another game which I think Loki would be interested in is Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars for the DS.
9034224	9035686	I heard this was out on the floor.
9035726	9036306	What did you think?
9038328	9044395	When I originally heard they were going to make a Grand Theft Auto DS game, I was kind of skeptical, but
9045436	9046696	One, I got a chance to play it.
9046736	9050417	I got to admit, it's a pretty good game.
9051097	9058499	It kind of goes back to the old top-down GTAs, like GTA 2.
9059059	9063460	The animation is very smooth and everything.
9064540	9066201	It's got a lot of cute gimmicks in it.
9067481	9072482	If you're calling for a cab, you basically whistle into the DS for the cab.
9074463	9103961	it's got a lot of cool things like that is there any special thing for like when you want to like get the hooker to blow you in the shooter you gotta like hold some money up in front of it and crinkle the dollars together seriously though if you want to see what Grand Theft Auto is going to look like when it's like on Nintendo 64 there you go Chinatown Wars baby they got a little thing in there where it's like Dope Wars if you kind of remember that from old handheld calculators and all that
9104913	9106014	Dope Wars was awesome.
9109177	9112500	Loki, anything you want to say about the Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars?
9112600	9114161	I'm planning on playing it.
9114802	9115502	What was the third game?
9116844	9122669	The third game, which I consider was the best game there, was the Ghostbusters game.
9124390	9125711	I've heard some good things about this.
9125751	9127172	Tell us a little bit about the Ghostbusters game.
9127213	9127593	What's it like?
9128732	9133416	Well, what they had, well, you know, it's kind of like what everyone seems to think it is.
9133536	9137199	It looks, it feels like Gears of War, but with Ghostbusters.
9138239	9139520	What version did they have there?
9140882	9141802	They had every single version.
9141822	9144825	They had the PS3, the 360, and the Wii version.
9144845	9147527	The Wii version is the only one that looks different.
9147567	9153291	It kind of, like, looks a little more cartoony than the others, but it's just as fun.
9153551	9155693	So, I managed to get to play the Wii and the 360, so.
9158735	9167819	See, I heard that the Wii was like an FPS version where you use your remote to capture ghosts and your nunchuck for movement.
9168280	9171961	And yeah, the 360 version is more like a third-person shooter.
9173102	9175983	Yeah, you basically use the nunchuck to throw the trap.
9176764	9178925	That's awesome.
9181266	9185248	Well, Matt, I've been letting you do all the talking, but Ranma, did you go too?
9185308	9186008	What did you check out?
9187148	9191050	Well, I was mostly in the dealer's room, but I was able to check out one game.
9191350	9195473	I think it's a game that everybody loves, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time.
9195893	9200456	It was there to celebrate the 25th shelliversary of the Ninja Turtles.
9201072	9202253	The Shelliversary.
9203033	9207535	I heard there was like an old school Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine there.
9207795	9208976	Yes, there was.
9209076	9212477	And there was crowds upon crowds for people to jump in and play.
9212797	9222342	Isn't that sad that with like all these new games that are making their debut there, like, you know, you have what, like Jumpgate and Prototype and Mad World and WrestleMania and Conduit.
9222742	9226663	People are like lining up to play TMNT 2, the arcade game.
9226783	9228184	Because quality persists.
9228204	9228604	For real.
9228624	9228944	Damn right.
9228964	9229765	That's an amazing game.
9230998	9232274	I'd be in line playing that.
9234184	9234965	Ooh, Star Trek Online.
9261665	9262586	Supernova 2 New York Con New Turtles
9282649	9287073	The new Turtles game, I'm not sure if they had it on out front.
9287293	9287934	I didn't think so.
9288174	9289315	They just kept advertising it.
9289415	9292418	I do know it's pretty much from the people that did on Smash Bros.
9292478	9295020	Bro, so I think this is going to be a good title that they're working on.
9295901	9296421	Well, we'll see.
9296461	9299864	I'm a little skeptical because some of the Teenage Mutant Turtles games are kind of ass, but we'll see.
9300005	9301085	Did anybody see Hawks?
9302327	9302947	It was on display.
9302967	9303708	Yeah, I got to play Hawks.
9304188	9306110	How was it?
9306750	9309012	It's like a very polished Ace Combat.
9309233	9309513	Sweet.
9311169	9312610	and yeah, it's a lot of fun.
9312851	9314112	I like shooting things with jets.
9314972	9318876	Alright, so really quickly guys, then we're going to let you go because we've got to get some more calls because we're kind of running long tonight.
9319176	9321438	But best thing you saw at Comic-Con.
9322199	9322479	Matt.
9324200	9329685	Aside from the Ghostbusters game, this new game called Prototype, which is coming out for the 360 and
9332684	9360494	it's everything what Spider-Man Web of Shadows should have been it's just really brutal and free roam New York City mutant thing, it's really great alright, and Ranma, best thing it has to be a tie number one, the Ninja Turtles arcade machine and number two, the attempt at breaking the Guinness Book of World Records for the biggest amount of video game cosplayers in one setting did you break it?
9361804	9362024	No.
9362244	9362745	The record was 342.
9362785	9365406	There was 90 of us.
9366947	9367227	Oh.
9367247	9367847	Street Fighter 4 there?
9367867	9368508	Maybe next year.
9369288	9370929	I suppose I think it was.
9370969	9371609	I don't know.
9372009	9372530	I didn't see it.
9372570	9374951	Wasn't your favorite?
9375251	9375571	Wait, what?
9376251	9378252	You're saying Street Fighter 4 was there and it wasn't your favorite?
9379653	9379933	Okay.
9380253	9381574	Well, I didn't see it there.
9382315	9382715	Runtime.
9383495	9383735	Yes.
9383875	9384936	We need to do that at Fonamay.
9386981	9391522	I was going to talk to him and see if we can get that done because that title's got to come back to the US.
9392482	9393603	We need to do this in front of me.
9394703	9395403	Break the records.
9395723	9401665	Before I go, if you see pictures of us at the video game shoot, you'll be seeing me in the background holding up a giant Super NES.
9402965	9403265	Nice.
9404745	9406206	Actually, two quick last things.
9406346	9408626	I'm posting pictures in the chat regularly.
9408886	9409787	Awesome.
9410467	9412467	Also, one very last thing.
9412627	9415148	Expect a care package of swag.
9416070	9418292	Oh, you guys are the best.
9419132	9420293	I love the fans.
9420533	9422655	We don't even have to go to these events and we get goodies.
9422955	9423215	Love it.
9423535	9424356	Thank you guys so much.
9425236	9425777	Not a problem.
9425797	9426457	Have a good one, kids.
9426717	9427078	See you later.
9427238	9428539	All right.
9428979	9434503	Speaking of our fans doing nice stuff for us, I would like to personally thank IkumaJP for the box of puka.
9435023	9439026	Which, by the way, I do still have some of the nom-noms in the house if you guys want some of the nom-noms.
9439126	9440086	All right, we're going to go to the phones.
9440126	9441007	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9441027	9441347	Who's this?
9442608	9444109	Hi, this is Spazinator.
9444269	9445270	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?
9446939	9447960	Two quick questions.
9449560	9459685	With the Xbox 360, do you know if there's a hard drive available that's bigger than 120 gigs?
9460705	9461145	Not yet.
9461726	9462946	It's just a matter of time, though.
9465967	9471530	The reason I ask is because I hate to see it, but my hard drive is running out of space as it is.
9471550	9471790	Also,
9474867	9485589	Secondly, can you think of any retro games that you would like to see released for any one of those three systems, or are you pretty much all set?
9485729	9488930	I'm sorry, run that by me one more time?
9488950	9500812	You know, while retro games are kind of big, and they're constantly getting released for all three of those systems, whether it be Wii, Virtual Console, the PlayStation 3, or...
9502466	9504027	and XBLA.
9504147	9510549	Can you think of any game that you would like to see released for Y03 or are you pretty much all set?
9511490	9512150	Mega Man 10.
9513391	9515131	What, that will be released or that was released?
9517352	9519613	You would like to see released.
9520674	9522234	Mega Man 10 at some point would be awesome.
9522274	9526476	As long as they stay with the Mega Man 9 series and do a Mega Man 10, that'd be great.
9526676	9531218	Mega Man 9 was awesome for all three systems but of course was the best on the Wii because it was just the most...
9532261	9535726	Authentic, retro, like new retro experience.
9537208	9544158	I'm surprised that, I mean, I'm not surprised, but Bionic Commando Rearmed would be really nice on the Wii, you know, if they decided to do it.
9547016	9564890	I really think the game that needs to be remade that was out before its time and I mean I know that I hate this game and I hate the fanboys for it you know like although I approve of fanboyism and go for it love what you love I really think that the game that needs a remake needs it for anything powerful enough to run it is Final Fantasy 7
9565836	9566756	Yeah, I definitely agree with you.
9566776	9568417	I'd love to see a remake of VII, you know, because...
9591954	9593115	I used to love that game.
9593135	9596518	Unfortunately, I don't have my copy of it anymore.
9596578	9600201	So, you know, if they ever do release the game again, you know.
9600661	9602142	Make it for anything but the DS.
9603143	9606706	You know, because the DS would just basically be able to do it as it originally was.
9609008	9610969	Well, thank you for taking my call.
9611169	9612290	You are welcome.
9613891	9614512	You have a good one.
9614692	9615433	Take care, Spazinator.
9615453	9615833	Have a good one.
9617335	9620237	I don't know if Final Fantasy 7 would fit on Xbox Live Arcade.
9620297	9622438	That's the only problem I see going on with that.
9622478	9623038	But who knows?
9623179	9623439	We'll see.
9623459	9626240	Because you know if they wanted to make it, Microsoft wouldn't make an exception.
9626340	9626701	We'll see.
9626781	9627801	Alright, we got another call.
9627921	9630763	Hello, this is DSMaster25.
9630943	9631864	Hi, what's on your mind?
9633665	9634325	Not much.
9634786	9638268	I got a PSP 2000, but it's kind of fluky on me.
9638328	9639308	I buy it used.
9640669	9646332	Wait, I find this ironic because your name is DSMaster yet I'm looking at your logo on Skype and your call is about a PSP.
9647438	9648999	Please explain.
9649619	9653861	Basically, I was desperate for one because I wanted Skype and everything.
9654441	9656762	So I figured, why not buy a PSP?
9656842	9658443	So basically I did.
9659143	9660783	You wanted what game?
9661464	9663885	I wanted to use Skype, reportedly.
9664545	9669907	But the Skype zones were not in America, so the only other option was a PSP.
9671688	9672528	Interesting.
9672628	9672968	Okay.
9672989	9676490	So basically, I bought one used.
9676980	9686162	Now I have this crack in my screen, and now my start button, my select button, my home button, all that doesn't work.
9686982	9688943	It sounds like you have a broken PSP.
9689703	9692303	I would recommend replacing it with a new working one.
9692563	9697665	Preferably a 3000 series, because if you want to use Skype... He said he bought it used.
9697725	9698285	I'm curious.
9698325	9699665	Did you buy it used at GameStop?
9699685	9699785	Yes.
9699925	9700345	Sad trombone.
9708769	9713751	Well, did you buy it like that, or did you buy it nice and you've made it like that?
9714572	9716813	Because if you bought it like that, take that puppy back.
9717293	9719855	Hopefully you were smart enough to buy the extended service on it.
9721936	9727719	Unfortunately, I was dead broke by the time I bought the PSP, so I didn't have any money to buy the extended service.
9727879	9729400	I was pretty much screwed.
9729420	9731741	What was wrong with the PSP now?
9731761	9733422	This is just a sad trombone call.
9736840	9738825	Basically, the home button.
9745001	9753428	The volume buttons The screen brightness I'll repeat what I said Do they not test these things?
9753528	9765458	I mean, do they not notice Scratch on the screen Or a big crack on the screen I mean, because I know when you have to go trade stuff in There's like, does this shit work?
9765578	9773885	Well, and here's the deal You're about to get an education As to the inside workings of used game stores They get ranked
9775226	9778109	On how much they get traded in.
9778229	9780391	So a lot of times they'll let crap slide.
9780772	9782894	And then they get ranked on selling you stuff.
9783214	9785716	So they're going to try to foist it on you.
9786397	9791002	Now there are game stores like mine where if you bring me a system, man, I'm looking for a reason to say no.
9791042	9792143	Because I'm a jerk.
9793298	9794599	Thanks for watching!
9814588	9815169	Thank you for watching!
9837165	9837546	and many more.
9858194	9861937	and then maybe they'll get some good people in there and you can have another good game store.
9862738	9867022	Orange Dawn Strider does not actually endorse this thing.
9867142	9869564	They may not endorse it officially but you know they're all down with it.
9870385	9871026	I'm down with it.
9873308	9879934	So what you're telling me is basically go back in there because my 30 day guarantee is already passed.
9880493	9882655	Because I bought this on December 22nd.
9883656	9886478	Otherwise, you know, the buttons and stuff not working?
9886558	9889480	I mean, which buttons are not working on there?
9889520	9897367	The home button, the volume buttons, the screen brightness, and the sound equalizer.
9897787	9899408	Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
9899869	9900790	Stop, stop, you guys.
9901250	9903612	Okay, so basically all the buttons on that bottom row, right?
9903792	9906054	Yeah, except for start.
9906094	9907375	That's the only one that works.
9908317	9908837	Thanks for watching!
9929528	9934954	Now, if you chopped it game crazy, we give you a 90-day guarantee without you even paying any extra money.
9935134	9935875	Nice, nice.
9935995	9936756	Now, here's the thing.
9936776	9937837	Plug, plug, plug.
9937858	9939660	For what it's worth, your call sounds great.
9940936	9942958	And it'll be funny with the PSP system.
9943979	9949945	I don't know if you could do one on them where you buy a new system and swap it for the broken one.
9951066	9952467	You sold me a busted system.
9952607	9958393	They're serial numbered, but I mean, you know, if you want to try a fast one that's on you, I can't tell you to do that or not tell you to do that.
9958413	9960755	That's up to your quality of being a human being.
9962096	9965419	But, oh, hey, I won't say I've never done anything like that.
9966727	9970616	I think I'm going to wait until I get money and then I'm going to buy a 3000.
9973435	9973855	Go back.
9973995	9976356	And then I'll use this one for emulators.
9976736	9978516	That's a good idea.
9978636	9989218	I think the advice, too, would just be, you know what, go in, anyone else that finds themselves in this situation, go in, be nice about it, don't be a dick, because no manager is going to want to do favors for you if you're a dick.
9989638	9992638	Go in, be nice about it, and see if they'll do a favor for you.
9992758	9994219	And if not, run them over with your car.
9994419	9995519	But your other idea was great.
9995879	9998580	Especially if, like Loki says, there's a ribbon cable in there.
9998740	10000140	If you like taking crap apart...
10001560	10005144	and you're out of warranty and can't get any help, take that puppy apart.
10005465	10006906	PSPs are awesome inside.
10007807	10009690	There's all sorts of cool stuff you can do with them.
10010150	10014535	You can like blow up their batteries and like lose pieces, change the color of the buttons.
10014635	10016137	I mean, just turn them into lasers.
10016858	10017619	Yeah.
10018596	10019677	Thank you for watching!
10039048	10043771	That might be the issue, because all of a sudden the buttons won't just die, it's the ribbon cable.
10044151	10046853	One of the janky things about used PSPs you gotta watch out for.
10046893	10053138	No, but basically what happened was, I bought it and all the bottom row buttons were working just fine.
10053918	10059081	And then a month or so after, I was listening to you guys in the shower, okay?
10059342	10060342	Oh, so now it's our fault.
10063597	10088708	basically I'm trying to change the volume and I'm reaching through the shower curtain and I think I might drop some water but I don't know okay now wait a minute now this is all on you buddy you broke your PSP okay keep this one for you in the shower and keep it away from the water I'm just curious is this an OLM verse that you've been listening to in the shower I'm just curious
10090419	10096345	If you do want to use it in the shower, they do sell waterproof cases you can put on the PSP.
10096545	10100168	Alright, DSMaster, we gotta let you go to get some more calls.
10100188	10101309	I'm just saying, if that's your thing.
10101329	10102410	Were you all soapy?
10102670	10109897	DSMaster, good luck to you.
10110498	10114001	If you do get a new PSP, keep it out of the bathtub.
10114693	10121315	Oh, by the way, the only reason why I bought this one was because I was speculating about the scan lines on the 3000 model.
10121515	10123396	Now I figured it's not so dangerous.
10123436	10124816	It's all the same, it just has a lock.
10125676	10126637	Alright.
10126737	10130498	Good luck, PSP, DS Master, whoever you are, and have a good one, okay?
10130938	10132678	Alright, bye.
10133018	10133218	Later.
10133559	10134959	I don't know if that guy's ever called in before.
10134999	10137260	I might have been a first-time caller, so that was a good call.
10138460	10138940	I like the...
10142848	10143569	Oh, good times.
10144009	10146630	We'll try to do at least one more call here and then wrap up the show.
10146970	10148311	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10148331	10148772	Who's this?
10149552	10150252	It's Deathwishing.
10150593	10152554	Well, hi, Deathwishing.
10152874	10154235	You're a first-time caller too, aren't you?
10154795	10155996	Yep.
10156476	10156956	What's on your mind?
10158897	10164461	I'm kind of disappointed with a lot of stuff I see in this year for gaming.
10165501	10166602	In this year of gaming?
10166642	10167883	In 2009 in gaming?
10168283	10168723	How so?
10168823	10170624	Just because it seems like there's nothing to look forward to?
10170644	10171885	I know it just started, but like...
10172921	10175303	It's just, I don't know, this summer seems a lot more droughted.
10175643	10178385	Like, I can already tell this summer's going to be a major drought for gaming.
10178825	10181888	Do you think it might be that everybody's trying to keep it in their pants until E3?
10182088	10189674	That's kind of one thing I've been trying to tell myself, as much as I might be lying to myself, is that maybe people are trying to keep it in their pants until E3.
10189754	10193877	You gotta remember, games and game developers are like plants.
10195218	10196339	And their water is money.
10197079	10198560	And there's no money out there right now.
10199161	10200742	So, things are quiet.
10200822	10200862	Um...
10203032	10206153	You gotta actually think, this summer there's not gonna be crap anyway.
10207414	10221979	You gotta look towards the fourth quarter and, you know, they're not gonna be making announcements about the fourth quarter until mid-spring when they've gotten through the Street Fighter 4 and the Resident Evils and the Killzone 2s because we got some... I mean, if you actually think about it, this is a great spring for games.
10222559	10224140	There are some just...
10224840	10227221	Nice, AAA titles for every system.
10228281	10231162	Nintendo had a great Christmas, at least in the States, with the Wii.
10231222	10233042	I know they're having a lot of trouble in Japan.
10234923	10243225	But really, I think that, you know, if you look at a lot of the release lists and whatnot, there's a lot of cool stuff coming out for everybody.
10243866	10244786	Skip the summer.
10244986	10248527	There'll be a big title or two, but I mean, it's not going to blow any wind up your skirt.
10248687	10250448	And then just start.
10251148	10251668	Oh, God.
10252088	10253408	Look to the fourth quarter, man.
10254028	10255269	That's where all the big games are.
10255369	10259869	Dan does have a point because our economy is in such shit right now in the U.S.
10259909	10260890	I don't know if you're calling for the U.S.
10260910	10271792	or wherever, but the thing is that it seems like on this show, week after week after week, we've been reporting this studio has closed, this studio has closed, this studio has closed.
10272072	10275072	So, damn, we're kind of lucky to be getting any games at all at this point.
10275132	10276913	But, you know, I do kind of agree.
10277053	10279053	I feel that same frustration as it's like, you know,
10279733	10280333	Thanks for watching!
10304413	10305433	Gamers get spoiled.
10305493	10307635	They expect big releases every month.
10307695	10310377	Maybe because Hollywood spoils us.
10310597	10312018	There's a big movie every week.
10312239	10316462	So don't get me started on movie chains.
10316602	10321305	You're not in the first two years of any console's development cycle now.
10322246	10325689	They've all proven what they have to prove, except for Sony.
10325709	10326569	Look at Sony's lineup.
10329952	10331294	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10345137	10346178	and so on.
10369933	10370794	Thanks for watching!
10389196	10391799	But there's Ryu and Ken and one's Hadouken and one's Hadouken.
10391819	10392680	I got a Hadouken.
10393000	10395002	It's going to take off a third of your life.
10395403	10398386	Mike Tyson takes off all your life with one punch.
10399388	10403853	And if you don't dodge all those punches, you can't even block them.
10403913	10404874	He makes Shang Long look like a sissy.
10407617	10408297	You know what we have now?
10408337	10410057	We have Obama with the veto uppercut.
10411298	10415438	I fought Akuma last night in HD Remix, and I got beat uncontrollably hard.
10415859	10416899	But at least I could hit him.
10417199	10418359	Mike Tyson, punch out.
10418539	10419479	Your ass is grass.
10419959	10423160	Put in 007-373-5963 in the password.
10423560	10424380	Fight Mike Tyson.
10424640	10428001	If you beat him, then I'm going to give you your props.
10428981	10429221	All right.
10429441	10433022	Wait, let me ask this as well real quick for what it's worth.
10434002	10434402	Are you a 360 owner?
10436260	10436981	Yes, I do own a 360.
10437021	10440383	Does it still work?
10440463	10444867	Okay, honestly, I'm on my second 360 and I had it from release.
10445796	10446817	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10467973	10494011	and you know when you consider that in the retail world you know we get poop as well like Fusion Frenzy and that fucking Crosswords game that I played this week it was god awful you know you get a lot of that stuff there's some pretty cool stuff that comes out too so if you're feeling like damn I need a fix of something new check out the community games you might not see anything that's going to blow you away but you might see something that you know a neat concept for a game that keeps you entertained for a little while which is you know what a game should do and when you consider those those community games are dirt cheap
10495468	10523509	it's something and look past the big franchises Bionic Commando which is coming out in a couple months a month or so looks great Mad World which we talked about a few minutes ago is mind blowing Halo Wars is actually pretty fun you know there's a lot of stuff coming up this year but maybe it's not Devil May Cry 5 maybe it's not Halo 4 just you know let that stuff let that stuff lay for a while you know they're going to rehash it they're going to spit it at us there's going to be a marketing blitz
10524009	10550194	there's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 and 6 and 8 and 10 but here's your chance to branch out try some new games just because they're not beating you down with another AAA title doesn't mean there aren't super high quality games by great developers who still have jobs, knock on wood and we'll be blowing you out of the water and like I said, look to the fourth quarter because there are big names announced especially if you don't have a Sony God of War is going to be blamed a little bit better
10555557	10560469	Deathwishing, we gotta let you go to close out the show but thanks a bunch and thanks for tuning in tonight we appreciate it love you
10563212	10563752	I think so.
10564613	10565373	I love you too.
10565453	10566153	We love you too.
10566654	10566934	Okay.
10566954	10569155	We have last minute stories.
10569615	10569795	Huh?
10570215	10571156	We do have some last minute stories.
10571176	10572816	I do want to make an outbound call real quick.
10572836	10573577	This is an important one.
10573597	10574697	We do want to do one more call.
10574737	10576678	This is outbound because this is important.
10576698	10584741	I want to get this person on the show and unfortunately the way our Skype is set up, we have not been able to get like incoming, we just get bombarded with everybody which we love.
10585081	10590144	We love the fact that so many people are trying to get through but there is somebody we wanted to talk to that couldn't get through and we want to talk to him now.
10590224	10590884	Deke, are you there?
10591889	10592229	Yeah, I'm here.
10592249	10592850	Can you guys hear me?
10592870	10593310	Oh, not bad.
10593370	10593651	Tired.
10593671	10593931	It's 1030 here.
10612547	10637894	so far yeah I've only heard maybe one little thing wrong with it and I'm pretty sure that's got to do with the database move from the old website forums to the new one and so that should be pretty easy to take care of I was honestly thinking in the back of my mind that the site would have to be reset like I was like okay we'll just have to start over with forums you know our news will probably have to start from square one and I was like ready to accept that and then when I looked at the new site today I was like holy crap he got everything migrated from the old site that was pretty impressive so props to you
10638766	10639467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10655410	10656390	Yeah, I'm going to keep track of that.
10683456	10684778	Make sure nobody kind of abuses it.
10684798	10686419	I want to see cocks popping up all over the place.
10686460	10687321	No cock shots!
10688061	10693467	DarkSakura on break took a picture of me eating jelly beans just randomly and uploaded them to the thing.
10693528	10694629	So what should I hold up?
10694689	10695410	Oh, how about cookies?
10695710	10699154	Let's hold up cookies for this and we'll send it right to the website right now.
10700636	10703819	I just posted one of myself posing next to the website a couple of minutes ago.
10704640	10704900	Nice.
10705080	10705500	Very nice.
10705841	10706581	I like it.
10706621	10712343	We're very excited about it and we hope to have it launched maybe next weekend even or something.
10712403	10717885	Just as soon as we get some of our new authors on board because I know Tiara's getting ready to write some game reviews for us.
10717925	10720846	I'm so excited and we're going to have regular content again.
10720886	10722507	I could just tinkle.
10722567	10723307	I'm so excited.
10724988	10725408	Not in here.
10726268	10732791	Well, Deke, thank you so much and please send our thanks along to your family as well who I know have had to put up with you working on the site.
10732931	10733771	We really appreciate it.
10734680	10735000	No worries.
10735040	10735481	Take care, guys.
10764454	10765835	Alright, that's going to do it.
10765895	10767115	We are going to wrap up the show.
10767315	10768776	Sorry to those that didn't get through on Skype.
10768796	10773498	I know a lot of you were getting through, but I also was very happy to hear some new callers get through tonight.
10773518	10775439	That was pretty awesome, so thanks and shout out.
10775499	10779261	Thanks to the guy who ate up all the time because his system was broken because he was using it in the shower.
10779281	10779941	Well done!
10782282	10786844	I think the Justin TV things actually kind of helped us get some new listeners, so I'm really excited to get back on there.
10787425	10793428	I don't think watching a radio show is that exciting, but we'll see what we can do about the TV in the future.
10793508	10795709	Maybe we'll get a Switch box and actually play games.
10795809	10796469	I don't know what we can do.
10796509	10798210	We'll figure something out.
10799171	10803053	I can fix it so the audio, you can hear everything next time.
10803333	10803873	That's easy.
10804113	10810196	Just splitter out your speaker out and then into the... They don't want to hear about the wires.
10810456	10810857	We'll make you
10811857	10812398	DarkSakura.com
10828456	10831217	Like, you know, but anyway, that's for another time.
10831478	10833038	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10833379	10835380	This is going to be a three-hour show this week, but that's all right.
10835720	10838841	I first off want to say, Matt, too, thank you so much for being here.
10838961	10840542	I'm sorry you didn't get to say more tonight.
10840762	10840982	No.
10841002	10842823	But we'll talk more about PC games in a future week.
10842843	10844184	You will come back and join us again, correct?
10844364	10845164	It's Dan's fault, yes.
10845304	10845705	No, yes.
10846325	10847265	No, I had a blast.
10847285	10847866	Thanks for having me.
10848126	10849887	And PC gaming is more my niche, but yeah.
10851248	10853129	Tell us, and we will do more PC gaming in the future.
10853149	10855630	There hasn't been a lot this week, and we've actually got the emails.
10855650	10857211	Why don't you guys talk more about PC gaming?
10857251	10859953	That's why I was like, Matt 2 probably sent one of those emails.
10860453	10862195	It needs to come to the show a little more often.
10864096	10871761	I do want to say, though, for the folks out there who listen, who can't join us in studio, how is it different when you're listening to it on the iPod and when you're here in studio?
10871881	10873802	It's actually a great way to kill, too, to
10874443	10877191	3 hours of my afternoon at work, which is quite spectacular.
10878274	10879818	Quality's good, easy access.
10881002	10882323	How's it different being here live?
10882443	10883163	Oh, being here live?
10884063	10887985	It's colder in the garage because my office is a balmy 72 degrees.
10888765	10889686	It's definitely different.
10889806	10891606	There's definitely a lot of wires around.
10892467	10893107	It's a lot of fun.
10893147	10899850	It's actually, at times I feel like I'm a little behind the times with all the wealth of knowledge that's in here.
10900510	10901250	I feel like the noob.
10901790	10904912	But when we started talking about WoW updates, I felt cool again.
10905812	10909134	So, yeah, Dan's pointing at me, he's about to say something profound.
10909174	10909814	We'll work on you.
10909834	10911815	Because in the world of WoW, you are the king.
10913415	10916917	Sadly, possibly, but no, there are people that out DPS in the tank.
10916937	10917417	In here, anyway.
10917497	10918097	Oh, in here?
10918178	10919538	Okay, cool, I'll take that title.
10919818	10922159	Like, sometimes I hear a term in WoW, and I'm like, I know what that means!
10922740	10923360	DPS!
10923640	10923920	Sweet!
10924060	10928302	No, I had a blast, thanks for having me, and I look forward to next shows where you'll have room for me.
10930422	10932063	Dan, what can I say?
10932143	10934303	Thank you so much for being here and bringing your input.
10934343	10935823	The chatters love you.
10936203	10938184	They want you to be a regular guest on the show.
10938524	10939504	Please come back again, Dan.
10939584	10940264	We had a lot of fun.
10940404	10945585	Even if your wife is a little pissed you keep taking her microphone, maybe we'll get two mics on the couch next time or something.
10945745	10946785	Don't bet on it.
10946825	10951486	I am not pissed.
10951506	10951826	She's fine.
10956843	10959344	You are a butt face, okay?
10959684	10960324	That's great.
10961025	10962905	He told her the mic was off even though it wasn't.
10964666	10966887	DarkSakura, do you have any final thoughts?
10967047	10968087	I had a story.
10968327	10968687	Oh, a story.
10968727	10970208	I didn't even ask for last minute stories.
10970248	10971048	I'm such an asshole.
10971268	10972089	Yes, you are, Bob.
10972109	10973029	Quickly, DarkSakura.
10973829	10977931	There was a guy named Danny Johnson, 14, of Grapevine, Texas.
10978011	10978391	Shut up.
10979691	10985692	who actually set a new world record in Guitar Hero at a Guinness World Records event in Manhattan.
10986772	10993694	He scored 973,954 points playing Dragonforge's Through the Fire and the Flames.
10993794	10998935	And from what I read otherwise, he actually broke a button while doing it.
10999715	11002875	He broke his blue button and he was mad at himself that he didn't hit 100%.
11002955	11003735	He only hit 99%.
11005656	11006996	I'll link the video in the chat room.
11012133	11013415	Loki, did you have any last minute stories?
11013976	11015318	Yeah, just some real quick stuff.
11015538	11018662	Namco's planning on rebooting the Dead to Rights franchise.
11019944	11020926	Dear God, why?
11022631	11023071	I don't know.
11024332	11025213	Interesting, I guess.
11025974	11028916	And then some other stuff.
11028956	11037402	Apparently some dude threatened to blow up the Bomberman devs because he had a problem with his Bomberman game, I guess.
11037982	11044027	It sent them 11 terrorizing emails during a four-month period before the company finally decided to do something.
11045588	11047930	He was unhappy with the quality of Hudson products.
11048190	11049791	He was just getting into the spirit of things.
11049911	11050212	I know.
11050792	11052073	We have one more contribution.
11056745	11061008	Telltale Games is bringing Wallace and Gromit to PC and Xbox Live Arcade this spring.
11061128	11061648	I heard about that.
11061668	11062228	It sounds awesome.
11063749	11069312	And then the last thing, and this is completely retarded, but PlayStation 3 apparently is going to start supporting AmbX.
11071715	11072295	What the hell is that?
11072555	11076936	AmbX is a stupid little thing that you plug into your... It's right now for computers.
11077276	11083177	It has colored lights that change colors depending on the scenes that are in your game.
11083377	11088518	Then there's also fans that blow hot and cold air at you and it vibrates and craps.
11088658	11089098	Think about it.
11089118	11089998	That could be cool.
11090498	11091318	Yes, and craps.
11092059	11092859	And craps!
11093379	11095019	You can say, hey, this sucks shit.
11099140	11099440	Wow.
11100711	11102272	That could be a feature in Excite Trucks 2.
11103533	11104774	Now the truck's crap.
11106616	11107436	I mean, why not?
11107816	11113201	You see those guys that drive down the freeway and they have the balls hanging from their trucks?
11113561	11114121	Why not?
11114842	11115983	Now they can crap too.
11116103	11117844	Don't justify that behavior, Rob.
11118505	11120846	I think that's the most vile thing possible.
11120886	11124329	If you have that on the back of your truck, take it off your truck and choke yourself with it.
11127231	11127872	Seriously.
11128372	11129253	Please die.
11131149	11138333	I have one quick last minute story or I'm going to get the crap kicked out of me by Travis and John over at Under Sedation Live.
11139634	11142356	I believe they're down to like, I want to say like 32 games or 16.
11142876	11143376	How many are they at?
11143396	11143376	2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14.
11143736	11145097	They're down to like the top.
11148899	11149860	Thanks for watching!
11175017	11178278	We got engaged in theory on Valentine's Day.
11205097	11206799	Do you know what I did on Valentine's Day?
11207159	11210102	Sat home and cried and ate Lean Cuisine.
11210142	11211063	That's what I did.
11211543	11212144	No, I'm kidding.
11213245	11220312	But ours was really cool and nerdy because we were watching UHF and eating French bread with spinach dip and drinking Munchweizitz wine.
11221210	11231355	I will say one of the coolest Valentine's Days I had was when the ex and I went to the Star Trek tour at Long Beach.
11231455	11233756	That was a pretty nerdy-tastic Valentine's Day.
11235717	11236517	Some people get married.
11236597	11238598	Some people boldly go where no man has gone before.
11238638	11239098	What can you do?
11239298	11240899	Which kind of are the same thing.
11243700	11244020	All right.
11244601	11245701	Congrats to Travis.
11246441	11246802	Sucker.
11247833	11251816	No, actually, Jenna's the real sucker, actually, in that relationship.
11251956	11252797	No, we love them.
11253137	11254398	Sorry I missed the bachelor party.
11254438	11254839	I was out.
11255719	11264086	But yeah, thanks to all you guys for tuning in and listening to us, whether it be on Justin.TV or on All Games Radio or on the podcast when it gets updated, which, you know, will be sooner than usual.

11267068	11268669	We're going to do it all again next week, right?
11269370	11271652	Well, now everyone knows what my home life is like.
11271812	11272312	Heck yeah.
11272733	11272993	All right.
11273833	11274654	Quickly, final thoughts.
11275074	11276015	I didn't get final thoughts.
11276055	11276936	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11277881	11278722	You know what you're doing.
11279622	11281864	My final thought is Warp Core Breach.
11282004	11282284	Yum.
11282625	11282925	Loki.
11284046	11285507	I need a Cage Match song.
11286287	11286548	All right.
11286748	11287248	That's going to do it.
11287268	11296975	Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting.
