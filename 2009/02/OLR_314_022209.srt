00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:23,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, February 22nd, 2009, a new American McGee's Alice is announced, DSi and Rhythm Heaven get release dates, and will we soon be seeing more Red?

2
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:46,671

4
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:47,732
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:50,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here with you every week as well as the one and only DarkSakura.

6
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:51,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:52,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Hack.

8
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:53,156
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

9
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:53,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Hack.

10
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:55,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Hack, cough, die?

11
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:55,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

12
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Any predictions for tonight's Oscars which we're competing against apparently?

13
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:00,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

14
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:03,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Fart.

15
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fart, the motion picture for best picture.

16
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:12,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who's chowing down on a sandwich over there.

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,320
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

18
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:14,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a sandwich, it's a burger.

19
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:15,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, a burger, sorry.

20
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:17,405
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are making me hungry.

21
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't eaten dinner yet.

22
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:18,587
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

23
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:19,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, good, good.

24
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Any predictions for tonight's Oscars?

25
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:24,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Slumdog Millionaire is going to win.

26
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:46,318
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

27
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:12,035
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was fantabulously uneventful, but hey, I did actually play stuff.

28
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:17,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I played some City of Heroes and more like made a whole bunch of costumes because it was fun.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And I... Actually, Dan and I were watching videos last night comparing the...

30
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:26,065
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, played some more Order of Ecclesia, the Castlevania game.

32
00:02:46,094 --> 00:02:53,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to actually go back and work on my Symphony of the Night game since I've started it and got, like, to one save point and was like, haha, going to bed.

33
00:02:54,678 --> 00:03:01,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, did some thinking about doing tabletop gaming and then went, meh.

34
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:04,223
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's really about it for my gaming week.

35
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:05,843
[SPEAKER_07]: What about you, Loki?

36
00:03:07,344 --> 00:03:08,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Eat the Burger.

37
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:12,869
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, I played a few things this week.

38
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Mainly Lost and Damned.

39
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:22,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to add the other the in there.

40
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: The new Grand Theft Auto expansion is pretty cool.

41
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:26,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's short.

42
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:31,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I kind of like the style of it, more gritty.

43
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things that they've changed are good, some not so good.

44
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:38,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with the multiplayer.

45
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,326
[SPEAKER_02]: For one, the helicopters, they really tweaked.

46
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:46,388
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave the helicopters explosive rounds, and they made them fragile.

47
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:51,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So you run into one little thing and your helicopter's on fire already.

48
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But, because they have explosive rounds, you can blow up a car and people really quick.

49
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:57,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

50
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,259
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of annoying that they had to go and tweak all that.

51
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:13,669
[SPEAKER_02]: They really did the explosive rounds for that Chopper vs. Chopper online mode, which is alright, I guess, but they could have just limited the explosive rounds to that mode instead of fucking everything up.

52
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they did some other stuff that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

53
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:25,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have different preferences where you have to set your preferences on your phone before you can actually go into an online game.

54
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Say, for example, you're hosting one.

55
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:40,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Your preferences for auto-aim, for the cops, and for, well, if you're doing free mode, friendly fire on or off are locked into whatever your preferences are.

56
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:44,283
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't change it on there, which is really retarded.

57
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:55,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why they did it for, you know, if you're searching for a game, but as far as hosting the game, you should be able to change those options without having to back out of everything and it's really retarded and caught us off guard with that kind of stuff.

58
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And for free mode, they took out the helicopters.

59
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:01,513
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no fucking helicopters for no reason whatsoever.

60
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:03,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes no sense at all.

61
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why they did that.

62
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,099
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it's pretty fun.

63
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:39,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, what we normally do at lunch, me and my friend, we just kind of shoot each other with the helicopters anyway, so we just play a deathmatch just at free mode, and big deal, it's the same thing.

64
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,065
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's fine.

65
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the game itself is pretty fun, and we'll be getting into a little bit more of it.

66
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:54,691
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some stuff they did for Controversy that I don't get it, and it's stupid, but whatever.

67
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:55,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

68
00:05:56,786 --> 00:05:57,427
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

69
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:21,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I had store credit, so no actual money was being spent.

70
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:31,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, other than that, I also played Nobi Nobi Boy, or like I'd refer it to Baby's First Tapeworm.

71
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:37,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this game, I haven't really figured out, I mean, obviously the point is to stretch as far as possible.

72
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:40,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you do that if you eat things.

73
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:46,610
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I found, eating things didn't really seem to do anything, but hey, maybe it does, and I just don't notice it.

74
00:06:47,290 --> 00:07:00,334
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, basically you're this kind of weird tube-like creature that looks like it could have been straight out of, you know, um, I don't know, just, um, of course the Katamari universe.

75
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:04,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything that's pretty much in this looks like it's straight out of the Katamari universe.

76
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:05,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

77
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:08,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's a weird game.

78
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:13,278
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of get bored with it after a while, but I've been trying to stretch my character out.

79
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:23,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten to the point where I'm so long that I actually, if I stretch out up or down, it'll go so far that it thinks I've fallen to my death, which, you know, you can't really die in the game.

80
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:25,642
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of pop back out of your chimney.

81
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:30,244
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can eat things, and then you'll poop them out.

82
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:34,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, because stuff will explode out of your ass.

83
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:36,743
[SPEAKER_05]: The auto shotgun's pretty sweet.

84
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:04,564
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they took out helicopters out of free mode.

85
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:05,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Only free mode, though.

86
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't make any sense.

87
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:07,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

88
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:09,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Comment from Tigerclaw.

89
00:08:09,385 --> 00:08:10,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Noby Noby Boy is like Snake.

90
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,246
[SPEAKER_05]: You get bigger as you eat stuff.

91
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:14,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if that's the case.

92
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:15,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You just stretch.

93
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,868
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, like, kind of... Wouldn't stretch imply getting big?

94
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you stretch by getting bigger, but it's not necessarily eating things.

95
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically stretch out.

96
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's eating things that does anything.

97
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the eating things part does.

98
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,141
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

99
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:49,208
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

100
00:09:09,056 --> 00:09:10,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Please explain!

101
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:15,878
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a guy standing there and you have to take a shit and you have to not shit your pants.

102
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a text adventure game.

103
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,199
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically you type in what you need him to do.

104
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,541
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to tell him to take off your pants, pull door to bathroom.

105
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:27,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you find this game?

106
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:30,542
[SPEAKER_07]: You have him take off his pants before he opens the door to the bathroom.

107
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:33,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played this too?

108
00:09:33,587 --> 00:09:33,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

109
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:37,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it in any order, but yes, that's what you have to do.

110
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:41,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Take out pants, take off pants, pee, go in the bathroom.

111
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:45,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can like, you know, you can shit on the ground.

112
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:50,618
[SPEAKER_02]: The basic object of the game is not to shit your pants, but you can shit on the ground, shit in the toilet.

113
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,080
[SPEAKER_02]: They have ten different achievements for different things you can do.

114
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

115
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:58,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

116
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,901
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's pretty much my gaming week.

117
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:06,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

118
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:17,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what is it though with... Did you find this game, because I noticed kind of a theme on PlayStation Network recently that a lot of their big games don't give you much explanation on what the hell to do with them.

119
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:21,129
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't know what the hell I was supposed to do with them.

120
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,431
[SPEAKER_02]: It says there's no objective whatsoever, but...

121
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:32,732
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the girl stretching out into space, but you don't see how close she is to another planet or something like that.

122
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:36,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she's just really fucking far out there.

123
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:38,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Has she hit the moon yet?

124
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:42,558
[SPEAKER_02]: She's probably gone beyond the moon, but the only planet you can play is Earth.

125
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:48,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can kind of generate new maps and stuff, but they're all kind of the same.

126
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't really get it, what I was supposed to be doing.

127
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:54,185
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was supposed to be eating stuff or, you know...

128
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,550
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

129
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:17,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll play it during the break.

130
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:18,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright, I'll have to check it out.

131
00:11:19,724 --> 00:11:27,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I also played a pretty big release on the PlayStation Network this week that also gives you very little explanation on what the hell you're supposed to do.

132
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:27,807
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Flower.

133
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:32,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Flower, I'd honestly best describe it, honestly, it's a racing game, in my opinion.

134
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:36,989
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very, very different type of racing game, but it's kind of a racing game.

135
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:41,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe that's not the fairest way to describe it, but you certainly have an acceleration button...

136
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,232
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

137
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:08,169
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

138
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:29,197
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

139
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:54,265
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

140
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,260
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

141
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:31,855
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

142
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe three, I don't know.

143
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:59,947
[SPEAKER_05]: The game does leave some elements to be explored, such as there are secret petals that you can find in stages.

144
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,808
[SPEAKER_05]: There are secret areas to go in in different stages.

145
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:04,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the game is very open.

146
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:08,591
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't give you a lot of description as to what you're supposed to do in the game, so there is a lot of exploration.

147
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:09,451
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very big element.

148
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:18,896
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really a seventh stage, too, that's the credits, which plays slightly differently, in which when you're exploding the flowers, basically, you're also collecting the letters of the staff in the game.

149
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:21,038
[SPEAKER_05]: All in all, I think it's a pretty good game.

150
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:43,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Title for download and $10 is a fair price considering it's just the sheer beauty of the game and I think it's something that's very easy to pick up.

151
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:46,380
[SPEAKER_05]: You use the X button and you use 6 axis to play the game.

152
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:46,820
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

153
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,003
[SPEAKER_05]: You tilt the 6 axis to move which doesn't play as bad as you might think and you use the X to accelerate.

154
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:52,383
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

155
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:54,004
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically the controls.

156
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:57,125
[SPEAKER_02]: as the controls for Flow.

157
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:58,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was their other game.

158
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:59,706
[SPEAKER_05]: The same developers who made Flow.

159
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,267
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a Flow reference in the game.

160
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:03,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the trophies you collect is Flow.

161
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:05,048
[SPEAKER_05]: A Flow trophy or whatever.

162
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I enjoyed Flower.

163
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say pick it up.

164
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see that they're probably going to expand this game later on maybe with some extra stages and things.

165
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:14,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be okay.

166
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think they need to put a demo out for it.

167
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:18,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

168
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,404
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

169
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:57,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

170
00:16:12,742 --> 00:16:18,864
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is difficult, especially with some of those characters that really rely on rolling motions for their moves.

171
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:33,951
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

172
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:56,551
[SPEAKER_05]: and Arcade Joystick if I'm really going to want to be able to be any good at this game, especially online.

173
00:16:56,852 --> 00:17:04,381
[SPEAKER_05]: When I play characters like Chun-Li, I don't have a problem at all, because most of Chun-Li's moves are back and forth, or up to down, or back to forth.

174
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:08,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's, you know...

175
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,564
[SPEAKER_05]: That's easy on the Xbox 360 stick.

176
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:17,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm looking at chat room, chat.orangelaundry.com, and Gunstar in chat says, get an arcade stick, Rob.

177
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm thinking... Hey!

178
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:20,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that your husband?

179
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:21,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

180
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:22,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Might be.

181
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's the name he'd use.

182
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,699
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I might need to invest the money to get it.

183
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the question.

184
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I love Street Fighter IV that much?

185
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:46,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, granted, I could get use out of this on other fighting games I play, like Soul Calibur 4 is pretty awesome, and I'm sure they'll be, like, maybe I'll enjoy Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo Super Edition High Def a little more if I actually got an arcade stick.

186
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I don't know.

187
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,630
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of money to drop on a controller.

188
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,451
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just worried I won't be playing this game that long.

189
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:59,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Some very obvious modes I think were left out of the game, which is a disappointment.

190
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:06,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of cool that you can turn on the mode where you, like, seek other players while you're playing arcade mode, basically.

191
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:13,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might, like, it gives that old, very old-fashioned feel of somebody walking up to the arcade game and just dropping a quarter in and challenging you.

192
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:14,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

193
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:36,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Being able to set that to friends only is something I would really think would be an obvious mode they did not choose to enable.

194
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:41,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I would love to play with that mode on if only my friends could challenge me.

195
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:44,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, and you might be thinking, well, why do you want to set it that way, Rob?

196
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:44,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I...

197
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:52,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Like to play with friends on Xbox Live more than I do random a-holes that sometimes, you know, I don't really want to play with.

198
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:54,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tiger Glass says I have it turned off.

199
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I do most of the time, too.

200
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I spend most of my time with it turned off as well.

201
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But it would be cool.

202
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd probably leave it on more often if friends could just walk up and challenge me.

203
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:06,599
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

204
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:25,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

205
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of money to pay.

206
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:47,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And this whole accessibility.

207
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:50,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the game is accessible if you've played Street Fighter 2 before.

208
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:56,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been taking a little bit of crap for not being as accessible as they say it is in regards to the difficulty.

209
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not going to lie to you.

210
00:19:58,051 --> 00:19:59,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Seth is a cheap bitch.

211
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,734
[SPEAKER_05]: He sucks, even on easiest mode.

212
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:02,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucks a lot.

213
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:07,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the opponents start to really suck too when you get up there.

214
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in medium and some of those other modes.

215
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,322
[SPEAKER_05]: However, what I loved about it

216
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 3, Street Fighter Alpha, Capcom SNK

217
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:50,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Marvel, Capcom you know all those games kind of came out in that Dreamcast era that I kind of didn't play a lot of games through and so for me I didn't play a lot of those games I was able to pick up Street Fighter 4 no problem no problem because the moves are pretty much the same so

218
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:54,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had a good time with the game.

219
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:59,537
[SPEAKER_05]: $60 though, that's a lot to ask for somebody that's based on nostalgia only.

220
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:05,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I would honestly recommend you play it at a friend's house first before you drop that kind of money.

221
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:13,839
[SPEAKER_05]: If you envision that this is a game you would play online a lot, if you are a fighting game fan at all, then definitely Street Fighter IV needs to be in your collection.

222
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,060
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're a casual fighting game fan like me...

223
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,381
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

224
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,052
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have to admit that Gil's a bastard.

225
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:53,433
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all bastards.

226
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's going to do it for my gaming week.

227
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:56,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go on forever.

228
00:21:56,835 --> 00:21:58,016
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some news we want to get to tonight.

229
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:01,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to some housekeeping.

230
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:02,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And there isn't a lot right now.

231
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:08,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to point out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, very cool new feature where our podcasts, when we get them to the feed...

232
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,023
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

233
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:32,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

234
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,901
[SPEAKER_05]: They said Justin TV was down.

235
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:34,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it came back up.

236
00:22:35,142 --> 00:22:35,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

237
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:39,264
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, remember folks, Justin TV is priority number two.

238
00:22:39,384 --> 00:22:40,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we are a radio show.

239
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:41,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Disconnected again.

240
00:22:41,966 --> 00:22:42,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird.

241
00:22:42,646 --> 00:22:44,467
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a radio show, not a TV show.

242
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:46,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So Justin TV is not priority number one.

243
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is going to go down occasionally.

244
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just sucks.

245
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:52,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure you always tune in at allgames.com.

246
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, also our LiveJournal community.

247
00:22:57,696 --> 00:23:00,258
[SPEAKER_05]: All the communities are right there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

248
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:06,782
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to find other Orange Lounge Radio listeners, very cool community, just nice people.

249
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:08,223
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't like jerks in our community.

250
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:14,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you want to find us, look at the little box that says Extended Play on OrangeLoungeRadio.com in the bottom left-hand corner.

251
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:14,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

252
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:21,492
[SPEAKER_05]: It directly links you to Facebook, Last.fm, MySpace, YouTube, even though we haven't updated YouTube in forever.

253
00:23:21,852 --> 00:23:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: OLRPSP.com, it's awesome so check that out I have to ask something and I'm going to actually put this up on our gallery is that your printer?

254
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,253
[SPEAKER_05]: That one on the floor, yes.

255
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:34,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Your printer looks like an ice chest.

256
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, doesn't it?

257
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:40,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm putting this up on... Go to our gallery, because we've been putting pictures up on it.

258
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been taking tons of pictures.

259
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:45,276
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm taking a picture of the messy floor.

260
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:46,916
[SPEAKER_05]: And other people can submit pictures, too.

261
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:52,937
[SPEAKER_05]: But I swear to God, the first time somebody submits a picture that is inappropriate, we're pulling the plug on that thing.

262
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:53,557
[SPEAKER_07]: No boobs.

263
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:54,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no boobs.

264
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:55,718
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have a special...

265
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I'm okay with boobs as long as they're covered boobs.

266
00:23:59,842 --> 00:24:02,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have young kids that look at the website.

267
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:06,970
[SPEAKER_05]: But dead or alive boobs are fine.

268
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:11,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news, shall we, Loki?

269
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:11,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

270
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:20,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was, of course, the release this week of Lost in Damned, and with it was a little bit of controversy.

271
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:25,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off, the bit that I don't really get why it was in there, but it was.

272
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:31,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently there was full frontal male nudity in Lost in Damned.

273
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:42,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one of the characters that you talked to, Mr. Stubbs, is in a... I'm sorry, that's just funny right there, that the character's name is Stubby.

274
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Stubbs, yes, he's actually... Is Stubby Chubby?

275
00:24:46,582 --> 00:24:47,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not seen the scene.

276
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:53,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Contrary to what you all might think, I have not went and looked at the scene because I think the whole thing is a little silly.

277
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,288
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just whatever, you know, it's full frontal, whatever.

278
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:04,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, he's there, you know, completely naked because he's in a bathhouse, and...

279
00:25:05,615 --> 00:25:06,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's all hanging out.

280
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone's like, oh my god, why'd they do that?

281
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:10,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

282
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:12,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, why did they do that?

283
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:13,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Because here's my thing.

284
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:18,239
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can put full frontal male nudity in this, why aren't the strippers topless?

285
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,759
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

286
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because that's the lesser of two evils right there.

287
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get why that's the case, but whatever.

288
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:27,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's in the game.

289
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:28,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really minor.

290
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:30,923
[SPEAKER_02]: No big deal, but just in case.

291
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:32,903
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

292
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:42,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other stuff that was interesting, there was some censorship tweaks on the European and Australian versions of the game.

293
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:51,357
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, the European versions, apparently their versions of Grand Theft Auto 4 have been censored with the update.

294
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:54,099
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, of course, by accident.

295
00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,063
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Rockstar is working on it right now so that it will be

296
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:04,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

297
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:22,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, the censorship that's going on, there's no blood pools.

298
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:34,491
[SPEAKER_02]: The camera, when you get, you know, services from a prostitute, you can normally move the camera around to get better angles and stuff, but in censored versions, it's not.

299
00:26:36,371 --> 00:26:44,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But, apparently, yeah, the Lost and Damned actually reverted the censorship on the Australian version, so that's kind of interesting.

300
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:48,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, it's a cock.

301
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:51,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, they're just trying to ruffle some feathers with this, and they've succeeded.

302
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:53,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, whatever.

303
00:26:53,518 --> 00:26:57,119
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I like, though, that at least it's not, like, sexualized.

304
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:01,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It's there to accomplish one thing.

305
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:03,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's there to get people talking.

306
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:10,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, mission accomplished, because here we are in our little crappy podcast talking about your full frontal male nudity in a game that, you know, is completely random.

307
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:12,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Just say it.

308
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:13,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Cock!

309
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:14,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, it's just a cock.

310
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,549
[SPEAKER_05]: It shouldn't be that big of a deal.

311
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:23,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I would not suddenly want there to be random cocks in all my games.

312
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:24,556
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

313
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly it's, oh my god, a cock monster in Final Fantasy.

314
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:31,883
[SPEAKER_07]: We need more penis in video games.

315
00:27:31,923 --> 00:27:34,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But to be fair, if we're going to have more penis, then we need more vag.

316
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't talk right now Hi We have Danny

317
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:05,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Camara?

318
00:28:06,678 --> 00:28:06,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

319
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:13,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob has salvaged my laptop because I'm actually trying not to move my laptop, so that was me last week.

320
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:14,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Joe say hi?

321
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:15,782
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't.

322
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

323
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,906
[SPEAKER_07]: But they know you better as DarkTetsuya.

324
00:28:23,626 --> 00:28:24,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, awesome.

325
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, DarkTetsuya, and friends, everybody's here tonight.

326
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,630
[SPEAKER_07]: If my laptop catches on fire, it's Rob's fault.

327
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well it's not my fault, you spilled something on it.

328
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:36,877
[SPEAKER_07]: You startled me, Rob, with your Rob-ness.

329
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:40,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my fault if you got excited.

330
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Now my laptop smells like Propel.

331
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:46,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not my fault if you got excited at us talking about the story about Cox and Vag, okay?

332
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,887
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need more games like this.

333
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:50,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

334
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:51,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

335
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:54,951
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're going to have this game with ultra-violence, then why not ultra-nudity?

336
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have Pacey's.

337
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

338
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,674
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit more flesh.

339
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

340
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:07,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're going to show cock and balls, they can seriously just put boobies in there.

341
00:29:07,242 --> 00:29:08,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't get it.

342
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:13,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree they should be fair and have some boobs in it too, but you know, whatever.

343
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:14,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

344
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't even care.

345
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:18,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why people care so damn much.

346
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:23,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I understand it's because we've never really seen this in a game before, OMG.

347
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:24,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone's got to do it.

348
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:25,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

349
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,108
[SPEAKER_07]: May as well be them.

350
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,057
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

351
00:29:45,572 --> 00:29:47,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 4 Street Fighter 2

352
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:10,911
[SPEAKER_05]: T-Hawk was awesome.

353
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:11,651
[SPEAKER_05]: T-Hawk was awesome.

354
00:30:11,691 --> 00:30:12,211
[SPEAKER_05]: T-Hawk was awesome.

355
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:44,541
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Gunstar agrees with me in chat, because DJ and T-Hawk suck.

356
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:50,285
[SPEAKER_05]: However, all hope may not be lost for DJ and T-Hawk fans.

357
00:30:50,826 --> 00:30:57,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yoshinori Ono, who is the producer of Street Fighter IV, has kind of teased the idea of these guys appearing later on.

358
00:30:57,952 --> 00:30:59,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was in Famitsu Magazine.

359
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:02,755
[SPEAKER_05]: He actually said that some 3D models were created.

360
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:03,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see pictures of that.

361
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:04,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet that would be pretty cool.

362
00:31:05,518 --> 00:31:09,681
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually went so far as to actually plan out the combat style for T-Hawk...

363
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:13,045
[SPEAKER_05]: But they got cut before the game actually came out.

364
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:18,573
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Ono did say if the fans want it bad enough, the characters could be added at a later date.

365
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:19,795
[SPEAKER_05]: How would that happen?

366
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Could that be download content?

367
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:23,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Could that be a re-release of the game?

368
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:25,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's more likely.

369
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:27,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually see download content.

370
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:32,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a gold edition later like how they did with Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

371
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:34,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but here's the thing with download content.

372
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:43,889
[SPEAKER_05]: If they didn't already plan for these two guys to be download content, what happens if one of my friends downloads it and has T-Hawk and then fights me online?

373
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:45,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have T-Hawk.

374
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,730
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens?

375
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, yeah, Drew, you have a thought?

376
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:54,567
[SPEAKER_12]: or have a light pack downloaded where you have the characters there you just can't select them

377
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:27,583
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, kind of like you could get to... What was it they did for Fable 2 where you could go to that area but you didn't have all the stuff that went with it?

378
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:33,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say something a little controversial about Street Fighter 4?

379
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I'm going to get shit for this.

380
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,911
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs more cock?

381
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:37,272
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

382
00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:38,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's honestly something I noticed.

383
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:43,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially talking about DJ getting cut from the game and all this stuff.

384
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are the black people in Street Fighter 4?

385
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:48,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

386
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:49,263
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an honest question.

387
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:50,004
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Balrog.

388
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:50,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Balrog, that's it.

389
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:53,046
[SPEAKER_07]: One out of... He was for the longest time too.

390
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:53,387
[SPEAKER_05]: How many?

391
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:55,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Most everybody in the game is Asian, Rob.

392
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:59,652
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like white people beating each other up the game, is what it is.

393
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:01,934
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Asian people beating up the white guys the game.

394
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:14,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's, like, you know, well, I guess you have one Indian guy, too, and, you know, I don't know, it just seemed like these guys, you know, DJ and T-Hawk, T-Hawk especially was a little more ethnic, like, not a type you see in, like, other games, right?

395
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's like, um...

396
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:20,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

397
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:23,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize it's a little bit, it's a small world-ish, but what?

398
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:27,330
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Japanese anime-ish fighting game.

399
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you really expect that much racial diversity?

400
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:31,112
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

401
00:33:31,352 --> 00:33:33,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen, there was Def Jam.

402
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,233
[SPEAKER_12]: The game's a little white.

403
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:35,714
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I'm saying.

404
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:37,434
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the game's a lot Asian.

405
00:33:41,216 --> 00:33:44,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, okay, you have 50 Cent Blood in the Sand coming out this week.

406
00:33:44,797 --> 00:33:46,438
[SPEAKER_02]: It evens itself out, okay?

407
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It's A-Z-N for reals, yo.

408
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:53,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat room, am I wrong?

409
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:56,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I a bad person for thinking this?

410
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:59,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell him he's wrong and he's a bad person for thinking it.

411
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Biohaze says black people are non-existent in the Street Fighter universe.

412
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:02,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not true.

413
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:04,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Balrog is... Yeah, since the beginning.

414
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Gunstar says Sagat is kind of like a brother and he kicks ass.

415
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:09,343
[SPEAKER_07]: He's Thai.

416
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,431
[SPEAKER_05]: and GameGuru says DJ was created by Capcom USA.

417
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:14,351
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

418
00:34:14,411 --> 00:34:15,351
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something I didn't think of.

419
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:16,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when they did Super Street Fighter?

420
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:18,412
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the character the USA made.

421
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:20,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Good observation, GameGuru.

422
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:25,133
[SPEAKER_05]: UnfoldedRaptor wants to point out there are green people.

423
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:28,494
[SPEAKER_05]: BioHaze says no more Mexicans.

424
00:34:28,554 --> 00:34:31,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we have someone from Central or South America for once?

425
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:34,255
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Blanca.

426
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:36,075
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a pity.

427
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:38,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

428
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:40,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Jimmy!

429
00:34:42,464 --> 00:34:43,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Rolling and rolling.

430
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:48,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Go look at Dan's ending for Street Fighter 3, you'll know what I'm talking about.

431
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:58,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, and then I could also say, you don't really have a gay fighter either, but then people would say Vega, but Vega's not gay, he's just an asshole.

432
00:34:58,175 --> 00:34:59,476
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think he's very gay.

433
00:34:59,856 --> 00:35:05,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing, he's not gay, he's just queer.

434
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,441
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference.

435
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:16,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Vega, actually I think Vega, well, off camera, really is a major, major crossdresser.

436
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,470
[SPEAKER_07]: A drag queen.

437
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:18,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

438
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:23,053
[SPEAKER_07]: With all that attention to his face, drag queen.

439
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:26,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Those shoes, look at the heels on those shoes.

440
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:27,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Drag queen.

441
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:29,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says he's just metrosexual.

442
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:30,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Drag queen.

443
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,270
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

444
00:35:53,125 --> 00:36:02,472
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that it will not be out for a while, but it's going to be out for PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.

445
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:12,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically saying that EA is behind it along with American McGee and we should be getting it out.

446
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,160
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yay.

447
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:16,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said it's going to be darker.

448
00:36:16,703 --> 00:36:18,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the picture that they... More darker.

449
00:36:18,364 --> 00:36:19,125
[SPEAKER_02]: More darker.

450
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,614
[SPEAKER_02]: The pictures they were teasing it with were like a bunch of snails trying to attack.

451
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:25,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the racing snail.

452
00:36:26,055 --> 00:36:31,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think this could be because... I don't know if you guys know, but there's a new Alice in Wonderland movie coming out next year.

453
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:32,942
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being done by Tim Burton.

454
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:34,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter.

455
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:38,367
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy from Little Britain is Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

456
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:40,409
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some pretty interesting casting.

457
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: The big guy from Little Britain is Tweedledee.

458
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim Burton Movies

459
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:09,320
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very few Tim Burton movies I don't... There's a man, though, who has gotten too full of himself and too stuck on his style.

460
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't... Okay, I don't listen to him in interviews.

461
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, I don't know the person.

462
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:13,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know his movies.

463
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:15,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I like the movies.

464
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,142
[SPEAKER_08]: At least he's not George Lucas.

465
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:20,863
[SPEAKER_05]: At least there's always that.

466
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:30,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to chatroom, chat.orangeloungeradio.com VXJasonXV says, I like how Dark Sakura is personifying a made-up character.

467
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:32,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Hence Vega.

468
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,752
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S asks, okay, Sky, would you date Vega?

469
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:42,394
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I have dated guys that were that self-centered, just so you know.

470
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:45,035
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, I would not date Vega, based on previous experience.

471
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:46,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

472
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:49,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And the City Vampire simply says, Tim Burton needs a haircut.

473
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:50,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

474
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:52,267
[SPEAKER_05]: That I would agree with.

475
00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:53,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, more gaming news, Loki.

476
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:54,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

477
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: First, a bit of random stuff while you guys were talking.

478
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:02,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to figure out exactly what you have to do in Nobi Nobi Boy.

479
00:38:03,997 --> 00:38:05,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Which apparently is eat things.

480
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:12,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing I found out is that you can eat a human and an animal or a human and a fruit or something like that.

481
00:38:12,844 --> 00:38:16,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will create hybrid creatures when it poops it out.

482
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:20,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want... You can actually create ManBearPig?

483
00:38:21,815 --> 00:38:22,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

484
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:23,456
[SPEAKER_02]: In your anus?

485
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: In your anus.

486
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:25,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

487
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:26,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

488
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:30,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, something not quite as exciting as anus ManBearPig.

489
00:38:32,222 --> 00:38:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: EA has announced a port of Dead Space for the Wii.

490
00:38:36,645 --> 00:38:38,267
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually Dead Space Extraction.

491
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:43,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be an on-rails shooter because obviously the Wii can't really hold up the...

492
00:38:44,751 --> 00:39:07,966
[SPEAKER_02]: graphic detail of the 360 and PS3 versions but it will be kind of I guess a little bit like I guess Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles but you know with Dead Space stuff so new weapons new enemies puzzles co-op multiplayer sounds kind of cool

493
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:13,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I like light gun shooter games on, uh, you know, I still haven't played the House of the Dead one that just came out.

494
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,840
[SPEAKER_02]: That looked interesting, though.

495
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:17,142
[SPEAKER_05]: That one didn't just come out, did it?

496
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:18,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, it was a little while ago, wasn't it?

497
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, House of the Dead Overkill, that came out a couple weeks ago.

498
00:39:21,384 --> 00:39:22,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I didn't realize it was so recent.

499
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:23,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there another?

500
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:25,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, it was like a compilation of prior games.

501
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right.

502
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,108
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a year ago.

503
00:39:28,388 --> 00:39:29,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it a little mixed up.

504
00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:34,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, alright, well, you're a fan of rail shooters, DarkSakura.

505
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:35,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something you might get?

506
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:36,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

507
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:37,033
Eh.

508
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:38,373
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

509
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:48,688
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty.

510
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:53,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hey, moving on to a completely different type of game, Leisure Suit Larry.

511
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:56,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the old Sierra series, Leisure Suit Larry?

512
00:39:56,393 --> 00:40:00,856
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to talk about the original boobs in video games, you got to go all the way back to Leisure Suit Larry.

513
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:07,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they tried to bring the series back a couple years ago with a game that was kind of, eh, it was like a lukewarm reception game.

514
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:12,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we kind of thought, oh, this series is probably gone and best remembered in our memory.

515
00:40:12,664 --> 00:40:13,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

516
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Leisure Suit Larry, Box Office Bust...

517
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:24,459
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a game that was kind of cut to the side after Activision and Blizzard merged.

518
00:40:24,759 --> 00:40:27,924
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember people were talking about Ghostbusters and Brutal Legends, some of these games.

519
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of people were talking about Leisure Suit Larry.

520
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:31,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um...

521
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:57,963
[SPEAKER_05]: apparently Codemasters has actually jumped in it's one of their other branches Funsta which is a casual game branch of the company so that's a little interesting in my opinion but they have picked up the publishing rights to the game and the game is going to come out in April it's going to be on the PC, Playstation 3 and 360 and yes it's been rated mature by the ESRB no word if there's cocks um

522
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:00,237
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

523
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:18,687
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably be... Let me see.

524
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:25,750
[SPEAKER_02]: The last game that came out, the casual games that they had in there, they had... I don't know if they had streaking in there.

525
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:30,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember there was quarters, and they had this little... It was fun.

526
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:37,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little minigame that you had to... You were a little sperm, and you had to dodge... That was the minigame I played at E3 a couple years ago.

527
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:39,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you had to dodge something.

528
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:40,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what it was.

529
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:40,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff.

530
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:47,483
[SPEAKER_02]: During the conversation, depending on how well you did, your conversation would be smoother or whatever.

531
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:49,885
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd talk her out of her clothes.

532
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:54,649
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you hit stuff, you'd fart or make stupid comments and stuff like that.

533
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:55,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty funny.

534
00:41:56,531 --> 00:41:56,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

535
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:58,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of liked the last game.

536
00:41:58,773 --> 00:42:02,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this one, I don't know.

537
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll check it out, but who knows.

538
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll see.

539
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,564
[SPEAKER_05]: More information, I guess, on this to come.

540
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:11,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably a little closer to the release date in April.

541
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:23,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, other stuff that's happening near April is a particular game that was very, very popular on Xbox Live Arcade coming to PC on March 31st, and that would be Braid.

542
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:28,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's getting a price markup to $20.

543
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:30,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Think it's worth it?

544
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:31,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it...

545
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:33,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

546
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,966
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you hadn't played the game, right?

547
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:02,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

548
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:04,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think you might check it out on PC?

549
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:05,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

550
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

551
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:07,570
[SPEAKER_05]: It was worth asking.

552
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:07,630
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

553
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:10,132
[SPEAKER_05]: When do I have time?

554
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:12,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And the chatroom is confirming for me that Braid was 15.

555
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:14,575
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it came out a long time ago.

556
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:14,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was 10.

557
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:16,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So sue me.

558
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:20,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft begs to differ in our chatroom.

559
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:22,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.ArmstrongsRadio.com says Braid isn't really worth it.

560
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

561
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:27,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very different type of puzzle game.

562
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:28,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario is a puzzle game.

563
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,397
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very entertaining to me.

564
00:43:31,637 --> 00:43:32,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It was alright.

565
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it a lot.

566
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I agree with Acidic Vampire.

567
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:38,152
[SPEAKER_05]: The soundtrack is beautiful.

568
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'll stop interrupting.

569
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:48,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the 360, there is more confirmation of a rumored Red Xbox 360 system coming soon.

570
00:43:48,637 --> 00:43:57,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the Red Xbox 360 Elite system was mentioned in a Microsoft press release from New Zealand.

571
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:04,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was saying that there was some sort of deal going on where you buy a 360 and get a free copy of

572
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:13,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo Wars, and that the red Xbox 360 Elite console, which is exclusive to EB Games.

573
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:15,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it's exclusive to EB Games there.

574
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:18,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

575
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:21,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a red system coming out.

576
00:44:21,152 --> 00:44:23,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's going to come out with Resident Evil.

577
00:44:25,353 --> 00:44:26,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe soon.

578
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:29,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they're doing red so that you don't notice the rings.

579
00:44:29,972 --> 00:44:33,013
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the joke I think that has to be made there.

580
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,474
[SPEAKER_05]: The rings blend in with it.

581
00:44:35,114 --> 00:44:38,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Red seems like a really weird color for a video game system, though.

582
00:44:38,195 --> 00:44:38,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just me?

583
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:42,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I get black, I get white, I get gray.

584
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:44,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I even get pink for the DS.

585
00:44:44,658 --> 00:44:45,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually understand that.

586
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:46,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But red?

587
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked for the Virtual Boy.

588
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

589
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:49,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, it didn't.

590
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:54,402
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw nothing but red on the Virtual Boy.

591
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:54,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

592
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:56,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

593
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:01,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could see them putting something like this out for a limited time or something.

594
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:03,730
[SPEAKER_02]: People might buy it.

595
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:07,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the Xbox being green, that made sense, actually.

596
00:45:07,894 --> 00:45:12,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the Xbox that was green, the Halo one, not the regular black one.

597
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:13,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I don't know.

598
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Red seems like a strange color, though.

599
00:45:15,822 --> 00:45:16,343
[SPEAKER_05]: But okay.

600
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:17,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, whatever.

601
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm just saying that because I know it would totally clash in my house.

602
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:32,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if this were to actually exist, that they're going to be probably making an announcement very soon on it, since Resident Evil comes out in a few weeks.

603
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:39,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just assuming that it's actually going to be coming out with Resident Evil, not that I would know or anything, but I'm just saying, it's got to be soon.

604
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:48,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically, I mean, that something like this would be coming out with Resident Evil, we'd have to know about it very soon, since that's only a few weeks away.

605
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:50,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypothetically speaking.

606
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:52,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, evening in Japan?

607
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:07,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Rising 2

608
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:39,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because we've kind of had the hype for it the past week and it's been confirmed.

609
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really that big of a secret?

610
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:43,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do we really think something new is going to come out of this?

611
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I read this, I was like, it's just going to be Dead Rising 2.

612
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:48,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it could be something lame like Sheep.

613
00:46:51,086 --> 00:46:52,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Capcom making the Sheep game?

614
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:54,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're publishing it.

615
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,851
[SPEAKER_10]: They should do Black Sheep, the game.

616
00:46:57,472 --> 00:46:59,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Captain Commando HD Remix.

617
00:46:59,594 --> 00:47:02,277
[SPEAKER_05]: They are 17 hours ahead, so they are about noon.

618
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:03,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about noon in Japan right now.

619
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:05,501
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see more in a little while.

620
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:09,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I, for one, support the Captain Commando HD Remix.

621
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:10,186
[SPEAKER_05]: You think?

622
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:14,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I dumped so many quarters in that game, it's not even funny.

623
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:16,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Mega Man 10.

624
00:47:17,312 --> 00:47:18,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I somehow doubt it.

625
00:47:18,152 --> 00:47:18,912
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Area 50?

626
00:47:18,952 --> 00:47:19,453
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that game?

627
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:20,073
[SPEAKER_02]: UN Squadron on Xbox Live.

628
00:47:20,093 --> 00:47:20,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

629
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:20,953
[SPEAKER_02]: UN Squadron.

630
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:40,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to interject.

631
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:43,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten the best reaction out of Drew ever.

632
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:43,542
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

633
00:47:44,023 --> 00:47:53,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I've shown him a copy of the Amazon page for the book I'm going to be ordering, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the classic Regency romance now with ultra-violent zombie mayhem.

634
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:56,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That would kind of tie into the whole Dead Rising thing.

635
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:57,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

636
00:47:57,754 --> 00:47:58,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know.

637
00:47:58,254 --> 00:47:58,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish.

638
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Dream on, I hate to say it.

639
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:08,292
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

640
00:48:08,692 --> 00:48:11,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel the world and look at some release dates that we actually know about.

641
00:48:11,393 --> 00:48:14,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Or another Monster Hunter game, because they like making Monster Hunter.

642
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:19,415
[SPEAKER_05]: That would make sense for Japan, too.

643
00:48:19,435 --> 00:48:22,075
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't advertise that the trailer was going to be here, right?

644
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:23,816
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

645
00:48:24,096 --> 00:48:26,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel the world and look at some of the release dates that we know about.

646
00:48:26,497 --> 00:48:27,977
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off in Europe, DarkSakura.

647
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:33,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, coming out for the gaming systems and PCs and stuff in Europe.

648
00:48:34,054 --> 00:48:53,910
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 27th, we have Castlevania Judgment on Wii, Cryostasis for PC, Dead Rising Chop Till You Drop on Wii, Family Ski and Snowboard on Wii, Halo Wars for Xbox 360, Killzone 2 for PlayStation 3, Men of War on PC, Necrovision on PC, um...

649
00:48:55,872 --> 00:48:59,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Onei Chambara, Bikini Samurai Squad, and Bikini Zombie Slayers.

650
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,163
[SPEAKER_07]: First for 360, second for Wii.

651
00:49:02,804 --> 00:49:07,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill Homecoming on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC.

652
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ultimate Band on DS and Wii.

653
00:49:13,045 --> 00:49:13,446
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

654
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:29,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, Flock was a sheep one by Capcom.

655
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:31,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Boring!

656
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's that, but, you know, you never know.

657
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:37,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, next week's actually pretty exciting for game releases.

658
00:49:37,317 --> 00:49:43,323
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some pretty good stuff coming out, including Star Ocean Last Hope on Xbox 360, which should be pretty epic.

659
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:44,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good reviews so far.

660
00:49:45,505 --> 00:49:48,088
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 Cent Blood on the Sand on PS3 and Xbox 360.

661
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:48,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yes!

662
00:49:51,625 --> 00:50:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Shellshock 2 Blood Trails on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC Legacy of Ys Book 1 and 2 on DS Puzzle Quest Galactrix on DS Dead Rising Chop Till You Drop on the Wii

663
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Stoked on Xbox 360.

664
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,083
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty fun snowboarding game.

665
00:50:15,923 --> 00:50:18,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Ice Champions on DS.

666
00:50:20,027 --> 00:50:22,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly, EAT led the return of Matt Hazard.

667
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:29,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that comes out that week, because I thought it was the week after, but you never know.

668
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:30,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

669
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Killzone 2 on PS3.

670
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:36,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Peggle on DS.

671
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:38,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

672
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: My Personal Diary on DS, Puzzle Challenges and more on Wii.

673
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:51,064
[SPEAKER_05]: UnfoldedRaptor in chat says, Blood on the sand is going to be game of the year.

674
00:50:51,124 --> 00:50:51,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Just watch.

675
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:54,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com live on Sunday nights.

676
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:57,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tempted to buy it just to see.

677
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:00,992
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a part of me that wants to buy it, but it's probably going to be $60, right?

678
00:51:01,652 --> 00:51:02,053
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be $60.

679
00:51:02,733 --> 00:51:03,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy it.

680
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:05,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll wait for it to hit the bargain bin.

681
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, do you know what I saw at Best Buy the other day?

682
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:09,499
[SPEAKER_05]: A Rock Revolution bundle for $30.

683
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,921
[SPEAKER_05]: That's drums and game.

684
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:15,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's just slightly under what they normally cost now.

685
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:18,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's that bad.

686
00:51:18,736 --> 00:51:21,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about it, because you can use the drums with other games, right?

687
00:51:21,818 --> 00:51:23,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they suck that bad.

688
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:24,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

689
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,184
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, hey, if you want, get the game for the download content, because they have some of the Guitar Freak stuff in there.

690
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:32,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that's a good reason.

691
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:33,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it.

692
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:35,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

693
00:51:37,168 --> 00:51:39,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Samurai Dough 3 Samurai Dough 3

694
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:09,397
[SPEAKER_05]: and Rainbow Six Vegas 2 also gets a price reduction.

695
00:52:09,437 --> 00:52:11,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a good week for some sales over there in Japan.

696
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:15,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to the PlayStation 3, NBA Live gets a price reduction.

697
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:22,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, as far as a new game goes, Ryu Ga Gotoku comes out, number three in the series.

698
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:25,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what this is.

699
00:52:25,264 --> 00:52:27,045
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Yakuza 3.

700
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:28,666
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just Yakuza 3?

701
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:29,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

702
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:30,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

703
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:34,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like you can get some romance on in this one.

704
00:52:34,828 --> 00:52:36,049
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get some screenshots from that.

705
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:37,752
[SPEAKER_02]: If they have chicks, you can pick up.

706
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,861
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

707
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:28,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's some King of Fighter fans in the house.

708
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:33,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the Nintendo DS, kind of a range of games.

709
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Dance, Game Center CX, Arino no Chosenju comes out as well.

710
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:43,242
[SPEAKER_05]: A voice chat DS application comes out as well.

711
00:53:43,782 --> 00:53:52,365
[SPEAKER_05]: As Kameko Deluxe DS, Yome Tomeka to Otoko to Ona comes out.

712
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:53,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is...

713
00:53:54,426 --> 00:53:57,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like a little girly adventure game, but there's bowling in it.

714
00:53:58,993 --> 00:54:03,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's like a mini game collection or what, but there's like a little bowling mini game in that.

715
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:05,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not something we're going to get over here.

716
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:18,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, on the PSP, again, in Japan, because sometimes they get stuff before we do, you get a port of Dragon Dance, and Common No Maid Guy, Boyoyan Battle Royale comes out.

717
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:28,442
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an adventure game, not to be confused with the Battle Royale movie that we all know and love, but it does have girls in schoolgirl outfits, and it looks like they're fighting each other.

718
00:54:28,462 --> 00:54:29,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off the manga series.

719
00:54:29,623 --> 00:54:29,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

720
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:32,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And they attack each other with brooms.

721
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this like maids fighting each other?

722
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:36,661
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it looks like.

723
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:39,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it... Yeah, it's in the title.

724
00:54:39,462 --> 00:54:40,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Common, no maid.

725
00:54:40,722 --> 00:54:47,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Maid games are like... Anything maids are like major, major big fetish deals, so... Well, there you have it.

726
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:50,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So you fetish fans, get that on PSP.

727
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:53,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, your memories off, girl style.

728
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:56,287
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that wasn't called your panties off.

729
00:54:56,307 --> 00:54:58,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's an adventure game.

730
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:00,369
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was, that'd be an instant purchase.

731
00:55:02,219 --> 00:55:04,761
[SPEAKER_05]: You might want to go women's style, not girls' style for that.

732
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:10,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And then lastly, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade comes out on the PSP.

733
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:19,612
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an action game that looks a little Final Fantasy-ish, but with some live-action elements in it, it looks like.

734
00:55:19,712 --> 00:55:22,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out on PSP if you're in Japan.

735
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:23,657
[SPEAKER_05]: There you have it.

736
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:24,658
[SPEAKER_05]: That does it for your PSP release date.

737
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:29,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if you want to get it for your friends in America who do a show for you every Sunday.

738
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And DJ Ranma S in chatroom says, yes, maid games do sell.

739
00:55:33,988 --> 00:55:36,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I sell a lot of hentai maid games.

740
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:37,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

741
00:55:39,053 --> 00:55:42,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about something that has absolutely nothing to do with maids?

742
00:55:42,917 --> 00:55:43,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.

743
00:55:44,038 --> 00:55:44,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Bobsleds!

744
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,101
[SPEAKER_05]: How about maid in a bobsled?

745
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:53,387
[SPEAKER_07]: You know there is someone out there who has a fetish for maids on bobsleds.

746
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:54,928
[SPEAKER_07]: But no.

747
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:56,510
[SPEAKER_05]: If so, this show's for you.

748
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,533
[SPEAKER_07]: This is high speed bobsled racing from Sega.

749
00:56:01,414 --> 00:56:03,496
[SPEAKER_07]: God, Sega, why do you do this to me?

750
00:56:04,217 --> 00:56:09,523
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Storm G and it's a deluxe cabinet set where they've got them all lined up.

751
00:56:11,946 --> 00:56:18,293
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's supposed to have you bobsledding in rocket-powered blobs, blobs, bobsleds.

752
00:56:20,712 --> 00:56:21,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Boob sledding?

753
00:56:21,853 --> 00:56:22,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

754
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:25,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Each sled, though... That would be cold!

755
00:56:26,095 --> 00:56:26,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Too cold!

756
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:37,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Each sled, though, accommodates two people, and it has twin joysticks, and each person controls different aspects... Boobs and twin joysticks.

757
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:46,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Each joystick controls different aspects of it to do 360-degree rotation and increase your speed.

758
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:49,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the maid fans would like this game.

759
00:56:50,037 --> 00:56:50,977
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds pretty hot.

760
00:56:53,137 --> 00:56:57,158
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, it's like a 10 minute game and you pay about 650 to play at 600 yen.

761
00:56:58,218 --> 00:57:00,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's already at the Joyopolis in March.

762
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:09,701
[SPEAKER_07]: For any of our Japanese listeners, go there and take pictures of it and get signs of it in play.

763
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:12,101
[SPEAKER_07]: We really, really want to see what it's like.

764
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:15,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun boob sledding with your twin joysticks at Joyopolis.

765
00:57:17,213 --> 00:57:17,574
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

766
00:57:22,697 --> 00:57:39,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if Rocket Bob Sledding isn't for you, there are some other games coming out as well that are equally epic, including the brand new game running on Sega's new hardware, Ring Edge, and the game's called Border Break.

767
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:48,018
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember it as, well, it's sort of like Virtual Lawn, actually, but played a little bit more linear, kind of like Armored Core.

768
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,101
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a mech action fighting game.

769
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:54,114
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

770
00:58:23,053 --> 00:58:24,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Got two out of four right.

771
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:31,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is a little twist to this because I don't actually... I'm not pooping money.

772
00:58:32,663 --> 00:58:36,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually would be buying these new toys that are coming out.

773
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:41,409
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out from... Organic is the name of the toy maker.

774
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:49,855
[SPEAKER_05]: They are taking classic Sega arcade cabinets and shrinking them down to like four inches in length.

775
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:53,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are the four cabinets they're going to be releasing as these little figurine toys.

776
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:55,759
[SPEAKER_07]: These are like little gachapon, basically.

777
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

778
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,722
[SPEAKER_07]: But the capsule game stuff.

779
00:58:59,242 --> 00:59:02,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, they're actual arcade cabinet.

780
00:59:02,845 --> 00:59:04,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they're toys that look like the little cabinets.

781
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,687
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm saying.

782
00:59:05,727 --> 00:59:08,229
[SPEAKER_07]: They're little capsule toys.

783
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:10,931
[SPEAKER_07]: You buy the box and you get a random one out of each box.

784
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:12,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

785
00:59:12,392 --> 00:59:15,715
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't say if they're actual capsule toys or what the thing is going on.

786
00:59:16,576 --> 00:59:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think they're playable.

787
00:59:18,217 --> 00:59:18,818
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.

788
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:19,098
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

789
00:59:20,155 --> 00:59:23,397
[SPEAKER_07]: But those little things, those are very, very, very popular.

790
00:59:23,558 --> 00:59:28,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, getting all the various character and goods that come up.

791
00:59:28,321 --> 00:59:33,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom's actually got a series of little figures for some of the female characters.

792
00:59:33,825 --> 00:59:37,888
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, there is a fifth cabinet that's a secret, according to the website.

793
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:38,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Secret my ass.

794
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:40,269
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what that is?

795
00:59:40,389 --> 00:59:40,609
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

796
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:46,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a... Well, no, it can't be a... Could it be Afterburner?

797
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:48,535
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be an Afterburner, because Afterburner is a closed machine.

798
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:51,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, because it went a little high.

799
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:51,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

800
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:57,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, no, I think it might be an afterburner if they had the cover off of it.

801
00:59:57,117 --> 00:59:58,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a House of the Dead.

802
00:59:58,679 --> 00:59:58,879
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

803
00:59:59,059 --> 00:59:59,440
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

804
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,201
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think you sat down with that one.

805
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:04,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, these are all classic cabinets, so it can't be... Space Harrier?

806
01:00:04,445 --> 01:00:06,467
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be the... There you go, Space Harrier.

807
01:00:06,487 --> 01:00:07,028
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

808
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:08,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, you know what?

809
01:00:08,707 --> 01:00:17,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I think it is an afterburner because Space Harrier, if I'm right, had the closed top, too, and this figure doesn't.

810
01:00:17,171 --> 01:00:20,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it just kind of makes sense, too, with the other games.

811
01:00:20,152 --> 01:00:20,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It would fit in.

812
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:21,393
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

813
01:00:21,613 --> 01:00:23,293
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll probably see when these things come out in the future weeks.

814
01:00:23,313 --> 01:00:25,234
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's one of those Sega 360 machines.

815
01:00:27,375 --> 01:00:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know about some of these.

816
01:00:29,216 --> 01:00:30,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire says, WTF?

817
01:00:30,816 --> 01:00:32,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't play it if it's four inches.

818
01:00:32,917 --> 01:00:35,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Guru says, next up, a miniature Mega Drive.

819
01:00:36,379 --> 01:00:36,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

820
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:38,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Metal Gear Movie

821
01:01:05,034 --> 01:01:09,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know how pissed off I was that they were taking my man off of it.

822
01:01:09,978 --> 01:01:10,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guess what?

823
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:11,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And your man is?

824
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:12,740
[SPEAKER_07]: David Hader.

825
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:14,401
[SPEAKER_07]: He's back on.

826
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:20,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he didn't come right out and say it, but he danced around saying everything, but yes, I'm back.

827
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:30,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So, at an interview, and actually, I'm going to go ahead and actually post a link up to the article, because there's a copy of the interview on there.

828
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:31,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on Kotaku.

829
01:01:33,016 --> 01:01:40,158
[SPEAKER_07]: But in an interview he was basically saying that there's a possibility of involvement in being back on it instead of just saying no.

830
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,219
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be posting that in the chat room so everyone can watch the interview.

831
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:44,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.

832
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:45,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes me happy.

833
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

834
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you love David Hayter.

835
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hell yeah.

836
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he gave us the first X-Men movie.

837
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:54,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's the voice of Solid Snake, so it makes sense.

838
01:01:55,082 --> 01:01:56,202
[SPEAKER_07]: He should just play Snake.

839
01:01:57,742 --> 01:02:06,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, another movie that may have been at one time, but I don't think it's coming out anytime soon, if at all, Mega Man, the movie.

840
01:02:06,965 --> 01:02:16,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, Warner Brothers, at one time, was trying to acquire the rights for the Mega Man series to turn it into a feature film.

841
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:17,689
[SPEAKER_05]: God, no, please don't.

842
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:18,929
[SPEAKER_05]: You know this would be terrible.

843
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:23,711
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be absolute shit if they were to do this as a movie, unless it was animated.

844
01:02:25,071 --> 01:02:27,372
[SPEAKER_05]: You could not do a live-action Mega Man movie, I'm sorry.

845
01:02:27,472 --> 01:02:40,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Capcom, the creators, are wary, letting anyone touch the project after a few disastrous licensing moves with the property as well as the recent so-so reaction to other movie adaptions.

846
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,816
[SPEAKER_02]: The most recent movie made that the suits...

847
01:02:47,118 --> 01:02:58,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The most recent move made was that the suits asked Capcom for a wish list of directors, and Shyamalan, that's right, as in M. Night Shyamalan, was one of the names they came back with.

848
01:03:00,714 --> 01:03:02,715
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, here's the thing.

849
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:05,176
[SPEAKER_05]: M. Night Shyamalan movies have gotten progressively worse, too.

850
01:03:05,196 --> 01:03:06,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but here's the thing, though.

851
01:03:06,677 --> 01:03:08,718
[SPEAKER_02]: He's trying to break out from doing... I did like The Village.

852
01:03:09,438 --> 01:03:10,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, okay.

853
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:14,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough of the actual M. Night Shyamalan movies that he writes and stuff like that.

854
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:23,784
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually trying to break out from doing those types of movies, and that's why he's doing the live-action Avatar movie, which is based off the Nickelodeon animated series.

855
01:03:24,284 --> 01:03:27,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if that turns out okay, then maybe he can...

856
01:03:28,426 --> 01:03:30,387
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru in chat says Avatar the movie will flop

857
01:03:52,566 --> 01:03:53,887
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

858
01:04:17,236 --> 01:04:26,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, granted, a lot of it is still just palette swapping, but they've actually been able to insert some cutscenes into it that fit with the Final Fantasy X story.

859
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:31,499
[SPEAKER_05]: The water scene between Tidus and Yuna is in there, which is kind of interesting.

860
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And look at that title screen just alone.

861
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:38,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe they actually worked that into an 8-bit cartridge.

862
01:04:39,881 --> 01:04:41,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very impressive.

863
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:41,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

864
01:04:41,772 --> 01:04:45,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but seriously, you've got a lot of time on your hands if you're doing that kind of detail.

865
01:04:45,733 --> 01:04:47,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, I'm actually going to play through this.

866
01:04:49,334 --> 01:04:49,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally.

867
01:04:49,895 --> 01:04:53,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks better than that Chinese Final Fantasy VII that was out a little while ago.

868
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:56,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it does look a lot better than the Final Fantasy VII, I'll give you that.

869
01:04:56,657 --> 01:04:57,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks a lot better than that.

870
01:04:58,277 --> 01:05:00,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in GameGuru it says, wasn't there a Final Fantasy VII NES ROM hack?

871
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:01,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there was.

872
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:03,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

873
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so let's move into the classic video game of the week.

874
01:05:08,991 --> 01:05:16,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, every week here at Orange Lounge Radio, we tell you guys, go into your classic archives and find an old game to pay some respect to.

875
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:23,274
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura digs through her own huge archive of games.

876
01:05:23,354 --> 01:05:25,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You told me how many systems, you and Dan counted, right?

877
01:05:25,805 --> 01:05:28,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we came up to 30 to 32, something like that.

878
01:05:28,626 --> 01:05:29,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Systems?

879
01:05:29,187 --> 01:05:29,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

880
01:05:29,907 --> 01:05:30,427
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

881
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've dug through all those archives.

882
01:05:32,688 --> 01:05:37,030
[SPEAKER_07]: That's non-import, non-duplicate systems.

883
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:37,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

884
01:05:38,211 --> 01:05:38,751
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy.

885
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:40,332
[SPEAKER_07]: With the imports, we get up to 40.

886
01:05:40,372 --> 01:05:41,592
[SPEAKER_07]: 40-ish.

887
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:42,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

888
01:05:42,613 --> 01:05:43,633
[SPEAKER_05]: But you still don't have a Pippin.

889
01:05:44,293 --> 01:05:44,814
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with that?

890
01:05:44,914 --> 01:05:45,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

891
01:05:45,954 --> 01:05:53,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and look at the classic video game of the week, which if I'm not mistaken is pretty topical this week, right DarkSakura?

892
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:58,624
[SPEAKER_07]: But before we say the name, you've got to play the music because I know people are going to get it right away.

893
01:05:59,044 --> 01:06:00,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then let me fire up the music here.

894
01:06:00,986 --> 01:06:03,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's a return of video game music to you.

895
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:13,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we all get it, don't we?

896
01:06:13,325 --> 01:06:14,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's the Puzzle Fighter theme.

897
01:06:15,186 --> 01:06:16,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Bite my butt.

898
01:06:17,427 --> 01:06:21,369
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is Street Fighter Alpha 2 or Street Fighter Zero 2.

899
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:27,773
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't mention the first one because as awesome as the first one was, the second one was the best.

900
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,438
[SPEAKER_11]: The first game is no longer canon.

901
01:06:36,778 --> 01:06:38,839
[SPEAKER_11]: The second game replaced the first game's storyline.

902
01:06:40,325 --> 01:06:40,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what he said.

903
01:06:41,405 --> 01:06:53,807
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Street Fighter Alpha 2 basically was the game that gave us the annoying things called Alpha Counters, which I actually kind of like, but I hate doing them by accident.

904
01:06:55,068 --> 01:06:59,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the three-level super combo gauge, air blocking, and fall breaking.

905
01:07:00,668 --> 01:07:08,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank God we didn't get parrying in that one, like in Street Fighter 3, because parrying while cool was a pain in the ass.

906
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:23,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so basically, it's, uh, and I honestly think this is pretty much the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series, because Alpha 3 was kind of ass, except for some of the characters in it, and I hated the A-ism, B-ism, I hated taking all that shit.

907
01:07:25,514 --> 01:07:38,266
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway, this also had Akuma as a regular character, or as he was in the Japanese version, Golki, which I think is a better name, especially if you consider the current storyline that it was Golki versus Golken.

908
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:44,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyway, so you actually got Shin Akuma as your secret opponent.

909
01:07:45,092 --> 01:07:50,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone brought in the rival thing, which I was really glad they put that in Street Fighter IV, the whole...

910
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:55,324
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, um, you also, um, have, uh, Instantly Selectable, you have Bison, um, who was...

911
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Vega in the Japanese version, Akuma and Dan.

912
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:15,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You also got three characters who are returning from other games.

913
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:22,768
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Zangief and Dhalsim, and then you got Gen, who was from the first Street Fighter game.

914
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:31,232
[SPEAKER_07]: You also got Rolento from Final Fight, and Sakura, who was the first original new character for that series, and I thought it was really cool.

915
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:34,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even for the second one that came out, for Alpha 2.

916
01:08:35,554 --> 01:08:35,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway,

917
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:42,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very happy though when they started bringing in the Final Fight characters because I freaking love Final Fight.

918
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:46,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been collecting every version of Final Fight, except for the American-made crap versions.

919
01:08:50,605 --> 01:08:52,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't Dan count as an original character as well?

920
01:08:53,522 --> 01:09:20,824
[SPEAKER_07]: on top of that, for anyone who doesn't know he's totally a parody of Art of Fighting because Rio and Robert Garcia were combined to make Dan, he was a big joke however, if you can beat the game with him mad props to you if you can beat Puzzle Fighter with him, mad props to you so Drew says real men play Dan

921
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:26,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so you've got all your characters.

922
01:09:26,808 --> 01:09:30,191
[SPEAKER_07]: You have, you know, basically different versions of them.

923
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,653
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got arcade versions on the consoles.

924
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:38,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this is going to be me bitching for just a moment.

925
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:46,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The Super NES... Well, the other two ran out.

926
01:09:47,346 --> 01:09:47,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Chun-Li.

927
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,462
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a game where I decided that Chun-Li is a bitch.

928
01:09:52,682 --> 01:10:00,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, there was a Super Nintendo version of this released in 96.

929
01:10:02,445 --> 01:10:08,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I had this for a while before it was removed from my possession without me knowing.

930
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:08,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Die.

931
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:17,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the version that made use of the SDD-1 chip for graphic decompression.

932
01:10:18,472 --> 01:10:20,814
[SPEAKER_07]: So guess what it put into a cartridge game?

933
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:22,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Load time.

934
01:10:23,326 --> 01:10:30,333
[SPEAKER_07]: It had, now loading, in a freaking SNES cartridge, it had to decompress and load.

935
01:10:30,714 --> 01:10:33,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, damn, this is slow.

936
01:10:35,559 --> 01:10:40,544
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also a PC version that was based off the PlayStation version.

937
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay, I actually have that somewhere in my house.

938
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:53,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was the home versions that came out of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, um, which in Japan came out of Street Fighter Zero 2 Dash.

939
01:10:55,254 --> 01:11:00,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it was also part of the Street Fighter collection that was a big compilation.

940
01:11:01,117 --> 01:11:11,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then there was, um, the, uh, in the Gold version it had Kami based on her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance.

941
01:11:11,023 --> 01:11:11,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Um.

942
01:11:12,283 --> 01:11:32,580
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was she was actually a hidden character character that was selectable in the versus and training modes so that was pretty cool also on PlayStation 2 we got Street Fighter Alpha Anthology which is more like the arcade version of the game it was pretty cool

943
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:38,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually got both the Saturn and the PlayStation versions.

944
01:11:38,103 --> 01:11:40,204
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Saturn version, way better.

945
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:41,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Way better.

946
01:11:41,585 --> 01:11:45,087
[SPEAKER_07]: It's far better than the PlayStation version was.

947
01:11:45,207 --> 01:11:49,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, anything 2D, practically, the Saturn version is going to be better.

948
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:57,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Better colors, better... It can handle 2D graphics and sound so much better than the PlayStation version.

949
01:11:58,575 --> 01:11:59,095
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate...

950
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:12,819
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually... In 1996, Dan won number one video game character, and Sakura won number three video game character, which I thought was funny.

951
01:12:12,859 --> 01:12:18,700
[SPEAKER_07]: That was actually in Gamest Magazine, which is a Japanese magazine.

952
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:24,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Got best fighting game, number nine best in graphics, number six best direction, number four best video game music.

953
01:12:24,822 --> 01:12:25,682
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty cool.

954
01:12:26,922 --> 01:12:27,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

955
01:12:30,103 --> 01:12:52,976
[SPEAKER_07]: it's seriously oh you got roses roses in Street Fighter 4 I thought it was cool yep um but it's it's just a really it to me it is the pinnacle of the Street Fighter series I mean I love Street Fighter 4 and I actually I like Street Fighter 3 for just playing as Ibuki um but other than that I mean Street Fighter Alpha 2 is like the top of it for me it does not get better than that

956
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:55,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well there you have it.

957
01:12:55,497 --> 01:12:58,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Your classic video game of the week, Street Fighter Alpha 2.

958
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:03,122
[SPEAKER_05]: A very good topical pick, considering the game that's on everybody's mind this week.

959
01:13:03,182 --> 01:13:11,927
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to take a minute to respect the classics that help inspire some of the appearances you see in Street Fighter 4, such as Rose, and Sakura, and Dan, and so on.

960
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:14,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's going to do it for Part A of our show.

961
01:13:14,448 --> 01:13:15,268
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't go anywhere.

962
01:13:15,408 --> 01:13:15,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Darn it.

963
01:13:15,748 --> 01:13:17,288
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got plenty more of our show to come up.

964
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:27,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Part B. Since Drew and Joe and everybody joined us late, I'll ask them about their gaming weeks at the start of Part B. And then we have some stuff to get into as well.

965
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:28,771
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about the DSi.

966
01:13:28,851 --> 01:13:30,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally got a release date in North America.

967
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:34,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Confirming some earlier rumors that were floating around out there.

968
01:13:34,272 --> 01:13:34,812
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so weird.

969
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:36,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so weird how that happens.

970
01:13:36,593 --> 01:13:41,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to talk about some video game law here in California and some other Wii rumors.

971
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:42,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go anywhere.

972
01:13:42,934 --> 01:13:45,475
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

973
01:13:51,897 --> 01:13:54,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

974
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:57,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Here on this lovely Sunday evening, February the 22nd of 2009.

975
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,101
[SPEAKER_05]: We're watching Loki playing Noby Noby Boy on Justin.TV and just giggling at the little farting noises it's making.

976
01:14:04,342 --> 01:14:06,942
[SPEAKER_07]: The secret word, Rob, is parakeet.

977
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:08,363
Ah!

978
01:14:09,957 --> 01:14:12,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Space Squirrel in the corner What kind of games have you been playing lately?

979
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:38,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty good.

980
01:14:39,748 --> 01:14:54,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Kim came to visit, so brought over the PS2, played some Karaoke Revolution, some Guitar Hero, King of Fighters 06, and surprisingly, a little bit of the original Naruto Ultimate Ninja.

981
01:14:55,521 --> 01:14:57,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why we were playing it, but we were playing it.

982
01:14:58,603 --> 01:14:59,844
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to because I was bored.

983
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:01,906
[SPEAKER_08]: You asked for it.

984
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:04,308
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the one who suggested it, not me.

985
01:15:06,385 --> 01:15:08,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I just so happen to bring it with me

986
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:33,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually picked up Need for Speed Underground.

987
01:15:33,617 --> 01:15:34,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how's that?

988
01:15:34,737 --> 01:15:35,478
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of cool.

989
01:15:35,758 --> 01:15:36,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get the second one.

990
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,080
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it different from other Need for Speed games?

991
01:15:40,021 --> 01:15:40,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

992
01:15:40,281 --> 01:15:42,502
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of emphasis on tuning your car.

993
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:45,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Making it look cool.

994
01:15:45,284 --> 01:15:46,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like pimp my ride?

995
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

996
01:15:47,905 --> 01:15:48,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Only more fun.

997
01:15:50,247 --> 01:15:50,627
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

998
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:51,207
[SPEAKER_05]: We got you.

999
01:15:51,988 --> 01:15:52,268
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1000
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:52,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool, cool.

1001
01:15:53,109 --> 01:15:57,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it looks like Loki's got everything switched back on Justin.TV from our break.

1002
01:15:58,072 --> 01:15:58,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

1003
01:15:58,372 --> 01:15:58,772
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

1004
01:15:59,192 --> 01:16:00,153
[SPEAKER_05]: We not getting audio over there?

1005
01:16:01,795 --> 01:16:02,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

1006
01:16:03,795 --> 01:16:04,576
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

1007
01:16:05,316 --> 01:16:06,416
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be some feedback.

1008
01:16:07,356 --> 01:16:08,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Live radio.

1009
01:16:08,256 --> 01:16:13,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at allgames.com.

1010
01:16:15,358 --> 01:16:17,979
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't see video, just audio for some reason on Justin.TV.

1011
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:20,359
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, Justin.TV is not the top priority.

1012
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:23,620
[SPEAKER_05]: We are trying to do a radio show, so we'll figure it out one way or another, I guess.

1013
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:28,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I want to get back into gaming news, but we need Loki.

1014
01:16:30,287 --> 01:16:32,007
[SPEAKER_05]: The Nintendo DSi was announced this week that it would be coming out in the U.S.

1015
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:34,548
[SPEAKER_05]: and the rest of North America on April 5th.

1016
01:16:54,397 --> 01:16:58,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is pretty close to estimates made by certain media outlets.

1017
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:04,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will be coming out in the North American region in two different colors.

1018
01:17:04,544 --> 01:17:07,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Both black and kind of a light blue.

1019
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:11,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And will be retailing for $169.99.

1020
01:17:11,768 --> 01:17:15,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat, I guess.

1021
01:17:18,013 --> 01:17:18,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.

1022
01:17:19,774 --> 01:17:21,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not probably going to pick one up myself.

1023
01:17:22,455 --> 01:17:22,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1024
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:25,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1025
01:17:47,588 --> 01:17:48,089
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1026
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:02,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Super Game!

1027
01:18:20,037 --> 01:18:21,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Swap cartridges, I guess.

1028
01:18:21,438 --> 01:18:25,320
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with the blue DSi for me, and we have Actdeft in chat, says, I like the blue DSi.

1029
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:28,022
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with the blue DSi for me, it's one of my high school's colors.

1030
01:18:28,122 --> 01:18:30,003
[SPEAKER_05]: My old high school, that was actually one of their colors.

1031
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:32,045
[SPEAKER_05]: That gross, light blue type color.

1032
01:18:32,345 --> 01:18:32,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah.

1033
01:18:33,466 --> 01:18:34,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Not my favorite.

1034
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:43,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming out on April 5th, a game that I'm sure a lot of our long-time listeners who are into music games, since that's what we started on, would be interested in.

1035
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:47,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhythm Heaven, also known as, of course, Rhythm Tengoku overseas.

1036
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:52,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Rhythm Heaven is going to be coming out on April 5th as well as the DSi systems.

1037
01:18:53,272 --> 01:18:57,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know, this game was made by the same people that made WarioWare.

1038
01:18:57,314 --> 01:19:00,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something like that, but it's more with music.

1039
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hard to explain this game.

1040
01:19:02,397 --> 01:19:03,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it at PAX.

1041
01:19:04,358 --> 01:19:09,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game has kind of been ready a little while, but it's kind of some cool little musical mini-games.

1042
01:19:10,183 --> 01:19:12,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there'll be a lot of folks that enjoy that.

1043
01:19:12,945 --> 01:19:19,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love this little alien character in the game too, and I've seen that on people's live journal icons and stuff, so there you go.

1044
01:19:20,931 --> 01:19:25,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is coming out as well on April 5th, and I'm sure there'll be plenty of folks getting copies of that.

1045
01:19:27,319 --> 01:19:32,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's actually supposed to be more games coming out.

1046
01:19:32,904 --> 01:19:42,932
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that they're working on an adaptation of Katamari Damacy and Mr. Driller for the DSiWare, according to Famitsu, anyway.

1047
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:54,241
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also going to be a Wii game of Mr. Driller, Mr. Driller World, that has a DS version that's supposed to be called... Oh my god, how am I going to pronounce this?

1048
01:19:55,742 --> 01:19:56,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to try...

1049
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:00,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I butcher names all the time in the Japanese release dates.

1050
01:20:00,659 --> 01:20:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1051
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:10,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Sekuto Hamureru Horihori Action which will have 17 levels to be out in Japan next week.

1052
01:20:12,442 --> 01:20:12,782
[SPEAKER_07]: So there.

1053
01:20:13,062 --> 01:20:16,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Catanagram in chat says that Katamari game is just a re-skinned pack attack.

1054
01:20:17,303 --> 01:20:17,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap.

1055
01:20:19,243 --> 01:20:19,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap.

1056
01:20:21,224 --> 01:20:21,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Not surprising.

1057
01:20:22,544 --> 01:20:27,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they better make these releases good or people are going to say all these DSi things are cheap.

1058
01:20:28,035 --> 01:20:28,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1059
01:20:54,375 --> 01:21:00,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, for whatever reason, I guess us Americans can't handle white.

1060
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:01,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be blue.

1061
01:21:04,342 --> 01:21:04,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1062
01:21:07,424 --> 01:21:12,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting as well that Europe usually gets screwed by Nintendo on release dates, but now it's...

1063
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:15,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1064
01:21:41,613 --> 01:21:46,215
[SPEAKER_05]: They finally signed a budget middle of last week after what, like 106, 109 days, something crazy.

1065
01:21:46,715 --> 01:21:52,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe they didn't pass the budget on time because they were too busy dealing with video game laws.

1066
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:53,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess what?

1067
01:21:53,957 --> 01:22:00,819
[SPEAKER_05]: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals came down this week and said that the California game law has been stricken.

1068
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:08,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they came out and placed a permanent injunction on it and it's no longer there.

1069
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:22,052
[SPEAKER_05]: The ESA President Michael Gallagher says this is a win, saying it sends a clear signal that these types of reckless legislations, it's wasting taxpayers' money, government time, and state resources.

1070
01:22:22,192 --> 01:22:31,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Leland Yee, who has been heavily involved in this bill and everything, is pushing for California to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

1071
01:22:31,519 --> 01:22:34,541
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I believe as a part of this, we will have to pay the ESV fees.

1072
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:39,043
[SPEAKER_05]: or ESA fees for this, just like another state had to do not that long ago.

1073
01:22:39,063 --> 01:22:40,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember we covered on the show.

1074
01:22:40,584 --> 01:22:42,665
[SPEAKER_05]: What a great thing for a broke state to be doing.

1075
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you guys should just give up on that whole thing.

1076
01:22:48,929 --> 01:22:53,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever we talk about these video game laws and them trying to censor video games and all this stuff, we get angsty.

1077
01:22:53,911 --> 01:22:56,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we get angsty, FUs of the Week happen.

1078
01:23:13,775 --> 01:23:17,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe it or not, I don't have any FUs.

1079
01:23:18,058 --> 01:23:20,000
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I take that back, I do.

1080
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,761
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to people who don't know how to grow the fuck up.

1081
01:23:23,542 --> 01:23:30,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And before anyone says anything, it's not who people may think I'm talking about, so... I knew you were talking about me.

1082
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:31,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it.

1083
01:23:31,928 --> 01:23:32,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Bitch!

1084
01:23:32,228 --> 01:23:32,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

1085
01:23:32,789 --> 01:23:33,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna cut you.

1086
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,052
[SPEAKER_07]: No, shoot, okay, I'm not gonna go into detail, but I have...

1087
01:23:37,938 --> 01:23:39,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll go into a little detail.

1088
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:44,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend who, as long as I have known this person...

1089
01:23:47,037 --> 01:23:48,058
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty, Loki.

1090
01:24:16,687 --> 01:24:21,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy for the second week in a row to the weather for ruining yet another Airsoft outing.

1091
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I was supposed to be going on Sunday today, this morning.

1092
01:24:25,932 --> 01:24:29,333
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it is raining and will continue to rain until next Sunday.

1093
01:24:29,854 --> 01:24:31,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so retarded.

1094
01:24:31,334 --> 01:24:35,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It was clear all week long and then fucking rained on Sunday.

1095
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:37,698
[SPEAKER_02]: The day that I'm going.

1096
01:24:38,878 --> 01:24:40,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck you, Mother Nature.

1097
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:41,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you right up your ass.

1098
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:45,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it possible to fuck Mother Nature in her ass?

1099
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:45,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

1100
01:24:46,758 --> 01:24:53,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I just, I'm gonna say an FU to the fact I'm kinda hungry, and so I'm gonna eat something soon.

1101
01:24:54,743 --> 01:24:55,544
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to hunger pains.

1102
01:24:56,365 --> 01:24:58,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Drew, you got any FUs?

1103
01:25:00,467 --> 01:25:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1104
01:25:01,328 --> 01:25:04,510
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, FU to shitty service at... Huh?

1105
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:08,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, FU to shitty service at the Arden Fair Mall today.

1106
01:25:09,874 --> 01:25:11,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1107
01:25:11,855 --> 01:25:14,737
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 minutes to prepare a meal at the Hibachi.

1108
01:25:15,637 --> 01:25:16,158
[SPEAKER_12]: What the fuck?

1109
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:17,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I order.

1110
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Somehow there's a line formed.

1111
01:25:19,241 --> 01:25:21,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, let's not go to Panda Express.

1112
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:22,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to Hibachi-san.

1113
01:25:22,802 --> 01:25:25,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to Hibachi-san, I said.

1114
01:25:25,202 --> 01:25:26,423
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no line, I said.

1115
01:25:26,963 --> 01:25:27,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no.

1116
01:25:28,643 --> 01:25:31,164
[SPEAKER_12]: On top of everything else, we try to get portraits taken.

1117
01:25:31,764 --> 01:25:33,205
[SPEAKER_12]: And that shit takes an hour and a half.

1118
01:25:33,865 --> 01:25:35,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Causing us to be late for the show.

1119
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:38,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not too pleased.

1120
01:25:38,807 --> 01:25:40,047
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, fuck you to the weather.

1121
01:25:40,267 --> 01:25:41,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck it in its fucking ear.

1122
01:25:42,107 --> 01:25:43,208
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sick and tired of it.

1123
01:25:44,315 --> 01:25:47,236
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sunny and then suddenly it rains.

1124
01:25:47,857 --> 01:25:49,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Way to end the week on a good note.

1125
01:25:52,058 --> 01:25:52,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Kim, did you have anything?

1126
01:25:53,419 --> 01:25:54,439
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to being sick.

1127
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate being sick on vacation.

1128
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:56,961
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucks.

1129
01:25:57,381 --> 01:25:58,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Being sick does suck.

1130
01:25:58,981 --> 01:25:59,362
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1131
01:26:00,302 --> 01:26:02,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And Joe, do you have anything for our listeners for angst?

1132
01:26:03,543 --> 01:26:06,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, fuck being hungry.

1133
01:26:07,185 --> 01:26:08,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck being hungry.

1134
01:26:08,966 --> 01:26:09,266
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1135
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:13,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.

1136
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:15,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Sakura.

1137
01:26:16,772 --> 01:26:19,015
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a very interesting way that you just said my name.

1138
01:26:19,876 --> 01:26:20,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Sakura.

1139
01:26:21,258 --> 01:26:21,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1140
01:26:22,339 --> 01:26:23,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Disney!

1141
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:34,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Disney is bringing Spectrobes Origins to Wii, supposed to be coming out in the fall.

1142
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:42,858
[SPEAKER_07]: It's motion sensing, you know, large real-time battle thing, full 3D RPG world, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

1143
01:26:43,639 --> 01:26:56,092
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are the two DS versions, Spectrobes and Spectrobes Beyond the Portals, are already everywhere, so it's more Spectrobes.

1144
01:26:57,313 --> 01:26:57,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay?

1145
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,095
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

1146
01:27:01,631 --> 01:27:02,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, the end.

1147
01:27:02,591 --> 01:27:03,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be pretty good.

1148
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:04,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1149
01:27:04,253 --> 01:27:09,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not a game I'm remotely interested in, but from what I hear, it's supposed to be pretty good.

1150
01:27:09,497 --> 01:27:10,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been popular, I guess.

1151
01:27:11,238 --> 01:27:12,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it maybe just for a particular audience?

1152
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:20,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, what they're doing now, they're actually launching, I think, a cartoon as well, which will help because it's kind of like Pokemon.

1153
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:23,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the game is very Pokemon, Digimon-esque, so...

1154
01:27:25,888 --> 01:27:28,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, really not from my age group at all.

1155
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:35,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, Refresh Memory Spectrums, wasn't that gimmicky bullshit game where you had to yell at the things to turn them into little monsters?

1156
01:27:36,233 --> 01:27:45,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that, but it was the one that had the special cards that you place over the DS touchscreen where you tap the spots and it will unlock different things.

1157
01:27:46,819 --> 01:27:46,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1158
01:27:48,035 --> 01:27:50,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so anyways, it's supposed to be pretty decent.

1159
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:52,262
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they're trying to be innovative with it.

1160
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:56,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't know, maybe they'll bring their D-Gamer service over onto the Wii.

1161
01:27:56,549 --> 01:27:57,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be pretty sweet.

1162
01:27:57,951 --> 01:27:58,933
[SPEAKER_02]: But I doubt it.

1163
01:27:59,994 --> 01:28:00,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt it a lot.

1164
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:09,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, if you're not interested though in Spectrobes, there are some rumors of other games that are coming out that might be worth it.

1165
01:28:10,598 --> 01:28:13,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Brutal Legends is rumored to possibly coming out to the Wii.

1166
01:28:14,299 --> 01:28:16,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's interesting.

1167
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:17,580
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other stuff.

1168
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently this is all from EA and Activision's 2009 lineup.

1169
01:28:21,661 --> 01:28:25,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision's DJ Hero is tentatively scheduled for July.

1170
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:29,851
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a weird time to put that out if that were actually the case.

1171
01:28:31,271 --> 01:28:38,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, DJ Hero will feature a three... The peripheral will feature three colored buttons, a turntable, and a fader.

1172
01:28:39,894 --> 01:28:41,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if that's the case, they're in for a lawsuit.

1173
01:28:43,956 --> 01:28:47,838
[SPEAKER_02]: This second LEGO Indiana Jones game will be out apparently before Christmas.

1174
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:49,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that.

1175
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:53,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Activision will release a new Guitar Hero song pack around the holiday season.

1176
01:28:54,461 --> 01:29:01,004
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of goes in line with, I think there was a Guitar Hero Greatest Hits or something like that they're planning on putting out.

1177
01:29:01,564 --> 01:29:02,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might make sense.

1178
01:29:04,805 --> 01:29:07,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Wars Battlefront 3 is still live but probably won't be out until 2010.

1179
01:29:07,987 --> 01:29:09,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course that makes sense.

1180
01:29:09,848 --> 01:29:12,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, even though, was it...

1181
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:15,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Pandemic, who am I thinking of?

1182
01:29:16,825 --> 01:29:17,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, whatever.

1183
01:29:18,065 --> 01:29:20,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, a game like that, very epic.

1184
01:29:20,307 --> 01:29:21,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they're going to make another one.

1185
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:24,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all rumors for right now.

1186
01:29:24,909 --> 01:29:25,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Rumors.

1187
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that we might see a little more of at E3.

1188
01:29:28,171 --> 01:29:38,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, going to the DJ Hero thing, you know, I've seen prototypes of the other DJ game coming out in...

1189
01:29:40,706 --> 01:29:48,632
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the case, if it's got a crossfader and stuff, that makes me kind of wonder if there might be a lawsuit because their controller looks very similar.

1190
01:29:49,432 --> 01:29:49,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1191
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:50,813
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

1192
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:53,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Lego.

1193
01:29:53,495 --> 01:29:54,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Gosh, those Lego games.

1194
01:29:54,516 --> 01:29:55,376
[SPEAKER_05]: They sure know how to sell.

1195
01:29:55,396 --> 01:29:58,258
[SPEAKER_05]: The Lego Batman, the Lego Star Wars, Lego Indiana Jones.

1196
01:29:58,278 --> 01:29:59,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what's next?

1197
01:30:00,882 --> 01:30:02,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Lego Prince of Persia

1198
01:30:22,344 --> 01:30:25,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But you never know, could be a game later on.

1199
01:30:25,345 --> 01:30:27,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Lego Harry Potter's the next one, for sure.

1200
01:30:27,566 --> 01:30:31,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, other than Lego Battles, but in Lego MMO, maybe Lego Racers.

1201
01:30:31,868 --> 01:30:36,730
[SPEAKER_05]: No Lego Prince of Persia game yet, but Lego Prince of Persia toys are definitely going to be happening.

1202
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:38,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see them doing a Lego Harry Potter game.

1203
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:40,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I could really see that too.

1204
01:30:40,412 --> 01:30:42,652
[SPEAKER_05]: The audiences kind of go hand in hand.

1205
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:47,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Veto Veto Veto Veto Veto

1206
01:31:15,478 --> 01:31:17,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Me giving DarkSakura the finger makes for great radio.

1207
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:18,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Although Justin TV can see it.

1208
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:20,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob's a cheeky monkey.

1209
01:31:21,081 --> 01:31:21,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheeky monkey.

1210
01:31:22,281 --> 01:31:23,222
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, males.

1211
01:31:24,843 --> 01:31:26,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one's kind of a plug.

1212
01:31:26,864 --> 01:31:28,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you saw this email.

1213
01:31:28,105 --> 01:31:28,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go ahead and plug it.

1214
01:31:28,785 --> 01:31:29,045
[SPEAKER_05]: A plug.

1215
01:31:29,285 --> 01:31:29,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1216
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:33,828
[SPEAKER_07]: We hear from Redertainment.

1217
01:31:35,388 --> 01:31:37,890
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hawk by Hunter Red Novel

1218
01:31:56,519 --> 01:31:57,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Free distribution online.

1219
01:31:58,419 --> 01:32:01,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Advocate literacy.

1220
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:05,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So, first actual email.

1221
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:07,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see DarkSakura doing a PSA for reading.

1222
01:32:08,022 --> 01:32:08,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Read, goddammit!

1223
01:32:10,683 --> 01:32:11,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Read or you're crap!

1224
01:32:14,343 --> 01:32:15,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Read something, you idiot!

1225
01:32:15,184 --> 01:32:16,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Illiteracy is stupid!

1226
01:32:17,685 --> 01:32:18,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, now...

1227
01:32:39,893 --> 01:32:45,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, with regard to you and your wind complaints tonight, it could be worse.

1228
01:32:45,258 --> 01:32:51,423
[SPEAKER_07]: At least you folks don't have planes crashing in your area, just in case other listeners don't remember me mentioning it before.

1229
01:32:51,463 --> 01:32:52,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in Buffalo, New York.

1230
01:32:53,345 --> 01:32:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we do have planes crashing in our area.

1231
01:32:55,607 --> 01:32:58,789
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one that crashed, I think, in Elk Grove or something.

1232
01:32:58,809 --> 01:32:59,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear about that.

1233
01:33:01,411 --> 01:33:08,861
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy was doing takeoff and touchdown landings and one of those landings he forgot to lower the landing gear and caught the plane on fire.

1234
01:33:10,824 --> 01:33:11,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one got hurt.

1235
01:33:11,525 --> 01:33:12,286
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only one pilot.

1236
01:33:12,306 --> 01:33:13,528
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's a plane crash.

1237
01:33:13,548 --> 01:33:13,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It counts.

1238
01:33:17,016 --> 01:33:18,217
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a crash due to stupid.

1239
01:33:20,799 --> 01:33:27,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, in case you haven't read, seen, listened to the news for the last past few days, there was a commercial plane crash, blah, blah, blah.

1240
01:33:27,184 --> 01:33:31,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Buffalo, last Thursday night, specifically in the suburb of Clarence, at least, you're just dealing with wind.

1241
01:33:32,488 --> 01:33:33,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you've been negated.

1242
01:33:34,801 --> 01:33:43,706
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, and if DarkSakura has time to read this, I'd just like to say hi, in quotes, to the Dark Fury link shell on the Alexander server in Final Fantasy XI.

1243
01:33:43,866 --> 01:33:44,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Add it!

1244
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:49,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And specifically to Jaden, Nagiko, and Digby Reloaded.

1245
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:50,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Now go play a real game.

1246
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:51,650
[SPEAKER_07]: That was from Spazinator.

1247
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:52,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

1248
01:33:54,352 --> 01:33:55,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always so rude.

1249
01:33:55,312 --> 01:33:56,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Go play a real game.

1250
01:33:56,313 --> 01:33:56,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Play Perfect World.

1251
01:33:57,033 --> 01:34:00,495
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent years and years and years on Final Fantasy XI, just in case you guys don't know.

1252
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:04,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And City of Heroes, I'm sorry, is WoW without the suck.

1253
01:34:07,437 --> 01:34:08,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It's WoW with Barbie.

1254
01:34:08,518 --> 01:34:09,638
[SPEAKER_07]: It's WoW with superheroes.

1255
01:34:09,758 --> 01:34:10,978
[SPEAKER_05]: It's WoW with Barbie mode.

1256
01:34:10,998 --> 01:34:11,779
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fun!

1257
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:15,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, making the superhero, and you can save them.

1258
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Just let me know when the hell I can debate it.

1259
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:19,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so great.

1260
01:34:19,961 --> 01:34:22,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I've made so many superhero costumes in the last week.

1261
01:34:23,303 --> 01:34:27,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Because every time I would actually try to log in and play the damn game, lose connection, log out.

1262
01:34:28,945 --> 01:34:29,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you.

1263
01:34:29,945 --> 01:34:30,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Dope.

1264
01:34:30,808 --> 01:34:32,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's another story.

1265
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:33,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, was that it for mailbag?

1266
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:34,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email.

1267
01:34:34,551 --> 01:34:35,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, one more, yay.

1268
01:34:36,073 --> 01:34:38,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez, Rob, I could just not read it.

1269
01:34:38,155 --> 01:34:41,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, when I went in there earlier, there was only like two emails, so I'm happy to hear there's more emails.

1270
01:34:41,978 --> 01:34:43,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's actually from the same guy.

1271
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:44,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1272
01:34:45,081 --> 01:34:46,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he sent the email late.

1273
01:34:46,863 --> 01:34:47,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we go.

1274
01:34:47,944 --> 01:34:48,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just read it anyway.

1275
01:34:49,185 --> 01:34:49,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1276
01:34:49,445 --> 01:34:51,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, folks, I just wanted to comment on a few things.

1277
01:34:51,747 --> 01:34:53,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Firstly, firstly is not a word, okay?

1278
01:34:53,549 --> 01:34:56,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Just say first, or first of all, or...

1279
01:34:57,472 --> 01:35:03,834
[SPEAKER_07]: In the beginning, no, FYI, I sent you an email last week during, during, only should have one R in it, thank you.

1280
01:35:04,455 --> 01:35:06,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently, I sent it too late.

1281
01:35:07,436 --> 01:35:08,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Not T-O-T-O-O, thank you.

1282
01:35:09,577 --> 01:35:11,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, you send late emails, you get grammar-nated.

1283
01:35:14,578 --> 01:35:21,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Needless to say, that it can be disregarded simply because I ended up calling in and repeated what was in the email.

1284
01:35:21,721 --> 01:35:24,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Secondly, like, okay, Rob, your name is not Robb.

1285
01:35:26,604 --> 01:35:27,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up getting Flower too.

1286
01:35:27,664 --> 01:35:29,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he was drunk when he did the email.

1287
01:35:29,645 --> 01:35:32,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

1288
01:35:32,845 --> 01:35:34,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, it's a great game and very beautiful.

1289
01:35:35,046 --> 01:35:36,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only that, but it's rather relaxing.

1290
01:35:37,386 --> 01:35:41,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to call it a casual game, seeing as the term doesn't quite seem to fit the game.

1291
01:35:41,767 --> 01:35:45,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Rather, I think calling Flower a zen game seems to describe it a bit better.

1292
01:35:45,567 --> 01:35:48,688
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, here's an easy way to get two trophies for it.

1293
01:35:49,088 --> 01:35:53,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Play a level as normal, go do something for 10 minutes between levels, and bam, one trophy unlocked.

1294
01:35:54,609 --> 01:35:57,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one can be unlocked by simply backing out of the game.

1295
01:35:57,631 --> 01:35:59,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Fast forward the system clock by a week and re-enter the game.

1296
01:36:00,033 --> 01:36:00,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you'll get the second trophy.

1297
01:36:00,974 --> 01:36:04,416
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think though about the analogy that it's a racing game?

1298
01:36:04,657 --> 01:36:06,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Flowers is just a big fruity racing game.

1299
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:16,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure the email, if it could grow sentience and speak on its own on behalf of Spazinator, it would probably tell you boobs.

1300
01:36:17,921 --> 01:36:26,308
[SPEAKER_07]: On an unrelated note, Rob commented that $60 for a game is kind of expensive, especially if you're only somewhat into a given series.

1301
01:36:26,749 --> 01:36:31,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would just like to point out that with the previous gen systems in their games...

1302
01:36:31,573 --> 01:36:38,855
[SPEAKER_07]: When taking inflation into consideration, the older games are just as expensive as current-gen games, and in some situations, even more expensive.

1303
01:36:39,415 --> 01:36:41,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for allowing me to throw in my two cents.

1304
01:36:41,936 --> 01:36:45,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Inflation, dude, it should be two bucks, and better bring chocolate with that.

1305
01:36:45,717 --> 01:36:51,299
[SPEAKER_07]: This email is sponsored by GTA 4, Lost in the Damned, and Oscar Mayer, home of the never-ending supply of wieners.

1306
01:36:52,805 --> 01:36:53,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I like being a rampaging bitch.

1307
01:37:08,567 --> 01:37:14,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote Flower No, I didn't play Flower until this week No, I was talking about the $60 No, I was reading the comment in chat

1308
01:37:29,245 --> 01:37:29,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1309
01:37:31,466 --> 01:37:33,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week's show is on the server.

1310
01:37:33,486 --> 01:37:34,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to push it to the podcast feed.

1311
01:37:34,906 --> 01:37:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: We do it a little differently now on the new website.

1312
01:37:37,407 --> 01:37:40,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of botched the first one, I think.

1313
01:37:40,448 --> 01:37:42,368
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm being a little careful before I do 3.13.

1314
01:37:43,609 --> 01:37:47,369
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am trying to get the podcast all caught up so people don't complain anymore.

1315
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:48,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So there we go.

1316
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:53,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move back into some gaming news.

1317
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:55,132
[SPEAKER_05]: More emails though.

1318
01:37:55,353 --> 01:37:58,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Don't send them.

1319
01:37:59,214 --> 01:38:00,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Send them, please.

1320
01:38:02,456 --> 01:38:02,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1321
01:38:03,936 --> 01:38:04,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being silly.

1322
01:38:06,164 --> 01:38:14,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, apparently, once again, there's more rumors pointing to the next Tony Hawk game using a brand new skateboarding controller.

1323
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we're going to see this at E3.

1324
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:20,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it only makes sense that they're going to pull this stuff out.

1325
01:38:23,456 --> 01:38:32,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Variety is confirming this, saying their sources show a new controller along with some details.

1326
01:38:32,301 --> 01:38:34,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, it won't be about precise balance.

1327
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:42,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it will be about grabbing and manipulating the board to pull all sorts of tricks from which Tony Hawk games are known for.

1328
01:38:44,847 --> 01:38:45,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1329
01:38:46,508 --> 01:38:49,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Something tells me that this... I don't know.

1330
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:49,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1331
01:38:51,129 --> 01:38:59,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't we just have the Tony Hawk Pro Skater stuff where it was fun, it was whimsical, you're pulling off tricks in a mall or something ridiculous.

1332
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:02,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Or why can't we just fire Tony Hawk out of a cannon at this point?

1333
01:39:02,074 --> 01:39:03,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm just kind of done.

1334
01:39:03,154 --> 01:39:05,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Tony Hawk's fault, okay?

1335
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:08,977
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just like the same argument that an actor ruins a movie.

1336
01:39:09,557 --> 01:39:12,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that may be the case sometimes, but it's not Tony Hawk's fault.

1337
01:39:12,779 --> 01:39:13,939
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Activision's fault.

1338
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:14,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

1339
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't we fire Activision out of a cannon?

1340
01:39:17,401 --> 01:39:17,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1341
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:19,261
[SPEAKER_02]: None of cannons.

1342
01:39:19,922 --> 01:39:20,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it blend?

1343
01:39:22,065 --> 01:39:22,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it will blend.

1344
01:39:22,805 --> 01:39:27,328
[SPEAKER_07]: It will blend because the blending blades are made of the hairs from Chuck Norris' legs.

1345
01:39:28,769 --> 01:39:29,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1346
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:31,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Baron's chat has leaked into Orange Lounge Radio.

1347
01:39:34,192 --> 01:39:38,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that that's not true because there's nothing that could cut a hair on Chuck Norris' leg.

1348
01:39:41,395 --> 01:39:41,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Die!

1349
01:39:42,416 --> 01:39:44,477
[SPEAKER_07]: But he can make them out himself and market them.

1350
01:39:45,618 --> 01:39:45,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

1351
01:39:46,923 --> 01:39:47,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1352
01:40:06,092 --> 01:40:06,412
[SPEAKER_05]: VIRTUA COP

1353
01:40:28,641 --> 01:40:30,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was in an interview with Cube3.

1354
01:40:30,362 --> 01:40:32,923
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the producer, Neil McEwan.

1355
01:40:33,483 --> 01:40:37,724
[SPEAKER_05]: He said they would love to do Virtua Cop or another light gun game for Sega.

1356
01:40:38,684 --> 01:40:40,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there you go.

1357
01:40:40,945 --> 01:40:50,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, the whole House of the Dead thing came to be when they were meeting with Sega about possibly doing a game in one of their franchises, and House of the Dead is what was settled on.

1358
01:40:50,529 --> 01:40:57,231
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if they continue, and you know this game does well, and they decide they want to do another game, could Virtua Cop be a possibility?

1359
01:40:58,510 --> 01:40:58,970
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1360
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:02,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how y'all feel about that, but it could be interesting.

1361
01:41:03,453 --> 01:41:03,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

1362
01:41:06,535 --> 01:41:11,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I gotta... Yeah, and GameGuru in chat says, Sega, let them do Virtua Cop.

1363
01:41:12,099 --> 01:41:13,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadowchari says, yes!

1364
01:41:14,801 --> 01:41:16,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Virtua Cop would actually be pretty fun.

1365
01:41:16,662 --> 01:41:18,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a lot of fun playing it when it was new.

1366
01:41:20,203 --> 01:41:20,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1367
01:41:21,384 --> 01:41:26,386
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole Virtua series, they should just rename Virtua Fighter to, oh look, another 3D fighter.

1368
01:41:26,946 --> 01:41:29,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Virtua Cop 2, look, another gun game.

1369
01:41:30,047 --> 01:41:30,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like that.

1370
01:41:30,787 --> 01:41:31,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1371
01:41:32,808 --> 01:41:37,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's something wonderful that came out to Club Nintendo members in Japan.

1372
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:39,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It was special.

1373
01:41:40,451 --> 01:41:47,714
[SPEAKER_07]: They could get a Wii controller that looked like an SNES pad, and now you can get one too for $75, courtesy of PlayAsia.

1374
01:41:50,353 --> 01:41:55,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, it looks just like a real SNES pad.

1375
01:41:58,357 --> 01:42:00,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it's really a Wii Classic controller.

1376
01:42:02,119 --> 01:42:02,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the fuck.

1377
01:42:04,281 --> 01:42:05,461
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'll probably get one.

1378
01:42:05,721 --> 01:42:06,622
[SPEAKER_05]: The real deal.

1379
01:42:07,902 --> 01:42:09,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I'll just probably break out my paint.

1380
01:42:11,544 --> 01:42:12,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, it does look pretty cool, though.

1381
01:42:12,865 --> 01:42:16,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's kind of expensive.

1382
01:42:17,608 --> 01:42:18,088
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1383
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:19,769
[SPEAKER_07]: You could totally either rewire...

1384
01:42:21,519 --> 01:42:32,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you anything, because keep in mind, the classic controller actually is in the shape of the Super Famicom controller, which was slightly different shape than our Super Nintendo controller, as you'll recall, right?

1385
01:42:33,224 --> 01:42:40,948
[SPEAKER_07]: You can, though, get Super Famicom controllers at, like, eBay, anywhere, really, and probably just reshell it.

1386
01:42:41,068 --> 01:42:42,569
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's not hard at all.

1387
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:44,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd do it.

1388
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:45,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a cheap bitch.

1389
01:42:46,491 --> 01:42:47,411
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1390
01:42:49,358 --> 01:42:49,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1391
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:54,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of over the whole Wii Virtual Console stuff until they put something really good on there.

1392
01:42:55,509 --> 01:42:58,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really need this controller.

1393
01:42:59,356 --> 01:42:59,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1394
01:43:01,587 --> 01:43:05,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely don't need this controller because I don't play virtual console games anymore.

1395
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:05,970
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't.

1396
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, which is too bad.

1397
01:43:09,573 --> 01:43:14,116
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some other retro games that might be interesting, including some fictional ones.

1398
01:43:14,917 --> 01:43:26,386
[SPEAKER_02]: D3, the publisher behind the new parody game Eat Lead the Return of Matt Hazard, is actually planning on releasing some of these retro parodies on Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.

1399
01:43:27,206 --> 01:43:54,233
[SPEAKER_02]: um supposed to be coming out this summer at some point no word on exactly what it is but it'll probably one of the in joke um games that are going to be you know part of this game itself I thought I heard a rumor though that there was going to be some of those games unlockable in you know eat lead so I don't really know what they're going to be doing there but I don't know that'd be kind of neat if they're good but otherwise you know if the you know I think also it kind of

1400
01:43:55,416 --> 01:44:00,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully Eat Lead does well, because otherwise you're going to have some spin-off of a game that sucked.

1401
01:44:00,979 --> 01:44:02,019
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to really want to play it.

1402
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

1403
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:07,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know much about this series, but I'm assuming this chat comment is in reference to this.

1404
01:44:08,022 --> 01:44:10,583
[SPEAKER_05]: GameGuru says, Has Matt Karts will be interesting.

1405
01:44:11,184 --> 01:44:11,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1406
01:44:13,004 --> 01:44:14,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a fictional game series.

1407
01:44:15,105 --> 01:44:15,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1408
01:44:16,403 --> 01:44:21,227
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, speaking of, like, fictional games and stuff, what is that retro game that came out on DS this week that sounds really interesting?

1409
01:44:21,267 --> 01:44:23,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Or last week, I think it was, the Retro Game Collection or something like that?

1410
01:44:23,569 --> 01:44:25,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Retro Game Challenge, the Game Center CX.

1411
01:44:25,531 --> 01:44:27,012
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds kind of funny.

1412
01:44:27,572 --> 01:44:28,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to check that game out.

1413
01:44:28,513 --> 01:44:36,300
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the sequel just came out in Japan, too, and it's actually one of the retro games, and it's actually like a 16-bit game now, which is supposed to be a big deal.

1414
01:44:37,060 --> 01:44:37,461
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

1415
01:44:38,246 --> 01:44:39,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

1416
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:41,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that they had old magazines and stuff in there.

1417
01:44:42,028 --> 01:44:42,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all made up.

1418
01:44:42,849 --> 01:44:43,830
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one.

1419
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:48,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what it was called now, but it was that PSP game, the one that you play 30 seconds at a time.

1420
01:44:49,013 --> 01:44:49,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a video on that.

1421
01:44:50,154 --> 01:44:50,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1422
01:44:50,874 --> 01:44:52,055
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks awesome.

1423
01:44:52,135 --> 01:44:53,936
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cheesy.

1424
01:44:54,236 --> 01:44:55,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the name of it.

1425
01:44:55,937 --> 01:44:57,038
[SPEAKER_05]: We covered it in a previous show.

1426
01:44:57,058 --> 01:44:58,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember talking about that, though.

1427
01:45:00,541 --> 01:45:14,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Musha30 looks awesome looking forward to checking that out you had to go to towns and stuff like that and you really had 30 seconds in between each thing but you can get more time if you visit certain people

1428
01:45:14,804 --> 01:45:36,896
[SPEAKER_05]: and AcidicVampire in chat says retro game challenge is really good I just got it this past week this is why I like having a live chat room during the show you know not a lot of podcasts can do this there's some out there you know some of the others that are on all games but not a lot of podcasts can do this kind of interacting and get answers live when we're stumped like I don't remember the name of that game somebody usually knows it or we get instant game reviews on these games we haven't we're too poor to check out so

1429
01:45:38,350 --> 01:45:38,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Quake 3 Quake 3

1430
01:45:53,739 --> 01:45:59,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is Quake 3, yes, but Quake Live is apparently going to start the open beta this next week.

1431
01:46:00,261 --> 01:46:06,423
[SPEAKER_05]: All the statistics that are on the server now, they're going to be kicked out from the closed beta.

1432
01:46:07,103 --> 01:46:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday, February 24th is apparently when the open beta testing period is going to be announced.

1433
01:46:12,685 --> 01:46:15,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Quake Live, again, is a web-based version of Quake.

1434
01:46:17,616 --> 01:46:19,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they're going to change some things.

1435
01:46:19,657 --> 01:46:21,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's just a port of the game.

1436
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:29,883
[SPEAKER_05]: All you have to do if you want to check this out, just go to www.quakelive.com on February 24th and check it out.

1437
01:46:30,123 --> 01:46:31,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll be there playing.

1438
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:33,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon Trail

1439
01:47:00,851 --> 01:47:02,892
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1440
01:47:30,187 --> 01:47:31,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can die of dysentery!

1441
01:47:31,788 --> 01:47:34,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I was going to say, now I can ford the river wherever I go.

1442
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:35,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be awesome.

1443
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1444
01:47:37,391 --> 01:47:37,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1445
01:47:37,931 --> 01:47:39,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what UnfoldedRaptor in our chatroom says.

1446
01:47:39,712 --> 01:47:40,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Dysentery on the go.

1447
01:47:42,753 --> 01:47:50,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in our chatroom, I don't even know if I should say the name, because they were in the NDA beta, says, everybody play it, the Quake Live.

1448
01:47:51,578 --> 01:47:53,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So, apparently it's really good.

1449
01:47:55,174 --> 01:47:57,236
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm hearing a lot of endorsements for it.

1450
01:47:57,917 --> 01:47:58,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1451
01:47:59,378 --> 01:48:00,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1452
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:01,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple more stories.

1453
01:48:01,901 --> 01:48:06,486
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to open up our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1454
01:48:06,506 --> 01:48:07,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be opening that very soon.

1455
01:48:07,707 --> 01:48:09,829
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got a couple quick more stories for you guys.

1456
01:48:09,869 --> 01:48:13,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of beta testing, Sony is looking for some new game testers as well.

1457
01:48:14,695 --> 01:48:16,136
[SPEAKER_02]: What will you be possibly playing?

1458
01:48:16,376 --> 01:48:17,758
[SPEAKER_02]: A new game machine.

1459
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:28,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, people are thinking that it's going to be either part of the PlayStation Portable Series or possibly maybe even like a PlayStation Phone or something like that.

1460
01:48:29,897 --> 01:48:31,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be possibly the PlayStation 4?

1461
01:48:31,718 --> 01:48:37,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking a little early for that, but I can see maybe like the PSP 4000 or something.

1462
01:48:37,161 --> 01:48:39,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be a new enhancement to PlayStation 3?

1463
01:48:39,602 --> 01:48:46,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be like a new home, I don't know, like a home type thing, like an expansion that all PlayStation users will have?

1464
01:48:46,146 --> 01:48:46,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1465
01:48:47,628 --> 01:48:48,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a possibility?

1466
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:49,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this like hardware?

1467
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:50,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hardware.

1468
01:48:51,051 --> 01:48:51,732
[SPEAKER_02]: New game machine.

1469
01:48:51,952 --> 01:48:52,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1470
01:48:52,552 --> 01:48:53,553
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably PSP version 2.

1471
01:48:53,593 --> 01:48:55,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're looking for someone.

1472
01:48:55,975 --> 01:48:59,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a job listing on Sony Computer Entertainment Japan's website.

1473
01:49:00,199 --> 01:49:04,543
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it's asking for someone to evaluate and assess a new game's machine.

1474
01:49:05,644 --> 01:49:08,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Ponzi in our chatroom suggests it will be the PS2.5.

1475
01:49:08,927 --> 01:49:11,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it be yet another reiteration of the PlayStation 2, you think?

1476
01:49:12,069 --> 01:49:12,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1477
01:49:12,469 --> 01:49:14,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not the PS2.

1478
01:49:14,691 --> 01:49:19,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a new PSP, kind of like DSi that's enhanced but plays the old stuff.

1479
01:49:19,275 --> 01:49:20,456
[SPEAKER_02]: They just had a new PSP.

1480
01:49:20,976 --> 01:49:24,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm talking about when it actually redesigns the PSP.

1481
01:49:24,378 --> 01:49:25,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a PSP Part 2.

1482
01:49:25,779 --> 01:49:28,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like something that, oh look, now it has a microphone on it.

1483
01:49:28,621 --> 01:49:29,301
[SPEAKER_02]: That's retarded.

1484
01:49:29,461 --> 01:49:31,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, oh look, now it's a little bit slimmer.

1485
01:49:31,583 --> 01:49:35,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about something that actually, oh look, it's another analog stick.

1486
01:49:35,785 --> 01:49:39,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, now the screen's bigger and shinier.

1487
01:49:40,068 --> 01:49:40,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1488
01:49:40,849 --> 01:49:42,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I can make phone calls with it.

1489
01:49:43,631 --> 01:49:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1490
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:48,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually liked that game that I played on the Gizmondo, the guitar game.

1491
01:49:48,441 --> 01:49:49,101
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty fun.

1492
01:50:12,136 --> 01:50:14,158
[SPEAKER_05]: The Johnny Whatever, was that what it was called?

1493
01:50:14,438 --> 01:50:15,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, how do I remember that?

1494
01:50:16,399 --> 01:50:23,284
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually a fun little game when I could hear it at E3 years and years ago.

1495
01:50:24,205 --> 01:50:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the wonderful downsides to E3.

1496
01:50:26,627 --> 01:50:30,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Acidic Vampire says he wants the PSP to make dinner and bring a beer.

1497
01:50:32,431 --> 01:50:32,651
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1498
01:50:34,352 --> 01:50:34,733
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1499
01:50:35,253 --> 01:50:37,815
[SPEAKER_07]: GameGuru, you were like, do you have an iPhone?

1500
01:50:39,559 --> 01:50:42,724
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have an iPhone, you're allowed to make that assessment.

1501
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:46,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It said the iPhone is a lousy gaming device.

1502
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:51,942
[SPEAKER_07]: You're allowed to make that assessment if you've actually played games on one for a significant amount of time.

1503
01:50:53,277 --> 01:50:54,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let me move on.

1504
01:50:54,397 --> 01:50:56,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one more story, then we'll open up the Skype line.

1505
01:50:56,738 --> 01:50:57,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll call in, who knows.

1506
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:01,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Hideo Kojima is going to get another Lifetime Achievement Award.

1507
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:10,643
[SPEAKER_05]: He's only 45 years old, by the way, but he has met his Lifetime Achievement from the Game Developers Choice Awards, which are happening on March 25th.

1508
01:51:11,424 --> 01:51:14,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So Hideo Kojima is going to be getting that award.

1509
01:51:14,965 --> 01:51:16,845
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because he kind of made Metal Gear and all.

1510
01:51:17,146 --> 01:51:20,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Kind of makes sense that...

1511
01:51:21,431 --> 01:51:22,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1512
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:38,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1513
01:52:05,225 --> 01:52:06,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, random story.

1514
01:52:06,846 --> 01:52:12,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's take your random calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1515
01:52:12,271 --> 01:52:15,233
[SPEAKER_05]: The Skype line is now open and we'll get to those calls momentarily.

1516
01:52:15,253 --> 01:52:20,698
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little gap between when we say something live and when they actually go out over the radio.

1517
01:52:21,018 --> 01:52:22,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nope, we're getting a call already.

1518
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:25,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll take this call and then we'll get some last minute stories.

1519
01:52:26,343 --> 01:52:27,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1520
01:52:27,344 --> 01:52:27,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1521
01:52:28,665 --> 01:52:29,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Deathwishing.

1522
01:52:29,425 --> 01:52:30,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Deathwishing.

1523
01:52:30,426 --> 01:52:30,906
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1524
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:35,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 4 It was a Street Fighter cabinet, that's all I know

1525
01:53:01,305 --> 01:53:01,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's homo What?

1526
01:53:01,645 --> 01:53:03,587
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can kick somebody's ass with Dan, then you are awesome

1527
01:53:31,958 --> 01:53:33,519
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1528
01:53:51,772 --> 01:53:54,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the AI in the game is ruthless, though.

1529
01:53:54,617 --> 01:53:55,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Holy crap.

1530
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:57,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Seth, my god.

1531
01:53:57,783 --> 01:54:00,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we were talking about how Seth is a bastard.

1532
01:54:00,628 --> 01:54:03,453
[SPEAKER_14]: All I know is just don't use the 360 controller for it.

1533
01:54:04,074 --> 01:54:04,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to use that.

1534
01:54:05,507 --> 01:54:06,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

1535
01:54:06,248 --> 01:54:17,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost got it on PlayStation 3 based on the controller alone, but then I realized I think I know maybe two or three people playing it on PlayStation 3, and I know far more on the 360, so I finally caved and got 360.

1536
01:54:17,856 --> 01:54:24,682
[SPEAKER_14]: All I know is if you want to play, invest in a fight pad, because I heard those are really good, and they're like the Sega controller.

1537
01:54:24,982 --> 01:54:28,124
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the tournament edition stick is super accurate.

1538
01:54:28,364 --> 01:54:30,226
[SPEAKER_14]: You can just pull off the same move over and over.

1539
01:54:31,667 --> 01:54:33,108
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1540
01:54:58,092 --> 01:54:58,672
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

1541
01:54:58,732 --> 01:55:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard some reports coming in from plenty of those around the country.

1542
01:55:03,055 --> 01:55:03,536
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you do?

1543
01:55:05,037 --> 01:55:10,120
[SPEAKER_14]: One beat five people, then got beat by a guy who's ranked three in California.

1544
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:10,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

1545
01:55:11,201 --> 01:55:15,224
[SPEAKER_05]: But you've not played the game since you were like five, yet you did that well in the tournament?

1546
01:55:15,244 --> 01:55:20,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I chose a place to go to that I knew people would walk in to be like, oh, look, a tournament.

1547
01:55:22,068 --> 01:55:23,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, like at the mall or something?

1548
01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:24,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1549
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:25,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that makes sense.

1550
01:55:25,871 --> 01:55:26,371
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

1551
01:55:26,872 --> 01:55:27,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1552
01:55:27,052 --> 01:55:27,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1553
01:55:28,197 --> 01:55:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Deathwishing Killzone 2 JTV

1554
01:55:58,048 --> 01:56:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get those demo codes, though, right?

1555
01:56:00,110 --> 01:56:01,351
[SPEAKER_05]: But only if you, what, pre-ordered it?

1556
01:56:01,731 --> 01:56:04,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if you pre-ordered the game, you could have got the multiplayer demo or something.

1557
01:56:05,014 --> 01:56:08,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's just the normal demo, actually.

1558
01:56:08,397 --> 01:56:11,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I saw some people giving away codes on Twitter for it, so I know it must have been kind of hard to get.

1559
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:13,320
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not hard to get.

1560
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:15,282
[SPEAKER_05]: You just create a European account and done.

1561
01:56:16,763 --> 01:56:18,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it on my PS3 right now.

1562
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:19,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Sneaky, sneaky.

1563
01:56:20,666 --> 01:56:21,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, British people.

1564
01:56:22,007 --> 01:56:25,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then maybe we need to fire up Killzone and compete with the other channel.

1565
01:56:25,828 --> 01:56:27,609
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have no idea who else is showing it.

1566
01:56:28,669 --> 01:56:30,430
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hot-blooded gaming or something.

1567
01:56:31,850 --> 01:56:32,270
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so interesting.

1568
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:36,612
[SPEAKER_05]: When we first started on Justin.TV, there really was not a lot of gaming stuff on there at all.

1569
01:56:37,372 --> 01:56:40,773
[SPEAKER_05]: But now there's tons of people just kind of showing what they play on there.

1570
01:56:41,413 --> 01:56:42,673
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, props to them.

1571
01:56:43,434 --> 01:56:45,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely expanded the community over there on Justin.TV.

1572
01:56:45,734 --> 01:56:48,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

1573
01:56:48,095 --> 01:56:48,815
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks for the call, buddy.

1574
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:49,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright?

1575
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:49,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, thanks.

1576
01:56:49,896 --> 01:56:50,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

1577
01:56:50,256 --> 01:56:50,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good day.

1578
01:56:52,297 --> 01:57:00,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1579
01:57:00,783 --> 01:57:05,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Actdeft, how are you doing?

1580
01:57:08,109 --> 01:57:17,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, awesome, we have a little bit of lag probably because of the fact that you are in another country So why don't you go ahead and ask us your question or whatever you called in about tonight

1581
01:57:20,143 --> 01:57:31,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I basically wanted to talk about Street Fighter 4 here in Mexico because something pretty bad happened, especially with the collector's edition for PlayStation 3.

1582
01:57:32,893 --> 01:57:33,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, tell us about it.

1583
01:57:33,774 --> 01:57:35,415
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty big shortage.

1584
01:57:37,537 --> 01:57:38,197
[SPEAKER_05]: How did it happen?

1585
01:57:38,237 --> 01:57:39,198
[SPEAKER_05]: How did the shortage happen?

1586
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:41,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Well...

1587
01:57:43,436 --> 01:57:45,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows how it happened.

1588
01:57:45,117 --> 01:57:45,978
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happened.

1589
01:57:46,879 --> 01:57:58,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, most of the stores that had pre-orders for the Street Fighter 4 version on the PS3, the first edition one, basically got cut off by Capcom.

1590
01:57:59,808 --> 01:58:07,033
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't get sent all the pre-orders they had in stock or they had planned to sell.

1591
01:58:09,042 --> 01:58:09,802
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so strange.

1592
01:58:09,902 --> 01:58:13,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they redirected to the US to maybe meet demand?

1593
01:58:13,543 --> 01:58:17,104
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like, well, we could screw over other countries if we meet the demand here.

1594
01:58:17,124 --> 01:58:18,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems a little odd.

1595
01:58:21,104 --> 01:58:22,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most people are thinking that.

1596
01:58:23,165 --> 01:58:27,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much it because it got sold out in the US.

1597
01:58:29,706 --> 01:58:31,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw Mexico, possibly.

1598
01:58:32,006 --> 01:58:34,587
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry for the PS3 owners that

1599
01:58:35,331 --> 01:58:37,912
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm correct, I'm pretty sure it's around

1600
01:59:06,163 --> 01:59:11,865
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,500 pesos for the collector's edition and 1,000 for the regular edition.

1601
01:59:12,625 --> 01:59:24,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Though most people on the, not to call it the black market, but on the maybe what we call here at the Angles,

1602
01:59:24,898 --> 01:59:28,621
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a flea market or a swap meet.

1603
01:59:29,361 --> 01:59:32,844
[SPEAKER_00]: They could sell it for over 2,000 pesos.

1604
01:59:32,884 --> 01:59:37,948
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be like around $150 on the US.

1605
01:59:38,448 --> 01:59:38,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, yeah.

1606
01:59:38,929 --> 01:59:40,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking at conversion rates right now.

1607
01:59:42,271 --> 01:59:45,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about 10.8 pesos to the dollar.

1608
01:59:45,614 --> 01:59:46,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.

1609
01:59:46,074 --> 01:59:48,356
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it would be about 1,500 to get it legitimately.

1610
01:59:48,436 --> 01:59:49,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Divide that by 10.8598.

1611
01:59:49,157 --> 01:59:49,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually 1,450.

1612
01:59:54,983 --> 01:59:56,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's like $138 or $130.

1613
01:59:56,565 --> 01:59:56,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1614
01:59:57,046 --> 01:59:58,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1615
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:04,835
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes we're a little spoiled here, so we have to remember that.

1616
02:00:04,895 --> 02:00:08,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, maybe next time you need to get some friends in the U.S.

1617
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:12,525
[SPEAKER_05]: and just mail you the game or something, you probably get it faster and cheaper.

1618
02:00:13,546 --> 02:00:13,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1619
02:00:14,551 --> 02:00:15,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most possibly.

1620
02:00:16,533 --> 02:00:20,936
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing that I got the 360 version over at Amazon.

1621
02:00:22,217 --> 02:00:23,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to worry about it.

1622
02:00:23,658 --> 02:00:28,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of curiosity, I don't know if you know the answer to this or not, but are you able to order games from the U.S.?

1623
02:00:28,422 --> 02:00:31,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, say, you can order a game from Amazon.com in the U.S.

1624
02:00:31,144 --> 02:00:33,126
[SPEAKER_05]: and have it shipped to Mexico, or do they not do that?

1625
02:00:36,048 --> 02:00:38,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I'm getting some help from my friend.

1626
02:00:40,032 --> 02:00:42,293
[SPEAKER_00]: The game is going to be delivered over the U.S.,

1627
02:00:43,726 --> 02:00:45,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty much next to the border.

1628
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,852
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go and pick it up.

1629
02:00:48,313 --> 02:00:51,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I just paid with my Mexican credit card.

1630
02:00:51,077 --> 02:00:51,938
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can do.

1631
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,984
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cannot ship games over here.

1632
02:00:56,947 --> 02:01:00,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get movies and I think books, but everything else, no.

1633
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:06,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually like that for Amazon UK.

1634
02:01:06,293 --> 02:01:14,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I can order books and they'll ship here, but I can't order a game or a toy from the UK.

1635
02:01:14,358 --> 02:01:15,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to ship it to a UK address.

1636
02:01:16,359 --> 02:01:18,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, plus you'd get into region issues at that point, right?

1637
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even though we got screwed on the pre-S3 version of the collector's edition of Street Fighter 4,

1638
02:01:44,861 --> 02:01:52,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the rest of the world, Mexico, Japan, and Europe got the 360 ring controller, that it has a definitely better D-pad.

1639
02:01:52,402 --> 02:01:55,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two controllers here with me, and they definitely work.

1640
02:01:56,063 --> 02:02:06,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the same controller as the white one that comes with the console, though the D-pad, you see it, and it's the same, but you feel it, and it's definitely better.

1641
02:02:07,225 --> 02:02:08,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope they think about it.

1642
02:02:08,925 --> 02:02:12,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Street Fighter Turbo with it, and it's definitely better.

1643
02:02:12,717 --> 02:02:13,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

1644
02:02:33,655 --> 02:02:35,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, we'll take another one.

1645
02:02:35,777 --> 02:02:38,819
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1646
02:02:38,899 --> 02:02:40,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But wait, we already have a call dropped in.

1647
02:02:40,601 --> 02:02:41,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1648
02:02:41,702 --> 02:02:42,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1649
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:45,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kind of exhausted Jason.

1650
02:02:46,145 --> 02:02:50,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, am I exhausting you from all my needy tells about the podcast feed?

1651
02:02:50,549 --> 02:02:51,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't understand.

1652
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:52,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I followed Deep Man's instructions.

1653
02:02:52,891 --> 02:02:53,932
[SPEAKER_05]: That just put it on the website.

1654
02:02:53,952 --> 02:02:54,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't put it on the feed.

1655
02:02:55,053 --> 02:02:55,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Help me, Jason.

1656
02:02:55,693 --> 02:02:56,054
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

1657
02:02:56,154 --> 02:02:57,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually kind of weird.

1658
02:02:57,154 --> 02:02:58,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't... It's...

1659
02:02:59,176 --> 02:02:59,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1660
02:02:59,616 --> 02:03:01,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it disappeared from the website.

1661
02:03:01,158 --> 02:03:01,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1662
02:03:01,498 --> 02:03:02,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to talk to Deke Man about it.

1663
02:03:02,939 --> 02:03:03,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1664
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:04,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm confused.

1665
02:03:05,061 --> 02:03:07,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have one more episode to get us all caught up.

1666
02:03:07,082 --> 02:03:08,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to try and get tonight's episode up.

1667
02:03:09,464 --> 02:03:10,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it will realistically happen tomorrow.

1668
02:03:10,885 --> 02:03:12,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow is my mother's birthday.

1669
02:03:12,646 --> 02:03:15,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to go out and spend some time with her.

1670
02:03:16,549 --> 02:03:19,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, if I am not mistaking, this is 68.

1671
02:03:20,672 --> 02:03:21,453
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother is going to be.

1672
02:03:21,573 --> 02:03:22,334
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yep.

1673
02:03:23,214 --> 02:03:23,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, sorry.

1674
02:03:24,475 --> 02:03:25,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that everybody cares.

1675
02:03:25,596 --> 02:03:27,518
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, Jason, what did you call in to talk about tonight?

1676
02:03:27,538 --> 02:03:27,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on the phone.

1677
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:35,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say that your parents are old, but at the same time, you are also older than me by a fair margin.

1678
02:03:36,646 --> 02:03:37,606
[SPEAKER_05]: But my parents had me late.

1679
02:03:37,626 --> 02:03:38,567
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom had me when she was 38.

1680
02:03:39,087 --> 02:03:39,968
[SPEAKER_05]: No, wait, that wouldn't make sense.

1681
02:03:39,988 --> 02:03:40,628
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd have to be turning 69.

1682
02:03:42,289 --> 02:03:43,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I'm a bad kid.

1683
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:46,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know how old my mom is, but it all starts to blend together after 65.

1684
02:03:47,773 --> 02:03:49,874
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I guess she's going to be 69, actually.

1685
02:03:51,915 --> 02:03:52,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, what did you call in about?

1686
02:03:52,916 --> 02:03:54,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely you didn't call in to talk about my mom.

1687
02:03:55,616 --> 02:03:56,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1688
02:03:56,296 --> 02:03:58,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1689
02:03:59,998 --> 02:04:08,980
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tony Hawk story is kind of interesting because the only thing that comes to mind, there's only two things that come to mind when they talk about a custom controller.

1690
02:04:09,401 --> 02:04:19,384
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is the arcade cabinet, the skateboard that Topskater had in the entire arcade cabinet set up.

1691
02:04:20,376 --> 02:04:30,222
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the only other thing that comes to mind is that since we have wireless controllers now, something resembling like those tech decks that were really popular between 5 and 10 years ago.

1692
02:04:32,283 --> 02:04:34,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I haven't heard about a tech deck in a long time.

1693
02:04:35,065 --> 02:04:36,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, exactly.

1694
02:04:36,946 --> 02:04:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just kind of... I'm trying to envision myself... First of all, I sucked with those things.

1695
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:45,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't do anything on those stupid things.

1696
02:04:46,392 --> 02:04:48,093
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's...

1697
02:04:49,824 --> 02:04:50,304
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1698
02:05:14,747 --> 02:05:43,252
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think the angle might make a difference too or something like that or the way that you shift the skateboard on its mount but it's just it sounds so stupid to me because we have a controller that works for this stuff already it's the same thing that I said with Home on the PS3 we have an interface we have a system that works you come up with a stupid gimmick like this and it's going to artificially inflate the cost and be stupid this game is on the Wii right?

1699
02:05:44,212 --> 02:05:44,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, PS3 and 360.

1700
02:05:45,013 --> 02:05:45,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1701
02:05:45,294 --> 02:05:50,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, because if it's not the Wii, it's another... There used to be stupid gimmicks over there.

1702
02:05:52,244 --> 02:05:52,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1703
02:05:54,975 --> 02:05:56,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really weird to think about.

1704
02:05:57,156 --> 02:06:04,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the unfortunate downside to Guitar Hero and Rock Band being very popular, and the Wii.

1705
02:06:04,297 --> 02:06:15,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, all three of those things getting popular roughly around all the same time has put this stigma out there that, wow, all these extra peripherals can sell like crazy!

1706
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:18,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1707
02:06:18,542 --> 02:06:25,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that the power pad is ever really something to legitimize at all, but rather the power glove.

1708
02:06:26,971 --> 02:06:30,655
[SPEAKER_03]: The power glove, the track and field mat, the...

1709
02:06:31,876 --> 02:06:36,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever that Sega Genesis controller, Beam, Octagon... Activator.

1710
02:06:37,139 --> 02:06:38,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't it the Activator?

1711
02:06:38,799 --> 02:06:39,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1712
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:40,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I had an Activator.

1713
02:06:41,060 --> 02:06:42,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, they were awesome.

1714
02:06:42,321 --> 02:06:44,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say, though, about the Power Pad.

1715
02:06:44,562 --> 02:06:47,463
[SPEAKER_05]: The Power Pad was badass when I was a kid.

1716
02:06:47,543 --> 02:06:48,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was probably like...

1717
02:06:49,544 --> 02:06:53,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little older than the rest of you, and I was probably like 9 or 10 when the Power Pad first came out.

1718
02:06:54,305 --> 02:06:57,446
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have a blast playing frickin' track meet.

1719
02:06:58,967 --> 02:07:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first off, I remember for the long jump, the trick was you jump off the pad and then jump back on so you can fly just like so far.

1720
02:07:07,169 --> 02:07:10,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But also the other thing would be short order and eggsplode.

1721
02:07:11,610 --> 02:07:12,670
[SPEAKER_05]: A game was awesome.

1722
02:07:13,571 --> 02:07:15,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never heard of that.

1723
02:07:36,078 --> 02:07:36,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1724
02:07:56,761 --> 02:08:01,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually kind of glad to see somebody talking about Prop Cycle.

1725
02:08:02,023 --> 02:08:06,525
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a big, expensive rig, but that was a really good game.

1726
02:08:06,545 --> 02:08:08,006
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Prop Cycle so much.

1727
02:08:08,046 --> 02:08:09,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Prop Cycle gets props.

1728
02:08:11,167 --> 02:08:11,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Look online.

1729
02:08:11,808 --> 02:08:14,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever see the Prop Cycle that hooked up to an Addams Family pinball?

1730
02:08:17,045 --> 02:08:18,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.

1731
02:08:18,206 --> 02:08:18,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look it up.

1732
02:08:18,846 --> 02:08:20,648
[SPEAKER_05]: What a pointless fucking combination.

1733
02:08:21,848 --> 02:08:23,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It's brilliant and stupid at the same time.

1734
02:08:24,170 --> 02:08:25,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Just look it up.

1735
02:08:26,672 --> 02:08:28,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll find a link and put it in the chat room.

1736
02:08:28,713 --> 02:08:29,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good to me.

1737
02:08:31,095 --> 02:08:38,320
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, we need more content on the website and I'm thinking one thing you ought to do is a brilliant but stupid column and that should be something that you put in there.

1738
02:08:38,701 --> 02:08:39,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in gaming.

1739
02:08:39,481 --> 02:08:40,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Brilliant but stupid.

1740
02:08:42,703 --> 02:08:43,084
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1741
02:08:44,044 --> 02:08:45,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, any other quick thoughts before we let you go, buddy?

1742
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:51,392
[SPEAKER_03]: The GTA 4 Lost in the Damned controversy you guys were talking about before.

1743
02:08:51,872 --> 02:08:54,053
[SPEAKER_03]: The debate, I am so tired of it in general.

1744
02:08:54,673 --> 02:08:58,214
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they did it just to see what would happen.

1745
02:08:58,654 --> 02:09:01,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you do, because they don't make every layer.

1746
02:09:02,215 --> 02:09:05,096
[SPEAKER_03]: If you make a person, the texture is closed.

1747
02:09:05,557 --> 02:09:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the other thing, and I should have brought this up earlier in the show, because who knows how many people have actually listened this far two and a half hours into the show.

1748
02:09:11,719 --> 02:09:12,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

1749
02:09:13,795 --> 02:09:18,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet they did it this way because the peen isn't really on the disc.

1750
02:09:18,558 --> 02:09:19,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in the game.

1751
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:22,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the download content.

1752
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:33,428
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like the reverse of Hot Coffee where you had to hack the disc or whatever, basically use the little code to unlock the sex scene.

1753
02:09:34,248 --> 02:09:36,129
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the complete reverse of that.

1754
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:40,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like they almost did this just like they knew This is the finger.

1755
02:09:40,652 --> 02:09:43,014
[SPEAKER_05]: They knew in the beginning they wanted to put

1756
02:09:44,403 --> 02:10:00,335
[SPEAKER_05]: the um peeing in the game but they thought no let's do it in the download content because then people who get mad and want to take this game off shelves well it's not really in the game you have to consciously pay to download or whatever a little weird Jason did you see the picture

1757
02:10:02,190 --> 02:10:02,991
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't.

1758
02:10:04,132 --> 02:10:06,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I tend to stop clicking around and whatnot when I'm on a call.

1759
02:10:06,795 --> 02:10:10,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you go so you can go check that out and post your things in chat.

1760
02:10:11,379 --> 02:10:12,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the call as always, Jason.

1761
02:10:13,321 --> 02:10:16,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for my venting earlier when I couldn't get the podcast up.

1762
02:10:17,125 --> 02:10:22,129
[SPEAKER_05]: People sometimes forget you're a big part of this show as well, even though it may not be your voice they have to hear for three hours every Sunday.

1763
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:24,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So how the hell would you play that game?

1764
02:10:25,172 --> 02:10:25,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, take care, Jason.

1765
02:10:26,614 --> 02:10:26,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Night.

1766
02:10:28,612 --> 02:10:30,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Codemasters wants you to name your baby Jason in the UK.

1767
02:10:55,208 --> 02:10:55,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1768
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:14,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Brilliant and stupid.

1769
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:15,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Not brilliant at all.

1770
02:11:15,581 --> 02:11:16,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just stupid.

1771
02:11:16,321 --> 02:11:17,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just stupid.

1772
02:11:18,042 --> 02:11:24,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you name your kid Jason for other reasons, you know, you have a grandpa named Jason or you just like the name.

1773
02:11:24,504 --> 02:11:25,084
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

1774
02:11:25,164 --> 02:11:26,725
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you name it Jason because of this.

1775
02:11:26,745 --> 02:11:27,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Do it for Friday the 13th.

1776
02:11:28,505 --> 02:11:28,746
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1777
02:11:28,986 --> 02:11:30,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we got another call on the line.

1778
02:11:30,146 --> 02:11:30,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to keep them waiting.

1779
02:11:31,226 --> 02:11:32,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1780
02:11:32,347 --> 02:11:32,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1781
02:11:33,427 --> 02:11:34,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Yo, what up, guys?

1782
02:11:34,148 --> 02:11:35,388
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Xenocore from the Ultimate Quest.

1783
02:11:35,428 --> 02:11:35,868
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing?

1784
02:11:35,928 --> 02:11:36,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Xenocore, how you doing?

1785
02:11:36,728 --> 02:11:37,649
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't heard from you in a while.

1786
02:11:37,689 --> 02:11:39,149
[SPEAKER_05]: How are things going at Ultimate Quest?

1787
02:11:39,169 --> 02:11:40,490
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't heard from Footy in a while either.

1788
02:11:41,365 --> 02:11:44,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, lots of real world stuff is kind of hitting us all at the moment.

1789
02:11:45,227 --> 02:11:47,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I moved and got a new job.

1790
02:11:47,068 --> 02:11:48,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Foodie's in the middle of finals.

1791
02:11:48,328 --> 02:11:49,489
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this, that, the other thing.

1792
02:11:50,549 --> 02:11:53,670
[SPEAKER_13]: We are planning on coming back, but we've got to get our real lives in order first.

1793
02:11:53,690 --> 02:11:59,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, I think you've got Star Ocean this week, so you're going to need to get things together because that's a big RPG.

1794
02:11:59,969 --> 02:12:00,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's true.

1795
02:12:01,109 --> 02:12:01,670
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

1796
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:05,971
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've been focusing in other areas since I was cut off from the interwebs.

1797
02:12:06,011 --> 02:12:08,793
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you sort of need an internet connection to do the MMO thing.

1798
02:12:08,993 --> 02:12:09,153
[SPEAKER_13]: True.

1799
02:12:09,253 --> 02:12:17,376
[SPEAKER_13]: So I went back to some of my older conquests and dug up a copy of Falcon 4 after I heard Hendrick's mate mention it on his show the other day.

1800
02:12:18,196 --> 02:12:24,259
[SPEAKER_13]: And on top of that, the new release of 40K Dawn of War 2 just came out.

1801
02:12:25,151 --> 02:12:25,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Warhammer RTS Game

1802
02:12:44,022 --> 02:12:44,602
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1803
02:13:11,317 --> 02:13:13,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, not so much now.

1804
02:13:13,079 --> 02:13:16,242
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, things are pretty well balanced.

1805
02:13:16,322 --> 02:13:20,927
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just online you really have to pay attention to what you're doing because there is no base building in this.

1806
02:13:20,987 --> 02:13:23,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything is done by putting your troops out in the field.

1807
02:13:24,591 --> 02:13:30,198
[SPEAKER_13]: So where you position them and what areas they're looking in are a lot more important than what they used to be.

1808
02:13:30,788 --> 02:13:31,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1809
02:13:54,810 --> 02:14:03,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you look at it, the guys who built Warhammer Mythic, I mean, they're known for their PvP stuff from Dark Age of Camelot.

1810
02:14:03,913 --> 02:14:06,434
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's pretty much what this game is built towards.

1811
02:14:06,694 --> 02:14:13,917
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're not into it for the PvP, you may not want to last as long because there's only a 40-level cap.

1812
02:14:13,957 --> 02:14:17,798
[SPEAKER_13]: The endgame comes a lot sooner, mainly to get you into PvP stuff.

1813
02:14:18,219 --> 02:14:23,861
[SPEAKER_13]: So if going up against other players isn't your thing, then you're sort of going to get turned off from it after a while.

1814
02:14:25,206 --> 02:14:30,248
[SPEAKER_12]: You run out of PvE content pretty quickly, or at least so I've heard from my friends who play it.

1815
02:14:30,528 --> 02:14:30,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1816
02:14:30,948 --> 02:14:36,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing it for a little while, and it's not that I disliked the game, but at the time I was so sucked into WoW I couldn't balance two games.

1817
02:14:36,350 --> 02:14:37,051
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to cut one of those.

1818
02:14:37,071 --> 02:14:38,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, look, another public quest.

1819
02:14:38,091 --> 02:14:39,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, look, it's the same public quest.

1820
02:14:39,431 --> 02:14:39,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no.

1821
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:42,753
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I thought those public quests were actually a pretty neat idea.

1822
02:14:42,993 --> 02:14:43,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that was kind of cool.

1823
02:14:44,393 --> 02:14:45,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It had some neat ideas.

1824
02:14:46,254 --> 02:14:49,615
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I'm a little sad to hear it's bleeding out users.

1825
02:14:49,715 --> 02:14:53,857
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, at the same time, if not everybody's in it for PvP...

1826
02:14:54,778 --> 02:14:58,644
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that it's going to go away, though.

1827
02:14:58,664 --> 02:15:00,486
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's going to stay above Critical Mass.

1828
02:15:00,527 --> 02:15:09,781
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll just be one of those other ones that are just sitting quietly in the corner, like EverQuest and EverQuest 2 and Planetside and all these other classic ones that are still running.

1829
02:15:09,961 --> 02:15:11,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another game I played this week.

1830
02:15:11,282 --> 02:15:16,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't talk about my gaming week, but I actually went back and checked out Phantasy Star Universe for a little while, and you would be surprised.

1831
02:15:16,644 --> 02:15:23,546
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Xbox 360, Block 1 and Block 2 are still full a lot of the times, especially during primetime gaming hours.

1832
02:15:23,566 --> 02:15:32,169
[SPEAKER_05]: They still have... You would think that game would be completely dead, but they still have a very loyal user base in there, which was amazing because they still have Christmas decorations up.

1833
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:39,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I think they get away with it because they call it Winter something, so technically it's still Winter, but...

1834
02:15:40,791 --> 02:15:41,532
[SPEAKER_13]: One other thing.

1835
02:15:42,252 --> 02:15:49,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Did anybody in your area or anybody listening happen to get into the GameStop Street Fighter 4 competition that happened this weekend?

1836
02:15:49,875 --> 02:15:50,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not go.

1837
02:15:50,775 --> 02:15:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody in the room go?

1838
02:15:52,575 --> 02:15:53,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

1839
02:15:53,336 --> 02:15:58,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did have a caller just a little bit ago talk about his experience there in Southern California.

1840
02:15:58,718 --> 02:15:59,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But did you go?

1841
02:16:00,256 --> 02:16:02,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there was one in Jacksonville, luckily enough.

1842
02:16:03,117 --> 02:16:06,818
[SPEAKER_13]: I went in, got the round two, and I got my ass... Well, not handed to me.

1843
02:16:06,838 --> 02:16:08,319
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a 3-2 victory for him.

1844
02:16:08,619 --> 02:16:11,060
[SPEAKER_13]: But he's an old schooler like me, so I didn't feel too bad about it.

1845
02:16:11,300 --> 02:16:12,940
[SPEAKER_13]: And he actually ended up winning the store.

1846
02:16:13,281 --> 02:16:14,941
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was content with that.

1847
02:16:14,961 --> 02:16:17,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're going to lose to someone, lose to the eventual winner, I suppose.

1848
02:16:18,282 --> 02:16:19,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly, exactly.

1849
02:16:19,823 --> 02:16:20,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I felt like.

1850
02:16:20,503 --> 02:16:25,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the days of DDR, I don't know if a lot of people know, but I used to do Perfect Attack in DDR in tournaments and stuff, and

1851
02:16:26,085 --> 02:16:35,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I came in fourth, which was probably as high as I would go in some tournaments, but, you know, usually when I would lose, I would lose to the person who would eventually win, so it didn't feel so bad.

1852
02:16:36,988 --> 02:16:37,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But those were the days.

1853
02:16:37,988 --> 02:16:45,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man, I wish I could do some of that now, but now if I probably played a nine-footer on DDR, I'd be like, where's my inhaler?

1854
02:16:46,811 --> 02:16:51,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Xenocore, before we let you go?

1855
02:16:52,478 --> 02:17:01,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just that feeling of being in the tournament, everybody talking smack, all waiting for their turn and getting sent home crying.

1856
02:17:01,666 --> 02:17:02,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I miss that from the arcades.

1857
02:17:03,528 --> 02:17:04,289
[SPEAKER_13]: That needs to come back.

1858
02:17:04,389 --> 02:17:05,290
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's pretty much it.

1859
02:17:05,310 --> 02:17:06,270
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I have, guys.

1860
02:17:06,431 --> 02:17:06,811
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1861
02:17:06,871 --> 02:17:08,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they'll do some more of this.

1862
02:17:08,693 --> 02:17:09,033
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1863
02:17:09,333 --> 02:17:09,553
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1864
02:17:09,774 --> 02:17:11,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Xenogor, take care, buddy, and have a good one.

1865
02:17:11,675 --> 02:17:11,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it easy.

1866
02:17:12,016 --> 02:17:12,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And good luck with Ultimate Quest.

1867
02:17:12,996 --> 02:17:13,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Come back soon.

1868
02:17:15,171 --> 02:17:21,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're gonna go ahead and close the Skype line for now because we've taken lots and lots of calls tonight and we still have a cage match we gotta get to at some point.

1869
02:17:22,314 --> 02:17:30,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I heard one of our frequent listeners and callers, TheRobD, apparently did pretty well in this tournament.

1870
02:17:31,177 --> 02:17:33,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he won his store or runner-up or whatever.

1871
02:17:33,217 --> 02:17:34,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what are you laughing about, DarkSakura?

1872
02:17:35,066 --> 02:17:36,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the prop cycle.

1873
02:17:36,667 --> 02:17:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you nerd.

1874
02:17:39,008 --> 02:17:46,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so yeah, I was just reading about that in chat and it reminded me because I saw a live journal post of his that said that he did pretty well, so congrats to him.

1875
02:17:46,813 --> 02:17:51,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently he's got, he's like, I'm sure he's number one on my friends list and stuff online.

1876
02:17:51,096 --> 02:17:52,597
[SPEAKER_05]: He's pretty insanely good at Street Fighter.

1877
02:17:52,937 --> 02:17:55,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to play him once and lose to him just for the little factor.

1878
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:59,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, any other last minute stories you want to get to?

1879
02:18:00,185 --> 02:18:07,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's rumored that, or I guess Sony is saying God of War 3 and MAG are coming within the year.

1880
02:18:07,271 --> 02:18:14,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, MAG being that massive action game, and these will be like blockbuster exclusives.

1881
02:18:16,218 --> 02:18:21,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, no word on when they're possibly going to come, although if I were a guessing man...

1882
02:18:24,039 --> 02:18:27,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps God of War 3 might be coming out around July-ish.

1883
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:29,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't know.

1884
02:18:29,922 --> 02:18:32,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's just a guess.

1885
02:18:32,423 --> 02:18:33,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer's a good time to release games.

1886
02:18:34,744 --> 02:18:35,564
[SPEAKER_02]: July, especially.

1887
02:18:35,584 --> 02:18:40,427
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, what, NCAA football and NCAA football.

1888
02:18:41,072 --> 02:18:41,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it.

1889
02:18:42,133 --> 02:18:42,834
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for July.

1890
02:18:44,575 --> 02:18:47,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Braid, we talked about that earlier in the show.

1891
02:18:48,639 --> 02:18:52,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you thought $15 was too much for Braid, well, you're in luck.

1892
02:18:52,222 --> 02:18:56,706
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dropping the price this week to 800 Microsoft points or $10.

1893
02:18:56,927 --> 02:18:59,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Great for sales.

1894
02:18:59,949 --> 02:19:02,732
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't played it yet, you get a chance to play it now.

1895
02:19:03,332 --> 02:19:04,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a story, too.

1896
02:19:05,735 --> 02:19:07,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, DarkSakura, go ahead.

1897
02:19:08,308 --> 02:19:09,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Just jump right in there.

1898
02:19:09,089 --> 02:19:09,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut Loki off.

1899
02:19:10,470 --> 02:19:11,511
[SPEAKER_07]: He does it to me all the time.

1900
02:19:11,531 --> 02:19:12,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was fair.

1901
02:19:13,032 --> 02:19:13,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

1902
02:19:13,392 --> 02:19:14,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead with your story.

1903
02:19:14,073 --> 02:19:16,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually just trying to remind you that I had one later.

1904
02:19:17,115 --> 02:19:22,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Microsoft overpaid some layoff severances and now they want their money back.

1905
02:19:23,681 --> 02:19:24,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in...

1906
02:19:28,044 --> 02:19:43,151
[SPEAKER_02]: In an administrative error, they had meant to pay off their 1,400 employees that they had just recently laid off, but they actually had put a little bit too much money in their severance packages.

1907
02:19:44,071 --> 02:19:52,315
[SPEAKER_02]: They now want it back and says, according to this, we ask that you repay the overpayment and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience to you.

1908
02:19:52,495 --> 02:19:54,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know it's just a minor inconvenience.

1909
02:19:55,236 --> 02:19:56,557
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of messed up.

1910
02:19:56,957 --> 02:19:57,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1911
02:19:58,715 --> 02:20:00,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you know what's funny?

1912
02:20:01,497 --> 02:20:03,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had something like that happen to me once.

1913
02:20:03,279 --> 02:20:05,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say at what job, it was a long, long time ago.

1914
02:20:05,661 --> 02:20:07,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Long, long time ago, like I was younger.

1915
02:20:07,883 --> 02:20:10,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And they totally overpaid me on my last check.

1916
02:20:10,045 --> 02:20:12,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And not by much, but like a hundred bucks.

1917
02:20:12,527 --> 02:20:14,228
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're like 18, that's a lot of money.

1918
02:20:14,689 --> 02:20:19,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, thankfully they didn't ask for it back.

1919
02:20:19,073 --> 02:20:21,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Because at that age, I don't know how I would have paid that back.

1920
02:20:22,509 --> 02:20:23,951
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyhow.

1921
02:20:24,713 --> 02:20:27,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Jamie, why don't you go ahead and do your last minute story?

1922
02:20:27,697 --> 02:20:28,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little dumb story.

1923
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:29,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, go for it.

1924
02:20:29,420 --> 02:20:37,573
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually, it was not dumb because it was linked to me from Alpha Cananogram in chat that they're selling Noby Noby Boy shirts.

1925
02:20:38,453 --> 02:20:39,614
[SPEAKER_07]: at Panic.com

1926
02:21:06,806 --> 02:21:07,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me look at that right now.

1927
02:21:07,647 --> 02:21:13,190
[SPEAKER_05]: This is at panic.com slash goods slash nobynoby.php Free advertising for them.

1928
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:13,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at that.

1929
02:21:13,771 --> 02:21:14,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wow.

1930
02:21:14,271 --> 02:21:14,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

1931
02:21:15,712 --> 02:21:16,432
[SPEAKER_07]: They're hilarious.

1932
02:21:16,452 --> 02:21:18,854
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like a giant scribble on a shirt.

1933
02:21:19,254 --> 02:21:20,115
[SPEAKER_07]: They're hilarious.

1934
02:21:21,425 --> 02:21:22,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, do you have any more?

1935
02:21:43,597 --> 02:21:45,258
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it for right now.

1936
02:22:08,834 --> 02:22:11,856
[SPEAKER_05]: and it would boot Xbox Live people off of the network actually.

1937
02:22:12,696 --> 02:22:17,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft has responded saying that basically you should contact your internet provider if this is happening to you.

1938
02:22:18,079 --> 02:22:22,162
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they are threatening to ban any hacker that gets involved in it.

1939
02:22:22,702 --> 02:22:26,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, this problem is not related to the Xbox Live service but to the player's internet connection.

1940
02:22:26,784 --> 02:22:32,268
[SPEAKER_05]: The attacker could also attempt to disrupt other internet activities such as streaming video or web browsing using the same tool.

1941
02:22:32,788 --> 02:22:36,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And Microsoft just kind of wants to remind people that, hey, Xbox Live is like any other internet service.

1942
02:22:37,271 --> 02:22:47,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So if somebody is attempting to hack you in that regard, or I guess more like spam you, I think would be a more appropriate term, it could affect Xbox Live just like it would affect anything else you do on the internet.

1943
02:22:47,918 --> 02:22:48,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So be warned.

1944
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:53,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're doing that to people, unless they really deserve it, you're lame.

1945
02:22:54,366 --> 02:22:57,110
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're doing it to people just randomly, then you're lame.

1946
02:22:57,190 --> 02:23:00,194
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're doing it to people because they really deserve it, then okay.

1947
02:23:01,355 --> 02:23:02,176
[SPEAKER_04]: But just be careful.

1948
02:23:02,437 --> 02:23:04,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently they're doing it to people because they lose to them.

1949
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:06,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, see, that's lame.

1950
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:07,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Get over it.

1951
02:23:07,561 --> 02:23:08,061
[SPEAKER_04]: You've lost.

1952
02:23:08,561 --> 02:23:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like you.

1953
02:23:09,301 --> 02:23:11,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to DDoS you.

1954
02:23:11,702 --> 02:23:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: QQ some more.

1955
02:23:12,842 --> 02:23:13,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Cry me a river.

1956
02:23:14,242 --> 02:23:16,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Die in a fire if that's you.

1957
02:23:17,443 --> 02:23:18,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you playing games online?

1958
02:23:19,304 --> 02:23:22,385
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't handle losing, don't play games online.

1959
02:23:22,625 --> 02:23:23,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Why else do people play games?

1960
02:23:24,125 --> 02:23:25,185
[SPEAKER_12]: To piss other people off.

1961
02:23:25,265 --> 02:23:28,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking hope Seth, for real, comes into your house and beats you up.

1962
02:23:29,326 --> 02:23:31,207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I hope for those people.

1963
02:23:32,403 --> 02:23:39,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, if that's it for the last minute stories, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the evening and wrap up the show for tonight.

1964
02:23:39,464 --> 02:23:41,625
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get to the live afterbirth.

1965
02:23:43,285 --> 02:23:45,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew, thank you for being here tonight.

1966
02:23:45,226 --> 02:23:46,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry you didn't get to say more on the show.

1967
02:23:47,026 --> 02:23:48,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And happy Pi Day.

1968
02:23:48,466 --> 02:23:54,928
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys brought pie and we'll probably enjoy it during the afterbirth, although I don't know if we have a lot of forks, but I can't have any, but you guys can all have some.

1969
02:23:55,248 --> 02:23:58,949
[SPEAKER_05]: It is episode 314 or Pi Day, so happy Pi Day.

1970
02:24:00,069 --> 02:24:00,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew, any final thoughts?

1971
02:24:03,686 --> 02:24:06,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Kim, thank you for being here and I hope you feel better.

1972
02:24:06,429 --> 02:24:08,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Take drugs.

1973
02:24:08,851 --> 02:24:09,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of drugs.

1974
02:24:09,532 --> 02:24:10,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1975
02:24:12,155 --> 02:24:13,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys enjoy the pie.

1976
02:24:13,717 --> 02:24:14,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we do.

1977
02:24:14,998 --> 02:24:15,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Punch and pie.

1978
02:24:16,019 --> 02:24:18,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have punch but I have apple juice so it'll be juice and pie.

1979
02:24:19,670 --> 02:24:19,910
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1980
02:24:21,130 --> 02:24:22,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe, thank you for being here.

1981
02:24:22,591 --> 02:24:25,472
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya, thank you as always for your contributions to the website.

1982
02:24:25,592 --> 02:24:29,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of folks don't know, but you actually contribute a lot of the stories to the show every week.

1983
02:24:29,273 --> 02:24:30,213
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for being here.

1984
02:24:30,513 --> 02:24:30,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

1985
02:24:31,154 --> 02:24:32,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you have any final thoughts?

1986
02:24:32,714 --> 02:24:34,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear you're popular on the Internet.

1987
02:24:34,515 --> 02:24:35,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm popular on the Internet.

1988
02:24:35,575 --> 02:24:37,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am popular on the Internet, you bastard.

1989
02:24:38,036 --> 02:24:38,496
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1990
02:24:38,716 --> 02:24:40,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's your final thought for tonight?

1991
02:24:42,877 --> 02:24:48,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thought is I need to play more Noby Noby voice now that I actually know what I'm supposed to be doing in it.

1992
02:24:49,198 --> 02:24:54,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, my only complaint, that camera fucking sucks in Noby Noby Boy.

1993
02:24:54,892 --> 02:24:55,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Poop more.

1994
02:24:56,296 --> 02:24:57,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I do need to poop more in that game.

1995
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:03,231
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, last but not least

1996
02:25:29,571 --> 02:25:30,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Your final thought.

1997
02:25:34,761 --> 02:25:34,902
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1998
02:25:36,224 --> 02:25:37,266
[SPEAKER_05]: No is your final thought.

1999
02:25:37,787 --> 02:25:38,368
[SPEAKER_05]: No means no.

2000
02:25:39,426 --> 02:25:39,726
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2001
02:25:39,786 --> 02:25:43,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2002
02:25:43,490 --> 02:25:44,851
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

2003
02:25:44,991 --> 02:25:45,471
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true.

2004
02:25:45,551 --> 02:25:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't just a line.

2005
02:25:46,893 --> 02:25:51,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Without you guys, we wouldn't exist because it's all about independent podcasts.

2006
02:25:51,657 --> 02:25:54,479
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you enjoy what you hear, all you have to do, help us spread the word.

2007
02:25:54,559 --> 02:25:55,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell two people about the show.

2008
02:25:56,161 --> 02:25:57,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Leave us a nice review on iTunes.

2009
02:25:57,762 --> 02:25:58,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Help us spread the word.

2010
02:25:58,523 --> 02:25:59,263
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we ask.

2011
02:25:59,363 --> 02:26:01,445
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't put advertising in the show or any of that stuff.

2012
02:26:01,545 --> 02:26:04,448
[SPEAKER_05]: We just give up our time on Sunday nights because we like it.

2013
02:26:04,788 --> 02:26:06,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun, and we like attention.

2014
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:09,232
[SPEAKER_05]: and we like to be popular on the internet, right Joe?

2015
02:26:09,853 --> 02:26:10,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2016
02:26:11,114 --> 02:26:11,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it.

2017
02:26:12,135 --> 02:26:13,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for listening to us tonight.

2018
02:26:13,697 --> 02:26:16,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one and thanks for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2019
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:17,541
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next week.

2020
02:26:18,314 --> 02:26:21,095
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2021
02:26:21,595 --> 02:26:24,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2022
02:26:25,277 --> 02:26:33,900
[SPEAKER_09]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2023
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:46,004
[SPEAKER_09]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2024
02:26:46,605 --> 02:26:47,405
[SPEAKER_09]: See you next week!

2025
02:26:56,369 --> 02:26:58,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do something we don't usually do in the afterbirth here.

2026
02:26:58,571 --> 02:27:02,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make an outbound call because I saw someone join chat and I want to talk to him.

2027
02:27:02,253 --> 02:27:04,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll leave this in the podcast for fun.

2028
02:27:04,415 --> 02:27:10,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually we do a little live only thing after the show and play some copyrighted music, but tonight we'll do something special.

2029
02:27:11,139 --> 02:27:11,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Rob.

2030
02:27:11,940 --> 02:27:12,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Rob.

2031
02:27:13,561 --> 02:27:13,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

2032
02:27:13,961 --> 02:27:14,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

2033
02:27:14,241 --> 02:27:14,662
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

2034
02:27:16,025 --> 02:27:18,987
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit surprised that this is the first time Orange Lounge Radio has called me.

2035
02:27:19,087 --> 02:27:22,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it doesn't happen very often, but I saw you join chat.

2036
02:27:22,408 --> 02:27:24,569
[SPEAKER_05]: You had incredible timing in joining chat.

2037
02:27:24,609 --> 02:27:26,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And my first thought was, were your ears burning?

2038
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:27,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were just talking about you.

2039
02:27:28,752 --> 02:27:30,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Street Fighter IV Tournament

2040
02:27:51,341 --> 02:27:52,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved on to the second round.

2041
02:27:52,682 --> 02:27:55,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got that little blue sheet that says KO first round.

2042
02:27:55,224 --> 02:27:57,385
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to go to the second round, so yay me.

2043
02:27:57,985 --> 02:28:02,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean you won the store, or did the top three get to go, or what?

2044
02:28:03,429 --> 02:28:04,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's what happened.

2045
02:28:04,149 --> 02:28:09,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually lost in the winner's bracket to the guy who eventually won it.

2046
02:28:10,693 --> 02:28:15,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I won the loser's bracket, faced him again in the grand final, so to speak, and lost to him again.

2047
02:28:16,117 --> 02:28:17,758
[SPEAKER_01]: The sad thing is I won three rounds every time.

2048
02:28:18,466 --> 02:28:20,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna ask who your character of choice is.

2049
02:28:20,149 --> 02:28:20,649
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Ryu, is your guy?

2050
02:28:35,693 --> 02:28:36,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put it this way.

2051
02:28:36,393 --> 02:28:39,134
[SPEAKER_01]: My aim screen name is RyuRobD, so yes.

2052
02:28:41,234 --> 02:28:41,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

2053
02:28:41,775 --> 02:28:42,055
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2054
02:28:42,435 --> 02:28:43,535
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I don't know what it is.

2055
02:28:43,615 --> 02:28:45,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to feel out different characters.

2056
02:28:45,615 --> 02:28:47,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, I used to be Chun-Li.

2057
02:28:49,176 --> 02:28:52,557
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I love Chun-Li, and that was the one I used to use all the time.

2058
02:28:52,597 --> 02:29:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, after Super Street Fighter 2 and everything, I think I really like Fei Long, especially after playing him in Street Fighter 4.

2059
02:29:00,339 --> 02:29:00,919
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the thing.

2060
02:29:00,999 --> 02:29:03,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so challenged by the controls.

2061
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:10,024
[SPEAKER_05]: in freaking, you know, the Xbox 360, because it's really hard on that little D-pad to do three fireballs all in a row.

2062
02:29:10,864 --> 02:29:16,388
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going to actually ask you next, how do you get around the control issue, or have you stuck it out with the D-pad?

2063
02:29:16,428 --> 02:29:17,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have to use the D-pad in the tournament?

2064
02:29:17,709 --> 02:29:18,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I've stuck it out with the D-pad.

2065
02:29:18,669 --> 02:29:19,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really used to it at this point.

2066
02:29:20,911 --> 02:29:26,054
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has calloused my thumb entirely, but I'm used to it at this point, so I can actually do pretty much anything.

2067
02:29:26,074 --> 02:29:28,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do even Zangief's Spitting Pilot Driver.

2068
02:29:30,016 --> 02:29:31,698
[SPEAKER_01]: The double quarter circle forward motions are still...

2069
02:29:32,819 --> 02:29:33,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

2070
02:29:49,432 --> 02:29:51,333
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the opponent is flying up in the air and coming down.

2071
02:29:51,373 --> 02:29:53,013
[SPEAKER_05]: You just fucking lost me, but that's all right.

2072
02:29:54,574 --> 02:29:58,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming that's just massive death right there, some type of massive death.

2073
02:29:58,795 --> 02:30:00,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

2074
02:30:01,776 --> 02:30:02,097
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2075
02:30:02,137 --> 02:30:02,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hey, you know what?

2076
02:30:02,997 --> 02:30:03,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations to you.

2077
02:30:03,937 --> 02:30:04,597
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome.

2078
02:30:04,617 --> 02:30:05,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

2079
02:30:05,378 --> 02:30:10,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to hear about the whole how it went because we had a couple people calling in saying, yeah, I lost, yeah, I lost.

2080
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:12,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, good luck in round two.

2081
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:14,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to be able to make it out there for round two, you think?

2082
02:30:15,633 --> 02:30:16,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.

2083
02:30:16,073 --> 02:30:21,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple people saying that they'll actually drive me, which, as a poor college student with no car, is a good thing.

2084
02:30:22,415 --> 02:30:39,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the funniest story I heard about the tournament this weekend is, this could just be someone bullshitting on an internet message board, but supposedly someone was at a tournament and he's like, oh, we're just in some small little town, this will be easy to win, and then all of a sudden they're like, okay, first round we've got Justin Wong, can he come to Station A?

2085
02:30:40,419 --> 02:30:44,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know who he is, he's a famous Marvel vs. Capcom 2 player.

2086
02:30:44,161 --> 02:30:45,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even I've heard that name.

2087
02:30:46,242 --> 02:30:47,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I've heard that name.

2088
02:30:47,843 --> 02:30:51,666
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have an arcade here in Folsom that did huge Capcom events.

2089
02:30:51,766 --> 02:30:55,388
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a DDR tournament there years ago and it was still open.

2090
02:30:55,988 --> 02:30:56,649
[SPEAKER_05]: That is funny.

2091
02:30:58,210 --> 02:30:59,951
[SPEAKER_01]: How unlucky do you have to be, really?

2092
02:31:00,731 --> 02:31:01,111
[SPEAKER_05]: How funny.

2093
02:31:01,812 --> 02:31:05,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, one other question I want to ask you, since you're the best Street Fighter 4 player I know.

2094
02:31:07,055 --> 02:31:07,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2095
02:31:07,775 --> 02:31:09,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a lot on the show.

2096
02:31:10,857 --> 02:31:18,882
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, what are some tips for those of us that consistently get our ass kicked by Seth, who suck at the game, any advice for us to get better?

2097
02:31:19,883 --> 02:31:25,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly stay out of throw range when he wakes up, because what he likes to do is do that stupid Shoryuken spinning pile driver move, so

2098
02:31:26,058 --> 02:31:28,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Staying a couple steps away from him when he wakes up would help a lot.

2099
02:31:29,579 --> 02:31:34,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Really wait for him to make a move and then sweep him because the computer is very vulnerable to that, especially on the easier difficulties.

2100
02:31:36,342 --> 02:31:37,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just use your safest moves against him.

2101
02:31:38,183 --> 02:31:41,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Any tips for online in the non-Seth type battles?

2102
02:31:42,565 --> 02:31:50,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Online, for the Ryu players, let them make mistakes because they're usually aggressive and most of them can't even shore Yuken, so they're vulnerable to air attacks.

2103
02:31:50,808 --> 02:31:53,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of their game usually revolves around just

2104
02:31:54,284 --> 02:31:54,964
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2105
02:32:18,037 --> 02:32:19,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she's interesting.

2106
02:32:19,198 --> 02:32:21,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how she resembles Vanessa a lot from King of Fighters.

2107
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:25,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea if you... I'm telling you, does she not look like an SNK character?

2108
02:32:26,103 --> 02:32:27,564
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about this at the beginning of the show.

2109
02:32:28,224 --> 02:32:30,766
[SPEAKER_01]: She absolutely does, especially since she's got the red hair.

2110
02:32:30,826 --> 02:32:33,227
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a special agent type character, that sort of thing.

2111
02:32:33,448 --> 02:32:35,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny for her, I think, but hey.

2112
02:32:36,310 --> 02:32:36,550
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2113
02:32:36,990 --> 02:32:42,013
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Rob, we're going to let you go and get to the rest of our after show or actually close the podcast at this point.

2114
02:32:42,053 --> 02:32:45,856
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much for letting us harass you and surprising you with a phone call and telling us about your experience.

2115
02:32:46,482 --> 02:32:47,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure.

2116
02:32:47,084 --> 02:32:47,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good night, guys.

2117
02:32:48,086 --> 02:32:50,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Rob.

2118
02:32:51,033 --> 02:32:52,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the podcast is really over.

2119
02:32:53,058 --> 02:32:53,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night.
