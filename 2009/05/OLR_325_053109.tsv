13973	15196	and I on May 31st, 2009.
15416	23774	The PSP Go gets confirmed a bit early, Matrix Online decides to pull the plug, and on the eve of the Expo, we go over all the eve
31448	35610	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35630	41392	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41452	43352	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.
43733	47354	Say hello as well to my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49054	49715	How are you doing?
50815	51835	At least you have a voice.
51935	53676	My voice is leaving.
53776	54456	I had a busy weekend.
54496	56957	I should make you some coffee or some tea or something.
57017	58357	Coffee would be awesome, actually.
58577	59978	Why don't I make some coffee?
59998	60918	That would be super exciting.
60998	62819	I will do that after I announce my gaming week.
62839	66320	Yeah, I was going to say, we're trying to do a show right now, so maybe we'll get into that in a little bit.
66560	68600	I will use my Sensio.
68940	69260	Awesome.
69941	70201	Awesome.
70241	71821	I can't wait for hot coffee.
72581	73742	Fresh from Dark Sakura.
73762	74482	Oh.
76003	77183	On second thought, go get yourself.
78064	81886	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki who has a thread on his shirt that's bugging the hell out of me.
81906	82286	There it is.
84127	84967	Why did she do that?
85207	85828	Should I put it back?
85848	86688	No.
86708	86848	Okay.
88449	88729	I see.
89350	90590	That's what wives are supposed to do.
90610	91571	How are you, Tech Master Loki?
91591	92811	I'm doing fine.
92831	93051	Yeah?
93171	94012	That's what I try to do.
95348	96489	I've been busy Getting ready for E3?
96609	96809	Uh, no
111661	112802	No, me neither.
112902	117924	I am so not ready for E3, which is actually why I'm kind of excited that I don't have a lot of commitments.
118204	123806	You know, the great thing about you and I, and unfortunately DarkSakura can't go this year, but hopefully next year she can go again.
124166	128868	The great thing about us going to E3 is that we don't answer to nobody.
129228	132169	We only answer to you guys, the listeners, really direct what we do at E3.
132189	133470	And we don't answer to them either.
133490	135731	And sometimes we decide not to listen to them either.
136471	137292	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
153446	154786	Screw responsibility!
180675	184119	E3 this year, I'm not feeling it as much as I have in years past.
184439	187683	And I know there's a lot of people that are like, you effing bastard.
188283	194491	I have always wanted to go to E3, and you're sitting there going, well, I'm going to E3, but I feel kind of half-assed about it this year.
194911	196953	From my perspective, in my defense a little bit,
197853	198674	DarkSakura.com
215350	215530	Right.
215610	227898	And none of my friends, you know, outside of the three of us are really going except for some of my long distance friends like Bobby and, you know, Kropotkin and some of the, you know, all games people are going to be there.
228198	232541	But I'm talking about, you know, some of my local friends used to be like 10 of us that would go and none of them are going.
232581	234202	So it's kind of weird this year.
235043	237204	I'm going to feel a little lonely at E3.
237264	239706	So if you happen to be going to E3, I might need a hug.
241220	243000	Because I'm feeling a little lonely this year.
243020	244101	Sinbad will hug you.
244241	244601	Yay.
244961	247502	And you know how we used to have the kick in Ultracade?
248062	249182	This is a hug-a-Rob.
250122	258484	So everyone go around, hug Rob, post your pictures to pics at orangejohnsradio.com And just remind me that I don't have to be alone.
259184	261645	Give Rob some love before he cries like an emo child.
262839	263780	I don't understand, Robb.
278453	281076	I'm in another city, I'm having fun You had lesbians to hang out with
301932	303673	I know, and I got to see the lesbians there.
303713	305253	But the lesbians aren't going to E3.
305573	307714	How is E3 supposed to be any fun without lesbians?
308414	309895	Hopefully there's some lesbians at E3 somewhere.
309915	310935	Every convention needs more gays.
310955	312656	I need a hug from lesbians at E3.
312696	313216	That's what I need.
313396	315057	Every convention is better with more gays.
315137	316217	Enough of my whining.
316257	317998	Let me introduce the chat room as well.
318038	322720	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And look, I got a hug from Redertainment already in chat.
322860	323740	A nice virtual hug.
323760	324660	Well, thank you guys very much.
325801	326141	And from...
327221	329503	and Milma13120 as well.
330003	330964	So hooray for hugs.
331184	332124	And hooray for new people.
332164	335346	I see a lot of people in the chat that I have not seen before.
335386	336447	So I think we have some new listeners.
337148	341130	CyberBeast41, I think, was saying he's in Belgium and listening for the first time.
341470	342471	So welcome.
342831	344232	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
369744	374865	My gaming week was pretty much The Sims, as I'm doing right now.
375746	377066	Awesome.
377366	387849	And actually, I did do some looking into Sims 3, so I'm very much looking forward to getting my hands on that.
388328	413883	and you know this we do have to remember you know there might be some people out there going oh my gosh The Sims but The Sims is like the best-selling PC game ever so you know we do have to remember that there is a huge audience for these games and a lot of anticipation I don't know about your neck of the woods folks but I was seeing a bunch of billboards in the Bay Area this weekend for Sims 3 they have this whole let there be Sims campaign going on so this is setting up to be a big event and it's all next week same time as E3
414443	424831	I'll be honest, the biggest thing that I like to do, and I quit playing it because that was all I was doing for a while, it's pretty much the thing that I like to do is make houses.
425391	427173	I love designing shit.
427673	429474	I love designing shit.
429554	431896	I mean, I guess maybe that's why I'm in school for it, maybe?
432657	439241	But the most fun for me has really been getting these bizarro little houses and putting them together.
439281	441303	I've been greatly enjoying it.
441743	445006	I can sympathize, DarkSakura, because that's why I love Quake Life.
445066	448108	Because I love shooting people in the face.
448629	450330	I love shooting people in the face, too!
450390	453112	That's what I'm trying to study in school, is shooting people in the face.
453252	454493	What a coincidence!
454533	456975	I had to make my own major for that.
456995	460778	That's actually part of a designer's job, is shooting their clients in the face when they're belligerent.
461539	462320	I'm sorry, I'm kidding.
462400	463581	That won't get me any clients.
463781	465442	Obviously, I'm just teasing DarkSakura.
466563	467664	That was a little parody there.
468988	471791	I was parodying your parody.
472391	473893	I was paradizing your parody.
474433	475655	I consider my parody parried.
476696	480079	Yeah, I'm going to get your coffee now.
480379	481060	Alright, yay.
481580	483442	Good, because I don't want you to hear about my gaming week.
484183	486365	Loki, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
487486	488747	I only played really two different things.
489448	491771	First being the modified version of Grand Theft Auto 4.
492171	507127	We're still tweaking it to get it just right, but now we have flying police cars, super ambulances, guns that shoot fire, guns that shoot explosions, guns that shoot blasts of air that launch people into the air.
507527	508428	So it's been a lot of fun.
509977	523248	I'm actually looking forward to one of the stories we're going to get into later, where they're actually going to have the expansions on their own disc, because then I can actually edit everything in Lost and Damned and the new expansions, so that'll be cool.
523808	532335	And then today I decided to play my copy of Fuel that I got a little early, and that's actually really fun.
532375	534917	And when they tell you that it has 1,800 square kilometers in the game...
539235	540515	Thanks for watching!
561388	563689	I'm talking like the most direct route I could possibly take.
563849	570173	Like, not on roads, just going straight towards the next outpost, over mountains, everything.
570513	573715	It's just insane, the size of the game.
573895	584581	And what's even better, though, is the fact that you don't really have to do the races, because there's actually... The currency in the game is fuel, and there's these oil barrels that you'll find that you just run into them and you get...
585902	587843	More fuel to buy new cars.
588583	591525	But it's an awesome game, and it's going to be really fun online.
591845	596928	So if you're a fan of racing games, especially like Motorstorm, definitely going to be a game for you.
597287	610399	Now, here's the burning question I have about this game Fuel, because they talk about, you know, that there's all this vast amount of land, that it's like huge, you know, all this area that you can drive, but is it interesting backdrop, drop, or is it desert bus thrilling?
610539	613962	I mean... No, it's very, there's a lot of variety in the terrain.
614122	615303	I mean, a lot of variety.
615323	620508	I mean, you'll get up on top of a mountain, you'll look, and you can see like mountains way in the distance, and you can actually drive there.
621008	623129	So it's kind of like Oblivion, but for driving.
623169	625231	Because that's the feel I get from Oblivion.
625271	627132	It's like, Oblivion is effing huge.
627192	631455	You will never see everything in that game unless you are a sick, sad person.
631495	632055	You know what I mean?
632135	636998	This seriously... Okay, I got tired from driving.
637298	641101	Like, it took me so long to get to the next destination.
641281	643863	I got, like, driver's syndrome or whatever, you know?
643963	644863	I felt tired.
645243	648826	In fact, that's actually when I turned the game off because I'd been playing for a few hours, but...
650429	651210	It's actually really fun.
651230	652671	There's a lot of variety.
652711	656074	There's a lot of events that you can do or you can just drive around.
656114	658776	You can make your own events and challenge people online with them.
661218	666342	There's a bunch of different environments, day-night cycles, different weather effects that you have.
668024	668824	Lots of forests.
669125	672848	I was driving through forests and then driving across farmland.
673248	673528	DarkSakura
695506	696287	F-Zero or Forza?
696307	697888	What are the controls?
722125	723966	and probably just like Motorstorm.
724006	726527	I mean, there's no nitrous in it, but it's very simple.
726587	732609	It's like, you know, right trigger for accelerator, left trigger for brake, and then X for handbrake.
732769	733169	That's it.
733590	735070	I'm very curious about this.
735330	736391	You definitely piqued my interest.
736671	742173	Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, it's made by Codemasters and they make pretty damn awesome driving games.
742613	745274	Yeah, like Dirt was a really... That was Codemasters, right?
745294	745795	That was Codemasters, yeah.
745815	748696	That was a really interesting game to look at, but I couldn't control it for crap.
748716	749676	See, this is the other thing.
750176	751477	The graphics in it aren't...
751957	752657	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
779921	780442	Thanks for watching!
794787	798508	I haven't heard a lot about this game, so maybe this is going to be a sleeper hit.
798548	800209	It's been getting okay reviews.
800489	801189	I mean, it's fun.
801669	803650	Where are people critical of the game, and do you agree?
803710	809772	I haven't read the reviews yet, but I just saw the number of reviews, and they're getting mid-8s, mid-7s, low-8s.
811072	813113	But, I mean, it's just a number.
813833	817734	I've been looking forward to this game ever since they announced it, and I think it's worth it.
817834	818695	It's going to be very fun.
820782	827007	You know, the fact that they have online, you can do online free mode, so basically you're just driving with your friends.
827587	828868	Well, that was kind of Test Drive, wasn't it?
828888	829709	It was very similar to that?
829769	830509	Test Drive sucked.
831030	832251	I mean... I thought it was okay.
832271	833652	Okay, Test Drive was awful.
833812	840617	I mean, like, the landscape was very plain, and the police couldn't chase after you off the road.
840797	842699	It was just... I don't know.
842939	845941	But, um... Yeah, it's gonna be a good game.
846261	847102	Comes out next week.
848423	848503	Um...
849742	851084	Definitely worth picking it up.
851244	855770	Redertainment in our chatroom asks, Racing Tornadoes, is Helen Hunt involved in this game?
856599	857039	I don't know.
857279	858820	People have been looking for tornadoes.
859101	861002	I mean, I haven't found one yet.
861382	866565	I've just, the only kind of weather that I've driven through, maybe just because I'm only in the one section of the map.
867065	871248	Although, I mean, the other sections of the map are locked, but not necessarily.
871448	877391	I mean, you can drive to them and stuff, but none of the events appear until you've unlocked so many races and stuff.
877431	880113	But, I mean, free mode, you can drive across the whole thing.
880173	884275	And I would be willing to bet it'd take a few hours to get from one side of the map to the other.
884315	884895	I mean, it's huge.
884916	884976	Wow.
885916	886636	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
913717	915618	My game of the week has been interesting.
915698	921959	I haven't had a lot of time to play games because I've been out of town this week, but I decided to try something different this week.
922479	926961	If you were listening to the show last week, you heard that I've been kind of disillusioned with a lot of stuff that's been going on in Warcraft lately.
926981	930542	I think I've just kind of hit my saturation point with the game itself.
930662	931562	I just need a break.
931842	936924	The expansion, even though they have the new dungeon, the old war and all that stuff, I'm just not feeling it.
937044	938184	I needed a break from WoW.
939205	953484	So I got a great idea for something I could do actually as an article for OrangeLawnTrader.com and what I'm doing is an article about what I have missed in two and a half years in Final Fantasy XI and I reactivated my account this week on Final Fantasy XI.
953504	954185	Oh my god!
955518	960980	I had to come right back in the room to hear Rob say something that I was dreading.
961120	964542	Now, something you should know, I have not told anybody this.
964742	966143	Not a single... No.
966843	969644	One person I told this because of another conversation we were having.
970244	970765	One person.
971025	971205	New.
971605	972045	Until now.
972145	972745	Now, like, what?
973066	974526	However many people are listening, no.
975006	980549	So it's kind of something I was keeping a little bit under wraps because it was something, you know, I wanted to kind of see...
981209	1009541	what's what I've been missing and what I could pick up on I'll tell you what damn there is a lot that has changed it was really hard for me to kind of get back into it but I will say this one thing I've noticed and I'll write a full because I'm not I'm nowhere near ready enough to write something full for the website yet and believe me there will be a long article coming on the website later I will notice this one of the first things I noticed right away they have made it way easier to solo in that game like there is so much more you can do in the first like 15 levels than you could before me to go back and play
1010881	1018364	I am honestly going to say, if you quit this game because grouping was too much for you, there might be more in this game for you now.
1019504	1022205	Well, that was the big thing, is I hated being the party bitch.
1022265	1035209	With the addition of the field manuals and this stuff, where you can kind of get experience for WoW-style questing, and the fact that now easy prey monsters are a lot easier to kill and give you like 60 experience, whereas before they would give you like 15 experience.
1035589	1036370	Thank you for watching!
1051945	1054607	It's going to be interesting to see what happens.
1054967	1056429	I don't know how long I'm going to stick with it.
1056589	1056929	I don't know.
1057029	1060152	You know, a big reason I stuck with WoW as long as I did is the people.
1060752	1062814	And in Final Fantasy XI right now, there is no people.
1062934	1066598	I know one person that's playing and I have yet to run into them in the game.
1067058	1067939	So I don't know.
1068439	1085471	I don't know how it's gonna go, but I wanted to really see because part of the reason I did this is because I have been so critical of Final Fantasy XI on the show and I've kind of joked with listeners that I do feel I owe it to give the educated opinion if I'm gonna knock on the game to see what I've missed in two and a half years because every single person I talk to
1085851	1088413	that still plays the game says, Rob, it has changed.
1088854	1091336	Level syncing revolutionized the game.
1091476	1092237	You need to go back.
1092717	1093698	So, I went back.
1094198	1094899	So we'll see what happens.
1095560	1096480	So I'm giving it a month.
1097041	1097882	If I like it, I'll stay.
1097922	1101145	If I don't, I'll go back to WoW because I'll probably miss it in about a month's time.
1101485	1106709	But honestly, with E3 this week and everything else, I don't expect to see the story on OrangeLondrina.com for about two weeks.
1106990	1110513	Because this next week, I'm not going to be... So it won't be for like two weeks.
1110893	1112595	In case of irony, I'm actually going to...
1113382	1114182	Sony Online.
1114202	1120946	They're going to give me a walkthrough of all their MMOs, which is great because I don't have time to play any of them.
1123287	1125408	But man, I want to check out APB when that's there.
1125828	1126729	That's going to be there.
1127789	1129310	I hope Star Trek Online makes an appearance.
1129350	1129590	We'll see.
1130309	1138351	To quote GS68 in the chat room, it says, an e-drinking game rule, every time Sky talks about MMOs, chug until he stops talking about them.
1138771	1140672	And I told him not to do that because I'd die of liver failure.
1141832	1143432	I know, it seems like all I ever talk about is MMOs.
1143452	1148333	Well, I needed something, you know, just Warcraft just kind of, you know, I needed a break.
1149134	1153255	Which is sad because I had a break not that long ago, but, you know, it is what it is.
1153435	1154975	If games aren't fun, I don't play them.
1155075	1157736	So I decided to try to have fun somewhere else.
1158016	1158436	So we'll see.
1159628	1161850	Anyhow, more to come on that in future weeks.
1162090	1163551	That was pretty much it for my game of the week.
1163571	1166413	I played some Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but it's all stuff I've talked about before.
1167153	1169154	I'm sure you all were going to get a kick out of that one anyway.
1169174	1171196	Oh, and the show wasn't uploaded because his drive failed.
1171980	1172981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1200701	1227732	But at least I hope, I didn't check But I don't think there would be a reason I'm pretty sure we always would copy them over So we should be caught up on the podcast sometime this week It's going to be very tough with E3 and everything going on But I want to get at least last week's show up Like tomorrow before I leave We'll slowly get caught up But that's the reason why the podcast feed is behind And we are really, really sorry But these things happen Technical difficulties I wasn't here last week because I was laying floor
1229928	1231389	Which I just finished today.
1232590	1233591	It took forever.
1234171	1234712	But it looks nice.
1235292	1236833	Ranma in chat says, Sky, it's not lost.
1236873	1237814	I can tell you how to retrieve it.
1237854	1239895	Don't worry, we have a backup copy here on this computer.
1239955	1242537	It's not going to need anything fancier or what have you.
1243577	1248801	Especially if somebody's been bootlegging the show now, which I heard has been happening, just in case of future loss.
1249421	1249902	We're fine.
1249962	1251523	We should have everything on this computer.
1252163	1254185	Stay tuned to our Twitter for more updates.
1254225	1257407	And by the way, if you're not on the Twitter for OLR,
1258347	1259148	Please get on there.
1259228	1265793	Twitter.com slash OLR because I'm telling you what, the Twitter users are going to be controlling E3 for Orange Lounge Radio.
1265853	1267594	We are going to be tweeting from the show floor.
1267995	1268955	What do you want us to look at?
1269036	1270116	What do you want pictures of?
1270457	1271958	What do you want us to ask?
1272118	1274880	What games are you not hearing enough about on the main sites?
1275160	1284407	Because you know everybody's going to be talking about PSP Go and whatever Microsoft says and if Nintendo throws out a new Mario game, they're going to be talking about that and that there's going to be so many games that are overlooked.
1284768	1286409	That's what we're focusing on at E3 this year.
1286489	1287650	The stuff that everyone else...
1287890	1289892	You have to find the Korean porn games.
1290532	1292274	We will be looking for the Korean porn games.
1292294	1292734	You betcha.
1293075	1293635	I hope they're there.
1293956	1298219	I hope the loss of Kensha Hall did not make us lose the porn games.
1298460	1299721	I love Kensha Hall.
1299961	1300181	I know.
1300221	1301402	I'm very sad to see it's gone.
1301702	1305626	But it looks like they have a lot of those developers in West Hall on the side.
1305706	1306227	So we'll see.
1306967	1309630	I'm thinking they just did some clever rearranging of things.
1309950	1311772	And there are a few people that aren't there this year.
1312092	1314434	We don't have Atari this year, which, by the way, Loki reminded me.
1314734	1316996	There won't be Star Trek online because Atari's not there.
1317377	1320039	But, you know, there's some other companies that aren't there.
1320059	1322962	You're normally in the closet anyways over there.
1322982	1323943	Remember last time?
1325741	1327823	Oh, Atari, you're only one of the big innovators.
1327843	1328464	Stupid douchebag.
1328724	1332607	Who was that douchebag with the skateboard with carpet on it?
1333028	1334809	With the PSP inside the skateboard?
1334829	1335250	Nah.
1335530	1335930	Oh, God.
1335970	1336791	Yeah, I remember that guy.
1337712	1340054	Anyway, I will be at the show Tuesday, Wednesday.
1340134	1341815	Loki will be at the show Wednesday, Thursday.
1341895	1343937	So between the two of us, we'll have the show covered all three days.
1344438	1348301	At least I think I am going to a party Wednesday night.
1348321	1351544	I'm hearing all these people talk about, oh, I got invited to seven parties and all this stuff.
1351884	1356048	I think we're going to a party Wednesday night for Games for Windows.
1356068	1358570	And thank you very much for passing along the invite for that.
1358831	1360332	We're going to check it out, see what that's all about.
1360372	1361073	PC games.
1361493	1363375	I know that's something DarkSakura's into, obviously.
1363475	1368059	So I think for her, we need to check out what Games for Windows is all about and see what they're going to be announcing there.
1368419	1369399	Find out what doesn't suck.
1369839	1370240	Definitely.
1370640	1374381	Alright, speaking of what doesn't suck, we got so much news this week to get to.
1374701	1376661	We're already 20 minutes into the show and then some.
1376761	1378322	Let's get into the gaming news this week.
1378502	1379482	Loki, start us off.
1379702	1379982	Yes.
1381163	1394927	So, the rumor is that the PlayStation Slim or PlayStation 3 Slimmer model, whatever they're going to call it, is supposed to be coming out August or September according to the Ars Technica Mole.
1395467	1395707	Now,
1397028	1397971	Why should we believe this?
1398272	1400821	Well, because they were the one that talked about PSP Go.
1401837	1402857	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1429332	1433034	What's interesting though, there's a lot of people that say the PS3 Slim is still BS.
1433274	1444701	And I was listening to Bobby, who's on right before us on All Games Radio, and he was talking about how his hardware expert folks that help him do Friday Night Gaming don't think that it could fit.
1445362	1449665	That there's so much that goes with Blu-ray that you can't slim it down that much more.
1450205	1456529	Now my thought is maybe there's a technology we're unaware of yet, I don't know.
1457209	1458410	I think that it's going to happen.
1459344	1461306	I mean, we're going to find out about it tomorrow.
1462546	1464168	Or, not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.
1464348	1466289	Well, I don't think we're actually going to find out about it tomorrow.
1466369	1470252	I think there's a good argument being made that they want to keep this thing under wraps.
1470893	1474015	Notice how this got ceased and desisted.
1474716	1484243	Whereas nothing else that's been leaked from Sony, including things we're going to get into later and so on, that a lot of you probably heard about, have not been ceased and desisted.
1484263	1485363	But there's a reason for that.
1486244	1489886	The reason why... Because it's all going to be revealed Wednesday anyway.
1489926	1491707	It's all about hype, right?
1492007	1498270	This was probably going to be a big surprise or something, but the other PSP Go stuff, that's already been released by Sony.
1499191	1499911	I mean, it's...
1502530	1515695	If the PS3 comes out, or they come out Wednesday and say the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting a slim model in a few months, sales of the PlayStation 3 will stop.
1516255	1519897	It will come to a standstill because everybody's going to be waiting for this new system.
1519937	1520277	No, it won't.
1520377	1520977	And you know why?
1521037	1524598	It's because of the same reason why there's a new SKU of the PlayStation 3 every time.
1524999	1526259	They don't stop sales.
1526659	1529981	And if anything, what they'll do is a price drop on the current system.
1530001	1530841	They'll drop it down.
1531241	1537483	to clear out inventory, and then you'll have the new system coming out at this normal price.
1538103	1539964	They've done the same pattern every time.
1540744	1552248	It was $4.99, or before it was $5.99, $4.99, and then they would drop the system that was $5.99 down to $4.99 and clear it out, and then the new system would come out at $5.99.
1552929	1556090	Well, now that they've dropped it to $100 again, it's $4.99, $3.99, same type of thing's going to happen.
1556110	1556930	These are going to drop down to maybe $50.00,
1560595	1575878	and they're going to clear them out or they may even just keep offering it on the side and just have this one SKU or whatever later on towards the holidays but they're just going to drop the price of it a little bit until the systems clear out and then they're going to have the new one.
1577970	1578810	All right, well, we'll see.
1578950	1584931	I mean, there's a lot to be seen out of the press conference, and I think this is one of the will-they-or-won't-they items.
1585031	1595134	But one interesting thing, I don't know if it's going to be covered tomorrow at the whole press conference, but apparently Africa is finally getting some type of U.S.
1595194	1595574	release.
1595654	1596174	That's right.
1596694	1601575	Apparently Africa is finally going to be coming to the U.S., but they changed the spelling back.
1601915	1604215	It's actually going to be Africa with a C now.
1604275	1606876	It's not going to be with a K. Apparently it was a big part of it.
1607216	1608116	How could they do that to us?
1608136	1609097	It's not Africa.
1609257	1610057	It's Africa.
1610477	1610817	Oh, sorry.
1611277	1611757	Africa.
1612958	1616779	But apparently with less K and more C. I don't know.
1616819	1618119	Was it offensive or something?
1618159	1619520	I don't know why, but yeah.
1619980	1629143	They are deciding to change the name back to Africa with a C. But it is finally coming out for the PlayStation 3, so if you were importing it, you don't really have to do that anymore.
1629283	1630043	Can we hunt animals?
1630303	1630463	No.
1631443	1631904	Dang it.
1632044	1633124	I am not buying this at all.
1634912	1636213	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1656600	1657721	Real quick before we get to the next story.
1657761	1659461	TigerClaw says, that's a damn shame.
1659501	1661582	I kind of like the other title, Hakuna Matata.
1662343	1669126	Well, it is kind of a cute title, but I bet Disney would glare if that happened here in the U.S.
1669786	1671207	That game actually came out with release.
1671467	1674308	I mean, it's not like they own the rights to that phrase, but, you know, come on.
1675829	1679911	Whenever you hear Hakuna Matata, you can't help but think of Hakuna Matata.
1680211	1683412	Well, now they're going to try to trademark the word up, so, you know.
1685575	1687196	They've already got one of the directions.
1687336	1688057	I mean, why not?
1690278	1693340	Hopefully they don't trademark Orange Lounge Radio or we're going to be in trouble.
1693500	1693820	I don't know.
1693840	1694241	We'll see.
1694641	1698023	We need to hurry up and actually get some sort of trademark.
1698063	1698763	Patent pending.
1699104	1699964	Yeah, patent pending.
1700144	1712492	Actually, did you know, if you search the internet, obviously there's the banned act that we do take our namesake from in Japan, although that's a Japanese artist, not an American artist.
1713132	1713253	Um...
1714233	1724443	There's some place, like some building or something, there's actually a music thing called the Orange Lounge, where I guess they have these musical acts come perform.
1724764	1726265	I think it's in Southern California, too.
1726285	1727567	I think it's some type of gallery or whatever.
1728147	1731611	I found it when doing a search one night, you know, randomly, just like, ooh, what else is named Orange Lounge out there?
1731631	1732952	How big are we on the internet?
1733112	1735454	Well, it's interesting because you would think they would have...
1736135	1741337	Really not like the fact that there's an Orange Lounge radio out there because we're both music oriented in a way.
1741637	1742417	But here's the catch.
1742718	1744038	We've been around since 2001.
1744098	1744518	They haven't.
1744938	1747980	So if they did say anything, we'd be able to say, we were first.
1748020	1748660	You change your name.
1748940	1749320	No, you.
1750341	1751681	But, I mean, you know.
1751861	1752341	Oh, you.
1752461	1753622	It would be interesting to see what happens.
1754022	1754782	Anyhow, enough of that.
1754842	1756083	Let's move on with the gaming news.
1758104	1760685	Well, we have some very interesting stuff.
1760765	1763826	And actually, it's a confirmation for something that...
1764888	1776014	Loki brought up is that Sony did accidentally let stuff out on the PSP Go, which, you know what, honestly, I think sometimes this accidental stuff is half on purpose.
1776314	1777395	Accidental my ass.
1778171	1783995	They throw it out enough for it to catch on and then say, oh no, cease and desist, get this crap off of here.
1784335	1786076	You know, just tease, tease, tease, tease, tease.
1786297	1797604	It's enough for the fanboys to get aroused by it, but not enough for the big sites, the AP, CNN, and all these to report on it just yet.
1797984	1798485	It's bait.
1799904	1800344	Exactly.
1800424	1810875	It's bait because it's basically generating buzz for this now so that you want to hear what's going to happen at the press conference and you all tune in to that to find out their other announcements.
1811055	1812477	It's bait is what it is.
1812882	1814203	Tell us a little more about it, DarkSakura.
1814463	1827670	Well, on Sony's core gaming show that they do, they posted the episode and then pulled it because they had talked about the PSP Go on there.
1827690	1832452	It has 16 gigabyte flash memory and Bluetooth support for mobile phone tethering.
1832632	1833313	That's pretty cool.
1834634	1840542	and also it mentioned Gran Turismo, LittleBigPlanet, Jak and Daxter and Metal Gear Games.
1842785	1850676	So there actually are some photos of it out and about and I'm trying to pull those up right now.
1850796	1851776	Well, that's very interesting.
1851816	1860820	I didn't catch the part about the mobile phone tethering, but isn't that interesting because we've heard reports that the new Apple firmware is supposed to support the whole tethering thing.
1860840	1863101	You're going to have to pay more money, but I wonder.
1863402	1864942	It's a very interesting time kind of thing.
1864962	1867063	I think the Bluetooth is there for the mobile phone tethering.
1867723	1868564	Yeah, just looking at this.
1868584	1868964	I think it's just.
1870472	1870912	DarkSakura.com
1893607	1894528	GoCondom
1921248	1930632	and you have a PS button and a Bluetooth light and some shoulder buttons of course are on the top.
1931372	1933153	But I don't know, it looks kind of cheap to me.
1934390	1936131	Interesting comment from SonOfDad in chat.
1936171	1937111	I like this observation.
1937211	1943493	If you notice John Collar say that with some games be announced at E3, they knew it was going to be leaked before E3.
1943673	1949235	So maybe the phrasing that they used in some of the interviews, they knew this was going to be leaked before E3 actually happened.
1949475	1949995	Oh, no doubt.
1950155	1950775	No doubt about it.
1950995	1952456	I mean, this is Sony.
1953669	1955149	And please excuse my voice tonight.
1955290	1959971	I don't know if I said it earlier in the show, but I've thrown out my voice this weekend with some of the other stuff I had going on.
1960151	1961171	Rob's changed his throat now.
1961191	1962492	He sounds like a 12-year-old boy.
1962512	1962672	I know.
1962712	1965513	If I crack while reading some of your chat comments, it's not puberty, okay?
1965553	1967913	It's just I've really hurt my voice this weekend.
1967933	1969174	But here's what really happened.
1970454	1970674	What?
1972575	1972835	Nothing.
1973815	1974295	Oh, I get it.
1974315	1974996	You were making a joke.
1975056	1975336	All right.
1975876	1976176	Anyhow.
1979252	1980774	Loki, make yourself useful.
1980854	1981454	Read some gaming news.
1981614	1986979	Alright, so more information from the quote-unquote leaked issue of Core.
1987539	1993064	They also had some different games that were being announced in there as well, including Gran Turismo PSP.
1994898	1999283	Right, Gran Turismo PSP being announced for the, or being announced.
2000144	2002527	Wasn't that supposed to have come out like years ago?
2002547	2005470	Yeah, I was like, wasn't Gran Turismo for the PSP announced like in 2005?
2005771	2006412	Exactly.
2007273	2010877	A new Jak and Daxter game for the PSP, well that's a surprise.
2011437	2014701	And also a new Metal Gear Solid game for the PSP.
2015987	2016787	which is interesting.
2017127	2021468	They also had other clips including footage from LittleBigPlanet which that looks awesome.
2022288	2024009	And some other stuff.
2024589	2027649	Possibility of Warhawk as well.
2029290	2029590	I don't know.
2030050	2035551	But I'm sure we're going to get a lot of PSP buzz coming from the press conference at E3.
2035811	2041132	To shut up those people that says that they really haven't released anything on the PSP in the past year which would be somewhat true.
2042025	2042565	You know what I mean?
2042585	2044447	A Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP?
2044487	2044747	That's huge.
2048021	2050182	And it's not, you know, the portable ops.
2050783	2051523	It's not acid.
2051663	2054665	It's freaking solid.
2055865	2056526	Solid.
2056946	2057686	It's a solid game.
2058307	2061788	Now, one thing that didn't make our show roll tonight is about the Kojima countdowns that have been going on.
2061808	2065190	Because, you know, stories about countdowns are getting a little old here on Horizons Radio.
2065270	2070293	But, I mean, if this is what it is building up towards... I think it's building up to multiple things, actually.
2070333	2073495	I think that the countdown's building up to three different announcements.
2074375	2079239	One being a Raiden Metal Gear Solid game, which is probably going to be for the PS3.
2079279	2086385	The other being this probably Metal Gear Solid game based off of kind of the timeline of Metal Gear Solid 3, you know, with Big Boss.
2086885	2094632	And also, I think, that game Mask, which looks like a survivor horror game that he was supposed to be working on, a survivor horror game.
2095332	2097314	Another survival horror from Konami?
2097674	2099035	I mean, that would be their third.
2100096	2100556	That's big.
2100596	2102438	Behind Silent Hill, Saw, and now this?
2102698	2102998	Really?
2103499	2103679	Yeah.
2104528	2105108	Interesting.
2105549	2111052	Well, it was supposed to be a zombie, like, you know, Left 4 Dead type of game, but still Survivor Horror.
2112173	2114434	Oh, so like maybe more action-y than what we're used to.
2114514	2116936	I don't know, but it's a creepy picture that they have, so.
2118477	2121719	DarkTetsuya seems to agree with you, says in chat, you know, Loki's probably right.
2123900	2125581	You might want to be careful when you say things like that.
2126061	2126822	Don't let it get to his head.
2128598	2131000	All right, I'm curious, chat room, what do you guys think?
2131140	2132922	Do you think Loki's right?
2132942	2135604	Do you think it means three different games could possibly be on their way?
2136204	2148294	Or this could be the E3 of nothing but Metal Gear, which would kind of make sense a little bit because we haven't heard a lot coming out of Konami's camp.
2149195	2154139	We'll have more later on, and I'm sure they're going to be showcasing the Saw game and some of their music games.
2154960	2155761	But what else?
2156397	2160099	They've also got that other... There wasn't a lot that came out of their Gamers Day.
2160119	2164642	Well, there was that one that looked like Castlevania, but it wasn't Castlevania, which I don't remember the hell that game was called.
2166303	2167903	But we were supposed to be talking about it last week.
2168044	2178089	And then there was also... You know, their music games saw Silent Hill, the new one that's Shattered Memories or whatever that was.
2178549	2179230	Oh, yeah, the Wii one.
2179250	2179490	Silent Hill.
2180884	2182044	Which actually looks really cool.
2182184	2188027	It's apparently different each time you play it, depending on how you answer their personality profile thing.
2189628	2191229	It's like the eHarmony of Survivor Horror.
2192190	2192710	Oh, hooray.
2193050	2195011	You better hurry up and trademark that.
2195091	2198193	I hope it doesn't reject me for being a fag, just like eHarmony would.
2200074	2202195	I'll just put a gay bar where the bar normally goes.
2205017	2208080	No, and then they have some other game.
2208120	2209662	It's like tornadoes.
2210162	2211944	It'll make all the zombies just want to dance.
2214206	2214827	That's horrible.
2217089	2218891	Prop 8 will attack you instead of...
2222995	2224355	Prop 8 will kick me in the face.
2225116	2225716	That's what I'll get.
2225976	2228337	There's way too much gay going on the show right now.
2229798	2232419	They've got stuff that haven't been announced yet.
2232499	2236841	Tornado Outbreak was the other game, which is coming out in September.
2237801	2240883	Don't know what the hell it is, but it's a game from Konami.
2242984	2243904	It has tornadoes in it.
2245725	2246825	It's like tornadoes.
2250416	2252858	Sony doesn't just make PlayStations and PSPs.
2279714	2283257	You'll actually be able to use Remote Play to access your PlayStation 3.
2284257	2288260	And here's the thing, the device has 3G on it, so here's the deal.
2288540	2296346	When you get on this, you can use the 3G to stream movies, images, music from your PlayStation 3 hard drive.
2297066	2297727	Isn't that kind of neat?
2297747	2302310	Yeah, so if you have porn saved on your drive, you could have that anywhere, streaming over 3G.
2302610	2304592	What a waste of our bandwidth.
2304652	2305572	Porn anywhere?
2305893	2307113	Wow, that sounds like the internet.
2307974	2309015	Oh, wait, it is the internet.
2310882	2311983	Well, here's the other deal.
2312043	2314166	In Europe, you can get Play TV.
2314546	2318791	You'll be able to view, rewind, pause, whatever live television.
2319091	2322375	And you can also record it while you're on the go, the way the mobile phone is.
2322755	2324977	That's technology we've never seen before.
2325258	2330804	So if you forget, like, oh crap, I was supposed to record Grey's Anatomy or whatever, you can set it from your phone, I guess.
2331564	2346155	Keep in mind, though, for the most part, cell phones in Japan have been just decades ahead of what we've had here for the longest time until we started trickling out with trios and BlackBerrys and finally the iPhone.
2347856	2350438	And now we have all these apps for iPhones that will do all this crap for us.
2350958	2353020	But still, I mean...
2354389	2356771	This is probably really nothing major.
2356811	2358413	This is expected probably.
2358673	2362156	Yeah, I don't think the Sony I know has a shaking baby application.
2362656	2363677	That's something that's missing.
2363717	2364918	The iPhone does not have it anymore.
2365019	2365679	Not anymore?
2365939	2368281	They don't have the cocaine application anymore either.
2368462	2369883	There was a cocaine application?
2369903	2373066	You could sort the thing and then... It's a hell of a drug.
2373706	2376168	We actually talked about it in my typography class.
2376348	2376829	Wow.
2377750	2379491	How is that relevant to typography?
2379812	2381173	Do you make letters out of the coke?
2382881	2386128	I know a lot of... Were some of the best fonts designed?
2386208	2387170	Never mind.
2387231	2390518	Some of the best fonts were designed by lots of people who were on lots of stuff.
2392913	2393213	Alright.
2395134	2395574	Let's see.
2396514	2399775	Ranma says, so grab your dick and double click for porn, porn, porn.
2400635	2402715	GameGuru says, why would I TiVo Grey's Anatomy?
2402815	2403196	I don't know.
2403316	2404196	Obviously someone is.
2404256	2405076	The show's still on.
2405116	2405596	Exactly.
2405616	2407036	You'd have to watch it live.
2408037	2411397	Misty says, no, the internet is for OLR, which is the gateway to porn.
2411477	2412338	Get it right, GameGuru.
2412478	2412898	Oh, sorry.
2414861	2418102	Dark Shy says 3G coverage isn't exactly everywhere, is it?
2418162	2420303	I saw a map of 3G coverage for the newest iPhone.
2420744	2432289	I don't think it's everywhere, but for the big city people, like I don't know where you live, but I can tell you living here in Sacramento and the places I go the most are San Francisco, LA, you know, the places I drive.
2432409	2439893	I don't ever lose 3G unless I'm in like the basement of a building or behind, you know, solid walls where the signal can't reach and I'll go on edge.
2440053	2441114	Like I get 3G everywhere.
2441454	2447697	Well, I, and to be perfectly honest, you don't even need 3G, really, to get good signal in a major city.
2448537	2448737	Yeah.
2448757	2451078	To be perfectly honest, I've never wanted it.
2451379	2455460	I mean, I know I've heard a lot of complaints about AT&T and their coverage, but it's been fine for me.
2455600	2457861	Very, very rare do I not have 3G.
2458722	2459802	So, I don't know, maybe I'm just lucky.
2459842	2460303	Now they have 4G.
2461816	2462917	Yeah, I know.
2462937	2464557	Freaking Apple.
2464677	2471220	Did you hear about this rumor about the dormant video thing that's been in everybody's phone the whole time that they're finally going to turn on with iPhone 3.0?
2472001	2472621	Boy, oh boy.
2472641	2475743	You mean the thing that there's been homebrew apps that have already been doing it?
2475963	2476663	Yeah, that.
2478191	2478471	DarkSakura
2500902	2507806	Well, something that I've been particularly looking forward to and I'm glad finally has somewhat of a date is Star Trek Online.
2508226	2510667	Because I want my own ship, damn it.
2512528	2514909	And I would like to throw Tribbles at DarkSakura.
2516410	2517311	As long as you don't feed them.
2517871	2519692	Remember, if you feed them, then they breed.
2521193	2527056	I have, by the way, had the most Tribble-tastic week because I think I've watched Trials and Tribblations like four times this last week.
2527796	2528016	Nerd.
2528076	2529217	And Trouble with Tribbles once.
2530748	2537998	and then we tried to watch the animated episode and then the people watching it with me complained about the bad animation quality I swear I didn't mean to derail your story
2540807	2566322	anyway, according to one of Atari's financial documents it says that they expect Star Trek Online to be out no later than March 31st, 2010 and it will be both console and PC, according to the document nothing official from Cryptic yet but I'm sure that we should see something soon
2569159	2596731	I want to play I know, talk about the game that will make me leave any MMO I'm playing wherever my fickle ass is at the moment World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI, Hell Ragnarok I don't know, maybe I'll get into EVE before this is all over I'm going to Star Trek Online the minute this comes out I need to make the Oelarians I will be putting official data out for what these specs are to make an Oelarian and I want nothing but, I want to captain my own ship of nothing but redshirt people
2597731	2600293	You can't because you have to have command people.
2600453	2600753	Damn it!
2601954	2602655	You have to have doctors.
2603355	2607178	So if you think the MMO talk is bad now, just wait until this game comes out.
2607298	2608819	Wait to see how nerdy we all get.
2609479	2616444	Again, and I say this every time, and I'm going to say it every time, every week, every time this game gets brought up, I'm going to say this.
2617225	2618506	This game better not suck.
2620000	2622641	Star Trek has so much momentum going for it right now.
2623001	2623622	Please.
2624022	2626083	There will be riots in the streets.
2626143	2626723	It will be me.
2628124	2629145	It'll just be Rob.
2629185	2631045	He'll be out there going, riot!
2631065	2632266	And maybe DarkSakura.
2632466	2635608	I will throw a Slurpee against a window of a 7-Eleven.
2635628	2637909	That'll be my riot.
2638489	2640210	I will be pissed if this game sucks.
2641010	2642271	And we'll put it on YouTube or something.
2642311	2646273	You know, as the classic line from the movie goes, better to be pissed off than pissed on.
2647768	2650890	Ranma says, Sky will request a pink starship with sparkles.
2651190	2651530	No.
2652670	2653031	No.
2653671	2656492	You're freaking like stereotyping or something?
2656632	2658633	No, I do not want a pink starship with sparkles.
2659053	2661034	I want a purple starship with sparkles, ass.
2661775	2664396	And Stick Axe asks, what if the game sucks, Rob?
2664676	2665356	Well, you heard me.
2665457	2665757	Riot.
2666497	2668218	Then we take to the streets.
2669414	2672156	Then we protest in front of Atari.
2672596	2676579	We get all the people at Cryptic and we It'll be a dual protest.
2676759	2682524	One side of the sign will say overturn Prop 8 and the other side will say remake Star Trek because this version sucks.
2683504	2691270	And then we subject the people at Cryptic that are in charge of that to investigation by special means.
2692551	2692831	Alright.
2693092	2694112	By probing.
2695133	2695613	That's right.
2696514	2696894	There you go.
2696914	2697455	There's the answer.
2697475	2698896	If this game sucks, anal probes.
2699326	2699747	Exactly.
2701248	2701629	All right.
2701909	2707115	And I'll tell you what, just for that, I'm putting a model of the Enterprise in my home.
2707535	2713102	Let's probe around the world right now and look at the upcoming release dates for upcoming games.
2713410	2716995	Hey listen, I'm sorry every time you say that the Metallica song pops into my head.
2730699	2734121	Give me fuel, give me fire, give me that which I desire I like how you said that, it's kind of eh
2756676	2757957	Okay, but other things coming out.
2758077	2761281	Age of Pirates 2, City of Abandon on PC.
2761301	2763203	Arr, it's abandoned.
2766043	2771968	Crazy Chicken Atlantis Quest on DS Fuck these games, weren't there like three of them last week?
2772749	2788443	Crazy Chicken Star Carts on DS These are probably the same games from last week, they just never came out Gee, I wonder why Crazy Chicken Pharaoh's Treasure on DS Yes, Mumbo Jumbo doesn't know anything about hitting dates as far as releases go
2789724	2793489	Red Faction Guerrilla coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3.
2793529	2794650	That game looks awesome.
2795110	2797693	The main feature, I guess, was explosions.
2798114	2798775	Can't go wrong there.
2799295	2801217	It's on Mars.
2801378	2807665	If any of these Crazy Chicken games are actually good games, I will eat a cup of mayonnaise.
2808145	2809126	And anyone who knows me...
2809767	2810087	and DarkSakura.
2829238	2830139	Oh, well, even better.
2830919	2841286	No disrespect to whatever they like over there in the UK, but then you're basically just telling me, oh, on top of already thinking these games are going to suck, you're telling me they're licensed games off of TV and movie properties.
2841586	2842907	How often are those games any good?
2843508	2843888	They're not.
2846610	2850193	Night's in the Nightmare on DS, coming from Atlus.
2851053	2860160	And then, of course, one of the bigger titles of the week, Sims 3, coming out on PC, also available in a collector's edition, where you get a bunch of useless crap.
2861741	2869627	And then the game with the longest title of the week, and I don't know why, but Johnny Bravo and the Huckamega Mighty Ultra Extreme Datorama.
2870047	2872890	Yes, the title may be long, but the game still sucks.
2876503	2892537	and then of course we've got some other fun stuff more party games from Majesco go play Lumberjacks with Lumberjack themed games and go play Circus Star where you can play as a circus performer is it a Lumberjack and it's okay?
2894468	2913297	and then Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad coming to the DS from Destineer and finally a week from today the legendary Starfy a game that apparently is a franchise in Japan I don't know anything about it and it looks stupid but that's just my dumb American opinion
2914868	2915689	Questions from chat.
2915749	2917210	Marissa is in chat.
2917230	2917731	Hi, Marissa.
2917771	2920032	Marissa Congusto asks, No, Rob, not Mayo.
2920072	2920673	Don't do it.
2921694	2922134	You know what?
2922234	2925377	I'm that confident that I'm right, so I'm not even worried about it.
2925477	2930821	It's just like Loki doing the bet on Eye of Judgment, the legendary bet that people still haven't shut up about two years later.
2931481	2933363	He was that confident in it, and you know what?
2933403	2933903	He was right.
2935220	2938602	Stick Axe asks, how would we determine whether they're any good, Rob?
2938622	2941063	Would it be that the games have a Metacritic score above a certain amount?
2941443	2943924	I suppose, but honestly, you've been listening to this show long enough.
2943964	2944584	You can trust me.
2944704	2946165	If the games are good, I will tell you.
2946545	2947746	And we will do it.
2948326	2954949	And if you don't believe me, you think I'm lying, we can agree upon a non-discriminatory panel or something.
2955049	2955489	I don't know.
2955589	2957931	But I'm that confident these games are no good.
2958271	2958631	Come on.
2959371	2960512	Games like this are a dime a dozen.
2961830	2963993	Do you really think there's a chance in hell I'm eating the mayonnaise?
2964253	2965654	Hell no, otherwise I wouldn't have said it.
2967456	2968778	Are you looking it up on Metacritic right now?
2968798	2976987	Okay, this has got to go then on the official stuff, ongoing bets on the show.
2978240	2981342	You know, I think this game is so awesome, it's not even on there.
2981462	2982263	Oh, wait, here we go.
2982303	2984204	Here's the last one that came out on DS.
2984564	2990288	Chicken Hunter, which is also the same franchise, they just changed the name, got a Metacritic rating of 39.
2991129	2993870	That's quality right there.
2994051	2995051	There you go, exactly.
2995071	2996252	I have nothing to worry about.
2996292	2998454	You could probably go off Metacritic and I'd be just fine.
2998834	3002836	Hey, let's talk about something interesting, and that is the Japanese release date.
3002856	3006919	Although I do like Marissa's idea of making it Bacon-A's to make it a little easier on me.
3006939	3008000	Bacon-A's is great.
3008520	3012502	So if I do... I do want to put that clause in the contract, just in case.
3013222	3019105	The cup of mayonnaise do be Bacon A's, and I think everybody would agree, just for my own sanity and well-being, that would be the way to do it.
3019265	3019545	Thank you.
3022066	3024667	I will end up in the hospital again with pancreatitis if I lose this bet.
3024707	3025108	Just wait.
3025788	3028869	Anyway... That's why we'll get you some fat-free mayonnaise.
3028909	3029129	Yeah.
3029430	3030530	Fat-free Bacon A's?
3030570	3031030	Good luck.
3031390	3032771	They're gonna have to, like, invent it.
3033191	3036653	Alright, on the Xbox 360, I'm gonna have to fucking eat...
3038624	3046948	Miracle Whip on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
3047748	3048289	Nothing.
3048309	3052151	It is completely empty until June 25th.
3052171	3054712	There is like nothing on the calendar right now for the Xbox 360.
3055032	3056993	It's pretty boring right now over in Japan.
3057433	3058874	Just not a busy time of year for them.
3058974	3061894	PlayStation 3 really doesn't look much different, I have to be honest.
3062175	3063435	It's a very slow week over there.
3064375	3066396	Moving on, however, to the Nintendo Wii.
3066436	3070577	At least you get Ark Rise Fantasia comes out in Japan from Marvelous.
3070857	3072058	That comes out on the Wii this week.
3072098	3074158	That's really the only release to look forward to there.
3074919	3078980	And taking a look at the PlayStation 2, Evangelion Joe comes out there.
3079100	3079420	What?
3079620	3080580	More Eva games?
3080660	3081621	Of course, of course.
3081661	3082461	There's just no other...
3083979	3085199	No other way to do it over there.
3085279	3087400	And on the Nintendo DS, you have a few more options.
3087440	3093762	You have Kotowari Sahai Simulation, Ochanoma Pro Yaku DS is the name of that game.
3094082	3095702	I'm not sure what exactly you're simulating.
3095883	3097143	Oh, it looks like baseball.
3097163	3098363	It looks like a baseball coach game.
3100604	3101104	So there you go.
3102264	3106066	Looking really quick on the PSP to see if there's anything of interest there, although I highly doubt it.
3106186	3108666	Oh, you get a port of that same Evangelion game on the PSP.
3109106	3109707	And that's really it.
3109987	3110687	Kids like Ava.
3111269	3111711	That's right.
3111891	3113256	That's really it for Japanese releases.
3113296	3114640	Kind of a slow week for them.
3115282	3117930	Well, how about we go overseas in another direction?
3118854	3122495	Here's stuff that is coming out in UK.
3123115	3126295	We have on the 5th actually a bunch of releases.
3127375	3128356	At least a handful anyway.
3129076	3131856	New Play Control Donkey Kong Jungle Beat on Wii.
3133256	3136337	Red Faction Guerrilla on Xbox 360 and PS3.
3136997	3140378	Sacred 2 Fallen Angel on Xbox 360 and PS3.
3141078	3143858	Star Ocean The Last Hope on Xbox 360.
3144558	3147359	Walk With Me Do You Know Your Walking Routine on DS.
3148510	3149652	No, I forgot how to walk.
3150734	3151555	It's your walking routine.
3151595	3153999	Left, right, left, right, left, right.
3154019	3156403	So do I get to make a walking dance routine or something?
3157084	3159508	It's scheduling your walks, I guess.
3159749	3160169	I guess.
3160450	3162934	And then Sims 3, of course, which, yay!
3164178	3165620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3186661	3188141	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3212285	3213086	All right.
3213106	3214187	You've built this live on air.
3214207	3215768	You started from scratch at the beginning of the night?
3215788	3217650	No, I didn't start on... I actually started it last night.
3218070	3219251	Oh, I thought you did the whole thing on air tonight.
3219271	3219972	Here's my entire house.
3220872	3221693	See, there's my potty.
3222714	3222814	Oh.
3223134	3223995	And there's the upstairs.
3224315	3224896	All right, anyhow.
3225096	3225997	This is horrible radio.
3226037	3226617	They can't see it.
3226837	3227958	I'll put pictures up eventually.
3228198	3228419	All right.
3229099	3230420	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
3230460	3233022	We will get into the classic game of the week and our break tonight pretty soon.
3233062	3236145	We still have about ten more stories to go over, so, Loki, we better get to it.
3237026	3237266	Ha ha.
3237856	3238857	Sorry, I'm looking at a picture.
3238937	3239278	It's funny.
3240699	3243983	DJ Hero, a game that we've been talking about for quite a while now.
3244243	3245625	Lots of stuff coming out this week.
3246005	3247787	Especially game trailers ran.
3248007	3251291	An exclusive E3 trailer that they put out.
3251631	3252752	Showing some of the gameplay.
3254494	3258375	Which is not surprising, you know, it looks very much how they described it in the magazine.
3258915	3260136	But we've got some more details now.
3260176	3273619	They're going to have a few different versus modes, including DJ versus DJ, DJ plus DJ, you know, like a co-op, or DJ plus guitar, you know, for the 10 tracks that they have, you know, guitar support for.
3274559	3278300	And, of course, you know, the game's going to be coming out on all platforms, rumored to be $120.
3278340	3279201	That's kind of expensive, and...
3285222	3292304	Also, they're going to be having a limited edition pack coming out that's going to be tying in with Jay-Z and Eminem.
3292784	3304528	Apparently, it's going to come with an advanced version of the controller, a DJ stand, a metal traveling case, and also the greatest hit CDs from both rappers.
3306249	3307869	And sadly enough, I want to get that.
3308730	3312491	Not because I'm fans of them, but because I like the idea of, you know...
3313382	3338350	a DJ stand and a metal traveling case that would be all sorts of nerdy cool this is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3 I want to see how they're pulling this off because I love the concept I was a little nervous when I first heard they were making this game but everything I'm hearing I love the idea of the songs all being mashups everything sounds good but it's all in the execution this is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3 same here
3339932	3340752	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3366542	3368663	Well, our chat room is lighting up right now with comparisons.
3368703	3371886	Of course, whenever it seems like the DJ games get brought up, 2DX gets brought up.
3372586	3377369	Interesting enough, the next story I have has to do with Bomani and what could possibly be next in the U.S.
3377729	3381572	It's about another music series, not Beatmania, but Poppin' Music.
3381952	3385074	Now, you might remember we all declared Poppin' Music dead in the U.S.
3385675	3387696	when Beat and Groovy crashed and burned.
3387716	3389357	Remember that one on Xbox Live Marketplace?
3389577	3389877	Oh, my God.
3389897	3390418	Damn it, Rob.
3390438	3390978	I've been trying
3390998	3391758	I'm trying to forget about that.
3411249	3412409	Thank you for watching!
3436374	3437115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3453254	3453855	Thanks for watching!
3479258	3482241	The 9 configuration without having to release a new controller.
3482561	3483101	No idea.
3483401	3484082	This could be very interesting.
3484102	3487004	They're not going to put in freestyle mode or anything, are they?
3487865	3488285	No idea.
3488606	3491368	Some people are saying maybe it's like a pop and music adventure kind of game.
3492229	3492549	I don't know.
3492569	3494550	Which is, I guess, a spin-off series that happened in Japan.
3494590	3495611	I'm not as familiar with it.
3495972	3499414	Despite all the bumani I do know about, I'm not as familiar with the adventure series.
3499875	3502317	But apparently the game is coming out August 6th.
3502597	3507221	So if there is an American version of this coming out, which the trademark would lead you to believe, we might see it at E3.
3507261	3508682	That would be very interesting.
3510987	3511868	That's just bizarre.
3512088	3512849	Yeah, very bizarre.
3513129	3513489	Who knows?
3513569	3515691	More to come on this probably this next week.
3515711	3516052	We'll see.
3517013	3520596	Well, I do have sad news for the five people still playing Matrix Online.
3521777	3522497	All five of you.
3522978	3523659	I'm counting you.
3524940	3526581	Well, you're SOL now.
3527642	3529544	It's actually...
3530919	3531280	You know what?
3532421	3533062	I picked the wrong thing.
3533783	3535005	Oh, that's... No, yeah, I did.
3535426	3535666	Sorry.
3536467	3537429	I did pick the right thing.
3539872	3540153	Oops!
3540533	3541194	Live radio.
3542075	3543157	These things happen sometimes.
3543618	3544479	Why don't you start it from the top?
3546292	3551657	Well, for the five people who are still playing this, sorry guys.
3552117	3553978	Sony hates you.
3555079	3556120	They really do hate you.
3558082	3562045	Actually, Sony of Europe is pulling Matrix Online.
3562265	3563566	It is being shut down.
3565088	3567049	I'm sorry, why did I say Sony of Europe?
3567750	3571813	Sony Online Entertainment will be closing it down on July 31st.
3571953	3574716	You better get in your Matrix-ing while you can.
3575516	3577197	and then prepare to swallow your blue pill.
3579017	3580198	Before somebody unplugs you.
3580478	3580998	You're done.
3582078	3582539	No more.
3582979	3584379	Wait for private servers to pop up.
3584859	3585740	I'm not surprised.
3586300	3587000	Me neither.
3587040	3587921	I really didn't realize.
3587941	3589861	I actually thought it ended a long time ago.
3590241	3592542	Didn't they do the end of the world event or something in there?
3592682	3593443	That was a beta.
3593903	3596404	Oh, I thought the damn thing was done a long time ago.
3597064	3598965	I thought so too, but I think that was just the beta.
3599685	3599905	Yeah.
3600370	3611499	Actually, it was Ben Chamberlain, who was the designer and GM, was the one doing all the content updates, the one keeping everything alive, and then he left.
3612380	3619226	So, basically, they're going to be doing some sort of monumental end of the world thing, and then that's it.
3619711	3622114	The exact same thing they did for the beta.
3622234	3623215	I'm kind of curious here.
3623335	3626779	Gold Anthro is in chat and apparently is somewhat of a fan of the Matrix Online.
3626799	3628521	Says, I was following the story of that.
3628862	3630784	They could at least finish the story properly.
3630844	3634007	Maybe make a second Animatrix collection based on the events of the MMO.
3634708	3636811	But Jamie, a lot of fun of that game is the story.
3636891	3638793	That's why I followed it and tried the free trial.
3639133	3641515	So, another opinion from chat.orangeentree.com.
3641836	3656549	I mean, for hardcore fans of The Matrix, to be fair, as much as we're teasing the game because the game itself didn't look to be a lot of fun, at least when I saw Loki playing it a long time ago, it was, for fans of The Matrix, they were continually building in that universe.
3656569	3657690	They were continuing the story.
3658051	3663355	Didn't they kill off one of the major characters from the movie, like, in the game or something?
3663376	3663456	Yeah.
3664978	3665739	I don't remember.
3665779	3667259	I'm just kind of asking that out loud.
3667299	3668860	I'm sure I'd get a response from Jack.
3668900	3669100	Really?
3669280	3672521	I didn't keep up with it enough to notice.
3672561	3672901	Thank you.
3672981	3674622	Morpheus apparently allegedly died.
3674642	3675962	I thought one of the main characters there.
3676182	3677483	Well, who misses him?
3677683	3681744	Chat.HornslawnTrader.com Well, if you're a fan of the Matrix series, then you might.
3683145	3690147	Alright, well, we'll see if any pirate servers pop up or what game these fans plan to go to, if anything.
3692035	3698038	And as the Matrix Online dies, another thing comes back from the dead.
3698058	3705663	EGM actually is back now, to the praise of many of its fans.
3706763	3715489	Apparently EGM was sold to its original founder, and he's planning on starting a publication in print and as well as online.
3716329	3727834	and no word yet if any of the staff members that were fired back when UGO bought up the 1UP brand, if they're going to somehow bring those people back.
3727914	3729375	Maybe some people will return back.
3729415	3730155	I'm sure if they're asked.
3730656	3736358	But they have an exciting plan for taking this magazine to the next evolution, they say.
3737919	3739980	It's interesting, though, because that was actually a pretty good magazine.
3740120	3741661	With it gone, it's pretty much just...
3742762	3746746	Game Informer, which isn't bad.
3747026	3756756	You know, is there a lot, now an interesting question is playing devil's advocate here, especially in this economy, in this world we live in, with the internet and everything, is there a demand for print publication?
3756977	3759760	I think, well, I mean, like, Game Informer's pretty good.
3759780	3761021	You know, I'd
3761687	3768772	I wouldn't probably voluntarily sign up for it unless I get the discount cards through GameStop and that's really the only incentive.
3769413	3781501	But they've had a lot of exclusive stories lately and probably because they're GameStop and can afford to say, hey, give us the exclusive story on this or we won't buy as much.
3782022	3782602	That type of stuff.
3783303	3783463	So...
3784773	3812815	which has to violate some type of antitrust law just by the way or it could be the other way around it could be that they're giving them that because they're like hey look at our user base for this magazine is huge and yeah it is huge because you get it when you sign up for this card that basically pays for itself pretty quick I don't know it's not bad but still I think there is room for more gaming publications out there I mean hell EGM hasn't even gone that long
3814093	3815053	Rob, you're such a goof.
3841328	3841969	So there you go.
3842230	3844193	EGM, coming soon to a bathroom near you.
3846938	3850424	Hey, hopefully not going to end up in your bathroom but in your console.
3850904	3851505	Squeenix!
3852952	3856493	has a brand new... Believe it or not, it's not Final Fantasy XIV.
3856553	3858314	It's not Kingdom Hearts XI.
3858754	3860274	It is a brand new franchise.
3860334	3862275	It's something called N.I.E.R.
3862355	3862575	Nier.
3862875	3867156	Although that might be a little bit deceptive because I guess it's like a new type of front mission game.
3867856	3868476	No, no.
3868917	3870897	There's two different games.
3871577	3872578	Okay, so N.I.E.R.
3872658	3875738	Nier is one of the... It's a hack and slash action game.
3875778	3876679	It looks fucking awesome.
3876899	3877159	Really?
3877259	3879179	I didn't look at the videos of this yet.
3879199	3879940	What's it kind of look like?
3880540	3880680	Um...
3881501	3881944	I don't know.
3882649	3883615	It's really like...
3885609	3887090	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3915649	3916489	Oh, that's tough.
3917530	3923512	By the way, just kind of on a side note, this is a Final Fantasy and the PSP bundle that will be coming with it August 25th.
3923592	3931034	Yeah, new Front Mission game that's coming out is going to be a little bit different because you remember Front Mission is more of a tactical strategy game, whereas this one's going to be like Armored Core.
3931655	3935596	It's just, you know, get mech, kill things, which I can get behind that.
3936036	3938838	Shadow Next Gen in chat says, I want Kingdom Hearts 3, damn it.
3938878	3939379	You know what?
3939419	3939819	Me too.
3940059	3946764	I know they have these spin-off games coming this year, and sadly, I think that's all we're going to get is the DS and PSP Kingdom Hearts games.
3946784	3949206	I think the ones that are coming out in Japan are going to come here too, inevitably.
3949526	3950207	But you know what?
3950587	3960274	Disney has a huge booth at E3 this year, and granted, I know they have all their little Hannah Montana and whatever type games that they do, which is probably in reality all you're going to see there.
3961095	3967377	There's a part of me that just really hopes maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 is a surprise announcement.
3967597	3968878	At least something.
3969058	3970378	Throw me a freaking bone here.
3970558	3971879	Show me a new teaser trailer.
3972179	3976300	Give me something to look forward to in 2010 after Final Fantasy XIII is out.
3976900	3982962	I would hope if nothing else, if they do the whole Square Theater or whatever again, that we see a little bit of a tease of Kingdom Hearts 3.
3983122	3984903	Well, Square likes to tease games that aren't
3985483	3988204	And that's all I'm asking for.
3988524	3990065	Just let me know it's really happening.
3990425	3992746	Remind me that Kingdom Hearts 3 is happening.
3993206	4000809	Remind me that you're not going to do this weird-ass spin-off that makes no sense to a seven-year-old like you were trying to show at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2.
4001950	4002890	Remember that ending?
4002910	4003791	That was awesome.
4003851	4006092	It was awesome, but what the fuck did it have to do with Disney?
4006332	4006652	Nothing.
4007572	4009753	What does Kingdom Hearts really have to do with Disney?
4009953	4011174	Not a lot, but damn it.
4011994	4012495	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4035066	4035906	I don't remember when it was.
4035926	4039787	I don't remember if it was this March or if it was the time before.
4040107	4044529	But we actually saw a little kid dressed up as Sora in the park in Haunted Mansion.
4044589	4045449	I thought I was with you.
4045729	4047529	We saw him in line for Haunted Mansion.
4047569	4048810	So sometimes you see it.
4048870	4050130	I don't know, but it's just random.
4050590	4053411	Because remember they were from Australia or something and the costume was really well done.
4053431	4055232	And then they asked him to leave.
4055592	4058212	No, they didn't ask him because you're allowed to be dressed up in the park if you're a kid.
4060498	4072687	Anyhow, I've ever seen one thing in the park, Kingdom Hearts related, one thing, official Disney in the park, and that was a California venture in the collectible store they were selling where they sell all the little mini statues.
4072888	4073608	I saw Sora.
4073828	4075850	That's the only thing I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related.
4075970	4076110	Really?
4076130	4077051	I haven't seen that at all.
4077151	4079973	Yes, and it was gone when I looked again this last time I was there.
4080333	4084837	So I guess it's kind of like Where's Waldo across two theme parks.
4084917	4085537	Where's Sora?
4085938	4086298	Good luck.
4087904	4088184	Anyhow.
4090166	4092107	More stories, if we could.
4092167	4092768	DarkSakura.
4093548	4101174	Well, as I mentioned, I believe it was last week, there was the rumor about Wolfenstein 3D coming out.
4102255	4105438	And it is going to be on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
4106899	4110301	It will be June 4th and June 5th, respectively.
4110341	4112303	That means Xbox fans, get it first!
4112763	4113344	Ha ha!
4113364	4114705	Bringing it home.
4115966	4116126	Huh?
4116496	4118378	That's part of the E3's Bring It Home.
4119119	4121201	Or, you know, where Microsoft does that Bring It Home thing.
4121661	4121882	Oh, okay.
4121902	4122442	They have demos.
4122783	4126787	I bet you anything we're going to see a Lost Planet 2 demo coming this week.
4127828	4129450	Since they said they were going to do that anyways.
4130651	4133113	Maybe I'll get some cool new shirts for my avatar.
4133174	4133814	Whoopty shit.
4134075	4136597	But there will be actually...
4138852	4141575	Of course, achievements, whatever you want to call it.
4142075	4151404	And also for the new Wolfenstein game, you can earn accolades and be awarded gold for customizable weapon upgrades for the new Wolfenstein.
4151424	4152165	So that'll be pretty cool.
4152185	4153627	And that, of course, is coming out on August 4th.
4154730	4155830	No idea on price yet.
4156330	4156670	Sorry.
4157191	4157651	I don't know.
4158451	4159171	Probably $10.
4159251	4160831	I want to shoot Hitler in the head.
4161832	4162232	It should be $5.
4162432	4164752	I want to shoot a giant pixelated Hitler.
4164952	4172274	I mean, Wolfenstein 3D, honestly, unless they did something really cool with this, which I heard about the whole integration with the new Wolfenstein or whatever.
4172294	4173234	I'm sorry, that's not enough.
4173834	4179256	Unless they did something really fucking cool, like suddenly put multiplayer in it somehow, which I doubt they did, I don't think it's worth it.
4179356	4179556	Yeah.
4180636	4183537	The game was not that great by today's standards.
4184037	4186778	Was it an important and revolutionary game at the time?
4187178	4187418	Yes.
4187478	4188938	But does it hold up to today's standards?
4189258	4190099	Hell the fuck no.
4190139	4192039	You are going to download this and be, why did I waste $10?
4192379	4193840	Remember Pub Games?
4194260	4194840	Fable 2?
4194920	4196480	Remember how that was going to integrate stuff?
4196500	4197781	Remember how crappy those were?
4197881	4198421	Yeah.
4198501	4199801	I'm not falling for that twice.
4200401	4200701	Sorry.
4201762	4202642	I'm going to get it.
4203743	4205504	I love- I freaking love Wolfenstein.
4205624	4208305	I love Doom, and I also love Duke Nukem 3D.
4208505	4210986	Bought both of those, played them for about- 30 minutes.
4211007	4212227	30 minutes, and then that was it.
4212307	4213428	And you're like, yay, nostalgia.
4213608	4214248	Okay, done now.
4215148	4216529	I will- I will bet money.
4216869	4219350	I will bet money DarkSakura does the same thing.
4220131	4221832	She'll buy it, play it for 30 minutes, and be done.
4222432	4223873	That is if I actually go through with buying it.
4227087	4228148	And it's nothing against her.
4228229	4230651	I'm just saying, it's the same thing, the same nostalgia bug.
4230671	4231712	I say that with crap anyway.
4231812	4234395	The same nostalgia bug that you and me.
4234415	4240841	Honestly, honestly, honestly, this is really what I'm going to do is probably just freaking download it and play it on my computer like, you know, God intended.
4242113	4244794	Marissa Conguso in chat says, anyone remember Heretic?
4245014	4246455	Hell yeah!
4246515	4247055	I'm sorry.
4247435	4249216	I was the big Hexen fan.
4249376	4254639	Now if that and Hexen come out on Xbox Live, we will play that for hours.
4254799	4255199	Guaranteed.
4255219	4257440	We will stream it on the internet to prove it.
4257480	4259341	I will go on leave from work and play it.
4259381	4262682	We will play like eight hours of that game on a weekend.
4262742	4263683	We will do it.
4263943	4265144	I will watch Rob do it too.
4268226	4268967	Gee, thanks.
4269107	4269927	You're a real pal.
4270288	4271669	No, I'd play.
4271849	4272229	I'd do it.
4272349	4276492	All right, good, because I might want to sleep at some point or eat, I don't know, during those eight hours.
4276612	4277893	You're not allowed to eat anymore, Rob.
4277973	4281476	If you release, what, Heretic or Hexen or both or which one?
4283877	4284638	You should do a pack.
4285066	4286327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4307393	4313055	There are too many bets being made tonight, and I'm really afraid the public is going to win one of them.
4313796	4314976	You know what, Rob?
4315056	4316557	My thought is on bets.
4317137	4319358	I never intend on going through with them, so why?
4320098	4321019	You're a bad bet maker.
4321119	4324060	I fully intended on going through with the Eye of Judgment thing.
4324120	4332664	If somebody says, hey, we heard about this bet, we just sold another 750,000 copies of it, which will never happen, but if it did...
4333257	4334798	Then yes, I would go through with the bet.
4334858	4337800	He wouldn't have half-assed it either.
4338460	4341022	The wife would have made the costume.
4341382	4342323	It would have been tremendous.
4342543	4345225	Things that could have been, but no, nobody had to buy Eye of Judgment.
4345425	4347286	We're even going to have him go through the happy tingle dance.
4347326	4350288	When Loki makes the bet, he makes the damn bet.
4350649	4351689	I will say this.
4351849	4354471	I've done this show with Loki a long time, known the man many years.
4354731	4355552	He is a man of his word.
4357033	4360195	And God forbid they try to make a sequel and no...
4361806	4362626	I don't think I will.
4363087	4364527	We'll have to look at it.
4364567	4365808	Yeah, it depends.
4365908	4369009	Don't say anything until you see it because the sequel could be cool if there is one.
4369429	4371170	So you want to watch it, Loki.
4371550	4371890	Watch it.
4373593	4377014	Something that probably will be cool, but I won't be picking it up.
4377394	4377954	Guitar Hero 5.
4378294	4381874	It will be coming out a little bit earlier this year, September 1st.
4382375	4388716	And of course, new to Guitar Hero 5 will be a new party play mode where you can mix up what instruments you have.
4390216	4394497	And also, I think drop in and drop out play as well, which is kind of sweet.
4395337	4400238	And there's also a full confirmation of all the artists that will be featured in the game.
4400938	4401058	And...
4402658	4404019	Blur, Blink-182, Iron Maiden Duran Duran, Tom Petty
4430049	4451825	Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, David Bowie, Johnny Cash One that made me excited, Rammstein Beck, Garbage, Billy Idol Finally, one that made me perk up, I love Garbage Queen and David Bowie That means we're getting under pressure Probably
4453553	4455455	I just bought Guitar Hero 5, son of a bitch.
4456336	4457057	Son of a bitch.
4457157	4459800	That's like the one song I have to have.
4460640	4461281	You all know it.
4461441	4464825	You out there listening, you know there is that one song you have to have.
4464865	4469830	If you haven't already got it, there's that one song you have to have that's going to make you buy the game regardless.
4470430	4471071	And he just said it.
4471411	4472372	Elton John.
4473153	4475115	Oh man, there's like...
4477304	4478545	I don't know, it looks pretty cool.
4478765	4479925	And Deep Purple.
4480285	4481546	Maybe we'll get Highway Star in there again.
4481566	4483026	I love Highway Star.
4484287	4485007	Alright, sweet.
4485107	4486888	And that's just a selection of some of the stuff there.
4486908	4488229	But they have the full list that's out there now.
4488509	4492210	Apparently it was leaked out by a UK magazine.
4492290	4495772	I believe the UK equivalent to Rolling Stone or something.
4496832	4497673	Posted the full list.
4498053	4500374	But we'll hear more about Guitar Hero 5.
4500414	4502735	You'll actually get to see it in a few days.
4504139	4509345	All right, well, we got just a little more news for you, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week, and this has to do with Nintendo.
4509425	4511668	Now, the leaks aren't just kept to Sony.
4512008	4516093	Nintendo might have leaked some things out thanks to some trademarks they've been filing.
4516453	4519036	One of the trademarks that have been filed, Wii Fit Plus.
4519056	4519316	Boom!
4519336	4520177	Boom!
4520217	4520317	Boom!
4542176	4544037	WeFit Plus is a real deal.
4544417	4546758	WeMotion Plus is going to be supported.
4547038	4553520	That's a big part of this game, is that now they'll be able to detect the motion a little better, and it's going to have online functionality.
4553860	4555820	Very limited online functionality.
4555840	4560082	This is probably just sharing data across the internet so you can motivate each other, which is okay.
4560522	4563523	I mean, it's not something to buy the game over, but...
4563863	4565024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4586463	4587764	It's not a bad thing.
4588505	4591247	I gotta say, I'm very interested in Wii Fit Plus.
4591307	4594769	As embarrassed as I am to say it, I'm interested to see what they do with it.
4595370	4604636	I know, and that's kind of cool that they're putting out another game that some of these people that bought Wii Fit are gonna buy, but they just keep putting out sequels to games that they already have.
4604696	4609020	And yes, I know that everybody releases sequels, but my god, okay?
4609340	4610481	Seriously, let's see here.
4610541	4612002	Wii Sports Resort.
4612382	4616305	Wii Sports 2, basically, which has games that repeat themselves
4616545	4617386	Okay, hold up, though.
4617566	4622790	Isn't Wii Sports, like, if it's not the top-selling console game of all time at this point, one of the top?
4622850	4624151	Come on.
4624651	4625852	They've got to have a Wii Sports 2.
4626012	4627133	That may be true.
4627653	4634238	You know there's going to be a Mario, which, by the way, next part of the story, rumor is the Mario is the big unveiling at E3, the new Mario game.
4634478	4637100	Why aren't we seeing anything new, anything innovative?
4637140	4638841	It's basically just rehashes of...
4639782	4640122	Old stuff.
4640242	4642263	Because the rehashes are what people want to see.
4642283	4642803	Hey, guess what?
4642843	4646423	We could have had more motion sensors, but we were cheap and decided not to put it in there.
4646463	4657486	But hey, now if you buy this, buy more accessories that we're going to sell you now, you can buy the same game again with now some online functionality, which should have been in there in the first place.
4658166	4664047	And you can have some enhanced motion capturing that should have been in there in the first place.
4664987	4665567	Awesome!
4665787	4667528	I get to pay for your mistakes.
4668268	4668668	Again.
4668928	4671649	Oh, wait, no, I don't have to because I'm not buying it.
4672889	4675730	Comments from chat, chat.orangeandreta.com Tell us what you really feel.
4675790	4680831	Redertainment says, next year they'll have Wii Fit++ with Wii Motion+, Wii Vision+, and Wii Internet+.
4681331	4687652	Marissa Congusto says, I refer back to my old comment that video games are turning into porns with multiple sequels and endless sequel numbers.
4688513	4689873	Same content, different cast.
4691467	4694370	INGN0 The only non-Nintendo game that is good on the Wii is Mad World.
4704191	4729564	by the way one other thing I wanted to say one other game that was trademarked by Nintendo Art Academy so maybe that's something new question mark hope it's Mario Paint 2 that would be cool now okay well wait a minute you just said you didn't want to see sequels and now you're like give me Mario Paint 2 that would be new though okay that would be new they could do more innovative stuff with Mario Paint 2 now if they just put Mario Paint new Wii Control you know Mario Paint or whatever
4730104	4735188	with the Wii controls now to the old game, then yes, that would be rehashed crap.
4735228	4737309	But this is basically Wii Fit.
4737989	4740331	Maybe they'll have some different mini-games in there.
4741312	4741912	Whoopee!
4742873	4746575	And they're going to just throw it back at the consumer again.
4746655	4747155	And guess what?
4747556	4757622	The Nintendo consumer is dumb enough to buy this stuff again, and so the cycle will never end, and the people who actually want to play good games on the system will never get to play those good games.
4757662	4758243	So you know what?
4759124	4761526	You just have to move on, which I have.
4763628	4769013	Ranma in chat says, with all these motion controller adapters, it's just a matter of time before we see Masturbation the game.
4769454	4772456	And that is what we're hoping to see from the Korean developers at E3.
4772496	4777941	And damn it, if Masturbation the game is at E3, OLR will bring it to you, because no one else will.
4779303	4780664	No one else will want to.
4781805	4783707	No one else will want to touch it, literally.
4784807	4786268	Fanboy wank the game.
4787108	4789869	We did play 3 Feel that one time.
4790269	4794010	We extensively covered 3 Feel on this show.
4794211	4795871	And what the hell ever happened to that game?
4796211	4797412	That's what I love about E3.
4797452	4798372	I'll play all these games.
4798432	4799573	I will never fucking see again.
4799593	4804654	Whatever happened to that one game that was like a 360 game about some guy that was like Spring Break or something.
4804694	4806375	You can go on panty raids and stuff like that.
4806695	4808176	Remember, whatever happened to that?
4808196	4809096	I don't know.
4809116	4810157	You know what did come out?
4810337	4811257	Tulip came out.
4811417	4812739	Chulip did come out, finally.
4812799	4813579	The smooching game.
4813639	4814420	After like two years.
4814460	4815281	And Xtango.
4815482	4816723	Still no Xtango.
4816803	4818265	We need an Xtango.
4818325	4820187	I'm sorry, that game had so much potential.
4820207	4824992	We should go hunt these people down and go, why the hell haven't you released your game, you lazy bastard?
4825232	4827615	Give me some Xtango or I'll smack you down.
4827635	4828055	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4828075	4828576	Hold on, guys.
4828696	4828956	Hold on.
4829257	4829957	Serious moment here.
4830618	4838360	The reality of the situation is none of those games could get picked up because of the fact people are wanting their Mario 2s and people are wanting more of the same thing.
4839720	4841100	Serious, guys.
4841221	4843321	These games fizzled because they couldn't get the backing.
4843701	4845422	No, they could have put it on Xbox Live Arcade.
4845802	4846742	They could easily do that.
4846822	4847542	Or on XNA.
4848042	4849002	Well, define easily.
4849262	4850823	The money dries up at some point.
4850883	4851603	Who's paying for it?
4851623	4852283	The game's done.
4852363	4852983	Just port it.
4853703	4854724	They just need a distributor.
4854744	4855544	Somebody has to port it.
4856064	4857185	You have to pay someone to port it.
4857385	4859967	It's not just presto chango, it's on Xbox Live.
4860027	4862088	There's small game publishers out there that will do that.
4862329	4869914	I mean, there's people picking up rights to like M&M's and fucking Jelly Belly and stuff because they think that's an awesome IP.
4870114	4872036	Oh my god, it's recognizable, but no one wants to play the game.
4872056	4873477	Because people buy that shit.
4874637	4879381	I mean, if I put out a game that was like Nabisco something or other, I mean, no one's going to pick that up.
4880762	4882623	Lego my ego, you know, the game.
4882663	4884705	Nabisco presents Xtango.
4886195	4889218	I would play Nabisco Presents X-Tango.
4891319	4892540	Dancing for Oreos.
4893561	4894722	I would play Cookie Dancing.
4895583	4897505	Purina Dog Chow Presents.
4898105	4898646	Oh, great.
4899066	4899726	X-Alpo.
4900327	4903570	X-Alpo.
4904030	4906512	Anyways, I'm going to look and see what happened to Three Feel.
4907213	4908254	Will you do that during the break?
4908274	4909134	Will you try to research?
4909194	4913358	I want to find out what happened to Three Feel, X-Tango, and what was the other one?
4914998	4917642	Anything that we've talked about from the old Kensha Halls day.
4917662	4921587	Because it's been like three years since we've been doing E3 because we didn't get invited the hotel years.
4921807	4923089	So the years that don't count.
4923650	4923910	All right.
4924851	4927374	Look, we got the classic game of the week we got to get to.
4927595	4929738	We got to find out what's happened to some really old games.
4930378	4930859	Really old?
4932028	4941351	DarkSakura is going to dig through her archive of games and find a game to highlight just for you guys and what the heck is going on with it.
4941411	4942791	It's called the Classic Game of the Week.
4943091	4944692	Here it is here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4944712	4948153	What is the Classic Game of the Week that all the kids should be playing, DarkSakura?
4948813	4953114	The Classic Game of the Week is I'm actually going into the arcade archives.
4953634	4958055	Even though there were home releases of this, I'm going to really focus on the arcade version.
4958415	4959516	And that's a game called Starblade.
4961235	4970523	And yeah, I put up our customary, you know, audio thing, but there's really not a lot of music.
4970543	4972865	But for when it came out, it had some pretty good audio.
4972885	4974947	So this particular game was in a special pod cabinet.
4975328	4975368	Um...
4982874	4985536	Put out by Namco.
4986497	4991460	And it was running on the Namco System 21 hardware at the time.
4992221	4997865	This game came out when I think I was still in... Yeah, I was still in high school.
4997885	4999246	It came out in 1991.
5000127	5002428	And I was all over this game.
5002488	5004850	My dollar theater had it.
5005491	5008232	And the guys there used to put it on free play for me.
5009353	5011375	So I have beaten Starblade a number of times.
5012176	5019883	But the way that it goes is you have a really large 2-axis 4-button controller with an LED lamp.
5019983	5023587	So basically you flash it as you shoot them.
5024428	5033176	When you get hit, the seat rumbles and you get strobes going off so that it would be like...
5034116	5036058	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5057772	5061753	You are flying out through space and you're shooting all the bad guys.
5062573	5067435	They have big flashing red sections kind of like it did in Star Fox.
5068875	5071896	Basically you just go around and just shoot stuff.
5072416	5073136	It's a lot of fun.
5073196	5074256	It's a lot, a lot of fun.
5074576	5075897	Really kind of a difficult game too.
5078134	5078815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5098274	5099075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5128137	5129618	Galaxian 3 Project Dragoon
5147987	5149349	No, but I wanted to say really quick.
5151511	5154434	I can see this game's influence on Star Fox.
5154834	5157717	This game looks a lot like Star Fox to me.
5157757	5160139	It's a mix of Star Wars, the arcade game, and Star Fox.
5160500	5164444	I never played this game back in the day, but it looks a lot like it.
5164544	5168908	Just the graphics, the way things flash that you are supposed to target and kill.
5169288	5169489	Wow.
5169969	5180673	Well, Galaxian 3 is a walk-in style game that runs off a laser disc and the arcade hardware, so it has some pre-rendered stuff going on in the background.
5180693	5181893	It's super awesome, too.
5182133	5190036	But it was out for Namco's Theater 6 arcade system, which the only other game that came out was Attack of the Zulgir.
5192477	5198259	The cool thing about this, though, is that actually a lot of the audio from Starblade made it into Galaxian 3.
5198299	5209223	The path of the game is almost identical, you know, through the asteroid field with battleships, going through the planet, desert canyons, blah, blah, blah.
5209943	5212304	And the music in it was a rearrangement of Starblade.
5213459	5215840	So Starblade led directly to Galaxian 3.
5216900	5217800	It's a predecessor.
5223282	5228724	Also, do you know how Tekken 5 had their loading screens?
5228744	5229464	They had different games?
5230457	5256874	Starblade was in Tekken 5 so that always made me go someone in chat actually recognized that too and it was unlockable in the arcade history area of the game and Starblade also shows up in Ridge Racer 7 as a wheels manufacturer so it has wheels from the game there was supposed to be a sequel to it that was called Starblade Operation Blue Planet but the game never made production
5258928	5267377	It was supposed to be running on the Namco Orbs cabinet with a projector and a slide-in seat and everything.
5267397	5268538	It's supposed to be pretty neat.
5269359	5271802	But it never happened, which is a damn shame.
5272002	5272463	Bye.
5274205	5276347	But that's totally my game of the week.
5276835	5277756	All right, there you have it.
5277816	5282760	Your classic game of the week, Starblade, on the arcade.
5283040	5286542	I'm sorry, that's a game that still, I think, holds solid today.
5287003	5293207	It may look a little dated, but if you can find one in the cabinet, plunk the money into it, it's well worth it.
5293668	5294008	All right.
5294769	5296790	Very well-received pick by the chat room as well.
5296810	5298151	A lot of fans of that game in chat.
5298411	5301634	It is seriously, for arcade games, it's one of my favorites.
5302048	5302308	All right.
5302668	5304809	Well, we are going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5304869	5305910	I need to rest my voice.
5305930	5309852	I need to get some more tea or something hot to drink because you can hear I'm getting the whole puberty thing going on again.
5309872	5310792	I have tons of tea.
5310872	5311893	And we're going to rest a little bit.
5312033	5313233	Our voices take a quick break.
5313273	5316515	Come back in Part B. We haven't even touched Microsoft News yet.
5317035	5318076	And believe me, there's a lot of it.
5318096	5319216	So we're going to get to that after the break.
5319236	5320757	And, of course, your call is a little later on.
5321157	5322758	It's probably going to be a bit of a long show tonight.
5322798	5323938	So buckle up and hold on.
5324018	5326039	We'll get through it together, guys.
5326720	5329541	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5335649	5343817	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the 31st of 2009, where we are taping live on All Games Radio, as we do every Sunday night.
5344158	5353928	The fun begins around 6 o'clock Pacific, but sometimes we're on the phone with Bobby Blackwolf, the guy who goes before us with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and it will cause us to start a little late, as what happened tonight.
5354308	5355189	But that's okay.
5355309	5358532	We've still got plenty of stuff to talk to you guys about, so let's get right back into it.
5359173	5371361	enough BS hopefully you've already heard part A I don't know why you would I guess maybe if you're joining us late here live on this Sunday evening the shame on you for missing part A but you missed a lot about Sony and Nintendo now we're going to get into Microsoft news right Loki?
5371670	5375613	Yes, the rumored Zune HD is real.
5376053	5378495	Microsoft has now officially unveiled it.
5379255	5387481	And what it will do is also tie the Zune Marketplace into the Xbox 360, which is going to be pretty cool.
5388322	5396868	They're actually planning on mainly adding, I think, the music portion of the Zune Marketplace, perhaps showing you'll be able to...
5398590	5401933	Buy the Zune Pass and stuff like that so you can download songs.
5403034	5413243	Also, they're going to have maybe a different music service on top of that that's going to be similar to the Zune Marketplace for the 360, which is kind of cool.
5414404	5418088	And the system itself actually looks pretty sleeker.
5418128	5418508	I don't know.
5418749	5419489	It looks kind of neat.
5420110	5421531	And a lot bigger screen.
5423772	5424052	I don't know.
5424533	5425554	It's pretty cool.
5425574	5427095	I'm sure they're going to show a little bit.
5427255	5434663	Even though it's not really gaming, they may show a little bit more of it during a Microsoft Press conference tomorrow.
5435784	5437105	I don't know.
5437125	5437866	It looks kind of cool.
5439207	5441169	I kind of want to get one.
5441189	5442751	Really?
5442771	5443071	Really?
5443769	5444049	Maybe.
5444369	5444710	I don't know.
5444990	5447052	I have my new stereo in my car.
5447072	5452556	This is interesting though from you because you usually are not a big portable person.
5452656	5457720	I know you have a lot of iPhone hate, but it would be interesting to see you get the Zoom out of all this.
5458440	5460562	What is it about this that makes you excited?
5463529	5471311	Well, apparently they're going to integrate the Zune into Xbox Live, creating a game-changing entertainment experience, as they say.
5471331	5473312	But that could be just a whole bunch of PR fluff.
5473652	5473972	I don't know.
5474092	5476333	I have to see what functions they're actually going to do.
5476353	5482415	Remember they were talking back before that they're going to have X and A games available to play on the Zune, so that might be kind of cool.
5483475	5483855	I don't know.
5483895	5484335	We'll see.
5484475	5489357	I probably won't end up actually getting one, but it would be neat to see what they're going to offer for it.
5491532	5495995	All right, well, I guess we will see what happens as more is revealed on the Zune HD.
5496055	5506142	I'm sure this is going to be one of the big things at Microsoft's press conference, which is weird, though, because this is not necessarily games unless they're going to be talking about the gaming aspect of it, right?
5506462	5507663	Probably, yeah.
5508703	5509784	I hope it's something.
5511472	5519018	I'm sure they're going to try to do something like X and A for the Zoom.
5519138	5532129	It only makes sense because they'd be competing with Apple in that sense because they're going to have a marketplace that has applications and games similar to the Apple App Store.
5532629	5534231	Most importantly, however, will it blend?
5535316	5537157	That's the big question.
5553723	5553943	No way.
5554003	5554183	No way.
5578739	5581140	I don't really know why they would need to make competition for PlayStation Home.
5581160	5581860	I don't think
5602113	5602854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5623713	5630936	and how many people do you honestly know that are going to sit down at the Sony PlayStation and go, okay, I'm going to go into home to launch this game, right?
5631276	5635037	Nobody really does that except maybe the one time to check out how it works.
5635357	5642440	You know, there isn't a lot of draw in home to make that the place I start my gaming experience right now.
5642780	5649762	Maybe Microsoft, if they build this into a future NXE, is going to make something like home the place to start your gaming experience.
5650722	5652183	Well, they're going to have to do a lot.
5656775	5668763	XBLA announces Uno Clusterfuck I would check out Uno Clusterfuck I would play Uno Clusterfuck I could be with 300,000 people all at once Drop 4, bitches!
5671005	5680852	I could see that Uno Clusterfuck That'd be fun So we'll see what happens I doubt this will be an announcement at E3 this year anyway Maybe next year, who knows
5681838	5682419	Oh, maybe.
5683419	5684740	Well, how about some other stuff, though?
5684800	5685280	How about it?
5685981	5687282	How about betas?
5688543	5689363	Beta, beta, betas.
5689664	5690824	I thought you couldn't get those anymore.
5690844	5691845	It was all VHS now.
5694007	5694587	But I'm pumped.
5695231	5696752	This was me blinking at Rob.
5698692	5700693	There was the 1 vs. 100 beta.
5700873	5702813	It was going on in Canada.
5703474	5705114	Or as some people say, Canadia.
5705934	5706615	I say Canada.
5708215	5711476	It is supposed to be, though, coming to America as of June 1st.
5712296	5714417	So if anyone cares, there you go.
5714837	5717158	Microsoft's bringing it home, beta style.
5718530	5722932	And all of us that are traveling to E3 won't get a chance to play this, really, unless we bring our Xboxes with us.
5723352	5725893	I suppose I could try playing it.
5725933	5728615	Yeah, but weren't you asking me before the show, what the hell is this?
5729515	5733617	I've been hearing about it, and honestly, I was like... But have you ever seen the game show?
5734197	5735117	No, I don't watch TV.
5735157	5735938	Because it wasn't that great.
5736238	5737639	I mean, for one, it wasn't that great.
5737879	5741620	But if you heard a lot of good things about it, would you watch it, maybe?
5742161	5742621	Check it out?
5742961	5743161	No.
5743441	5744862	You didn't have that buzz with us.
5744902	5745782	He's not doing anything.
5745862	5746623	He just goes to E3.
5746643	5746703	But...
5747603	5748924	I would like to quote a line from Wayne's World.
5748944	5750365	Monkeys might fly out of my butt.
5750385	5751405	So you don't see yourself playing it.
5774395	5775656	No.
5775696	5779740	Red Entertainment says, am I only going to be able to play 1 vs. 100 only at a set time during the day?
5780141	5782643	Yeah, I think that's how I understand it set up, right?
5782663	5788048	Like they have show times, but I think it's not like they only let 101 people in.
5788149	5794675	No, it's people in the audience, there's also the actual mob, which is 100 people, and then there's the players.
5795828	5796408	Interesting.
5796488	5801572	So I would have thought maybe they have 30 different games, but they're all going at the same time.
5801892	5804874	That way everybody gets to be in the mob, but they're not going to do it that way, huh?
5805554	5806955	No, it doesn't quite work like that.
5807135	5810077	I think you have to register or something.
5810097	5810817	Well, that sucks.
5811578	5813559	What if I want to actually get to play the game?
5813759	5814440	Fat chance, right?
5814460	5815740	No, you will not.
5816381	5817101	This is where the $300,000 comes in.
5819218	5823780	SonOfDad says, only good thing about 1v100 is Bob Saget, who will not be a part of this.
5824441	5827602	And BlackWolf is correcting us, saying, no registration.
5827922	5831224	The reason there's a showtime is because there's a live host who conducts interviews.
5832349	5832790	That's kind of cool.
5832810	5833571	Screw the live host.
5833611	5834672	We don't need a live host.
5834772	5836615	Well, I mean, no, I like the idea of a live host.
5836655	5839178	I just kind of thought, I don't know, I thought... Just outsource it to India.
5839238	5842723	To a common... Oh, God.
5843044	5844225	So we can have it 24 hours.
5844265	5845247	Can you imagine?
5847189	5847510	Wow.
5847830	5849132	I don't know who you are anymore.
5849352	5851113	That still earns me the Who Cares award of the week.
5872971	5873371	I'd care.
5873431	5874711	I'm a big fan of game shows.
5875132	5876832	I want to check this out.
5877132	5878952	Primetime Survivor.
5879052	5880653	I would be all over that game.
5880773	5882893	Tooth and Nail playing Primetime Survivor.
5882913	5883933	I hope that's the next game.
5883993	5885334	Or was it The Amazing Race?
5885914	5886514	Any of those games.
5886754	5888934	I don't know how you play The Amazing Race on Xbox.
5889975	5891215	I don't think that would work.
5891815	5892715	Tap A to run.
5892855	5894155	Tap A to be amazing.
5895876	5896496	Alright, anyhow.
5898245	5903429	Well, you know, 1 vs. 100 still weighs off from actually coming out.
5903890	5907573	But Sims 3, that's on its way out later this week.
5908393	5909294	And already!
5909773	5910133	and DarkSakura.com.
5933403	5933964	And then props.
5933984	5935585	Is that a new verb you just invented?
5935665	5936246	Nippliest?
5937407	5939849	The most... Nipple-less.
5940069	5941511	The most nippliest women.
5942091	5943192	No, nipple-less.
5943533	5944574	Oh, nipple-less.
5944834	5945455	Oh, I'm sorry.
5945935	5949558	I thought you were using it to describe somebody.
5949859	5951040	She was quite nipply.
5952561	5955242	That actually is the word that people use, Rob.
5955362	5958802	Oh, I guess that's true, but not to just say it's cold.
5959062	5962083	I would not be able to take credit for that phrase.
5962323	5965904	I believe Chevy Chase said it a long time ago in Christmas Vacation.
5967724	5969064	It's a bit nipply outside.
5969624	5970224	Alright, whatever.
5970384	5970624	Fine.
5970664	5971785	That is true.
5972385	5979086	So, and then, besides that, The Sims 3 apparently, within the first four days of its online debut...
5980475	5983696	It had been downloaded 180,000 times.
5984477	5993582	And apparently they claim that you are playing a non-final, unauthorized copy of The Sims 3.
5993862	5994363	Which is crap.
5996101	6001665	Yes, that is absolute crap, because I can tell you right now, retailers have had this game for two weeks now.
6001825	6018976	So, it's absolute crap, and what they mean by non-final is that you haven't registered it, so you can't download the other town they have available, Riverview, and also you get 1,000 sim points that you can buy virtual objects with.
6020397	6025260	But, you know what, it's only a matter of time before that gets leaked too, so just give it time.
6026584	6027224	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6045925	6048485	Yes, Bor will not get any more of my money.
6049126	6056387	I don't know, I feel like there's so many other games for me to play right now, I don't know if I could get sucked into Sims 3, but I'll watch Jamie play it, and if it looks interesting, I'll buy it.
6056567	6063848	I only want to kill naked Sims in this game, so I can't see myself actually spending money and time to play this game.
6064168	6070209	So all I'm going to do is download the Uncensored patch, download the new skins that make naked Sims, because that's funny for some reason.
6070249	6072350	Naked Sim party, naked Sim death party.
6072370	6073250	I have naked Sims.
6073510	6079668	and, you know, the other costumes and skins that they have, like the Make a Joker Sim and, you know, just ridiculous stuff.
6079708	6080210	And then just...
6081055	6084638	Kill them all in really interesting ways.
6084998	6086819	And that's how I'll spend an evening.
6087239	6088440	And then we're done.
6088720	6090041	Then I don't play it ever again.
6090081	6091142	That's what happened to The Sims.
6091422	6095065	And then every now and then I'll go back to it, reinstall it, and do it all over again.
6095465	6096346	And then we're done.
6097426	6102330	So I really don't see a point in me buying this full retail game for this.
6102590	6103991	I don't care about the other town.
6104211	6106853	I don't need another town to visit to kill The Sims in this way.
6107373	6107814	It's just...
6108374	6110019	You don't want to kill the Sims in the other town?
6110160	6111002	I guess I could.
6111082	6111584	Why not?
6111604	6112306	I just don't really care.
6118442	6119522	and totally enjoyed it.
6119562	6123523	DarkSakura, have you ever gone on the naked death spree in The Sims?
6124463	6126944	No, not yet because I told you I'm too busy building houses.
6127124	6140027	I was trying to make a haunted house once and there was another time that the mailman came and then I trapped them with a moat and that was funny too because they couldn't figure out how to leave and then I killed the mail person by starving them to death.
6141487	6146031	I would love to see like a real absurd Sims type game.
6146231	6147493	Maybe this game exists somewhere.
6147513	6148213	Someone will have to tell me.
6148613	6155960	Like a very absurd Sims type game or an add-on that is all about the horrific death of your Sims.
6156604	6157044	Why not?
6158144	6159385	I don't know if you remember this.
6159465	6172228	They had a freeware game that someone made called Lamers and it was a spin-off of Lemmings where you had a gun and different weapons and you shot the Lemmings as they ran across the street.
6172288	6176110	All the stuff would be AI-driven so they would be doing the builders and that kind of stuff.
6176770	6178550	But no, you couldn't let them get to the home.
6178730	6179731	You had to kill them.
6180311	6181071	I would play that.
6181651	6182291	It was awesome.
6182531	6183772	I bet it's online somewhere.
6183792	6184672	Just look up Lamers.
6186070	6187191	The freeware Lemmings spit on.
6187211	6187892	I hate Lemmings.
6189152	6191855	Yeah, Lemmings was awesome like 10 years ago.
6191915	6193316	Lemmings reminds me of people I know.
6193356	6197879	But now, like, Lemmings, they re-released it for the PSP and the PlayStation 3.
6198540	6200701	Like, it's popular all over again or something.
6200741	6201102	I don't know.
6202142	6202723	I can't talk.
6202783	6206326	I had a fan site for drawings I would do.
6206466	6209308	Just because apparently the only thing I could draw at one time was Lemmings.
6209605	6209845	Sonic R
6224051	6225351	I love Sonic R!
6225532	6226172	Oh my god.
6226192	6227392	No, no, no, no, no, no.
6227432	6229113	You don't even understand, okay?
6229193	6230773	I'm sure it was one of your games of the week before.
6231194	6240917	Yeah, actually I think it has been, but I was so... The one thing I was super mad about Vista is that I couldn't play Sonic R unless I play in compatibility mode, then it fucks up my resolution.
6241499	6243220	What does this game sound like to you?
6243280	6243340	No!
6270976	6271756	Thanks for watching!
6297649	6299291	Sonic Plus Monkeys.
6299331	6301512	Did you just say Sonic Butt Monkeys?
6301873	6303474	No, Sonic Plus Monkeys.
6303754	6304575	That's what the game is.
6304775	6305536	And the DS in 2010.
6305596	6307758	I wonder if Ulala will be in it.
6309119	6310800	I swear you said Sonic Butt Monkeys.
6310900	6312842	Instant purchase if Ulala's in it.
6312862	6315484	Well, remember, she was in Sega Superstar Tennis, I believe.
6315745	6316665	So, um...
6319086	6322887	I fucking hate that Sega keeps teasing Ooh La La in front of us, though.
6322967	6325288	Like, remember Space Channel 5?
6325368	6327989	Too bad you're never gonna see another one.
6328289	6332050	I wonder if we're gonna have if Ooh La La's in it, if Space Michael will be in it.
6333030	6333270	Nope.
6333650	6334630	Don't hold your breath.
6335290	6336411	I like Space Michael.
6336451	6340492	It's the only cool incarnation he's had since, you know, Thriller, when he was a zombie.
6342072	6343012	Leo Shen agrees with me.
6343092	6345393	I will only buy this game if Ooh La La is a guest again.
6345433	6346233	She was in Riders.
6347162	6349345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6364143	6368484	Um, Sega is going to be doing downloadable vintage games on Xbox Live Arcade.
6369145	6376367	Um, starting off with one of the pinnacle of video games, Gunstar Heroes, on June 10th.
6377047	6379588	And, of course, the next day it'll be out on PlayStation Network.
6380388	6382729	Um, it is actually, um...
6385060	6396394	That's the only one that's supposed to be coming out on PlayStation Network so far but there were seven other titles announced for Xbox Live Arcade which I think that I've already covered this.
6398457	6403924	Arcade Shinobi, Comic Zone, Altered Beast, Sonic 3, Phantasy Star 2, Sonic & Knuckles, and Gunstar Heroes.
6406674	6409796	Great, except for the fact I already own that Sega collection.
6410096	6413538	Do you know how many copies of Gunstar Heroes we have in Gunstar Superheroes?
6414298	6418940	And, you know, all versions of... And let me guess, this will be one more because you need the achievements, right?
6420341	6421001	It's Dan.
6421061	6421882	He'll get it.
6422162	6422602	He'll get it.
6422862	6423522	I know he'll get it.
6423882	6424223	By the way...
6425515	6428657	Loki found that clip of Lamers on YouTube that we were talking about earlier.
6428798	6430639	I think I've played that game before.
6431460	6432560	I think I played it before.
6432741	6434122	It looked very familiar to me.
6434662	6435723	Can you link that in chat?
6435803	6440807	I know this does no good for our podcast listeners, but can you at least link it in chat so they can kind of see what you're looking at here?
6440867	6442408	I just saw the best mashup game, Rob.
6442528	6442788	What's that?
6442928	6444109	Mashup game of the week.
6445130	6446111	Worms and Lemmings.
6447472	6449653	Wait, is this a real game or something you want to exist?
6450314	6452776	I'm going to start my mashup game of the week.
6453636	6454197	That's a lot.
6454764	6455384	Mashup game.
6456045	6457726	It is worms and lemmings.
6457806	6461188	Imagine your lemmings are running around and you blow them up with the... That's what this is.
6461268	6461609	Look at this.
6461629	6462429	Well, no.
6462889	6466672	You actually wage war on each other and your lemmings are your innocent bystanders.
6469502	6470082	WarGames WarGames
6496062	6496662	It might have.
6496682	6499443	Because the thing was, let's play Global Thermonuclear War.
6499923	6503384	Yeah, maybe it was that, but it came out much later than the movie was out.
6503444	6505084	I remember it was on VGA and all that.
6505384	6508765	They have this game available for download in the DOS Museum.
6508985	6509245	Nice.
6509305	6510125	I linked it in chat.
6510405	6510845	Very nice.
6510885	6511445	Thank you.
6511925	6513866	So you can check that out, dosmuseum.com.
6513906	6515986	Just look for Lamers.
6516766	6518727	And yes, you just gun down people.
6518927	6519447	That's all you do.
6522097	6526460	Somewhere right now in the world, a phone call is being made from an angry parental association.
6528782	6530383	Some folks in chat remember the game, too.
6530464	6531584	Redertainment says they're in chat.
6531604	6533906	Chat.orangeonsradio.com I remember playing this game.
6534907	6537629	When I saw the YouTube, then I was like, oh yeah, I have played this before.
6538670	6539290	Anyhow, more news.
6539310	6539791	Sorry, Loki.
6540433	6547256	So there's a possibility, according to Volition, that they may port Saints Row or Red Faction to the Wii.
6548137	6549858	And that's pretty awesome.
6550238	6556441	I guess during the Red Faction Guerrilla launch event in New York, someone apparently asked them about that.
6557401	6563184	And they said, though THQ may do Wii versions of our games in the future...
6563884	6567526	Volition won't be doing them, at least not for the next year or so.
6567746	6572027	So they may have another party or another company port them over.
6572768	6573048	I don't know.
6573068	6575048	I think Saints Row on the Weave is pretty awesome.
6576409	6576989	Why is that?
6577069	6581951	Even though graphically it would probably have to be scaled down, but what is it just with the motion control and everything?
6581971	6584152	Yeah, it'd just be murdering things.
6584665	6587647	Yeah, but wasn't that what Manhunt 2 was supposed to be?
6587687	6588528	And look how that turned out.
6588648	6591970	Yeah, but there's other games that are like that that are fun, like Scarface.
6592590	6595332	Scarface was pretty fun, and it was kind of the same type of game.
6595792	6597533	But just Saints Row is really over the top.
6599494	6601356	But yeah, I would rather see a Saints Row 3.
6604355	6606316	Saints Row is kind of one of those overlooked type friends.
6606336	6607337	How did the second one sell?
6607797	6608337	Not very well.
6608617	6609898	Yeah, it's too bad.
6611159	6613720	I'm actually planning on picking up the other expansion pack.
6613760	6617242	I still haven't played the last expansion pack that they had come out.
6617903	6621905	I've been too busy with other things, but I do want to go back to it because it's pretty fun.
6622225	6624686	I also have Left 4 Dead I haven't played yet and Fallout 3.
6625607	6627768	All these games that are just sitting waiting.
6627968	6629729	Oh, and Killzone 2 and Resistance 2.
6630710	6631350	It's too much.
6633953	6636354	All right, well, moving on with some more gaming news.
6637235	6640617	Another series that seems to be making a comeback, Trauma Team.
6640717	6642117	This is coming out from Atlas.
6642137	6643298	It's putting this out on the Wii.
6643638	6646780	And yes, this does appear to be in the same vein as Trauma Center and all that.
6647540	6650842	This is now Trauma Team is the game that's going to be coming out on the Wii.
6651382	6654444	It's going to be gameplay six different medical fields.
6654464	6656305	So you're not just necessarily a doctor now.
6656565	6661808	You're going to be a general surgeon, diagnostician, orthopedic surgeon, endoscope technician.
6662288	6665489	Oh great, you can do colonoscopies in a video game now.
6665889	6666669	Now I've heard everything.
6667029	6668829	Medical Examiner and EMT.
6669490	6670290	Very interesting.
6670310	6673410	Dude that mops up hospital rooms.
6673630	6675351	I just, I am shocked.
6675711	6677291	Because you know what an endoscopy is?
6677331	6677771	Yes, I do know it.
6677791	6679772	That's where they put a tube in your body somewhere.
6680112	6686453	So like, either you're going to be doing examinations down the mouth and throat, which I guess is probably likely, or up a butt.
6688393	6690374	This could be very interesting gaming.
6692222	6696830	is Trauma Team about me when I play it and not the victims in the game?
6697451	6699234	It'd be even better if you could do it.
6699294	6703120	Will it be Katie Couric showing it live on TV?
6703240	6704843	Do they have two-player in the last game?
6705874	6706955	I think they did, yes.
6707476	6708777	They should have two-player in this.
6709437	6714822	Except you would never want to play with me because I'd be like, let's play tic-tac-toe on his colon.
6716083	6720067	But it looks like, look at this, you're pounding on a guy's chest in this screenshot here.
6720087	6722089	God damn it, Liv!
6723010	6724211	Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor.
6725759	6731242	That would be awesome if they had some sort of vocal recognition software or something in there.
6731442	6735305	It's like Karaoke Revolution, so you gotta yell a phrase or something.
6735325	6735965	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
6736005	6737066	Look at this picture here.
6737126	6738186	I gotta link this in chat.
6738206	6738526	Look at this.
6739067	6743950	Some person lifting up their shirt, exposing their bra while the doctor's operating on them.
6744250	6748192	This is like little kids playing doctor realized it's a video game.
6748452	6749533	It's not a mastectomy.
6751974	6752394	Wow.
6752494	6754895	Wow, we're looking at Grey's Anatomy the game now.
6755456	6756076	Apparently.
6756836	6757116	My gosh.
6757196	6759277	Except Grey's Anatomy the game sucks.
6759337	6763319	Tigerclaw in chat says the tagline for the game would be explore your anus.
6765900	6773724	Okay, that was probably one of the single most beautiful things I've ever heard from a listener ever.
6774765	6775385	Boldly go.
6776752	6776992	Do it!
6777032	6777472	Oh my god, do it.
6777512	6778753	You have to do it right.
6779013	6779653	Do we have the option?
6779793	6782314	Do we have an option of leaving a sponge behind?
6805714	6807115	Oh, crap.
6807815	6813397	Like, you have to count the sponges and stuff and make sure that they're all there and then you don't.
6813417	6820279	And then later on, you know, it flashes to a cut scene where the guy's, like, feeling, you know, like, chest pains and stuff like that.
6820399	6821499	I can see the scenario now.
6821719	6821959	All right.
6822400	6823120	Scenario one.
6823300	6823840	Okay, here it is.
6824380	6827681	You've got the diagnostician is playing with the endoscopy.
6828141	6828982	It's like your team here.
6829042	6832083	So, okay, this patient has come in and is complaining of pains.
6832103	6832323	Okay.
6833143	6854329	and he's feeling some little tapping pains in his rear end and him and his partner were playing with gerbils a little while ago you gotta diagnose and treat someone put gerbils up his butt let's operate do we get to hear the Lemmy Winks song at that time?
6854429	6860491	this could be the most beautiful video game of all time this has so much potential so much potential
6861024	6869452	And then when they die on the operating table, then we have the spin-off, you know, the Phoenix Wright or the Ace Attorney series, you know.
6870353	6872555	Medical malpractice, Ace Attorney.
6875407	6877549	TheLegendOfZaku, we are so mature tonight.
6877909	6884234	TheLegendOfZaku in chat says, I seriously want to leave a junior mint on the patient before I stitch him up.
6884635	6886676	What, so your farts start smelling minty?
6886696	6888077	No, didn't you see that?
6888478	6888978	No, what?
6888998	6889038	No.
6889058	6890679	It's from Seinfeld.
6890779	6898506	They had a junior mint, they're watching an operation and they drop a junior mint and it gets into his body.
6899026	6901008	It makes him really sick, I guess.
6902822	6905884	What would happen if you really left a Junior Mint in someone's body?
6905924	6906524	It would suck.
6906764	6907684	You would not be happy.
6908265	6908745	That's all.
6909085	6909946	You would not be happy.
6910946	6911346	Alright.
6912187	6917189	This is getting way too... Frisbee is mentioning the sequel, Morgue Center.
6919150	6920110	Death is upon us.
6920591	6920971	Dude!
6923892	6924893	God, I love our chatters.
6924913	6927134	That is seriously the most fantastic name ever.
6927394	6928695	I love our chatters so much.
6928835	6929115	All right.
6929475	6931176	Look, we love the listeners so much.
6931216	6932736	Let's do a segment dedicated to them.
6932796	6933377	No!
6933637	6933917	Yes.
6935538	6936298	Why they hate.
6936518	6941180	You've just lavished praise upon our listeners for their genius comments tonight, DarkSakura.
6941260	6944142	And now you know what segment I'm getting to and you're complaining.
6944222	6948464	I'm sorry to take you away from house building, but it is that time where we open up the mailbag.
6949444	6954986	and read your emails at mailbag at orangelaundry.com and see what you guys have to say.
6955286	6957746	By the way, Marissa Congusto, you could die.
6957786	6959187	You would get a terrible infection.
6959227	6960447	That's what would happen with the Junior Men.
6960927	6961427	Just so you know.
6962708	6965408	See, chat room can answer the questions that we can't sometimes.
6965708	6969169	All right, DarkSakura, open up the old email bag at mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
6969189	6970550	You're going to have to put your house building away.
6970930	6971590	I know.
6971650	6972450	I was saving.
6972710	6972970	All right.
6973571	6974571	And let us know.
6974611	6975431	Look at this, Rob.
6975591	6976111	Look at this.
6976491	6977552	Oh, she's up and ready to go.
6977572	6978552	I had it ready.
6978792	6980313	Alright, email number one.
6980493	6981434	Dear OLR.
6981614	6987078	Dear Rob, I think you should stop giving Jamie a hard time and go eat a Junior Minute.
6988499	6993243	Love, OLR member number one.
6995344	6996645	Okay, first one is Cheeseburger.
6998536	7003798	Hey guys, last week I was listening live on my PSP, so cool, and was not in the chat room.
7004418	7007839	The thing I wanted to chime in was the discussion of arcade cabinets.
7008179	7014020	I don't remember who said they would kill for an original Star Wars arcade machine, but I would so kill for an original Star Wars arcade machine.
7014401	7021483	I'm 15, so obviously didn't grow up in the 80s, but I have always thought, and everyone tells me, that I was born in the wrong decade.
7022403	7024003	I would give anything to have grown up in the 80s.
7024783	7026064	No, Reagan, that's all.
7027165	7030527	I roam eBay for countless hours for classic video games.
7031008	7036192	I watch all of the AVGN videos and, well, the Angry Video Game Nerd, to translate.
7036652	7040656	And while this email is getting too long, my longest OLR email so far, I'm going to shut up.
7041756	7042177	P.S.
7042417	7050944	Sky, I mess around with iPod custom firmware and would like to make an OLR custom firmware for iPod, so could you send me or link me to some OLR picks to work with?
7052793	7060196	I will totally forget that request, so send me a message to my personal email at rob at orangeandre.com and I will be happy to do that.
7061877	7066659	Also, I do want to commend our dear friend Cheeseburger for vastly improving in spelling and grammar.
7068460	7069760	The most improved award!
7070360	7072381	You win a shiny, shiny gold star.
7073702	7074262	Seriously!
7074602	7077783	This is probably one of the most legible emails I've received from Cheeseburger.
7077803	7079004	Here you go, have a Junior Mint.
7079910	7082392	You get a golden Junior Mint, which you don't want to know why it's gold.
7083372	7084273	Next email!
7086014	7087335	This is from Alpha Cananogram.
7087955	7090157	Dear OLR, this is a quick last minute email.
7090217	7092118	Well, it's a lot longer than I thought it would be, actually.
7092579	7098142	I plan on getting a PSP Go, but I'm keeping my PSP 2000, which has the earliest motherboard and firmware version 3.90.
7098202	7101565	The one I had to fix and asked y'all's advice.
7101905	7103386	God, I miss people saying that.
7103886	7109012	advice on removing that damned stripped screw, which I finally got out.
7109332	7112977	I pre-ordered a game that comes out in a month that is on UMD.
7113057	7118062	I'm importing slash paying for this one since it comes with a physical pre-order bonus that you can't pirate.
7118983	7127265	But I have just realized that I haven't bought any recent PSP games that require a firmware update since my PSP's D-pad was previously broken for the longest time until recently.
7127806	7132647	And this game probably will have a firmware update on it that will want to be installed before the game can be played.
7133027	7142330	The thing is, with multiple commas, is that I still want to hack this PSP and play the game without updating, but I have no Pandora battery or Magic Memory Stick.
7143070	7149194	Do y'all know anyone or any place that is reputable and cheap or free to get either of these items from?
7149614	7151055	I probably can make the memory stick thing.
7151075	7152296	I'm not sure about the battery part.
7154217	7157139	You can make the battery, but you need to have another PSP to do that.
7160461	7161822	So borrow a friend's?
7162083	7165765	Another PSP of the custom firmware, and then there's a program that you can run to make the battery.
7166420	7168901	And then to make a battery for a 2000, it's a pain in the ass.
7169841	7171702	Because you have to do some extra steps.
7172503	7173223	But it's not that hard.
7173283	7173663	I did it.
7173783	7174563	I still have one.
7176024	7176124	Oh.
7176484	7177205	I still have one.
7179766	7183487	Also, if we're ready then for the conclusion of the email, that's answered the question.
7183987	7187549	This email has been brought to you by Yoshi's Island, home of the never-ending crying baby Marios.
7187669	7187929	Whee!
7188703	7190684	God, I hated Toys R Us when that thing was there.
7191004	7191644	Oh, man.
7191744	7192884	Did you used to play that demo?
7192904	7193985	Did you used to work at Toys R Us?
7194085	7198006	No, I just used to frequent Toys R Us when they had toys in there.
7198346	7200547	Now that it's Baby RS slash Toys R Us.
7202308	7205989	I have to say, though, Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy, one of the greatest stages in all of video gaming.
7206462	7206862	P.S.
7207042	7211803	I didn't notice a USB port or spot to access battery on the PSP Go pictures, comma, comma, comma.
7211963	7212203	Hmm.
7212803	7216444	Well, then again, E3 hasn't happened yet, so I suppose it is a secret to everybody.
7216884	7217404	P.P.S.
7217824	7219405	I am probably going to grammar hell, ain't I?
7221325	7222605	P.P.P.S.
7222765	7224706	to DarkSakura, comma, comma, comma, heart.
7225466	7226466	I know you did that on purpose.
7226486	7227886	Okay.
7228486	7228846	Whatever.
7229787	7231467	Next email, dun-dun-dun.
7231847	7232027	Hmm.
7233666	7234986	I think this is from Actdeft.
7235166	7235507	Yeah, it is.
7235787	7238888	Hi, OLR crew, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.
7239468	7243489	I'm writing today to ask a couple of questions and to fill some space up in the old mailbag.
7243629	7244649	I hope you can answer them.
7245029	7250831	I'm probably getting a PSP soon, and yeah, I know the PSP Go is coming and all that stuff, but I personally think the design sucks.
7251111	7251771	Amen!
7251871	7252992	Oh my god, it looks like cell phone.
7254213	7270455	of course one of my immediate purchases is Rock Band Unplugged and I already have Prinny Can I Be the Hero and Pump It Up Portable my question is what other games should I look out for especially cheap ones since my budget isn't that big right now any type of game except SRPGs are good
7270950	7273192	Hotapon 2 and LocoRoco 2, both $20.
7273452	7274092	LocoRoco.
7274312	7279876	Luminous is one of the greatest puzzle games you'll ever play and the PSP is the platform to play it on, especially if you can find Luminous 2.
7280737	7286741	The sequel was really effing good and unfortunately didn't quite have that same magic and momentum of its first game.
7287121	7289283	Although the first game does have Shining and some really good tracks.
7289643	7291144	Luminous 2, don't overlook it.
7291384	7293045	It's a great little puzzler game.
7293065	7295247	If you can find it on the cheap, definitely pick that up.
7295267	7296688	And the Grand Theft Auto games are pretty good too.
7298506	7312585	also since you're going to be at E3 I would like to ask you to look for any info on a possible American release of Space Invaders Extreme 2 I love the first game and have the Xbox Live Arcade version I would love to have a localized version of it instead of importing it
7313666	7320972	I also want to follow up on a call of mine from a few weeks back in the Latin America release of Patapon 2, since it's download only in the States.
7321473	7329459	I searched in some stores here in Mexico a few days ago and found they were selling Patapon 2, and surprisingly it was on UMD, no download copies here apparently.
7330140	7341108	Thank God Sony did the right thing here and released it on physical media, it would have been a pain in the ass just to download the thing from the PSN store, though of course the game costs double the price in the U.S.,
7342009	7343149	Well, those are my questions for now.
7343229	7346470	I wish you a good trip to E3, Sky and Loki, and I hope you have a great time there.
7347171	7349111	P.S., bring us some E3 swag.
7350212	7352912	We just might.
7353353	7355613	Okay, I guess this is Dan Shadow.
7355893	7357114	What's your favorite kind of flour?
7357194	7357894	Mine's chocolate.
7358894	7359214	What?
7359955	7360415	Whatever.
7361595	7362415	I like tuna.
7363016	7363956	Mine's tuna.
7364676	7366417	Type of, wait, what, flour?
7367677	7368137	Flour?
7369438	7370478	The game on PlayStation 3.
7371289	7372330	I don't know.
7373030	7373491	Baking.
7374771	7376352	That's F-L-O-W-E-R.
7376653	7377553	You didn't say that.
7378634	7380055	I said flower, not flower.
7380275	7380835	You know what?
7381376	7382416	Go stuff a junior, man.
7383337	7384498	Where the sun don't shine.
7384558	7385398	How about the last email?
7385418	7386079	Of virgins.
7388420	7389141	Hello?
7391542	7392443	I see what you did there.
7392523	7392803	Okay.
7393503	7395285	You made a dumb email pretty good, Loki.
7395305	7395665	Good job.
7397588	7400089	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio crew.
7400109	7402410	This is Blue Swim from the LOL Army's Twitter division.
7402990	7407731	Over the Memorial Day weekend last week, my beloved cat of 13 years, Goldie, took ill.
7408251	7412573	After her condition worsened, I had to do the toughest thing I've ever done and had her put to sleep.
7413433	7415653	Her passing was the first time I've cried since I was a kid.
7415833	7416894	What a downer.
7417254	7418654	Why did you have to end with this one?
7418674	7419555	This is sad.
7419635	7420975	I'm so sorry to hear about that.
7421015	7422295	It's never easy to lose a pet.
7422355	7423336	It's like losing a baby.
7423536	7424556	My kitty died.
7424952	7425472	It's sad.
7425732	7426213	It's sad.
7426233	7427554	Now I'm going to be in a bad mood the rest of the night.
7427574	7428674	Oh, let me finish reading the email.
7428714	7428974	Fine.
7429315	7429995	Stop being a baby.
7430895	7435418	It wasn't uncommon for her to walk over and plop herself down on my lap while I was in the middle of playing a game.
7435878	7438280	She'd do it even while I was playing the drums and rock band.
7438540	7441741	It's actually one of my favorite gaming memories, which leads to my question for this email.
7441762	7442822	This is so sad.
7443082	7446724	Do you guys have any gaming-related memories involving a pet or pets that you've had?
7447965	7450046	Thank you for doing OLR all this time.
7450146	7451327	Keep doing what you're doing, Blue Swim.
7452395	7456657	My old cat, Madeline, really the only cat I had because I haven't had one in many years.
7456717	7457958	She passed away several years ago.
7458458	7460339	She was actually named after the actress Madeline Kahn.
7460799	7461739	That's fantastic.
7461779	7464180	Yeah, because Clue was my favorite movie growing up.
7464220	7470003	So when we got my cat, I named my cat after Madeline Kahn because, of course, Mrs. White was one of the best characters in that movie.
7470543	7477566	Anyhow, my cat would actually – while I was playing video games, my cat liked to hang out – Shermie's not on her box, I can tell you that –
7479327	7482729	My cat liked to hang out in this patio room that we had.
7482769	7486291	We had an indoor patio, and that was basically the cat's room.
7486631	7490333	My mom didn't like the cat in the house because it would get fur everywhere, but the cat basically had her own room.
7490654	7493335	But we had a glass door leading to this indoor patio.
7493655	7498378	So when I would play video games, I remember my cat would run up and just kind of stare through the door at the TV.
7498778	7502280	But we all know cats don't really see the same images we do.
7502320	7503301	It was something about the TV.
7503341	7503621	I don't know.
7503641	7507103	But when I was a young kid, I used to think, oh, she loves watching me play video games.
7508144	7509545	I remember that with my cat.
7511226	7512587	Do you have a pet-related story, Loki?
7513908	7519092	Yeah, my cat chases the Wii pointer on the screen.
7520152	7528919	Like, when Animal Crossing would come, when we'd play Animal Crossing, and the little bus logo thing would pop up on the screen, she'd get down the bottom of the TV and start pawing at it.
7530265	7539290	When I got DDR Second Mix, this was actually not too long after I first got Shermie, so she was probably about two years old at the time.
7540250	7549155	She used to hit the analog button on the Dreamcast pads and start the game for me or put me in another, you know, put me in SSR.
7549915	7550876	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7568025	7572551	Marissa in chat says, that has inspired me to name a cat if I ever get one, Gilda.
7572851	7574072	What an amazing name for a cat.
7574353	7576075	What an amazing woman Gilda Ranma was, by the way.
7576095	7577216	My sons have a cat named Sylvia.
7577496	7577697	Sorry.
7578017	7580620	I'm going to get all weepy if we keep talking about these cats.
7580640	7583624	Let me see if I've got another email.
7583644	7584725	Don't we have a dick and fart joke?
7584745	7585946	Can't we tell more Junior Men jokes?
7586107	7586387	Something?
7587047	7588809	Oh, shoot, I forgot to read the very last part of that email.
7588949	7589210	Oh, okay.
7589610	7596477	In case you were curious, the title of this email, and lost a friend, is a reference to the Exploder Evacuated Part 2 radio commercial from GTA Vice City.
7596857	7598318	Now you know annoying is half the battle.
7598519	7598819	Peace.
7599419	7599800	Smiley.
7600663	7603844	Well, best of luck with, and I'm really sorry to hear about your loss.
7604064	7608386	And if your family decides to get another cat, there are many, many cats out there who need love.
7608706	7609367	Adopt a cat.
7609567	7612288	Everyone, go out there and adopt a cat.
7612328	7614129	Well, some people are allergic.
7614169	7615729	So, I'm allergic.
7616150	7619311	I have air filters in my house and I take sinus medicine every day.
7619871	7620832	I love my cat.
7621532	7623193	I will do whatever I can to keep my cat.
7624133	7626655	So, if I can't... The only thing, I won't get a dog.
7627216	7630959	Because I'm actually so allergic to dogs that allergy medicine does not touch it.
7631079	7635042	I actually... I don't know if I've ever gotten into this on the show, and maybe I shouldn't, but I actually have a fear of dogs.
7635562	7636343	It's taken me a little... Do you?
7636763	7639526	Yes, I have a definite case of fear of dogs.
7639786	7640706	It doesn't matter the size.
7640867	7642208	I get really nervous around dogs.
7642588	7649393	I've gotten a lot better with it in the past five years than I would say from the time I was five through about the time I was like 21.
7649694	7650494	It was really bad.
7650855	7653036	Like, whenever I get around dogs, I get really nervous.
7653116	7653277	Like, I...
7654057	7655598	Can't, like, be around dogs.
7655858	7660762	And this goes back to, I was bit by one when I was five, and it was very traumatic.
7661362	7662803	Be careful with that, it's older than me.
7663143	7665165	Oh, yeah.
7666645	7667246	You know what, though?
7667306	7668126	You should meet Pocket.
7668407	7670588	I think, actually, you'd scream like a little girl about Pocket.
7670888	7676612	See, here's the thing, and I don't want to disappoint you, but everybody tells me I would feel different about their dog, and I won't.
7677232	7679074	I think you'd scream like a little girl around Pocket.
7679454	7680835	Pocket is this big.
7681175	7682917	Oh, then I would scream in terror.
7684459	7686481	You want to put me in my own personal hell?
7686601	7687182	Sure, I'll do that.
7687222	7691306	She's part chihuahua and part toy something and has the loudest bark ever.
7691506	7693368	That's not even... I won't have a dog.
7693509	7695751	I won't have a dog and I don't let them in my house.
7697032	7698013	So you don't have to worry about it for me.
7698033	7701117	The only kind of dog I want is a corgi.
7702238	7713176	INGN0 and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not pronouncing your name right probably says Rob you fear guns projectiles and dogs yeah that about covers it you know I wonder if you would be okay with a Basenji
7714434	7716335	They're not really like a modern dog.
7716555	7717155	I will say this.
7717195	7719856	There has been one dog that I was able to get along with.
7719976	7723677	And it was my grandma's old Dachshund wiener dog.
7724717	7727478	Because, yeah, it was missing an eye.
7727818	7736041	So it was a handicapped dog and very, very quiet, very slow moving, very, you know, like very just peaceful dog.
7736061	7737381	So you need an old lazy dog.
7737521	7739022	I need an old lazy dog, if anything.
7739042	7739922	Well, I don't need a dog.
7740322	7741362	I will always be a cat person.
7741382	7742263	If you were to have a dog.
7742303	7742963	Which won't happen.
7743303	7749686	If someone told us to bring a dog in your house, it would have to be an old, lazy, fat dog.
7749966	7751146	Blind in one eye.
7751326	7752126	Answers to Lucky.
7752487	7758369	No offense to you dog owners out there, but just understand, this goes back to a childhood fear that I can't shake.
7758549	7759549	You have a fish called Kitty.
7760470	7761090	A fish called Puppy.
7761110	7761590	That's my roommate's.
7761610	7762110	You should get a cat.
7764322	7765242	Uh, Roommate doesn't want one.
7765903	7766783	And I understand.
7766843	7767963	So maybe later on.
7768163	7768743	Maybe later on.
7768823	7769524	But not right now.
7769844	7771544	I definitely am getting a cat at some point.
7772004	7776086	But, you know, when there's somebody else to take care of him.
7776106	7777366	If you get a boy cat named Frank.
7777966	7780587	I haven't even thought of names yet.
7780607	7782328	If I get a boy cat, his name is going to be Frank.
7782868	7785088	After Frank Converter.
7785128	7789350	Cheeseburger in our chatroom says, Rob Hell is a great Dane with mayo and guns.
7789450	7789890	Pretty much.
7791667	7792869	Pretty much that about sums it up.
7793209	7795212	All right, look, some more news because we want to take your calls.
7795232	7796614	We don't want to be here all night long.
7796654	7797255	Jeez Louise.
7797576	7798918	Yeah, you people got to get out of my house.
7799138	7800320	All right, Loki, please.
7801889	7805851	Well, I don't know if anyone remembers the old toy Madballs.
7806211	7806471	Yes.
7806791	7815115	But apparently Madballs are coming back with an Xbox Live arcade game called Madballs in Babbo Invasion.
7816215	7823058	And it's going to be an action game where you can basically like a shoot-em-up action game.
7823698	7830121	And it's going to have four-player co-op, 16-player multiplayer, and randomly generated maps.
7830781	7834243	and I have their PR guy keeps hounding me.
7834564	7837185	So we have actually a meeting with them at E3.
7837225	7838066	It's my first meeting.
7838626	7840968	So we'll find out more about it.
7841028	7845710	But, you know, when I first saw this, I'm like, Madballs, really?
7846291	7848792	Is that like a smart IP to try to bring back?
7848912	7850653	I mean, really?
7850794	7857318	But reading the comments on like some of these news stories, everybody's like really enthusiastic about it.
7857338	7859079	I'm like, okay.
7859099	7859179	Yeah.
7860069	7861310	You know who won't be playing that?
7861890	7862130	Me.
7864092	7867154	I will wait for Loki's report before I make a decision either way.
7868675	7869675	Oh, I was going to drag you along.
7870316	7870796	Oh, goody.
7871096	7871597	When is this?
7871677	7872097	Wednesday?
7872437	7873618	Noon, yeah.
7873678	7874298	Fine, I'll go.
7874419	7874999	We'll see.
7875299	7875960	It'll be short.
7876380	7879402	At least I'll feel like someone cares because I don't have a lot of meetings planned.
7880883	7884865	I find, especially with the smaller companies, if you walk up and care, they will talk your ear off.
7885046	7886406	So I'm all for it.
7886446	7886767	Why not?
7887523	7890646	Well, I don't want to spend an hour looking at this one game.
7890906	7891187	Well, yeah.
7891207	7892027	I mean, well, it depends.
7892828	7893249	It depends.
7893569	7894710	I'm going to open mind.
7895030	7895411	Open mind.
7895871	7897813	Give me a 15-minute spiel and that's it.
7898253	7900996	Well, they don't have a booth, so they don't really have anything to demonstrate.
7901056	7901256	I mean...
7903125	7903405	We'll see.
7903565	7903825	We'll see.
7904366	7904626	All right.
7905246	7907206	More to come, of course, next week.
7907246	7908947	Wait, we're not doing a show next week, are we?
7909227	7910608	Because of E3?
7911148	7911808	I'll be back.
7911928	7912628	Are you going to be back?
7913008	7914749	I'll be back, but I don't know.
7914849	7915169	We'll see.
7915249	7916610	We may or may not be here next week.
7916650	7918030	I know it's Bobby's 200th show.
7918090	7920131	He may want to go long or he might be tired too.
7921531	7923972	More to come on that if we will be here next week or not.
7923992	7925472	But we'll definitely do something to cover E3.
7925512	7925632	Anyhow.
7927293	7931560	I want to move on, though, with some of the news that came out this week, and the next story has to do with Grand Theft Auto.
7931580	7937810	This is some news that kind of got trumped a little bit by everything else, all the leaks coming out of E3, but this is certainly huge news.
7942168	7943109	The Ballad of Gay Tony
7959102	7968173	and apparently in this you will be taking on Luis Lopez, who is a part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to nightclub impresario Tony Prince, who is gay Tony.
7968473	7970095	Now, I don't know enough about the story.
7970155	7971276	Loki, please explain.
7971857	7974340	Who is gay Tony and is he just happy or is he gay?
7974520	7975881	Thank you for watching!
7990778	7999163	Both Nico and Johnny are there doing an exchange with the triads.
8000244	8001325	They're selling them diamonds.
8002125	8006809	And Louise comes in and basically robs them of their diamonds.
8007549	8032795	breaks up the whole thing and there's a big gun battle in the Museum of Natural History so that all goes down I'm not really sure what they're going to cover with this there's a lot of speculation saying because the last expansion they updated like the rock and rap stations and stuff this is going to be more of the electronica updates as far as music goes and stuff and it's supposed to focus around Algonquin his nightclub and stuff like that maybe like the safe house and stuff
8033146	8043154	Now, before you might think my feathers are ruffled being the gay guy on the show that they're naming this the Ballad of Gay Tony or whatever, I actually kind of don't care because Rockstar has a track record of handling these issues pretty good.
8043194	8047378	I mean, we remember Bully, you know, actually kind of handled it fairly interesting.
8047858	8051521	And, you know, I don't see any, you know, if it's a gay character in a story, who cares?
8051541	8056406	I think you run into Gay Tony in the first game, well, like the main storyline.
8056886	8059588	You know what it's all about and how they handle it.
8060229	8060429	Yeah.
8061516	8064518	Now, but let me tell you what pisses... Well, is there anything else you want to mention about this?
8064779	8066920	Because I'm going to segue into the FUs of the week here.
8066960	8070083	Because there is one thing about this that kind of pisses me off.
8070763	8077008	And it's the whole fact that you can call this game the Ballad of Gay Tony, but heaven forbid you can't put gay in your profile.
8077949	8080191	Remember that whole thing that came up a couple weeks ago?
8080531	8084314	Where Microsoft says you can't talk about the sexuality stuff in your profile?
8084594	8087396	But yet it's okay to name the game the Ballad of Gay Tony.
8088217	8090378	So, I see a double standard here.
8090878	8092860	And when I see double standards, I get very irritated.
8093300	8096822	Not that I want to put gay in my profile, but if somebody does, why shouldn't they be allowed to?
8097542	8101984	You know, if somebody wants to put, hi, I'm gay or whatever, then that's their prerogative.
8102085	8104606	If somebody puts, I hate gays, well, that's a lot different.
8105186	8105746	See what I'm saying?
8106427	8108248	But anyhow, there's a clear double standard here.
8108288	8109348	Double standards piss me off.
8109388	8110309	It's time for the FUs of the week.
8125530	8129451	Sorry to hear it.
8129471	8131372	Sorry I'm not laughing.
8131392	8136154	It's just funny out of everything that comes out of it.
8136194	8139535	You got that?
8139555	8140895	Sorry to hear it.
8155779	8184325	FU to housework and because my knees hurt because I've been crawling around on laminate flooring and they're all bruised so that sucks and I still have lots of painting to do and I have a lot of other stuff I have to do and we're moving in in two weeks so yikes so FU to work oh and I've been getting up at 8 in the morning working until like 6 at night I took off a day of work after morning lay of work at the house so
8184847	8185968	Yeah, long days.
8186148	8187829	But how is it being in your own house now?
8188449	8190730	It'll be cool when it's done.
8190750	8193332	We have the baseboards to do and the painting and stuff.
8193612	8196654	Luckily, my parents are helping out with the kitchen and stuff.
8196674	8197494	My dad's been really cool.
8197514	8200616	He's been coming down to actually help me during the days.
8200656	8204938	He's offered to come in during the time I'll be gone and read stuff.
8204998	8206880	He'll come in and do all the baseboards.
8206900	8209861	And my mom's going to be painting while I'm gone and stuff.
8210302	8213163	Couldn't have done it without him, so it's really cool.
8213523	8214544	But yeah, it's pretty awesome.
8215920	8222425	I'm tempted because my wife promised when we get a house, I can get an arcade cabinet.
8222485	8224627	Of course, she said that a long time ago.
8225388	8226969	So, maybe.
8229631	8230932	But I'm not building it this time.
8231052	8232653	It'll be pre-cut, pre-fab.
8236654	8253685	and I will go ahead and say my FU of the week goes to spammers oh my god I've been getting more spam on Gmail lately like I don't know what happened but over the weekend the spammers figured out how to get through or something and I've been getting spam messages like crazy on Gmail I don't know if it's just me I've been too, I've been too
8253985	8255767	I'm getting so pissed off.
8256607	8258069	I fucking hate spammers.
8258409	8259930	I fucking hate them.
8260451	8261952	Why do they do this?
8261992	8263874	They slow down the internet with all their traffic.
8264114	8267517	Do people actually buy the shit in these emails?
8268098	8270800	Do people actually legitimately believe this stuff?
8271320	8275824	And sadly, even if one person out of a million believes it, it's probably worth it to these people.
8276145	8280228	But they're just the parasites of pawn scum.
8280448	8280949	I hate it.
8281149	8281529	I hate it.
8302572	8304513	That's a pretty epic F.E., Rob.
8304553	8310297	Seriously, in countries that support spammers, we need to just drop a nuclear bomb or something.
8310397	8311358	Get rid of these people.
8312179	8313419	Alright, I'm being a little extreme.
8313760	8317082	But it is just obscene.
8317422	8319203	Like, we need to do something to stop this.
8320544	8323526	And it's not just that I'm annoyed.
8324247	8324927	I am annoyed.
8325287	8328990	It's not just that, but the fact that they slow down the internet with their poop.
8329980	8331541	that flies out of their keyboards.
8332281	8339423	I get more spam in my actual Orange Lounge account than I do... Seriously, we get inundated with the Orange Lounge and Gmail.
8339583	8340024	God!
8340044	8342545	I'm so sick of spam.
8345646	8352108	Unfortunately, it's part of the hazards of being on the internet.
8352408	8357530	However, I do not advocate just sitting back and letting it happen, of course.
8358308	8368378	All right, Bobby linked me to a website here with actually kind of a clarification, I suppose, on the whole, you called the game Gay Tony, but you can't have gay in your profile or whatever.
8368618	8378487	And this is a website called step2.com, which is, I think he's a guy who's involved with the, what is he, the community...
8380117	8383998	I don't think he's community director or something, but he does stuff with Microsoft.
8384839	8391941	Anyway, he basically says that the code of conduct policy does allow you to express vocally on the surface your relationship preference.
8392261	8397283	People get this wrong in saying all instances the word gay, for instance, are forbidden from all of Xbox Live.
8397643	8400164	Therefore, this new download content represents a violation.
8400204	8401004	This is not the case.
8401404	8403905	I appreciate the appearance of a disconnect, but there isn't.
8404485	8409048	There's other content in Grand Theft Auto 4 that would likewise not be allowed in a gamertag or profile.
8409368	8413850	Quotes from movies that you can obtain on Marketplace that are not allowed in gamertags or profiles.
8414331	8419634	Rated purchable content with all sorts of technical rules and restrictions as to what type of accounts can view them.
8420434	8425417	Limitations, synopsis, and plot summary and so forth that gamertags and profiles do not currently have.
8426951	8427331	I don't know.
8428332	8428632	I don't know.
8428672	8430212	I'm still not 100% convinced.
8430272	8433353	I'm thankful that they're aware that there's a disconnect here, but I don't know.
8433393	8436774	I'm not 100% convinced when we do see some of these reports coming out and so forth.
8437375	8439575	But I do appreciate the clarification, if nothing else.
8440476	8443897	And they say they're working with these organizations, etc., etc.
8444277	8447178	They've been working with them for months and months.
8447538	8449959	Let's see what happens.
8452108	8453789	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
8453889	8455070	We're almost to the phone.
8455150	8456290	DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind.
8457491	8462573	Well, this is... I don't know.
8463754	8474479	Tecmo Bowl for Wii is actually put on hold and is being converted into Family Fun Football.
8475479	8475559	Um...
8477320	8487344	They are basically saying that they're switching it to a family-oriented game because of market research and to go to the Wii's target audience.
8487864	8493026	Because that's everybody that owns the Wii is the family demographic and they are not going to recognize the name Tecmo Bowl.
8493186	8494546	So they're selling out.
8494807	8495787	Sad, but it makes sense.
8495967	8497728	Makes complete sense, sadly.
8497888	8503270	But on Xbox 360 there will be Tecmo Bowl for Xbox Live Arcade and that will be in early 2010.
8506721	8507522	Hunt for that at E3.
8508162	8508563	Let us know.
8509884	8511125	Cool.
8511285	8515750	There's some pretty cool stuff coming over from XSEED.
8515770	8521075	They're a company that localizes a lot of games that normally come out in Japan.
8521515	8523437	Are modern working designs?
8524257	8525098	Yes, basically.
8526317	8537744	In fact, some of the cool stuff that they're bringing to E3 this year, Ju-on the Grudge for the Wii, Fragile Farewell Ruins of the Moon, Lunar Silver Star Harmony for the PSP,
8543348	8545029	HalfMinuteHero for the PSP.
8545149	8548030	Remember that Yussa 30 game that they had?
8548650	8549510	That looks pretty sweet.
8550790	8561394	Arkrise Fantasia, Flower, Sun, and Rain, Little King Story, Ragnarok Online DS, and Valhalla Knights Elder Saga.
8562314	8565855	So lots of cool import-friendly stuff coming from them.
8567056	8568176	Probably a booth I'll have to visit.
8568982	8578525	Alright, well something else that is going to definitely appeal to some folks out there, and maybe not to others, but you might remember there was some talk about a Tony Hawk skateboard peripheral coming out very soon.
8578805	8581847	Well, some more details have leaked on Tony Hawk Ride.
8582367	8584287	That is the game, and this is from GameStop.
8584327	8586088	The game is coming out October 13th.
8586408	8587128	It's going to set you back $120.
8587248	8593411	That's right, Tony Hawk Ride, which comes with a little skateboard controller, so...
8594571	8595614	Could be interesting.
8596396	8597599	Could be dangerous, too.
8597720	8602813	I mean, God, I could just see people breaking their TVs left and right with this thing if you're having a little too much fun.
8604591	8605652	I don't know.
8605692	8607133	How much fun can this really be?
8608654	8609695	Am I just being a pessimist?
8609735	8610976	How much fun can this really be?
8611317	8614439	I mean, isn't part of riding a skateboard having wheels?
8614739	8616361	I mean, I guess you could make the same argument.
8616401	8619143	Well, how much fun is Wii Sports because it's not actual tennis?
8619463	8621785	Or why do people play Wii Bowling and not actual bowling?
8622205	8622606	I don't know.
8622646	8628210	There's something about this specifically that I'm looking at going, how can this really be fun?
8628551	8630912	This is a little curvy board that sits on your floor.
8631093	8631413	I don't know.
8631758	8633499	It'd be like, what was the arcade game?
8633539	8638302	But then again, I was defending Wii Fit earlier, so what the hell right do I have to bash this game?
8638423	8638763	I don't know.
8638943	8639583	Yeah, Rob.
8640304	8640724	No, really.
8641144	8649150	It'd be like, though, what was that one Sega game that you, you know, got to do all the... The Activator?
8649830	8651351	No, I'm talking about the arcade.
8652432	8654513	It would be something along those lines, I think.
8655894	8658316	You know... Oh, oh God, Alpine Racer.
8658756	8661338	Well, no, they had the skateboard game.
8662558	8663638	It was similar to that, though.
8663658	8664579	I know what you're talking about.
8664599	8665379	Trish State or something?
8665519	8666980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8667200	8670641	I guess, but even that, I don't know, had movement or something.
8671061	8674522	I mean, it wasn't just a board that was lying on the ground.
8674542	8674982	You know what I mean?
8675082	8677083	It actually spun around.
8677383	8677743	I remember that.
8677763	8679564	You used to have the golf lamp back in the day, right?
8679884	8682825	It would actually kind of spin around, and you had the railings to hold on to.
8683325	8685386	This is not going to be that elaborate.
8685566	8690427	You still had that feeling of motion in the game because of the whole elaborate setup it had.
8690487	8691028	That's true.
8691348	8691868	That is true.
8693818	8698043	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelandredu.com says, seriously, $120?
8698083	8700225	I can put that towards a real skateboard.
8700806	8702107	Hitstun corrects the name.
8702187	8703348	Topskater and Airtrix.
8703368	8704349	Topskater, that was it.
8704770	8706191	Airtrix is what I was actually thinking of.
8707072	8710015	And Rob D says, there were two arcade skateboarding games, but I don't remember the names.
8710035	8710616	Well, there they were.
8712198	8712658	So there it is.
8714740	8715301	Topskater.
8716690	8718853	Yeah, I think that's one of the ones I'm thinking of.
8718973	8722218	And I think we had both those games at one point at Golf Land.
8722499	8723420	But this isn't it.
8724061	8724702	I'll tell you that much.
8725563	8730310	One more story from all of us, then we're going to get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.
8730971	8732854	But first, a few more stories, DarkSakura.
8733809	8737010	Well, how about something for LEGO Indiana Jones?
8737050	8737850	This is kind of cool.
8738150	8742832	Well, for LEGO Indiana Jones 2, I should say, is that you're going to be able to build your own stages.
8745173	8754176	So basically you can do levels, tombs, challenges, sandbox areas, put down plates, traps, all that kind of fun stuff.
8754296	8759698	You can actually save everything and go back and do your playthrough again on your homemade level.
8760498	8762939	It's like Forge, but for LEGO Indiana Jones.
8763259	8763319	Yep.
8764178	8764878	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8789224	8789684	E3, Gladiator AD
8809469	8814714	An ultra bloody fighting game that puts you in the role of a roaming gladiator.
8815294	8816255	Looks pretty sweet.
8816876	8821800	And then to go along with that, something more like a normal traditional shooter.
8822400	8827665	A game called The Grinder, which is going to be kind of like a supernatural shooter game.
8827965	8831288	It's got like vampires and stuff like that and werewolves.
8832029	8832269	So...
8833590	8835212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8851050	8855254	Sometimes a game being at E3, though, is just a trailer showing on a monitor.
8855274	8855774	You know what I mean?
8856135	8857616	A lot of these games are probably like that.
8857856	8858437	It's possible.
8858497	8859297	Maybe we will see this.
8859938	8860438	I don't know, though.
8860879	8862060	Not every game is playable.
8862100	8863081	I think we forget that a lot.
8863121	8865283	A lot of shit at E3 is not touchable.
8866874	8868335	Like everything from Square Enix.
8869555	8869955	Usually.
8870716	8872417	I bet that new Kingdom Hearts game will be playable though.
8872457	8874257	Oh yeah, it's already out in Japan.
8874398	8876739	That's what, 328.3 or whatever it's called?
8876779	8877499	Some weird name.
8878279	8883842	Again, I don't understand because I thought this was a series aimed at kind of kids and they do all this weird stuff with it, but I don't know.
8883942	8885883	I don't understand some of the Kingdom Hearts logic sometimes.
8885903	8886723	I love the games though.
8886863	8887164	I do.
8887364	8887884	I really do.
8888664	8891646	And I know I'm not going to see Kingdom Hearts 3 at this year's E3 and I'm just going to be pissed.
8892146	8892246	Oh.
8893271	8894472	Are we going to go to the theater?
8895013	8895373	Thank you.
8895433	8898156	GameGuru says 3.58, two days is the name of it.
8898636	8902480	Yeah, I'd love to go to the theater and check it out if they have it again this year, which I assume they will.
8902500	8904001	Because it's always a waste of time.
8904441	8906223	No, I mean, not that I don't like doing it.
8906603	8906884	You know what?
8906964	8909947	I actually like seeing the epic Squeenix trailers on the big screen.
8910527	8915171	It's like, oh my god, it's a trailer for Final Fantasy XI!
8915651	8917033	Look, I make this comparison.
8917173	8920215	What about when you see trailers for movies on the big screen?
8920716	8927081	Like when you saw the trailer for The Dark Knight for the first time, or when you see the trailers for Harry Potter, if you're into that or whatever.
8927341	8932326	When you see these trailers on the big screen, isn't it so much better than when you're watching them on your tiny-ass computer screen?
8932446	8932986	Same thing.
8933507	8933907	Same thing.
8934651	8935192	It depends.
8935272	8935993	It really depends.
8936233	8936553	How so?
8937174	8944402	Well, I mean, because really, sometimes there's been, I'll just see movies that I really could care less about, honestly.
8945383	8947885	So, I was like, why did I have to see this big?
8947925	8950148	Why does it have to be involved in my life right now?
8950668	8951990	So, that's what I mean.
8953542	8971514	Alright, well let's move on to one more gaming story and then we're going to take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Please make sure if you're going to use Skype make sure you've tested your call with Echo123 as the username on Skype We had some issues last week with some of our callers so please make sure that your volume is okay by giving Echo123 a call
8973035	8977677	We got one more story for you guys, though, before we get to the phones, and it has to do with the DSi.
8978177	8981959	And I guess this is one of those, you knew this rumor would show up at some point.
8982019	8983080	I'm sure it's come up before.
8983120	8983580	Well, guess what?
8983620	8984560	It's coming up again.
8985341	8990163	Apparently, as you know, the DSi had the Game Boy Advance port removed from the game.
8990703	8994645	Well, could this possibly be because something a little shadier is in store?
8995325	8999988	You're going to soon be able to download Game Boy Advance titles onto your DSi.
9000328	9003770	Just like you download old school Nintendo games to your Wii pretty soon.
9004071	9009594	Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games on your DSi through the DSiWare store.
9010134	9011755	And move goes the cow.
9012436	9016418	I know, and the sheep will herd into this and buy this crap, I'm sure.
9018039	9018600	Tons and tons.
9019000	9019981	You know, I don't know though.
9020141	9023363	And at the same time, why can't they just put this stuff online?
9024468	9027969	I think some people forgot as well, we had a Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.
9045174	9046355	Yes, I remember that.
9046435	9048276	So they can put those games on your TV.
9048316	9051258	They'll find a Game Boy Color player on the Super NES.
9051278	9051758	That's right.
9052078	9053399	So they can put it on your TV.
9053439	9055861	So don't listen to that garbage that they can't do it.
9055961	9056521	Because they can.
9056862	9057302	They have.
9057822	9060224	Yeah, I was about to just say they can and have.
9061064	9065267	But, I mean, honestly, though, you know what the deal is for them.
9065427	9068409	In the end, the only thing that it is is the bottom line.
9069685	9070546	They can make money.
9070686	9071567	It's instant money.
9071627	9072448	It's free money.
9072888	9075431	They're going to find free money wherever they can.
9075511	9076513	That's the plan.
9077093	9078315	Anyhow, let's go to the phones.
9078335	9079516	They're ringing off the hook tonight.
9079817	9080858	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9080878	9081238	Who's this?
9082159	9083080	It's GS68.
9083421	9083781	Hello, GS68.
9083801	9084302	How you doing?
9086846	9088587	All right, I'm here to talk about Fandomate.
9088767	9093809	That's right, I don't think you were there last week while our show was going on, so how was Fandomate?
9093989	9109115	Yeah, unlike last year, I didn't get to call in at all or listen at all, so... That's all right, we had a short show last week because of the holidays, so we didn't end up doing a whole lot, and Loki wasn't here, so... And I know it hasn't gone on the podcast feed yet, but it will soon.
9109755	9110416	So what's on your mind?
9110576	9111216	How was the con?
9111236	9111756	Tell us about it.
9112136	9112757	It was pretty good.
9113837	9119000	I was mostly in the gaming room this year and I saw the most badass 2DX setup.
9119701	9125805	Like someone had actual arcade hardware hooked up to a PS2 with one of the PS2 versions of 2DX.
9125885	9129287	So my one complaint was that it was on an HDTV so it was very laggy.
9131808	9132349	That's pretty cool.
9132369	9133249	What else was in the game room?
9134550	9140654	They had a bunch of scrolling shooters like Radiant Silvergun and Gradius.
9141260	9144641	One of my friends brought his Tetris and Grandmaster arcade board so I got to play that.
9144661	9148483	I didn't really use my DS so much this year, but I will say this for Bomani fans, I'll
9167521	9170122	The arcade finally had an actual version of poppin' music.
9170462	9172103	Not NMLO2, thankfully.
9174204	9174424	Hmm.
9174744	9175044	Alright.
9175524	9176865	Matt, go ahead.
9177185	9180246	Yeah, instead of poppin' music, NMLO2 did poppin' 14.
9181086	9181546	That's good.
9183147	9184027	That's definitely worthwhile.
9185788	9186608	How about anime stuff?
9186628	9189849	I know we don't talk a lot about anime on this show, but did you see some cool stuff going on?
9189889	9191650	Any cool panels that you saw?
9192330	9193731	I know we weren't there this year, but...
9194827	9201051	I went to one gathering, but it wasn't as good as the same one from last year, and I went to a panel called Bonsai Arcade.
9201091	9206335	It was a video game trivia show panel thingy, and it was pretty awesome.
9207456	9213740	That's one thing I really want to get into doing at these cons, is these game show type things, because I think it would be a lot of fun.
9214000	9218003	Like, a lot of references to, like, older video, like, 16-bit video games, like,
9222555	9233179	Your questions are represented by enemies, and so do enemies or versions of enemies from older games like Mr. Batty from Earthbound or Dr. Robotnik from 12 Balls and Chains.
9233956	9237979	or just Labyrinth Zone Dance Party thing where if you get the question right, it ends.
9238099	9240681	But if you get it wrong, you get a sonic drown and you get to get it drowned.
9242122	9242762	Interesting.
9243343	9244424	Some people have a lot of time.
9245044	9246165	A lot of free time on their hands.
9246225	9250928	You know what's... I gotta say this because I don't think I ever said this about Anime Central when I was talking about this.
9251128	9252269	That was the most recent con I went to.
9252609	9262096	But one of the panels that they were supposed to do was like live recreations of cases from Phoenix Wright where they were going to basically do the cases from Phoenix Wright as a play.
9262156	9263217	At least that's how it read in the book.
9263277	9264577	I remember that one.
9265698	9267678	Even though I went to the Ace Attorney Gathering.
9268258	9270279	It was not what we thought it would be.
9270359	9273659	We tried to go there to the panel and it was hard to hear.
9274079	9276220	They weren't really reading off a script.
9276240	9277400	They were just kind of making it up.
9277440	9278880	It seems we left after five minutes.
9278900	9282721	We were like, god damn it, this seemed so much better in the panel.
9282741	9283641	This could have been epic.
9284942	9285422	Objection!
9285782	9288042	They could have gone off the script from the game and it would have been beautiful.
9288062	9288483	Yeah, what else?
9291409	9304619	I went to cosplay chess, which is like basically you have a chess board, two people playing chess, and then you have a bigger chess board where they represent the chess gameplay on the huge board with cosplayers.
9304699	9305480	That was pretty fun.
9307362	9309323	Any good video game cosplay that you saw?
9309343	9311545	A whole lot.
9311585	9316969	Hold on, let me just post my pictures from fun in the chat room.
9316989	9319371	That's at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
9320520	9322341	If you want to check that out, I see the link there.
9323481	9331004	Yeah, I saw a few video game cosplay gatherings, and I cosplayed as a character myself, and that was kind of funny.
9331825	9334906	Like, I went in my Paul Justice cosplay, and a lot of people recognized me.
9335266	9338648	And I went in my Poppin' cosplay, and like, only three people recognized me.
9339108	9341189	Then again, I wasn't really surprised.
9342369	9344850	What would you say was the best video game cosplay you saw?
9346411	9347131	I'm not sure.
9348812	9349092	Like,
9352024	9362331	Yeah, I saw Captain Commander cosplay, and that's pretty cool, because the cosplayer had neon lights on his costume, which was awesome.
9363312	9364312	Alright, fair enough.
9364713	9367875	Well, GS68, any other thoughts about Fandomay before we let you go and take some more calls?
9371817	9375380	Yeah, I went to YaoiCon Bingo for the hell of it.
9375820	9378542	I didn't win anything, but... YaoiCon Bingo...
9379386	9379666	Yes.
9380727	9383588	This sounds like one of those things I have to experience at least once in my life.
9383628	9386709	I've heard of YaoiCon for probably 10 years now, and I've never really gone.
9386729	9387369	You probably should.
9387709	9389290	I've been to YaoiCon before, Rob.
9389310	9390010	It's interesting.
9390110	9390770	Maybe at some point.
9390790	9393611	Yeah, I might go to YaoiCon this year, but only for one day.
9394452	9396292	Same with SakAnime's summer version.
9397273	9397573	Okay.
9398313	9401234	Well, maybe with SakAnime's in our neck of the woods, we haven't been there in forever.
9401334	9401634	We'll see.
9402015	9402235	All right.
9402535	9404235	We've got to let you go, though, so we can get some more calls.
9404255	9404976	But thank you so much, GS68.
9405036	9408077	I'm glad to hear you had a fun time at Faname, and we should be back next year.
9409168	9410490	Alright, see you next year then.
9410570	9410770	Later.
9432552	9433732	You know what I meant.
9434672	9437353	I know, but you opened the door for me.
9437393	9438553	You don't do that.
9438693	9439193	I did.
9439333	9443034	Hey, you got me back for the purple spaceship from earlier in the show, so there you go.
9443054	9444074	Oh, that was a good play.
9444154	9444594	I loved it.
9444614	9445315	That was a good play.
9445755	9449575	The chat room is telling me to hang up on you for that, so you better talk quick to save yourself.
9449616	9450316	What else is on your mind?
9451776	9452316	Two words.
9452596	9453676	Animate Boston.
9453916	9454156	All right.
9454196	9455077	How was Animate Boston?
9455097	9456917	Between.
9457776	9458056	and many more.
9485490	9486491	Penny Arcade Expo East Coast Version
9506443	9508945	I've been saying no, no, and no.
9509205	9517432	Because the convention center holds maybe between 10,000 to 15,000 people, and AB has hit anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000.
9518093	9519253	It has been jam-packed.
9519654	9522816	If they do it right, they may be able to pull it off.
9522976	9530262	If not, when you get there late Friday afternoon or Friday evening, don't be too surprised to see signs on the door that says, filled to capacity due to fire code.
9531523	9531824	Wow.
9532899	9536723	Rob D in chat clarifies they are estimating 20,000 people for PAX East.
9536763	9537364	They're insane.
9538645	9541708	And if that's the case, the Heinz might just be able to pull it off.
9542009	9543130	It's three floors.
9543230	9545412	It's not tremendously huge as like…
9546107	9549630	The Baltimore Convention Center, which can hold about 24,000 people.
9550010	9551932	I can see the Hinds maybe half that.
9552052	9557196	They'll probably spill into some neighboring facilities and some of the hotels that I imagine are right nearby there.
9557216	9558437	That's kind of what ASEN does.
9558777	9561780	They have the convention center, but they also spill into the nearby hotels.
9561980	9565383	So I'm sure PAX will do something like that if there's that much demand there.
9566003	9571428	Yeah, because there's two hotels attached to the Hinds, and there's two more hotels within walking distance.
9572368	9572749	Interesting.
9574316	9575457	Anything else on your mind tonight?
9576217	9580599	Or actually, I want to ask you real quick, what did you see at Anime Boston gaming-wise that you wanted to share with us?
9581980	9583581	DDR4th Mix Plus Machine.
9584201	9584862	Epic win.
9584942	9585702	I missed that one.
9587803	9592646	And I also discovered what the whole Nintendo booth was, and since you went to ASA, you probably saw it too.
9592866	9593066	Hmm.
9595558	9596098	You didn't see it?
9596518	9598339	No, what, the Nintendo booth?
9598980	9600520	Yeah, it was in the dealer's room.
9600540	9602301	They had a complete display for Fire Emblem.
9602321	9602721	Yes, they did.
9602742	9605623	They were selling the hell out of that new Fire Emblem game, yeah.
9606423	9607344	Yes, yes it was.
9607724	9608004	Indeed.
9608044	9614727	I keep forgetting that I thought that was the makers, I guess it was Nintendo publishing it, but I thought for some reason, I don't know, it didn't click in my mind.
9615228	9615768	I'm slow.
9616548	9617989	But yeah, I definitely saw that on the floor.
9618029	9619290	They were a very popular booth.
9620458	9623939	All right, well, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get in some more calls and then go wrap up the show.
9624019	9625359	So thanks so much for calling, okay?
9626060	9626500	Ain't no problem.
9626520	9627000	Take care, guys.
9627020	9627340	Later, bud.
9628000	9628160	Later.
9628961	9632082	All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype.
9632562	9635302	Orange Lounge Radio is the phone number to call.
9637203	9639384	We'll take a few more calls before we leave you guys tonight.
9641564	9643085	I just answered one and they hung up right away.
9643105	9646966	I think somebody is redialing so fast that they're not actually able to get through.
9647646	9648907	I think we got one call here, though.
9648947	9649827	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9649847	9650147	Who's this?
9651121	9652021	This is Ingo.
9652382	9653062	Hey, Ingo.
9653122	9653662	What's good?
9653702	9654683	I was wondering how to say that.
9654723	9655703	What's on your mind, Ingo?
9656824	9658584	Um, nothing really much.
9659084	9663727	Um, I was wondering, is it really worth 200 bucks to get a three?
9664747	9667028	I already have a PS3, but I was just wondering.
9668390	9673671	The golden rule of gaming we've said time and again here on Orange Launch Radio is a console is only as good as the games that are on it.
9674171	9680872	You have to really look at what's available on the Xbox 360 and you have to look, are these games that I can't get on the PlayStation 3?
9681733	9685113	Or are these games giving me an experience I can't get on the PlayStation 3?
9685693	9688434	And I'm phrasing it like that to you because you already own a PlayStation 3.
9688954	9692955	Most people are usually going the other way around where they already have the Xbox, they want to get the PlayStation 3, or...
9693595	9694416	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9711656	9716039	But since you already have that, you're really going to have to look at the Xbox exclusive games.
9716159	9717821	Are you somebody that plays Halo?
9718161	9724746	Are you somebody that plays Mass Effect 1 and some of these other games that are exclusive on Xbox 360?
9725306	9726847	I'm having a total brain lapse right now.
9726867	9727668	What are some of the other games?
9727788	9728528	Gears of War.
9728588	9729989	Gears of War, DDR Universe.
9730250	9730630	Fable 2.
9732291	9733492	Are these games of interest to you?
9734922	9736723	I'll have to think about it for a little bit.
9736823	9739205	Just some exclusive.
9739285	9742307	Well, here's my question to you, and you should ask yourself the same thing.
9742647	9746549	If I were to drop $200 on Xbox 360, what would be the first game I'd play on it?
9748490	9750532	For me, it'd probably be Grand Theft Auto 4.
9751728	9752389	Well, there you go.
9752689	9756452	But see, Grand Theft Auto 4 is also a game that you can get on the PlayStation 3.
9757313	9760455	But, of course, Xbox 360 also has the multiplayer.
9761476	9763197	They have the multiplayer in the PS3 as well.
9763217	9764198	They have expansions.
9764238	9765739	That's pretty much it for right now.
9766560	9768421	The multiplayer on the PS3 sucks.
9770783	9780491	Are you happy with the PlayStation 3 or are you a little disgruntled with where they've gone with it and that's why you're thinking about maybe going to Xbox?
9781536	9796102	I'm really happy with my PS3, uh, because, uh, well, yeah, I, I don't know why, but, no, I really shouldn't, until, uh, Twitter went down, then, uh, but, hey, I got a 500 gig, uh, PS3 now, so.
9798354	9799435	Nice, a modded PS3.
9799455	9804298	And hey, maybe you can get one of those phones where you can stream your pornography to anywhere you want in the world over 3G.
9805378	9806539	No, I'm not one of those people.
9806919	9807199	Alright.
9809161	9811542	I'm trying to think of what else I want to ask you in regards to this.
9811562	9816025	Wait until after E3 and then they'll announce all their new games and you can see if there's anything that tickles your fancy.
9816625	9818786	That's a really good point as well.
9818826	9825567	With all these rumors of the motion control device and everything that Xbox is supposed to be coming out, maybe that's going to be your incentive.
9825667	9827567	There also might be a price drop or two.
9827928	9833269	Definitely don't buy anything until at least after noon tomorrow after the press conference.
9834809	9836289	If you can wait that long.
9836349	9840190	If you were to tell me that, Loki, and I really wanted an Xbox 360, I'd be like, no, I can't wait that long.
9840490	9840990	I want it now.
9841631	9842231	I'll pay the extra $100.
9842631	9842951	I don't care.
9842991	9843391	I want it now.
9844639	9849062	I mean, any of us that buy a console the first day it comes out, we all know the damn thing's going to drop.
9849082	9850443	I don't know what you're talking about.
9850483	9851044	Exactly.
9851984	9854306	Who was it that paid how much for an Xbox 360?
9854926	9854306	$700.
9854947	9855627	That's what I thought.
9855667	9856207	Thank you very much.
9856287	9857388	I also own five of them.
9857408	9858129	Thank you very much.
9858209	9858689	Case in point.
9859490	9860030	Sorry, Ingo.
9861591	9862932	Well, good luck to you.
9862952	9865954	I hope you are able to figure it out.
9865995	9869557	And let us know if you do end up buying the Xbox 360 and what you do play on it.
9870138	9871939	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9873144	9878586	Um, Loki, uh, you should check your friend requests on your PS3.
9879867	9885549	I haven't been on my PS3 in, well, I have been on my PS3, but not browsing games.
9886289	9887470	We've been streaming the porn.
9887510	9888670	Watching porn, exactly.
9888690	9892732	No, we've been streaming movies out of it, um, but yeah, I haven't been on PlayStation Network in a while.
9893615	9896136	BlackWolf would like to remind everybody that he is Loki's only friend.
9896276	9897557	Not anymore, BlackWolf.
9897697	9898117	Sorry.
9898397	9899337	Oh, you cheated on him.
9899837	9900818	I would cry if I were Bobby.
9901118	9904379	All right, Ingo, we're going to let you go to get a couple more calls and get out of here, but have a good night, okay?
9905100	9905440	You too.
9905600	9905960	Later, bud.
9907381	9907941	What was I going to say?
9908221	9912182	TheRobD in chat says, because motion on the three... Oh, actually, this is his call.
9912202	9913023	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9913043	9913363	Who's this?
9914414	9922971	What's up guys, it's the Rob D I was just about to read one of your comments in chat Because motion on the 360 is going to be good Laugh What if it is, Rob
9925067	9929191	Um, then I'll gladly eat crow, but I really doubt it's actually going to be good.
9929371	9931533	You think it's going to be anything more than a gimmick?
9931793	9933574	It's a cup of mayonnaise tonight, Rob.
9933614	9935256	I don't know if you were here earlier in the night.
9935276	9946205	Honestly, there is going to be a motion controller, regardless of this camera thing, because the third-party game accessory developer PDP is putting out their magic wand controller thing.
9946525	9948707	It has a game that comes with it called Squeeballs.
9949868	9951169	And it looks like the Wii remote.
9951509	9952670	It's got, yeah...
9953420	9955241	As long as I can waggle my squeeballs, I'll be good.
9957261	9957581	Wow.
9958181	9960822	You know, there could be something good out of this.
9960962	9961462	I don't know.
9961762	9963723	You know, it might be a hell of a party thing.
9963843	9967124	I don't think it's something I'm going to sit there and play in the room by myself.
9967384	9968804	Look at me flailing about like an asshole.
9968824	9970225	Oh my god, can we get a Totem Ball sequel?
9970925	9974006	Can I buy another useless camera?
9974186	9977606	I somehow don't think Rob called in tonight to talk about Microsoft Motion Control.
9977646	9978587	Let me turn it over to Rob.
9978627	9979467	What's on your mind tonight?
9980496	9985017	I have to ask you guys to bear with me a little bit because I'm currently sick and I'm coughing all over the place.
9985837	9988238	I have no voice and I've been doing the show all night tonight, so it's fine.
9988938	9992539	Would you like your third convention report of the night since I went to Anime North in Toronto?
9993439	9996260	Apparently we are the convention hub on the internet.
9996300	9997480	I guess so.
9997560	9999661	We should just name ourselves the convention cast.
9999681	10000121	That's all right.
10000421	10000861	How was it?
10002035	10002515	It was fun.
10002835	10004157	Toronto was actually a really cool city.
10004197	10005638	It's the first time I've been there in about a decade.
10007019	10012704	Though they don't really care too much for copyright infringement, as you can see from the picture I just posted in chat, which is hilarious.
10014205	10021672	It was a great place to have a convention, even though it was a little bit outside the city, but I managed to have a friend show me around anyway.
10023274	10023494	Mario Bros.
10023534	10023775	Fast Foods
10039178	10041659	Do they serve Mario broth soup there or something?
10041679	10042199	What the hell?
10043020	10043460	I don't know.
10043620	10045560	You can actually see they're under renovation.
10045580	10050862	I would have totally eaten there, but I decided to eat this little concoction for lunch instead.
10051322	10052143	Something called poutine.
10053083	10053843	Oh, God, yes.
10053923	10054463	I've heard of this.
10054544	10057384	It's like the french fries and gravy, right?
10057505	10058945	French fries, cheese curds, and gravy.
10060225	10061906	If that doesn't stop your heart, I don't know what will.
10062346	10063767	But either way, the convention, though.
10063887	10066408	Instant pancreas attack right there if I eat that.
10066468	10067328	Sorry, convention, yes.
10067765	10067925	Yes.
10068426	10068646	Wow.
10088871	10090071	Video game related, the game room.
10090291	10093032	I know this is a theme with me lately, but the game room kind of sucked.
10093612	10097253	You know how you said it's great when the conventions actually spill over into the surrounding hotels?
10098514	10101094	It's not so great when that surrounding hotel is a half mile away.
10101815	10102975	Oh, yeah, that's not good.
10103015	10104675	That sounds very Anime Expo.
10105956	10106936	Which is why I quit going.
10108206	10115429	Yeah, I went over there for most of Saturday, and of course they ended up scrapping the Street Fighter IV tournament three hours after it was supposed to start, but I'm not bitter.
10115769	10116130	Not at all.
10118951	10126054	I went there in the morning, and all they had to play was Brawl, a pinball game on the PS2, I don't even know what it was, and SBC Chaos.
10126314	10128855	Oh, and Ikaruga, which is... I guess that's fine.
10129355	10130556	But the real highlight of the convention...
10131036	10138441	was me taking a picture with the voice of Link, Nobuyuki Hiyama, and the voice of Joe Higashi, the voice of Iroh, the voice of Siegfried from Soul Calibur.
10139341	10142003	They got some pretty good celebs up there in Canada, don't they?
10142543	10143064	I know, right?
10143884	10144224	Wow.
10144965	10145685	That was a ton of fun.
10145985	10147186	I'm looking at the picture right now.
10147326	10147846	There you are.
10148347	10148827	There he is.
10149788	10151269	Too bad it wasn't the voice of Navi.
10151429	10152429	Hey, listen.
10152810	10153670	Hey, listen.
10154010	10156172	I would love to get that person to do a bumper for OLR.
10156832	10157833	Hey, listen.
10158273	10158793	Hey, listen.
10158813	10159193	To OLR.
10159494	10159934	To OLR.
10162466	10165528	Sorry, I don't know what the hell possessed me for that.
10166850	10178799	So on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blow your mind awesome con of the year, like better than Penny Arcade Expo, 1 being, oh my god, this sucked, where would you rate this convention?
10179719	10180979	I'd rate it at about a solid 8.
10181079	10188101	I expect Otakon to be better, because last year at Otakon was just a really great experience, and especially since I have a panel at Otakon this year, it's going to be a ton of fun.
10188141	10189242	Of course, that makes everything better.
10189262	10190542	A Rob D panel makes everything better.
10190582	10192062	The only thing better than a Rob D panel?
10192823	10193423	A Rob Roberts panel.
10193443	10193983	Is a Sky panel?
10194003	10194403	That's right.
10195923	10196644	I'm just messing.
10197104	10201885	All right, Rob, we've got to let you go so we can go wrap up the show, but thank you for making our show now with more poutine.
10202381	10202961	I appreciate that.
10203381	10203741	You know it.
10204122	10204362	All right.
10204402	10204762	Take care, buddy.
10204782	10206142	You always need more French fries and cheese curds.
10206302	10206582	All right.
10206703	10207343	Take care, buddy.
10207463	10207963	See you later, man.
10208063	10208223	Bye.
10208283	10209363	All right.
10209383	10210984	We're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line tonight.
10211024	10215786	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're at about 920 in between this and our afterbirth and everything.
10216466	10217546	We don't want to be here too late tonight.
10218007	10220427	So we're going to go ahead and go around and wrap everything up.
10221008	10223348	Remember, if you guys didn't get through, we do need more emails always.
10223468	10224129	Put Jamie to work.
10224469	10227030	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send it.
10227050	10227670	I'm not here to work.
10227950	10229431	ESRB is rated Final Fantasy 7 for the PS3 and PSP.
10229451	10231773	Basically the PlayStation Network version of it where you can download the PlayStation 1 game.
10250946	10260749	Most people's guess is that it's going to come out with the release of the Blu-ray of Final Fantasy Advent Children Complete, since that's when it came out in Japan, so in a few more weeks.
10262609	10269611	Another surprise Sony-related, apparently there was a Sony PlayStation Blog E3 2009 meetup in LA.
10270011	10275273	Well, apparently the first hundred people in line also got E3 passes, so lucky them.
10276193	10276313	Um...
10278462	10279304	Let's see here.
10279885	10280868	That is very lucky.
10280948	10283654	I would like to know if any of our listeners were one of those hundred people.
10284436	10286501	Remember, I'm looking for hugs at E3 if you are.

10309264	10309965	Yes, it is.
10311026	10321074	Ubisoft is bringing more game show based games to the Wii, including Press Your Luck, Family Feud, and they're going to do another Price is Right game.
10321655	10322275	Fuck no.
10322916	10325058	I'm just kidding.
10325098	10327020	I haven't played the Price is Right game.
10327340	10328261	It might be interesting.
10328837	10350186	by the way completely unrelated but I have to ask did anyone see that clip on the internet of the Price is Right episode from last week where this contestant got so excited she jumped up on Drew Carey and kneed him in the balls oh my god like it was an accident thing she didn't mean to do it but she totally kneed him in the balls and took him down like he was like oh my god I think it was on TMZ or something if you have to see it it's hilarious sorry completely random but fuck yes to press your luck
10352647	10360114	They have a Splinter Cell banner, of course, outside of the LA Convention Center, kind of confirming still that it's an Xbox 360 exclusive.
10361236	10362357	No big surprise there.
10363538	10367061	And some other homebrew stuff, actually, interesting.
10367722	10370424	There's a project someone's working on called Metroid 2.5.
10370464	10372646	It's going to be kind of a 2.5D version of Metroid 2 and kind of 3.
10376650	10380434	Oh, in other words, what Metroid on the GameCube should have been, in my opinion.
10380995	10383217	There's a lot of Prime fans that would disagree with me.
10383237	10385119	It's quite different than what you would think.
10385220	10385840	It's actually...
10387449	10396775	It's really weird, like he can kind of, like Super Paper Mario almost, but, like, you know, not Metroid, Mega Man, I'm sorry, Mega Man 2.5.
10396935	10400798	Oh, well, you just changed everything, alright, Mega Man.
10400818	10401739	Not Metroid.
10401959	10408043	No, there is still Metroid 2.5 type of game that's coming out that someone's making, that Metroid 2 fusion thing.
10409123	10410184	That looked interesting.
10410204	10410244	Um...
10411625	10412346	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10435356	10436918	Well, the ROM leaked out.
10437038	10438640	I fucking told you this would happen.
10438680	10441684	I fucking said it that night that we covered this story.
10441724	10444748	It's going to leak anyway, and they're going to be like, oops, I didn't know.
10444848	10445849	Sorry, guys.
10445889	10447751	Didn't mean to.
10447871	10449093	We all knew it was going to come out anyway.
10449113	10454860	Originally, they thought, though, it was going to be the 98% finished version of it, but now it's an alpha version of it, so it's not
10455285	10457286	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10477451	10479571	I'm not surprised one bit that that came out.
10479811	10481632	And there's millions of people downloading it now, I'm sure.
10482432	10484073	I better include myself.
10484273	10486634	I know, I'm like, things to do when I get home.
10487454	10492956	And then finally, there's a new music game coming out from the founders of Rockstar Games.
10493376	10494997	Actually, founders of...
10495851	10496191	Yippee!
10496231	10496431	Alright!
10515066	10515766	We're getting out of here.
10515946	10517187	We're done for the night.
10517207	10517387	Are we?
10517567	10518287	We got to wrap up.
10518327	10521448	Yeah, we got to do our live-only segment real quick and then get out of here.
10521468	10523329	It's almost 10 o'clock on the West Coast, if you can believe it.
10523649	10525090	Long show tonight, but we had a lot of news.
10525130	10525790	What did you expect?
10526310	10526650	Really?
10526730	10528611	I mean, we've got E3 coming up.
10528691	10529171	Exactly.
10529191	10530152	Wait till next time.
10530172	10533773	And if we are here next Sunday, which I don't see why we wouldn't be, but we'll see.
10534113	10534593	We'll see.
10534653	10536094	Maybe like a short show Sunday.
10536194	10537454	That's what I'm thinking is going to happen.
10538634	10543215	Maybe we'll do – well, we'll talk because I know Bobby might want to go along because this is his 200th show.
10543255	10544536	We'll worry about it later.
10544896	10546976	I know we've got to do some type of E3 impression show.
10547017	10547457	We've got to.
10548797	10551438	And Dark Sakura, since you're not going, you've got to keep an eye on it from home.
10552178	10552638	I guess.
10552858	10554679	And keep an eye on all the blogs and all that fun stuff.
10554839	10555159	I guess.
10555259	10555499	All right.
10557219	10558640	Anyhow, let's see.
10558680	10559020	We're going to –
10560666	10561747	Wrap up and get on out of here.
10562107	10563208	Everybody's final thought tonight.
10563248	10564209	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
10564249	10564769	Your final thought.
10565930	10567271	I made my garage too big.
10568892	10569813	Loki, your final thought.
10570353	10572755	I have to play more Fuel and then kill some Sims.
10574148	10576049	My final thought is I got to check out this fuel as well.
10576190	10579172	And I'm looking forward to going to E3.
10579412	10582274	And remember, I'm looking for hugs and just to meet more people.
10582614	10586416	So if you do happen to see me out there at E3, please stop and say hello.
10586657	10587717	Post it.
10587977	10589118	I promise I'm not mean.
10589839	10590659	Just come up and say hi.
10590699	10591260	Introduce yourself.
10591840	10593341	Ask anyone who met me at ASEN or anything.
10593421	10594242	I swear I'm not mean.
10594742	10596423	But I am.
10596503	10597464	Yes, but Loki is.
10597504	10598584	So avoid him at all costs.
10598725	10599345	I am too.
10599405	10603328	But if I'm with Loki, then you're okay because I will keep him in check and he won't be mean to you.
10604908	10607209	In reality, actually, Loki's one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.
10607229	10608270	It's just a radio persona.
10608470	10609050	It's all a lie.
10609570	10610270	It's all a lie.
10610391	10611511	I'm absolutely mean.
10611911	10617413	I hate to break it to you guys here, but the mean guy persona is all a lie.
10617673	10617873	Great.
10617893	10620875	They're going to have Tony Hawk's ride at the Microsoft E3 keynote.
10621255	10622695	That's going to be boring to watch.
10622795	10623355	Hooray.
10624116	10628497	Maybe that's why they suddenly did the five-minute increase or whatever in time.
10629398	10632419	TheRobD in chat says, Sky punched me in the face and threw a drink at me.
10634201	10635302	in true diva fashion.
10635782	10636102	All right.
10636802	10637803	No, really, we're out of here.
10637903	10638523	Thanks, you guys.
