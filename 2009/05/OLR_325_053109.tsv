0	20360	Today, May 31, 2009, the PSP Go gets confirmed a bit early, Matrix Online decides to pull
20360	29760	the plug, and on the eve of the expo we go over all the E3 leaks and rumors.
29760	35240	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35240	36240	Radio.
36240	40600	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
40600	41600	lifestyle.
41600	43820	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.
43820	48040	Say hello as well to my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48040	50860	How are you doing?
50860	52000	At least you have a voice.
52000	54720	My voice is leaving, I had a busy weekend.
54720	57280	I should make you some coffee or some tea or something.
57280	58640	Coffee would be awesome actually.
58640	60080	Why don't I make some coffee?
60080	61080	That would be super.
61080	62680	I will do that after I announce my gaming week.
62680	65480	Yeah, I was going to say, we're trying to do a show right now, so maybe we'll get into
65480	66480	that in a little bit.
66480	68480	I will, I will use my sensio.
68480	69480	Awesome.
69480	70480	Awesome.
70480	76040	I can't wait for hot coffee, fresh from DarkSakura.
76040	78280	On second thought, go get yourself.
78280	81580	Also say hello to TechMasterLoki who has a thread on his shirt that's bugging the hell
81580	82580	out of me.
82580	83580	There it is.
83580	85080	Why did she do that?
85080	87080	Should I put it back?
87080	88080	No.
88080	89080	I see.
89080	90080	How are you?
90080	91080	That's what wives are supposed to do.
91080	92080	How are you, TechMasterLoki?
92080	93080	I'm doing fine.
93080	94080	Yeah?
94080	95080	That's what I try to do.
95080	96080	Been busy.
96080	97080	I think your mic is off, Loki.
97080	98080	I'm not.
98080	99080	That's right, I turned it off.
99080	100080	There you go.
100080	101080	I forgot that I did that too.
101080	102080	Oh, well, welcome back.
102080	103840	Apparently you're gone one week and you forget how the damn show works.
103840	104840	Yes.
104840	105840	Just kidding.
105840	106840	All right, so how are you doing, Loki?
106840	108400	I've been busy.
108400	109400	Yes, been busy?
109400	110400	Getting ready for E3?
110400	111400	Uh, no.
111400	112400	No.
112400	113400	Me neither.
113400	117120	I am so not ready for E3, which is actually why I'm kind of excited that I don't have
117120	118440	a lot of commitments.
118440	122800	The great thing about you and I, and unfortunately Dark Soccer can't go this year, but hopefully
122800	124200	next year she can go again.
124200	129240	The great thing about us going to E3 is that we don't answer to nobody.
129240	132240	We only answer to you guys, the listeners, really direct what we do.
132240	134200	And we don't answer to them either.
134200	136160	Sometimes we decide not to listen to them either.
136160	137160	No, I'm kidding.
137160	138160	I'm kidding.
138160	140760	But I mean, if we're going to let anybody boss us around, it's the listeners.
140760	141980	You know what I mean?
141980	147880	We don't have anybody to, you know, nobody pays us to cover or write or edit video or
147880	148880	any of that stuff.
148880	149880	And why not?
149880	150880	We just kind of get to do whatever.
150880	151880	Someone should pay us.
151880	154880	Well, but if they did, then we'd have that responsibility.
154880	160120	And I kind of like the fact that we're going to E3 as gamers to just soak it all in, see
160120	163680	what interests us outside of all the media hype.
163680	167320	Maybe we're going to find something in a dark corner somewhere that gets half a page
167320	172000	right up on sites that are way overlooked and all the PSP Go and whatever other news
172000	173360	is going to come out of E3.
173360	174720	And you know, we can focus on that.
174720	177880	And that's going to be the cool thing about E3, I think this year.
177880	183080	Because right now, I have to admit you guys, E3 this year, I'm not feeling it as much as
183080	184480	I have in years past.
184480	187760	And I know there's a lot of people that are like, you effing bastard.
187760	190720	You know, I have always wanted to go to E3.
190720	193720	And you're sitting there going, well, I'm going to E3, but I don't feel kind of half
193720	195000	asked about it this year.
195000	199900	From my perspective, in my defense a little bit, you know, this used to be a big deal.
199900	203480	Like everybody I knew, knew went to E3.
203480	207740	And this year, like not even, I think it's the economy plays a big part in it.
207740	208960	Not even Dark Soccer is going.
208960	212140	One of our own hosts here on the show is not able to go to the show.
212140	215660	And like, you know, it's a choice not to go to the show, right?
215660	220680	And none of my friends, you know, outside of the three of us are really going except
220680	225480	for some of my long distance friends like Bobby and, you know, Kropotkin and some of
225480	228280	the, you know, All Games people are going to be there.
228280	230960	But I'm talking about, you know, some of my local friends, there used to be like 10 of
230960	232640	us that would go and none of them are going.
232640	234960	So it's kind of weird this year.
234960	237320	I'm going to feel a little lonely at E3.
237320	242520	So if you happen to be going to E3, I might need a hug because I'm feeling a little lonely
242520	243520	this year.
243520	244520	All right, everyone.
244520	245520	Yay.
245520	248160	And you know how we used to have the kick in UltraCade?
248160	249160	This is a hug-a-rob.
249160	256400	So everyone go around, hug Rob, post your pictures to pixx.com.
256400	259360	And just remind me that I don't have to be alone.
259360	262760	Give Rob some love before he cries like an emo child.
262760	267440	I don't know why I'm feeling weird about E3 this year, but I know, you know what, it's
267440	268440	going to be the same as every year.
268440	270340	I'm going to get to LA and I'm going to have a blast.
270340	275840	You know, because this, you guys have to understand, you know, I'm a normal gamer person just like
275840	276840	the rest of you.
276840	277840	Don't get paid to do this stuff.
277840	278840	I don't understand, Rob.
278840	282600	It's just, it's one of those things where I do this all the time with trips.
282600	285800	Even right before I went to ASEN, Chicago, I was like dragging my feet.
285800	287360	Like, why the hell did I sign up to do this?
287360	288480	Why am I going to Chicago?
288480	289520	Oh my God.
289520	292080	Like I'm just, this is just getting in the way right now.
292080	295160	I don't have, and then once the plane landed, I was like, woo, I'm in another city.
295160	296160	I'm having fun.
296160	299280	You know, I'm meeting so many new people.
299280	300280	But what?
300280	301840	You have lesbians to hang out with.
301840	305600	I know, and I got to see the lesbians there, but the lesbians aren't going to E3.
305600	308720	How is E3 supposed to be any fun without lesbians?
308720	309720	Hopefully there's some lesbians at E3 somewhere.
309720	310720	Every convention needs more gay.
310720	312840	I need a hug from lesbians at E3.
312840	313840	That's what I need.
313840	315120	Every convention is better with more gay.
315120	316320	Enough of my whining.
316320	318320	Let me introduce the chat room as well.
318320	320440	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
320440	322800	And look, I got a hug from Retertainment already in chat.
322800	323800	A nice virtual hug.
323800	325880	Well, thank you guys very much.
325880	330040	And from Milma13120 as well.
330040	332120	So hooray for hugs and hooray for new people.
332120	336160	I see a lot of people in the chat that I have not seen before, so I think we have some new
336160	337160	listeners.
337160	341520	I think CyberBeast41 I think was saying he's in Belgium and listening for the first time.
341520	342680	So welcome.
342680	343680	I like Belgium.
343680	345000	I've never been there, but I like it.
345000	347720	We like having, I like the fries.
347720	352480	We like having new, and waffles, I'm just kidding, but we like having new listeners.
352480	353980	It's pretty cool.
353980	354980	And new people in chat.
354980	358760	And I think maybe part of that has to do with the podcast feed being so far behind.
358760	362620	And God, I hate that it's become habit here at OLR, but I swear there's a good reason
362620	364560	for it and I will get to it in just a moment.
364560	367160	But I do want to get into how we always start off the show.
367160	368160	How was your gaming week?
368160	369760	DarkSoccer, how was your gaming week?
369760	375600	My gaming week was pretty much The Sims, as I'm doing right now.
375600	377400	Awesome.
377400	386280	And actually, I did do some looking into Sims 3, so I'm very, very much looking forward
386280	388160	to getting my hands on that.
388160	391640	And you know, we do have to remember, there might be some people out there going, oh my
391640	395960	gosh, The Sims, but The Sims is like the best selling PC game ever.
395960	401240	So you know, we do have to remember that there is a huge audience for these games.
401240	402320	And a lot of anticipation.
402320	405800	I don't know about your neck of the woods, folks, but I was seeing a bunch of billboards
405800	407580	in the Bay Area this weekend for Sims 3.
407580	410160	They have this whole Let There Be Sims campaign going on.
410160	414360	So this is setting up to be a big event, and it's all next week, same time as E3.
414360	418920	I'll be honest, I actually, you know, the biggest thing that I like to do, and I quit
418920	423160	playing it because that was all I was doing for a while, it's pretty much the thing that
423160	425120	I like to do is make houses.
425120	427540	I love designing shit.
427540	429480	I love designing shit.
429480	432840	I mean, I guess maybe that's why I'm in school for it, maybe?
432840	438220	But the most fun for me has really been, you know, getting these bizarro little houses
438220	439220	and putting them together.
439220	441400	I've been greatly, greatly enjoying it.
441400	446080	You know, I can sympathize, DarkSakura, because that's why I love Quake Live, because I love
446080	448120	shooting people in the face.
448120	449120	And that's what I'm trying to-
449120	450120	I love shooting people in the face, too!
450120	453400	That's what I'm trying to study in school, is shooting people in the face.
453400	454400	But they don't-
454400	455400	What a coincidence!
455400	456400	I had to make my own major for that.
456400	459600	That's part of, that's actually part of a designer's job, is shooting their clients
459600	461440	in the face when they're belligerent.
461440	462440	I'm sorry, I'm kidding.
462440	463800	That won't get me any clients, will it?
463800	466600	Obviously, I'm just teasing DarkSakura.
466600	468840	That was a little parody there.
468840	472280	I was parodying your parody.
472280	474320	I was parodizing your parody.
474320	476360	I consider my parody parodied.
476360	480280	Yeah, I'm gonna get your coffee now.
480280	481280	Alright, yay!
481280	483600	Good, because I don't want you to hear about my gaming week.
483600	486600	Loki, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
486600	489600	I only played really two different things.
489600	491920	First being the modified version of Grand Theft Auto IV.
491920	498640	We're still tweaking it to get it just right, but now we have flying police cars, super
498640	504720	ambulances, guns that shoot fire, guns that shoot explosions, guns that shoot blasts of
504720	507520	air that launch people into the air.
507520	509880	So it's been a lot of fun.
509880	514440	I'm actually looking forward to one of the stories we're gonna get into later where they're
514440	518520	actually gonna have the expansions on their own disc, because then I can actually edit
518520	523840	everything in Lost and Damned and the new expansions, so that'll be cool.
523840	531320	And then today I decided to play my copy of Fuel that I got a little early, and that's
531320	532320	actually really fun.
532320	540600	And when they tell you that it has 1,800 square kilometers in the game, it does, and it feels
540600	541600	like it.
541600	544720	And it actually breaks it down to 19 different zones in the game.
544720	548960	The one you start off in, when you look at the map it doesn't look that big, but then
548960	552800	when you actually try driving in it, it's huge.
552800	556120	And one of the achievements is actually driving from the first outpost that you get to the
556120	558560	next outpost you unlock.
558560	560320	And it took me a good 30 minutes to drive that.
560320	566560	And I'm talking the most direct route I could possibly take, not on roads, just going straight
566560	570560	towards the next outpost, over mountains, everything.
570560	573960	It's just insane, the size of the game.
573960	577600	And what's even better, though, is the fact that you don't really have to do the races,
577600	582120	because there's actually, the currency in the game is fuel, and there's these oil barrels
582120	588680	that you'll find that you just run into them and you get more fuel to buy new cars.
588680	591880	But it's an awesome game, and it's going to be really fun online.
591880	596560	So if you're a fan of racing games, especially like Motorstorm, definitely going to be a
596560	597560	game for you.
597560	600040	Now, here's the burning question I have about this game, fuel.
600040	603240	Because they talk about, you know, that there's all this vast amount of land, that it's like
603240	605480	huge, you know, all this area that you can drive.
605480	610400	But is it interesting backdrop drop, or is it desert bus thrilling?
610400	611400	I mean...
611400	614000	No, it's very, there's a lot of variety in the terrain.
614000	615120	I mean, a lot of variety.
615120	618680	I mean, you'll get up on top of a mountain, you'll look, and you can see mountains way
618680	620560	in the distance, and you can actually drive there.
620560	621560	I mean...
621560	623320	So it's kind of like Oblivion, but for driving.
623320	627240	Because that's the feel I get from Oblivion, is like, Oblivion is effing huge.
627240	631520	You will never see everything in that game unless you are a sick, sad person.
631520	632520	You know what I mean?
632520	637200	This seriously, okay, I got tired from driving.
637200	643120	Like, it took me so long to get to the next destination, I got like driver's syndrome
643120	644120	or whatever, you know.
644120	645120	I felt tired.
645120	648360	In fact, that's actually when I turned the game off, because I'd been playing for a few
648360	649360	hours.
649360	651400	But it's actually really fun.
651400	655660	There's a lot of variety, there's a lot of events that you can do, or you can just drive
655660	656660	around.
656660	660000	You can make your own events and challenge people online with them.
660000	664920	You can, there's a bunch of different, you know, environments, day night cycles, different
664920	668240	weather effects that you have.
668240	669240	Lots of forests.
669240	673360	I mean, like, I was driving through forests, and then driving across farmland, and then
673360	674360	I got to the desert.
674360	677360	I mean, it literally, there's a ton of stuff.
677360	680640	And I mean, it has some stuff that, I guess it's supposed to be similar to the United
680640	681640	States.
681640	685880	Obviously the map's not set up like the United States, but it's got parts that like, okay,
685880	690440	maybe this is supposed to be Seattle, maybe this is like, you know, Nevada or something
690440	692140	like that.
692140	698420	But it's actually pretty sweet, so, um, you know, really gonna be holding my attention
698420	700460	for a while, at least as far as racing games go.
700460	702600	And it's an arcade style racer, so you'd probably like it.
702600	706680	I was gonna say, this, you know what, I was kind of feeling like, okay, I'm kind of looking
706680	708360	a little apprehensive about this game.
708360	711920	But now I'm hearing you describe it, I'm like, wow, I like want this game right now.
711920	712920	It's fun, yeah.
712920	714800	How does, what would you compare the controls to?
714800	717680	What's the closest game you can think of that this controls to?
717680	720680	Is it like F-Zero, or is it Forza?
720680	722680	You know, how, what are the controls?
722680	726660	Probably just like Motorstorm, I mean, there's no nitrous in it, but it's very simple.
726660	732360	It's like, you know, right trigger for accelerator, left trigger for brake, and then X for hand
732360	733360	brake.
733360	734360	That's it.
734360	735360	I'm, I'm very curious about this.
735360	736360	You, you definitely piqued my interest.
736360	740800	Um, actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrader.com says, it's made by Codemasters, and they make
740800	742400	pretty damn awesome driving games.
742400	745400	Yeah, like, Dirt was a really, that was Codemasters, right?
745400	746400	That was Codemasters, yeah.
746400	748720	That was a really interesting game to look at, but I couldn't control it for crap.
748720	753440	See, this is the other thing, it, the graphics in it aren't, like, they're good, but they're
753440	757600	not like, you know, the level of polish that you see in, like, Dirt 2's trailers and stuff
757600	758700	like that.
758700	762340	But I mean, it makes sense, because they have this huge landscape that they have to pop
762340	763340	you with everything.
763340	768880	And there's actually stuff around, you'll see, um, you know, I've ran over a dead, uh,
768880	774480	horse skeleton, I ran, um, there's, like, all these barns and farmland and stuff like
774480	778440	that, and you can, all of them have, like, ramps on them, so you can jump those.
778440	781440	Um, I don't know, there's, like, different events.
781440	785720	They have one that's, like, chase the copter, and you basically have to just try to navigate
785720	790280	your way to a helicopter, and, although I haven't seen it yet, there's tornadoes, so
790280	792720	you have to race through tornadoes.
792720	794760	That's awesome.
794760	797520	This could be, you know, I haven't heard a lot about this game, so maybe this is, like,
797520	798520	gonna be a sleeper hit.
798520	799520	I don't know.
799520	800520	It's been getting OK reviews.
800520	801520	I mean, it's fun.
801520	803600	Where are people critical of the game, and do you agree?
803600	806800	I haven't read the reviews yet, but I just saw the number of reviews, and they're, like,
806800	811160	getting mid eights, low, mid sevens, low eights, you know.
811160	812600	But I mean, it's just a number.
812600	816800	It's really, I've been looking forward to this game ever since they announced it, and
816800	817880	I think it's worth it.
817880	823160	It's gonna be very fun, and, you know, the fact that they have online, you can do online
823160	827120	free mode, so basically you're just driving with your friends.
827120	828840	Well, that was kind of test drive, wasn't it?
828840	829840	It was very similar to that.
829840	830840	Test drive sucked.
830840	831840	I mean...
831840	832840	I thought it was OK.
832840	833840	OK, test drive was awful.
833840	839920	I mean, like, the landscape was very plain, and the police couldn't chase after you off
839920	840920	the road.
840920	842200	It was just...
842200	843200	I don't know.
843200	846320	But, yeah, it's gonna be a good game.
846320	849960	Comes out next week.
849960	851960	Definitely worth picking it up.
851960	855680	Redertainment in our chat room asks, racing tornadoes, is Helen Hunt involved in this
855680	856680	game?
856680	857680	I don't know.
857680	858680	People have been looking for tornadoes.
858680	859800	I mean, they haven't...
859800	861240	I haven't found one yet.
861240	862240	I've just...
862240	865240	The only kind of weather that I've driven through, and maybe just because I'm only in
865240	870240	the one section of the map, although, I mean, the other sections of the maps are locked,
870240	871240	but not necessarily...
871240	875420	I mean, you can drive through them and stuff, but none of the events appear until you've
875420	879480	unlocked, you know, so many races and stuff, but, I mean, free mode, you can drive across
879480	883280	the whole thing, and I would be willing to bet it'd take a few hours to get from one
883280	884280	side of the map to the other.
884280	885280	I mean, it's huge.
885280	886280	Wow.
886280	888520	It's like walking in oblivion would take about that long, right?
888520	890680	Yeah, well, and then they do have helipads.
890680	893880	You can fly to different things, but, you know, for that achievement that I wanted to
893880	899640	get, it was drive from one without the use of helicopter, you know, it's like, wow, this
899640	900640	is long.
900640	901640	All right, all right.
901640	902640	Well, it sounds interesting.
902640	903640	I'll have to check that out.
903640	904640	When's this game released?
904640	905640	Probably on the 3rd, I believe.
905640	906640	Check it out.
906640	907640	That's Fuel.
907640	908640	Xbox 360 and PS3?
908640	909640	Yep.
909640	910640	All right.
910640	911640	My Gaming Week.
911640	912640	Okay.
912640	914760	My Gaming Week's been interesting.
914760	915760	There's really only been one...
915760	919080	I haven't had a lot of time to play games because I've been out of town this week, but
919080	923000	I decided to try something different this week, and, you know, if you were listening
923000	925680	to the show last week, you heard that I've been kind of disillusioned with a lot of stuff
925680	926920	that's been going on in Warcraft lately.
926920	931000	I think I've just kind of hit my saturation point with the game itself, like, I just need
931000	935080	a break at the expansion, even though they have the new dungeon, the old war and all
935080	936880	that stuff, I'm just not feeling it.
936880	939200	I needed a break from WoW.
939200	944960	So I got a great idea for something I could do, actually, as an article for Orangelaundrator.com,
944960	950100	and what I'm doing is an article about what I have missed in two and a half years in Final
950100	953360	Fantasy XI, and I reactivated my account this week on Final Fantasy XI.
953360	955360	Oh, my God.
955360	961040	I had to come right back in the room to hear Rob say something that I was dreading.
961040	967280	Now, something you should know, I have not told anybody this, not a single, no, one person
967280	972160	I told this because of another conversation we were having, one person knew until now,
972160	973160	now like what?
973160	975040	However many people are listening, no.
975040	979300	So it's kind of something I was keeping a little bit under wraps because it was something,
979300	983360	you know, I wanted to kind of see what I've been missing and what I could pick up on.
983360	987000	And I'll tell you what, damn, there is a lot that has changed.
987000	989720	It was really hard for me to kind of get back into it.
989720	993120	But I will say this, one thing I've noticed, and I'll write a full because I'm nowhere
993120	996680	near ready enough to write something full for the website yet, and believe me, there
996680	998720	will be a long article coming on the website later.
998720	1001480	I will notice this, one of the first things I noticed right away, they have made it way
1001480	1003280	easier to solo in that game.
1003280	1008480	Like there is so much more you can do in the first like 15 levels than you could before.
1008480	1010640	Is that worth it for me to go back and play?
1010640	1016200	I might, I am honestly gonna say, if you quit this game because grouping was too much for
1016200	1019040	you, there might be more in this game for you now.
1019040	1021480	That between these- Well that was the big thing is I hated being
1021480	1022480	the party bitch.
1022480	1025920	With the addition of the field manuals and this stuff where you can kind of get experience
1025920	1031500	for WoW style questing, and the fact that now Easy Prey monsters are a lot easier to
1031500	1036600	kill and give you like 60 experience, whereas before they would give you like 15, you know,
1036600	1039280	there seems to be a lot more you can do soloing.
1039280	1045520	Like I got from level 9 to level 12 in a couple hours of play, whereas before, like, man you'd
1045520	1050000	have to go to the dunes or you'd have to be soloing, it was a lot harder before.
1050000	1054880	So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.
1054880	1057080	I don't know how long I'm gonna stick with it, I don't know.
1057080	1061160	You know a big reason I stuck with WoW as long as I did is the people, and in Final
1061160	1065140	Fantasy XI right now, there is no people, I know one person that's playing, and I have
1065140	1068360	yet to run into them in the game, so I don't know.
1068360	1072680	I don't know how it's gonna go, but I wanted to really see, because part of the reason
1072680	1076840	I did this is because I have been so critical of Final Fantasy XI on the show and I've kind
1076840	1081440	of joked with listeners that I do feel I owe it to give the educated opinion if I'm gonna
1081440	1084680	knock on the game to see what I've missed in two and a half years, because every single
1084680	1089040	person I talk to that still plays the game says, Rob, it has changed.
1089040	1092760	Level syncing revolutionized the game, you need to go back.
1092760	1095600	So I went back, so we'll see what happens.
1095600	1099680	So I'm giving it a month, if I like it I'll stay, if I don't, I'll go back to WoW because
1099680	1101520	I'll probably miss it in about a month's time.
1101520	1105860	But honestly, with E3 this week and everything else, I don't expect to see the story on orangeonjurator.com
1105860	1110040	for about two weeks, because this next week I'm not gonna be in, so it won't be for like
1110040	1111040	two weeks.
1111040	1115240	In case of irony, I'm actually gonna go to Sony online, they're gonna give me a walkthrough
1115240	1120720	of all their MMOs, which is great because I don't have time to play any of them, so
1120720	1127720	you know, but man, I wanna check out APB when that's there, because that's gonna be there.
1127720	1130340	I hope Star Trek Online makes an appearance, we'll see.
1130340	1136140	To quote GS68 in the chatroom, it says, an e-drinking game rule, every time Sky talks
1136140	1139720	about MMOs, chug until he stops talking about them, and I told him not to do that because
1139720	1141720	of die of liver failure.
1141720	1144840	I know, it seems like all I ever talk about is MMOs, well I needed something, you know,
1144840	1150400	just Warcraft just kinda, you know, I needed a break, which is sad because I had a break,
1150400	1153400	not that long ago, but you know, it is what it is.
1153400	1158000	If games aren't fun, I don't play them, so I decided to try to have fun somewhere else,
1158000	1159000	so we'll see.
1159000	1162120	Anyhow, more to come on that in future weeks.
1162120	1163360	That was pretty much it for my gaming week.
1163360	1166920	I played some Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but it's all stuff I've talked about before.
1166920	1169000	I'm sure you all were gonna get a kick out of that one anyway.
1169000	1171600	Oh, and the show wasn't uploaded because his drive failed.
1171600	1175000	Yes, actually, which I was gonna get into on housekeeping, thank you.
1175000	1176480	Sorry, I thought you were doing housekeeping.
1176480	1182440	No, it had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XI keeping me from uploading the show or anything.
1182440	1185920	We have a storage drive, since we moved into Studio Dark Soccer, we have a storage drive
1185920	1191540	that, well wouldn't you know it, the storage drive failed this week and will not read anymore,
1191540	1193780	so everything we have on that drive is lost.
1193780	1198280	Now the good news is, everything is saved to this local computer in the studio anyway,
1198280	1202680	so it's not like we lost the files completely, but at least I hope, I didn't check, but I
1202680	1204040	don't think there would be a reason.
1204040	1206720	I'm pretty sure we always would copy them over.
1206720	1209480	So we should be caught up on the podcast sometime this week.
1209480	1213160	It's gonna be very tough with E3 and everything going on, but I want to get at least last
1213160	1217040	week's show up, like tomorrow before I leave, you know, and we'll slowly get caught up.
1217040	1220880	But that's the reason why the podcast feed is behind and we are really, really sorry,
1220880	1223640	but these things happen.
1223640	1224640	Technical difficulties.
1224640	1232560	I wasn't here last week because I was laying floor, which I just finished today.
1232560	1234200	It took forever.
1234200	1235200	But it looks nice.
1235200	1237880	Rama in chat says, Sky, it's not lost, I can tell you how to retrieve it.
1237880	1241080	Don't worry, we have a backup copy here on this computer, it's not gonna need anything
1241080	1245800	fancy or what have you, especially if somebody's been bootlegging the show now, which I heard
1245800	1249920	has been happening, just in case a future loss, we're fine.
1249920	1252160	We should have everything on this computer.
1252160	1254200	Stay tuned to our Twitter for more updates.
1254200	1259800	And by the way, if you're not on the Twitter for OLR, please get on there, twitter.com
1259800	1264080	slash OLR, because I'm telling you what, the Twitter users are going to be controlling
1264080	1265800	E3 for Orange Lounge Radio.
1265800	1269040	We are going to be tweeting from the show floor, what do you want us to look at?
1269040	1270480	What do you want pictures of?
1270480	1272160	What do you want us to ask?
1272160	1275440	What games are you not hearing enough about on the main sites, you know, because you know
1275440	1279760	everybody's gonna be talking about PSP Go and whatever Microsoft says, and if Nintendo
1279760	1282240	throws out a new Mario game, they're gonna be talking about that.
1282240	1284840	And that there's gonna be so many games that are overlooked.
1284840	1287880	That's what we're focusing on E3 this year, the stuff that everyone else overlooks.
1287880	1290600	We have to find the Korean porn games.
1290600	1293000	We will be looking for the Korean porn games, you betcha.
1293000	1294000	I hope they're there.
1294000	1298360	I hope the loss of Kensha Hall did not make us lose the porn games.
1298360	1299880	I love Kensha Hall.
1299880	1304440	I know, I'm very sad to see it's gone, but it looks like they have a lot of those developers
1304440	1305760	in West Hall on the side.
1305760	1310320	So we'll see, I'm thinking they just did some clever rearranging of things, and there are
1310320	1311920	a few people that aren't there this year.
1311920	1315000	You know, we don't have Atari this year, which by the way, Loki reminded me, there won't
1315000	1317600	be Star Trek Online, because Atari's not there.
1317600	1320600	But, you know, there's some other companies that aren't there, so we'll see what happens.
1320600	1323080	They're normally in the closet anyways over there.
1323080	1325200	Remember last time, you know.
1325200	1327960	Oh, Atari, you're only one of the big innovators of the...
1327960	1328960	Stupid douchebag.
1328960	1334320	Who was that douchebag with the, like, skateboard with carpet on it, with the PSP inside the
1334320	1335320	skateboard?
1335320	1336320	Nah.
1336320	1337320	Oh, yeah.
1337320	1338320	Oh, God.
1338320	1339320	I hate that guy.
1339320	1340320	Yeah, I remember that guy.
1340320	1341320	Anyway, I will be at the show Tuesday, Wednesday.
1341320	1342320	Loki will be at the show Wednesday, Thursday.
1342320	1344840	So between the two of us, we'll have the show covered all three days.
1344840	1348240	We're going, at least I think I am going to a party Wednesday night.
1348240	1351840	I'm hearing all these people talk about, oh, I got invited to seven parties and all that.
1351840	1356520	I think we're going to a party Wednesday night for Games for Windows, and thank you very
1356520	1358680	much for passing along the invite for that.
1358680	1360400	We're going to check it out, see what that's all about.
1360400	1361400	PC games.
1361400	1364900	I know that's something Dark Soccer is into, obviously, so I think for her, we need to
1364900	1368000	check out what Games for Windows is all about and see what they're going to be announcing
1368000	1369000	there.
1369000	1370000	Find out what doesn't suck.
1370000	1371000	Definitely.
1371000	1372000	All right.
1372000	1375720	So what does suck, we got so much news this week to get to, we're already 20 minutes into
1375720	1378560	the show and then some, let's get into the gaming news this week.
1378560	1380240	Loki, start us off.
1380240	1381240	Yes.
1381240	1388720	So the rumor is that, you know, the PlayStation Slim, or PlayStation 3's, Slimmer model, whatever
1388720	1392920	they're going to call it, is supposed to be coming out August or September, according
1392920	1395720	to the Ars Technica Mole.
1395720	1398200	Now, why should we believe this?
1398200	1402520	Well, because they were the one that talked about PSP Go, and, well, we'll be getting
1402520	1409000	into that later, but I think you all know that that was true, and there's actually box
1409000	1416040	shots that were leaked also of the PSP Go, which looked very similar to the PS3, so it
1416040	1417040	probably will be true.
1417040	1422120	I mean, you pretty much guessed that most of the stuff that's rumored and being hammered
1422120	1427920	in that it's going to happen is probably going to be true, and a lot of the stuff won't come
1427920	1428920	as a surprise.
1428920	1433360	What's interesting, though, there's a lot of people that say the PS3 Slim is still BS,
1433360	1436960	and I was listening to Bobby, who's on Right Before Us on All Games Radio, and he was talking
1436960	1442960	about how they don't, his hardware expert folks that help him do Friday night gaming,
1442960	1447840	don't think that it could fit, that there's so much that goes with Blu-ray that you can't
1447840	1452760	slim it down that much more, unless there, now my thought is maybe there's a technology
1452760	1457040	we're unaware of yet, I don't know, but, you know.
1457040	1459200	I think that it's going to happen.
1459200	1463880	I mean, we're going to find out about it tomorrow, or not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.
1463880	1466640	I don't think, well, I don't think we're actually going to find out about it tomorrow, I think
1466640	1471180	there's a good argument being made that they want to keep this thing under wraps, notice
1471180	1478440	how this got cease and desisted, whereas nothing else that's been leaked from Sony, including
1478440	1482360	things we're going to get into later and so on, that a lot of you probably heard about,
1482360	1486240	have been, or have not been cease and desisted, but Sony's kind of confirmed that.
1486240	1489960	The reason why, and, you know, because it's all going to be revealed Wednesday anyway,
1489960	1490960	it's all about hype, right?
1490960	1494240	Well, yes, but this hasn't been, this was probably going to be a big surprise or something,
1494240	1499080	but the other PSP Go stuff, that's already been released by Sony.
1499080	1504280	I mean, it's, you know, their online magazine or whatever that's releasing the information
1504280	1505280	about it.
1505280	1509320	If the PS3 comes out, if this PS3 slim comes out, or they come out Wednesday and say the
1509320	1514200	PlayStation 3 is going to be getting a slim model in a few months, sales of the PlayStation
1514200	1518720	3 will stop, because everybody is going, it will come to a standstill, because everybody's
1518720	1519960	going to be waiting for this new system.
1519960	1521080	No it won't, and you know why?
1521080	1525040	It's because the same reason why there's a new skew of the PlayStation 3 every time.
1525040	1529540	They don't stop sales, and if anything, what they'll do is a price drop on the current
1529540	1534000	system, they'll drop it down to clear out inventory, and then you'll have the new system
1534000	1538200	coming out at this, you know, normal price.
1538200	1540440	They've done the same pattern every time.
1540440	1545960	You know, it was $4.99, or before it was $5.99 and $4.99, and then they would drop the system
1545960	1551560	that was $5.99 down to $4.99 and clear it out, and then the new system would come out
1551560	1552560	at $5.99.
1552560	1557200	Well, now that they've dropped it to $100 again, it's $4.99 and $3.99, same type of
1557200	1558200	thing is going to happen.
1558200	1562360	These are going to drop down to maybe $50, and they're going to clear them out, or they
1562360	1566520	may even just keep offering it on the side and just have this one skew or whatever later
1566520	1568800	on towards the holidays.
1568800	1573040	But they're just going to, you know, drop the price of it a little bit until the, you
1573040	1576320	know, systems clear out, and then they're going to have the new one.
1576320	1578920	All right, well, we'll see.
1578920	1582480	I mean, there's a lot to be seen out of the press conference, and I think this is one
1582480	1585120	of the will they or won't they items.
1585120	1588520	But one interesting thing, I don't know if it's going to be covered tomorrow at the whole
1588520	1595800	press conference, but apparently Africa is finally getting some type of U.S. release.
1595800	1596800	That's right.
1596800	1600640	I mean, apparently Africa is finally going to be coming to the U.S., but they changed
1600640	1602000	the spelling back.
1602000	1604320	It's actually going to be Africa with a C now.
1604320	1607040	It's not going to be with a K. Apparently it was a big part of it.
1607040	1608040	Rob.
1608040	1609040	How can they do that to us?
1609040	1610040	It's not Africa.
1610040	1611040	It's Africa.
1611040	1612040	Oh, sorry.
1612040	1613040	Africa.
1613040	1616880	But apparently with less K and more C. I don't know.
1616880	1618120	Was it offensive or something?
1618120	1620020	I don't know why, but yeah.
1620020	1625480	They are deciding to change the name back to Africa with a C. But it is finally coming
1625480	1628560	out for the PlayStation 3, so if you were importing it, you don't really have to do
1628560	1629560	that anymore.
1629560	1630560	I want to hunt animals.
1630560	1631560	Can we hunt animals?
1631560	1632560	No.
1632560	1633560	Dang it.
1633560	1634560	Why, I am not buying as well.
1634560	1637980	Yeah, there's still that Jambo Safari remake we talked about last week to look forward
1637980	1638980	to much more.
1638980	1640320	You missed that, by the way, Loki.
1640320	1644560	The Jambo Safari announcement, I'm sure you read about it, but you know, we were very
1644560	1645840	excited about that last week.
1645840	1646840	That totally excites me.
1646840	1649880	Now if you want a game like Africa where you can run over the animals, you need to buy
1649880	1650880	Far Cry 2.
1650880	1654400	That's basically Africa with running over animals.
1654400	1656680	Although you have malaria, that's not fun either.
1656680	1659480	Real quick before we get to the next story, Tiger Claw says, that's a damn shame.
1659480	1663120	I kind of like the other title, Hakuna Matata.
1663120	1669880	It is kind of a cute title, but I bet Disney would glare if that happened here in the US.
1669880	1671360	That game actually came out with release.
1671360	1675880	I mean, it's not like they own the rights to that phrase, but you know, come on.
1675880	1680280	Whenever you hear Hakuna Matata, you can't help but think of Hakuna Matata.
1680280	1685680	Well now they're going to try to trademark the word up, so you know.
1685680	1690360	They've already got one of the directions, I mean, why not?
1690360	1693040	Hopefully they don't trademark Orange Launch Radio or we're going to be in trouble.
1693040	1694040	I don't know.
1694040	1695040	We'll see.
1695040	1698080	We need to hurry up and you know, actually get some sort of trade.
1698080	1699080	Patent pending.
1699080	1700080	Yeah, patent pending.
1700080	1704880	Actually, did you know, if you search the internet for, well obviously there's the band
1704880	1711840	act that we do take our namesake from in Japan, although that's a Japanese artist, not an
1711840	1714400	American artist.
1714400	1717400	There's some place, like some building or something.
1717400	1721720	There's actually like a music thing called the Orange Lounge where I guess they have
1721720	1724680	these musical acts come perform.
1724680	1726280	I think it's in Southern California too.
1726280	1728000	I think it's some type of gallery or whatever.
1728000	1730800	I found out when doing a search one night, you know, randomly just like, what else is
1730800	1731800	named Orange Lounge out there?
1731800	1732800	How big are we on the internet?
1732800	1737040	It's, well, it's interesting because you would think they would have really not liked the
1737040	1740960	fact that there's an Orange Lounge radio out there because we're both music oriented in
1740960	1741960	a way.
1741960	1742960	But here's the catch.
1742960	1744080	We've been around since 2001.
1744080	1745080	They haven't.
1745080	1748000	So if they did say anything, we'd be able to say, uh, we were first.
1748000	1749000	You change your name.
1749000	1750000	No, you.
1750000	1754000	But I mean, you know, it would be interesting to see what happens.
1754000	1755000	Anyhow, enough of that.
1755000	1757480	Let's move on with the gaming news.
1757480	1760760	Well, we have some very interesting stuff.
1760760	1767960	And actually it's a confirmation for something that, uh, Loki brought up is that Sony did
1767960	1774100	accidentally let stuff out on the PSP go, which, you know what, honestly, I think sometimes
1774100	1776680	this accidental stuff is half on purpose.
1776680	1777680	Accidental my ass.
1777680	1783160	They throw it out enough for it to catch on and then say, oh no, cease and desist, get
1783160	1784160	this crap off of here.
1784160	1786340	You know, just tease, tease, tease, tease, tease.
1786340	1793760	It's enough for the fanboys to get aroused by it, but not enough for the big sites, the
1793760	1798040	AP, CNN, and all these to report on it just yet.
1798040	1799480	It's bait.
1799480	1805440	It's exactly, it's bait because it's basically generating buzz for this now so that you want
1805440	1808920	to hear, you know, what's going to happen at the press conference and you all tuned
1808920	1811120	into that to find out their other announcements.
1811120	1812680	It's bait is what it is.
1812680	1813800	I'll tell us a little more about it.
1813800	1814800	Dark saga.
1814800	1825840	On Sony's core gaming show that they do, they posted the episode and then pulled it because
1825840	1827600	they had talked about the PSP go on there.
1827600	1832800	It has 16 gigabyte flash memory and Bluetooth support for mobile phone tethering.
1832800	1834640	That's pretty cool.
1834640	1842820	And also it mentioned Gran Turismo, LittleBigPlanet, Jak and Daxter, and Metal Gear Games.
1842820	1850280	So there actually are some photos of it out and about, and I'm trying to pull those up
1850280	1851280	right now.
1851280	1852280	Well, that's very interesting.
1852280	1855160	I didn't, I didn't catch the part about the mobile phone tethering, but isn't that interesting
1855160	1860080	because we've heard reports that the new Apple firmware is supposed to support the whole
1860080	1861080	tethering thing.
1861080	1864640	You're gonna have to pay more money, but I wonder, it's a very interesting time kind
1864640	1865640	of thing.
1865640	1867040	I think the Bluetooth is there for the mobile phone tethering.
1867040	1868440	Yeah, just looking at this.
1868440	1872400	I think it's just, I don't think your mic's on.
1872400	1876120	Just looking at this thing though, it really looks pretty cheap to me.
1876120	1878320	I mean, hey, look, you've got a little hook on there.
1878320	1883160	You can wear it, I guess, or some, something, or have a strap on it or something.
1883160	1887240	That's for the little, like, wrist strap thing that they have, so you don't throw it through
1887240	1889920	your TV.
1889920	1893440	Are they gonna make the, the, the go condom or something?
1893440	1894440	Perhaps.
1894440	1895440	Whatever.
1895440	1896440	Go condom.
1896440	1897440	That's funny.
1897440	1900920	But we should be seeing an 8 gigabyte and a 16 gigabyte version.
1900920	1908600	It of course has an analog nub, but not a full stick, because of course the screen slides
1908600	1909600	upwards.
1909600	1916240	You've got your D-pad, start select, and your four buttons.
1916240	1923480	You have a Wi-Fi indicator at the top left above the screen, and you have a PS button
1923480	1931440	and a Bluetooth light, and some shoulder buttons, of course, are on the top, so.
1931440	1934600	But I don't know, it looks kind of cheap to me.
1934600	1937200	Interesting comment from SonOfDad in chat, I like this observation.
1937200	1942040	If you notice John Collar say that with some games being announced at E3, they knew it
1942040	1943680	was gonna be leaked before E3.
1943680	1947440	So maybe the phrasing that they used in some of the interviews, they knew this was gonna
1947440	1949280	be leaked before E3 actually happened.
1949280	1950280	Oh, no doubt.
1950280	1951280	No doubt about it.
1951280	1953720	I mean, this is Sony.
1953720	1955240	And please excuse my voice tonight.
1955240	1958560	I don't know if I said earlier in the show, but I've like thrown out my voice this weekend
1958560	1960200	with some of the other stuff I had going on, so.
1960200	1961200	Rob's changed his throat now.
1961200	1962200	If I crack.
1962200	1963200	He's still got a 12 year old boy.
1963200	1965620	I know if I crack while reading some of your chat comments, it's not puberty, okay?
1965620	1967940	It's just I've really hurt my voice this week.
1967940	1970080	But here's what really happened.
1970080	1971480	What?
1971480	1972720	Nothing.
1972720	1978080	So I get it, you were making a joke, all right.
1978080	1979080	Anyhow.
1979080	1980080	Haha.
1980080	1981080	Loki, make yourself useful.
1981080	1982080	I'm giving you some gaming news.
1982080	1983080	All right.
1983080	1987560	So more information from the quote unquote leaked issue of CORE.
1987560	1991600	They also had some different games that were being announced in there as well, including
1991600	1993840	Gran Turismo PSP.
1993840	1995680	Right.
1995680	2000240	Gran Turismo PSP being announced for the, or being announced.
2000240	2002480	Was that supposed to have come out like years ago?
2002480	2005960	Yeah, I was like, wasn't Gran Turismo for the PSP announced like in 2005?
2005960	2006960	Exactly.
2006960	2010000	A new Jak and Daxter game for the PSP.
2010000	2011520	Oh, that's a surprise.
2011520	2016040	And also a new Metal Gear Solid game for the PSP.
2016040	2017040	Which is interesting.
2017040	2022440	They also had other clips, including footage from LittleBigPlanet, which that looks awesome.
2022440	2029240	And you know, some other stuff, possibility of Warhawk as well.
2029240	2030240	I don't know.
2030240	2035840	But I'm sure we're going to get a lot of PSP buzz coming from the press conference N8E3.
2035840	2039080	To shut up those people that says that they really haven't released anything on the PSP
2039080	2042040	in the past year, which would be somewhat true.
2042040	2043140	You know what I mean?
2043140	2047100	Like this is to derive, I mean, especially come out on Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP.
2047100	2048100	That's huge.
2048100	2050800	And it's not, you know, the portable ops.
2050800	2051800	It's not acid.
2051800	2052800	It's not port.
2052800	2053800	It's, it's fricking solid.
2053800	2056960	So, you know, I, and I, solid.
2056960	2057960	It's a solid game.
2057960	2061240	Here's now one thing that didn't make our show real tonight is about the Kojima countdowns
2061240	2063480	that have been going on because, you know, stories about countdowns are getting a little
2063480	2065400	old here on horizontal radio.
2065400	2069000	But I mean, if this is what it is building up towards, I think it's building up to
2069000	2070240	multiple things, actually.
2070240	2074360	I think that the countdown's building up to three different announcements.
2074360	2079240	One being a Raiden Metal Gear Solid game, which is probably going to be for the PS3.
2079240	2083680	The other being this probably Metal Gear Solid game based off of kind of the timeline of
2083680	2086940	Metal Gear Solid 3, you know, with Big Boss.
2086940	2092920	And also, I think, that game Mask, which looks like a survivor horror game that he was supposed
2092920	2095720	to be working on a survivor horror game, so.
2095720	2097560	Another survival horror from Konami?
2097560	2100160	I mean, that would be their third.
2100160	2101160	That's big.
2101160	2102960	Behind Silent Hill, Saw, and now this?
2102960	2103960	Really?
2103960	2104960	Yeah.
2104960	2105960	Interesting.
2105960	2110280	Well, it was supposed to be a zombie, like, you know, Left 4 Dead type of game, but still
2110280	2111280	survivor horror.
2111280	2114400	Oh, so, like, maybe more action-y than what we're used to.
2114400	2117880	I don't know, but it's a creepy picture that they have, so.
2117880	2119680	Uh, DarkTetsuya seems to agree with you.
2119680	2122440	It says in chat, you know, Loki's probably right.
2122440	2125720	You might want to be careful when you say things like that.
2125720	2128440	Don't let it get to his head.
2128440	2131080	Alright, I'm curious, chat room, what do you guys think?
2131080	2132720	Do you think Loki's right?
2132720	2136160	Do you think it means three different games could possibly be on their way?
2136160	2142760	Or this could be the E3 of nothing but Metal Gear, which would, you know, kind of make
2142760	2148760	sense a little bit, because we haven't heard a lot coming out of Konami's camp.
2148760	2149760	They've got some good stuff.
2149760	2153240	We'll have more later on, and I'm sure they're going to be showcasing the Saw game and some
2153240	2154240	of their music games.
2154240	2155240	Boo!
2155240	2156240	What else?
2156240	2160280	They've also got that, uh, there wasn't a lot that came out of their Gamers' Day.
2160280	2163440	There's that one that looked like Castlevania, but wasn't Castlevania, which I don't remember
2163440	2168120	the hell that game was called, but we were supposed to be talking about last week, and
2168120	2176480	then there was also, you know, their music games, Saw, Silent Hill, the new one that's
2176480	2178280	Shattered Memories or whatever that was.
2178280	2180960	Oh yeah, the Wii one.
2180960	2182240	Which actually looks really cool.
2182240	2187440	It's apparently different each time you play it, depending on how you answer their personality
2187440	2188440	profile thing.
2188440	2191520	It's like the eHarmony of Survivor Horror.
2191520	2192520	Hooray!
2192520	2195000	You better hurry up and trademark that!
2195000	2198680	I hope it doesn't reject me for being a fag, just like eHarmony would.
2198680	2203640	Don't just put a gay bar where the bar normally goes.
2203640	2210200	No, and then they have some other game, it's like Tornadoes.
2210200	2214320	It'll make all the zombies just want to dance.
2214320	2217320	That's horrible.
2217320	2223160	Prop 8 will attack you instead.
2223160	2225240	Prop 8 will kick me in the face.
2225240	2226240	That's what I'll get.
2226240	2228760	There's way too much gay going on in the show right now.
2228760	2232800	Anyway, so they've got stuff that haven't been announced yet.
2232800	2237920	Tornadoes Outbreak was the other game, which is coming out in September.
2237920	2243880	I don't know what the hell it is, but it's a game from Konami, and it has tornadoes in
2243880	2244880	it.
2244880	2245880	It's like tornadoes!
2245880	2249680	An outbreak of them.
2249680	2252960	Alright well guess what, Sony doesn't just make Playstations and PSPs.
2252960	2254800	Believe it or not, they're actually a pretty big company.
2254800	2259360	I'm not sure if you've heard of Sony before, but they do a lot outside of just the games.
2259360	2261640	One of the things they develop is mobile phones.
2261640	2262640	Sony what?
2262640	2265120	That's right, Sony develops a phone called the iKnow.
2265120	2266120	I think I'm saying that right.
2266120	2268840	A-I-N-O, the iKnow mobile phone.
2268840	2271760	Now this is like a new phone that they're doing.
2271760	2275820	It's not something that's out yet, and it's not to be confused with that PSP phone that's
2275820	2280320	been rumored about before, but apparently what this phone will do, you'll actually be
2280320	2284360	able to use remote play to access your PlayStation 3.
2284360	2288680	And here's the thing, the device has 3G on it, so here's the deal.
2288680	2294480	When you get on this, you can use the 3G to like stream movies, images, music from your
2294480	2297200	PlayStation 3 hard drive.
2297200	2298200	Isn't that kind of neat?
2298200	2301960	Yeah, so if you have porn saved on your drive, you could have that anywhere streaming over
2301960	2302960	3G.
2302960	2304880	What a waste of our bandwidth.
2304880	2305880	Porn anywhere?
2305880	2307200	Wow, that sounds like the internet.
2307200	2310960	Oh wait, it is the internet.
2310960	2314680	Well here's the other deal, in Europe you can get Play TV.
2314680	2320240	You'll be able to view, rewind, pause, whatever live television, and you can also record it
2320240	2322920	while you're on the go, the way the mobile phone is.
2322920	2325280	That's technology we've never seen before.
2325280	2329600	So if you forget like, oh crap, I was supposed to record Grey's Anatomy or whatever, you
2329600	2331680	can set it from your phone I guess.
2331680	2338480	Keep in mind though, for the most part, cell phones in Japan have been just decades ahead
2338480	2343880	of what we've had here for the longest time until we started trickling out with Trios
2343880	2348200	and Blackberries and finally the iPhone.
2348200	2351080	Now we have all these apps for iPhones that will do all this crap for us.
2351080	2356840	But still, I mean, this is probably really nothing major.
2356840	2358320	This is expected probably.
2358320	2362800	Yeah, I don't think the Sony I know has a shaking baby application.
2362800	2363800	That's something that's missing.
2363800	2365120	The iPhone doesn't have it anymore.
2365120	2366120	Not anymore.
2366120	2368520	They don't have the cocaine application anymore either.
2368520	2369520	There was a cocaine application?
2369520	2372320	You could sort the thing and then...
2372320	2373320	It's a hell of a drug.
2373320	2376760	We actually talked about it in my typography class.
2376760	2377760	Wow.
2377760	2379840	How is that relevant to typography?
2379840	2382640	Do you make letters out of the coke?
2382640	2384480	I know a lot of...
2384480	2385960	Were some of the best fonts designed?
2385960	2386960	Never mind.
2386960	2392960	A lot of some of the best fonts were designed by a lot of people who were on lots of stuff.
2392960	2393960	Alright.
2393960	2394960	Let's see.
2394960	2400760	Rama says, so grab your dick and double click for porn, porn, porn.
2400760	2402720	Game Guru says, why would I TiVo Grey's Anatomy?
2402720	2403720	I don't know.
2403720	2404720	Obviously someone is.
2404720	2405720	The show's still on.
2405720	2406720	Exactly.
2406720	2407720	You have to watch it live.
2407720	2411560	Misty says, no, the internet is for OLR, which is the gateway to porn.
2411560	2413560	Get it right, Game Guru.
2413560	2415040	Oh, sorry.
2415040	2418120	Dark Shy says, 3G coverage isn't exactly everywhere, is it?
2418120	2420480	I saw a map of 3G coverage for the newest iPhone.
2420480	2425320	I don't think it's everywhere, but for the big city people, I don't know where you live,
2425320	2430400	but I can tell you living here in Sacramento and the places I go the most are San Francisco,
2430400	2432280	LA, the places I drive.
2432280	2437680	I don't ever lose 3G unless I'm in the basement of a building or behind solid wood.
2437680	2439960	Walls where the signal can't reach and I'll go on edge.
2439960	2441280	Like I get 3G everywhere.
2441280	2447080	Well, I, and to be perfectly honest, you don't even need 3G really to get good signal in
2447080	2448080	a major city.
2448080	2449080	Yeah.
2449080	2451340	So I've never wanted it.
2451340	2454780	I mean the, I know I've heard a lot of complaints about AT&T and their coverage, but it's been
2454780	2455780	fine for me.
2455780	2456960	Very, very rare.
2456960	2458800	Do I not have 3G?
2458800	2459800	So I don't know.
2459800	2460800	Maybe I'm just lucky.
2460800	2461800	Now we have 4G.
2461800	2463300	Yeah, I know.
2463300	2464300	Fricking Apple.
2464300	2465300	Yay.
2465300	2468680	Do you hear this rumor about the, the dormant video thing that's been in everybody's phone
2468680	2471040	the whole time that they're finally going to turn on with iPhone 3.0?
2471040	2472040	Boy.
2472040	2473040	Oh boy.
2473040	2476280	You mean the thing that there's been a homebrew apps that have already been doing it?
2476280	2477280	Yeah.
2477280	2478280	That.
2478280	2480900	So, I mean just a huge selling point they could have with the iPhone this whole time
2480900	2483280	that they just, just, just because they can do that.
2483280	2485160	But then again, Nintendo does the same shit.
2485160	2492040	So there's also, um, uh, apps for, um, video play for not video, but for a sound recording.
2492040	2493040	Yeah.
2493040	2495760	That, that, you know, I've, I've had mine forever.
2495760	2497320	I haven't used it, but I have it.
2497320	2500360	Alright, well let's move on with some more, uh, gaming news, Dark Sakura.
2500360	2504920	Well, something that I have been particularly looking forward to, and I'm glad finally has
2504920	2508360	somewhat of a date, is, um, Star Trek Online.
2508360	2511400	Because I want my own ship, dammit.
2511400	2514480	Um, and according to- And I would like to throw tribbles at Dark
2514480	2515480	Sakura.
2515480	2518040	As long as you don't feed them.
2518040	2521080	Remember if you feed them, then they breed.
2521080	2524440	I have, by the way, had the most tribble-tastic week, because I think I've watched trials
2524440	2527440	and tribulations, like, four times this last week.
2527440	2528440	Nerd.
2528440	2530800	And trouble with tribbles once.
2530800	2534920	And then we tried to watch the animated episode, and then the people watching it with me complained
2534920	2536160	about the bad animation quality.
2536160	2539120	I swear I didn't mean to derail your story.
2539120	2542400	Um, anyway.
2542400	2547160	According to one of, um, Atari's financial documents, it says that they expect Star Trek
2547160	2552360	Online to be out no later than March 31st, 2010.
2552360	2558240	And it will be, um, both console and PC, according to the document.
2558240	2566160	Um, nothing official from Cryptic yet, um, but I'm sure that we should see something
2566160	2567160	soon.
2567160	2568160	All right.
2568160	2569160	Hopefully.
2569160	2570800	I want to play!
2570800	2572080	I know.
2572080	2574600	Talk about the game that'll make me leave any MMO I'm playing.
2574600	2579520	Wherever, wherever my fickle ass is at the moment, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI,
2579520	2583920	Hal-Ragnarok, I don't know, maybe I'll get into EVE before this is all over.
2583920	2586080	I'm going to Star Trek Online the minute this comes out.
2586080	2587560	I need to make the O.L.O.R.I.E.N.s.
2587560	2588560	Yes.
2588560	2593400	I will be putting official data out for what these specs are to make an O.L.O.R.I.E.N.
2593400	2597760	And I want nothing but, I want to captain my own ship of nothing but red-shirt people.
2597760	2600520	You can't, because you have to, you have to have command people.
2600520	2601520	Damn it!
2601520	2602960	You have to have doctors.
2602960	2603960	All right.
2603960	2605440	Every MMO talk is bad now.
2605440	2607440	Just wait until this game comes out.
2607440	2609160	Wait to see how nerdy we all get.
2609160	2614160	Again, and I say this every time, and I'm going to say it every time, every week, every
2614160	2617240	time this game gets brought up, I'm going to say this.
2617240	2620100	This game better not suck.
2620100	2623160	Star Trek has so much momentum going for it right now.
2623160	2624160	Please.
2624160	2626120	There will be riots in the streets.
2626120	2627120	It will be me.
2627120	2628120	It'll just be Rob.
2628120	2629120	It will be me.
2629120	2631120	He'll be out there going, riot!
2631120	2635720	I made a dark sakura, I will like throw a Slurpee against a window of a 7-11.
2635720	2638200	That'll be my riot, okay?
2638200	2642320	I will be pissed if this game sucks, and we'll put it on YouTube or something.
2642320	2646120	You know, as the classic line from the movie goes, better to be pissed off than pissed
2646120	2647120	on.
2647120	2651440	Rama says, Sky will request a pink starship with sparkles.
2651440	2652440	No.
2652440	2653440	No.
2653440	2656520	You, wait, you're freaking like stereotyping or something?
2656520	2658520	No, I do not want a pink starship with sparkles.
2658520	2662080	I want a purple starship with sparkles, ass.
2662080	2664520	And Stickaxe asks, what if the game sucks, Rob?
2664520	2666520	Well, you heard me, riot.
2666520	2669440	Then we take to the streets.
2669440	2672560	Then we protest in front of Atari.
2672560	2675040	It'll be a- We get all the people at Cryptic and we-
2675040	2676740	It'll be a dual protest.
2676740	2680900	One side of the sign will say, overturn Prop 8, and the other side will say, remake Star
2680900	2683560	Trek because this version sucks.
2683560	2688120	And then we subject the people at Cryptic that are in charge of that to-
2688120	2691760	Um, investigation by special means.
2691760	2692760	Alright.
2692760	2695200	By, um, probing.
2695200	2696560	That's right.
2696560	2697560	There you go.
2697560	2698560	There's the answer.
2698560	2700560	If this game sucks, anal probes.
2700560	2701560	Exactly.
2701560	2702560	Alright.
2702560	2707640	And I'll tell you what, just for that, I'm putting a model of the Enterprise in my home.
2707640	2713000	Let's probe around the world right now and look at the upcoming release dates for upcoming
2713000	2714000	games.
2714000	2715000	Yes.
2715000	2720360	We've got a few things coming up this week, um, including Fuel, which is gonna be awesome.
2720360	2725880	That's on, uh, PS3 and Xbox 360, I think also the PC, but I don't see that.
2725880	2729160	Hey, last thing, I'm sorry, every time you say that, the Metallica song pops into my
2729160	2730160	head?
2730160	2731160	Yes.
2731160	2733640	Give me fuel, give me fire, give me that, what's hard to say?
2733640	2735800	That's the only thing that's disappointing about that game.
2735800	2740240	The music kinda sucks, cause it's not really any licensed music except for the theme song,
2740240	2744720	which is by Uncle, which is pretty cool, and actually one of my previous cage match picks
2744720	2750680	um, but yeah, all the rest of the music in the game is just kind of like, eh.
2750680	2753280	But they do support custom soundtracks, so that's always good.
2753280	2755840	I like how you said that, it's kinda eh.
2755840	2757960	Um, okay, but other things coming out.
2757960	2761640	Age of Pirates 2, City of Abandoned, on PC.
2761640	2764200	Arrrrr, it's abandoned.
2764200	2769480	Uh, Chicken, er, Crazy Chicken Atlantis Quest on DS.
2769480	2772760	Fuck these games, weren't there like three of them last week?
2772760	2775480	Crazy Chicken Star Carts on DS.
2775480	2779240	These are probably the same games from last week, they just never came out.
2779240	2780240	Um.
2780240	2781240	Gee, I wonder why.
2781240	2784000	Crazy Chicken Pharaoh's Treasure on DS.
2784000	2789040	Yes, Mumbo Jumbo doesn't know anything about hitting dates as far as releases go.
2789040	2795120	Um, Red Faction Guerrilla coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3, that game looks awesome.
2795120	2799000	The main feature, I guess, was explosions, and you know, can't go wrong there.
2799000	2800000	I like explosions.
2800000	2801000	And it's on Mars.
2801000	2805240	Crazy Chicken is actually, if any of these Crazy Chicken games are actually good games,
2805240	2808120	I will eat, like a cup of mayonnaise.
2808120	2812160	And anyone who knows me, knows that that is like my own personal hell right there.
2812160	2815880	If these games are actually any good, I will down an entire cup of mayonnaise, live on
2815880	2816880	air.
2816880	2820120	No, you have to understand, this is a character that's popular, apparently popular, in, um,
2820120	2821120	the UK.
2821120	2824840	And so they, they get the licensing rights really cheap, and they bring them over here.
2824840	2828600	It's just like Moomin, which, you know, this company Graffiti is bringing over.
2828600	2829600	I don't even know what the hell that is.
2829600	2833640	It's even better that, you know, I, no disrespect to whatever they like over there in the UK,
2833640	2836880	but then you're basically just telling me, oh, on top of already thinking these games
2836880	2840040	are gonna suck, you're telling me they're licensed games, and how, you know, off of
2840040	2843600	TV and movie properties, how often are those games any good?
2843600	2845600	They're not.
2845600	2851120	Um, Knights of the Nightmare on DS, coming from Atlus.
2851120	2854840	And then, of course, you know, one of the bigger titles of the week, Sims 3, coming
2854840	2859800	out on PC, also available in a collector's edition, where you get a bunch of useless
2859800	2860800	crap.
2860800	2866400	Um, and then the game with the longest title of the week, and I don't know why, but Johnny
2866400	2869720	Bravo and the hunk-a-mega-mighty ultra-extreme Datorama.
2869720	2874200	Yes, the title may be long, but the game still sucks.
2874200	2875560	Wow.
2875560	2879760	And, um, then, of course, we've got some other fun stuff.
2879760	2886280	More party games from Majesco, go play lumberjacks, lumberjack-themed games, and go play Circus
2886280	2891320	Star, where you can play as a, you know, circus performer.
2891320	2893600	Is it a lumberjack and it's okay?
2893600	2894600	Maybe.
2894600	2900680	And then Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad, coming to the DS from Destineer.
2900680	2906760	And finally, a week from today, the legendary Starfy, a game that apparently is a franchise
2906760	2908000	in Japan.
2908000	2912360	I don't know anything about it and it looks stupid, but, you know, that's just my dumb
2912360	2915160	American opinion.
2915160	2916160	Questions from chat.
2916160	2917160	Marissa is in chat.
2917160	2918160	Hi, Marissa.
2918160	2921740	Marissa Gungusto asks, no Rob, not Mayo, don't do it.
2921740	2925540	You know what, I'm that confident that I'm right, so I'm not even worried about it.
2925540	2929320	It's just like Loki doing the bet on Eye of Judgment, the legendary bet that people still
2929320	2931480	haven't shut up about two years later.
2931480	2935280	He was that confident in it, and you know what, he was right.
2935280	2938600	Stickaxe asks, how would we determine whether they're any good, Rob?
2938600	2941160	Would it be that the games have a Metacritic score above a certain amount?
2941160	2943920	I suppose, but honestly, you've been listening to this show long enough.
2943920	2944920	You can trust me.
2944920	2947960	If the games are good, I will tell you, and we will do it.
2947960	2952440	And if you don't believe me, you think I'm lying, we can get like a, we can agree upon
2952440	2954880	a non-discriminatory panel or something.
2954880	2955880	I don't know.
2955880	2958280	But I'm that confident these games are no good.
2958280	2959400	Come on.
2959400	2961760	Games like this are a dime a dozen.
2961760	2964280	Do you really think there's a chance in hell I'm eating the mayonnaise?
2964280	2967480	Hell no, otherwise I wouldn't have said it.
2967480	2969040	Are you looking it up on Metacritic right now?
2969040	2976080	Okay, this has got to go then on the official, you know, the official stuff, you know, ongoing
2976080	2978280	bets on the show.
2978280	2981360	You know, I think this game is so awesome, it's not even on there.
2981360	2984480	Oh wait, here we go, here's the last one that came out on DS.
2984480	2989720	Chicken Hunter, which is also the same franchise, they just changed the name, got a Metacritic
2989720	2992640	rating of three, or thirty-nine.
2992640	2994360	It's quality right there.
2994360	2995360	There you go, exactly.
2995360	2996360	I have nothing to worry about.
2996360	2998760	You could probably go off Metacritic and I'd be just fine.
2998760	3002960	Hey, let's talk about something interesting, and that is the Japanese release dates, although
3002960	3007000	I do like Marissa's idea of making it bacon-aise, to make it a little easier on me.
3007000	3008560	Dude, bacon-aise is great.
3008560	3013240	So if I do, I do want to put that clause in the contract, just in case.
3013240	3017160	The cup of mayonnaise do be bacon-aise, and I think everybody would agree, just for my
3017160	3021960	own sanity and well-being, that would be the way to do it, thank you.
3021960	3024800	I will end up in the hospital again with pancreatitis if I lose this bet.
3024800	3025800	Just wait.
3025800	3026800	Uh, anyway.
3026800	3028960	That's why we'll get you some fat-free mayonnaise.
3028960	3031440	Yeah, fat-free bacon-aise, good luck.
3031440	3033200	They're gonna have to like, invent it.
3033200	3040320	Alright, on the Xbox 360, I'm gonna have to fucking eat Miracle Whip.
3040320	3044040	Eww, gross.
3044040	3049080	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, nothing.
3049080	3052240	It is completely empty until June 25th.
3052240	3055320	There is like, nothing on the calendar right now for the Xbox 360.
3055320	3057560	It's pretty boring right now over in Japan.
3057560	3061080	Just not a busy time of year for them, and PlayStation 3 really doesn't look much different,
3061080	3062080	I have to be honest.
3062080	3063880	It's a very slow week over there.
3063880	3069320	Um, moving on, however, to the Nintendo Wii, at least you get Ark Rise Fantasia comes out
3069320	3070920	in Japan from Marvelous.
3070920	3072200	That comes out on the Wii this week.
3072200	3075000	That's really the only release to look forward to there.
3075000	3079200	And taking a look at the PlayStation 2, Evangelion Joe comes out there.
3079200	3080200	What?
3080200	3081200	More Eva games?
3081200	3082200	Of course, of course.
3082200	3085320	There's just no other, uh, no other way to do it over there.
3085320	3087480	And on the Nintendo DS, you have a few more options.
3087480	3094040	You have Kotowari Sahai Simulation Ochanomapro Yaku D.S. is the name of that game.
3094040	3095720	I'm not sure what exactly you're simulating.
3095720	3098600	Oh, it looks like baseball, looks like a baseball coach game.
3098600	3100660	This is, yeah.
3100660	3101660	So there you go.
3101660	3102660	That's baseball.
3102660	3106040	Very quick on the PSP to see if there's anything of interest there, although I highly doubt
3106040	3107040	it.
3107040	3109200	Oh, you get a port of that same Evangelion game on the PSP.
3109200	3110200	And that's really it.
3110200	3111200	Kids like Eva.
3111200	3112200	That's right.
3112200	3113200	That's really it for Japanese releases.
3113200	3115000	It's kind of a slow, uh, week for them.
3115000	3119040	Well, how about we go overseas, um, in another direction?
3119040	3123200	Here's, um, stuff that, uh, is coming out in, um, UK.
3123200	3129160	We have, on the 5th, actually, a bunch of releases, um, at least a handful, anyway.
3129160	3137080	We play Control Donkey Kong Jungle Beat on Wii, Red Faction Gorilla on Xbox 360 and PS3,
3137080	3144740	Sacred 2 Fallen Angel on Xbox 360 and PS3, Star Ocean The Last Hope on Xbox 360, Walk
3144740	3147760	With Me Do You Know Your Walking Routine on DS.
3147760	3150840	No, I forgot how to walk.
3150840	3151840	It's your walking routine.
3151840	3152840	Left, right, left, right, left, right.
3152840	3153840	Routine.
3153840	3157240	So do I get to make a walking, like, dance routine or something?
3157240	3159680	It's scheduling your walks, I guess.
3159680	3160680	I guess.
3160680	3163960	And then Sims 3, of course, which, yay!
3163960	3164960	Happy.
3164960	3166000	That's it.
3166000	3168240	I don't remember you being so Sims fangirly.
3168240	3172360	It's like it came out of the woodworks, or we awakened a sleeping beast within or something.
3172360	3176360	I'm not sure where the- Well, it basically took at least, you know,
3176360	3180920	four people I know starting to play and playing again, but I was like, uh, me as well.
3180920	3183360	And then I was like, I really just like building houses.
3183360	3184360	That's really it.
3184360	3186640	I don't care about playing the game.
3186640	3192160	I don't care about how many babies my Sims have, or, you know, who gets bitten by a vampire
3192160	3193400	and who kills zombies.
3193400	3195560	I care about building the houses.
3195560	3199200	You sound kind of similar to Loki in how he, a lot of these games he plays, he doesn't
3199200	3200200	really care about the game.
3200200	3202520	He just cares about how he can hack it to his liking.
3202520	3205720	I'm, like, look at my house.
3205720	3207600	I am building a freaking gorgeous house.
3207600	3208600	It's very red, so far.
3208600	3210160	Well, that's just a wall.
3210160	3211680	Well, the walls are red.
3211680	3212680	Let's see.
3212680	3213680	All right.
3213680	3214680	You've built this live on air.
3214680	3215680	You started from scratch at the beginning of the night, right?
3215680	3217680	I started on, I actually started it last night.
3217680	3219680	Oh, I thought you did the whole thing on air tonight.
3219680	3220680	Here's my entire house.
3220680	3221680	There's, see, there's my potty.
3221680	3222680	Oh.
3222680	3223680	And there's the upstairs.
3223680	3224680	All right.
3224680	3225680	Anyhow.
3225680	3226680	This is horrible radio.
3226680	3227680	They can't see it.
3227680	3228680	I'll put pictures up eventually.
3228680	3229680	All right.
3229680	3230680	Uh, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3230680	3233080	We will get into the classic game of the week and our break tonight pretty soon.
3233080	3236440	We still have about 10 more stories to go over, so, uh, Loki, we've got to get to it.
3236440	3237440	Sorry.
3237440	3239000	I'm looking at a picture.
3239000	3240000	That's funny.
3240000	3244820	Um, DJ Hero, a game that we've been talking about for quite a while now, lots of stuff
3244820	3250420	coming out this week, especially, um, game trailers ran an exclusive, um, E3 trailer
3250420	3256280	that they put out showing some of the gameplay, um, which is not surprising, you know, it
3256280	3259980	looks very much how they described it in the magazine, but we've got some more details
3259980	3260980	now.
3260980	3265720	They're going to have a few different versus modes, including DJ versus DJ, uh, DJ plus
3265720	3270980	DJ, you know, like a co-op or DJ plus guitar, um, you know, for the 10 tracks that they
3270980	3276640	have, um, you know, guitar support for, and, um, of course, you know, the game's going
3276640	3279840	to be coming out on all platforms, rumored to be $120.
3279840	3287520	Yeah, that's kind of expensive, and, um, also they're going to be having a limited edition,
3287520	3292840	um, pack coming out that's going to be, uh, tying in with Jay-Z and Eminem.
3292840	3299120	Apparently this is going to come with an advanced version of the controller, a DJ stand, a metal
3299120	3306960	traveling case, and also, um, the greatest hit CDs from both rappers, and sadly enough
3306960	3308820	I want to get that.
3308820	3314240	Not because I'm fans of them, but because I like the idea of, you know, a DJ stand and
3314240	3317500	a metal traveling case, so it would be all sorts of nerdy cool.
3317500	3320160	This is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3.
3320160	3325480	I want to see how they're pulling this off, because I love the concept, everything I'm
3325480	3328000	seeing, you know, I was a little nervous when I first heard they were making this game,
3328000	3332200	but everything I'm hearing, I love the idea of the songs all being mashups, everything
3332200	3334480	sounds good, but it's all in the execution.
3334480	3337480	This is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3.
3337480	3339940	Yep, same here.
3339940	3344360	Did you see the video though this week where they did, uh, it was, um, Rick James, Give
3344360	3348840	It To Me Baby, and then also, um, Hollaback Girl mixed together?
3348840	3350240	No, I hadn't seen that.
3350240	3351360	Oh, you gotta see that.
3351360	3353120	Oh my god, they have video of gameplay now?
3353120	3354120	Yeah.
3354120	3355120	No, I totally missed that.
3355120	3356120	Yeah.
3356120	3357120	Oh my gosh, I gotta see that.
3357120	3361800	So, um, they have an interview, uh, video that shows some gameplay, and then they also
3361800	3366280	have the actual official trailer that has that song in there, but it's interesting.
3366280	3369480	Well, our chat room is lighting up right now with comparisons, of course, whenever it seems
3369480	3373320	like the DJ games get brought up, 2DX gets brought up, um, interesting enough, the next
3373320	3377780	story I have has to do with Bamani and, uh, what could possibly be next in the US.
3377780	3381560	It's about another music series, not Beatmania, but Poppin' Music.
3381560	3386840	Now, you might remember, we all declared Poppin' Music dead in the US, uh, when Beat and Groovy
3386840	3387840	crashed and burned.
3387840	3389200	Remember that one on Xbox Live Marketplace?
3389200	3390200	Oh my god.
3390200	3391760	Damn it, Rob, I've been trying to forget about that.
3391760	3392760	It was terrible.
3392760	3396080	It was basically an American translation of Poppin' Music, but to call it that would be
3396080	3399160	like, I don't even know how to begin to describe it.
3399160	3402240	It was, it was a terrible, terrible, uh, port of Poppin' Music.
3402240	3404760	It should have been cancelled by Konami before it ever came out.
3404760	3407560	Uh, but what's interesting though, we might have been wrong.
3407560	3410160	Poppin' Music may not be dead in the US.
3410160	3415600	Apparently, there has been a trademark filed that indicates that Poppin' Music is coming
3415600	3418760	to North America, and of course, if you've never played Poppin' Music before, it's like
3418760	3422680	these nine giant, like, imagine the Poppa-matic bubbles from Trouble.
3422680	3425440	Imagine there's nine of them all laid out in kind of a keyboard-y format.
3425440	3428840	Uh, that's what the machine looks like, and it plays very similar to these beat-matching
3428840	3429840	games.
3429840	3433320	Um, but now this trademark was filed, and everybody thought, okay, well, maybe they
3433320	3434720	are gonna bring it to the US.
3434720	3440000	Well, apparently, a little more was released when Konami actually dropped the Poppin' Music
3440000	3441120	Wii page.
3441120	3445040	That's right, Poppin' Music appears to be headed towards the Wii, but what's most interesting
3445040	3450360	about it, the screenshots do not look 100% like the Poppin' Music we know and love right
3450360	3451360	now.
3451360	3453160	It looks like, uh, the game could be a little bit different.
3453160	3456760	Uh, apparently, there might be some online support as well.
3456760	3458880	Maybe that could be download songs, who knows?
3458880	3463140	But apparently, even box art has gone up for Japan, and, uh, it does look like it's gonna
3463140	3465200	bring over a lot of the Japanese characters.
3465200	3469480	It'll be very interesting to see if this is, uh, debuted at E3, because apparently, the
3469480	3473360	Wii remote and nunchucks do come into play, which is weird, because they weren't a part
3473360	3474680	of the original game.
3474680	3479120	But maybe they're trying to translate this somehow for play with the Wiimotes, and not
3479120	3482600	the 9 configuration without having to release a new controller.
3482600	3483600	No idea.
3483600	3484600	This could be very interesting.
3484600	3487860	They're not gonna put in, like, like, freestyle mode or anything, are they?
3487860	3488860	No idea.
3488860	3492560	Some people are saying maybe it's like a Poppin' Music adventure kind of game, I, I don't,
3492560	3494560	which is, I guess, a spin-off series that happened in Japan.
3494560	3497640	I'm not as familiar with it, despite all the Bomani I do know about.
3497640	3501520	I'm not as familiar with the adventure series, but, uh, apparently, the game is coming out
3501520	3502520	August 6th.
3502520	3505400	So, if there is an American version of this coming out, which the trademark would lead
3505400	3507440	you to believe, we might see it at E3.
3507440	3511080	That would be very interesting.
3511080	3512080	That's just bizarre.
3512080	3513080	Yeah.
3513080	3514080	Very bizarre.
3514080	3515080	Who knows?
3515080	3516080	More to come on this, uh, probably this next week.
3516080	3517080	We'll see.
3517080	3521820	Well, I do have sad news for the five people still playing Matrix online.
3521820	3522820	All five of you.
3522820	3524440	I'm counting you.
3524440	3527760	Well, you're SOL now.
3527760	3532400	It's, uh, actually, you know what?
3532400	3533400	I picked the wrong thing.
3533400	3534400	Oh, that's...
3534400	3535400	No, no, yeah, I did.
3535400	3536400	Sorry.
3536400	3539400	I did pick the right thing.
3539400	3540400	Oops!
3540400	3541400	Live radio!
3541400	3543400	These things happen sometimes.
3543400	3546400	Why don't you start it from the top?
3546400	3553880	Well, um, for the five people who are still playing this, um, sorry, guys, Sony hates
3553880	3555120	you.
3555120	3556920	They really do hate you.
3556920	3562280	Um, actually, uh, Sony of Europe is pulling, um, Matrix online.
3562280	3563640	It is being shut down.
3563640	3569680	You, I'm sorry, Sony, I want to say Sony of Europe, uh, Sony Online Entertainment, sorry,
3569680	3572000	will be, um, closing it down on July 31st.
3572000	3576720	You better get in your, your Matrixing while you can, and then prepare to swallow your
3576720	3579040	blue pill.
3579040	3580560	Before somebody unplugs you.
3580560	3581560	You're done.
3581560	3582560	No more.
3582560	3584760	Wait for private servers to pop up.
3584760	3585760	I'm not surprised.
3585760	3586760	Neither am I.
3586760	3587760	Me neither.
3587760	3588760	I really didn't realize.
3588760	3589880	I actually thought it ended a long time ago.
3589880	3590880	Exactly.
3590880	3592680	Was that the end of the world event or something in there?
3592680	3593680	Like a long time?
3593680	3594680	That was the beta.
3594680	3597000	Oh, I thought the damn thing was done a long time ago.
3597000	3599600	I thought so, too, but I think that was just the beta.
3599600	3600600	Yeah.
3600600	3608120	Actually, um, it was, uh, the, Ben Chamberlain, who was the designer in GM, um, was the one
3608120	3612480	doing all the content updates, the one keeping everything alive, and then he left.
3612480	3617840	So, um, basically, they're gonna be doing, though, some sort of monumental end of the
3617840	3619480	world thing, and then that's it.
3619480	3621760	They'll do the exact same thing they did for the beta.
3621760	3625480	I'm, I'm kinda curious here, Gold Anthro is in chat, and apparently, as somewhat of a
3625480	3628880	fan of The Matrix Online, says, I was following the story of that.
3628880	3632800	They could at least finish the story properly, maybe make a second Animatrix collection based
3632800	3634000	on the events of the MMO.
3634000	3637000	Um, but, Jamie, a lot of fun of that game is the story.
3637000	3639000	That's why I followed it and tried the free trial.
3639000	3641680	So, another opinion from chat.orangelandraday.com.
3641680	3645880	I mean, for hardcore fans of The Matrix, to be fair, as much as we're teasing the game,
3645880	3649240	because the game itself didn't look to be a lot of fun, at least when I saw Loki playing
3649240	3655200	it a long time ago, um, it, it was, for fans of The Matrix, they were continually building
3655200	3656560	in this, that universe.
3656560	3657560	They were continually the story.
3657560	3658560	They really were.
3658560	3663760	Didn't they kill off one of the major characters from the movie, like, in the game or something?
3663760	3668440	Uh, I don't, I don't remember, I just, kinda asking that out loud, I'm sure I'd get a response
3668440	3669440	from chat.
3669440	3672660	Really, I didn't keep up with it enough to notice, so.
3672660	3673660	Thank you.
3673660	3674660	Morpheus, apparently, allegedly died.
3674660	3676200	I thought one of the main characters there.
3676200	3677560	Well, who misses him?
3677560	3682040	Chat.orangelandraday.com, well, if you're a fan of The Matrix series, then you might.
3682040	3687600	So, alright, well, uh, we'll see, um, I guess, uh, if, uh, any pirate servers pop up or what
3687600	3691200	the, what game these fans plan to go to, if anything.
3691200	3692200	Yes.
3692200	3698200	And, as, uh, The Matrix Online dies, another thing comes back from the dead.
3698200	3699200	What?
3699200	3706000	EGM, actually, is back now, um, to the, you know, praise of many of its fans.
3706000	3712000	Um, apparently, EGM was sold to its original founder, and, um, he's planning on starting
3712000	3718280	a publication in print and as well as online, and, uh, no word yet if, you know, any of
3718280	3724420	the staff members that were fired, you know, back when UGO bought up, um, the 1UP brand,
3724420	3728060	if they're going to, somehow, um, you know, bring those people back.
3728060	3731180	Maybe some people will return back, you know, I'm sure if they're asked, but, um, they have
3731180	3736120	an exciting plan for, um, you know, taking this magazine to the next evolution, they
3736120	3740140	say, so, um, it's interesting, though, because that was actually a pretty good magazine.
3740140	3747040	With it gone, it's pretty much just Game Informer, which is in bed.
3747040	3751300	You know, um, is there a lot, now, an interesting question is, playing devil's advocate here,
3751300	3754760	especially in this economy, in this world we live in, with the internet and everything,
3754760	3756860	is there a demand for print publication?
3756860	3759880	I think, well, I mean, like, Game Informer's pretty good.
3759880	3766000	Um, you know, I, if, I wouldn't probably voluntarily sign up for it, unless, you know, I get the
3766000	3770400	discount cards through GameStop, and that's really the only incentive, but, um, you know,
3770400	3774360	they've had a lot of exclusive stories lately, and probably because they're GameStop and
3774360	3780600	can afford to say, hey, give us the exclusive story on this, or, um, you know, we won't
3780600	3784800	buy as much, you know, that type of stuff, so.
3784800	3787840	Which has to violate some type of antitrust law, just by the way.
3787840	3788840	Or it could be the other way around.
3788840	3791640	It could be that they're giving them that because they're like, hey, look at, you know,
3791640	3797080	our user base, you know, for this magazine, it's huge, and yeah, it is huge because you,
3797080	3802400	you get it when you sign up for this card that basically pays for itself pretty quick.
3802400	3803400	I don't know.
3803400	3808680	Um, it's not bad, but still, I think there is room for more, you know, gaming publications
3808680	3809680	out there.
3809680	3813560	I mean, hell, I mean, EGM hasn't even gone that long.
3813560	3817520	Well, you know what, one thing I am gonna appreciate for Electronic Gaming Monthly being
3817520	3818520	back is that now-
3818520	3820360	You're a game pro if you need to get rid of one.
3820360	3823520	One thing I do miss about Electronic Gaming Monthly is that now I'll have something to
3823520	3828380	read on the shitter again, because what a better, what better place to read video gaming
3828380	3832380	magazines, because, you know, certainly some of the articles in Electronic Gaming Monthly
3832380	3838760	make me want to facilitate release, so I'm extremely happy that I will have a new bathroom
3838760	3839760	reader.
3839760	3841420	Rob, you're such a goof.
3841420	3842420	So there you go.
3842420	3845720	EGM coming soon to a bathroom near you.
3845720	3850960	Hey, uh, hopefully not gonna end up in your bathroom, but in your, uh, console.
3850960	3857160	Squeenix has a brand new, believe it or not, it's not Final Fantasy XIV, it's not, you
3857160	3862000	know, Kingdom Hearts XI, it is a brand new franchise, it's something called N.I.E.R.
3862000	3866000	Nier, although that might be a little bit deceptive, because I guess it's like a new
3866000	3867400	type of front mission game.
3867400	3868400	No, no.
3868400	3869400	There's two different games.
3869400	3870400	Oh, okay.
3870400	3871400	It's two different ones.
3871400	3872400	Phew.
3872400	3873400	Okay, so N.I.E.R.
3873400	3874400	Nier is, uh, one of the, oh, okay, I see what you're saying.
3874400	3876760	It's a hack and slash action game, it looks fucking awesome.
3876760	3877760	Really?
3877760	3878760	I didn't look at the videos of this yet.
3878760	3879760	Yeah, you need to.
3879760	3880760	What's it kinda look like?
3880760	3887960	Um, I don't know, it's just, it's really like, um, like a bloody action game, I mean, you
3887960	3892760	know, there's not, it's not like a Castlevania or anything like that, it's just really cool
3892760	3893760	looking.
3893760	3897480	Well apparently this is a game being developed by the Bullet Witch and Resident Evil Umbrella
3897480	3905120	Chronicles Makers, same folks who made those games, but it wasn't Bullet Witch kinda, no.
3905120	3910520	I hope they learn their lesson, because, uh, see, it kinda sucks, because Umbrella Chronicles
3910520	3917520	wasn't that bad, but Bullet Witch was really fucking bad, so, uh, that's tough.
3917520	3921940	By the way, just kind of on a side note, this is a Final Fantasy and the PSP bundle that
3921940	3923720	will be coming with it, August 25th.
3923720	3926640	Yeah, the new front mission game that's coming out is gonna be a little bit different, because
3926640	3930160	you remember, front mission is more of a tactical strategy game, whereas this one's gonna be
3930160	3935080	like Armored Core, it's just, you know, get in the mech, kill things, which I can get
3935080	3936080	behind that.
3936080	3938920	Shadow Next Gen in chat says, I want Kingdom Hearts 3, dammit.
3938920	3939920	You know what, me too.
3939920	3943300	Like, I know they have these spin-off games coming this year, and sadly I think that's
3943300	3947260	all we're gonna get is the DS and PSP Kingdom Hearts games that, you know, I think the ones
3947260	3950840	that are coming out in Japan are gonna come here too inevitably, but you know what, Disney
3950840	3954960	has a huge booth at E3 this year, and granted I know they have all their little, you know,
3954960	3959360	Hannah Montana and, you know, whatever type games that they do, which is probably in reality
3959360	3964520	all you're gonna see there, there's a part of me that just really hopes maybe Kingdom
3964520	3965880	Hearts 3 is a surprise announcement.
3965880	3967600	They have split second, which looks awesome.
3967600	3972440	At least something, throw me a frickin' bone here, show me a new teaser trailer, give me
3972440	3976060	something to look forward to in 2010 after Final Fantasy 13 is out.
3976060	3980000	You know, I would hope if nothing else, if they do the whole Square Theater or whatever
3980000	3983200	again, that we see a little bit of a tease of Kingdom Hearts 3.
3983200	3986960	Well, Square likes to tease games that aren't coming out for a few years anyway, so...
3986960	3988720	And that's all I'm asking for.
3988720	3990840	Just let me know it's really happening.
3990840	3995380	Remind me that Kingdom Hearts 3 is happening, remind me that you're not gonna do this weird
3995380	4000120	ass spinoff that makes no sense to a seven year old like you were trying to show at the
4000120	4002720	end of Kingdom Hearts 2, like, remember that?
4002720	4003720	That was awesome.
4003720	4006560	It was awesome, but what the fuck did it have to do with Disney?
4006560	4007560	Nothing.
4007560	4008560	Show me...
4008560	4010120	What does Kingdom Hearts really have to do with Disney?
4010120	4013160	Not a lot, but dammit, it gives me something to look forward to.
4013160	4016440	I'm surprised we haven't seen anything Kingdom Hearts related in Disneyland.
4016440	4022400	Well, that's a whole nother story, because technically it's licensed, it's not a part
4022400	4027640	of Disney, so you don't really see, I mean, but in Japan, apparently they have more, and
4027640	4032360	I'll tell you what, one time, I think I told this on the show, one trip I took to Disneyland,
4032360	4034960	was it with you, Darkseid, or was it...
4034960	4035960	I don't remember when it was.
4035960	4040600	I don't remember if it was this March or if it was last, the time before, but we actually
4040600	4042320	saw a little kid dressed up as Sora.
4042320	4043320	Yeah, we did.
4043320	4044320	In the park.
4044320	4045320	In a haunted mansion.
4045320	4046320	I thought I was with you.
4046320	4049040	We saw him in line for a haunted mansion, so sometimes you see it, you know, I don't
4049040	4050720	know, but it's just, you know, random.
4050720	4053200	Because remember they were from Australia or something, and the costume was really well
4053200	4054200	done.
4054200	4055200	That was right.
4055200	4056200	And then they asked him to leave.
4056200	4059080	No, they didn't ask him, because you're allowed to be dressed up in the park if you're a kid.
4059080	4060080	Yep.
4060080	4066140	So, anyhow, I've ever seen one thing in the park, Kingdom Hearts related, one thing, official
4066140	4070700	Disney in the park, and that was a California venture in the collectible store they were
4070700	4073920	selling where they sell all the little mini statues, I saw as Sora.
4073920	4075760	That's the only thing I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related.
4075760	4076760	Really?
4076760	4077760	Yes.
4077760	4078760	I haven't seen that at all.
4078760	4079760	Yes.
4079760	4080760	And it was gone when I looked again this last time I was there.
4080760	4085000	So, I guess it's kind of like Where's Waldo across two theme parks.
4085000	4086000	Where's Sora.
4086000	4087000	Where's Sora.
4087000	4088000	Good luck.
4088000	4092280	Anyhow, more stories, if we could.
4092280	4093520	Dark Sakura.
4093520	4099240	Well, as I mentioned, I believe it was last week, there was the rumor about Wolfenstein
4099240	4106880	3D coming out, and it is going to be on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
4106880	4110360	It will be June 4th and June 5th, respectively.
4110360	4112440	That means Xbox fans get it first.
4112440	4113440	Ha ha.
4113440	4115240	Bringing it home.
4115240	4116240	Huh?
4116240	4120640	That's part of the E3 is bringing it home, or, you know, where Microsoft does that bringing
4120640	4121640	it home thing.
4121640	4122640	Oh, okay.
4122640	4123640	They have demos.
4123640	4128240	I bet you anything we're going to see a Lost Planet 2 demo coming this week, since they
4128240	4130800	said they were going to do that anyways.
4130800	4134160	Maybe I'll get some cool new shirts for my avatar, whoopty shit.
4134160	4142120	But there will be, actually, um, of course, achievements, whatever you want to call it.
4142120	4147520	And also for the new Wolfenstein game, there's going to be, um, you can earn accolades and
4147520	4151880	be awarded gold for customizable weapon upgrades for the new Wolfenstein, so that'll be pretty
4151880	4152880	cool.
4152880	4154760	And that, of course, is coming out on August 4th.
4154760	4156160	No idea on price yet.
4156160	4157160	Sorry.
4157160	4158160	I don't know.
4158160	4159160	It'll probably be 10 bucks.
4159160	4160160	They're all 10 bucks.
4160160	4161160	I want to shoot Hitler in the head.
4161160	4162160	They're all, I, I...
4162160	4163160	It should be five bucks.
4163160	4164840	I want to shoot a giant pixelated Hitler.
4164840	4169400	I mean, Wolfenstein 3D, honestly, I, unless they did something really cool with this,
4169400	4172240	which I, you know, I heard about the whole integration with the new Wolfenstein or whatever,
4172240	4176000	I'm sorry, that's not enough, unless they did something really fucking cool, like suddenly
4176000	4180480	put multiplayer in it somehow, which I doubt they did, I don't think it's worth it, because
4180480	4185800	if the game was not that great by today's standards, was it an important and revolutionary
4185800	4189380	game at the time, yes, but does it hold up to today's standards?
4189380	4190380	Hell the fuck no.
4190380	4192880	You are going to download this and be, why did I waste $10?
4192880	4195120	Remember PUBGAMES Fable 2?
4195120	4196680	Remember how that was going to integrate stuff?
4196680	4197920	Remember how crappy those were?
4197920	4198920	Yeah.
4198920	4199920	I don't, I'm not falling for that twice.
4199920	4200920	Sorry.
4200920	4203640	Um, I'm going to get it.
4203640	4205480	I love, I freaking love Wolfenstein.
4205480	4208640	I love Doom, and I also love Duke Nukem 3D.
4208640	4212600	Bought both of those, played them for about, you know, 30 minutes, and then that was it.
4212600	4213600	You're like, yay, nostalgia.
4213600	4215020	Okay, done now.
4215020	4216720	I will, I will bet money.
4216720	4220160	I will bet money Dark Soccer does the same thing.
4220160	4222200	She'll buy it, play it for 30 minutes, and be done.
4222200	4225800	No, that is if I actually go through with buying it.
4225800	4231800	And it's nothing against, I'm just saying, it's the same thing, the same nostalgia bug,
4231800	4235000	the same nostalgia bug that, that, that you and me.
4235000	4238120	Honestly, honestly, honestly, this is really what I'm going to do is probably just freaking
4238120	4242160	download it and play it on my computer like, you know, God intended.
4242160	4245080	Marissa Cunguso in chat says, anyone remember Heretic?
4245080	4249400	Hell yeah, I'm sorry, I was the big Hexen fan.
4249400	4255160	Now if, if that and Hexen come out on Xbox Live, we will play that for hours, guaranteed.
4255160	4257440	We'll just, we will stream it on the internet to prove it.
4257440	4259400	I will go on leave from work and play it.
4259400	4262760	We will play like eight, eight hours of that game on a weekend.
4262760	4263800	We will, we will do it.
4263800	4266320	I will watch Rob do it too.
4266320	4269200	Gee, thanks.
4269200	4270200	You're a real pal.
4270200	4271200	No, I will.
4271200	4272200	I'd play.
4272200	4273200	I'd do it.
4273200	4274200	All right, good.
4274200	4275200	Cause I might want to like sleep at some point or eat.
4275200	4276200	I don't know.
4276200	4277200	During those eight hours.
4277200	4278200	You're not allowed to eat anymore, Rob.
4278200	4282040	If you release what Heretic or Hexen or both or which one?
4282040	4285080	They should do a pack.
4285080	4289040	All right, so if Heretic and Hexen come out on Xbox Live Arcade, Dark Soccer and I will
4289040	4290560	do an eight hour marathon.
4290560	4291560	We will.
4291560	4292560	We will.
4292560	4294200	No, we will do a 24 hour marathon.
4294200	4295200	No.
4295200	4296200	Yes.
4296200	4298960	We will do the Uber marathon.
4298960	4301160	Is there enough gameplay to last for 24 hours?
4301160	4302160	I guess.
4302160	4303160	We'll find a way.
4303160	4304160	All right.
4304160	4305160	Isn't there like multiple episodes or something?
4305160	4306160	All right.
4306160	4311680	Look, there are too many bets being made tonight and I'm really afraid, I'm really afraid the
4311680	4313280	public is going to win one of them.
4313280	4316560	So you know what, Rob, you know what my, my thought is on bets?
4316560	4317560	What?
4317560	4320240	I never intend on going through with them, so why?
4320240	4321240	You're a bad bet maker.
4321240	4324160	I fully intended on going through with the Eye of Judgment thing.
4324160	4329400	If somebody says, Hey, we heard about this bet, we just sold another 750,000 copies of
4329400	4332040	it, which will never happen.
4332040	4334900	But if it did, then yes, I would go through with the bet.
4334900	4338480	He would have done it and it would have, you wouldn't have half asked it either.
4338480	4341400	It would have been to the wife would have made the costume.
4341400	4344520	It would have been tremendous things that could have been, but no, nobody had to buy
4344520	4345520	Eye of Judgment.
4345520	4347440	We're even going to have him go through the happy tingle dance.
4347440	4350640	When Loki makes the bet, he makes the damn bet.
4350640	4351640	He's a man.
4351640	4352640	I will say this.
4352640	4354760	I was done the show with Loki a long time, known the man many years.
4354760	4357120	He is a man of his word.
4357120	4359840	And God forbid they try to make a sequel.
4359840	4364720	And no, I don't think I will, I don't know whether, we'll have to look at this.
4364720	4368000	Yeah, it depends whether you don't say anything until you see, because the sequel could be
4368000	4369480	cool if there is one.
4369480	4371680	So you want to just, you want to watch it, Loki.
4371680	4373840	Watch it.
4373840	4377640	Something that probably will be cool, but I won't be picking it up.
4377640	4378640	Guitar Hero 5.
4378640	4382440	It will be coming out a little bit earlier this year, September 1st.
4382440	4386640	And of course, you know, new to Guitar Hero 5 will be a new party play mode where you
4386640	4390280	mix up what instruments you have.
4390280	4393980	And also, you know, kind of, I think drop in and drop out play as well, which is kind
4393980	4395520	of sweet.
4395520	4399800	And there's also a confirmation, a full confirmation of all the artists that will be featured in
4399800	4401120	the game.
4401120	4403840	And actually a pretty long list.
4403840	4410280	Even there's some that I wouldn't have thought would normally be in, in like Guitar Hero.
4410280	4413900	Like we had the Gorillaz, which was in there, confirmed.
4413900	4417440	I mean, that's, do they have any really guitar friendly songs?
4417440	4419280	Well, yeah.
4419280	4433040	I mean, let's see here, Blur, Blink-182, Iron Maiden, Duran Duran, Tom Petty, Nirvana, Smashing
4433040	4436920	Pumpkins, David Bowie, Johnny Cash.
4436920	4443880	One that made me excited, Rammstein is going to be in there, Beck, Garbage, Billy Idol,
4443880	4444880	finally.
4444880	4445880	One that made me perk up.
4445880	4446880	I love Garbage.
4446880	4447880	Queen and David Bowie.
4447880	4448880	Okay.
4448880	4449880	Oh.
4449880	4450880	That means you're getting under pressure.
4450880	4451880	Under pressure?
4451880	4452880	Probably.
4452880	4453880	Oh.
4453880	4456480	I just bought Guitar Hero 5, son of a bitch.
4456480	4457480	Son of a bitch.
4457480	4460660	That's like the one song I have to have.
4460660	4461660	You all know it.
4461660	4462660	You out there listening.
4462660	4466680	You know there is that one song you have to have if you haven't already got it.
4466680	4470460	There's that one song you have to have that's going to make you buy the game regardless.
4470460	4471460	And he just said it.
4471460	4472460	Elton John.
4472460	4479800	Oh man, there's like, I don't know, it looks pretty cool in deep purple.
4479800	4482160	So maybe we'll get Highway Star in there again.
4482160	4483960	I love Highway Star.
4483960	4484960	Alright.
4484960	4485960	Sweet.
4485960	4487760	And that's just a selection of some of the stuff there, but they have the full list that's
4487760	4488760	out there now.
4488760	4494920	Apparently it was leaked out by a UK magazine, I believe the UK equivalent to like Rolling
4494920	4497720	Stone or something posted the full list.
4497720	4501800	But we'll hear more about Guitar Hero 5 and you'll actually get to see it.
4501800	4504200	In a few days.
4504200	4506600	Alright well we got just a little more news for you and then we're going to get to the
4506600	4509440	classic game of the week and this has to do with Nintendo.
4509440	4512000	Now the leaks aren't just kept to Sony.
4512000	4516480	Nintendo might have leaked some things out thanks to some trademarks they've been filing.
4516480	4519600	One of the trademarks that have been filed, Wii Fit Plus.
4519600	4524560	Now here's the thing, apparently this was already found out a few months ago through
4524560	4529560	some retailer listings, but now this title has officially been trademarked in Japan.
4529560	4532440	There's also a logo to go with it, so you know what?
4532440	4534840	This is probably something you're going to see at E3.
4534840	4542960	In fact, apparently some news leaks have come out of E3 that apparently yes, Wii Fit Plus
4542960	4544480	is a real deal.
4544480	4547160	Wii Motion Plus is going to be supported.
4547160	4550260	That's a big part of this game is that now they'll be able to detect the motion a little
4550260	4554040	better and it's going to have online functionality.
4554040	4555800	Very limited online functionality.
4555800	4559440	This is probably just sharing data across the internet so you can motivate each other.
4559440	4561600	Which is okay.
4561600	4566400	It's not something to buy the game over, but I got to be honest, I think a lot of people
4566400	4571580	give Wii Fit a really hard time because we're core gamers, but if you look at this from
4571580	4577880	the perspective of it gets people up off the couch and it's not boring.
4577880	4580000	I was playing Wii Fit religiously for a couple weeks.
4580000	4581760	I really need to get back into doing it.
4581760	4584320	I fell out of the habit and I shouldn't have done that.
4584320	4588440	Next to going to a gym, it's not a bad thing.
4588440	4591320	I got to say, I'm very interested in Wii Fit Plus.
4591320	4595000	As embarrassed as I am to say it, I'm interested to see what they do with it.
4595000	4599240	I know, and that's kind of cool that they're putting out another game that some of these
4599240	4603680	people that bought Wii Fit are going to buy, but they just keep putting out sequels to
4603680	4604920	games that they already have.
4604920	4610580	Yes, I know that everybody releases sequels, but my god, okay, seriously, let's see here.
4610580	4612420	Wii Sports Resort.
4612420	4617020	Wii Sports 2 basically, which has games that repeat themselves.
4617020	4618020	Hold up though.
4618020	4622160	Wii Sports, like if it's not the top selling console game of all time at this point, one
4622160	4623160	of the top.
4623160	4624160	Come on.
4624160	4625160	Give them.
4625160	4626160	They've got to have a Wii Sports 2.
4626160	4627700	That may be true.
4627700	4630920	You know there's going to be a Mario, which by the way, next part of the story, rumor
4630920	4634520	is the Mario is the big unveiling at E3, the new Mario game.
4634520	4636480	Why aren't we seeing anything new?
4636480	4637480	Anything innovative?
4637480	4640400	It's basically just rehashes of old stuff.
4640400	4642520	Because rehashes are what people want to see.
4642520	4643520	Guess what?
4643520	4646560	We could have had more motion sensors, but we were cheap and decided not to put in there,
4646560	4651760	but hey, now if you buy this, buy more accessories that we're going to sell you now, you can
4651760	4656260	buy the same game again with now some online functionality, which should have been in there
4656260	4662360	in the first place, and you can have some enhanced motion capturing that should have
4662360	4664520	been in there in the first place.
4664520	4665680	Awesome.
4665680	4667760	I get to pay for your mistakes.
4667760	4668760	Again.
4668760	4673000	Oh wait, no, I don't have to because I'm not buying it.
4673000	4674000	Comments from chat.
4674000	4675000	Chat.orensondrader.com.
4675000	4676000	Tell us what you really feel.
4676000	4679720	Entertainment says next year they'll have Wii Fit++ with Wii Motion Plus, Wii Vision
4679720	4681360	Plus and Wii Internet Plus.
4681360	4684920	Marissa Congusto says, I refer back to my old comment that video games are turning into
4684920	4688660	porns with multiple sequels and endless sequel numbers.
4688660	4690560	Same content, different cast.
4690560	4696080	INGN0, I think Ingo I can say, I'm not sure if there's a pronunciation of that and I forgot
4696080	4697080	it.
4697080	4698080	Sorry.
4698080	4704240	The only non-Nintendo game that is good on the Wii is Mad World.
4704240	4707960	By the way, one other thing I wanted to say, one other game that was trademarked by Nintendo,
4707960	4708960	Art Academy.
4708960	4712000	So, maybe that's something new.
4712000	4713000	Question mark.
4713000	4714000	Hope it's Mario Paint 2.
4714000	4715000	That would be cool.
4715000	4716000	Okay, well wait a minute!
4716000	4720440	You just said you didn't want to see sequels, and now you're like, give me Mario Paint 2!
4720440	4722020	That would be new though, okay?
4722020	4723020	That would be new.
4723020	4725120	They could do more innovative stuff with Mario Paint 2.
4725120	4730240	Now if they just put Mario Paint, new Wii control, you know, Mario Paint or whatever,
4730240	4735280	with the Wii controls now to the old game, then yes, that would be rehash crap.
4735280	4740200	But this is basically Wii Fit, you know, maybe they'll have some different mini games in
4740200	4741200	there.
4741200	4742200	Whoopee!
4742200	4743200	You know?
4743200	4746720	And they're gonna just, you know, throw it back at the consumer again.
4746720	4747720	And guess what?
4747720	4752360	The Nintendo consumer's dumb enough to buy this stuff again, and so the cycle will never
4752360	4756560	end, and the people who actually want to play good games on the system will never get to
4756560	4757680	play those good games.
4757680	4759180	So you know what?
4759180	4760680	You just have to move on.
4760680	4763680	Which I have.
4763680	4767560	Rama in chat says, with all these motion controller adapters, it's just a matter of time before
4767560	4769560	we see masturbation in the game.
4769560	4773400	And that is what we're hoping to see from the Korean developers at E3, and damn it,
4773400	4777400	if masturbation in the game is at E3, OLR will bring it to you, because no one else
4777400	4779400	will.
4779400	4781800	No one else will want to.
4781800	4785000	No one else will want to touch it, literally.
4785000	4786560	Fanboy wank the game!
4786560	4788840	We did play 3 Feel that one time.
4788840	4795320	I, we did, we extensively covered 3 Feel on this show, and what the hell ever happened
4795320	4796320	to that game?
4796320	4799800	That's what I love about E3, I'll play all these games, I will never fucking see them.
4799800	4803520	Whatever happened to that one game that was like a 360 game about some guy that was like
4803520	4806640	Spring Break or something, you can go on panty raids and stuff like that.
4806640	4808600	Remember, whatever happened to that?
4808600	4809600	I don't know.
4809600	4810600	You know what did come out?
4810600	4811600	Tulip came out.
4811600	4812800	Tulip did come out, finally.
4812800	4813800	The smooching game.
4813800	4814800	After like two years.
4814800	4815800	And X-Tango!
4815800	4816840	Still no X-Tango.
4816840	4817840	We need an X-Tango!
4817840	4818840	I'm sorry.
4818840	4819840	That game had so much potential.
4819840	4823800	We should go hold these people down and go, why the hell haven't you released your game,
4823800	4824800	you lazy bastard?
4824800	4827120	Give me some X-Tango or I'll smack you down.
4827120	4828120	Hey, look.
4828120	4829120	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4829120	4830120	Hold on, guys.
4830120	4831120	Hold on.
4831120	4832120	Serious moment here.
4832120	4834280	The reality of the situation is none of those games could get picked up because the fact
4834280	4838720	people are wanting their Mario 2s and people are wanting more of the same thing.
4838720	4840840	The, the, the, serious guys.
4840840	4843720	That's why these games fizzled because they couldn't get the backing.
4843720	4845840	No they could have put out an Xbox Live Arcade.
4845840	4846840	They could easily do that.
4846840	4847840	They weren't XNA.
4847840	4849240	Well, define easily.
4849240	4851000	The money dries up at some point.
4851000	4852000	Who's paying for it?
4852000	4853000	The game's done.
4853000	4854000	Just port it.
4854000	4855000	They just need a distributor.
4855000	4856060	Somebody has to port it.
4856060	4857400	You have to pay someone to port it.
4857400	4859200	It's not just Presto Chainjo.
4859200	4860200	It's on Xbox Live.
4860200	4861200	Yes it is.
4861200	4862200	There are small game publishers out there that will do that.
4862200	4868360	I mean, there, there's people picking up rights to like M&Ms and fucking Jelly Belly and stuff
4868360	4869880	because they think that's an awesome IP.
4869880	4870880	Oh my god, it's recognizable.
4870880	4873960	Because people buy that shit.
4873960	4878360	I mean, if I put out a game that was like Nabisco something or other, I mean, no one's
4878360	4880760	gonna pick that up.
4880760	4885960	Lego My Eggo, you know, the game, I mean, Nabisco presents X-Tango.
4885960	4890200	I would pay, I would play Nabisco presents X-Tango.
4890200	4893360	You know, it's like, uh, Dancing for Oreos.
4893360	4895560	I would play Cookie Dancing the game.
4895560	4899960	Purina Dogchow presents, you know, it's like, oh great, X-Alpo.
4899960	4900960	X-Alpo.
4900960	4905920	Anyways, I'm gonna look and see what happened to 3-Feel.
4905920	4906920	Please do.
4906920	4908280	I want you, will you do that during the break?
4908280	4909280	Will you try to research?
4909280	4915240	I want to find out what happened to 3-Feel, X-Tango, and uh, what was the other one?
4915240	4917960	Anything, anything that we've talked about from the old Kinsha Hall's day, because it's
4917960	4921440	been like three years since we've been to an E3 because we didn't get invited the hotel
4921440	4922440	years.
4922440	4923440	So the years that don't count.
4923440	4924440	All right.
4924440	4927600	Look, we got, uh, the classic game of the week we got to get to.
4927600	4930520	We got to find out what's happened to some really old games.
4930520	4931520	Really old?
4931520	4932520	How old is really old?
4932520	4933520	Dark, I don't know.
4933520	4934520	I guess it's all relative.
4934520	4938640	Dark Sakura is going to dig through her archive of games and find a game to highlight just
4938640	4941440	for you guys and what the heck is going on with it.
4941440	4943160	It's called the classic game of the week.
4943160	4944760	Here it is here on Orange Launch Radio.
4944760	4948800	What is the classic game of the week that all the kids should be playing, Dark Sakura?
4948800	4953520	The classic game of the week is, I'm actually going into the arcade archives.
4953520	4958440	Even though there were home releases of this, I'm gonna really focus on the arcade version,
4958440	4961320	and that's a game called Star Blade.
4961320	4973000	And yeah, I put up our customary, you know, audio thing, but for when it came out, that's
4973000	4976600	a pretty good audio.
4976600	4987800	So this particular game was in a special pod cabinet put out by Namco, and it was running
4987800	4992320	on the Namco System 21 hardware at the time.
4992320	4998040	This game came out when I think I was still in, yeah I was still in high school, it came
4998040	5002480	out in 1991, and I was all over this game.
5002480	5009320	My dollar theater had it, and the guys there used to put it on free play for me.
5009320	5011720	So I have beaten Star Blade a number of times.
5011720	5019320	But the way that it goes is you have a really large 2-axis 4-button controller with an LED
5019320	5020320	lamp.
5020320	5024520	So basically, you flash it as you shoot them.
5024520	5032760	When you get hit, the seat rumbles and you get strobes going off, so that it would be
5032760	5038080	like you actually saw the lasers hitting you, you'd be temporarily blinded, you know, just
5038080	5041160	like you would with a photo flash.
5041160	5050360	It also had a 30 VDC motor that had an asymmetrical axis, so the seating effect, the shaking would
5050360	5053480	be really random, it was on three cylinders.
5053480	5057880	But yeah, it is a shoot-em-up game.
5057880	5061960	You are flying out through space and you're shooting all the bad guys.
5061960	5067560	They have big flashing red sections kind of like it did in Star Fox.
5067560	5072480	But basically, you just go around and just shoot stuff.
5072480	5073480	It's a lot of fun.
5073480	5074760	It's a lot, a lot of fun.
5074760	5078180	Really kind of a difficult game, too.
5078180	5082880	This kind of looks very Star Wars-ish to me, like the Star Wars arcade game that they had
5082880	5084600	out looks a little bit like it.
5084600	5086680	It just kind of reminds me of it, the way it's set up.
5086680	5087680	A little bit.
5087680	5091360	There's actually got some more interesting stuff to it, though.
5091360	5095840	Just to go into the sound, it actually had this four-speaker surround sound, even though
5095840	5102720	it was only two-channel, they had it to where it would go through four speakers, so it was
5102720	5103720	pretty cool.
5103720	5113400	Now, this is the fun thing, is that we got this on Sega CD and 3DO in 1994 in its original
5113400	5114880	way it looked.
5114880	5123160	However, on PlayStation we got Starblade Alpha, which had a textured mode.
5123160	5126000	You could play it with textures or whatever.
5126000	5128320	Before it was just like, you know, basic.
5128320	5129320	Very Star Fox.
5129320	5130320	Imagine Star Fox.
5130320	5131320	That's what the graphics look like.
5131320	5132320	I know we're radio.
5132320	5133320	Imagine Star Fox.
5133320	5134320	Thank you, Cleaner.
5134320	5135320	Yeah.
5135320	5136320	You know.
5136320	5138280	But it's a really fantastic game.
5138280	5145120	Now here's the fun thing about it, it actually had another incarnation called Galaxian 3
5145120	5146120	Project Dragoon.
5146120	5147840	Do you remember anything about that?
5147840	5149280	No, but I wanted to say really quick.
5149280	5151320	No wonder we go in the big room and play it.
5151320	5154920	I can see this game's influence on Star Fox.
5154920	5157600	This game looks a lot like Star Fox to me.
5157600	5161360	Like it's a mix of Star Wars the arcade game and Star Fox.
5161360	5164320	I never played this game back in the day, but it looks a lot like it.
5164320	5169400	Like just the graphics, the way things flash that you are supposed to target and kill.
5169400	5170400	Wow.
5170400	5178080	Well, Galaxian 3 is a walk-in style game that runs off a laserdisc and the arcade hardware,
5178080	5180440	so it has some pre-rendered stuff going on in the background.
5180440	5182240	It's super awesome, too.
5182240	5188760	But it was out for Namco's Theater 6 arcade system, which the only other game that came
5188760	5192520	out was Attack of the Zul'gir.
5192520	5196360	The cool thing about this, though, is that actually a lot of the audio from Star Blade
5196360	5199680	made it into Galaxian 3.
5199680	5205240	The path of the game is almost identical, you know, through the asteroid field with
5205240	5210040	battleships going through the planet, desert canyons, blah, blah, blah.
5210040	5213520	And the music in it was a rearrangement of Star Blade.
5213520	5217000	So Star Blade led directly to Galaxian 3.
5217000	5220440	It's a predecessor.
5220440	5230560	Also, do you know how Tekken 5 had their loading screens that had different games?
5230560	5235540	Star Blade was in Tekken 5, so that always made me go for it.
5235540	5237400	Someone in chat actually recognized that, too.
5237400	5240880	And it was unlockable in the arcade history area of the game.
5240880	5246840	And Star Blade also shows up in Ridge Racer 7 as a wheels manufacturer, so it has wheels
5246840	5248840	from the game.
5248840	5255680	There was supposed to be a sequel to it that was called Star Blade Operation Blue Planet,
5255680	5258960	but the game never made production.
5258960	5266720	It was supposed to be running on the Namco Orbs cabinet with a projector and a slide-in
5266720	5269440	scene and everything, so it was supposed to be pretty neat.
5269440	5274280	But it never happened, which is a damn shame, fie!
5274280	5276720	But that's totally my game of the week.
5276720	5282520	Alright, there you have it, your classic game of the week, Star Blade, on the arcade.
5282520	5287040	I'm sorry, that's a game that still, I think, holds solid today.
5287040	5292440	It may look a little dated, but if you can find one in the cabinet, plunk the money into
5292440	5293880	it, it's well worth it.
5293880	5294880	Alright.
5294880	5298080	It's a very well-received pick by the chat room as well, a lot of fans of that game in
5298080	5299080	chat.
5299080	5301720	It is seriously, for arcade games, it's one of my favorites.
5301720	5302720	Alright.
5302720	5304800	Well, we are going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5304800	5307760	I need to rest my voice, I need to get some more tea or something hot to drink, because
5307760	5309920	you can hear I'm getting the whole puberty thing going on again.
5309920	5310920	I have tons of tea.
5310920	5314120	And we're going to rest a little bit, our voices, take a quick break, come back in Part
5314120	5318120	B. We haven't even touched Microsoft News yet, and believe me, there's a lot of it,
5318120	5319120	so we're going to get to that after the break.
5319120	5320760	And of course, your call's a little later on.
5320760	5324160	It's probably going to be a bit of a long show tonight, so buckle up and hold on.
5324160	5326800	We'll get through it together, guys.
5326800	5335720	We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5335720	5339280	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the
5339280	5344180	31st of 2009, where we are taping live on All Games Radio, as we do every Sunday night.
5344180	5348280	The fun begins around 6 o'clock Pacific, but sometimes we're on the phone with Bobby Blackwolf,
5348280	5352080	the guy who goes before us with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and it will cause
5352080	5354360	us to start a little late, is what happened tonight.
5354360	5355360	But that's OK.
5355360	5358480	We've still got plenty of stuff to talk to you guys about, so let's get right back into
5358480	5359480	it.
5359480	5360480	Enough BS.
5360480	5362240	Hopefully, you've already heard Part A. I don't know why you would.
5362240	5366160	I guess maybe if you're joining us late here live on this Sunday evening, then shame on
5366160	5368840	you for missing Part A, but you missed a lot about Sony and Nintendo.
5368840	5372240	Now we're going to get into Microsoft News, right, Logie?
5372240	5373240	Yes.
5373240	5376520	The rumored Zune HD is real.
5376520	5384600	Microsoft has now officially unveiled it, and what it will do is also tie the Zune Marketplace
5384600	5388400	into the Xbox 360, which is going to be pretty cool.
5388400	5395680	They're actually planning on mainly adding, I think, the music portion of the Zune Marketplace,
5395680	5403200	perhaps showing you how to buy the Zune Pass and stuff like that, so you can download songs.
5403200	5408960	Also they're going to have, you know, maybe a different music service on top of that that's
5408960	5414520	going to be similar to the Zune Marketplace for the 360, which is kind of cool.
5414520	5418080	And the system itself actually looks pretty, like, sleeker.
5418080	5419080	I don't know.
5419080	5423680	It looks kind of neat, and a lot bigger screen.
5423680	5424680	I don't know.
5424680	5425680	It's pretty cool.
5425680	5430440	I'm sure they're going to show a little bit, I mean, even though it's not really gaming,
5430440	5435560	they may show a little bit more of it during a Microsoft press conference tomorrow, but
5435560	5436560	I don't know.
5436560	5438560	It looks kind of cool.
5438560	5442560	I kind of want to get one.
5442560	5443560	Really?
5443560	5444560	Maybe.
5444560	5445560	I don't know.
5445560	5447080	I have my new stereo in the car.
5447080	5452760	This is interesting, though, from you, because you usually are not a big portable person.
5452760	5456440	I know you have a lot of iPhone hate, but it would be interesting to see you get the
5456440	5458480	Zune out of all this.
5458480	5461360	What is it about this that makes you excited?
5461360	5469080	Well, apparently they're going to integrate the Zune into Xbox Live, creating a game-changing
5469080	5473560	entertainment experience, as they say, but that could be just a whole bunch of PR fluff.
5473560	5474560	I don't know.
5474560	5476280	I have to see what functions they're actually going to do.
5476280	5479800	Remember, they were talking back before that they're going to have X and A games available
5479800	5482400	to play on the Zune, so that might be kind of cool.
5482400	5483400	I don't know.
5483400	5484400	We'll see.
5484400	5488520	I probably won't end up actually getting one, but it would be neat to see what they're going
5488520	5489640	to offer for it.
5489640	5490640	All right.
5490640	5496000	Well, I guess we will see what happens as more is revealed on the Zune HD.
5496000	5499980	I'm sure this is going to be one of the big things at Microsoft's press conference, which
5499980	5504600	is weird, though, because this is not necessarily games unless they're going to be talking about
5504600	5506880	the gaming aspect of it, right?
5506880	5507880	Probably, yeah.
5507880	5509880	I hope it's something.
5509880	5510880	Yeah.
5510880	5513640	Well, I'm sure they've got lots of stuff in here to compete with.
5513640	5519200	I'm sure they're going to try to do something like X and A for the Zune.
5519200	5522680	It only makes sense because they'd be competing with Apple in that sense, because they're
5522680	5532840	going to have a marketplace that has applications and games similar to the Apple App Store.
5532840	5535600	Most importantly, however, will it blend?
5535600	5536600	That's the big question.
5536600	5537600	Always blends.
5537600	5538600	That's right.
5538600	5539600	All right.
5539600	5541080	Well, hey, Microsoft might be up to something else.
5541080	5545680	Apparently, there's some ads out there on Microsoft's careers site.
5545680	5549480	If you want to get a job with Microsoft, you can go to this website and look for possible
5549480	5550480	careers.
5550480	5552800	Apparently, one thing they are looking for right now, an engineer that will be working
5552800	5557640	on a game to support up to 300,000 players in real time.
5557640	5558640	No way.
5558640	5562000	Apparently, Microsoft is building an extremely high-performance system to extend console
5562000	5567640	games to the server in new ways, creating a completely new set of web services.
5567640	5570440	What's interesting about it, when I first looked at this, I was like, oh, big deal.
5570440	5572960	It's probably a computer game or something else.
5572960	5576440	But no, apparently, it is something that is going to be integrating into the console.
5576440	5580840	Could this be for some type of future NXC enhancement with all the avatars and what
5580840	5581840	have you?
5581840	5586240	What with all this now 1 versus 100 and all these live things, maybe they are looking
5586240	5587600	for something massive.
5587600	5588600	Who knows?
5588600	5592280	Or are they building some competition for PlayStation Home?
5592280	5594100	That could be.
5594100	5595600	Or is it a little bit of both?
5595600	5596600	Who knows?
5596600	5597600	Could be very interesting.
5597600	5600400	I don't really know why they would need to make competition for PlayStation Home.
5600400	5601400	I don't think...
5601400	5602400	I don't know.
5602400	5607760	Well, maybe they will do the things that Sony should have done with Home.
5607760	5610320	You know, Sony has kind of been a lot of big talk.
5610320	5613560	They've been talking about how you're going to launch games from within Home.
5613560	5616880	They've been talking about that trophy room where you're going to show off all your trophies.
5616880	5618880	Yet, we have yet to see all of that.
5618880	5621360	I mean, I guess they do have the launching of the games now built in.
5621360	5623780	But I got to be honest, it's a little clunky.
5623780	5627400	And how many people do you honestly know that are going to sit down at the Sony PlayStation
5627400	5631480	and go, okay, I'm going to go into Home to launch this game, right?
5631480	5635400	Nobody really does that, except maybe the one time to check out how it works.
5635400	5641940	You know, there isn't a lot of draw in Home to make that the place I start my gaming experience
5641940	5642980	right now.
5642980	5646880	Maybe Microsoft, if they build this into a future NXC, is going to make something like
5646880	5650120	Home the place to start your gaming experience.
5650120	5652680	Well, they're going to have to do a lot.
5652680	5660040	Well, Son of Dad in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com suggests XBLA announces Uno clusterfuck.
5660040	5662200	And Act Def says, I would play Uno clusterfuck.
5662200	5664040	I would check out Uno clusterfuck.
5664040	5665360	I would play Uno clusterfuck.
5665360	5667800	I could be with 300,000 people all at once.
5667800	5670960	Draw four, bitches.
5670960	5671960	I could see that.
5671960	5672960	Uno clusterfuck.
5672960	5675000	That'd be fun.
5675000	5676160	So we'll see what happens.
5676160	5679720	I doubt this will be an announcement at E3 this year anyway.
5679720	5680720	Maybe next year.
5680720	5681720	Who knows?
5681720	5682720	Oh, maybe.
5682720	5684720	Well, how about some other stuff though?
5684720	5685720	How about it?
5685720	5686720	How about betas?
5686720	5687720	Beta, beta, betas.
5687720	5690760	Aw, I thought you couldn't get those anymore.
5690760	5694040	It was all VHS now.
5694040	5695320	But I'm pumped.
5695320	5698760	This was me blinking at Rob.
5698760	5700880	There was the one versus 100 beta.
5700880	5703460	It was going on in Canada.
5703460	5705760	Or as some people say, Canadian.
5705760	5708200	I say Canada.
5708200	5712320	It is supposed to be though coming to America as of June 1st.
5712320	5714680	So if anyone cares, there you go.
5714680	5718560	Microsoft's bringing it home, beta style.
5718560	5721640	And all of us that are traveling to E3 won't get a chance to play this really unless we
5721640	5723040	bring our Xboxes with us.
5723040	5724040	So which I'm not.
5724040	5725880	I suppose I could try playing it.
5725880	5729400	Yeah, but weren't you asking me before the show, what the hell is this?
5729400	5732280	I've been hearing about it and honestly, I was like, I don't care.
5732280	5733800	But have you ever seen the game show?
5733800	5735240	No, I don't want TV.
5735240	5736240	Because it wasn't that great.
5736240	5737920	I mean, for one, it wasn't that great.
5737920	5742260	But if you heard a lot of good things about it, would you watch it maybe?
5742260	5743260	Check it out?
5743260	5744260	No.
5744260	5745260	You didn't have that hose with us.
5745260	5746260	He's not doing anything.
5746260	5747360	He just goes to E3.
5747360	5751520	But I mean, I think we can all agree the idea, this whole idea, despite the fact that the
5751520	5754860	game show itself might not have been that much fun to watch, to actually get to play
5754860	5757840	it on Xbox Live might be kind of cool.
5757840	5759720	I know I'm looking forward to it.
5759720	5762440	I didn't sneak into the Canada beta or anything.
5762440	5764080	I heard about all these people sneaking in.
5764080	5765660	I'm just like, big effing deal.
5765660	5766960	You can wait a couple weeks, right?
5766960	5769120	I would like to quote a line from Wayne's World.
5769120	5770120	Yes.
5770120	5771720	Monkeys might fly out of my butt.
5771720	5773680	So you don't see yourself playing it?
5773680	5774680	No.
5774680	5775680	Nah.
5775680	5779180	Redertainment says, am I only going to be able to play 1 versus 100 only at a set time
5779180	5780180	during the day?
5780180	5781180	Yeah.
5781180	5782560	I think that's how I understand it's set up, right?
5782560	5784560	Like, they have showtimes.
5784560	5788600	But I think it's not like they only let 101 people in.
5788600	5790680	No, it's people in the audience.
5790680	5793500	There's also the actual mob, which is 100 people.
5793500	5795320	And then there's the player.
5795320	5796520	Interesting.
5796520	5800720	So I would have thought maybe they have 30 different games, but they're all going at
5800720	5801960	the same time.
5801960	5803520	That way everybody gets to be in the mob.
5803520	5805160	But they're not going to do it that way, huh?
5805160	5807040	No, it doesn't quite work like that.
5807040	5809840	I think you have to register or something.
5809840	5811620	Well, that sucks.
5811620	5813720	What if I want to actually get to play the game?
5813720	5814720	Fat chance, right?
5814720	5815720	No!
5815720	5816720	You will not.
5816720	5819080	This is where the 300,000 comes in.
5819080	5823600	Son of Dad says, only good thing about 1 versus 100 is Bob Saget, who will not be a part of
5823600	5824600	this.
5824600	5827920	Black Wolf is correcting us, saying no registration.
5827920	5832520	The reason there's a showtime is because there's a live host who conducts interviews.
5832520	5833520	That's kind of cool.
5833520	5834520	Screw the live host.
5834520	5835520	We don't need a live host.
5835520	5836520	Well, I mean, no.
5836520	5837520	I like the idea of a live host.
5837520	5838520	I just kind of thought...
5838520	5839520	I don't know.
5839520	5840520	I thought...
5840520	5841520	Just outsource it to India.
5841520	5842520	...to a conference.
5842520	5843520	Oh, God.
5843520	5844520	So we can have it 24 hours.
5844520	5845520	We can do a match.
5845520	5846520	Wow.
5846520	5850160	I don't know who you are anymore.
5850160	5854440	But I would have thought maybe there'd be like 30 games going on at once.
5854440	5858440	And Black Wolf says they are going to have other games during the week where you are
5858440	5861400	in an automated game as you play those.
5861400	5862400	So OK.
5862400	5866160	So they'll have like their big live event and then some other games throughout the week.
5866160	5867160	I don't know.
5867160	5869380	I'm curious to see how this all comes together.
5869380	5872800	That still earns me the who cares award of the week.
5872800	5873800	I'd care.
5873800	5874800	I'm a big fan of game shows.
5874800	5875800	You know what?
5875800	5876800	I want to check this out.
5876800	5877800	I would be all over what?
5877800	5878920	Prime Time Survivor.
5878920	5882880	I would be all over that game, tooth and nail, playing Prime Time Survivor.
5882880	5883880	I hope that's the next game.
5883880	5885960	Or was it the Amazing Race?
5885960	5886960	Any of those games.
5886960	5889880	Although I don't know how you play the Amazing Race on Xbox.
5889880	5890880	I don't think that would work.
5890880	5891880	Tap A to run.
5891880	5893880	Tap A to be amazing.
5893880	5895880	All right.
5895880	5896880	Anyhow.
5896880	5903960	Well, you know, 1 versus 100 still weighs off from actually coming out.
5903960	5908520	But Sims 3, that's on its way out later this week.
5908520	5912280	And already, you know, people have been pirating the hell out of it.
5912280	5917440	And as with any Sims game, it's only traditional that you get an uncensored patch.
5917440	5918760	And that's what they've done.
5918760	5919760	Boobs.
5919760	5920760	Boobs patch.
5920760	5924240	Before the game has been released, they have taken away the blur.
5924240	5928840	So now you can see the nipolous, you know, women without their genitalia.
5928840	5931200	Well, you know they're going to make new skins, too.
5931200	5932200	Exactly.
5932200	5933480	That is step 2.
5933480	5934480	And then problem.
5934480	5935840	Is that a new verb you just invented?
5935840	5936840	Nipolous?
5936840	5937840	The nip...
5937840	5938840	The most...
5938840	5939840	Nipolous.
5939840	5940840	The nipolous...
5940840	5941840	The most nipolous women.
5941840	5942840	Oh, nipolous.
5942840	5943840	Oh, nipolous.
5943840	5944840	Very Barbie-like.
5944840	5945840	Oh, nipolous.
5945840	5946840	Oh, I'm sorry.
5946840	5947840	I thought you were...
5947840	5948840	I thought you were using it as...
5948840	5949840	No, not as...
5949840	5950840	To describe somebody.
5950840	5951840	She was quite nipply.
5951840	5955160	That actually is the word that people use, Rob.
5955160	5956680	Oh, I guess that's true.
5956680	5957680	But not to...
5957680	5962240	And besides, I would not be able to, you know, take credit for that phrase.
5962240	5967800	I believe Chevy Chase said it a long time ago in Christmas Vacation.
5967800	5969080	It's a bit nipply outside.
5969080	5970080	Alright, whatever.
5970080	5971080	Fine.
5971080	5972080	That's true.
5972080	5980520	So, and then, besides that, The Sims 3, apparently, within the first four days of its online debut,
5980520	5984600	it had been downloaded 180,000 times.
5984600	5993280	And apparently they claim that you are playing a non-final unauthorized copy of The Sims
5993280	5994280	3.
5994280	5995280	Which is crap.
5995280	5996280	Which...
5996280	6000440	Yes, that is absolute crap, because I can tell you right now, retailers have had this
6000440	6003600	game for two weeks now, so...
6003600	6009160	It's absolute crap, and what they mean by non-final is that you haven't registered it
6009160	6013680	so you can't download the other town they have available, Riverview.
6013680	6020520	And also you get 1,000 sim points that you can buy virtual objects with.
6020520	6024440	But you know what, it's only a matter of time before that gets leaked too, so just give
6024440	6026680	it time.
6026680	6029640	But I bet there's a lot of people that still want to buy the real deal.
6029640	6033560	Mark Sakras expressed her interest in just buying it for real.
6033560	6036440	Yeah, because you're a Sims fan and you support the developers.
6036440	6041760	I learned my lesson with buying Spore, so I will not buy The Sims 3.
6041760	6048120	I probably won't end up playing The Sims 3 either, but yes, Spore will not get any more
6048120	6049120	of my money.
6049120	6051800	I don't know, I feel like there's so many other games for me to play right now, I don't
6051800	6055560	know if I can get sucked into The Sims 3, but I'll watch Jamie play it, and if it looks
6055560	6056560	interesting, I'll buy it.
6056560	6062000	I only want to kill naked Sims in this game, so you know, I can't see myself actually spending
6062000	6066240	money and time to play this game, because all I'm going to do is download the uncensored
6066240	6070520	patch, download the new skins that make naked Sims, because that's funny for some reason.
6070520	6072280	Naked Sim Party, Naked Sim Death Party.
6072280	6073280	I have naked Sims.
6073280	6077760	And you know, the other costumes and skins that they have, like the naked Joker sim,
6077760	6085080	and you know, just ridiculous stuff, and then just kill them all in really interesting ways.
6085080	6088840	And that's how I'll spend an evening, and then we're done.
6088840	6090240	Then I don't play it ever again.
6090240	6093760	That's what happens in The Sims, and then every now and then I'll go back to it, reinstall
6093760	6097520	it, and do it all over again, and then we're done.
6097520	6102520	So I really don't see a point in me buying this full retail game for this.
6102520	6106280	I don't care about the other town, I don't need another town to visit to kill The Sims
6106280	6107480	in this way.
6107480	6108480	It's just...
6108480	6110080	You don't want to kill The Sims in the other town?
6110080	6114120	I guess I could, why not, you know, but it's...
6114120	6115120	I just don't really care.
6115120	6118560	Playing Sims right now.
6118560	6119560	And totally enjoying it.
6119560	6124160	Darksharkar, have you ever gone on the Naked Death Spree in The Sims?
6124160	6126960	No, not yet, because I told you I'm too busy building houses.
6126960	6130280	I was trying to make a haunted house once, and there was another time that the mailman
6130280	6135360	came and then I trapped them with a mote, and that was funny too because they couldn't
6135360	6141360	figure out how to leave, and then I killed the mail person by starving them to death.
6141360	6146380	I would love to see a real absurd Sims-type game.
6146380	6148640	Maybe this game exists somewhere, someone will have to tell me.
6148640	6155240	Like a very absurd Sims-type game or an add-on that is all about the horrific death of your
6155240	6156240	Sims.
6156240	6157240	Why not?
6157240	6158240	They had...
6158240	6159480	I don't know if you remember this.
6159480	6165280	They had a freeware game that someone made called Lammers, and it was a spin-off of Lemmings,
6165280	6170480	where you had a gun and different weapons, and you shot the Lemmings as they ran across
6170480	6174720	the street, and they would do like, you know, all the stuff would be AI-driven so they would
6174720	6178480	be doing the builders and that kind of stuff, but no, you couldn't let them get to the home
6178480	6180160	that you had to kill them.
6180160	6181640	I would play that.
6181640	6182640	It was awesome.
6182640	6187120	I bet it's online somewhere, just look up Lammers, the freeware Lemmings spin-off.
6187120	6188680	I hate Lemmings.
6188680	6191880	Yeah, Lemmings was awesome like ten years ago, but...
6191880	6193380	Lemmings reminds me of people I know.
6193380	6199040	But now like Lemmings, they re-released it for the PSP and the Playstation 3, like it's
6199040	6202000	popular all over again or something, I don't know.
6202000	6203000	I can't talk.
6203000	6207960	I had a fansite for drawings I would do, just because apparently the only thing I could
6207960	6209520	draw at one time was Lemmings.
6209520	6216020	Well, maybe someday something that can be cool again is Sonic, and Sonic, of course,
6216020	6219440	you know, the last few Sonic games they've put out have been, well, let's just say not
6219440	6221000	as great as the old ones.
6221000	6223840	Well, who remembers Sonic R?
6223840	6225160	I love Sonic R!
6225160	6226160	Oh my god!
6226160	6227480	No, no, no, no, no, no.
6227480	6229120	You don't even understand, okay?
6229120	6230760	I'm sure it was one of your games of the week before.
6230760	6235360	Yeah, actually, I think it has been, but I was so, the one thing I was super mad about
6235360	6239540	Vista is that I couldn't play Sonic R unless I play in compatibility mode, then it fucks
6239540	6240720	up my resolution.
6240720	6245880	Well, the bad news is, this story is not about a Sonic R2 or a Sonic R revival, sorry.
6245880	6247480	Ugh, why'd you do that to me for?
6247480	6252200	But the good news is, they are talking about a new Sonic racing game.
6252200	6255680	It's called Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.
6255680	6260080	Apparently it will be Sonic versus Super Monkey Ball in his little ball.
6260080	6266280	Samba De Amigo's monkey guy that has the maracas are all going to be in this Sonic racing game.
6266280	6269120	However, now they're in vehicles.
6269120	6270560	What does this game sound like to you?
6270560	6271560	No!
6271560	6272560	They have to run!
6272560	6273560	What does this game sound like to you?
6273560	6274560	They have to run!
6274560	6276360	Could they, are they going to be in carts by chance?
6276360	6278040	Rob, don't do this to me.
6278040	6281280	Maybe instead of shells they'll throw rings, I don't call it a hunch.
6281280	6282760	Rob, don't do this to me!
6282760	6285800	They actually had a Game Gear game that was in carts.
6285800	6290400	Well, now to be fair, I am joking a little bit, this game is not going to be all carts.
6290400	6295020	There's going to be planes and sports cars and bananas.
6295020	6296020	That's right, bananas.
6296020	6300280	Hey, this game is coming out on the Playstation 3, Xbox 360.
6300280	6301640	Did you just say Sonic Butt Monkeys?
6301640	6303880	No, Sonic Plus Monkeys.
6303880	6304880	That's what the game is.
6304880	6305880	And the DS in 2010.
6305880	6308680	I wonder if Ooh La La will be in it.
6308680	6310960	I swear you said Sonic Butt Monkeys.
6310960	6312920	Instant purchase of Ooh La La's in it.
6312920	6318800	Well, remember, she was in Sega Superstar Tennis, I believe, so it very well...
6318800	6323840	I fucking hate that Sega keeps teasing Ooh La La in front of us, though, like, remember
6323840	6325440	Space Channel 5?
6325440	6327520	Too bad you're never going to see another one!
6327520	6332840	I wonder if we're going to have Ooh La La's in it if Space Michael will be in it.
6332840	6333920	Nope.
6333920	6334920	Don't hold your breath.
6334920	6339880	I like Space Michael, it's the only cool incarnation he's had since, you know, Thriller, when he
6339880	6342120	was a zombie.
6342120	6343120	Leo Shen agrees with me.
6343120	6345520	I will only buy this game if Ooh La La is a guest again.
6345520	6346520	She was in Riders.
6346520	6348800	There you go.
6348800	6350640	So we'll see more about this game.
6350640	6351640	Who knows?
6351640	6352640	Maybe something at E3?
6352640	6353640	Question mark?
6353640	6354640	We will see.
6354640	6357520	Apparently this game is out in 2010, so they got to show it at some point.
6357520	6359240	Let's move on to some more gaming news in the meantime.
6359240	6363080	This is happy, happy, happy news, and I wonder if my hubby knows about it, which he probably
6363080	6364600	does.
6364600	6369840	Sega is going to be doing downloadable vintage games on Xbox Live Arcade.
6369840	6377120	Starting off with the, one of the pinnacle of video games, Gunstar Heroes, on June 10th,
6377120	6385200	and of course the next day it will be out on PlayStation Network, is actually, that's
6385200	6389040	the only one that's supposed to be coming out on PlayStation Network so far, but there
6389040	6395600	were seven other titles announced for Xbox Live Arcade, which I think that I've already
6395600	6402640	covered this, Arcade Shinobi, Comic Zone, Altered Beast, Sonic 3, Phantasy Star 2, Sonic
6402640	6406880	& Knuckles, and Gunstar Heroes.
6406880	6409480	Great except for the fact that I already own that Sega collection.
6409480	6415800	Do you know how many copies of Gunstar Heroes we have and Gunstar Super Heroes and all versions
6415800	6416800	of Gunstar Heroes?
6416800	6420400	And let me guess, this will be one more because you need the achievements, right?
6420400	6421400	It's Dan.
6421400	6422400	He'll get it.
6422400	6423400	He'll get it.
6423400	6424400	I know he'll get it.
6424400	6428680	Um, Loki found that clip of Lamer's on YouTube that we were talking about earlier.
6428680	6431360	I think I've played that game before.
6431360	6432760	I think I've played it before.
6432760	6435760	It looked very familiar to me, but yeah, can you link that in chat?
6435760	6439220	I know this does no good for our podcast listeners, but can you at least link it in chat so they
6439220	6440840	can kind of see what you're looking at here?
6440840	6442600	I just saw the best mashup game, Rob.
6442600	6443600	What's that?
6443600	6446560	Mashup game of the week, Worms and Lemmings.
6446560	6450200	Wait, is this a real game or something you want to exist?
6450200	6453740	I'm gonna start my mashup game of the week.
6453740	6454740	That's a lot.
6454740	6455740	Mashup game.
6455740	6456740	All right.
6456740	6457800	It is Worms and Lemmings.
6457800	6460680	Imagine your Lemmings are running around and you blow them up with the...
6460680	6461680	That's what this is.
6461680	6462680	Look at this.
6462680	6463680	Well, no.
6463680	6469440	You actually, they wage war on each other and your Lemmings are your innocent bystanders.
6469440	6471080	I remember an old-ass PC game.
6471080	6472920	I'm going on a tangent here, but I don't care.
6472920	6474840	I remember an old-ass PC game.
6474840	6476920	I think it was called Global Thermonuclear War.
6476920	6477920	Yeah!
6477920	6478920	Did you ever play that game?
6478920	6479920	A long time ago.
6479920	6482080	And it was all about nuking other countries.
6482080	6485040	And they had very- Would you like to play a game?
6485040	6488480	Very caricatured world leaders in this.
6488480	6489480	And it was just about nuking other countries.
6489480	6494600	Was it a game that came from War Games?
6494600	6496080	The movie War Games?
6496080	6497080	It might have.
6497080	6499880	The thing was, let's play Global Thermonuclear War.
6499880	6503480	Yeah, maybe it was that, but it came out much later than the movie was out.
6503480	6505420	I remember it was on VGA and all that.
6505420	6510540	They have this game available for download in the DOS museum at LinkedIn chat.
6510540	6511540	Very nice.
6511540	6513960	So, you can check that out, dosmuseum.com.
6513960	6516840	Just look for lammers.
6516840	6519000	And yes, you just gun down people.
6519000	6522360	That's all you do.
6522360	6525840	Somewhere right now in the world, a phone call is being made from an angry parental
6525840	6528840	association.
6528840	6530480	Some folks in chat remember the game, too.
6530480	6532480	Reddertainment says they're in chat.
6532480	6533480	Chat.orangetonsradio.com.
6533480	6534480	I remember playing this game.
6534480	6537320	See, that's what- When I saw the YouTube, then I was like, oh yeah, I have played this
6537320	6538320	before.
6538320	6539320	Anyhow, more news.
6539320	6540320	Sorry, Logie.
6540320	6546520	So, there's a possibility, according to Volition, that they may port Saints Row or Red Faction
6546520	6548280	to the Wii.
6548280	6550160	And that's pretty awesome.
6550160	6555480	I guess during the Red Faction Gorilla launch event in New York, someone apparently asked
6555480	6557560	them about that.
6557560	6564840	And they said, though THQ may do Wii versions of our games, in the future Volition won't
6564840	6565840	be doing them.
6565840	6567800	At least not for the next year or so.
6567800	6572720	So they may have another party or another company port them over.
6572720	6573720	I don't know.
6573720	6576440	I think Saints Row on the Wii is pretty awesome.
6576440	6577440	Why is that?
6577440	6580800	Even though graphically it would probably have to be scaled down, but what is it?
6580800	6582040	With the motion control and everything?
6582040	6583040	Or what is it about?
6583040	6584040	Yeah, it'd just be murdering things.
6584040	6587840	I mean, they actually- Yeah, but wasn't that what Manhunt 2 was supposed to be, and look
6587840	6588840	how that turned out.
6588840	6592720	Yeah, but there's other games that are like that that are fun, like Scarface.
6592720	6595960	Scarface was pretty fun, and it was kind of the same type of game.
6595960	6599560	Just Saints Row is really over the top.
6599560	6604240	But yeah, I would see a Saints Row 3.
6604240	6606360	Saints Row is kind of one of those overlooked type of games.
6606360	6607360	How did the second one sell?
6607360	6608360	Do you know?
6608360	6609360	Not very well.
6609360	6610360	Ugh.
6610360	6611360	Yeah, it's too bad.
6611360	6613760	I'm actually planning on picking up the other expansion pack.
6613760	6617680	I still haven't played the last expansion pack that they had come out.
6617680	6621640	I've been too busy with other things, but I do want to go back to it, because it's pretty
6621640	6622640	fun.
6622640	6625640	I also have Left 4 Dead I haven't played yet, and Fallout 3.
6625640	6627560	All these games that are just sitting waiting.
6627560	6630360	Oh, and Killzone 2 and Resistance 2.
6630360	6632280	It's too much.
6632280	6637440	All right, well, moving on with some more gaming news.
6637440	6640800	Another series that seems to be making a comeback, Trauma Team.
6640800	6643720	This is coming out from Atlus, is putting this out on the Wii.
6643720	6647660	And yes, this does appear to be in the same vein as Trauma Center and all that.
6647660	6651480	This is now Trauma Team is the game that's going to be coming out on the Wii.
6651480	6656200	It's going to be gameplay six different medical fields, so you're not just necessarily a doctor
6656200	6657200	now.
6657200	6661960	You're going to be a general surgeon, diagnostician, orthopedic surgeon, endoscope technician.
6661960	6663180	Oh, great.
6663180	6665960	You can do colonoscopies in a video game now.
6665960	6667360	Now I've heard everything.
6667360	6669720	Medical examiner and EMT.
6669720	6670720	Very interesting.
6670720	6673560	Dude that mops up hospital rooms.
6673560	6677320	I just, I am shocked, because you know what an endoscopy is.
6677320	6678320	Yes, I do know it.
6678320	6680200	That's where they put a tube in your body somewhere.
6680200	6684640	So like, either you're going to be doing examinations down the mouth and throat, which I guess is
6684640	6688520	probably likely, or up a butt.
6688520	6692260	This could be very interesting gaming.
6692260	6697000	Is Trauma Team about me when I play it, and not the victims in the game?
6697000	6699400	It'd be even better if you could do it.
6699400	6701840	Will it be Katie Couric showing it live on TV?
6701840	6705800	Do you have multiple, now do they have two player in the last game?
6705800	6707160	I think they did, yes.
6707160	6711040	Because they should have two player in this, except you would never want to play with me,
6711040	6716160	because I'd be like, let's play tic-tac-toe on his colon, you know?
6716160	6719960	But it looks like, look at this, you're like pounding on a guy's chest in this screenshot
6719960	6721120	here, like you're doing all these-
6721120	6723120	God damn it, live!
6723120	6725120	Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor.
6725120	6731040	That would be awesome if they had like some sort of vocal recognition software or something
6731040	6732040	in there.
6732040	6735400	It's like karaoke revolution, so you gotta yell like, you know, a phrase or something.
6735400	6739200	Whoa, whoa, whoa, look at this picture here, I gotta link this in chat, look at this.
6739200	6743800	Some person lifting up their shirt, exposing their bra while the doctor's operating on
6743800	6744800	them.
6744800	6748520	This is like little kids playing doctor, realized it's a video game.
6748520	6749920	It's not a mastectomy.
6749920	6750920	Wow.
6750920	6755480	Wow, we're looking at Grey's Anatomy the game now.
6755480	6756480	Apparently.
6756480	6757480	My gosh.
6757480	6759360	Grey's Anatomy the game sucks.
6759360	6765480	Tiger Claw in chat says, the tagline for the game would be, explore Uranus.
6765480	6772160	Okay, that was probably one of the single most beautiful things I've ever heard from
6772160	6774200	a listener, ever.
6774200	6779120	Boldly go, where no man has gone before.
6779120	6783840	You know what, at E3, I'm gonna make it a point to find this game, and when they tell
6783840	6787760	me that you can be an endoscopy technician, I'm gonna say it's so like you can do a colonoscopy
6787760	6788760	in the game.
6788760	6789760	Do it.
6789760	6790760	Oh my god, do it.
6790760	6791760	I will do it.
6791760	6792760	I promise you.
6792760	6793760	You have to do it.
6793760	6794760	I promise the listeners.
6794760	6799640	I will ask if we get colonoscopies, and when they tell me no, I'm gonna ask why not.
6799640	6803280	Do we have an option of leaving a sponge behind?
6803280	6805760	Ah, crap.
6805760	6812400	Like you should have to count the sponges and stuff, make sure that they're all there,
6812400	6816160	and then you don't, and then later on, you know, it flashes to a cut scene where the
6816160	6820320	guy's like feeling, you know, like chest pains and stuff like that.
6820320	6822720	I can see the scenario now, alright.
6822720	6823720	Scenario one.
6823720	6824720	Okay, here it is.
6824720	6829840	You've got the diagnostician is playing with the endoscopy, like your team here, so okay,
6829840	6834980	this patient has come in and is complaining of pains, and he's feeling some little tapping
6834980	6845280	pains in his rear end, and him and his partner were playing with gerbils a little while ago.
6845280	6847200	You gotta diagnose and treat.
6847200	6851200	So I've got gerbils up his butt.
6851200	6852200	Let's operate.
6852200	6854500	Do we get to hear the Lemmy Winks song at that time?
6854500	6857040	This could be the most beautiful video game of all time.
6857040	6859680	This has so much potential.
6859680	6861100	So much potential.
6861100	6866880	And then when they die on the operating table, then we have the spinoff, you know, the Phoenix
6866880	6870200	Rite or the Ace Attorney series, you know.
6870200	6871200	The legend is not good.
6871200	6872200	Medical malpractice.
6872200	6875400	Ace Attorney.
6875400	6876520	The legend is not good.
6876520	6877900	We are so mature tonight.
6877900	6882240	The legend is not good in chat says, I seriously want to leave a junior mint on the patient
6882240	6884200	before I stitch him up.
6884200	6885200	What?
6885200	6886720	So your fart starts smelling minty?
6886720	6888200	No, didn't you see that?
6888200	6889200	No, what?
6889200	6890200	No.
6890200	6891200	It's from Seinfeld.
6891200	6892200	It's they, they had a junior mint.
6892200	6897960	They're watching a operation and they drop a junior mint and it gets, it gets into his
6897960	6898960	body.
6898960	6902920	It makes him really sick, I guess.
6902920	6905920	What would happen if you, if you really left a junior mint in someone's body?
6905920	6906920	It would suck.
6906920	6908440	You would not be happy.
6908440	6909440	That's all.
6909440	6910440	You would not be happy.
6910440	6912240	All right.
6912240	6919280	This is getting way too, uh, Frisbee is mentioning the sequel Morg Center.
6919280	6925560	Death is upon us, dude, God, I love our chatters.
6925560	6927240	The most fantastic name ever.
6927240	6928880	I love our chatters so much.
6928880	6929880	All right.
6929880	6931320	Look, uh, we love the listeners so much.
6931320	6932960	Let's do a segment dedicated to them.
6932960	6936640	It's, yes, it's why they hate.
6936640	6941320	You've just lavished praise upon our listeners for their genius comments tonight, dark Sakura.
6941320	6944840	And now I, you know what segment I'm getting to and you're complaining, I'm sorry to take
6944840	6949760	you away from house building, but it is that time where we open up the mailbag and read
6949760	6955320	your emails at mailbag at orange launch reader.com and see what you guys have to say.
6955320	6957840	By the way, Marissa Congusto, you could die.
6957840	6959360	You would get a terrible infection.
6959360	6964080	That's what would happen with the junior men to see, you know, see chat room can answer
6964080	6965440	the questions that we can sometimes.
6965440	6966440	All right.
6966440	6969280	Dark Sakura, open up the old email bag at mailbag at orange launch reader.com.
6969280	6973680	You're gonna have to put your house building away and uh, all right.
6973680	6975720	And uh, look at this, Rob.
6975720	6976720	Look at this.
6976720	6977720	Oh, she's ready to go.
6977720	6978720	All right.
6978720	6979720	Okay.
6979720	6980720	Email number one.
6980720	6981720	Dear OLR.
6981720	6987840	Dear Rob, I think you should stop giving Jamie a hard time and go eat a junior man.
6987840	6993160	Love, uh, member dark Sakura.
6993160	6994160	One.
6994160	6995160	Okay.
6995160	6998560	First one is cheeseburger.
6998560	7004440	Hey guys, last week I was listening live on my PSP, so cool and was not in the chat room.
7004440	7008120	The thing I wanted to chime in was the discussion of arcade cabinets.
7008120	7011040	I don't remember who said they would kill for an original star Wars arcade machine,
7011040	7014320	but I would so kill for an original star Wars arcade machine.
7014320	7019520	I'm 15, so obviously didn't grow up in the eighties, but I have always thought, and everyone
7019520	7022320	tells me that I was born in the wrong decade.
7022320	7024800	I would give anything to have grown up in the eighties.
7024800	7025800	No Reagan.
7025800	7026800	That's all.
7026800	7030920	Um, I roam eBay for countless hours for classic video games.
7030920	7036700	I watch all of the AVGN videos and well, the angry video game nerd to translate.
7036700	7040240	And while this email is getting too long, my longest OLR email so far, I'm going to
7040240	7041240	shut up.
7041240	7042240	PS sky.
7042240	7046560	I mess around with iPod custom firmware and would like to make an OLR custom firmware
7046560	7047560	for iPod.
7047560	7052640	So could you send me or link me to some OLR picks to work with?
7052640	7055100	I will totally forget that request.
7055100	7059360	So send me a message to my personal email at rob at orange and Andre.com and I will
7059360	7060920	be happy to do that.
7060920	7061920	Okay.
7061920	7067880	Also, I do want to commend our different cheeseburger for vastly improving and spelling and grammar.
7067880	7074560	So the most improved award you, you win a shiny, shiny gold star you seriously.
7074560	7075560	You win.
7075560	7077840	It's probably one of the most legible emails I've received from cheeseburger.
7077840	7078840	Here you go.
7078840	7079960	Have a junior mint.
7079960	7083600	You get a golden junior mint, which you don't want to know why it's cold.
7083600	7086080	Next email.
7086080	7087080	This is from alpha.
7087080	7088840	Can anagram it's your OLR.
7088840	7089840	This is a quick lesson.
7089840	7090840	The email.
7090840	7091840	Well, it's a lot longer than I thought it would be.
7091840	7096520	Actually a plan on getting a PSP go, but I'm keeping my PSP 2000, which has the earliest
7096520	7099560	motherboard and firmware version 3.90.
7099560	7104640	The one I had to fix and asked y'all's advice, god I miss people saying that, advice on removing
7104640	7109240	that damned stripped screw, which I finally got out.
7109240	7114040	I preordered a game that comes out in a month that is on UMD, I'm importing slash paying
7114040	7119040	for this one since it comes with a physical preorder bonus that you can't pirate.
7119040	7122820	But I have just realized that I haven't bought any recent PSP games that require a firmware
7122820	7127840	update, since my PSP's d-pad was previously broken for the longest time until recently.
7127840	7131460	And this game probably will have a firmware update on it that will want to be installed
7131460	7132760	before the game can be played.
7132760	7138840	The thing is, with multiple commas, is that I still want to hack this PSP and play the
7138840	7143080	game without updating, but I have no Pandora battery or magic memory stick.
7143080	7148360	Do y'all know anyone or any place that is reputable and cheap or free to get either
7148360	7149360	of these items from?
7149360	7154360	I probably can make the memory stick thing, not sure about the battery part.
7154360	7160600	You can make the battery, but you need to have another PSP to do that.
7160600	7161600	Another PSP.
7161600	7162600	So borrow a friend's?
7162600	7165280	Another PSP with a custom firmware, and then there's a program that you can run to make
7165280	7166480	the battery.
7166480	7170120	And then to make a battery for a 2000 is a pain in the ass.
7170120	7172600	Because you have to do some extra steps.
7172600	7175280	But it's not that hard, I did it, I still have one.
7175280	7179280	Oh, I still have one.
7179280	7184040	Also, if we're ready then for the conclusion of the email that's answered the question.
7184040	7187080	This email has been brought to you by Yoshi's Island, home of the never-ending Crying Baby
7187080	7188080	Marios.
7188080	7189080	Waaa!
7189080	7190800	God, I hated Toys R Us when that thing was there.
7190800	7191800	Oh man.
7191800	7192800	I used to play that demo.
7192800	7194000	Did you use to work at Toys R Us?
7194000	7199040	No, I just used to frequent Toys R Us when they had toys in there, now that it's Baby
7199040	7202160	RS slash Toys R Us.
7202160	7205680	I have to say though, touch fuzzy, get dizzy, one of the greatest stages in all of video
7205680	7206680	gaming.
7206680	7211440	Yes, I didn't notice the USB port or spot-to-access battery on the PSP Go pictures, comma comma
7211440	7212440	comma.
7212440	7213440	Hmm.
7213440	7216720	Well, then again, E3 hasn't happened yet, so I suppose it is a secret to everybody.
7216720	7221400	PPS, I am probably going to grammar hell, ain't I?
7221400	7225400	P-P-P-S, To Dark Sakura, comma comma comma heart.
7225400	7228840	I know you did that on purpose.
7228840	7229840	K.
7229840	7230840	Whatever.
7230840	7231840	Next email.
7231840	7233640	Dun dun dun.
7233640	7234920	I think this is from Act Deaf.
7234920	7235920	Yeah, it is.
7235920	7239400	Hi, OLR crew, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Act Deaf.
7239400	7243520	I'm writing today to ask a couple of questions and to fill some space up in the old mailbag.
7243520	7244920	I hope you can answer them.
7244920	7249400	I'm probably getting a PSP soon, and yeah, I know the PSP Go is coming and all that stuff,
7249400	7251000	but I personally think the design sucks.
7251000	7252000	Amen!
7252000	7254200	Oh my god, it looks like a cell phone.
7254200	7258640	Of course, one of my immediate purchases is Rock Band Unplugged, and I already have pretty
7258640	7261600	Can I Be the Hero and Pump It Up Portable.
7261600	7266040	My question is what other games should I look out for, especially cheap ones since my budget
7266040	7267600	isn't that big right now.
7267600	7270960	Any type of game except SRPGs are good.
7270960	7273720	Potapon 2 and Loco Roko, two, both 20 bucks.
7273720	7274720	Loco Roko.
7274720	7277980	Luminous is one of the greatest puzzle games you'll ever play, and the PSP is the platform
7277980	7280760	to play it on, especially if you can find Luminous 2.
7280760	7285320	The sequel was really effing good and unfortunately didn't quite have that same magic and momentum
7285320	7289640	of its first game, although the first game does have Shining and some really good tracks.
7289640	7293080	Luminous 2, don't overlook it, it's a great little puzzler game.
7293080	7295200	If you can find it on the cheap, definitely pick that up.
7295200	7298640	And the Grand Theft Auto games are pretty good too.
7298640	7304080	Also since you're going to be at E3, I would like to ask you to look for any info on a
7304080	7306920	possible American release of Space Invaders Extreme 2.
7306920	7310880	I love the first game and have the Xbox Live Arcade version, I would love to have a localized
7310880	7313560	version of it instead of importing it.
7313560	7317680	I also want to follow up on a call of mine from a few weeks back in the Latin America
7317680	7321360	release of Patapon 2, since it's download only in the States.
7321360	7325160	I searched in some stores here in Mexico a few days ago and found they were selling Patapon
7325160	7330240	2, and surprisingly it was on UMD, no download copies here apparently.
7330240	7334320	Thank god Sony did the right thing here and released it on physical media, it would have
7334320	7338800	been a pain in the ass just to download the thing from the PSN store, though of course
7338800	7342040	the game costs double the price in the US.
7342040	7345680	Well those are my questions for now, I wish you a good trip to E3 Skyloki and I hope you
7345680	7350200	have a great time there, PS bring us some E3 swag.
7350200	7351760	We just might.
7351760	7359080	Um, okay, I guess this is Dan Shadow, what's your favorite kind of flour, mine's chocolate.
7359080	7360080	What?!
7360080	7361080	Whatever.
7361080	7363200	Uh, I like tuna.
7363200	7364760	Mine's tuna.
7364760	7367960	Type of, wait what, flour?
7367960	7368960	Flour?
7368960	7369960	Flour?
7369960	7371120	The game on Playstation 3.
7371120	7373120	I don't know.
7373120	7374120	Baking.
7374120	7376720	That's F-L-O-W-E-R.
7376720	7378600	You didn't say that.
7378600	7380340	I said flower, not flower.
7380340	7382760	You know what, go stuff a junior mint.
7382760	7384600	Where the sun don't shine.
7384600	7385600	How about the last email?
7385600	7386600	A virgin's.
7386600	7387600	Hello?
7387600	7393600	I see what you did there, okay.
7393600	7397240	You made a dumb email pretty good, Loki, good job.
7397240	7398240	Okay.
7398240	7402080	Hello NOLA Orange Lounge Radio Crew, this is Blue Swim from the NOLA Army's Twitter
7402080	7403080	Division.
7403080	7408360	Over the Memorial Day weekend last week, my beloved cat of 13 years, Goldie, took ill.
7408360	7411920	After her condition worsened, I had to do the toughest thing I've ever done and had
7411920	7412920	her put to sleep.
7412920	7413920	Aww.
7413920	7415920	Her passing was the first time I've cried since I was a kid.
7415920	7417280	What a downer.
7417280	7418720	Why did you have to end with this one?
7418720	7419720	This is sad.
7419720	7421060	I'm so sorry to hear about that.
7421060	7422400	It's never easy to lose a pet.
7422400	7423400	It's like losing a baby.
7423400	7425000	My kitty died.
7425000	7427600	It's sad, now I'm going to be in a bad mood the rest of the night.
7427600	7428960	Oh, let me finish reading the email.
7428960	7429960	Fine.
7429960	7430960	Stop being a baby.
7430960	7434280	It wasn't uncommon for her to walk over and plop herself down on my lap while I was in
7434280	7435920	the middle of playing a game.
7435920	7438600	She'd do it even while I was playing the drums and rock band.
7438600	7441640	It's actually one of my favorite gaming memories, which leads to my question for this email.
7441640	7442640	This is so sad.
7442640	7448100	Do you guys have any gaming related memories involving a pet or pets that you've had?
7448100	7452400	Thank you for doing OLR all this time, keep doing what you're doing, Blue Swim.
7452400	7456760	My old cat, Madeline, really the only cat I had because I haven't had one in many years.
7456760	7458480	She passed away several years ago.
7458480	7461000	She was actually named after the actress, Madeline Kahn.
7461000	7462000	That's fantastic.
7462000	7463000	Yeah, who else?
7463000	7466600	Well, because Clue was my favorite movie growing up, so when we got my cat, I named my cat
7466600	7471120	after Madeline Kahn because, of course, Mrs. White was one of the best characters in that
7471120	7472120	movie.
7472120	7475480	Anyhow, my cat would actually, while I was playing video games, my cat liked to hang
7475480	7476480	out.
7476480	7479340	Shermie's not on her box, I can tell you that.
7479340	7482800	My cat liked to hang out in this patio room that we had.
7482800	7486660	We had an indoor patio and that was basically the cat's room.
7486660	7489800	My mom didn't like the cat in the house because it would get fur everywhere, but the cat basically
7489800	7490800	had her own room.
7490800	7493680	But we had a glass door leading to this indoor patio.
7493680	7496900	So when I would play video games, I remember my cat would run up and just kind of stare
7496900	7498840	through the door at the TV.
7498840	7502640	But we all know cats don't really see the same images we do.
7502640	7503640	Something about the TV.
7503640	7504640	I don't know.
7504640	7507520	But when I was a young kid, I used to think, oh, she loves watching me play video games.
7507520	7511240	So I remember that with my cat.
7511240	7515640	Do you have a pet-related story, Logie?
7515640	7520560	My cat Chase is the Wii pointer on the screen.
7520560	7524880	When Animal Crossing would come, when we'd play Animal Crossing, and the little bus logo
7524880	7528600	thing would pop up on the screen, she'd get down the bottom of the TV and start pawing
7528600	7530560	at it.
7530560	7537280	When I got DDR Second Mix, this was actually not too long after I first got Shermie, so
7537280	7540280	she was probably about two years old at the time.
7540280	7547040	She used to hit the analog button on the Dreamcast pads and start the game for me or put me in
7547040	7548040	another.
7548040	7549040	You know, put me in SSR.
7549040	7552480	I'd be like, damn it, I'm not that good yet.
7552480	7560920	And then she would actually every so often she'd enjoy watching the fish on the Sega
7560920	7562320	bass fishing.
7562320	7568080	And then but now she just sits down and watches us play because she's really fat and lazy.
7568080	7572920	Marissa in chat says, that has inspired me to name a cat if I ever get one, Gilda.
7572920	7574440	What an amazing name for a cat.
7574440	7575440	What an amazing woman.
7575440	7576440	Gilda, by the way.
7576440	7577440	My sims have a cat named Sylvia.
7577440	7578440	Sorry.
7578440	7580680	I'm going to get all weepy if we keep talking about these, like, cats.
7580680	7582880	Let me see if I've got another email.
7582880	7584800	Don't we have a dick and fart joke?
7584800	7585880	Can't we tell more junior men jokes?
7585880	7586880	Something?
7586880	7587880	Oh, shoot.
7587880	7588880	I forgot to read the very last part of that email.
7588880	7589880	Oh, okay.
7589880	7593000	In case you were curious, the title of this email, and lost a friend, is a reference to
7593000	7596900	the Exploder Evacuator Part 2 radio commercial from GTA Vice City.
7596900	7598840	Now you know annoying is half the battle.
7598840	7600240	Peace, Smiley.
7600240	7604200	Well, best of luck with and I'm really sorry to hear about your loss.
7604200	7607960	And if your family decides to get another cat, there are many, many cats out there who
7607960	7608960	need love.
7608960	7609960	Adopt a cat.
7609960	7612640	Everyone go out there and adopt a cat.
7612640	7614280	Well, some people are allergic.
7614280	7615280	Some people don't.
7615280	7616280	So I'm allergic.
7616280	7619800	I have air filters in my house and I take sinus medicine every day.
7619800	7621400	I love my cat.
7621400	7624220	I will do whatever I can to keep my cat.
7624220	7629160	So if I can't, the only thing I won't get a dog because I'm actually so allergic to
7629160	7631000	dogs that allergy medicine does not touch it.
7631000	7633880	I actually, I don't know if I've ever gotten into this on the show and maybe I shouldn't,
7633880	7635640	but I actually have a fear of dogs.
7635640	7636640	It's taken me a little.
7636640	7637640	Do you?
7637640	7639800	Yes, I have a, I have a definite case of fear of dogs.
7639800	7640800	It doesn't matter the size.
7640800	7642440	I get really nervous around dogs.
7642440	7646860	I've gotten a lot better with it in the past five years than I would say from the time
7646860	7649720	I was five through about the time I was like 21.
7649720	7650720	It was really bad.
7650720	7655920	Like whenever I get around dogs, I get really nervous, like I can't like be around dogs.
7655920	7661160	And this goes back to, I was bit by one when I was five and it was very, um, traumatic.
7661160	7663160	So be careful with that book.
7663160	7665160	It's older than me.
7665160	7666160	Oh yeah.
7666160	7667160	Okay.
7667160	7668160	Um, you know what though?
7668160	7669160	You should meet pocket.
7669160	7670720	I think actually you'd scream like a little girl about pocket.
7670720	7671720	See, here's the thing.
7671720	7675000	And I don't want to disappoint you, but everybody tells me I would feel different about their
7675000	7679780	dog and I won't like, I'm just, no, I think you'd scream like a little girl around pocket.
7679780	7680780	What is this big?
7680780	7685600	Oh, then, Oh, well that would scream in terror and you would, you want to put me in my own
7685600	7686600	personal hell.
7686600	7687600	Sure.
7687600	7688600	I'll do that.
7688600	7691720	And has the loudest bark ever.
7691720	7693360	That's not even, I don't have a dog.
7693360	7696080	I won't have a dog and I don't let them in my house.
7696080	7698040	Um, so you don't have to worry about it for me.
7698040	7704480	The only kind of dog I want is a, is a, uh, corgi, uh, I N G N zero and I'm sorry, I'm
7704480	7705480	sorry.
7705480	7706480	I'm not pronouncing your name right.
7706480	7707480	Probably says a Rob.
7707480	7709040	You fear guns, projectiles and dogs.
7709040	7710040	Yeah.
7710040	7711040	That about covers it.
7711040	7714560	You know, I wonder if you would be okay with the Basenji.
7714560	7716480	They're not really like a modern dog.
7716480	7717480	I will say this.
7717480	7721800	There has been one dog that I was able to get along with and it was my, um, grandma's
7721800	7724160	old dash on wiener dog.
7724160	7727920	Um, because yeah, it was missing an eye.
7727920	7735040	So it was a handicapped dog and very, very quiet, very slow moving, very, you know, like
7735040	7738760	very just, I needed, I need an old lazy dog.
7738760	7739760	If anything.
7739760	7740760	Well, I don't need a dog.
7740760	7741760	I will always be a cat person.
7741760	7744720	If you were to have a dog, which won't happen, if you worked, if someone told us to bring
7744720	7749000	a dog in your house, in an alternate universe, it would have to be an old lazy fat dog.
7749000	7750000	Yes.
7750000	7751000	Something like that.
7751000	7752000	Blind in one eye.
7752000	7753000	Yes.
7753000	7754000	Answer's still lucky.
7754000	7756360	So no offense to you dog owners out there, but just understand this, this goes back to
7756360	7758640	a childhood fear that I can't shake.
7758640	7760420	You have a fish called kitty.
7760420	7761420	A fish called puppy.
7761420	7762420	That's my roommates.
7762420	7763420	Not mine.
7763420	7764420	Oh, you should get a cat.
7764420	7766000	Uh, roommate doesn't want one.
7766000	7767000	And I, I understand.
7767000	7771280	Um, maybe, maybe later on, maybe later on, but I definitely am getting a cat at some
7771280	7772280	point.
7772280	7776240	But you know, when, when, uh, when there's somebody else to take care of, if you get
7776240	7780600	a boy cat name and Frank, I haven't thought of, I haven't even thought of names yet.
7780600	7781600	I get a boy cat.
7781600	7783000	His name is going to be Frank.
7783000	7788440	After Frank inverter, cheeseburger in our chat room says, Rob hell is a great Dane with
7788440	7793040	Mayo and guns pretty much pretty much that about sums it up.
7793040	7794040	All right.
7794040	7795040	Look, some more news.
7795040	7796040	Cause we want to take your calls.
7796040	7797040	All night long.
7797040	7798040	Geez, Louise.
7798040	7799040	Yeah.
7799040	7800040	You people gotta get out of my house.
7800040	7801040	All right.
7801040	7802040	Loki, please.
7802040	7807260	Um, well, I don't know if anyone remembers, uh, the old toy mad balls, but apparently
7807260	7813740	mad balls are coming back, um, with an Xbox live arcade game, uh, called mad balls in
7813740	7816360	Babbo invasion.
7816360	7822360	And it's going to be a, um, action game where you can, uh, basically like a shoot them up
7822360	7829000	action game and it's going to have, um, four player co-op, 16 player multiplayer and randomly
7829000	7830840	generated maps.
7830840	7834620	And I have their PR guy keeps hounding me.
7834620	7837260	So we have actually a meeting with them at E3.
7837260	7843800	It's my first meeting, so, uh, we'll find out more about it, but you know, when I first
7843800	7846280	saw this, I'm like mad balls, really?
7846280	7848880	Is that like a smart IP to try to bring back?
7848880	7854920	I mean, really, but reading the comments on like some of these news stories, everybody's
7854920	7857240	like really enthusiastic about it.
7857240	7858240	I'm like, okay.
7858240	7859240	Might be.
7859240	7862720	You know who won't be playing that?
7862720	7863920	Me.
7863920	7867400	I will wait for Loki's report before I make a decision either way.
7867400	7870160	Oh, I was going to drag you along.
7870160	7871160	Oh, goodie.
7871160	7872160	When is this?
7872160	7873160	Wednesday?
7873160	7874160	Noon.
7874160	7875160	Yeah.
7875160	7876160	Oh, fine.
7876160	7877160	I'll go.
7877160	7878160	We'll see.
7878160	7882280	I don't have a lot of meetings planned, but I, you know, I find, especially with the smaller
7882280	7885080	companies, if you walk up and care, they will talk your ear off.
7885080	7886480	So I'm, I'm all for it.
7886480	7887480	Why not?
7887480	7890560	Well, I don't want to spend an hour looking at this one game.
7890560	7892840	Well, yeah, I mean, well, it depends.
7892840	7893840	It depends.
7893840	7895400	I'm going to open mind, open mind.
7895400	7897960	They gave me a 15 inch spiel and that's it.
7897960	7901000	Well, they don't have a booth, so they don't really have anything to demonstrate.
7901000	7903640	I mean, we'll see.
7903640	7904640	We'll see.
7904640	7905640	All right.
7905640	7906640	More to come.
7906640	7907640	Of course.
7907640	7909480	We're not doing a show next week, are we?
7909480	7910480	Because of E3.
7910480	7911480	I'll be back.
7911480	7912960	Are you going to be back?
7912960	7915280	I'll be back, but we'll see.
7915280	7916600	We may or may not be here next week.
7916600	7918080	I know it's Bobby's 200th show.
7918080	7921640	He may want to go along or he might be tired too.
7921640	7925080	More to come on that if we will be here next week or not, but we'll definitely do something
7925080	7926080	to cover E3.
7926080	7929640	Anyhow, I want to move on though with some of the news that came out this weekend.
7929640	7931640	The next story has to do with Grand Theft Auto.
7931640	7935880	This was some news that kind of got trumped a little bit by everything else, all the leaks
7935880	7936880	coming out of E3.
7936880	7937880	This is certainly huge news.
7937880	7940040	That also proves that that last, what was it?
7940040	7941040	That Twitter.
7941040	7945720	Remember that Twitter reveal that it was supposed to have the full E3 lineup for Microsoft.
7945720	7947720	Yeah, it was a bunch of bullshit.
7947720	7948720	Oh, why?
7948720	7949720	Because they had the wrong title.
7949720	7950720	Oh, they had the wrong title.
7950720	7953000	Well, who would have thought that this would be the title?
7953000	7956280	I mean, I don't think anyone could have guessed that the official title of the next expansion
7956280	7959140	is The Ballad of Gay Tony.
7959140	7963360	And apparently in this, you will be taking on Luis Lopez, who is a part-time hoodlum
7963360	7968160	and full-time assistant to nightclub impresario Tony Prince, who is Gay Tony.
7968160	7970160	Now, I don't know enough about the story.
7970160	7971840	Loki, please explain.
7971840	7974560	Who is Gay Tony and is he just happy or is he gay?
7974560	7975560	No, he's gay.
7975560	7977400	He's a nightclub owner.
7977400	7983120	Basically, really all the expansions tie in with is there's a mission that's called the
7983120	7984880	Impossible Trinity.
7984880	7990980	And basically, it's a diamond deal that goes down bad.
7990980	8002280	Both Nico and Johnny are there doing an exchange with the Triads for selling them diamonds.
8002280	8008140	And Luis comes in and basically robs them of their diamonds and breaks up the whole
8008140	8012640	thing and there's a big gun battle in the Museum of Natural History.
8012640	8014360	So that all goes down.
8014360	8016080	I'm not really sure what they're going to cover with this.
8016080	8019760	There's a lot of speculation saying because the last expansion, they updated the rock
8019760	8021280	and rap stations and stuff.
8021280	8025840	This is going to be more of the electronica updates as far as music goes and stuff.
8025840	8030780	And it's supposed to focus around Al Gonquin, his nightclub and stuff like that.
8030780	8033080	Maybe like the safe house and stuff.
8033080	8036640	Now, before you might think my feathers are ruffled being the gay guy on the show that
8036640	8040080	they're naming this, the ballad of Gay Tony or whatever, I actually kind of don't care
8040080	8043040	because Rockstar has a track record of handling these issues pretty good.
8043040	8047960	I mean, we remember Bully, you know, actually kind of handled it fairly interesting.
8047960	8051480	And you know, I don't see any, you know, if it's a gay character in a story, who cares?
8051480	8056920	I think you run into Gay Tony in the first game, well, like the main storyline.
8056920	8060200	So you know, it's all about and how they handle it.
8060200	8061200	Yeah.
8061200	8064100	Now, but let me tell you what pisses, well, is there anything else you want to mention
8064100	8065160	about this though?
8065160	8068960	Because I'm going to segue into the FUs of the week here because there is one thing about
8068960	8070800	this that kind of pisses me off.
8070800	8075240	And it's the whole fact that you can call this game the Ballad of Gay Tony, but heaven
8075240	8078480	forbid you can't put gay in your profile.
8078480	8081940	Remember that whole thing that came up a couple of weeks ago where Microsoft says you can't,
8081940	8085800	you know, talk about the sexuality stuff in your profile, but yet it's okay to name the
8085800	8088280	game the Ballad of Gay Tony.
8088280	8090940	So I see a double standard here.
8090940	8093420	And when I see double standards, I get very irritated.
8093420	8096320	Not that I want to put gay in my profile, but if somebody does, why shouldn't they be
8096320	8097580	allowed to?
8097580	8102080	You know, if somebody wants to put, hi, I'm gay or whatever, then that's their prerogative.
8102080	8105240	If somebody puts, I hate gays, well, that's a lot different.
8105240	8106240	See what I'm saying?
8106240	8107240	Yeah.
8107240	8108400	But anyhow, there's a clear double standard here.
8108400	8109400	Double standards piss me off.
8109400	8115400	It's time for the FUs of the week.
8115400	8136920	Um, believe it or not, I don't have, I don't, I'm in a pretty darn good mood right now.
8136920	8142160	So actually, God, we're in like bizarro world tonight.
8142160	8146280	You know what, can you do some dark soccer?
8146280	8147280	Sorry to hear it.
8147280	8148280	Sorry I'm not laughing.
8148280	8153280	It's just funny out of everything that comes out of it, you got that.
8153280	8155280	Sorry to hear it.
8155280	8162400	FU to housework and because my knees hurt because I've been crawling around on laminate
8162400	8165560	flooring and they're all bruised, so that sucks.
8165560	8169560	And I still have lots of paintings to do and I have a lot of other stuff I have to do when
8169560	8173160	I'm moving in in two weeks, so yikes.
8173160	8178160	So FU to work, oh, and I've been getting up at eight in the morning working till like six
8178160	8179160	at night today.
8179160	8186240	I flipped off a day of work after the morning later worked at the house, so yeah, long days.
8186240	8187920	But how is it being in your own house now?
8187920	8193120	Um, it'll be cool when it's done and just, uh, we have like the baseboards to do and painting
8193120	8194120	and stuff.
8194120	8196120	Luckily my parents are helping out the kitchen and stuff.
8196120	8200120	My dad's been really cool when it comes down to actually, you know, help me during the
8200120	8204120	days to stop for me to come in, you know, during the times I'm gone, yeah, I use the
8204120	8207120	green stuff to come in and do all the baseboards.
8207120	8211120	Some of my mom's gonna be painting while I'm gone and stuff, so you know, couldn't have
8211120	8213120	done it without them, so it's really cool.
8213120	8215120	But yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty awesome.
8215120	8222120	I, I keep, I'm tempted because my wife promised when we get a house I could get an arcade
8222120	8223120	cabinet.
8223120	8224120	Of course she said that all the time.
8224120	8225120	She just sold ours.
8225120	8226120	So, maybe.
8226120	8231120	But I'm not building it this time.
8231120	8234120	It'll be pre, pre-cut, prefab.
8234120	8241620	All right, um, and I will, uh, go ahead and, uh, say, um, my F.U. of the week goes to spammers.
8241620	8246120	Oh my god, I've been getting more spam on Gmail lately, like I don't know what happened,
8246120	8249420	but over the weekend the spammers figured out how to get through or something, and I've
8249420	8253120	been getting spam messages like crazy on Gmail, I don't know if it's just me.
8253120	8254120	I've been too, I've been too.
8254120	8258120	I've been getting so pissed off, and it made, like, I fucking hate spammers.
8258120	8259620	I fucking hate them.
8259620	8261120	Like, why do they do this?
8261120	8264120	Like, I mean, they slow down the internet with all their traffic.
8264120	8268120	Do people actually buy the shit in these emails?
8268120	8271120	Do people actually legitimately believe this stuff?
8271120	8275120	Like, and sadly, even if one person out of a million believes it, it's probably worth
8275120	8280120	it to these people, but they're just, they're the parasites of pond scum.
8280120	8281120	They're, I hate it.
8281120	8282120	I hate it.
8282120	8288120	They stop when they start charging postage on emails, which they shouldn't do, though.
8288120	8292120	There's that, there's the, I know, there's a whole, like, double standard thing, but
8292120	8296120	they shouldn't do that, but I mean, maybe for mass emails or something they need to.
8296120	8300120	I don't know, but I'm getting so irritated with freaking spam email.
8300120	8302120	It's sick.
8302120	8304120	That's a pretty epic F.E., Rob.
8304120	8308120	Well, we should, seriously, we need to, like, in countries that support spammers, we need
8308120	8310120	to just drop a nuclear bomb or something.
8310120	8311120	Get rid of these people.
8311120	8317120	All right, I'm being a little extreme, but it is just obscene.
8317120	8320120	Like, we need to do something to stop this.
8320120	8324120	And it's not just, like, it's not just that I'm annoyed.
8324120	8325120	I am annoyed.
8325120	8330120	It's not just that, but the fact that they slow down the internet with their poop that
8330120	8332120	flies out of their keyboards.
8332120	8336120	I get more spam in my actual Orange Lounge account than I do.
8336120	8339120	Seriously, we get inundated with the Orange Lounge.
8339120	8341120	God!
8341120	8344120	I'm so sick of spam.
8344120	8345120	All right.
8345120	8351120	But, you know, it's, unfortunately, it's, you know, part of the hazards of being on
8351120	8352120	the internet.
8352120	8358120	However, I do not advocate just, you know, sitting back and letting it happen, of course.
8358120	8363120	All right, Bobby linked me to a website here with, actually, kind of a clarification, I
8363120	8367120	suppose, on the whole, you called the game Gay Tony, but you can't have gay in your
8367120	8374120	profile or whatever, and this is a website called step2.com, which is, I think he's
8374120	8381120	a guy who's involved with the, what is he, the community, I don't think he's community
8381120	8384120	director or something, but he does stuff with Microsoft.
8384120	8390120	Anyway, he basically says that the code of conduct policy does allow you to express vocally
8390120	8392120	on the service your relationship preference.
8392120	8396120	People get this wrong in saying all instances the word gay, for instance, are forbidden
8396120	8397120	from all of Xbox Live.
8397120	8400120	Therefore, this new download content represents a violation.
8400120	8401120	This is not the case.
8401120	8404120	I appreciate the appearance of a disconnect, but there isn't.
8404120	8408120	There's other content in Grand Theft Auto 4 that would likewise not be allowed in a
8408120	8409120	gamertag or profile.
8409120	8413120	Quotes from movies that you can obtain on Marketplace that are not allowed in gamertags
8413120	8414120	or profiles.
8414120	8418120	Rated, purchasable content has all sorts of technical rules and restrictions as to what
8418120	8420120	type of accounts can view them.
8420120	8424120	Limitations, synopsis and plot summary and so forth that gamertags and profiles do not
8424120	8426120	currently have.
8426120	8428120	I don't know.
8428120	8429120	I don't know.
8429120	8430120	I'm still not 100% convinced.
8430120	8433120	I'm thankful that they're aware that there's a disconnect here, but I don't know.
8433120	8437120	I'm not 100% convinced when we do see some of these reports coming out and so forth,
8437120	8440120	but I do appreciate the clarification if nothing else.
8440120	8444120	And they say they're working with these organizations, et cetera, et cetera.
8444120	8447120	They've been working with them for months and months.
8447120	8451120	Let's see what happens.
8451120	8452120	All right.
8452120	8453120	Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
8453120	8455120	We're almost to the phone.
8455120	8457120	Stark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind.
8457120	8463120	Well, this is, I don't know.
8463120	8477120	Tecmo Bowl for Wii is actually put on hold and is being converted into Family Fun Football.
8477120	8484120	They are basically saying that they're switching it to a family-oriented game because of market
8484120	8487120	research and to go to the Wii's target audience.
8487120	8491120	Because that's everybody that owns the Wii is the family demographic, and they are not
8491120	8493120	going to recognize the name Tecmo Bowl.
8493120	8494120	So they're selling out.
8494120	8496120	Sad, but it makes sense.
8496120	8498120	Makes complete sense, sadly.
8498120	8503120	But on Xbox 360, there will be Tecmo Bowl for Xbox Live Arcade, and that will be in
8503120	8505120	early 2010.
8505120	8506120	Nice.
8506120	8508120	So hunt for that at E3.
8508120	8510120	Let us know.
8510120	8511120	Cool.
8511120	8515120	There's some pretty cool stuff coming over from Exceed.
8515120	8522120	They're a company that localizes a lot of games that normally come out in Japan.
8522120	8524120	Our modern working designs?
8524120	8526120	Yes, basically.
8526120	8531120	In fact, some of the cool stuff that they're bringing to E3 this year, Ju-On the Grudge
8531120	8532120	for the Wii.
8532120	8533120	Sweet!
8533120	8536120	The Regile, Farewell, Ruins of the Moon.
8536120	8539120	That's actually supposed to be a pretty kick-ass looking game.
8539120	8543120	Lunar Silver Star Harmony for the PSP.
8543120	8545120	Half Minute Hero for the PSP.
8545120	8548120	Remember that Yusa 30 game that they had?
8548120	8550120	That looks pretty sweet.
8550120	8553120	Ark Rise Fantasia.
8553120	8555120	Flower, Sun, and Rain.
8555120	8556120	Little King's Story.
8556120	8558120	Ragnarok Online DS.
8558120	8559120	Woohoo!
8559120	8562120	And Valhalla Knights Elder Saga.
8562120	8567120	So lots of cool import-friendly stuff coming from them.
8567120	8569120	Probably a booth I'll have to visit.
8569120	8572120	Alright, well something else that is going to definitely appeal to some folks out there,
8572120	8577120	and maybe not to others, but you might remember there was some talk about a Tony Hawk skateboard
8577120	8579120	peripheral coming out very soon.
8579120	8582120	Well, some more details have leaked on Tony Hawk Ride.
8582120	8584120	That is the game, and this is from GameStop.
8584120	8586120	The game is coming out October 13th.
8586120	8589120	It's going to set you back $120.
8589120	8593120	Tony Hawk Ride, which comes with a little skateboard controller.
8593120	8596120	So, could be interesting.
8596120	8598120	Could be dangerous, too.
8598120	8602120	I mean, God, I could just see people breaking their TVs left and right with this thing.
8602120	8604120	If you're having a little too much fun.
8604120	8608120	But, I mean, I don't know, how much fun can this really be?
8608120	8611120	Am I just being a pessimist? How much fun can this really be?
8611120	8614120	I mean, isn't part of riding a skateboard having wheels?
8614120	8616120	I mean, I guess you could make the same argument.
8616120	8619120	Well, how much fun is Wii Sports because it's not actual tennis?
8619120	8622120	Or why do people play Wii Bowling and not actual bowling?
8622120	8627120	I don't know. There's something about this specifically that I'm looking at going,
8627120	8628120	how can this really be fun?
8628120	8631120	This is a little curvy board that sits on your floor. I don't know.
8631120	8633120	It'd be like, what was the arcade game?
8633120	8638120	But then again, I was defending Wii Fit earlier, so what the hell right do I have to bash this game?
8638120	8639120	I don't know.
8639120	8641120	Yeah, Rob. No, really.
8641120	8648120	It'd be like, though, what was that one Sega game that you, you know, got to do all the...
8648120	8649120	The activator?
8649120	8652120	No, I'm talking about the arcade.
8652120	8655120	It would be something along those lines, I think.
8655120	8656120	You know...
8656120	8658120	Oh, oh God, Alpine Racer.
8658120	8662120	Well, no, they had the skateboard game.
8662120	8664120	It was similar to that, though. I know what you're talking about.
8664120	8665120	A skate or something?
8665120	8666120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8666120	8671120	I guess, but even that, I don't know, had movement or something.
8671120	8675120	I mean, it wasn't just a board that was lying on the ground, you know what I mean?
8675120	8677120	Like, you actually spun around.
8677120	8679120	I remember that. You used to have the golf lamp back in the day, right?
8679120	8683120	It would actually kind of spin around and you had the railings to hold on to.
8683120	8685120	Like, this is not going to be that elaborate, you know?
8685120	8690120	You still had that feeling of motion in the game because of the whole elaborate setup it had.
8690120	8692120	That's true. That is true.
8692120	8697120	So, sj100matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelandraday.com says,
8697120	8700120	Seriously? $120? I can put that towards a real skateboard.
8700120	8703120	Hitstun corrects the name. Top Skater and AirTricks.
8703120	8706120	Top Skater, that was it. AirTricks is what I was actually thinking of.
8706120	8710120	And Rob D says there were two arcade skateboarding games, but I don't remember the names.
8710120	8711120	Well, there they were.
8711120	8714120	So, there it is.
8714120	8716120	Top Skater.
8716120	8719120	Yeah, I think that's one of the ones I'm thinking of.
8719120	8722120	And I think we had both those games at one point at Golf Land.
8722120	8725120	But this isn't it. I'll tell you that much.
8725120	8730120	One more story from all of us, then we're going to get to your calls at 1877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.
8730120	8733120	But first, a few more stories. DarkSakura.
8733120	8738120	Well, how about something for LEGO Indiana Jones? This is kind of cool.
8738120	8743120	Well, for LEGO Indiana Jones 2, I should say, is that you're going to be able to build your own stages.
8743120	8754120	So, basically, you can do levels, tombs, challenges, sandbox areas, put down plates, traps, all that kind of fun stuff.
8754120	8760120	You can actually save everything and go back and do your playthrough again on your homemade level.
8760120	8763120	It's like Forge, but for LEGO Indiana Jones.
8763120	8769120	Well, now, you're someone that likes to build your own stuff, DarkSakura, so maybe this is something that you'd be interested in?
8769120	8770120	Probably not.
8770120	8774120	If I can't violently kill people in this, I'm not interested.
8774120	8777120	Maybe I can recreate the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland.
8777120	8779120	Now that, I would be down for.
8779120	8781120	Fire!
8781120	8784120	Because that's the whole reason to ride that ride, because you get fire.
8784120	8785120	Yes.
8788120	8792120	So there's some other stuff that's coming to E3 that's going to be pretty interesting.
8792120	8797120	You may remember developer High Voltage, they're bringing out the brand new first person shooter game,
8797120	8800120	the Conduit to the Wii, pretty soon.
8800120	8804120	It's a game that's kind of pushing the edge of what the Wii can do.
8804120	8806120	They have some new games coming out, though.
8806120	8814120	The first one being Gladiator AD, an ultra-bloody fighting game that puts you in the role of a roaming gladiator.
8814120	8816120	Looks pretty sweet.
8816120	8823120	And then, to go along with that, something more like a normal traditional shooter, a game called The Grinder,
8823120	8827120	which is going to be kind of like a supernatural shooter game.
8827120	8831120	It's got like vampires and stuff like that, and werewolves.
8831120	8834120	So, looks kind of cool.
8834120	8839120	Actually, sadly enough, this game kind of reminds me a little bit of that game from Gamecock,
8839120	8842120	which I cannot remember for the life of me what it was called.
8842120	8844120	Are these games we're going to see at E3?
8844120	8847120	I don't know, they were just announced.
8847120	8850120	Maybe? I don't know if we...
8850120	8855120	Sometimes a game being at E3, though, is just a trailer showing on a monitor, you know what I mean?
8855120	8857120	A lot of these games are probably like that.
8857120	8860120	It's possible. Maybe we'll see this. I don't know, though.
8860120	8865120	Not every game is playable. I think we forget that a lot of shit at E3 is not touchable.
8865120	8868120	Like everything from Square Enix.
8868120	8872120	Usually. I bet that new Kingdom Hearts game will be playable, though.
8872120	8874120	Yeah, it's already out in Japan.
8874120	8877120	That, what, 3283 or whatever it's called? Some weird name.
8877120	8881120	Again, I don't understand, because I thought this was a series aimed at kind of kids,
8881120	8884120	and they do all this weird stuff with it, but I don't know.
8884120	8886120	I don't understand some of the Kingdom Hearts logic sometimes.
8886120	8888120	I love the games, though. I do. I really do.
8888120	8892120	And I know I'm not going to see Kingdom Hearts 3 at this year's E3, and I'm just going to be pissed.
8892120	8893120	Oh.
8893120	8895120	Are we going to go to the theater?
8895120	8898120	Thank you. Game Guru says 3582 Days is the name of it.
8898120	8902120	Yeah, I'd love to go to the theater and check it out if they have it again this year, which I assume they will.
8902120	8904120	Because it's always like a waste of time.
8904120	8906120	No, I mean, not that I don't like doing it, but it's like...
8906120	8910120	You know what? I actually like seeing the epic Squeenix trailers on the big screen.
8910120	8914120	It's like, oh my god, it's a trailer for Final Fantasy XI.
8914120	8917120	Seeing the trailer... Look, I make this comparison.
8917120	8920120	What about when you see trailers for movies on the big screen?
8920120	8923120	Like, when you saw the trailer for The Dark Knight for the first time,
8923120	8927120	or when you see the trailers for Harry Potter, if you're into that or whatever.
8927120	8931120	When you see these trailers on the big screen, isn't it so much better than when you're watching them on your tiny ass computer screen?
8931120	8932120	Yeah, it'll be alright.
8932120	8934120	Same thing. Same thing.
8934120	8936120	It depends. It really depends.
8936120	8937120	How so?
8937120	8940120	Well, I mean, because really, sometimes there's been...
8940120	8945120	I'll just see movies that I really could care less about, honestly.
8945120	8950120	So, I was like, um, why did I have to see this big? Why does it have to, you know, be involved in my life right now?
8950120	8953120	So, that's what I mean.
8953120	8956120	Alright. Well, let's move on to one more gaming story,
8956120	8959120	and then we're gonna take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
8959120	8961120	or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadial.
8961120	8967120	Please make sure, if you're gonna use Skype, make sure you've tested your call with echo123 as the username on Skype.
8967120	8969120	We had some issues last week with some of our callers,
8969120	8972120	so please make sure that your volume's okay by giving echo123 a call.
8972120	8975120	We got one more story for you guys, though, before we get to the phones,
8975120	8977120	and it has to do with the DSi,
8977120	8982120	and I guess this is one of those, uh, you knew this rumor would show up at some point.
8982120	8985120	I'm sure it's come up before. Well, guess what? It's coming up again.
8985120	8990120	Apparently, as you know, the DSi had the Game Boy Advance port removed from the game.
8990120	8995120	Well, could this possibly be because something a little shadier is in store?
8995120	9000120	You're gonna soon be able to download Game Boy Advance titles onto your DSi,
9000120	9003120	just like you download old-school Nintendo games to your Wii.
9003120	9010120	Pretty soon, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games on your DSi through the DSiWare store.
9010120	9012120	And move goes the cow.
9012120	9017120	I know, and the sheep will herd into this and, uh, buy this crap, I'm sure.
9017120	9019120	Tons and tons.
9019120	9020120	No, I don't know, though. There might be-
9020120	9025120	And at the same time, why can't they just put this stuff on the Wii?
9025120	9027120	I mean, like these Game Boy Advance titles and stuff.
9027120	9031120	Hey, or some other functionality, and maybe you can tie your accounts together,
9031120	9036120	and then if you download a Game Boy Advance title on the Wii, you can take it with you on your DSi.
9036120	9040120	That would be cool and innovative, which will never happen.
9040120	9045120	I think some people forgot, as well, we had a Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.
9045120	9046120	Yes, I remember that.
9046120	9048120	So they can put those games on your TV.
9048120	9051120	Game Boy Color player on the Super NES.
9051120	9056120	That's right. So they can put it on your TV, so don't listen to that garbage that they can't do it.
9056120	9057120	Because they can. They have.
9057120	9060120	Yeah, I was about to just say that they can and have.
9060120	9065120	But, I mean, honestly, though, you know what the deal is for them.
9065120	9069120	In the end, the only thing that it is is the bottom line.
9069120	9070120	I know, and there will be-
9070120	9071120	And they can make money.
9071120	9075120	It's instant money. It's free money. They're gonna find free money wherever they can.
9075120	9079120	That's the plan. Anyhow, let's go to the phones. They're ringing off the hook tonight.
9079120	9081120	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9081120	9082120	It's GS68.
9082120	9085120	Hello, GS68. How you doing?
9085120	9088120	Alright, I'm here to talk about Fanime.
9088120	9093120	That's right. I don't think you were there last week while our show was going on, so how was fun?
9093120	9099120	Yeah, unlike last year, I didn't get to call in at all, or listen at all.
9099120	9104120	That's alright. We had a short show last week because of the holidays, so we didn't end up doing a whole lot.
9104120	9106120	And Loki wasn't here, so...
9106120	9109120	And I know it hasn't gone on the podcast feed yet, but it will soon.
9109120	9112120	So, what's on your mind? How was the con? Tell us about it.
9112120	9119120	It was pretty good. I was mostly in the gaming room this year, and I saw the most badass 2DX setup.
9119120	9126120	Like, someone had actual arcade hardware hooked up to a PS2 with one of the PS2 versions of 2DX,
9126120	9131120	so my one complaint was that it was not an HDTV, so it was very laggy.
9131120	9134120	That's pretty cool. What else was in the game room?
9134120	9141120	What else? They had a bunch of scrolling shooters, like Radiant Silvergun and Gradius.
9141120	9145120	One of my friends brought his Tetris of Grandmaster arcade board, so I got to play that.
9145120	9150120	Did they still have, like, one thing I remember from the last Fanime I went to, which was a couple years ago,
9150120	9156120	tons and tons and tons of DS gamers, like, you know, all playing the Japanese games and stuff,
9156120	9160120	and beaming the games to each other, like, there's just tons of that that goes on.
9160120	9166120	I didn't really need some DS so much this year, but I will say this for the Bomani fans,
9166120	9172120	the arcade finally had an actual version of Pop'n Music, not Animelo 2, thankfully.
9172120	9175120	Hmm. Alright.
9175120	9176120	Oh, that's...
9176120	9177120	No, go ahead.
9177120	9180120	Yeah, instead of Pop'n Music, Animelo 2 did Pop'n 14.
9180120	9184120	That's good. That's definitely worthwhile.
9184120	9190120	How about anime stuff? I know we don't talk a lot about anime on this show, but did you see some cool stuff going on?
9190120	9194120	Like, any cool panels that you saw? I know we weren't there this year, but...
9194120	9199120	I went to one gathering, but it wasn't as good as the same one from last year,
9199120	9207120	and I went to a panel called Bonstar Cave. This is a video game trivia show panel thingy, and it was pretty awesome.
9207120	9213120	That's one thing I really want to get into doing, these cons, these game show type things, because I think it would be a lot of fun.
9213120	9220120	Like, a lot of references to older video games, like 16-bit video games,
9220120	9229120	like, your questions are represented by enemies, and so do enemies, or versions of enemies from older games,
9229120	9233120	like Mr. Batty from Earthbound, or Dr. Robotnik with 12 balls and chains,
9233120	9238120	or this Labyrinth Zone dance party thing where if you get the question right, it ends,
9238120	9242120	but if you get it wrong, you get a sonic drowning if you get it drowned.
9242120	9246120	Interesting. Some people have a lot of time. A lot of free time on their hands.
9246120	9251120	You know what's... I gotta say this, because I don't think I ever said this about Anime Central when I was talking about this,
9251120	9259120	that was the most recent con I went to, but one of the panels that they were supposed to do was, like, live recreations of cases from Phoenix Wright,
9259120	9263120	where they were going to basically do the cases from Phoenix Wright as a play, at least that's how it read in the book.
9263120	9268120	I remember that one, and even though I went to the Ace Attorney gathering...
9268120	9274120	It was not what we thought it would be. We tried to go there to the panel, and it was hard to hear,
9274120	9279120	they weren't really reading off a script, they were just kind of making it up, it seems we left after five minutes, it wasn't...
9279120	9284120	We were like, god damn it, this seemed so much better in the panel, like, this could have been epic!
9284120	9288120	Objection! You know, they could have gone off the script from the game and it would have been beautiful.
9288120	9298120	Yeah, what else... I went to the cosplay chess, which is like, basically you have a chess board, two people playing chess, and then you have a bigger chess board,
9298120	9305120	where they represent the chess gameplay on the huge board with cosplayers, that was pretty fun.
9305120	9309120	Any good video game cosplay that you saw?
9309120	9317120	A whole lot, hold on, let me just post my pictures from the bottom in the chat room.
9317120	9322120	It has a chat.orangelaungeradio.com, if you want to check that out, I see the link there.
9322120	9331120	Yeah, I saw a few video game cosplay gatherings, and I cosplayed as a character myself, and that was kind of funny.
9331120	9339120	Like, I went to my apologizes cosplay, and a lot of people recognized me, and I went to my pop-in cosplay, and only three people recognized me.
9339120	9342120	Then again, I wasn't really surprised.
9342120	9346120	What would you say was the best video game cosplay you saw?
9346120	9348120	I'm not sure.
9348120	9351120	Like...
9351120	9363120	Yeah, I saw Captain Commander cosplay, and that was pretty cool, because the cosplayer had neon lights on his costume, which was awesome.
9363120	9368120	Alright, fair enough. Well, gs68, any other thoughts about Phantom 8 before we let you go and take some more calls?
9368120	9377120	Um, yeah, I went to YaliCon Bingo for the hell of it. I didn't win anything, but...
9377120	9379120	YaliCon Bingo.
9379120	9380120	Yes.
9380120	9386120	This sounds like one of those things I have to experience at least once in my life. I've heard of YaliCon for probably ten years now, and I've never really gone.
9386120	9387120	You probably should.
9387120	9390120	I've been to YaliCon before, Rob, it's interesting.
9390120	9391120	Maybe at some point.
9391120	9396120	Yeah, I might go to YaliCon this year, but only for one day. Same with that anime summer version.
9396120	9401120	Oh, okay. Well, maybe we haven't had sac animes in our neck of the woods, we haven't been there in forever. We'll see.
9401120	9408120	Alright, we gotta let you go though so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much gs68, I'm glad to hear you had a fun time at Phantom 8, and we should be back next year.
9408120	9410120	Alright, see you next year then.
9410120	9411120	Later!
9411120	9416120	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9416120	9417120	Hey, it's Rama.
9417120	9418120	Hey Rama, how you doing?
9418120	9419120	Hi!
9419120	9420120	Not much.
9420120	9422120	Scott, I have a bit of a bone to pick with you now.
9422120	9424120	Oh, Jesus, what?
9424120	9429120	Not all spam is bad. Sometimes it's pretty tasty between a couple slices of bread.
9429120	9432120	I hate you.
9432120	9434120	You know what I meant.
9434120	9438120	I know, but you opened the door for me. You don't do that.
9438120	9443120	I did. Hey, you got me back for the purple spaceship from earlier in the show, so there you go.
9443120	9445120	Oh, that was a good play. I loved it. That was a good play.
9445120	9451120	The chat room is telling me to hang up on you for that, so you better talk quick to save yourself. What else is on your mind?
9451120	9454120	Two words. Anime Boston.
9454120	9457120	Alright, how was Anime Boston?
9457120	9465120	Seriously, it lacked. It just didn't have the same oomph or feeling as the last Anime Boston that I've attended.
9465120	9469120	You know, I've been going since the first year.
9469120	9479120	I would guess it probably lacked because every year it's so packed full of people, it takes you instead of like 10 minutes to get from point A to point B, maybe 20 minutes.
9479120	9485120	Now it takes five minutes. I'm just guessing because they've redesigned the logistics of where everything was this year.
9485120	9492120	Let me ask you a question that came up last week. One of our other listeners went to Anime Boston. We were kind of grilling him on it a little bit.
9492120	9503120	And one thing that we asked about was the location, because apparently the place that they have Anime Boston is where they're going to have Penny Arcade Expo East Coast version is the same venue.
9503120	9506120	Will it fit?
9506120	9519120	I've been saying no, no, and no. Because the convention center holds like maybe we're between 10,000 to 15,000 people and AB has hit anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 and it has been jam-packed.
9519120	9531120	If they do it right, they may be able to pull it off. If not, when you get there late Friday afternoon or Friday evening, don't be too surprised to see signs on the door that says fail to capacity due to fire code.
9531120	9538120	Wow. Rob D. in chat clarifies they are estimating 20,000 people for PAX East. They're insane.
9538120	9550120	And if that's the case, the Hines might just be able to pull it off. It is three floors. It's not tremendously huge as like the Baltimore Convention Center which can hold about 24,000 people.
9550120	9552120	I can see the Hines maybe half that.
9552120	9558120	They'll probably spill into some neighboring facilities and some of the hotels that I imagine are right nearby there. Like that's kind of what ASEN does.
9558120	9565120	They have the convention center, but they also spill into the nearby hotels. So I'm sure PAX will do something like that if there's that much demand there.
9565120	9571120	Yeah, because it's like there's two hotels attached to the Hind and there's two more hotels within walking distance.
9571120	9580120	Interesting. Anything else on your mind tonight? Actually, I want to ask you real quick, what did you see on a Boston GamingWise that you wanted to share with us?
9580120	9583120	DDR4thMix Plus Machine.
9583120	9585120	Epic win. I missed that one.
9585120	9592120	And I also discovered what the whole Nintendo booth was and since you went to ASEN, you probably saw it too.
9592120	9593120	Hmm.
9593120	9595120	You didn't see it?
9595120	9597120	No, the Nintendo booth?
9597120	9601120	Yeah, it was in the dealer's room. They had a complete display for Fire Emblem.
9601120	9605120	Yes, they did. They were selling the hell out of that new Fire Emblem game, yeah.
9605120	9607120	Yes, yes it was.
9607120	9616120	Indeed. I keep forgetting that I thought that was the makers, I guess it was Nintendo publishing it, but I thought for some reason, I don't know, it didn't click on my mind. I'm slow.
9616120	9620120	But yeah, I definitely saw that on the floor. They were a very popular booth.
9620120	9625120	Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you go to get in some more calls and then go wrap up the show, so thanks so much for calling, okay?
9625120	9627120	No problem. Take care, guys.
9627120	9628120	Later, bud.
9628120	9629120	Later.
9629120	9632120	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype.
9632120	9636120	Orange Lounge Radio is the phone number to call.
9636120	9641120	We'll take a few more calls before we leave you guys tonight.
9641120	9647120	I just answered one and they hung up right away. I think somebody is redialing so fast that they're not actually able to get through.
9647120	9650120	I think we got one call here, though. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9650120	9652120	This is Ingo.
9652120	9656120	Hey, Ingo! Good, I was wondering how to say that. What's on your mind, Ingo?
9656120	9668120	Nothing really much. I was wondering, is it worth 200 bucks to get a 360? I already have a PS3, but I was just wondering.
9668120	9674120	The golden rule of gaming, we've said time and again here on Orange Lounge Radio, is a console is only as good as the games that are on it.
9674120	9678120	You have to really look at what's available on the Xbox 360, and you have to look.
9678120	9685120	Are these games that I can't get on the PlayStation 3, or are these games giving me an experience I can't get on the PlayStation 3?
9685120	9688120	I'm phrasing it like that to you because you already own a PlayStation 3.
9688120	9693120	Most people are usually going the other way around where they already have the Xbox and want to get the PlayStation 3.
9693120	9696120	Or they don't have either of them and they want to know which one of the two to buy.
9696120	9702120	Usually I push people towards the Xbox 360 because they have, in my opinion, the better exclusives.
9702120	9707120	Whereas, if you're looking for a multimedia thing, the PlayStation 3 obviously has the Blu-ray.
9707120	9711120	It's got the better web and all that stuff. It makes a better multimedia box.
9711120	9716120	But since you already have that, you're really going to have to look at the Xbox exclusive games.
9716120	9725120	Are you somebody that plays Halo? Are you somebody that plays Mass Effect 1 and some of these other games that are exclusive on Xbox 360?
9725120	9727120	I'm having a total brain lapse right now. What are some of the other games?
9727120	9728120	Here's a War.
9728120	9730120	Here's a War. DDR Universe.
9730120	9731120	Fable 2.
9731120	9734120	Yeah. Are these games of interest to you?
9734120	9739120	No, I'll have to think about it for a little bit. Just some exclusive games.
9739120	9742120	Well, here's my question to you and you should ask yourself the same thing.
9742120	9748120	If I were to drop $200 on Xbox 360, what would be the first game I'd play on it?
9748120	9751120	For me, it'd probably be Grand Theft Auto IV.
9751120	9757120	Well, there you go. But see, Grand Theft Auto IV is also a game that you can get on the PlayStation 3.
9757120	9760120	But, of course, Xbox 360 also has the multiplayer.
9760120	9766120	Well, they have the multiplayer in the PS3 as well. They have the expansions. That's pretty much it for right now.
9766120	9770120	The multiplayer on the PS3 sucks.
9770120	9776120	Are you happy with the PlayStation 3 or are you a little disgruntled with where they've gone with it?
9776120	9781120	And that's why you're thinking about maybe going to Xbox?
9781120	9788120	I'm really happy with my PS3 because, well, yeah, I don't know why.
9788120	9794120	But, no, I really shouldn't until it sort of went down.
9794120	9798120	But, yeah, I got a 500GB PS3 now, so...
9798120	9802120	Nice, a modded PS3. And, hey, maybe you can get one of those phones where you can stream your pornography
9802120	9805120	at anywhere you want in the world over 3G.
9805120	9807120	No, I'm not one of those people.
9807120	9811120	All right. I'm trying to think of what else I want to ask you in regards to this...
9811120	9816120	Wait until after E3 and that's all their new games. You can see if there's anything that tickles your fancy.
9816120	9818120	You know what? That's a really good point as well.
9818120	9823120	With all these rumors of the motion control device and everything that Xbox is supposed to be coming out,
9823120	9825120	maybe that's going to be your incentive.
9825120	9827120	And there also might be a price drop or two.
9827120	9832120	So definitely don't buy anything until at least after, what, noon tomorrow after the press conference is done.
9832120	9834120	They're just waiting till the holidays.
9834120	9836120	Yeah, if you can wait that long.
9836120	9839120	If you were to tell me that, Loki, and I really wanted an Xbox 360, I'd be like,
9839120	9841120	No, I can't wait that long. I want it now.
9841120	9844120	I'll pay the extra 100 bucks. I don't care. I want it now.
9844120	9847120	I mean, any of us that buy a console the first day it comes out,
9847120	9849120	we all know the damn thing is going to drop.
9849120	9851120	I don't know what you're talking about.
9851120	9854120	Who was it that paid how much for an Xbox 360?
9854120	9855120	$700.
9855120	9856120	That's what I thought. Thank you very much.
9856120	9857120	I also own five of them.
9857120	9859120	Thank you very much. Case in point.
9859120	9861120	Sorry, Ingo.
9861120	9863120	Well, good luck to you.
9863120	9866120	I hope you are able to figure it out.
9866120	9870120	And let us know if you do end up buying the Xbox 360 and what you do play on it.
9870120	9872120	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9872120	9879120	Um, Loki, you should check your friend requests on your PS3.
9879120	9886120	I haven't been on my PS3. Well, I have been on my PS3, but not browsing games.
9886120	9888120	We've been streaming the porn.
9888120	9889120	Watching porn, exactly.
9889120	9891120	We've been streaming movies out of it.
9891120	9893120	But yeah, I haven't been on PlayStation Network in a while.
9893120	9896120	Black Wolf would like to remind everybody that he is Loki's only friend.
9896120	9898120	Not anymore, Black Wolf. Sorry.
9898120	9901120	Oh, you cheated on him. I would cry if I were Bobby.
9901120	9903120	Alright, Ingo, we're going to let you go to get a couple more calls and get out of here.
9903120	9905120	But have a good night, okay?
9905120	9906120	You too.
9906120	9907120	Later, bud.
9907120	9910120	What was I going to say? The Rob D. in chat says, because Motion on the 360...
9910120	9912120	Oh, actually, this is his call.
9912120	9914120	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9914120	9915120	What's up, guys? It's the Rob D.
9915120	9917120	I was just about to read one of your comments in chat.
9917120	9921120	You put, because Motion on the 360 is going to be good. Laugh.
9921120	9922120	Yeah, I know.
9922120	9924120	What if it is? What if it is, Rob?
9924120	9929120	Um, then I'll gladly eat ecro, but I really doubt it's actually going to be good.
9929120	9931120	You really think it's going to be anything more than a gimmick?
9931120	9933120	It's a cup of mayonnaise tonight, Rob.
9933120	9935120	I don't know if you were here earlier in the night.
9935120	9938120	Honestly, there is going to be a motion controller regardless of this camera thing,
9938120	9946120	because the third-party game accessory developer, PDP, is putting out their Magic Wand controller thing.
9946120	9949120	It has a game that comes with it called Squeeballs.
9949120	9951120	And it looks like the Wii remote.
9951120	9956120	As long as I can waggle my Squeeballs, I'll be good.
9956120	9961120	Wow. You know, there could be something good out of this. I don't know.
9961120	9963120	You know, it might be a hell of a party thing.
9963120	9967120	I don't think it's something I'm going to sit there and play in the room by myself,
9967120	9969120	look at me flailing about like an asshole.
9969120	9971120	Oh my god, did we get a totem ball sequel?
9971120	9973120	Can I buy another useless camera?
9973120	9977120	I'd somehow don't think Rob called in tonight to talk about Microsoft Motion Control.
9977120	9980120	Let me turn it over to Rob. What's on your mind tonight?
9980120	9983120	Well, I have to ask you guys to bear with me a little bit, because I'm currently sick,
9983120	9985120	and I'm coughing all over the place.
9985120	9988120	I have no voice, and I've been doing the show all night tonight, so it's fine.
9988120	9992120	Would you like your third convention report of the night, since I went to Anime North in Toronto?
9992120	9996120	Apparently we are the convention hub on the internet.
9996120	9997120	I guess so.
9997120	10001120	We should just name ourselves the convention cast. That's all right. How was it?
10001120	10004120	It was fun. Toronto is actually a really cool city.
10004120	10006120	It's the first time I've been there in about a decade,
10006120	10010120	and though they don't really care too much for copyright infringement,
10010120	10014120	as you can see from the picture I just posted in chat, which is hilarious,
10014120	10018120	it was a great place to have a convention, even though it was a little bit outside the city,
10018120	10023120	but I managed to have a friend show me around anyway.
10023120	10025120	So you actually got to see the city when you went to the convention,
10025120	10029120	because when I went to Chicago, I saw a little bit of downtown.
10029120	10031120	That was when we got lost one night. That was about it.
10031120	10035120	Wow, I'm looking at this picture. Mario Brothers Fast Foods, apparently.
10035120	10039120	Totally unrelated to the Mario Brothers. They're the Mario Bros.
10039120	10043120	Do they serve Mario broth soup there or something? What the hell?
10043120	10045120	I don't know. You can actually see they're under renovation.
10045120	10051120	I would have totally eaten there, but I decided to eat this little concoction for lunch instead,
10051120	10053120	something called poutine.
10053120	10056120	Oh, God, yes, I've heard of this. That's the Canadian, it's like the French fries and gravy, right?
10056120	10057120	Yeah, it's fantastic.
10057120	10062120	French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. If that doesn't stop your heart, I don't know what will.
10062120	10063120	It's a beautiful stuff.
10063120	10064120	But either way, the convention, though.
10064120	10068120	Instant pancreas attack right there if I eat that. All right, sorry, convention, yes.
10068120	10073120	The Friday was kind of interesting because I saw on the schedule that they had something called Anime Pro Wrestling,
10073120	10077120	and I thought it was a total joke, but no, they actually got some independent wrestling promotion
10077120	10084120	to actually have Anime Pro Wrestling, and they had me when they had Scorpion and Sub-Zero versus Inspector Gumshoe
10084120	10086120	and the guy from Helsing, so...
10086120	10088120	Wow.
10088120	10093120	Video game related, the game room, I know this is a theme with me lately, but the game room kind of sucked.
10093120	10097120	You know how you said it's great when the conventions actually spill over into the surrounding hotels?
10097120	10098120	Mm-hmm.
10098120	10101120	It's not so great when that surrounding hotel is a half mile away.
10101120	10103120	Oh, yeah, that's not good.
10103120	10108120	That sounds very Anime Expo, which is why I quit going.
10108120	10112120	Yeah, I went over there for most of Saturday, and of course they ended up scrapping the Street Fighter IV tournament
10112120	10118120	three hours after it was supposed to start, but I'm not bitter, not at all.
10118120	10124120	I went there on the Morian, all they had to play was Brawl, a pinball game on the PS2, I don't even know what it was,
10124120	10129120	and SBC Chaos, oh, and Ikaruga, which is, I guess that's fun.
10129120	10134120	But the real highlight of the convention was me taking a picture with the voice of Link, Nobuyuki Hiyama,
10134120	10139120	and the voice of Joe Higashi, the voice of Vyral, the voice of Siegfried from Soul Calibur.
10139120	10142120	They got some pretty good celebs up there in Canadian, don't they?
10142120	10144120	I know, right?
10144120	10145120	Wow.
10145120	10146120	That was a ton of fun.
10146120	10149120	I'm looking at the picture right now, there you are, there he is.
10149120	10151120	Too bad it wasn't the voice of Navi.
10151120	10156120	Hey, listen, hey, listen, I would love to get that person to do a bumper for OLR.
10156120	10162120	Hey, listen, hey, listen, to OLR.
10162120	10165120	Sorry, I don't know what the hell possessed me for that.
10165120	10174120	Alright, so on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blow your mind, awesome, con of the year, like, better than Penny Arcade Expo,
10174120	10179120	1 being, oh my god, this sucked, where would you rate this convention?
10179120	10182120	I'd rate it at about a solid 8, I expect Otacon to be better,
10182120	10188120	because last year at Otacon was just a really great experience, and especially since I have a panel at Otacon this year, it's going to be a ton of fun.
10188120	10190120	Of course, that makes everything better. Rob D panel makes everything better.
10190120	10192120	The only thing better than a Rob D panel?
10192120	10194120	Is a Sky panel.
10194120	10195120	That's right.
10195120	10197120	I'm just messing.
10197120	10202120	Alright, Rob, we've got to let you go so we can go wrap up the show, but thank you for making our show now with more Poutin.
10202120	10203120	I appreciate that.
10203120	10204120	You know it.
10204120	10205120	Alright, take care.
10205120	10206120	You always need more French fries and cheese carrots.
10206120	10207120	Alright, take care, buddy.
10207120	10208120	See you later, man.
10208120	10209120	Bye.
10209120	10216120	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skyline tonight. Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're at about 9.20 in between this and our afterbirth and everything.
10216120	10218120	We don't want to be here too late tonight.
10218120	10221120	So, we're going to go ahead and go around and wrap everything up.
10221120	10223120	Again, remember, if you guys didn't get through, we do need more emails always.
10223120	10226120	Put Jamie to work. Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send him.
10226120	10228120	Hey, I'm not here to work.
10228120	10230120	Alright, Dark Sakura, I'm going to make you work right now.
10230120	10232120	Oh, actually, I want to go around and see if there's any last-minute stories.
10232120	10234120	I know it was a busy Newsweek. Do you have anything, Dark Sakura?
10234120	10235120	I don't.
10235120	10237120	Loki, I know you've got to have something.
10237120	10239120	Yes, I do. Of course.
10239120	10241120	Just some last-minute stories.
10241120	10244120	ESRB is rated Final Fantasy VII for the PS3 and the PSP.
10244120	10245120	What?
10245120	10250120	Basically, the PlayStation Network version of it where you can download the PlayStation 1 game.
10250120	10259120	Most people's guess is that it's going to come out with the release of the Blu-ray of Final Fantasy Advent Children Complete since that's when it came out in Japan.
10259120	10261120	So, in a few more weeks.
10261120	10269120	Another surprise Sony-related. Apparently, there was a Sony PlayStation blog E3 2009 meetup in LA.
10269120	10275120	Well, apparently, the first hundred people in line also got E3 passes, so lucky them.
10275120	10279120	Let's see here.
10279120	10283120	That is very lucky. I would like to know if any of our listeners were one of those hundred people.
10283120	10286120	Remember, I'm looking for hugs at E3 if you are.
10286120	10291120	There's a rumor to another game being announced for the Halo series.
10291120	10302120	Apparently, from the Bungie blog, their search engine has a drop-down where you can search specific forums, and one of those forums was Halo Reach.
10302120	10306120	And that's different than, I guess, the Halo 3 forum and the Halo ODST.
10306120	10308120	And certainly a better name than Halo Reach around.
10308120	10310120	Yes, it is.
10310120	10321120	Ubisoft is bringing more game show based games to the Wii, including Press Your Luck, Family Feud, and they're going to do another Price is Right game.
10321120	10322120	Fuck no.
10322120	10324120	Price is Right is pretty...
10324120	10327120	I'm just kidding. I haven't played the Price is Right game.
10327120	10328120	It might be interesting.
10328120	10330120	By the way, completely unrelated, but I have to ask.
10330120	10338120	Did anyone see that clip on the internet of the Price is Right episode from last week where this contestant got so excited she jumped up on Drew Carey and kneed him in the balls?
10338120	10339120	Oh my god.
10339120	10341120	Like it was an accident thing. She didn't mean to do it.
10341120	10343120	But she totally kneed him in the balls and took him down.
10343120	10345120	Like he was like, oh my god.
10345120	10347120	I think it was on TMZ or something if you have to see it.
10347120	10348120	It's hilarious.
10348120	10349120	Sorry, completely random.
10349120	10351120	But fuck yes to Press Your Luck.
10351120	10361120	They have a Splinter Cell banner, of course, outside of the LA Convention Center kind of confirming still that it's an Xbox 360 exclusive.
10361120	10363120	No big surprise there.
10363120	10367120	And some other homebrew stuff actually interesting.
10367120	10371120	There's a project someone's working on called Metroid 2.5.
10371120	10376120	It's going to be kind of a 2.5D version of Metroid 2 and kind of 3.
10376120	10380120	Oh, in other words, what Metroid on the GameCube should have been, in my opinion.
10380120	10383120	There's a lot of Prime fans that would disagree with me.
10383120	10385120	It's quite different than what you would think.
10385120	10397120	It's actually really weird. Like Super Paper Mario almost, but not Metroid. Mega Man, I'm sorry. Mega Man 2.5.
10397120	10400120	Oh, well, you changed everything.
10400120	10401120	Not Metroid.
10401120	10406120	No, there is still a Metroid 2.5 type of game that's coming out that someone's making.
10406120	10408120	That Metroid 2 fusion thing.
10408120	10410120	That looked interesting.
10410120	10415120	And then there is another homebrew game that's coming out on the DS.
10415120	10418120	Someone's porting Patapon to the DS.
10418120	10421120	It actually looks kind of cool. They have some gameplay footage of that online.
10421120	10428120	And also, you may remember there was a Chrono Trigger sequel that someone was making out of a hacked ROM.
10428120	10434120	Chrono Trigger, Crimson Echoes, and Square Enix had kind of put a stop to that game.
10434120	10436120	Well, the ROM leaked out.
10436120	10441120	I fucking told you this would happen. I fucking said it that night that we covered this story.
10441120	10447120	It's going to leak anyway, and they're going to be like, oops, I didn't know, sorry guys, didn't know, didn't mean to.
10447120	10449120	We all knew it was going to come out anyway.
10449120	10454120	Originally, they thought it was going to be the 98% finished version of it, but now it's an alpha version of it.
10454120	10456120	So it's not complete, but it's...
10456120	10457120	Oh, well...
10457120	10458120	Complete enough?
10458120	10459120	...tricky around it.
10459120	10462120	No, you wait. There will be a 100% version that shows up soon enough.
10462120	10463120	Just you wait.
10463120	10464120	Yeah.
10464120	10467120	They'll be able to get away with it. Oh, well, we followed the seasons. We didn't know.
10467120	10470120	And is Squeenus going to lose any money? No.
10470120	10473120	So if they just go after these guys, they're just going to be jerks.
10473120	10475120	Asses?
10475120	10479120	Yeah, so yeah, I am not surprised one bit that that came out.
10479120	10482120	And there's millions of people downloading it now, I'm sure.
10482120	10483120	Millions of Chrono Trigger games.
10483120	10484120	I better include myself.
10484120	10487120	I know. I'm like, things to do when I get home.
10487120	10493120	And then finally, there's a new music game coming out from the founders of Rockstar Games.
10493120	10498120	Actually, the founders of the developer did Grand Theft Auto, the original game.
10498120	10501120	4 millimeters, I guess, is the studio.
10501120	10505120	And apparently, they have a game called Def Jam Rapstar.
10505120	10509120	Kind of the urban version of Singstar, if you will.
10509120	10511120	That will be at E3.
10511120	10512120	Yippee.
10512120	10513120	And that's it.
10513120	10517120	Alright. We're getting out of here. We're done for the night.
10517120	10518120	Are we?
10518120	10520120	We gotta wrap up, yeah. We gotta do our live-only segment real quick.
10520120	10523120	And then get out of here. It's almost 10 o'clock on the west coast, if you can believe it.
10523120	10526120	Long show tonight, but we had a lot of news. What did you expect?
10526120	10528120	Really? I mean, we've got E3 coming up.
10528120	10529120	Exactly.
10529120	10530120	Wait till next time.
10530120	10534120	And if we are here next Sunday, which I don't see why we wouldn't be, but we'll see.
10534120	10535120	We'll see, yeah.
10535120	10538120	Maybe like a short show Sunday. That's what I'm thinking is gonna happen.
10538120	10540120	Maybe we'll do, well, we'll talk.
10540120	10543120	Because I know Bobby might want to go along because this is his 200th show.
10543120	10544120	We'll worry about it later.
10544120	10548120	I know we gotta do some type of E3 impression show. We've got to.
10548120	10551120	And Dark Sakura, since you're not going, you gotta keep an eye on it from home.
10551120	10552120	I guess.
10552120	10554120	And keep an eye on all the blogs and all that fun stuff.
10554120	10555120	I guess.
10555120	10561120	Alright. Anyhow, let's see. We're gonna wrap up and get on out of here.
10561120	10565120	Everybody's final thought tonight. Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought?
10565120	10568120	I made my garage too big.
10568120	10570120	Loki, your final thought?
10570120	10573120	I have to play more fuel and then kill some sims.
10573120	10579120	My final thought is I gotta check out this fuel as well and I'm looking forward to going to E3.
10579120	10582120	And remember I'm looking for hugs and just to meet more people.
10582120	10586120	So if you do happen to see me out there at E3, please stop and say hello.
10586120	10587120	I'm not-
10587120	10588120	Post it.
10588120	10591120	I promise I'm not mean. Just come up and say hi. Introduce yourself.
10591120	10594120	Ask anyone who met me at ASEN or anything. I swear I'm not mean.
10594120	10595120	Like I will-
10595120	10596120	But I am.
10596120	10598120	Yes, but Loki is, so avoid him at all costs.
10598120	10599120	I am too.
10599120	10603120	But if I'm with Loki, then you're okay because I will keep him in check and he won't be mean to you.
10603120	10608120	Alright, in reality, actually Loki is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. It's just a radio persona.
10608120	10609120	It's all a lie.
10609120	10611120	It's all a lie. I'm absolutely mean.
10611120	10616120	I hate to break it to you guys here, but the mean guy persona is all a lie.
10616120	10622120	Ah, great. They're gonna have Tony Arx right at the Microsoft E3 keynote. That's gonna be boring to watch.
10622120	10628120	Hooray. Maybe that's why they suddenly did the five minute increase or whatever in time.
10628120	10632120	The Rob Dean chat says, Sky punched me in the face and threw a drink at me.
10632120	10635120	In true diva fashion.
10635120	10639120	Alright, no really, we're out of here. Thanks you guys. Have a wonderful night.
