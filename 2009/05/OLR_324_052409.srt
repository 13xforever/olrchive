00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, May 24th, 2009, an OLR favorite game is getting remade on the DS and Wii.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Did Sony confirm the smaller PS3 with their lawsuits?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Will I soon be able to rent games on my PSP?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And joining you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Porn!

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How are you doing?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Porn.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Nah, I just wanted to say porn.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is he internet for porn?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wanted the first word that I said on the show tonight to be porn.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright, well there you go, it was.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Second word of the show, official word of the show.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Tribble.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Alright, so are you into Tribble porn or something?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, I want to see Star Trek again.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh dear.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
For the third time in the theater.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then we went back to Becky's house and watched Tribble with Tribbles and then Trial and Tribulations.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Did you see the new, the HD?

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Because apparently they remade a bunch of Star Trek episodes in HD.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I have to tell you.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Everyone who goes to see the movie or goes to see it again, when they first show Scotty, look on his desk, there's a Tribble.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nice. OMG spoilers.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm just kidding.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, like the Tribble, oh and the way they defeat the guy is Tribbles.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So since you brought up porn, what would you say is your favorite porn?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The boneheads.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I have actually not seen much in the way of porn, but the boneheads.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My favorite porns are the ones that are based off of like, you know, movies and stuff too.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Ally McKeel was pretty funny.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ally McKeel is one of my favorites.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But the boneheads is a parody of Coneheads where they had collapsible head attachments.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That was actually the first one I saw.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Nice.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And my favorite animated, Bible Black.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sorry.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Bible Black is kind of cool.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's all good.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey, look in the chat.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com is always there when, you know, every night, every week that we tape this show, you guys are always there to entertain us with your chat comments.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we have Tigerclaw says, Sky, the classic Star Trek series in HD is now available in Blu-ray.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And yeah, I've heard about that.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Plus all the old movies are available in Blu-ray too.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But wake me when they have the next generation movies in Blu-ray.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I love the Mesa Summa.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Tribble porn.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Aren't Tribbles born pregnant?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
By the way, if you pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nice.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
One Night Stands in Chat says, I just saw a porno called Six Fags, Magic Mount Him.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want to see that.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, that sounds funny.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
See, those are my favorite ones.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The ones that are based off of actual movies.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And no, Final Fuck X was crap.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Good cosplay.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Really crappy porn.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We talk about games sometimes on this show.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But you're probably wondering, where's Loki?

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You haven't heard him yet.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, I mean, I know.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We gagged him with duct tape and taped him in the closet of his house.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Porn gets brought up and where's Loki to comment.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But sadly, he's not here tonight.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But it's for a good reason.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You may or may not have heard.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Loki is now a homeowner.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He got the keys to a house this week.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So him and Mrs. Loki have moved into the house.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But they have, you know, when you first move into a house, I don't know how many of you

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
know this, but there's like a million things you have to take care of when you're a homeowner,

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
especially if you're buying a fixer-upper, which I believe they did.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So they're fixing up some things right now.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But he will be back next week.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's just temporary.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's out tonight.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We are going to talk about the latest and greatest in video gaming, starting off with

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
our gaming weeks.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I do want to tell everybody, though, up front, because of the holiday, because of the fact

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
we have no Loki and because of the fact it's kind of a short news week, we do have a short

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
show tonight.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We're only going to be going for about an hour and a half tonight as opposed to our

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
usual three hours.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So apologies to those of you that were hoping for the long show tonight.

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But it's kind of a holiday.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So we're going to take it easy tonight.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But we still have your calls.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's not a drunk show, though.

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a beer show.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Dark Soccer is drinking beer.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I, however, due to everything I went through last year, I'm not drinking.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have vodka.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have Odwalla.

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I have low fat.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can't.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Just alcohol in general is a bad idea.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have some rubbing alcohol.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have wine once in a while.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have witch hazel.

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have wine once in a while.

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have wine.

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't want wine.

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have witch hazel.

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I've got to be sober tonight.

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I've got to be sober for the kids since you're setting a bad one.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I have peroxide.

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All right.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Look.

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Shut up.

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Shut up and tell us about your gaming week.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I played Sims.

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's about it.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's it?

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Really?

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Really.

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because, dude, I've been so...

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, you had finals this week, huh?

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,560
I had my last final on Monday, and after that, I was like, brain.

128
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,000
But no video games to kind of fill in that void?

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's usually what I do.

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why the hell do you think Sims is?

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a video game.

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It uses my video card.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's true.

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That is one you'll get sucked into.

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,960
Well, what kinds of things have you been enjoying in Sims?

136
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,920
Are you prepping for the release of Sims 3?

137
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Kind of.

138
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,600
But I've been enjoying porn in Sims.

139
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,160
I've actually found a bunch of naughty items that I just was curious to see how they worked,

140
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,240
so I downloaded them just to see.

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,300
They're really horrible.

142
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,760
Why do you think people go instantly to doing dirty porno things?

143
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Is it just because they can?

144
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
The first things that you learn...

145
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Okay.

146
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,980
It goes back to the first things that you learn in any language is how to cuss and how

147
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,600
to talk about sex.

148
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,000
So the first thing that you do in any game, find all the dirty crap, especially if you

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
didn't mod it.

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,480
How else do you think they found hot coffee, please?

151
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,600
How else do you think hot coffee got in the damn game?

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,640
They were gonna have some nookie in that game, hell yeah.

153
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,840
So but no, really what I've been doing, and actually my two favorite things to do is to

154
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,240
play with the Sims body shop thing where you can, you know, if you download different skins

155
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,180
and everything, you can make your own Sims look pretty cool.

156
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,680
Like I showed Rob one that I made of a couple of characters I used to have, and I've even

157
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
done one for, you know, quite a number of my old tabletop game characters are pretty

158
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
cool.

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
I did one of me.

160
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm gonna do one of Rob just because it's funny.

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,560
I want to see what that looks like when he finished.

162
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
The Rob Sim.

163
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
I might not do it in the show, but I don't know.

164
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
No later.

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
You still need to meet later.

166
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,880
But the other thing I like doing is building houses, and I've actually built some pretty

167
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
freaking...

168
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
My first house was shit.

169
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Okay.

170
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
I just...

171
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
The first house was crap.

172
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,480
The first house I built, though, is pretty damn cool, and I love it, and I would actually

173
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,660
live in that house if I could.

174
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:22,240
So I've been, you know, sort of letting out an artistic thing, you know, something that's

175
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,080
been lagging, you know, while I've been in school.

176
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
My art...

177
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,800
I guess my artsy stuff has been focused toward my assignments, towards this theme, that theme,

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,340
getting this done, getting that done, and I've really just sort of enjoyed having kind

179
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,840
of a point and click kind of artistry lately, you know, where I don't have to really use

180
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,600
my brain so much, I can just pick things as I want to.

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,080
It's been pretty cool.

182
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,920
You might need to play some Ragnarok this week, because I'm thinking about signing up,

183
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
because...

184
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Really?

185
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
I haven't played Ragnarok in about a month now.

186
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Wait a minute.

187
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Wait a minute.

188
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,640
This is the same girl who every week is like, oh, you should sign up on my server.

189
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,320
You should sign up and play some Ragnarok.

190
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
And now that I'm finally...

191
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
If you sign up and play with me, I'll play.

192
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
All right.

193
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,660
Because I might do that, because, you know, transitioning into my gaming week, I was playing

194
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,280
a little bit of World of Warcraft this week, of course, as usual, but there's theatrics

195
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
going on.

196
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
We'll leave it at that.

197
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,240
But there's theatrics, and it's just kind of making me go, whatever.

198
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,280
I mean, I play games for fun.

199
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,880
I don't know why everybody else can't do the same thing.

200
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,320
But yeah, so I'm thinking about, you know, just chilling out in another game for a little

201
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
while while I can.

202
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,160
Because life's going to get very busy with, you know, in a couple weeks being E3 and everything

203
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
going on.

204
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,180
So, you know, now's a good time to sell me on other MMOs if you want to get me to check

205
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
it out.

206
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,320
Even part of me was like, I should go back and check out Final Fantasy XI, but then I

207
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,320
was like, no, that's really a bad idea.

208
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
That's a bad idea, Rob.

209
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,200
That's a disaster waiting to happen.

210
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
It is.

211
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,480
And I'm thinking of starting on Perfect Life, now that I finally got it downloaded.

212
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,840
But, you know, Star Trek Online's going to be coming out before too long.

213
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Yeah?

214
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
And, oh my god.

215
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
I can't wait for that.

216
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
So freaking playing it.

217
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Hells yeah.

218
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm so there when that comes out.

219
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Other games in my gaming week.

220
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,840
You know, I haven't actually played an awful lot.

221
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,320
I know, it's kind of like, it's affecting both Jamie and I.

222
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,000
But I did fire up the 360 earlier this week and was still playing some Space Invaders Extreme.

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,240
And I finally bought Outrun, because I checked out the demo like a while back, but I finally

224
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,560
actually had some time to sit down.

225
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,840
I was like, I want a fun arcade racer, and hello Outrun on the Xbox Live Arcade.

226
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,920
And you know, fun little game.

227
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,880
I like racing games that are not complex, like Outrun.

228
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,600
You know, I can't get into the Forza, because I don't know enough about cars, and I don't

229
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,760
like to customize my cars.

230
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,720
I just like to step on the gas and go.

231
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,600
And Outrun is a fun, you know, it always has been a great little arcade game.

232
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,480
And I like the one on Xbox 360.

233
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
It's fun.

234
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I need to play more of the multiplayer, though.

235
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,460
I only really checked out single player this week, and was trying to beat it, and would

236
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,680
come so close, and can't seem to beat it, because I suck at video games.

237
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
No, I don't know.

238
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,920
I just, I didn't, I guess, spend enough time with it.

239
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I don't know.

240
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
But yeah.

241
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,600
Otherwise, now I've been watching some movies, and you know, just catching up on some other

242
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,840
stuff around the house, and other things going on in my personal life.

243
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,200
Tomorrow's gonna be a big video gaming day, though.

244
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,840
I don't have a lot of other stuff planned, so my things to do are clean and play video

245
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,080
games, and to get in a bunch of things before E3.

246
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,400
So I had a Twitter message asking me to check out Team Fortress 2, which I'm gonna try to

247
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
do tomorrow.

248
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,800
Also I really need to get in and play more Left 4 Dead, so I might make it a PC day tomorrow,

249
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,320
but I also want to go back and visit some of my Xbox 360 RPGs, like, I don't know why.

250
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,200
I have this real itch to go back and do Lost Odyssey, because I only really got through,

251
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,520
like, maybe the first third, or the first half, and I really want to go and finish that.

252
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,800
So we'll see.

253
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,720
So, um, yeah, that's my plans for this upcoming week.

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
How about you guys?

255
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Did you guys have a good gaming week?

256
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm looking at chat room.

257
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,120
Uh, Cheeseburger says, I saw Star Trek twice already, and I'm gonna see it again.

258
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,640
Uh, Unfolded Raptor says, I've been playing Bionic Commando all day, and I'm already 63%

259
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
done.

260
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm kinda curious how fun that is.

261
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,680
I've been hearing some mixed things on it, so I'm kinda curious what our chatters think

262
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
of that.

263
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,280
Certainly I like the old school one.

264
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,280
And I like the redone old school one.

265
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,640
That was a real fun one on Xbox Live Arcade.

266
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,120
Um, uh, let's see, also GameGuru asks, when is E3?

267
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,200
E3 is not this upcoming week, like tomorrow, but it's a week after, like it starts a week

268
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
from Tuesday.

269
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,640
June 2nd is when it starts, and I'll be going down there Monday night.

270
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,640
So we're still gonna have shows, actually, through E3 week.

271
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,740
Because Dark Sakura is not going, I do not believe we're going to be doing anything live

272
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,200
from E3, but stay tuned to the Twitter and to the website, you never know what surprise

273
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
we might have cooked up.

274
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,520
I am gonna take my video camera, but, um, as I was telling Bobby earlier, Bobby Blackwolf

275
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,700
who's before us here on Sunday nights on All Games Radio, I don't think there's a lot we

276
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,440
can do that all the big websites aren't already gonna do.

277
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,240
You know, we're not gonna be the first to report on the news, we rarely are, you know,

278
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,120
we're not gonna really be, you know, on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest E3

279
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
news.

280
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,280
All we can do is say, hey, you guys have been reading what's going on at E3, what do you

281
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,120
want us to dig and find?

282
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,680
We're your reporters on the show, we're the show where every gamer has a voice, what do

283
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,060
you want us to find?

284
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,840
So we'll be definitely using Twitter and the website and some of the things to find out

285
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,040
what you guys want us to dig up at E3, so look for that and our reports, be it in video

286
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,460
form or other tweets or what have you.

287
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,680
So we'll be looking at that.

288
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,080
I guess that's pretty much all I have to say for housekeeping tonight, too, there's not

289
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,800
a lot of housekeeping items or things to talk about what's going on, but if you aren't following

290
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,980
us on Twitter, check it out at OLR, please be kind and leave us a nice five-star review

291
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,520
on iTunes as well if you enjoy what you hear because we do the show for free.

292
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,700
Unfortunately, I saw a nice one-star one on there the other day and that's always a bummer,

293
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,560
it's like, dude, and I'm sure the person listens to this show because it seemed like the kind

294
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
of thing where it's just to get a rise out of us, it's like, dude, we do this stuff for

295
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,280
free and it's like reading stuff like that is really disheartening, you know, leave five-star

296
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,280
reviews for the show you like, but what good is it to leave a one-star review for these

297
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,760
other shows and people that work hard, you know?

298
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
Unless they're really crap.

299
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,320
You know, I would like to think we're not really crap.

300
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
You know what, Rob, I honestly, I don't care.

301
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't, but it sucks because that, and I blame Apple, it affects your ranking on the

302
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,040
whole, if you go in and look at the lineups of the shows in there, we were on page one

303
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,720
and now we dropped page three, and that's kind of disappointing, you know, that's the

304
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,080
only thing that bugs me about it, otherwise I don't care, but I must say, if you have

305
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,640
feedback or something you think we should be doing better on the show, send us an email,

306
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,640
mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, you know, do that, I'm kidding, all right, anyhow, that

307
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,720
being said, I don't want to get it too far into that, I paid that way too much attention

308
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,200
than it deserved, how about some gaming news, shall we, all right, hey, kind of a follow-up

309
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,040
to something we were talking about last week, 3D Realms, and we were talking about how 3D

310
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,920
Realms went under quote-unquote and took Duke Nukem Forever with it, well, this is interesting

311
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,000
because apparently 3D Realms actually released a public statement this week, you know, after

312
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,360
the whole development team was dissolved that was working on Duke Nukem Forever, and they

313
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,780
said they are not closed and they are not closing, however, they are saying that Take

314
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,140
Two will be retaining the publishing rights to Duke Nukem Forever and they will be able

315
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,320
to sell the game directly to the public, but what's interesting, now they're coming around,

316
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,700
they're kind of doing this little mudslinging there with Take Two, they're saying that Take

317
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,720
Two has actually bullied 3D Realms over the past year on their negotiation, what's going

318
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,240
on, and that 3D Realms is saying that Take Two tried to force a sale out of the situation

319
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,680
and 3D Realms left the table essentially, but you know, I can't help, I don't know,

320
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,320
I feel like there's two sides to every story and I still can't help but think, guys, what

321
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,780
were you producing on this game?

322
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,500
There was not a lot of public buzz going on because they refused to release screenshots,

323
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,020
there was no demo, they hadn't shown at E3 for years, what did they expect was going

324
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
to happen?

325
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,800
I mean, as much as I was excited for Duke Nukem Forever like the last guy, tease us

326
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,980
a little bit with something, you know, and I understand Take Two probably had the open

327
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,680
book and they got to see everything that was going on, but still, I mean, it's a business

328
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,360
and if people aren't, it's tough to sell a game in this day and age with, you know, look

329
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,320
at Prey and how kind of disappointing that ended up being sales-wise, you know, if there's

330
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,840
not the buzz out there for the game, it's not going to be pretty, and I bet you anything

331
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,080
now that Take Two does have the rights to this, we're going to see this game out in

332
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,680
a year or two, tops, two years tops, this game comes out.

333
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,840
Well, we can, if it ever really does, I mean, honestly, I sort of lost my expectation of

334
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,160
it really coming out.

335
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,520
I guess that's true, and you know, I don't even think at this point it might be a subpar

336
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,960
game, but I don't know, I'm not going to write it off completely, never write off a game

337
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,320
until you play it, that's what I'm planning to do.

338
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,200
Well, here's a game that some people might get to play if they have a Dreamcast, it's

339
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:48,040
coming up for Windows, Linux, and Dreamcast, yep, it's a homebrew game called Hypertension

340
00:14:48,040 --> 00:15:01,560
and it is a re-imaging of Blood, which is a Doom-based, uses the Doom-based engine.

341
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,360
So yeah, it's kind of old school in that sense, but it's coming out on Dreamcast, so hey,

342
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,280
why not if you got it, buy it, I guess.

343
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm looking a little bit at the play from it, and I'm really not impressed, I mean,

344
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,600
then again, it's old school, it's Doom-like, is that not, well, I don't know, it's got

345
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,080
some 3D, I guess, but it's not pixely, meh.

346
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,960
It looks a little like, yeah, Doomish.

347
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
It's quaky.

348
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,000
Doomish meets, yeah, kind of in that vein, the early 90s, or I guess maybe the mid-90s.

349
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,080
But the weapon is aerosol and a lighter, I love it.

350
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,480
But I mean, is there really a market for these types of Dreamcast games, it's kind of funny,

351
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,320
I don't know, does everybody report on these games because it's like, OMG, new Dreamcast

352
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
game, who would've thought?

353
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:00,180
It's a homebrew, I think it's notable, you know, there's being homebrewed, you know,

354
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
that's about it.

355
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,600
And people still love the Dreamcast, I guess, I do.

356
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,480
I guess, and one thing I did love about the Dreamcast is that there was so much homebrew

357
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,920
available for it, you know what I play most of all on my Dreamcast?

358
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
NES emulator.

359
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,840
I mean, honestly, that's one of the greatest things about it, although, I bested out Marvel

360
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,720
vs Capcom 2 the other night, yeah, yeah, good times.

361
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,520
So you did do some gaming this week, of Dan did, a little bit, we is in my household.

362
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Gotcha.

363
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,440
Well, hey, another first person shooter that's pretty popular, Metroid Prime, you know why,

364
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,840
because it's one of the few AAA first person shooters that they have on the Nintendo Wii,

365
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,640
although granted, there's some others in the works or what have you, but, you know, Metroid

366
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,320
Prime, you'd definitely say is established.

367
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,160
The Metroid series is a hugely established franchise.

368
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,520
Of course, Metroid Prime 3 was the only one that's been released on the Wii in this country,

369
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,120
however, Metroid Prime 1 and 2 were re-released over in Japan, kind of the whole new Wii controls.

370
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Well, guess what?

371
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,400
Nintendo announced this week that the Metroid Prime trilogy will be coming to the US, and

372
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,160
that means that Metroid Prime will be kind of repackaged, the first two games will have

373
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,420
the new Wii controls and the whole wide screen graphics, which, you know, I bet a lot of

374
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,380
people have mixed feelings about, but if you never really bought one or two, you know,

375
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,640
this might be a good way to revisit those games.

376
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,680
The only bummer is, no news here about Metroid Prime 4.

377
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,720
You know, if you have a Metroid Prime trilogy, and it kind of insinuates there may not be

378
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,900
a Metroid Prime 4, but I do have that hope that maybe that's one of the surprises they're

379
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,320
going to pull out at E3, but, I don't know, I wouldn't bet on it.

380
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,560
Of course, at the same time, I would like to see a new 2D Metroid, so maybe this is

381
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,440
the end of Metroid Prime, but maybe there will be a new Metroid series, like, you know,

382
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,360
there was Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero, you know, maybe a new Metroid series.

383
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,720
This is the end of Prime, the beginning of something new, I hope.

384
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,560
I want old school Metroid.

385
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,960
I do too, and I think a lot of people want that, but, I don't know, is it really something

386
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,240
that might sell, or something we're not, or something we would get not on the DS?

387
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
You know what I mean?

388
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,120
Even more though, will it blend?

389
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,840
I think if a new 2D Metroid's going to come out, it's just going to be on the DS, and

390
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,360
that's kind of the bummer about it, is that, you know, yeah, I like the DS and all, but

391
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,640
I like to play the old school games on my TV as well, the big surround sound, you know,

392
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,520
look at some of the games that are 2D, 3D hybrids that were on consoles that were pretty

393
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
good.

394
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,840
Well, Street Fighter IV is a perfect example, right?

395
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,680
2D Fighter, awesome use of 3D in it.

396
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Yeah.

397
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,920
Why couldn't you make a platformer in that kind of vein?

398
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Or a game going back a little bit?

399
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,680
Well, that's what we really got for platformers, and I think LittleBigPlanet.

400
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
That's a great example.

401
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,560
I was going to say Beautiful Joe, even though that's back on the GameCube, but still, you

402
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,520
know, a good example of, you know, 2D platformers.

403
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,680
And Shinagogo.

404
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
They can still be a lot of fun.

405
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Yeah.

406
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,040
Well, if anything, I think that LittleBigPlanet proved that, like, right away.

407
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,680
Reenie says in chat, Metroid Prime 4, you lost your power-ups again, moron.

408
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
I guess that's true.

409
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,960
How many times can we go through the same story of, whoops, lost my power-ups.

410
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,920
Maybe we can use dumb blonde as an excuse.

411
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I don't know.

412
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Yeah, just make it a prequel.

413
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Make it another prequel.

414
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,680
Tigerclaw says the next one will be called Metroid Prime 4, Electric Boogaloo.

415
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
One can hope.

416
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,400
That would only be if, that was what they should have called Metroid Prime 2.

417
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Brad from Pod Culture says Metroid Prime 4, Mission to Moscow.

418
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Who knows?

419
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,240
If you want to join us and chat live on this Sunday evening, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

420
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,720
Well, this is something that I am going to have to get.

421
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:34,900
This is on my must-buy-we list, is they're doing a haunted house simulator.

422
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,480
And it is going to be Ju-On, which is The Grudge.

423
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,560
Yes, as in the same movie, and probably not including Sarah Michelle Gellar.

424
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,040
It already came out in Japan a few weeks ago.

425
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,680
It will be localized, hopefully pre-Halloween.

426
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,560
So hopefully we'll be able to see it, but it's actually, um, as being consulted on it

427
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:02,960
is, um, is Shimizu Takashi, who was the guy who directed, actually, not only the Japanese

428
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,960
version, but he directed the first American one.

429
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,720
The second one is utter shit.

430
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,280
Don't go see it.

431
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,880
Um, but it's basically the, the, you're using the Wiimote as a flashlight on screen and

432
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,280
you go through a warehouse, a mannequin factory, um, a hospital, you know, just basically all

433
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,640
your usual, oh my god, I'm scared places, you know.

434
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Um, but it's supposed to have a twist where you can use your second Wiimote to make in-game

435
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,240
things happen immediately.

436
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:43,640
In fact, the actual quote from this article, and I have to read this, Rob, is to make in-game

437
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,080
events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.

438
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
I like that, and I, there's a YouTube they're promoting this with that just shows a bunch

439
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
of scared people.

440
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,200
Hey, I'm all for scary games that are gonna make me jump out of my seat.

441
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,040
I don't know though, The Grudge, you know, I'm on it.

442
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,240
The first movie was cool, but I've seen the second one, the Japanese movie, I've seen

443
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,960
the, um, the TV movie, uh, Jeff and I were renting movies the other night and they, I

444
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,560
saw The Grudge 3 on DVD and I looked at that and I was like, lol, there's a third one.

445
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Was it American?

446
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,120
Yeah, it was American Grudge 3.

447
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
No.

448
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
Yes.

449
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
No.

450
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Yes.

451
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,760
Unless it said The Grudge 3, I don't know if it was maybe the Japanese one being marketed

452
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,920
as an American one, I don't know, but it was there.

453
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
No.

454
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I crap you not.

455
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,660
Well, I'll have to, the second one's funny cause it's about what's her face doing dirty

456
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,400
things with the main character, it's pretty funny.

457
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,640
Not dirty that way, she's, it's very interesting.

458
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
It's very interesting.

459
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,480
Yeah, 2009 direct to video.

460
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
It came out.

461
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
That is shit.

462
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,400
Stars, uh, Shawnee Smith from the, uh, Saw series is in it.

463
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
Oh, whatever.

464
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,840
There it is.

465
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
The Grudge 3.

466
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I don't know when this came out.

467
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,200
It came out 12th, 12th of May.

468
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
So it just came out.

469
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
It doesn't exist in my universe.

470
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,040
Do you want to hear the plot?

471
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
No.

472
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,400
A young Japanese woman who holds the key to stopping the evil spirit of Kayako travels

473
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,040
to the haunted Chicago apartment from the sequel, dot, dot, dot.

474
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,560
I'm not going to read the rest cause you didn't really want to hear it anyway.

475
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Meh.

476
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,800
Cause you recognized it from any of the Japanese ones.

477
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,800
No, it goes still moved to Chicago from Japan to Chicago.

478
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,800
No, all they have to do is just hop on an airplane.

479
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:32,320
No, the whole, that's someone who completely just knows crap about, you know, hauntings

480
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
and anything.

481
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
They usually stay localized.

482
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,520
Tiger Claw in chat says they tend to milk those movies by creating crappy direct to

483
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
DVD sequels.

484
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Yep.

485
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,520
That's true.

486
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,080
Um, you know, there's a sequel to Donnie Darko that just came out too.

487
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
That was direct to video.

488
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
I haven't watched that yet.

489
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,440
I want to see it's been actually in writing and production for quite a while now and I

490
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
really want to see it.

491
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
Well, Jeff rented that and I was, you know, he wanted to watch it, but I was kinda like,

492
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
I don't remember the first one well enough.

493
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,960
I haven't seen the first one in like 10 years cause seriously, they're making a sequel to

494
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,840
a movie that's like 10 years old.

495
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,200
So I need to just go watch the first one.

496
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Here's my copy right here.

497
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Really?

498
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Add the director's edition.

499
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Yeah.

500
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Right.

501
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie.

502
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,320
And plus, you know, any movie that Drew Barrymore is going to produce and I love Drew Barrymore.

503
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,000
She would be like my secret girlfriend if I could.

504
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

505
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So yeah.

506
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,340
Um, you know, I, uh, I don't know, I, I I'll go watch if it's really that good, like Jeff

507
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,600
can watch it for me and if it's really that good, I'll, he'll watch it again and I can

508
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
see it.

509
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Right.

510
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Yep.

511
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
All right.

512
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Uh, let's see.

513
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,720
What if the ghost wanted some deep dish pizza, but I'm bummed.

514
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,560
I feel like slipping my wrist now I'm bleeding my pain on your face.

515
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,780
That was so Gothic and tragic.

516
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,780
Thank you.

517
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,620
Hey, um, something Nintendo might come after you and slit your wrist and make you a bleed

518
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,440
your pain on their face because Nintendo is pissed about these DS flashcards.

519
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,480
Uh, Loki was talking about it a little bit this week.

520
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,840
Well guess what eBay and Amazon both now have had to stop selling these DS flashcards.

521
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,480
Um, Nintendo is basically, I don't know what they did, but they basically convinced a eBay

522
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,280
and Amazon to stop selling them.

523
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,960
Quote Nintendo is pleased with the cooperation is received from both eBay and Amazon to prevent

524
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,120
the sales of game copying devices.

525
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,560
And that was from Nintendo's global head of anti piracy, Jody dot tree.

526
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:35,240
In an interview with MCV, um, eBay is actually pulling the auctions on this and Amazon got

527
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,600
a notice and take down and all this fun stuff.

528
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,520
So a good luck though, getting all those mom pause stores that still, still sell this,

529
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,360
but still puts a little dent in it and makes it a little bit harder to get.

530
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,560
If you are looking for these cartridges, um, Rini though, and chat says, flashcards are

531
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
a waste of money.

532
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
Hi there.

533
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,240
SD card slot on DSI.

534
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,200
Gold anthro admits the Amazon is where he got his are for.

535
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I don't know.

536
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm not into the hacking thing.

537
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Like a lot of y'all are.

538
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,820
I don't, I don't really have the patience for that stuff.

539
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,240
So I don't really do it.

540
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,880
Um, but I know this is probably a loss to those that were looking forward to the home

541
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
brew.

542
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,180
If you are using it for piracy though, well then, you know, it's hard to feel a little

543
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,160
pity for you, but at least the home brew and all that, as far as all that goes, that is

544
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
kind of a bummer.

545
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,400
So, all right, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

546
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, in other news, we have, uh, some Sega stuff that makes me particularly happy.

547
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,080
Um, going to be coming out, um, for DS and Wii is Jambo Safari, actually.

548
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,240
Um, they are taking the old arcade title and, you know, making it pretty and more modern

549
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,800
looking and having more stuff happen, you know, to make people happy.

550
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,400
Um, there'll be customizable characters and vehicles and you can run a safari park and

551
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,120
help animals in need.

552
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,920
Uh, the DS version, of course, will work with the stylus and the Wii version will have a

553
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,760
lasso gameplay that uses the Wiimote and it's a, you can have a two player and four player

554
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,400
party version, so there will be more.

555
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,440
This is just proof that OLR has friends in high places somewhere, even though they're

556
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,560
not admitting who they are, seriously, who would have thought that Jambo fucking Safari

557
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,720
will get a remake.

558
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,200
This is the best news of the year so far, really.

559
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,800
I am so all about this game.

560
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,200
I just really hope it doesn't suck, but I don't know, Sega's got a pretty good track

561
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,600
record with the remakes.

562
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,960
I'm looking past Sonic because Sonics were like reinventions, but, uh, you know, Sega's

563
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,280
got a pretty good track record otherwise, so I'm really excited about Jambo Safari.

564
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,040
I don't know about you, DarkSakura, are you looking forward to this?

565
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,800
Yeah, pretty much, I like to play the game.

566
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,480
I still want my freaking Planet Harrier, do you hear me, Sega?

567
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Whores.

568
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,980
I mean, I love you.

569
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,400
So I'm excited, I'm hoping that this announcement came out because this is one of the things

570
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,520
that's going to be playable at E3, do you think?

571
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
You think, you think, you think?

572
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
I hope.

573
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I won't be there.

574
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
I know, but I will bring you-

575
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,120
I'm trying not to speculate on-

576
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,320
Maybe they'll have a Jambo keychain I can bring back for you, see?

577
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
There you go.

578
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
That'll be worthwhile.

579
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Exactly, exactly.

580
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,320
Well, hey, we don't know much about Jambo Safari yet, hopefully a little more after

581
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,480
E3, but we do know about some of the games that are coming out this week.

582
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,800
Let's travel around the world and look at this week's release dates.

583
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm going to start with the US, sadly Loki is not here to do US release dates, but I'll

584
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,960
fill in for him tonight.

585
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,920

Treasure, Imagine Boutique Owner comes out this week as well, as well as Space Camp,

588
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,800
which I thought I remembered Loki reading a couple weeks ago, so I don't know if this

589
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,560
game was pushed back or what.

590
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,880
Sadly no, it is not based on the great 80s movie with the same name, so don't get your

591
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
hopes up.

592
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,240
On the personal trainer, Walking, also on the DS this week.

593
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,240

601
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,880
Moving on to the consoles, one release on PS2 this week, it's Secret Agent Clank, and

602
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,360

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,760
That is all that's coming out in the US this week, let's travel over to the UK, Dark Soccer.

607
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,560
For the UK on PS2 we have Secret Agent Clank.

608
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,800
On the 28th we have Inferno Pool and Saints Row 2 Corporate Warfare, and Trash Panic,

609
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:05,040
whatever that is, we have Artanelico, Two Melody of Metafalka, I guess, if I can, Falisa,

610
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
I guess?

611
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
I can't read it.

612
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
My brain doesn't work.

613
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,680
Is Trash Panic what my mother does when I leave a Coke can on the table because I forgot

614
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,480
to throw it away or what have you, or got lazy and just walked away?

615
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
That sounds like what it is.

616
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
Maybe.

617
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Trash Panic.

618
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Don't worry, mama will clean it.

619
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,200
On the 29th, Boom Blocks Bash Party, Brain Exercise with Dr. Kaleishima, and Fuel and

620
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:33,360
Virtua Tennis 2009, PDC World Championship Darts, and Valhalla Knights 2 on PSP.

621
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,160
Looking at the Japanese release dates on the Xbox 360 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Empires

622
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,920
comes out in both Japan and the general Asian regions.

623
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,960
This is Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires, basically, is what this is, your version of that.

624
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,560
Coming out in other places, I'm sorry, coming out on other consoles in the same place, Infamous

625
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,520
comes out in Asian regions, but it's not quite out in Japan this week.

626
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,360
However, Shin Sangoku Musou 5 comes out as well on the Playstation 3, and Agra Senki comes

627
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,600
out with a price reduction this week, down to $44.90.

628
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,960
Also a game called The Last Guy comes out from Sony computers themselves.

629
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,440
I am not sure, this is an action game, I'm not sure what this is a port of, but it looks

630
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,680
to be some type of shooter game, but what's kind of cool about it, it looks like it uses

631
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Google Earth.

632
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,560
Like, seriously, doesn't the backgrounds here look like something you'd see in Google Earth?

633
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,560
Yeah, a bit.

634
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,560
That's kind of cool about it.

635
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
That's pretty cool.

636
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Yeah.

637
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
So that comes out this week.

638
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,360
And looking on other consoles, going over to the Nintendo Wii, just one release this

639
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:45,360
week, Ogon no Kizuna comes out this week, which is not a game I've heard of.

640
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,260
It looks kind of similar to a Dynasty Warriors-ish type of game, but with a little more role-playing

641
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,620
elements mixed in, so check that out if you'd like.

642
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,640
On the Playstation 2, the Grand Theft Auto games get a price reduction this week, that's

643
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,180
something I look forward to in Japan.

644
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:07,180
On the Nintendo DS, Claymore, Gengan no Majo comes out this week, as well as Days of Memories

645
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:14,100
3 from SNK, Gaya Kukuten Kenji comes out as well, has a premium edition release as well

646
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,560
from Capcom, oh, you know what that is?

647
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,180
That's Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.

648
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:24,040
You know what, Rob, I do have to say that your Japanese is improving greatly.

649
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,600
At least this show's been good for something, huh?

650
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Yeah.

651
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:35,880
Also, on the Nintendo DS, one more release for you from Sega, Suzumiya Haruhi no Shokurietsu.

652
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,200
It's a melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

653
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
That's what it is.

654
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,880
It's maids, is what this looks to be.

655
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,120
No, it's their school club, and Haruhi actually has a really good time dressing up the really

656
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,320
pretty girl up in bunny suits and different things to get stuff done for their club.

657
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,280
Well, there you go, bunny suit, to your heart's content this week.

658
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
They're school girls.

659
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Because Haruhi is God.

660
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,040
No, actually, she is.

661
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,520
That's the premise of the story, she's God.

662
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,640
Quickly looking at the PSP release dates, Ghost in the Shell, oh, these are all movies.

663
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,840
I don't see any games this week.

664
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,920
Bamboo Blade is the only game it looks to be this week, so check that out if you'd like.

665
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
There you go, that's it for Japanese release dates.

666
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,580
Let's go back into some gaming news and talk about some music that's been licensed for

667
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,920
an upcoming Q Entertainment game.

668
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,960
Kind of interesting about this, apparently, Tiesto and BT songs have been licensed for

669
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,240
this new game from Q Entertainment.

670
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,400
The game is called QJ, based on some, I guess some folks have been digging around some of

671
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,760
the licensing information sites, the songs that were licensed.

672
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,440
Love Comes Again from Tiesto.

673
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
So there you go.

674
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,400
I don't know much about this, but if it's Q Entertainment, then it's Mizuguchi, and

675
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,120
I love him.

676
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,000
There's very few games he's put out that I haven't liked, and I'm even counting 99 Nights.

677
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,240
I forgave that game's shortcomings, just because I'm a whore for Tetsuya Mizuguchi games.

678
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,420
So there you go.

679
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,600
More about this game, hopefully at E3, hopefully.

680
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Fingers crossed.

681
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,840
Well, what we have for the PlayStation Network is we do have some updates.

682
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,480
We have some demos of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, Killzone 2, Bullet

683
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,720
4D Interactive AD, whatever, Red Faction, Guerrilla, Multiplayer, and Infamous, which

684
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
I sold a commercial for today.

685
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,600
I was like, dude, is this Comic Zone?

686
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,160
PS3 game content, Riddick Dark Athena Premium Multiplayer Pack.

687
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,960
We've got some more for Fear 2, Tom Clancy's Hawks, Pain, Modistore Pacific Rift, Little

688
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,360
Big Planet, a bunch of stuff for Little Big Planet.

689
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,000
Guitar Hero World Tour, the European track, Rock Band Alice Cooper Pack.

690
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That's cool.

691
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,320
Rock Band Taking Back Sunday, and Kids Don't Follow by the Replacements.

692
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,960
For PSP games, we have Fading Shadows and Creatures Raised in Space.

693
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,720
Creatures Raised in Space?

694
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
Amazing.

695
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,280
I actually logged into Home this week.

696
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,440
That's one other game, quote unquote, I played.

697
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,640
Boy, that, Home is really expanding.

698
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:17,300
Say what you will about, you know, whether Home is a game or any fun, all with quotes,

699
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,760
but they're sure pouring a lot of expansions into it, which I guess is kind of cool.

700
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,720
It seems like you have a lot of new stuff to explore if you haven't used it in a while.

701
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,520
So props to them for that.

702
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,860
Like there's a new like area that you can go to where I guess they're going to do like

703
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,160
announcements inside Home.

704
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,440
Like there's a big giant screen in there, but it has like this weird jungle theme to

705
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
it.

706
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
I don't know.

707
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
I thought it was kind of interesting.

708
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
So we'll see.

709
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,040
Before I get to the next story, this chat comment made me lol.

710
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,420
Renee asks, Sky, here's a question.

711
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,480
Is Cooking Mama a MILF?

712
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,540
Please answer very important.

713
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,600
Is Cooking Mama a MILF?

714
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Lord, no.

715
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Yeah.

716
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
I unfortunately would have to say no.

717
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
She's too prudish.

718
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
That's why she's in the kitchen.

719
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,320
She's always in the kitchen and never in the bedroom.

720
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,240
Here you go, ba-dum-bum.

721
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,120
Moving on with some more news, talking about Sony and, well, it looks like Sony is going

722
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,360
to be threatening to sue companies that are publishing images of the PS3.

723
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,680
Remember we were talking about this last week?

724
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,360
We had some images leak out of the new PS3.

725
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,840
Well, apparently, Sony has been demanding that these companies stop doing this.

726
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,440
I know this all started from, I guess, their Taiwanese branch or something.

727
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,960
But dude, when you've threatened to sue, doesn't it kind of prove that the story is true?

728
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,680
That was my first thought, is like, well, way to give it away, right?

729
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,400
I mean, otherwise, wouldn't they just release that good old-fashioned line of, oh, Sony

730
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,080
will not comment on rumors and speculation at this time.

731
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,560
Look for our E3 speech.

732
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,800
But if you stick the lawyers on them, doesn't it kind of prove it to be true?

733
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Maybe I'm crazy.

734
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,600
Well, how about some, I guess, happier news?

735
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:10,480
We are actually going to be getting some PlayStation 1 classic games for the PS1 Classic Store.

736
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,880
We have been getting information from the ESRB because you know how they love sleek

737
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,440
stuff and five games are supposed to be coming to the online service.

738
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,800
We have, among them, Resident Evil Director's Cut and Metal Gear Solid.

739
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,320
Also among those rated is Special Ops Covert Assault and Ranger Elite and Tom Clancy's

740
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
Rainbow Six.

741
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,960
So that's pretty cool.

742
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,760
But dude, Metal freaking Gear and Resident Evil Director's Cut, I will have to go along

743
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,120
with all the bad voice acting because I can quote that game, you know.

744
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
What is it?

745
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,080
I hope this is not Chris's blood.

746
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,480
Maybe the hidden porn chat will be kind of embedded in the game somewhere.

747
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Who knows?

748
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Because remember that?

749
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
There's YouTube out there where they mix and match all the dialogue into something disgusting.

750
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
You know what that was?

751
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,220
I'm going to tell you this because I know how you can do it.

752
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,680
There was a file reader that let you read the audio and video files off of PlayStation

753
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,200
games, because I don't know if you remember, back in the day, the first MP3s out for Bus

754
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
to Move 2.

755
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,480
Sorry, I did those.

756
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,600
You know, on my old website, I was the first person that I saw that I noticed that had

757
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,240
them online right after the game came out.

758
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:34,320
But there's a little reader program that you can get to pull, to rip the files off and

759
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,000
then just record them, you know, convert them to WAV or whatever and record them or whatever.

760
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,800
So that's actually how they pulled this off.

761
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,960
That's also how they got the thing about Maria in Castlevania, where an ending they didn't

762
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,840
put into the game of her actually being taken over by the succubus.

763
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,040
So you can find out it was a lot easier to find stuff on the old readers.

764
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,720
Apparently it sounds like that way.

765
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,760
So what does somebody just kind of dump all the dialogue and then edit it together?

766
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,860
I mean, that's pretty impressive, but you could also kind of like, you could dump the

767
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,000
audio like we used to do this, like to get some of the DDR songs off the home versions

768
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
of the game.

769
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
That was only when they were mixing audio.

770
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,280
Right, but no, I'm saying after that, we used to rip them by hooking them through the mixing

771
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
board.

772
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
I'm surprised people didn't do that.

773
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,920
Yeah, there was, you could still also pull them off doing the, was it, it wasn't RA,

774
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,360
it was like SX or SA reader or something?

775
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,360
I don't remember.

776
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,920
But yeah, I used to do that back in the day.

777
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,040
This was really easy to do those.

778
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Hmm.

779
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,360
All right, well, apparently there's a lot of rumbling going on about what's going on

780
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:49,080
at E3 and possibly a new version of Metal Gear Solid apparently being rumored right

781
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
now.

782
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,000
And a lot of this has to do with the teaser graphic that showed up on the Kojima Productions

783
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,040
website.

784
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,920
Apparently what's going on is that something is being listed in next week's Famitsu that

785
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,160
the PSP and the PS3 apparently is indicating a new Metal Gear is going to be coming out.

786
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,240
Now, is that Metal Gear Solid 5 or some other type of Metal Gear game in the same vein?

787
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Who knows?

788
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,840
But some rumors about the teaser graphic is that the outline was actually showing a 5.

789
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,200
I'm actually kind of surprised.

790
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,360
I saw that too.

791
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:23,400
Yeah, I'm surprised if this is Metal Gear Solid 5 because it seems kind of soon.

792
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,320
Is it just me or does it seem like 4 hasn't really been out long enough?

793
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,680
Am I crazy?

794
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,880
I don't know.

795
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,240
But you know, between the magazine, Famitsu magazine, E3 coming up next week with this

796
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,480
countdown seems to be pointing to, and all this, I mean, if there's a time to make a

797
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,960
big announcement, I suppose this will be it.

798
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,440
But you know, I don't know, it just seems too soon for Metal Gear Solid 5.

799
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,240
Another type of Metal Gear Solid game?

800
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,440
Like a new online one or, you know, I don't know, even heck, a new acid game is just coming

801
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,840
to PSP as well?

802
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,840
I don't know.

803
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,560
Is there anything you're hoping it is, Dark Sakura?

804
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
I don't know.

805
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,800
Do you think, is it just me or does it seem too soon for 5?

806
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
I don't know.

807
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
I don't know.

808
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,400
Because you know how while the market is, you know, struck while the iron's hot, pretty

809
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
much?

810
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,520
I really don't want to put any speculation on it.

811
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,000
I really don't.

812
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,240
Because I build myself way too much up to be too excited about something.

813
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,720
I want to wait for something a little bit more concrete before I make my judgment.

815
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,960
ActDeaf says, the countdown is a countdown for a countdown for a countdown for a countdown.

816
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,640
Yeah, I'm getting kind of sick of that crap too.

817
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
You know what I mean?

818
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Just announce it.

819
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,040
Announce it or don't.

820
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,380
One countdown to a big announcement might be okay.

821
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,780
But counting down to another countdown is stupid.

822
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,600
Very stupid.

823
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,120
One Night Stands in Chat says, was the 5 outline a definite 5 or could it have been an S?

824
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
Very good comment.

825
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,040
Some people are speculating it might have been an S. So maybe it's a new like Metal

826
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,160
Gear Solid S type game or something.

827
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,200
Let me look at it for a second.

828
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:08,900
It was kind of like, well it's one of those like fonts where it's very like pixelated.

829
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,960
So it could be a 5 or an S. Very easy.

830
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,340
Let me have a look if it loads.

831
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,340
It's not loading.

832
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,340
My computer is being a butthole.

833
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
Trust me.

834
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,840
It could be either one.

835
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Let's see.

836
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,020
Other comments, Alpha Cananagram in Chat says, it's just an announcement.

837
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Which is true.

838
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,020
It's only an announcement.

839
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,960
It's not something we should get too excited about.

840
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,920
So there you go.

841
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,840
Well how about something that might be worth getting excited about.

842
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:42,240
I mean if you don't have iTunes or an iPhone I guess.

843
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,440
PSP and maybe having a music download service.

844
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,280
Sony's been thinking about it.

845
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,960
They released a survey in January to check for consumer interest.

846
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:59,320
So it seems that they are considering on having other recording companies work with them.

847
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,880
And Sony, they have their own music division.

848
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,780
But they're just thinking about it right now.

849
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:10,480
So they might have a digital music download but maybe not.

850
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
It might happen.

851
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
They're thinking about it.

852
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,760
They're sending their little slimy tentacles out to feel for it.

853
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,200
I'm kind of surprised it's one of those things they haven't been thinking about for quite

854
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
some time.

855
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
You know what I mean?

856
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Like I don't know.

857
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,320
A lot of, again I use the whole college kid thing.

858
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,200
Who do PSP's sell best to?

859
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
College kids.

860
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,720
To replace iPods because they do everything else like games and the internet and all this.

861
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,720
So it kind of seems like one of those things that I'm surprised they didn't do this a long

862
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
freaking time ago.

863
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,320
Especially when you consider the fact, what else does Sony have?

864
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,560
A big music label, right?

865
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,800
So why is this taking so long?

866
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:52,560
Sony's got a big, they're big stinky tentacle fingers in the music industry so why not?

867
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,280
I just think though that they tend to behave a bit conservatively when they don't need

868
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,440
to.

869
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,680
Have you noticed that?

870
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,840
Eh, I guess a little bit.

871
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,400
They'll venture out into something that they think is innovative and new but with something

872
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,760
that they see as tried and true.

873
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,040
They're like, ehhh, I don't wanna.

874
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
They're doing it.

875
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,040
I don't wanna.

876
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:20,120
Alpha Canonogram in chat says, Sky they did, it was called Connect, the ATRAC Atorac 3

877
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,760
store which closed down.

878
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,200
They were planning on doing it.

879
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Hmm, interesting.

880
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,200
I don't remember that.

881
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,480
Was that something for just the PSP specifically?

882
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,200
Or was that something to, you know, there were like a million people that were gonna

883
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,120
launch something to compete with iTunes and very few of them succeeded.

884
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,360
I mean you could say that Napster somewhat succeeded because it's a different business

885
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
model.

886
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,280
I think the biggest competition for iTunes has probably been, what, Amazon.com maybe?

887
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,200
But I mean, what else is out there that's successfully competed with iTunes?

888
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,240
And when I say successfully, carries a market share even one tenth the size of what Apple

889
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
has.

890
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
No.

891
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
No one.

892
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
It's practically a monopoly on Apple's part.

893
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
Yeah, so and that's what they're kind of saying there in chat.

894
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,060
So is this something new that maybe is trying to launch and Alpha Canonogram confirms Connect

895
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,060
with Sony's iTunes.

896
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,320
Okay, well a million people tried to launch something to compete with iTunes and they

897
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,600
all failed because none of them stood out.

898
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,240
It was too much competition amongst each other and iTunes already had the, you know, they

899
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,140
had the player to go with the store.

900
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,920
But also, oh I want to read this comment from Marissa Congusto in chat.

901
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,100
Yes, that's right, it's Marissa.

902
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,280
My dad thought he was doing me a big favor getting me a mini disc player instead of an

903
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,980
iPod ages ago, facepalm.

904
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,980
That's alright.

905
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,980
I feel your pain.

906
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,980
I want a mini disc player.

907
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,980
I have an HD DVD player.

908
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,520
I actually want a mini disc player pretty badly, they do some good things with mini

909
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
discs.

910
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
Really?

911
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,800
It's still, I think somewhat supported in Japan.

912
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Huh.

913
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Weird.

914
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,440
But you know, it's another example where Sony's tried to go, huh, we're going to do all this

915
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
new stuff.

916
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,240
I mean, Betamax, Betamax was better, mini disc was great, but the first thing that they've

917
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,860
done in a long time that really caught on, I think like that was Blu-ray.

918
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,240
One Night Stands in Chat asks, wasn't Zune a competitor for iTunes?

919
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Zune was a competitor for the iPod, and certainly Microsoft launched their own store to go with

920
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,560
it, but it didn't really go, you know, one could argue with me whether it was successful

921
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,640
or not, but I think it's pretty clear iTunes has by far the most dominant share.

922
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
You know what I mean?

923
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,260
Like it hasn't really put a blip on the radar of what iTunes has.

924
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,360
So whether they're still supporting that whole Microsoft marketplace or what, I don't know.

925
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,160
But we'll see.

926
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,760
Well how about some happy, happy, happy news?

927
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,720
Just a moment, let me talk about this PSP rental service here real quick.

928
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,680
There was a PSP survey that was hinting that a rental service might be on its way to the

929
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,760
PSP, which is kind of interesting because we know that the PSP, you know, there's this

930
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,360
new PSP coming out that nobody's confirming, but we all know it's probably happening, it's

931
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:55,060
going to be announced at E3 this year, that's a discless PSP.

932
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,040
It's kind of interesting, one thing they're thinking about doing is a rental service,

933
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,000
and this is something that I guess was hinted at by a survey that came out recently that

934
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,920
Sony's doing to market to see the potential for a rental service.

935
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,240
Wouldn't that be interesting?

936
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:15,660
I don't think we've ever seen anything like this in the years of video gaming, where instead

937
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,560
of a company boo-hooing and yelling and bitching and screaming about blockbusters and Hollywood

938
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,960
videos and places that rent video games and how they chip into game sales, a company deciding

939
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,560
to, well hell, we'll do game rentals of our own.

940
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,040
If you can't beat them, join them, and we'll compete with them directly.

941
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,120
Very interesting, if this actually happens, that could be kind of interesting, I mean

942
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,120
why not?

943
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:46,960
Apple has proved that it can happen with the movies on iTunes, why not rent games through

944
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,980
a similar service?

945
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,320
This could be big if it's true, you know, it's all kind of a big grain of salt right

946
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,560
now because a survey isn't the official word, but it could be very interesting.

947
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,200
Well, it could be.

948
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,720
Alright, that's all I had.

949
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,920
Well, I did have my happy news.

950
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Sure!

951
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,080
It has been confirmed!

952
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,200
We are getting Tatsunoko vs Capcom in the US.

953
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:18,260
The Nintendo power scan was true, and Capcom said on their Twitter that Tatsunoko vs Capcom

954
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:27,120
is being localized for a US release, well US, Canada, North America, whatever.

955
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:32,440
And the quote says, Cat is officially out of the bag on Capcom Mystery Game number 1

956
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,480
and linked to the scan.

957
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,040
And then there was also one made by Capcom Unity on their blog.

958
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,480
But there's one more mystery game they should be having at E3, so I hope it doesn't suck.

959
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:50,160
That Arinean chat is yelling out with online and bug fixes, god I hope that's true.

960
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,800
Why not, especially if it's true they have to cut back a few characters, well then hell,

961
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,800
let's make it better!

962
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,360
But the characters that were listed on there aren't even in the damn game anyway.

963
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,040
Oh, oh yeah, we had some back and forth last week on whether those characters were really

964
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
going to be there or not.

965
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,520
The only gachamon characters that were in the game is Ken and June.

966
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,520
Joe wasn't in it.

967
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,640
If Joe was in it, I'd be screaming, because I'd want him in the release.

968
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:20,920
Arinean chat says, Sky mystery game number 2 is Mega Man Legends 3 on Wii.

969
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,920
God I hope you're, if you're lying to me, so help me god, that would be amazing though

970
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,120
if that's the mystery game.

971
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,080
I would love that.

972
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,320
But it seems like it's all speculation to me.

973
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,440
We'll see.

974
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,240
By the way, we were talking about the Zune earlier, and we actually have some news about

975
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,880
the Zune, including some leaked images of what is supposed to be the Zune X, which I

976
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,400
guess you could think of as, you know, Microsoft's little competitor to the iPhone.

977
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,560
We talked about this a little bit last week.

978
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,600
Apparently yeah, some new images have come out, and I guess the best way I could describe

979
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,620
this, since this is radio and I can't really show you the images, is it looks kind of like

980
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,680
a scaled down PSP.

981
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,600
Very rectangular in shape though, not that round shape, and you definitely have the four

982
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,600
buttons there on the side.

983
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,740
It's just four buttons and a crosshair, and it looks like what's, I'm sorry, the cross

984
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,140
pad, and definitely what looks to be some shoulder buttons.

985
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,900
I don't know though, kind of take this with a grain of salt, but if some of this is to

986
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,840
be believed, then this could be pretty cool.

987
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:19,280
Again, this is supposed to have a micro SD slot, SIM card tray, support for Bluetooth

988
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,840
headphones in it, some optical digital output in there as well.

989
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:28,640
Apparently it will actually work with Zune X originals, Xbox Live and on live ready game

990
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,640
streaming.

991
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,360
There'll be a 32 gigabyte flash drive, and the battery is built in and rechargeable.

992
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,360
And it will bake scones.

993
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,060
It just well might.

994
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:39,060
And run Linux.

995
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,060
So we'll see.

996
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,280
Maybe there will be more info about this at E3.

997
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,040
I dare whoever gets one of these to put Linux on it.

998
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,400
That'll make me go squee for a little bit.

999
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,480
Well, this is something that probably won't make people squee, although to be completely

1000
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,000
honest, I don't think anyone will really freaking give a damn.

1001
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,400
Watchmen The End is Nigh, the second episode of it is not coming out for PC, and sad trombone

1002
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,440
I guess.

1003
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:13,400
It will come out on Xbox 360 and PS3, but of course it's also going to be selling like

1004
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:20,200
a special edition that has this and the first episode on it.

1005
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,000
Warner is doing the Watchmen The End is Nigh Complete Experience.

1006
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,600
It has the PS3 versions and the director's cut of the film on Blu-ray.

1007
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,560
So maybe that'll be worth buying, because the movie was freaking good, but meh, the

1008
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:37,080
rest of it, meh, who cares?

1009
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,880
I can fart better games.

1010
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,200
Well, somebody out there might care, you don't know.

1011
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,000
Maybe.

1012
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,920
Question in the chat room that I kind of like, and this is a very unpronounceable name and

1013
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:56,500
I'm sorry, but rlbx327 asks, how would the new PSP work if a person does not have an

1014
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
internet connection?

1015
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,080
How would that work?

1016
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,000
That's a great question, one that we'd all like to know the answer to as well, I'm hoping

1017
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,840
we'll get some results at E3.

1018
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,400
I don't know if maybe you can take it into a game store and buy things that way, but

1019
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,560
I guess the assumption is everybody has an internet connection at this point.

1020
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,280
It's like the DS download stations, could be something similar?

1021
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
I guess.

1022
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,840
I mean, there's definitely ways around it, but I think they just assume everybody has

1023
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:24,160
an internet connection, and even dial up if you have to, but who has dial up anymore?

1024
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,200
I guess, well I shouldn't say that, because there'll be somebody that sends me a message.

1025
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:33,640
Me, I have dial up, my parents have dial up, but geez, my iPod 3G's faster than their internet

1026
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,440
at home on dial up, but I guess some areas still aren't wired for broadband, but I guess

1027
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:46,120
you could still use a PSP Go on dial up, but maybe Sony is only marketing to those people

1028
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,760
that have internet connections.

1029
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,720
I mean, let's face it, a vast portion of the population has an internet connection that's

1030
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,720
fast.

1031
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,440
If every one of them bought a PSP Go, they would do very well, so why bother catering

1032
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,760
to those that don't have an internet connection, right?

1033
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,720
Yeah, well, this is the modern world, everyone's supposed to be connected.

1034
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,640
Super X-Link in chat has an interesting comment, go to a free Wi-Fi spot.

1035
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,280
Remember when, I think it was Nintendo did that at all the McDonalds, the McDonalds or

1036
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,280
something like that?

1037
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:20,400
I don't remember, so, anyhow, some more stories involving Capcom, actually, and talking about

1038
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
E3.

1039
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,280
Apparently, it is going around that Capcom of Japan is apparently going to be pulling

1040
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,280
out of E3.

1041
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,400
Now, this doesn't mean that Capcom is not going to have a booth or anything like that,

1042
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,080
it just means that the international travel looks to be pulling out of E3.

1043
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,100
This is due to concern over, guess what, swine flu.

1044
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,480
That's right, apparently the Japanese branch of the company, they are not committing fully

1045
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:49,800
to attending the E3, they are still contemplating what to do about the swine flu outbreak that's

1046
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:56,360
going on in Keihanshin, which is where Capcom's main office is in Japan.

1047
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,620
Very interesting, and what they're already saying is that because of this, Dead Rising

1048
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,800
2 is not going to be showing up at E3.

1049
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:06,760
Capcom has confirmed that Dead Rising 2 is not going to be there at E3.

1050
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,280
And this has to do with Japanese government restrictions and the advisory in Japan right

1051
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,500
now.

1052
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:19,780
By the way, doesn't just end there, Square, Koei, also not attending E3 from their Japanese

1053
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,640
branches because of, apparently, swine flu concerns.

1054
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:29,160
A quote from an article on gamepolitics.com, quote, Square Enix has canceled plans for

1055
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,460
its Kingdom Hearts team to attend the show, whilst Koei has confirmed that an unspecified

1056
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,920
number of its Japanese employees will not be traveling to the event.

1057
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,120
That's sad face.

1058
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,760
Very, very sad.

1059
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,880
And also incredibly freaking stupid.

1060
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,060
It is incredibly stupid to still be concerned about the swine flu, my god.

1061
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,640
How many people contracted swine flu, like what, 800?

1062
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,640
How many people died?

1063
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,640
10?

1064
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,380
Yeah, maybe 10 at most, but there was a couple, granted there was a couple thousand that got

1065
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,360
swine flu, but how many people get regular flu?

1066
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,360
All the time!

1067
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,840
Fucking shit.

1068
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,800
This is a mass hysteria pandemic thing to sell flu masks and get people to think about

1069
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,240
something other than the war or something, you know?

1070
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,380
It's just stupid.

1071
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,380
It's fabricated.

1072
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,380
It's fabricated.

1073
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:16,720
There's been outbreaks of swine flu before, and it did just about as much damage.

1074
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,280
The only reason it did more damage is because we had less medical technology to deal with

1075
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,280
it.

1076
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,280
Seriously.

1077
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,520
I'm just, ugh.

1078
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,320
So the fact that stupid swine flu or H1N1 or whatever the fuck you want to call it is

1079
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
ruining E3.

1080
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Fuck people.

1081
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:51,000
I say we dedicate the FUs of the week to this.

1082
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,880
My FU of the week goes to just those stupid people who are willing to believe any and

1083
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:01,680
everything that they see on TV, on the internet, you gullible, gullible fucking sheep.

1084
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,560
I hope you get swine flu.

1085
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,720
Just get it.

1086
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:13,800
I hope you get swine flu of the colon and can do nothing but shit viruses or something.

1087
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
That's what I wish.

1088
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,000
I love you stupid people.

1089
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Wow.

1090
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Swine.

1091
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,960
And also I want Dick Cheney to shut up.

1092
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,280
And I just want, I just want people to shut up.

1093
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,480
I want people to just shut up.

1094
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Stop it.

1095
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,480
Knock it the fuck off.

1096
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,320
Knock it the fuck off.

1097
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,320
Swine flu.

1098
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,320
YouTube.

1099
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
No, I'm kidding.

1100
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,320
No, seriously.

1101
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,640
I just want people to think for themselves, to think intelligently.

1102
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,640
And really I want all of those networks, especially Fox news, may they burn in hell forever.

1103
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,640
I want, I want them to, I want real news on my TV.

1104
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,640
I want real news.

1105
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,520
I want what's actually going on in the world.

1106
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,440
I want to know what's going on outside of America.

1107
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,480
Do you hear me CNN?

1108
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:08,200
That's why BBC news, BBC America's news owns yours completely and utterly.

1109
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,200
Sorry.

1110
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
It just does.

1111
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,200
And I like CNN.

1112
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,800
I like CNN much better than Fox news because Fox news is the, the shit that rats shit.

1113
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,800
Okay.

1114
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:23,120
It's like the, the feces of slugs and I hate slugs.

1115
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,360
You know, you get more accuracy.

1116
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,000
You should have a political talk show.

1117
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,120
I have a blog whenever I post on it, but I mean, seriously, it's like, I think it's completely

1118
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,920
sad to find out anything that's actually going on in America and in the world.

1119
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,440
I have to go to BBC.

1120
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:47,520
It should be CNN or one of the good networks reporting our shit properly.

1121
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:57,360
So a big, big finger to our American media, a big finger to the gullible people who believe

1122
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
it.

1123
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:07,400
You know, I have a, I have a magnet on my door of my refrigerator that says, um, bless

1124
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,080
them to the effect of respect people that seek the truth, doubt those who find it.

1125
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,080
Wow.

1126
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,960
Can I talk now?

1127
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
Yeah.

1128
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,560
Uh, I actually don't have a lot, so that's fine.

1129
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
You went a little long.

1130
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
Does not really have anything.

1131
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,120
My FU goes to drama.

1132
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,940
I just, I'm sick of it and I choose not to be around it, so whatever.

1133
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,120
I got better things to do.

1134
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,420
That's right.

1135
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,120
Better things.

1136
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,200
That's it for the FUs of the week.

1137
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,840
How about something a little more pleasant, uh, even though this might drive us to some

1138
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,840
FUs too.

1139
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,640
Apparently our mailbag is quite thin this week and that's very sad.

1140
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,160
Uh, mailbag orange laundry.com is the place to send your emails and one of the only dark

1141
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,720
soccer will read them as she'll do right now.

1142
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,720
What?

1143
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,600
We have like one, two, maybe one actually that came in while we were broadcasting cheeseburger.

1144
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,600
All right.

1145
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,640
Hey guys, I'm curious about your opinions on the new Star Trek movie.

1146
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,880
I've seen it three times in a theater.

1147
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,720
I'm 15 and I'm obsessed with Star Wars, but I never really saw anything in Star Trek.

1148
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,640
I saw the movie two weeks ago with no expectations because I've never experienced anything Star

1149
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,640
Trek before.

1150
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,080
I was blown away and it was the first movie I had ever gone to where everyone clapped

1151
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,080
at the end.

1152
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,400
Actually, all three times I saw that people clapped.

1153
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,720
Um, I knew I wanted to see it again as I was leaving the theater, which I did yesterday

1154
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,120
and plan to again next week.

1155
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,780
I plan on buying the old shows and movies on eBay to catch up on some of the older stuff.

1156
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,760
I have researched some stuff about the movie and I'd like to say, uh, red shirt guy dies

1157
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
if you know what that means.

1158
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,760
You're awesome.

1159
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,600
If you don't go look it up, it's not really a spoiler, just something they threw in from

1160
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
the old series.

1161
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Dude.

1162
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,000
I will give you the rule right now.

1163
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,280
If you're wearing a red shirt and no one knows who you are, you are going to die.

1164
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,640
You know, next generation is yellow, but security officers die.

1165
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,640
Red shirt.

1166
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,960
In fact, they sell on ThinkGeek a red, a red ringer t-shirt that says expendable on it

1167
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,960
in the Star Trek font.

1168
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,960
Nice.

1169
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,040
Um, I will go ahead and say something and I've said this before.

1170
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,440
I was not a Trekkie originally.

1171
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,880
I was a Whovian.

1172
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:09,240
I grew up watching Doctor Who on PBS and not watching Star Trek.

1173
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,400
Although I've seen a number of the original episodes and almost all of next generation

1174
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,400
and maybe a smattering here of DS9 and, uh, you know, Voyager.

1175
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,200
And I watched three episodes of Enterprise and decided it was shit, but there are references

1176
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,240
to all the other series all throughout the movie.

1177
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:33,200
Like, um, I was just saying, you know, like the scene where they go into, you know, the,

1178
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,440
the Delta Vega, you know, place and there's a Tribble just sitting there going, hi, I'm

1179
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:44,600
a Tribble and you know, it's, I actually, you know, I purchased something recently that

1180
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,840
was like the best four episodes of Star Trek ever, the original series, and they're great

1181
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
episodes.

1182
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,240
And I want to say, if you want to get a feel for the original series that will give you

1183
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,760
a decent smattering of what to expect, just get this.

1184
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:06,400
It's four episodes and among them are, um, the, one of them is, uh, Trouble with Tribbles,

1185
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,880
which is supposed to be like the big favorite and I love that episode.

1186
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:18,720
And also, um, it's just fantastic, but yeah, go, go get some of those little samples first,

1187
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,400
see how you feel about it.

1188
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,280
Um, I like next generation going back and watching a bunch of it though, you're going

1189
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,640
to find it really dated.

1190
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,920
The old stuff will hold up because you expect it to be old, but next generation we're talking

1191
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,840
about when I was, you know, early high school, which next generation now, believe it or not,

1192
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,160
is getting to be 20 years old.

1193
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,160
Yeah.

1194
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,160
Like, Oh boy.

1195
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,800
But, um, DS9, you know, I didn't watch much of it.

1196
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,080
I'm actually going to be going back and watching a bunch of it just because from what I understand

1197
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,400
is probably the best of the series.

1198
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,660
Um, Voyager has its ups and downs.

1199
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,660
I've seen crap episodes.

1200
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,480
I've seen great episodes and yeah, I'm sorry, Jerry Ryan is hot.

1201
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,480
Um, but Enterprise is like, I keep expecting Scott Bakula to jump.

1202
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,480
I'm sorry to leap.

1203
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,360
Cause he was, you know, from Quantum Leap.

1204
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,920
I do want to remind though, Jerry Ryan didn't show up till season four.

1205
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,920
I know.

1206
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:07,920
That's right.

1207
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,680
Um, by the way, Star Trek, me personally loved it.

1208
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,680
Loved the movie.

1209
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,680
Thought it was great.

1210
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:17,920
It was, um, you know, it definitely kind of JJ Abrams definitely said, I am fucking turning

1211
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,600
this car around right the fuck now and taking it a new direction, but it needed it.

1212
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,920
It needed it.

1213
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,720
I hope we get a new series out of it.

1214
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,560
I mean, even if the series isn't related to the movie, I hope it invigorates interest

1215
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:35,200
in Star Trek enough that we do get the Uber nerdy series in the Voyager next generation

1216
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,560
deep space nine cannon.

1217
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,840
Like, I want to see a new show like that.

1218
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,840
That's not enterprise.

1219
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:45,080
I actually, I'll tell you what they've confirmed, um, uh, writing on the sequel now and got

1220
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,360
the whole cast.

1221
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,360
And I'm, don't get me wrong.

1222
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,960
I'm, I'm thrilled about that too, but where's my weekly dose.

1223
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,240
You know, I want to see that too.

1224
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,480
That would be very exciting.

1225
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,040
I don't think I could watch the movie a million times in the theater.

1226
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,240
Like dark soccer does.

1227
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,520
Maybe I'd see it one more time, but, uh, I'll just buy it on Blu-ray when it comes out.

1228
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,760
I think I might do what, uh, dark soccer is suggesting though and get the, uh, uh, episodes

1229
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,760
sampling.

1230
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,760
Cause you're right.

1231
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,720
I saw those on, uh, what I'm done with it.

1232
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,320
I have the one with the four episodes on it.

1233
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:15,000
I also want to, I really want the next generation movies on Blu-ray.

1234
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,440
No disrespect to the old movies, but I really want the next generation ones.

1235
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:24,640
Cause I went and saw every single one of those in the theater, but I always loved the next

1236
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,640
generation.

1237
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,120
Who is your favorite character in all of Star Trek?

1238
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,760
Well, I have to do it by, by season.

1239
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,760
Sorry.

1240
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,720
So original season, um, well in the movie, I'm going to say right now, Scotty, cause

1241
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
I'm sorry.

1242
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,880
I love Simon Pegg between him and Carl Urban.

1243
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,320
I'm sorry that that made the movie for me.

1244
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:48,720
His, Carl Urban's McCoy was perfect and oh my God, ah, Southern guy, he just did the

1245
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,720
accent and everything.

1246
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,720
Just right.

1247
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,720
It made me really happy.

1248
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:55,160
But, but Simon Pegg as Scotty was just like, actually he was probably my favorite in the

1249
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,120
original series too.

1250
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,840
Yeah.

1251
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Next generation.

1252
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
It depends.

1253
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:07,800
Cause as a kid, I was that age, I was a Wesley fangirl, but getting older, it's all about

1254
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:14,560
Q. All about Q. I love Q. I love every bit of Q. So I actually have to say Q for Voyager

1255
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:20,560
as well since we've had Q and I think that the seven and the doctor are funny together.

1256
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,560
Yeah.

1257
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,800
The doctor was probably my favorite in Voyager.

1258
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:29,800
For DS9, I'd actually have to say, um, Judzia or, um, Worf.

1259
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,740
I really liked Odo though.

1260
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,920
My favorite was Guinan.

1261
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,560
Guinan will always be my favorite.

1262
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,560
I know.

1263
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,560
I love Whoopi.

1264
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
What can I say?

1265
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
All right.

1266
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,960
We're, we're being way too, this is a video game show, but I will say this, the fact that

1267
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,800
Star Trek is being made into this MMO, please don't suck.

1268
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:47,800
Please don't suck.

1269
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:54,080
I'm still making the race the O.L.O.R.I.E.N.D. Please, if there's God out there, do not let

1270
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:59,100
this game suck because right now, Star Trek is riding such a high, high wave and there

1271
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:04,360
is so much potential, but at the same time, there is so much they could fuck up beyond

1272
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,360
all belief.

1273
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,920
And I am praying that this game doesn't suck because I will be leaving all my other MMOs

1274
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,920
to play it.

1275
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,720
I have to quote Game Guru on this cause honestly, I fully agree with this.

1276
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,360
Carl Urbans McCoy makes me wonder if reincarnation exists.

1277
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,360
Yes.

1278
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,680
All right.

1279
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,560
Uh, that's it for the mailbag.

1280
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,800
If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1281
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,120
Hey guys, your calls soon.

1282
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,880
Uh, but first we have a little bit of gaming news for you guys and of course the classic

1283
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,880
game of the week.

1284
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,960
We haven't forgot that yet, but, uh, one more news story for you guys has to do with Forza

1285
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,560
Motorsport 3.

1286
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,520
I think y'all know it's coming.

1287
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,480
Y'all know it had to happen and sure enough, the German retail version of amazon.com called

1288
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:56,440
amazon.de has listed Forza Motorsport 3, Prima's official game guide out on September 30th.

1289
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,760
Whoops.

1290
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,720
Looks like that spilled the beans that Forza Motorsport 3 is coming.

1291
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,920
Uh, so that means that game is probably coming out around October.

1292
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,640
The guides usually come out a little bit before the games to help raise hype.

1293
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,560
Uh, it sounds like the game should come out in Europe in October, which probably is going

1294
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,480
to be a worldwide, worldwide release kind of thing.

1295
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:21,000
Um, granted it could always be a bug, take it with a grain of salt, but, uh, yep.

1296
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
There you go.

1297
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,720
Forza Motorsport 3 is coming at some point.

1298
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,800
Um, comments and chat.

1299
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,400
Why didn't you read my email?

1300
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,800
Because you sent it too late.

1301
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Yep.

1302
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,800
We'll read it next week.

1303
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
All right.

1304
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
Maybe.

1305
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:34,800
Maybe.

1306
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,800
We'll, uh, go to the email or go to, not the emails, we already went to the emails.

1307
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
We'll go to the Classic Game of the Week now.

1308
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,200
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer likes to dig through the archives and

1309
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,040
find a game she thinks y'all ought to be playing.

1310
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,040
So here it is.

1311
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,040
Classic Game of the Week.

1312
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,800
Classic Game of the Week is beer pong.

1313
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
Awesome.

1314
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
I'm kidding.

1315
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
It's actually DuckTales.

1316
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Woo.

1317
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
Woo.

1318
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Yeah.

1319
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Yay.

1320
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,480
It's about damn time I picked this one.

1321
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,480
I didn't actually put in a gameplay one up because I wanted the music, best music in

1322
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,480
the game.

1323
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:28,320
So anyway, it is, of course, based off of the Disney TV show, and it came out of Nintendo

1324
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,320
in 1989.

1325
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:35,080
And so you basically go around as Scrooge McDuck, who is going around to collect treasures

1326
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,720
all over the world and the moon.

1327
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,920
It came out on Game Boy, and it has nothing to do with DuckTales and Quest for Gold.

1328
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:51,680
So basically, this is really one of the top Capcom games for the Nintendo.

1329
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:59,480
It actually had Tokoru Fujiwara and Yuki-chan's Pop-Up.

1330
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,440
You gotta read the credits on some of the old Capcom games.

1331
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,440
I love it.

1332
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:09,440
It was really tight to play if you used a Scrooge's cane as a weapon and a poco stick

1333
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
and was non-linear.

1334
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:17,520
So basically, you're going around and you're helping NPCs and whacking enemies with a cane

1335
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,240
and telling them to get off your lawn or whatever.

1336
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,720
And you can actually play any of the levels in order.

1337
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,080
Like I said, non-linear.

1338
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:32,320
You have a boss you have to fight at the end of each level, two hidden treasures, there's

1339
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,880
a golden ring in the African mines and a golden mirror in the moon level.

1340
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:41,640
And after you've done all that, you go to Transylvania for some reason to do boss fights.

1341
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,760
So you can keep going back and unlock different parts of the levels and do different stuff.

1342
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:52,320
So you've got basically your DuckTales characters, you have Scrooge, you have Kiwi, Dewi, and

1343
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:58,920
Lily, Webby, Gizmo, Duck, Launchpad, Maquack, Gyro Gearloose, Ms. Beakley, Bubba, Magica

1344
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:06,880
Dispel, who is in Transylvania, Flintheart, Glomgold, and the Beagle Boys.

1345
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:12,760
And then you also have an alternate ending in the NES version, where if you finish the

1346
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:23,000
game with ten million dollars and have both of the hidden treasures, then you will have

1347
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,160
the news article come up with Scrooge winning, but he has a crown on his head, and a paper

1348
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,280
stating that he has stunned the world with his discovery of two lost treasures.

1349
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,360
So that's pretty cool.

1350
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,240
So yeah, it was by Capcom.

1351
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:42,160
There was actually a beta version that was out too, and actually we were releasing the

1352
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,920
Consumer's Guide hot tip for Coolest Nintendo's game.

1353
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:48,480
They had different levels, there was the Jungle, Ghost House, Underground, Snow Mountain, and

1354
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,840
Moon Surface.

1355
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:53,320
Hamburgers were your power-ups instead of ice cream.

1356
01:08:53,320 --> 01:09:03,000
The coffins in the Ghost House had crosses on them instead of R.E.P., although if you

1357
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,720
look in the NES Atlas, there are pictures of the original.

1358
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:12,440
The Moon music had a slower tempo music, and I've actually heard it, it's actually pretty

1359
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,440
good.

1360
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,480
The Ghost House had a different music track, and Gizmo Duck went by Roboduck.

1361
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:27,060
In the French version, it was called La Bande a Pichot, so it's the same DuckTales thing.

1362
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:32,720
And there was, the Famicom version was called Wanpaku Daku Yume Boken, which is Naughty Duck's

1363
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:39,480
Dream Adventure, and it didn't have all the censorship.

1364
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:44,040
So there was a DuckTales 2 game, it was not as popular.

1365
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:56,200
So it really though is, and by the way Yuki-chan's papa is Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, so gay, and it's

1366
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:01,960
really one of the classic classic classics, and like I had to play the Moon level music

1367
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:08,320
first, that is the identifiable stage, you play the beginning of that, and anyone who

1368
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:14,760
knows their gaming history will be able to point that right out, so yeah.

1369
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,240
Alright, maybe that'll be a Capcom surprise announcement.

1370
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,400
They have a secondary surprise announcement, they're supposed to make it E3, right?

1371
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,600
How about DuckTales 3 on the Wii?

1372
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,680
That's the sound you would hear across the world, fanboys shitting their pants.

1373
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,680
That's right.

1374
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:38,200
You know, also though, just to say, you know, if we want to even look at any more of Yoshihiro

1375
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:47,760
Sakaguchi's games, we have 1943, well 1943 Kai, we have Final Fight, Legendary Wings,

1376
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,360
Forgotten Worlds, Mega Man, Mega Man 2, we have Street Fighter, Street Fighter 2, did

1377
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:58,720
sound design, Warriors of Fate, so pretty cool.

1378
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,600
Very cool.

1379
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,160
One Night Stands asks, hey Dark Soccer, exactly why was this such a great game?

1380
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,900
I loved it as a kid, but it plays like a lot of other platformers.

1381
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,760
It just really, it's all of the elements combined, really, when you look at everything together,

1382
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,760
it's all those pieces.

1383
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,400
Yeah, I mean, yeah, there were a lot of platformers on the NES, but I think you had so many things

1384
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,760
falling into place on this one.

1385
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,880
You had a pretty good game, which is very important, you had a great license.

1386
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,440
You could go back and do your favorite levels as much as you wanted to.

1387
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:27,440
Right?

1388
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:34,040
You know, it was kind of like that Mega Man mixed with, I don't know, Mario-style platformer,

1389
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,040
and great music.

1390
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,200
I mean, just everything kind of fell into place with this game.

1391
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:45,000
I think one other reason, think about all the crap movie and cartoon and TV show tie-in

1392
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
games you have.

1393
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
God, I know, right?

1394
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
DuckTales breaks that mold, and I think for one, that might be one reason why people love

1395
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,560
it so much, is that DuckTales was actually a pretty enjoyable game at the time it came

1396
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,560
out.

1397
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,560
I really think so.

1398
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,560
That would be my best answer.

1399
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,560
I really agree with that.

1400
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,080
That, Rob, dear friend, is a proper assessment.

1401
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,560
All right, thank you.

1402
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:06,160
See, sometimes I say some good things on this program.

1403
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,940
It doesn't happen very often, but there you go.

1404
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:12,640
Tiger Claw says, I think what sets DuckTales apart from other platformers is the game mechanic

1405
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,620
involving Scrooge's cane.

1406
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:15,620
That's true, too.

1407
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,480
You know, what other game really had that new mechanic of using the cane to kind of

1408
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,000
knock things around and brought things into puzzles in a different way?

1409
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,400
But yeah, I mean, it's certainly a fair question to ask.

1410
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:32,400
If you have more questions you want to ask us, our Skype line is open right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1411
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,320
or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, you can call right now and give us a call.

1412
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,520
In the meantime, I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories.

1413
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,520
I don't have anything.

1414
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,920
I don't think Dark Soccer would have anything.

1415
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,120
Actually, you never know.

1416
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,120
Oh, gosh.

1417
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,960
All right, let's go to the phones.

1418
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,960
We got a call.

1419
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,960
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

1420
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,960
Shut that thing up.

1421
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,960
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

1422
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,960
Who's this?

1423
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,960
Hi, this is Stephanie.

1424
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,960
Hi, this is Spazinator.

1425
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,960
Hi, Spazinator.

1426
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,960
What's on your mind tonight?

1427
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,960
Not much.

1428
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:13,240
I was going to join the IRC chat, but unfortunately it won't work on my PlayStation 3.

1429
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:18,880
If you heard the Taylor and Bobby show, I was asking about possibly buying an arcade

1430
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,880
machine.

1431
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:36,520
What I'm specifically looking for is a classic game anywhere from the 80s up until the mid-90s.

1432
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,260
Let me ask you, are you looking to buy a specific game?

1433
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,840
You want an actual authentic, this might have sat in a pizzeria back in the 80s type of

1434
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,840
game.

1435
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,600
Or you want something, you know, you want something that will play all these games.

1436
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,720
You want like a main cabinet or you, I guess my question is, are you looking to collect

1437
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,880
or are you just looking to play?

1438
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:06,720
Um, I collect, uh, like the alphemics and singing, maybe the mayor's team and a pizzeria.

1439
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,400
I would go eBay, honestly.

1440
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,400
eBay or flea markets.

1441
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,960
Or even like Craigslist.

1442
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:17,280
DeNio's here in the Brisbane Sacramento area, they sell old arcade cabinets.

1443
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:22,640
You can even check, um, some of the entertainment companies that rent out the games and ask

1444
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,280
if they're putting anything for sale, eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, we've come to them that

1445
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,280
way.

1446
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:31,160
And I know this might sound, I know this might sound really cruel, but in this economy you

1447
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:36,040
have a lot of places going under, um, especially like arcades and some pizzerias.

1448
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,640
These places might be unloading their stuff.

1449
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,600
So look for, you know, listings on Craigslist and so on, but you'd be surprised.

1450
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,360
eBay is a great place to start.

1451
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,640
Um, but here's one thing you want to keep in mind, Spaznator, shipping is going to be

1452
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,060
a arm and a leg for a lot of these games.

1453
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,960
You might see some really cheap listings, like, you know, a $200 arcade machine.

1454
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,480
But at that, and if I remember right, you're in upstate New York.

1455
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,480
So if you buy a game from the West coast, you know, you're going to have to pay an arm

1456
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,080
and a leg in shipping fees.

1457
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,920
So you probably want to stick to things.

1458
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,400
I mean, you could certainly find your widest selection there on eBay, but you would definitely

1459
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,680
want to stick to things like Craigslist and things that are going to be a little more

1460
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,320
local in your areas that you don't have to pay that obscene shipping fee.

1461
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,920
You have the perk of having New York city, not too, too far away.

1462
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,960
If you're especially willing to drive and pick something up with a pickup truck, you

1463
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,280
can probably get some good deals.

1464
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,280
Yeah.

1465
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,760
The thing is I never drove a day in my life.

1466
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:32,040
I never bothered to get my license.

1467
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:39,920
And I don't think, well, I don't have any relatives that really live in the area that

1468
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:46,680
have a driver's license and have enough, you know, free time on their hands that would

1469
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:55,520
be willing to, you know, essentially take me out to wherever, you know, to pick up arcade

1470
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,160
gatherings and drive me back to my place.

1471
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,160
Well that's fair.

1472
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,480
I mean, if you don't have a license yourself, it's going to be kind of harder to get around

1473
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,480
and stuff.

1474
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,560
So you may have to just, you know, you may have to fork over those shipping fees, but

1475
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,600
just be prepared.

1476
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,620
There's going to be shipping fees and sometimes they're as much as the games are themselves

1477
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:14,720
because you're talking about, you know, sending a gigantic cabinet, which basically has to

1478
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,080
go on the back of a truck.

1479
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,400
You know, you are going to be spending a couple hundred dollars on shipping.

1480
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,560
So that's something you got to prepare yourself for when shopping, but if you can afford it,

1481
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,280
if that's within your budget, go for it.

1482
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,280
Yeah.

1483
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:33,680
Well, you know, if I do decide to go forward with this and get one, it'll probably be probably

1484
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:39,240
a few months before I get it, but, you know, I kind of figured, you know, it just would

1485
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:44,840
probably go hand in hand with, you know, my councils, you know, it would be a nice conversation

1486
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:51,120
for you to talk about and not only that, but, you know, I kind of miss, you know, the whole

1487
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,320
arcade experience that I used to have when I was, you know, a little kid, you know, going

1488
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,560
to the pizzerias and playing games.

1489
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:01,560
And let me ask you a question actually, Spaznator, since you're about to drop hundreds of dollars

1490
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:06,200
possibly on buying one of these machines for the nostalgia, you know, if you're going for

1491
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,320
the collector's route, you're going to get one game.

1492
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,060
It's not going to be a main cabin or something like that, that you can fix, switch between

1493
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,060
the different games.

1494
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,560
You're going to get one game.

1495
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,600
And I know there's people that would spend a lot of money to have one game.

1496
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,000
Like I myself, I don't know that, well, I don't know, I'd have to think about it, but

1497
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,120
there's certainly some games I would, I would buy.

1498
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:28,520
And you know, I see in chat right now, for instance, Brad and from Pod Culture says,

1499
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,560
I would kill for a classic Star Wars arcade machine.

1500
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,840
What machine do you think you're going to drop the money on?

1501
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:44,560
Um, well, I have like, uh, uh, top five first left, uh, you, uh, it would be like, uh, wall

1502
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,760
of combat two, uh, super street fighter two turbo.

1503
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:55,920
Um, and then of course, uh, killer, uh, killer instance two.

1504
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:02,360
And uh, you know, then, uh, like the, you know, Neo Geo MBS, the four swap one.

1505
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:05,620
Now that, you know what, look into that.

1506
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:08,840
That sounds like it might be a great option for you as those Neo Geo cabinets, because

1507
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,720
of the fact you can fit like four games in there and that way you get that classic collectible

1508
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:16,280
thing mixed in with, uh, Hey, I have more than just one game in here.

1509
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,520
That might be a good thing to look into, but the good news is with those fighting games,

1510
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,600
they made so many of them, especially street fighter twos.

1511
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,880
I'm sure you wouldn't have a hard time finding one at all.

1512
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,280
Finding a working one might be more of a challenge, but you never know people.

1513
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,760
I mean, there's people that fix that shit up as a hobby.

1514
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,280
So you might be, yeah.

1515
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,280
Yeah.

1516
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,280
Yeah.

1517
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,520
I kind of figured with the, at least with the fighting games, it's, uh, at least joysticks

1518
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,520
on them.

1519
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,800
Those two stars are going to be kind of beating out the joysticks themselves will probably

1520
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,800
beat these off.

1521
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,800
Yep.

1522
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,800
All right.

1523
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,360
Well, a spasinator, we're going to let you go, but good luck in your quest.

1524
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,360
Okay.

1525
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,360
All right.

1526
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,360
Thank you very much.

1527
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,360
No problem.

1528
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,360
Let us know when you get one.

1529
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,360
Okay.

1530
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,360
Goodbye.

1531
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,360
Wow.

1532
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,560
That was kind of a funny goodbye message there.

1533
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,680
Uh, this kind of caused some, uh, my question to spasinator kind of caused this, uh, snowball

1534
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:07,200
and chat talking about what games, uh, they would pay money for an S2 100.

1535
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,560
Matt wanted to throw out there.

1536
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,000
I would tell him to look for arcades that are closing down.

1537
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,440
Um, some other comments in chat, I want to say real quick, uh, one night stands said

1538
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,560
he would pay the money for X-Men arcade.

1539
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,560
Renee says, prop cycle, the poor man's DDR.

1540
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,840
Vid power says Simpsons arcade.

1541
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,880
Um, and let's see what else is there.

1542
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Uh, captain.

1543
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,880
Yes.

1544
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,200
Said I would kill for a super scope cabinet.

1545
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,680
So there you go.

1546
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,640
Um, and we just had Skype crash.

1547
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,640
That was weird.

1548
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,640
At least didn't crash my whole computer.

1549
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,640
Thank God.

1550
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,400
Skype just crashed sadly, and I was in the middle of a call when it did.

1551
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,520
So, so I apologize to the caller.

1552
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,760
Hopefully they will be able to get through again, but I am firing Skype back up so we

1553
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,520
can take more calls and we look like we're back up.

1554
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,880
Sorry about that.

1555
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,520
That's kind of crappy.

1556
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,280
One eight seven seven game.

1557
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,160
Oler username on Skype, live radio guys.

1558
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:56,600
Sometimes Skype will crash on us as we're doing the show live.

1559
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,600
Yeah.

1560
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,600
I like what Bobby and Chad is saying, uh, talking about getting a 2d X cabinet.

1561
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,760
You know, I think if I were to drop the money, I'd have to get something Bemani related.

1562
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,800
Yeah, I think I'd get a 2d X and probably honestly I think I'd want a happy sky.

1563
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,800
We'll see.

1564
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,800
Hey, we got another call.

1565
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:11,800
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

1566
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,800
Who's this?

1567
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,800
Wow.

1568
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,800
I can't believe I got through for this.

1569
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,800
This is my first time calling.

1570
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,800
This is excellent.

1571
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,800
Well, hi, excellent.

1572
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,800
Congratulations on making it through.

1573
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,600
You might've lucked out cause some other, unfortunately we were on the line with another

1574
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,880
call and then Skype crashed and I really feel bad, but that's just live radio sometimes

1575
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,520
and Hey, you got through and you've never been on before.

1576
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,000
So what's on your mind?

1577
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Well, first off, I, I don't know about exactly about the pinball games exactly, uh, uh, arcade.

1578
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I'm sorry.

1579
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Arcade games.

1580
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,440
I know about more, a little more about pinballs than I do arcade because I used to work on

1581
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,840
them working at arcade.

1582
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:48,920
But um, yeah, the, um, the, the ones like street fighters and the use of those ones

1583
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,320
are a little more commonplace to find than you would with some of the other ones.

1584
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:55,040
Um, the more newer they are, the easier to find.

1585
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,060
Of course, the more harder they're fine is the more older they are.

1586
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:03,360
So you really would have to search and I know he's overseas, so that'd probably be even

1587
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,000
more hard than it is over here in the U S where it's just a tad bit more commonplace

1588
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,960
maybe than say like over there in Sweden.

1589
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:17,080
Uh, it really depends on all of those factors, but I do agree the best way to find an arcade

1590
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,040
game without having to pay all the shipping, look for an, look for an arcade near you that's

1591
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,040
closing down.

1592
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,040
Yeah.

1593
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,040
No joke.

1594
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,040
I'm bad.

1595
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:28,080
Like I said, before we closed down, unfortunately my arcade, we had like four and a half pages

1596
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,080
full of arcade, different arcade games.

1597
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,520
So I mean, yeah, if you find one that's nearly getting ready to close down, you probably

1598
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,080
can pick one up for a good price.

1599
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,080
Well there you go.

1600
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:40,760
Hopefully the advice will be taken, even though I think that last caller wasn't overseas,

1601
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,380
they're upstate New York, but I know we do have other listeners that are overseas that

1602
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:47,400
can take that, um, uh, advice to heart.

1603
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,720
Well what else is on your mind?

1604
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,720
Glee.

1605
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,720
Great show.

1606
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,720
First off.

1607
01:21:52,720 --> 01:22:00,760
Yes, I was calling more in tone to THQ and their golden Wii that they sent over to overseas

1608
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:01,760
there.

1609
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,760
Yes.

1610
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:06,600
Glee was amazing, by the way, if folks need a new TV show to watch, even though there's

1611
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:11,280
only the one episode, definitely reminded me of being a music geek in high school.

1612
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,020
But ah, yes, we actually were gonna, before we made it a short show tonight when Loki

1613
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,860
wasn't able to be here, we were gonna talk about the golden Wii.

1614
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,960
Tell us a little bit about this and what you wanted to say about it.

1615
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:28,440
THQ, which unfortunately lost a major amount of money over the last year, which I thought

1616
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:34,800
that was even more ironic, decided to send a golden Wii overseas to the UK to give to

1617
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,380
the queen as a thank you.

1618
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:39,380
For what?

1619
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,380
A thank you for what?

1620
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,380
Just being queenly?

1621
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:45,960
Well, as a, as a, as a way to promoting their new game.

1622
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,960
Gotcha.

1623
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,840
I was gonna say though, come on, I don't think the queen is really gonna play this

1624
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,840
Wii.

1625
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:57,040
She's obviously a little old and I think every time I've seen her in, in, you know, on TV

1626
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,280
and stuff, she seems to be, have limited mobility.

1627
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,680
I'm sure someone would argue with me whether that means she can't play the Wii or not,

1628
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,840
but you know, come on, she's a queen, she's the freaking queen of England.

1629
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,920
I think she's got better things to do than sit there and play the Wii.

1630
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,960
However, I think it's one of those things that you'll see in a museum someday as the

1631
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,640
Wii the queen once owned, even though she never touched it.

1632
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:22,920
Supposedly she, she has a, uh, supposedly she was playing the Wii before with the prince.

1633
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,480
Supposedly there was articles about that, so that's why they sent her over one, so she

1634
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,480
could have one of her own.

1635
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:32,800
I stand corrected, what a great photo op that must have been.

1636
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,680
I just like to see her play Mike Tyson's punch out, I think that'd be even funnier.

1637
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:41,100
I don't know about that, I, she probably was playing something, probably Wii bowling, cause

1638
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,040
I know that's something that, uh, this is gonna sound terrible, especially considering

1639
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,600
I'm talking about the queen of England, but look, this is life, part of life is getting

1640
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,600
old.

1641
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,920
Uh, the Wii bowling is really popular in, like, senior citizen centers, and like, all

1642
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,480
these things, like, they'll actually have Wii bowling night at the senior citizen center

1643
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:02,000
and all these really fun things, so I betcha that's what she was playing, if anything.

1644
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,800
And if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong again.

1645
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:04,800
What else is new?

1646
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,680
Nah, that's pretty much about it I can think of.

1647
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,260
I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of E3 in a couple weeks out of all these rumors

1648
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:14,080
and stuff, and see which ones are true and which ones are false.

1649
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,080
Me too.

1650
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:19,160
So, out of curiosity, what do you, since, you know, OLR can't compete with the commercial

1651
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:24,080
sites, what do you want us to bring you from E3?

1652
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,600
Whatever news is not given, I guess, because a lot of it's gonna be hard, because a lot

1653
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,000
of the news, as soon as it's gonna break, is gonna be put all, posted all over the web

1654
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,920
and Twitter and Facebook and all that, so.

1655
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,000
It's gonna be harder this year, cause there's no Kensha Hall for everyone to ignore, or

1656
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,920
do the nice fluff piece that is, uh, you know, the one article on the entirety of Kensha

1657
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:44,920
Hall.

1658
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,440
And from what I understand, we're not having that this year, so, uh, it's gonna be difficult

1659
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:53,700
to really dig around, but we will try to find the Kensha in E3 for you guys.

1660
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:59,720
What I would like to see is maybe even, you know, like, what the independent people are

1661
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,720
doing.

1662
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:03,920
What are some of these games that are blowkey that should have been up to par, you know,

1663
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,160
that should have been, you know, the major hits that are maybe not as hits.

1664
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:11,640
I will do my best to dig up the independent stuff for you guys, and I think that's where

1665
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,400
we're gonna have to find our niche this year, is that I bet there's a lot of people that

1666
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:19,760
want to be heard, and they're gonna be excited, uh, to have somebody care, and, uh, certainly,

1667
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,640
you know what, let's find the next Braid.

1668
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,800
Let's find the next Katamari Damacy.

1669
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,720
Let's find that next big thing that hasn't been discovered yet.

1670
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,720
I like that idea.

1671
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:33,280
All right, well, XLink, we gotta let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank

1672
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:37,320
you so much, first time caller, and, uh, we'll, uh, call us again sometime.

1673
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,320
Oh, definitely.

1674
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,320
All right, later, dude.

1675
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,320
Thanks.

1676
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,320
Uh, we'll take some more calls.

1677
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:47,400
Uh, by the way, some other comments from Chat Rehman, what they want to see from E3, rlbx327

1678
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:52,400
wants to know about the iPhone games at E3, uh, actdef says, King of Fighter XII details.

1679
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,680
You know, I did get an email about a pre-tournament that's going on, but it's going on, like,

1680
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,320
I think the Sunday before E3, so, sadly, we'll still be here, we can't go, but I know there's

1681
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:05,360
gonna be some tournaments going on, uh, AlphaKananagram wants some Katamari Forever footage in a soundtrack

1682
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,360
bootleg.

1683
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:10,400
I don't know how Namco would feel about a bootleg on our site, but we'll try.

1684
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,120
Ha, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1685
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:18,080
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1686
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:25,880
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio, okay, the caller isn't there, apparently, uh, 1877

1687
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,520
Game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio, remember, you can always test the calls

1688
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,480
before giving us a call at Echo123 is the username on Skype, and that's a great way

1689
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,480
to make sure that your microphone is working and all that fun stuff before you actually

1690
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:38,480
call us.

1691
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,680
Of course, that doesn't work with a touch tone phone, um, touch tone phones are much

1692
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:44,600
easier though, you just pick up the phone and call, I don't think I've ever seen a phone

1693
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:48,560
not work, although I have seen them be quiet, I've just never seen them, like, not actually

1694
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,560
work at all.

1695
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,560
Let's try this again.

1696
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,560
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1697
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:54,040
Sorry about that, my mic's screwed up, it's Gold Anthro.

1698
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,200
That's alright, I'm glad you got through, because I know you were the caller that we

1699
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,160
crashed on earlier, well, what's on your mind?

1700
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,000
Ah, don't worry about it.

1701
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,600
Um, well, I guess I could say I had a, uh, quite a weekend, uh, uh, along with, uh, one

1702
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:13,480
of the OLR staff members, DJ Ron Mass, I went to Anime Boston 2009 this weekend, on Saturday.

1703
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,800
Ah, and how was that?

1704
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,680
I'm happy to hear that, uh, there was some OLR meetups going on, because I know somewhere

1705
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:23,340
in the Bay Area right now, GS68 is crying because he's the only OLR guy at Fanime, which

1706
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:28,000
I'm very sad I didn't get to this year, but, next year, next year, well, how was Anime

1707
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Boston?

1708
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,700
Uh, it was good, um, I guess, uh, it was my first convention, I really didn't know what

1709
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:40,360
to expect, but, um, uh, it was pretty good, it was pretty good, um, one of the first things

1710
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:46,160
I did was find, uh, DJ Ron Mass, um, he, uh, was selling some stuff, he didn't seem to

1711
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:51,160
have any good luck this, uh, weekend, but he said overall he had a good time, I guess,

1712
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,480
I guess he'll be calling in maybe next week to talk about it, I think he's getting home

1713
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:56,480
late.

1714
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,480
Oh, I'm sure he will.

1715
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,480
Today's his birthday too, if I'm not mistaken, so happy birthday to you guys, if you're with

1716
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,480
me.

1717
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,000
Yes, yes it is, everybody wish him a happy birthday, I know I did.

1718
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
So he's probably out enjoying that and not listening to the show tonight, which I completely

1719
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
understand.

1720
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,080
Um, here's something I'm gonna ask you, one thing that always impressed me about Anime

1721
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,120
conventions, you know, I'm not super into Anime, I don't know how much you're into it

1722
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,560
or what have you, but one thing that always kind of impressed me about the conventions,

1723
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:21,680
despite my lack of knowledge, is the art dealer rooms, and some of the fan inspired art that

1724
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:25,800
you see in these rooms, um, you know, and this crosses over into video games too, because

1725
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,060
I'll tell you, you can't walk through one of these, uh, hallways without seeing some

1726
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:31,960
Kingdom Hearts inspired, you know, fan art or something.

1727
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:35,400
Did you see any art, I don't know if you looked around the art dealer room, did you see some

1728
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,720
art that really jumped out of you that you thought was awesome, and what was it?

1729
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:44,240
I saw a lot of stuff, I saw anything from like, like Anime stuff from like Death Note,

1730
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:49,560
if I've seen the typical, stereotypical, stupid Naruto stuff, that's just my opinion, not

1731
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,600
fact, but I just, that's not my thing.

1732
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:57,960
Uh, I also found video game stuff, uh, like basically, uh, what did you say you were wondering

1733
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:58,960
if there was there?

1734
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,560
Oh, I don't know, I know there's always something Kingdom Hearts, but did anything kind of jump

1735
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,560
out of you?

1736
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,560
Kingdom Hearts, yes.

1737
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,560
Okay, let me give you an example.

1738
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:10,680
Let me give you an example, when I was at, um, ASEN, I actually bought this, I thought

1739
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,600
it was so rad, because I bought it for, um, my boyfriend, who, um, I know is a big fan

1740
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,560
of this, but, um, they actually had an art dealer table, and she had a drawing of David

1741
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,160
Bowie from Labyrinth, and I just thought that was so awesome, I'm like, how random to find

1742
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:28,760
something like that in an Anime con, but did you see anything that like, like, jumped out

1743
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:29,760
of you like that?

1744
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,160
Like, wow, I didn't expect to see that at an art dealer table.

1745
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:40,960
Um, I, I, I guess, a lot, pretty much everything was unexpected for me, like I said, this was

1746
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:46,560
my first con, I, I saw, I mean, there was someone with little, uh, I also have a friend

1747
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:51,800
in chat called our Robocon that doesn't seem to get to listen to OLR a lot, but he tries

1748
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:57,720
to catch the podcast, he's live in there now, um, but, uh, we, we went together on Saturday,

1749
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:02,160
and I got, I got some, uh, they had like little buttons they were selling for like 50 cents

1750
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:06,160
to a hundred, I mean, one dollar, uh, I got like a little thing from The World Ends With

1751
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:11,240
You, that little pin that you'd get in the RPG game, that portable RPG game that says

1752
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:15,280
you're, you're in, you're in the, uh, game thing, I don't know if you...

1753
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,960
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I, okay, that's cool, and yeah, The World Ends With You definitely

1754
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:24,440
is, uh, has its fans, especially the Squeenix fans, so okay, cool, cool.

1755
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:30,120
Yeah, I also saw, I saw something interesting, it was a stained glass thing, um, of various

1756
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:36,000
Death Note anime characters, um, it had the character, the Detective L, but it was like

1757
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,080
a vampire version of him with like blue hair, and it was pretty cool, it was like stained

1758
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,080
glass.

1759
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,080
That sounds kind of neat, stained glass is always pretty cool, well look, I want to ask

1760
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,320
you about this before we let you go, but how about the game room?

1761
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,320
Sure.

1762
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,480
I mean, we're video games and gaming, how was the game room in anime Boston?

1763
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:57,160
I was, I was going to bring that up, yeah, the game room was, um, it, it was, uh, I think

1764
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:02,520
they used like the, uh, Grand Ballroom and the, see this is in Boston, Massachusetts,

1765
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:07,960
the Heinz Convention Center, they were, I think they used the ballroom for the, uh,

1766
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:13,360
video game thing, uh, when they, what?

1767
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,360
Go ahead, Will.

1768
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,080
What kind of games did you see in the room when you went there?

1769
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:23,960
Um, I saw, they had a Street Fighter IV tournament going on, they had, uh, I, I finally got to

1770
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,240
play popin' music, it was pretty, that was a pretty cool experience.

1771
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,240
I love popin' music.

1772
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:35,000
Yeah, I know, uh, that's why I had, that's why I brought that up, and, um, the interesting

1773
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,920
thing is, they had, they had, they had the Rock Band 2 set up with the, uh, on the Xbox

1774
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:45,840
360, the interesting thing I saw was that Nintendo Wii that they had actually was using,

1775
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,440
running on the homebrew channel, uh, the, uh, homebrew channel, which allows you to

1776
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:55,480
run, like, um, self-made applications, among other things, and they were using it for perfectly,

1777
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:58,280
uh, legitimate reasons, so I thought, I thought it was kinda cool.

1778
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,280
Of course.

1779
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,280
Of course.

1780
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:01,560
Okay, I got one more question for you before we let you go, and it actually comes from

1781
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,400
our chat room, from our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf, heard before us here Sunday nights on

1782
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,400
All Games Radio.

1783
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:11,960
Uh, Bobby asked, Anime Boston is in the same place as PAX Boston is going to be.

1784
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:16,480
How was the size of the place, because some people are speculating it may not be big enough

1785
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,920
for an event the size of PAX.

1786
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:26,520
Um, I think, I think that it's, uh, well, I think there's, there's like three floors,

1787
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:32,560
um, three, I think it's like a three-floor place, and, uh, we were all around it, and,

1788
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,280
uh, uh, it's pretty big, it really is, it's, it's bigger than, uh, I thought it was gonna

1789
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,280
be.

1790
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:42,080
Like, there's a, there's a mall that's, like, attached to it, like, uh, and we got some

1791
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,440
food there afterwards, but, but it's, it's pretty big, I mean, even without that, the

1792
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:51,200
convention center itself, I mean, it, it, so yeah, I think it could handle PAX, PAX

1793
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,400
East, because, I mean, the attendance just keeps climbing every year on Anime Boston

1794
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:58,760
as it is, so yeah, it could probably handle that.

1795
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,380
That's interesting news, because I was, uh, I saw that the, uh, I was expecting it to

1796
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:08,400
be Memorial Day weekend the next week, and it wasn't, so I, I saw that it was, like,

1797
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:13,480
April 2nd or 4th from, uh, Anime Boston, so probably somebody else, like, took, took the

1798
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:14,480
Memorial Day weekend.

1799
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:17,600
Yeah, it happens, it happens, there's a lot of big conventions, Memorial Day weekend.

1800
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,360
Alright, well, um, we gotta let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for the report, and, uh,

1801
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,040
glad to hear you enjoyed your first con.

1802
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,280
Yeah, thanks a lot, Rob.

1803
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,280
No problem.

1804
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,200
Maybe I'll see you at PAX Boston, speaking of which, since it sounds like this is your

1805
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,200
neck of the woods.

1806
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:34,680
I'll see what I can do, uh, I have to, I, I'll have to work things out, but we'll, we'll

1807
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,680
meet someday.

1808
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,680
Alright, someday.

1809
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,680
I'll see you later.

1810
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,680
Alright, take care, buddy.

1811
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,680
Someday, Gadget.

1812
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,680
Bye.

1813
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,440
I'll get you next time, Gadget.

1814
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,440
Next time.

1815
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,440
Um, why not?

1816
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,920
We'll do one more call if it comes in pretty soon here on the phones.

1817
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,040
How you doing over there, Doc Soccer?

1818
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,040
You've...

1819
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,840
I'm doing fine, I'm actually checking for video game sims.

1820
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,840
Oh, yeah?

1821
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,600
I found one of, uh, Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 4, so that's a pretty good one.

1822
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,600
That's fun.

1823
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,160
You know, I still have yet to play Resident Evil 5, what the hell's wrong with me?

1824
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:02,800
But, outside, outside of the demo.

1825
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,200
Alright, well, our phones, sadly, are not really ringing right now, so we're gonna go

1826
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,200
ahead and close up the lines.

1827
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,200
Dammit, call!

1828
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,200
Nah, it's too late, I closed up the lines.

1829
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,160
We're at about an hour and a half now, anyway, and I wanna go run out and get some food and,

1830
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,680
and enjoy the rest of my Memorial Day weekend, as I'm sure a lot of you folks do.

1831
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,680
So we're gonna go ahead and go around and start to wrap things up, and get on out of

1832
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,680
here for the evening.

1833
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,680
So, um...

1834
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,680
In ribbons and bows?

1835
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,680
If we want to.

1836
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,040
Uh, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

1837
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:29,500
I guess we'll start with me tonight, although I don't have much of a final thought tonight.

1838
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,160
My final thought is...

1839
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,160
Yogurt.

1840
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,160
I want yogurt.

1841
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,160
I want some too!

1842
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,800
That would be amazing right now, would be some yogurt.

1843
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,480
That would be fant- fantastical.

1844
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,480
Not fro-gurt.

1845
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:40,480
But yogurt.

1846
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,320
Cause the fro-gurt has potassium benzoate.

1847
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:45,320
Never mind.

1848
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,320
Uh...

1849
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,920
Dark Sakura, what's your final thought tonight?

1850
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,920
Um...

1851
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:49,920
Porn.

1852
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,480
There you go, it ended how it began.

1853
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,760
Hey, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting Independent Podcasting.

1854
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,440
Loki should be back next week, as will I, as will Dark Sakura, for our big pre-E3 show.

1855
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,920
I know you've probably heard E3 talked about to death on other shows, but we are gonna

1856
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:09,000
be taking your last request for what you want to see us cover at E3, and all of that we'll

1857
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,240
be doing next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1858
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:16,800
If- again, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about the program, help

1859
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,480
spread the good word about the show, help offset those a-holes that leave negative reviews

1860
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,100
on websites because they have nothing better to do with their sorry-ass lives, uh, because

1861
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:28,920
it really helps, you know, us have the motivation to keep going when you guys, uh, say good

1862
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,800
things about us and- and just knowing we have certain people that would be here every week.

1863
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,800
You know-

1864
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,480
I also like when you send me money.

1865
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:39,440
Although sometimes it can be frustrating when people bitch and moan and bellyache when you

1866
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,900
go a week without a show, or that the podcast was late or whatever, it does show that people

1867
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:49,800
care enough to complain, so I actually kind of see the good in that, and thanks everybody

1868
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,080
for your passion around the show, it- it- that is very motivating, surprisingly enough.

1869
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,480
So keep us on our toes, I guess is what I'm saying.

1870
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,480
Twinkle toes!

1871
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,480
There you go.

1872
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,480
Alright, that's it.

1873
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:00,480
We're out of here.

1874
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,840
Have a great night everybody, and uh, tune in next week, we'll be back with more of Orange

1875
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,840
Lounge Radio.

1876
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:05,840
