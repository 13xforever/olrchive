[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, May 24th, 2009, an OLR favor game is getting remade on the DS and Wii.

2
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Sony confirm the smaller PS3 with their lawsuits?

3
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Will I soon be able to rent games on my PSP?

4
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:36,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,770
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

9
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn.

10
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:53,351
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just wanted to say porn.

11
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the internet for porn?

12
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted the first word that I said on the show tonight to be porn.

13
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:57,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well there you go, it was.

14
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Second word of the show, official word of the show.

15
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:00,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

16
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:01,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Tribble.

17
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so are you into Tribble porn or something?

18
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:07,799
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I went to see Star Trek again for the third time in the theater.

19
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went back to Becky's house and watched Tribble with Tribbles and then Trial and Tribblations.

20
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:14,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see the new HD?

21
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:17,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Because apparently they remade a bunch of Star Trek episodes in HD.

22
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:24,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to tell you, everyone who goes to see the movie or goes to see it again, when they first show Scotty, look on his desk, there's a Tribble.

23
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:25,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

24
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:26,554
[SPEAKER_06]: OMG spoilers.

25
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:27,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

26
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, like the Tribble.

27
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and the way they defeat the guy is Tribbles.

28
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:37,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So since you brought up porn, what would you say is your favorite porn?

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,311
[SPEAKER_03]: The Boneheads.

30
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:43,572
The Boneheads.

31
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:46,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Ali McFeel Bible Black

32
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:08,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's kind of cool.

33
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:08,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.

34
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:20,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look in the chat, chat.orangelonestradio.com is always there when, you know, every night, every week that we tape this show, you guys are always there to entertain us with your chat comments.

35
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:24,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have Tiger Claw says, Sky, the classic Star Trek series in HD is now available in Blu-ray.

36
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I've heard about that.

37
00:02:27,577 --> 00:02:29,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus all the old movies are available in Blu-ray too.

38
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,860
[SPEAKER_06]: But wake me when they have the next generation movies in Blu-ray.

39
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Mesa Suma.

40
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Triple porn aren't triples born pregnant.

41
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:40,423
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if you pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.

42
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:41,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

43
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:46,506
[SPEAKER_06]: One Night Stands in chat says, I just saw a porno called Six Fags Magic Mount Him.

44
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:49,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see that.

45
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:49,667
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds funny.

46
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:50,647
[SPEAKER_06]: See, those are my favorite ones.

47
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,288
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that are based off of actual movies.

48
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:53,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, Final Fuck X was crap.

49
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Good cosplay, really crappy porn.

50
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:58,130
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about games sometimes on this show.

51
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,251
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're probably wondering, where's Loki?

52
00:03:00,271 --> 00:03:00,991
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't heard him yet.

53
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We gagged him with duct tape and tape.

54
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:04,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

55
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a drunk show though, it's a beer show

56
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:58,877
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is drinking beer.

57
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:01,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I, however, due to everything I went through last year, I'm not drinking.

58
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:02,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I have vodka.

59
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:03,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I have vodka.

60
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:03,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.

61
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just alcohol in general is a bad idea.

62
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some rubbing alcohol.

63
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I have wine once in a while.

64
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I have wine once in a while.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want wine.

66
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I have witch hazel.

67
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to be sober tonight.

68
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:15,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to set a good example for the kids since you're setting a bad one.

69
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:16,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I have peroxide.

70
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:17,282
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, look.

71
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:20,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up and tell us about your gaming week.

72
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Sims.

73
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:23,844
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

74
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:25,623
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

75
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:47,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been enjoying porn and sims.

76
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:53,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually found a bunch of naughty items that I just was curious to see how they worked so I downloaded them just to see.

77
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:55,088
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really horrible.

78
00:04:56,268 --> 00:04:59,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think people go instantly to doing dirty porno things?

79
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes back to the first things that you learn in any language is how to cuss and how to talk about sex.

80
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:09,385
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

81
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:36,673
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sims Body Shop thing, where you can, you know, if you download different skins and everything, you can make your own Sims look pretty cool.

82
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:47,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I showed Rob one that I made of a couple of characters I used to have, and I've even done one for, you know, quite a number of my old tabletop game characters are pretty cool.

83
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:49,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I did one of me.

84
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do one of Rob, just because it's funny.

85
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:52,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob Sim Rob Sim

86
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:13,875
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one I built, though, is pretty damn cool, and I love it, and I would actually live in that house if I could.

87
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:24,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've been, you know, sort of letting out an artistic thing, you know, something that's been lagging, you know, while I've been in school.

88
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my artsy stuff has been focused toward...

89
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,822
[SPEAKER_03]: My assignments towards this theme, that theme, getting this done, getting that done.

90
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:36,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've really just sort of enjoyed having kind of a point-and-click kind of artistry lately.

91
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:39,587
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where I don't have to really use my brain so much.

92
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:41,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just pick things as I want to.

93
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:42,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been pretty cool.

94
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:45,691
[SPEAKER_06]: You might need to play some Ragnarok this week, because I'm thinking about signing up.

95
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:46,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

96
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:48,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played Ragnarok in about a month now.

97
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute.

98
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,595
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the same girl who every week is like, oh, you should sign up on my server.

99
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:53,816
[SPEAKER_06]: You should sign up and play some Ragnarok.

100
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:56,137
[SPEAKER_03]: If you sign up and play with me, I'll play.

101
00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:57,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, because I might do that.

102
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Transitioning into my gaming week, I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft this week, of course, as usual, but...

103
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:06,897
[SPEAKER_06]: There's theatrics going on.

104
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:07,538
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll leave it at that.

105
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:08,258
[SPEAKER_06]: There's theatrics.

106
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,099
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just kind of making me go, whatever.

107
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I play games for fun.

108
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why everybody else can't do the same thing.

109
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:20,065
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, so I'm thinking about just chilling out in another game for a little while while I can.

110
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:24,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Because life's going to get very busy with, you know, in a couple weeks being E3 and everything going on.

111
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:29,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, now's a good time to sell me on other MMOs if you want to get me to check it out.

112
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:31,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Even part of me was like, I should go back and check out Final Fantasy XI.

113
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:32,513
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I was like...

114
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,094
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's really a bad idea.

115
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:36,155
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a bad idea, Rob.

116
00:07:50,355 --> 00:08:05,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Other games in my gaming week You know, I haven't actually played an awful lot I know, it's kind of like, it's affecting both Jamie and I But I did fire up the 360 earlier this week And was still playing some Space Invaders Extreme And I finally bought Outrun Because I checked out the demo like a while back But I finally actually had some time to sit down

117
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

118
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:30,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to play more of the multiplayer though.

119
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:39,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I only really checked out single player this week and was trying to beat it and would come so close and can't seem to beat it because I suck at video games.

120
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:40,727
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know.

121
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:42,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't spend enough time with it.

122
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:43,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

123
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,871
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah.

124
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:51,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I've been watching some movies and just catching up on some other stuff around the house and other things going on in my personal life.

125
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:54,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow's going to be a big video gaming day, though.

126
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a lot of other stuff planned, so my things to do are clean and play video games and to get in a bunch of things before E3.

127
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a Twitter...

128
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:32,385
[SPEAKER_06]: message asking me to check out Team Fortress 2 which I'm going to try to do tomorrow also I really need to get in and play more Left 4 Dead so I might make it a PC day tomorrow but I also want to go back and visit some of my Xbox 360 RPGs like I don't know why I have this real itch to go back and do Lost Odyssey because I only really got through like maybe the first third or the first half and I really want to go and finish that so we'll see so yeah that's my plans for this upcoming week

129
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:33,823
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you guys?

130
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:35,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys have a good gaming week?

131
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:35,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at chat room.

132
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:40,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheeseburger says, I saw Star Trek twice already and I'm going to see it again.

133
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:42,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I got you beat.

134
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:47,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfolded Raptor says, I've been playing Bionic Commando all day and I'm already 63% done.

135
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:48,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious how fun that is.

136
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:52,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been hearing some mixed things on it, so I'm kind of curious what our chatters think of that.

137
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly I like the old school one.

138
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like the redone old school one.

139
00:09:57,257 --> 00:09:59,858
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a real fun one on Xbox Live Arcade.

140
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:00,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

141
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:05,197
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru asks when is E3?

142
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:30,305
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 is not this upcoming week like tomorrow but it's a week after like it starts a week from Tuesday June 2nd is when it starts and I'll be going down there Monday night so we're still going to have shows actually through E3 week because DarkSakura is not going I do not believe we're going to be doing anything live from E3 but stay tuned to the Twitter and to the website you never know what surprise we might have cooked up I am going to take my video camera

143
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:40,275
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I was telling Bobby earlier, Bobby Blackwolf, who's before us here on Sunday nights on All Games Radio, I don't think there's a lot we can do that all the big websites aren't already going to do.

144
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to be the first to report on the news.

145
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We rarely are.

146
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to really be on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest E3 news.

147
00:10:49,644 --> 00:10:50,645
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we can do...

148
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:53,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you guys have been reading what's going on at E3.

149
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,930
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want us to dig and find?

150
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:57,452
[SPEAKER_06]: We're your reporters on the show.

151
00:10:57,772 --> 00:10:59,534
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the show where every gamer has a voice.

152
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:00,655
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want us to find?

153
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:06,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be definitely using Twitter and the website and some other things to find out what you guys want us to dig up at E3.

154
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:11,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So look for that and our reports, be it in video form or other tweets or what have you.

155
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:13,187
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be looking at that.

156
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:15,161
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

157
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:38,981
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure the person listens to this show because it seemed like the kind of thing where it's just to get a rise out of us.

158
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:41,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, dude, we do this stuff for free.

159
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:43,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like reading stuff like that is really disheartening.

160
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:46,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave five-star reviews for the shows you like.

161
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:50,788
[SPEAKER_06]: But what good is it to leave a one-star review for these other shows and people that work hard?

162
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're really crap.

163
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to think we're not really crap.

164
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:56,772
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Rob?

165
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't care.

166
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, but it sucks because that, and I blame Apple.

167
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:08,785
[SPEAKER_06]: It affects your ranking on the whole if you go in and look at the lineups of the shows in there.

168
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,148
[SPEAKER_06]: We were on page one and now we dropped to page three.

169
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:12,931
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of disappointing.

170
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,913
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing that bugs me about it.

171
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:15,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I don't care.

172
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:17,874
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll elaborate it.

173
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:18,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

174
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:19,536
[SPEAKER_06]: How about some gaming news, shall we?

175
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:19,656
[SPEAKER_06]: About.

176
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:34,893
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

177
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:37,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, kind of a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.

178
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:38,515
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D Realms.

179
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:43,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were talking about how 3D Realms went under, quote-unquote, and took Duke Nukem Forever with it.

180
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:53,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is interesting because apparently 3D Realms actually released a public statement this week after the whole development team was dissolved that was working on Duke Nukem Forever.

181
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:57,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said they are not closed and they are not closing.

182
00:12:57,683 --> 00:13:06,777
[SPEAKER_06]: However, they are saying that Take-Two will be retaining the publishing rights to Duke Nukem forever, and they will be able to sell the game directly to the public.

183
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:08,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

184
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:29,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

185
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:35,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like there's two sides to every story, and I still can't help but think, guys, what were you producing on this game?

186
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,103
[SPEAKER_06]: There was not a lot of public buzz going on because they refused to release screenshots.

187
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:41,544
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no demo.

188
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:43,585
[SPEAKER_06]: They hadn't shown at E3 for years.

189
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:45,487
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they expect was going to happen?

190
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:51,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as much as I was excited for Duke Nukem Forever, like the last guy, tease us a little bit with something.

191
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:57,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand, Take-Two probably had the open book, and they got to see everything that was going on, but still, I mean, it's a business.

192
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:27,692
[SPEAKER_06]: and if people aren't it's tough to sell a game in this day and age with you know look at Prey and how kind of disappointing that ended up being sales wise you know if there's not the buzz out there for the game it's not going to be pretty and I bet you anything now that Take-Two does have the rights to this we're going to see this game out in a year or two tops two years tops this game comes out well we can if it ever really does I mean honestly I sort of lost my expectation of it really coming out

193
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:28,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

194
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And I even think at this point it might be a subpar game, but I don't know.

195
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to write it off completely.

196
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Never write off a game until you play it.

197
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:37,086
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm planning to do.

198
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a game that some people might get to play if they have a Dreamcast.

199
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out for Windows, Linux, and Dreamcast.

200
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:43,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

201
00:14:44,435 --> 00:15:00,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a homebrew game called Hypertension, and it is a re-imaging of Blood, which uses the Doom-based Edge engine.

202
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:06,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's kind of old school in that sense, but it's coming out on Dreamcast, so...

203
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:08,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, why not?

204
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,351
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got it, buy it, I guess.

205
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:20,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking a little bit at the play from it, and I'm really not impressed.

206
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:22,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, then again, it's old school.

207
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Doom-like.

208
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:25,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that not?

209
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:26,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

210
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some 3D, I guess.

211
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,881
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not pixely.

212
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks a little like, yeah, Doomish.

213
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:33,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quakey.

214
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:38,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Doomish meets, yeah, kind of in that vein, the early 90s, or I guess maybe the mid-90s.

215
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:41,173
[SPEAKER_03]: But the weapon is aerosol and a lighter.

216
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:41,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

217
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:45,774
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, is there really a market for these types of Dreamcast games?

218
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:46,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of funny.

219
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:47,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

220
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Does everybody report on these games because it's like, OMG, new Dreamcast game.

221
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:52,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would have thought?

222
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:58,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's notable, you know, that there's being homebrewed, you know.

223
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:00,672
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

224
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,094
[SPEAKER_03]: People still love the Dreamcast, I guess.

225
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:03,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

226
00:16:05,676 --> 00:16:06,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

227
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:10,178
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing I did love about the Dreamcast is that there was so much homebrew available for it.

228
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:12,060
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I play most of all on my Dreamcast?

229
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,580
[SPEAKER_06]: NES emulator.

230
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, that's one of the greatest things about it.

231
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We busted out Marvel vs. Capcom 2 the other night.

232
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:19,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

233
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:19,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

234
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:20,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

235
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:23,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So you did do some gaming this week.

236
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:24,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Dan did.

237
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:24,967
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

238
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,248
[SPEAKER_03]: We is in my household.

239
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:27,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

240
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:27,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

241
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:28,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

242
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:50,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Metroid Prime 3 was the only one that's been released on the Wii in this country.

243
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:55,131
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Metroid Prime 1 and 2 were re-released over in Japan, kind of the whole new Wii controls.

244
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:55,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?

245
00:16:56,012 --> 00:17:00,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo announced this week that the Metroid Prime Trilogy will be coming to the U.S.

246
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:03,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means that Metroid Prime will be kind of repackaged.

247
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:10,758
[SPEAKER_06]: The first two games will have the new Wii controls and the whole widescreen graphics, which, you know, I bet a lot of people have mixed feelings about.

248
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:11,819
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you never really bought...

249
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,001
[SPEAKER_06]: One or two, you know, this might be a good way to revisit those games.

250
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:18,503
[SPEAKER_06]: The only bummer is, no news here about Metroid Prime 4.

251
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:25,648
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you have Metroid Prime Trilogy, it kind of insinuates there may not be a Metroid Prime 4.

252
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:31,853
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do have that hope that maybe that's one of the surprises they're going to pull out of E3, but I don't know, I wouldn't bet on it.

253
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:32,773
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

254
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:53,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I do too, and I think a lot of people want that, but I don't know.

255
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really something that might sell?

256
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:00,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Or something we would get not on the DS?

257
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:01,696
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

258
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:02,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Even more the Willa Blend.

259
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:07,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if a new 2D Metroid is going to come out, it's going to just be on the DS.

260
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:08,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of the bummer about it.

261
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:14,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like the DS and all, but I like to play the old school games on my TV as well.

262
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:16,405
[SPEAKER_06]: The big surround sound.

263
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:21,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at some of the games that are 2D, 3D hybrids that were on consoles that were pretty good.

264
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Street Fighter 4 is a perfect example, right?

265
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:27,788
[SPEAKER_06]: 2D fighter, awesome use of 3D in it.

266
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Why couldn't you make a platformer in that kind of vein?

267
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:31,850
[SPEAKER_06]: or a game going back a little bit.

268
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Last we really got for platformers was, I think, LittleBigPlanet.

269
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:36,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a great example.

270
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:39,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say Beautiful Joe, even though that's back on the GameCube.

271
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:42,416
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a good example of 2D platformers.

272
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:43,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shinagogo.

273
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:44,778
[SPEAKER_06]: They can still be a lot of fun.

274
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

275
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:50,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if anything, I think that LittleBigPlanet proved that right away.

276
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:55,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Rene says in chat, Metroid Prime 4, you lost your power-ups again, moron.

277
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:57,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

278
00:18:57,307 --> 00:19:00,070
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times can we go through the same story of, whoops, lost my power-ups.

279
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can use dumb blonde as an excuse, I don't know.

280
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:03,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just make it a prequel.

281
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it another prequel.

282
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:08,157
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw says the next one will be called Metroid Prime 4, Electric Boogaloo.

283
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:09,138
[SPEAKER_06]: One can hope.

284
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,460
[SPEAKER_03]: That would only be if, that was what they should have called Metroid Prime 2.

285
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad from PodCulture says, Metroid Prime 4, Mission to Moscow.

286
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:16,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

287
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:22,467
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to join us and chat live on this Sunday evening, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

288
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is something that I am going to have to get.

289
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,751
[SPEAKER_03]: This is on my must-buy Wii list.

290
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:39,297
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing a haunted house simulator, and it is going to be Ju-on, which is The Grudge.

291
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:43,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, as in the same movie, and probably not including Sarah Michelle Gellar.

292
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It already came out in Japan a few weeks ago.

293
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be localized hopefully pre-Halloween.

294
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:52,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll be able to see it.

295
00:19:52,261 --> 00:20:05,964
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually being consulted on it is Shimizu Takashi who was the guy who directed actually not only the Japanese version but he directed the first American one.

296
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:07,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one is utter shit.

297
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:08,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go see it.

298
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:36,268
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's basically you're using the Wiimote as a flashlight on screen and you go through a warehouse a mannequin factory a hospital just basically all your usual oh my god I'm scared places but it's supposed to have a twist where you can use your second Wiimote to make in game things happen immediately

299
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:46,777
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the actual quote from this article, and I have to read this Rob, is to make in-game events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.

300
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:48,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

301
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a YouTube they're promoting this with that just shows a bunch of scared people.

302
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm all for scary games that are going to make me jump out of my seat.

303
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:55,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, though.

304
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,297
[SPEAKER_06]: The Grudge, you know.

305
00:20:57,337 --> 00:20:57,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on it.

306
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,618
[SPEAKER_06]: The first movie was cool, but.

307
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:01,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the second one, the Japanese movie.

308
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:04,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the TV movie.

309
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff and I were renting movies the other night, and I saw The Grudge 3 on DVD.

310
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And I looked at that, and I was like, lol, there's a third one.

311
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:12,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it American?

312
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:13,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was American Grudge 3.

313
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:14,315
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

314
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:14,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

315
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:16,015
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

316
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:16,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

317
00:21:17,115 --> 00:21:17,536
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

318
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It said The Grudge 3.

319
00:21:19,256 --> 00:21:23,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it was maybe the Japanese one being marketed as an American one.

320
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:24,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but it was there.

321
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:25,238
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

322
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I crap you not.

323
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:34,200
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one's funny because it's about What's-Her-Face doing dirty things with the main character.

324
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny.

325
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Not dirty that way.

326
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,252
[SPEAKER_03]: She's... It's very interesting.

327
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:39,352
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting.

328
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:41,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 2009, direct-to-video.

329
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:42,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out.

330
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:44,235
[SPEAKER_03]: That is shit.

331
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:48,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Stars Shawnee Smith from the Saw series is in it.

332
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

333
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:49,738
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

334
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,535
[SPEAKER_06]: The Grudge 3, I don't know when this came out.

335
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:55,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out 12th of May, so it just came out.

336
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:56,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't exist in my universe.

337
00:21:57,938 --> 00:21:58,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to hear the plot?

338
00:21:59,499 --> 00:21:59,699
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

339
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:10,445
[SPEAKER_06]: A young Japanese woman who holds the key to stopping the evil spirit of Kayako travels to the haunted Chicago apartment from the sequel... I'm not going to read the rest, because you didn't really want to hear it anyway.

340
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:13,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to see if you recognized it from any of the Japanese ones.

341
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,088
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

342
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:18,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghosts don't move from Japan to Chicago.

343
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:20,824
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

344
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:22,766
[SPEAKER_06]: All they have to do is just hop on an airplane.

345
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:24,007
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

346
00:22:25,949 --> 00:22:32,996
[SPEAKER_03]: That's someone who completely just knows crap about, you know, hauntings and anything.

347
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:34,337
[SPEAKER_03]: They usually stay localized.

348
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,353
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in chat says they tend to milk those movies by creating crappy direct-to-DVD sequels.

349
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

350
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's a sequel to Donnie Darko that just came out too that was direct-to-video.

351
00:22:45,858 --> 00:22:46,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't watched that yet either.

352
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:47,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that I want to see.

353
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been actually in writing and production for quite a while now.

354
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:53,065
[SPEAKER_03]: and I really want to see it.

355
00:22:53,145 --> 00:22:58,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Jeff rented that and he wanted to watch it but I was kind of like, I don't remember the first one well enough.

356
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:03,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen the first one in like 10 years because seriously, they're making a sequel to a movie that's like 10 years old.

357
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I need to just go watch the first one.

358
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my copy right here.

359
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:07,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

360
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:08,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the director's edition.

361
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:10,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I need to watch it at some point.

362
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:17,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie and plus, you know, any movie that Drew Barrymore is going to produce and I love Drew Barrymore.

363
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,585
[SPEAKER_03]: She would be like my secret girlfriend if I could.

364
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:21,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

365
00:23:21,326 --> 00:23:21,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

366
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like slitting my wrist now.

367
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:27,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm bleeding my pain on your face.

368
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That was so gothic and tragic.

369
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:17,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote,

370
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,503
[SPEAKER_06]: eBay is actually pulling the auctions on this and Amazon got a notice and takedown and all this fun stuff.

371
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:48,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck though getting all those mom and pop stores that still sell this but still puts a little dent in it and makes it a little bit harder to get if you are looking for these cartridges.

372
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini, though, in chat says, Flashcards are a waste of money.

373
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:55,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi there, SD card slot on DSi.

374
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:58,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Goldanthro admits that Amazon is where he got his R4.

375
00:24:59,336 --> 00:24:59,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

376
00:24:59,717 --> 00:25:02,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not into the hacking thing like a lot of y'all are.

377
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have the patience for that stuff, so I don't really do it.

378
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:10,204
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know this is probably a loss to those that were looking forward to the homebrew.

379
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:15,849
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were using it for piracy, though, well, then, you know, it's hard to feel a little pity for you.

380
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:19,771
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least the homebrew, as far as all that goes, that is kind of a bummer.

381
00:25:21,348 --> 00:25:23,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

382
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:30,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in other news, we have some Sega stuff that makes me particularly happy.

383
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:37,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to be coming out for DS and Wii is Jumbo Safari, actually.

384
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:49,712
[SPEAKER_03]: They are taking the old arcade title and making it pretty and more modern looking and having more stuff happen to make people happy.

385
00:25:55,195 --> 00:26:11,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Animals in Need The DS version of course will work with the stylus and the Wii version will have a lasso gameplay that uses the Wiimote and you can have a 2 player and 4 player party version so there will be more

386
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:15,307
[SPEAKER_06]: OLR has friends in high places

387
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:40,297
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, Sega's got a pretty good track record otherwise, so I'm really excited about Jumbo Safari.

388
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:41,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you, DarkSakura.

389
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:42,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking forward to this?

390
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:44,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

391
00:26:44,884 --> 00:26:45,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to play the game.

392
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want my freaking Planet Harrier.

393
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:48,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you hear me, Sega?

394
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:49,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Whores.

00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:50,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I love you.

00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:54,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying not to speculate on... Bring me swag!

397
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:55,037

400
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:52,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, no, it is not based on the great 80s movie with the same name, so don't get your hopes up.

401
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:56,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And Personal Trainer Walking, also on the DS this week.

00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:16,444

00:30:00,811 --> 00:30:09,537
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Shinsengoku Musou 5 comes out as well on the PlayStation 3, and Agaresenki comes out with a price reduction this week, down to $44.90.

432
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:15,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a game called The Last Guy comes out from Sony Computer themselves.

433
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:17,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not sure, this is an action game.

434
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:21,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what this is a port of, but it looks to be some type of shooter game.

435
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:24,388
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's kind of cool about it, it looks like it uses Google Earth.

436
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, doesn't the backgrounds here look like something you'd see in Google Earth?

437
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a bit.

438
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:30,554
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

439
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:32,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So that comes out this week.

440
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:37,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And looking on other consoles, going over to the Nintendo Wii, just one released this week.

441
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:43,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Ogon no Kizuna comes out this week, which is not a game I've heard of.

442
00:30:45,313 --> 00:30:54,119
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks kind of similar to a Dynasty Warriors-ish type of game, but with a little more role-playing elements mixed in, so check that out.

443
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:59,402
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like, on the PlayStation 2, the Grand Theft Auto games get a price reduction this week.

444
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:00,723
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something to look forward to in Japan.

445
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:08,408
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Nintendo DS, Claymore, Gingan no Majo comes out this week, as well as Days of Memories 3 from SNK.

446
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaia Kukuten Kenji comes out as well.

447
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,853
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a Premium Edition release as well from Capcom.

448
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That, oh, that's, you know what that is?

449
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:19,855
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.

450
00:31:20,095 --> 00:31:20,615
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Rob?

451
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:23,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have to say that your Japanese is improving greatly.

452
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:24,957
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the show's been good.

453
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: This show's been good for something, huh?

454
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

455
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:35,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Also on the Nintendo DS, one more release for you from Sega, Suzumiya Haruhi no Shokuryetsu.

456
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:37,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

457
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:40,359
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

458
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Haruhi is God.

459
00:31:59,295 --> 00:31:59,996
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually she is.

460
00:32:00,896 --> 00:32:01,677
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the premise of the story.

461
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:02,057
[SPEAKER_03]: She's God.

462
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:04,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Quickly looking at the PSP release dates.

463
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Ghost in the Shell.

464
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, these are all movies.

465
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:09,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any games this week.

466
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:14,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Bamboo Blade is the only game it looks to be this week.

467
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:15,687
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out if you'd like.

468
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:17,134
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

469
00:32:17,174 --> 00:32:18,535
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for Japanese release dates.

470
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:25,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back into some gaming news and talk about some music that's been licensed for an upcoming Q Entertainment game.

471
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting about this.

472
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:32,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Tiesto and BT Songs have been licensed for this new game from Q Entertainment.

473
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:41,470
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is called QJ based on some... I guess some folks have been digging around some of the licensing information sites.

474
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:44,052
[SPEAKER_06]: The songs that were licensed.

475
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:46,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Love Comes Again from Tiesto.

476
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:47,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

477
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:52,952
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't know much about this, but if it's Q Entertainment, then it's Mizuguchi.

478
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:55,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I love him.

479
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:58,215
[SPEAKER_06]: There's very few games he's put out that I haven't liked.

480
00:32:58,335 --> 00:32:59,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm even counting 99 Nights.

481
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:04,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgave that game's shortcomings just because I'm a whore for Tetsuya Mizuguchi games.

482
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:05,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

483
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,020
[SPEAKER_06]: More about this game hopefully at E3.

484
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully.

485
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:10,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Fingers crossed.

486
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:14,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Killzone 2, Bullet 4D Interactive Ad, Red Faction, Guerrilla Multiplayer, and Infamous

487
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:58,158
[SPEAKER_03]: PS3 game content Riddick, Dark Athena, Premium Multiplayer Pack We've got some more for Fear 2 Tom Clancy's Hawks, Pain Motorstorm Pacific Rift, Little Big Planet A bunch of stuff for Little Big Planet Guitar Hero World Tour, the European track Rock Band Alice Cooper Pack That's cool Rock Band Taking Back Sunday Kids Don't Follow by The Replacements For PSP games we have Fading Shadows and Creatures Raised in Space

488
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:03,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Creatures raised in space.

489
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:04,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

490
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually logged into Home this week.

491
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:08,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one other game, quote-unquote, I played.

492
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, Home is really expanding.

493
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:16,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Say what you will about whether Home is a game or any fun, all with quotes.

494
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:20,708
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're sure pouring a lot of expansions into it, which I guess is kind of cool.

495
00:34:20,729 --> 00:34:23,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like you have a lot of new stuff to explore if you haven't used it in a while.

496
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So props to them for that.

497
00:34:25,793 --> 00:34:26,233
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new...

498
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:27,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Lord, no.

499
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I unfortunately would have to say no.

500
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,173
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why she's in the kitchen.

501
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,036
[SPEAKER_06]: She's always in the kitchen and never in the bedroom.

502
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:00,858
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

503
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:07,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on with some more news, talking about Sony.

504
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:15,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And, well, it looks like Sony is going to be threatening to sue companies that are publishing images of the PS3.

505
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember we were talking about this last week?

506
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:20,139
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some images leak out of the new PS3.

507
00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:24,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, apparently Sony has been demanding that these companies stop doing this.

508
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:28,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know this all started from, I guess, like their Taiwanese branch or something.

509
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:33,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But, dude, when you threaten to sue, doesn't it kind of prove that the story is true?

510
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:37,467
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my first thought, is like, well, way to give it away, right?

511
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:45,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, otherwise, wouldn't they just release that good old-fashioned line of, oh, Sony will not comment on rumors and speculation at this time.

512
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:47,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Look for our E3 speech.

513
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:51,657
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you stick the lawyers on them, doesn't it kind of prove it to be true?

514
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm crazy.

515
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:59,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about some, I guess, happier news?

516
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:08,696
[SPEAKER_03]: We are actually going to be getting some PlayStation 1 classic games for the PS1 Classic Store.

517
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:15,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been getting information from the ESRB because you know how they love to leak stuff.

518
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And five games are supposed to be coming to the online service.

519
00:36:20,423 --> 00:36:21,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We have...

520
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:24,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Among them, Resident Evil Director's Cut and Metal Gear Solid.

521
00:36:26,606 --> 00:36:34,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Also among those rated is Special Ops Covert Assault and Ranger Elite and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.

522
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:35,572
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

523
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:45,018
[SPEAKER_03]: But dude, Metal Freakin' Gear and Resident Evil Director's Cut, I will have to go along with all the bad voice acting because I can quote that game, you know.

524
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:46,599
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?

525
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this is not Chris's blood.

526
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:50,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

527
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the hidden porn chat will be kind of embedded in the game somewhere.

528
00:36:57,386 --> 00:36:57,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

529
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:58,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember that?

530
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:01,890
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like YouTube out there where they mix and match all the dialogue into something disgusting.

531
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tell you this because I know how you can do it.

532
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:04,853
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a...

533
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:10,800
[SPEAKER_03]: A file reader that let you read the audio and video files off of PlayStation games.

534
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I don't know if you remember, back in the day, the first MP3s out for Bus to Move 2?

535
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:17,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I did those.

536
00:37:18,426 --> 00:37:19,687
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, on my old website.

537
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:24,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the first person that I saw, that I noticed, that had them online, right after the game came out.

538
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:25,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

539
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:53,015
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a little reader program that you can get to rip the files off and then just record them, convert them to WAV or whatever and record them or whatever so that's actually how they pulled all this off there there's also how they got the thing about Maria in Castlevania where an ending that they didn't put into the game of her actually being taken over by the succubus so you can find out, it was a lot easier to find stuff

540
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:54,374
[SPEAKER_06]: RedbookAudio.com

541
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:15,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, but no, I'm saying after that.

542
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,588
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to rip them by hooking them through the mixing board.

543
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:19,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised people didn't do that.

544
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:31,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you could still also pull them off doing the... It wasn't RA, it was like SX or SA reader or something.

545
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:32,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

546
00:38:32,556 --> 00:38:33,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I used to do that back in the day.

547
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:35,177
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really easy to do those.

548
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:37,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

549
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:49,420
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, apparently there's a lot of rumbling going on about what's going on at E3 and possibly a new version of Metal Gear Solid apparently being rumored right now.

550
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:53,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of this has to do with the teaser graphic that showed up on Kojima Productions' website.

551
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:57,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that too

552
00:39:19,805 --> 00:39:23,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised if this is Metal Gear Solid 5 because it seems kind of soon.

553
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:23,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just me?

554
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:26,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Or does it seem like 4 hasn't really been out long enough?

555
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I crazy?

556
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:30,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

557
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:43,239
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, between the magazine, Famitsu Magazine, E3 coming up next week with this countdown seems to be pointing to, and all this, I mean, if there's a time to make a big announcement, I suppose this would be it.

558
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:47,477
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

559
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:08,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

560
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:09,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

561
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:13,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know how while the market is, you know, struck while the iron's hot, pretty much.

562
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't want to put any speculation on it.

563
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:18,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.

564
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:23,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I build myself way too much up to be too excited about something.

565
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to wait for something a little bit more concrete before I make my judgment.

566
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:33,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Comment from your chat room, chat.orange-radio.com Actdeft says, the countdown is a countdown for a countdown for a countdown for a countdown.

567
00:40:33,263 --> 00:40:34,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm getting kind of sick of that crap too.

568
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:36,024
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

569
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:36,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Just announce it.

570
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:37,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Announce it or don't.

571
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:42,046
[SPEAKER_06]: One countdown to a big announcement might be okay.

572
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:44,347
[SPEAKER_06]: But counting down to another countdown is stupid.

573
00:40:45,648 --> 00:40:46,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Very stupid.

574
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:52,455
[SPEAKER_06]: One Night Stands in chat says, was the five outlined a definite five or could it have been an S?

575
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:54,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good comment.

576
00:40:54,055 --> 00:40:59,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are speculating it might have been an S. So maybe it's a new like Metal Gear Solid S type game or something.

577
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:01,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me look at it for a second.

578
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:02,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look at it.

579
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:08,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of like, well, it's one of those like fonts where it's very like pixelated.

580
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:10,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could be a five or an S. Very easy.

581
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:13,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me have a look if it loads.

582
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:16,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not loading.

583
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:17,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Trust me.

584
00:41:17,754 --> 00:41:18,495
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be either one.

585
00:41:20,738 --> 00:41:21,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

586
00:41:22,761 --> 00:41:23,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Other comments.

587
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:27,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Alpha Cananogram in chat says it's just an announcement, which is true.

588
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:28,268
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only an announcement.

589
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:29,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something we should get too excited about.

590
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:31,913
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

591
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about something that might be worth getting excited about?

592
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you don't have iTunes or an iPhone, I guess.

593
00:41:42,182 --> 00:41:45,503
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP may be having a music download service.

594
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:47,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's been thinking about it.

595
00:41:48,243 --> 00:41:51,764
[SPEAKER_03]: They released a survey in January to check for consumer interest.

596
00:41:51,904 --> 00:41:54,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it seems that they are considering on...

597
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:59,231
[SPEAKER_03]: and having other recording companies work with them.

598
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:04,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sony, they have their own music division, but they're just thinking about it right now.

599
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:09,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So they might have a digital music download, but maybe not.

600
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It might happen.

601
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:12,291
[SPEAKER_03]: They're thinking about it.

602
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:15,714
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sending their little slimy tentacles out to feel for it.

603
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:18,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of surprised it's one of those things they haven't been thinking about for quite some time.

604
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:19,537
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

605
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

606
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I use the whole college kid thing.

607
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Who do PSPs sell best to?

608
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:26,642
[SPEAKER_06]: College kids.

609
00:42:27,063 --> 00:42:31,686
[SPEAKER_06]: To replace iPods because they do everything else like games and the internet and all this.

610
00:42:31,726 --> 00:42:35,689
[SPEAKER_06]: So it kind of seems like one of those things that I'm surprised they didn't do this a long freaking time ago.

611
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when you consider the fact what else does Sony have?

612
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:41,575
[SPEAKER_06]: A big music label, right?

613
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:44,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So, why is this taking so long?

614
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:51,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, Sony's got a big, you know, they're big stinky tentacle fingers in the music industry, so why not?

615
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:56,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think, though, that they tend to behave a bit conservatively when they don't need to.

616
00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:58,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you noticed that?

617
00:42:59,628 --> 00:43:00,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, a little bit.

618
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:05,879
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll venture out into something that they think is innovative and new, but with something that they see as tried and true.

619
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, I don't wanna.

620
00:43:09,966 --> 00:43:10,647
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it.

621
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:11,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't wanna.

622
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:21,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Alpha Catanagram in chat says, Sky, they did, it was called Connect, the ATRAC Atarak 3 store, which closed down.

623
00:43:21,772 --> 00:43:22,953
[SPEAKER_06]: They were planning on doing it.

624
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:23,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, interesting.

625
00:43:24,054 --> 00:43:24,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember that.

626
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:27,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that something for just the PSP specifically?

627
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:28,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was that something to, you know...

628
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:32,899
[SPEAKER_06]: There were like a million people that were going to launch something to compete with iTunes.

629
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:34,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And very few of them succeeded.

630
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could say that Napster somewhat succeeded because it's a different business model.

631
00:43:39,102 --> 00:43:44,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the biggest competition for iTunes has probably been, what, Amazon.com maybe?

632
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:49,227
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, what else is out there that's successfully competed with iTunes?

633
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:54,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say successfully, carries a market share even one-tenth the size of what Apple has.

634
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:54,830
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

635
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,290
[SPEAKER_06]: No one.

636
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,311
[SPEAKER_03]: It's practically a monopoly on Apple's part.

637
00:43:57,984 --> 00:44:00,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that's what they're kind of saying there in chat.

638
00:44:00,225 --> 00:44:06,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So is this something new that maybe is trying to launch, and Alpha Caninogram confirms, connect with Sony's iTunes.

639
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:10,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, a million people tried to launch something to compete with iTunes, and they all failed because none of them stood out.

640
00:44:11,352 --> 00:44:17,435
[SPEAKER_06]: It was too much competition amongst each other, and iTunes already had the player to go with the store.

641
00:44:20,086 --> 00:44:23,748
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, oh, I want to read this comment from Marissa Congusto in chat.

642
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:25,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's right.

643
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:25,608
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Marissa.

644
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:30,510
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad thought he was doing me a big favor getting me a mini-disc player instead of an iPod ages ago.

645
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:31,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Face palm.

646
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

647
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:32,671
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel your pain.

648
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:33,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a mini-disc player.

649
00:44:33,892 --> 00:44:35,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an HD DVD player.

650
00:44:35,452 --> 00:44:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: So do I. I actually want a mini-disc player pretty badly.

651
00:44:39,494 --> 00:44:40,855
[SPEAKER_03]: They do some good things with mini-discs.

652
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:41,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

653
00:44:41,655 --> 00:44:44,576
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still, I think, somewhat supported in Japan.

654
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:45,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

655
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:45,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

656
00:44:45,957 --> 00:44:46,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird.

657
00:44:46,924 --> 00:44:50,910
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another example where Sony's tried to go, we're going to do all this new stuff.

658
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Betamax.

659
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:53,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Betamax was better.

660
00:44:54,436 --> 00:44:55,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Minidisc was great.

661
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first thing that they've done in a long time that really caught on, I think that was Blu-ray.

662
00:45:00,794 --> 00:45:03,937
[SPEAKER_06]: OneNightStands in chat asks, wasn't Zune a competitor for iTunes?

663
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:18,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Zune was a competitor for the iPod, and certainly Microsoft launched their own store to go with it, but it didn't really go... One could argue with me whether it was successful or not, but I think it's pretty clear iTunes has by far the most dominant share.

664
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:19,069
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

665
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:21,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't really put a blip on the radar of what iTunes has.

666
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:25,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether they're still supporting that whole Microsoft marketplace or what, I don't know.

667
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:27,075
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

668
00:45:28,096 --> 00:45:30,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about some happy, happy, happy news?

669
00:45:31,115 --> 00:45:34,197
[SPEAKER_06]: And just a moment, let me talk about this PSP rental service here real quick.

670
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:49,263
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a PSP survey that was hinting that a rental service might be on its way to the PSP, which is kind of interesting because we know that the PSP, you know, there's this new PSP coming out that nobody's confirming, but we all know it's probably happening.

671
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:51,284
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be announced at E3 this year.

672
00:45:51,964 --> 00:45:53,625
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a diskless PSP.

673
00:45:54,955 --> 00:45:55,776
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

674
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:29,549
[SPEAKER_06]: VideoGaming, where instead of a company boohooing and yelling and bitching and screaming about blockbusters and Hollywood videos and places that rent video games and how they chip into game sales, a company deciding to, well, hell, we'll do game rentals of our own.

675
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:31,590
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't beat them, join them.

676
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll compete with them directly.

677
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:35,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

678
00:46:35,888 --> 00:46:39,910
[SPEAKER_06]: If this actually happens, that could be kind of interesting.

679
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why not?

680
00:46:41,191 --> 00:46:44,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Apple has proved that it can happen with the movies on iTunes.

681
00:46:44,573 --> 00:46:47,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not rent games through a similar service?

682
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,196
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be big if it's true.

683
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:54,439
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's all kind of a big grain of salt right now because a survey isn't the official word, but it could be very interesting.

684
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:55,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it could be.

685
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:57,761
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

686
00:46:58,922 --> 00:46:59,462
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have.

687
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:01,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did have my happy news.

688
00:47:02,324 --> 00:47:02,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

689
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been confirmed!

690
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:07,651
[SPEAKER_03]: We are getting Tatsunoko vs. Capcom in the U.S.

691
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:12,416
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nintendo Power Scan was true.

692
00:47:13,137 --> 00:47:20,726
[SPEAKER_03]: And Capcom said on their Twitter that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is being localized for a U.S.

693
00:47:20,806 --> 00:47:21,166
[SPEAKER_03]: release.

694
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:24,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, U.S., Canada, North America, whatever.

695
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:44,237
[SPEAKER_03]: and the quote says Cat is officially out of the bag on Capcom Mystery Game number one and linked to the scan and then there was also one made by Capcom Unity on their blog but there's one more mystery game they should be having at E3 so I hope it doesn't suck

696
00:47:45,547 --> 00:47:48,408
[SPEAKER_06]: and Renie in chat is yelling out with online and bug fixes.

697
00:47:48,508 --> 00:47:49,628
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I hope that's true.

698
00:47:50,088 --> 00:47:50,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

699
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:52,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially if it's true they have to cut back a few characters.

700
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:54,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then, hell, let's make it better.

701
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:57,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But the characters that were listed on there aren't even in the damn game anyway.

702
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:59,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

703
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:02,571
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some back and forth last week on whether those characters were really going to be there or not.

704
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:07,012
[SPEAKER_03]: The only Gatchaman characters that were in the game is Ken and June.

705
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:08,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe wasn't in it.

706
00:48:08,212 --> 00:48:11,773
[SPEAKER_03]: If Joe was in it, I'd be screaming because I'd want him in the release.

707
00:48:12,533 --> 00:48:12,673
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

708
00:48:16,414 --> 00:48:30,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini in chat says Sky, Mystery Game number 2 is Mega Man Legends 3 on Wii God, I hope you're If you're lying to me So help me God That would be amazing though if that's the Mystery Game I would love that But it seems like it's all speculation to me

709
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:33,374
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

710
00:48:57,495 --> 00:48:58,456
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

711
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:22,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is supposed to have a micro SD slot, SIM card tray, support for Bluetooth headphones in it, some optical digital output in there as well.

712
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:29,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it will actually work with Zunex Originals, Xbox Live and OnLive ready game streaming.

713
00:49:29,306 --> 00:49:33,950
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be a 32 gigabyte flash drive and the battery is built in and rechargeable.

714
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will bake scones.

715
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,152
[SPEAKER_06]: It just well might.

716
00:49:38,013 --> 00:49:38,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And run Linux.

717
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:39,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

718
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:41,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there will be more info about this at E3.

719
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:45,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I dare whoever gets one of these to put Linux on it.

720
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:47,502
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make me go squee for a little bit.

721
00:49:48,463 --> 00:49:51,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is something that probably won't make people squee.

722
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:54,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, to be completely honest, I don't think anyone will really freaking give a damn.

723
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Watchmen, the end is nigh.

724
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:01,714
[SPEAKER_03]: The second episode of it is not coming out for PC.

725
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:03,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And a sad trombone, I guess.

726
00:50:04,456 --> 00:50:06,097
[SPEAKER_03]: It will come out on Xbox 360 and PS3 soon.

727
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:18,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But, of course, it's also going to be selling a special edition that has this and the first episode on it.

728
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:23,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Warner is doing The Watchmen, The End is Nigh, Complete Experience.

729
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:28,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the PS3 versions and the director's cut of the film on Blu-ray.

730
00:50:28,552 --> 00:50:33,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that'll be worth buying because the movie was freaking good, but meh, the rest of it, meh.

731
00:50:33,455 --> 00:50:33,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

732
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:35,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

733
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:38,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I can fart better games.

734
00:50:39,396 --> 00:50:40,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, somebody out there might care.

735
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,119
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know.

736
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:57,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Question in the chat room that I kind of like, and this is a very unpronounceable name, and I'm sorry, but RLBX327 asks, how would the new PSP work if a person does not have an internet connection?

737
00:50:57,447 --> 00:50:58,247
[SPEAKER_06]: How would that work?

738
00:50:58,947 --> 00:51:01,729
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great question, one that we'd all like to know the answer to as well.

739
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:03,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping we'll get some results at E3.

740
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:11,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if maybe you can take it into a game store and buy things that way, but I guess the assumption is everybody has an internet connection at this point.

741
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:13,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the DS download stations.

742
00:51:13,174 --> 00:51:14,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be something similar?

743
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:14,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess?

744
00:51:15,476 --> 00:51:19,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's definitely ways around it, but I think they just assume everybody has an internet connection.

745
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:22,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And even dial-up, if you have to.

746
00:51:22,463 --> 00:51:23,704
[SPEAKER_06]: But who has dial-up anymore?

747
00:51:24,245 --> 00:51:27,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess, well, I shouldn't say that, because there'll be somebody that sends me a message.

748
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, I have dial-up.

749
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:29,230
[SPEAKER_06]: My parents have dial-up.

750
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:34,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but, jeez, my iPod 3G's faster than their internet at home on dial-up.

751
00:51:35,276 --> 00:52:00,017
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess some areas still aren't wired for broadband But I guess you could still use a PSP Go on dial-up But maybe Sony is only marketing to those people that have internet connections I mean, let's face it, a vast portion of the population has an internet connection that's fast If every one of them bought a PSP Go, they would do very well So why bother catering to those that don't have an internet connection, right?

752
00:52:02,114 --> 00:52:03,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is the modern world.

753
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's supposed to be connected.

754
00:52:05,577 --> 00:52:07,459
[SPEAKER_06]: SuperXLink in chat has an interesting comment.

755
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:09,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to a free Wi-Fi spot.

756
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:12,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when... I think it was Nintendo did that at all the McDonald's?

757
00:52:12,804 --> 00:52:13,945
[SPEAKER_06]: The McDonald's or something like that?

758
00:52:14,345 --> 00:52:14,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

759
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:20,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, some more stories involving Capcom, actually, and talking about E3.

760
00:52:21,531 --> 00:52:22,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

761
00:52:43,215 --> 00:53:11,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Fully to attending the E3 They are still kind of contemplating What to do about the swine flu outbreak That's going on in Keihanshin, which is where Capcom's main office is in Japan Very interesting And what they're already saying is that because of this Dead Rising 2 is not going to be showing up at E3 Capcom has confirmed that Dead Rising 2 Not going to be there at E3 And this has to do with Japanese government restrictions And the advisory in Japan right now

762
00:53:12,461 --> 00:53:23,388
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, doesn't just end there, Square, Koei, also not attending E3 from their Japanese branches because of apparently swine flu concerns.

763
00:53:23,948 --> 00:53:36,356
[SPEAKER_06]: A quote from an article on GamePolitics.com, quote, Square Enix has canceled plans for its Kingdom Hearts team to attend the show, whilst Koei has confirmed that an unspecified number of its Japanese employees will not be traveling to the event.

764
00:53:37,896 --> 00:53:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sad face.

765
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:40,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very sad.

766
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:43,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And also incredibly freaking stupid.

767
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:46,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It is incredibly stupid to still be concerned about the swine flu.

768
00:53:46,157 --> 00:53:46,717
[SPEAKER_03]: My God.

769
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,679
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people contracted swine flu?

770
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:49,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, 800?

771
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:50,401
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people died?

772
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:50,401
10?

773
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe 10 at most.

774
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,006
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was a couple, granted there was a couple thousand that got swine flu.

775
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:56,868
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many people get regular flu?

776
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:57,969
[SPEAKER_06]: All the time.

777
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:59,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking shit.

778
00:54:00,044 --> 00:54:01,584
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

779
00:54:22,731 --> 00:54:31,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, I'm just... So the fact that stupid swine flu or H1N1 or whatever the fuck you want to call it is ruining E3.

780
00:54:31,645 --> 00:54:32,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck people.

781
00:54:32,988 --> 00:54:34,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I say we dedicate the FUs of the week to this.

782
00:54:50,982 --> 00:54:57,924
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week goes to just those stupid people who are willing to believe any and everything that they see on TV, on the internet.

783
00:54:58,244 --> 00:55:00,365
[SPEAKER_03]: You gullible, gullible fucking sheep.

784
00:55:01,805 --> 00:55:03,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you get swine flu.

785
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get it.

786
00:55:04,766 --> 00:55:07,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you get swine flu of the colon.

787
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:12,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And can do nothing but shit viruses or something.

788
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:14,508
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I wish.

789
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:16,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you stupid people.

790
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

791
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:20,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I want Dick Cheney to shut up.

792
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want people to shut up.

793
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I want people to shut up.

794
00:55:27,245 --> 00:55:27,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

795
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:29,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock it the fuck off.

796
00:55:29,968 --> 00:55:30,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I talk?

797
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:39,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I want real news on my TV, I want real news, I want what's actually going on in the world I want to know what's going on outside of America, do you hear me CNN?

798
00:56:01,388 --> 00:56:07,929
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why BBC America's news owns yours completely and utterly.

799
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, it just does.

800
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:10,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like CNN.

801
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:15,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I like CNN much better than Fox News because Fox News is the shit that rats shit.

802
00:56:15,851 --> 00:56:16,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

803
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:19,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the feces of slugs.

804
00:56:20,052 --> 00:56:21,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate slugs.

805
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you get more accuracy.

806
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:25,833
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have a political talk show.

807
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:27,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a blog whenever I post on it.

808
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:30,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, seriously.

809
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:39,443
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I think it's completely sad that to find out anything that's actually going on in America and in the world, I have to go to the BBC.

810
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:46,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be CNN or one of the good networks reporting our shit properly.

811
00:56:47,526 --> 00:56:53,368
[SPEAKER_03]: So, big finger to our American media.

812
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,789
[SPEAKER_03]: A big finger to the gullible people who believe it.

813
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:58,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,

814
00:57:00,544 --> 00:57:13,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a magnet on the door of my refrigerator that says listen to the effect of respect people that seek the truth doubt those who find it wow can I talk now?

815
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:28,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually don't have a lot so that's fine you went a little long because I don't really have anything my FU goes to drama I'm sick of it and I choose not to be around it so whatever I got better things to do

816
00:57:28,922 --> 00:57:29,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

817
00:57:30,243 --> 00:57:30,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Better things.

818
00:57:31,924 --> 00:57:33,045
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the FUs of the week.

819
00:57:33,105 --> 00:57:34,867
[SPEAKER_06]: How about something a little more pleasant?

820
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:37,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though this might drive us to some FUs, too.

821
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:40,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently our mailbag is quite thin this week, and that's very sad.

822
00:57:41,152 --> 00:57:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

823
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:48,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And the one and only DarkSakura will read them, as she'll do right now.

824
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,059
[SPEAKER_06]: What, we have like one, two maybe?

825
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,282
[SPEAKER_03]: One, actually, that came in while we were broadcasting from Cheeseburger.

826
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:54,923
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

827
00:57:55,816 --> 00:57:58,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, I'm curious about your opinions on the new Star Trek movie.

828
00:57:58,918 --> 00:57:59,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it three times.

829
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:01,320
[SPEAKER_03]: In a theater.

830
00:58:02,001 --> 00:58:05,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 15, and I'm obsessed with Star Wars, but I never really saw anything in Star Trek.

831
00:58:05,803 --> 00:58:10,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the movie two weeks ago with no expectations, because I'd never experienced anything Star Trek before.

832
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:14,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I was blown away, and it was the first movie I'd ever gone to where everyone clapped at the end.

833
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, all three times I saw it, people clapped.

834
00:58:17,992 --> 00:58:23,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew I wanted to see it again as I was leaving the theater, which I did yesterday and plan to again next week.

835
00:58:23,175 --> 00:58:27,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I plan on buying the old shows and movies on eBay to catch up on some of the older stuff.

836
00:58:27,857 --> 00:58:33,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I've researched some stuff about the movie and I'd like to say Red Shirt Guy dies if you know what that means.

837
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:35,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You're awesome if you don't go look it up.

838
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,181
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a spoiler, just something they threw in from the old series.

839
00:58:38,342 --> 00:58:40,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, okay, I will give you the rule right now.

840
00:58:41,043 --> 00:58:45,085
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're wearing a red shirt and no one knows who you are, you are going to die.

841
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:50,013
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, next generation is yellow, but security officer, die, red shirt.

842
00:58:51,355 --> 00:58:56,805
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, they sell on ThinkGeek a red ringer t-shirt that says expendable on it in the Star Trek font.

843
00:58:59,433 --> 00:59:02,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go ahead and say something, and I've said this before.

844
00:59:02,256 --> 00:59:04,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not a Trekkie originally.

845
00:59:04,698 --> 00:59:05,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a Whovian.

846
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:20,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up watching Doctor Who on PBS and not watching Star Trek, although I've seen a number of the original episodes in almost all of Next Generation and maybe a smattering here of DS9 and Voyager, and I watched three episodes of Enterprise and decided it was shit.

847
00:59:22,048 --> 00:59:22,789
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

848
00:59:40,982 --> 01:00:09,438
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know it's I actually you know I purchased something recently that was like the best four episodes of Star Trek ever the original series and they're great episodes and I want to say if you want to get a feel for the original series that will give you a decent smattering of what to expect just get this it's four episodes and among them are the one of them is Trouble with Tribbles which is supposed to be like the big favorite and I love that episode and

849
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it's just fantastic.

850
01:00:14,941 --> 01:00:18,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, go get some of those little samples first.

851
01:00:18,684 --> 01:00:19,785
[SPEAKER_03]: See how you feel about it.

852
01:00:21,145 --> 01:00:22,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Next Generation.

853
01:00:22,426 --> 01:00:25,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back and watching a bunch of it, though, you're going to find it really dated.

854
01:00:26,629 --> 01:00:31,532
[SPEAKER_03]: The old stuff will hold up because you expect it to be old, but Next Generation, we're talking about when I was early high school, 1990.

855
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:34,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Next Generation now, believe it or not, is getting to be 20 years old.

856
01:00:35,155 --> 01:00:35,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

857
01:00:35,435 --> 01:00:36,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like, oh boy.

858
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

859
01:00:40,439 --> 01:01:06,604
[SPEAKER_03]: DS9 you know I didn't watch much of it I'm actually going to be going back and watching a bunch of it just because from what I understand it's probably the best of the series Voyager has its ups and downs I've seen crap episodes I've seen great episodes and yeah I'm sorry Jerry Ryan is hot but Enterprise is like I keep expecting Scott Bakula to jump I'm sorry to leap because he was you know from Quantum Leap I do want to remind though Jerry Ryan didn't show up until season 4 no that's right so

860
01:01:08,007 --> 01:01:10,290
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Star Trek, me personally, loved it.

861
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:11,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Loved the movie, thought it was great.

862
01:01:11,952 --> 01:01:15,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely kind of, J.J.

863
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:21,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Abrams definitely said, I am fucking turning this car around right the fuck now and taking it in a new direction, but it needed it.

864
01:01:22,586 --> 01:01:23,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It needed it.

865
01:01:23,587 --> 01:01:25,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope we get a new series out of it.

866
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:36,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even if the series isn't related to the movie, I hope it invigorates interest in Star Trek enough that we do get the uber nerdy series in the Voyager, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine canon.

867
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:38,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I want to see a new show like that.

868
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:39,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not Enterprise.

869
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:41,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'll tell you what.

870
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:45,665
[SPEAKER_03]: They've confirmed writing on the sequel now and got the whole cast.

871
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:51,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled about that too, but where's my weekly dose?

872
01:01:51,317 --> 01:01:52,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see that too.

873
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:53,260
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be very exciting.

874
01:01:53,641 --> 01:01:56,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I could watch the movie a million times in a theater like DarkSakura does.

875
01:01:56,947 --> 01:02:00,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'd see it one more time, but I'll just buy it on Blu-ray when it comes out.

876
01:02:01,733 --> 01:02:03,274
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

877
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:29,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to do it by season.

878
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:30,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

879
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:30,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

880
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:31,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So, original season?

881
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:35,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in the movie, I'm going to say right now, Scotty.

882
01:02:35,907 --> 01:02:37,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I'm sorry, I love Simon Pegg.

883
01:02:38,148 --> 01:02:41,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Between him and Carl Urban, I'm sorry, that made the movie for me.

884
01:02:42,649 --> 01:02:44,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl Urban's McCoy was perfect.

885
01:02:45,189 --> 01:02:45,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh my god.

886
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:47,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Southern guy.

887
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,830
[SPEAKER_03]: He just did the accent and everything just right.

888
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me really happy.

889
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:56,111
[SPEAKER_03]: But, Simon Pegg as Scotty was just like, Actually, he was probably my favorite in the original series, too.

890
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:57,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

891
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:00,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Next Generation, it depends.

892
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:02,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as a kid, I was that age.

893
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:04,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a Wesley fangirl.

894
01:03:04,935 --> 01:03:20,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But getting older, it's all about Q. All about Q. I love Q. I love every bit of Q. So I'd actually have to say Q for Voyager as well since we've had Q. And I think that Seven and the Doctor are funny together.

895
01:03:20,885 --> 01:03:22,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Doctor was probably my favorite in Voyager.

896
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:28,511
[SPEAKER_03]: For DS9, I'd actually have to say Jadzia or Worf.

897
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:30,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked Odo, though.

898
01:03:31,734 --> 01:03:33,656
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite was Guinan.

899
01:03:33,896 --> 01:03:35,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Guinan will always be my favorite.

900
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:35,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Whoopi.

901
01:03:35,697 --> 01:03:35,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

902
01:03:36,098 --> 01:03:36,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Whoopi.

903
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:37,319
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

904
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:37,719
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

905
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,881
[SPEAKER_06]: We're being way too... This is a video game show.

906
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:41,322
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will say this.

907
01:03:41,662 --> 01:03:45,926
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that Star Trek is being made into this MMO, please don't suck.

908
01:03:46,426 --> 01:03:47,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't suck.

909
01:03:47,287 --> 01:03:49,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, I'm still making the race the Olarians.

910
01:03:50,612 --> 01:03:55,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, if there's God out there, do not let this game suck.

911
01:03:55,435 --> 01:03:58,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right now, Star Trek is riding such a high, high wave.

912
01:03:58,937 --> 01:04:00,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is so much potential.

913
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:05,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, there is so much they could fuck up beyond all belief.

914
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am praying that this game doesn't suck.

915
01:04:08,003 --> 01:04:10,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I will be leaving all my other MMOs to play it.

916
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to quote GameGuru on this, because honestly, I fully agree with this.

917
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:17,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl Urbans McCoy makes me wonder if reincarnation exists.

918
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:19,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

919
01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:19,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

920
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:21,864
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

921
01:04:22,765 --> 01:04:23,525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the mailbag.

922
01:04:23,545 --> 01:04:27,107
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

923
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:28,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guys, your call soon.

924
01:04:29,608 --> 01:04:33,491
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, we have a little bit of gaming news for you guys and, of course, the classic game of the week.

925
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:34,811
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't forgot that yet.

926
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:38,754
[SPEAKER_06]: But one more news story for you guys has to do with Forza Motorsport 3.

927
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:40,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I think y'all know it's coming.

928
01:04:41,296 --> 01:04:42,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all know it had to happen.

929
01:04:42,718 --> 01:04:55,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough, the German retail version of Amazon.com called Amazon.de has listed Forza Motorsport 3, Prima's official game guide, out on September 30th.

930
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:56,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoops!

931
01:04:57,608 --> 01:04:59,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Forza Motorsport 3 is coming at some point.

932
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:26,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Comments in chat.

933
01:05:26,788 --> 01:05:27,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't you read my email?

934
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:29,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you sent it too late.

935
01:05:30,351 --> 01:05:30,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

936
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:31,632
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll read it next week.

937
01:05:32,392 --> 01:05:32,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

938
01:05:33,113 --> 01:05:33,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

939
01:05:33,693 --> 01:05:35,594
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to the email.

940
01:05:35,654 --> 01:05:36,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the emails.

941
01:05:36,215 --> 01:05:36,835
[SPEAKER_06]: We already went to the emails.

942
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:38,276
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to the Classic Game of the Week now.

943
01:05:38,696 --> 01:05:43,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura likes to dig through the archives and find a game she thinks y'all ought to be playing.

944
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:44,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it is.

945
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Week.

946
01:05:48,002 --> 01:05:49,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic Game of the Week is beer pong.

947
01:05:50,044 --> 01:05:50,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

948
01:05:50,564 --> 01:05:50,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

949
01:05:51,265 --> 01:05:53,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually DuckTales.

950
01:05:53,606 --> 01:05:53,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo-hoo.

951
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:54,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo-hoo.

952
01:05:56,938 --> 01:05:58,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about damn time I picked this one.

953
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:01,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't actually put in a gameplay one up because I wanted the best music in the game.

954
01:06:01,741 --> 01:06:03,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the moon music.

955
01:06:03,862 --> 01:06:05,162
Sorry, moon level had the best music.

956
01:06:19,196 --> 01:06:36,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so anyway, um, it is, um, of course, based off of the, uh, the Disney TV show, and it came out on Nintendo in 1989, and so you basically go around as Scrooge McDuck, um, who is going around to collect treasures all over the world, and the moon!

957
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:42,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out on Game Boy, and it has nothing to do with DuckTales Quest for Gold.

958
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:49,915
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, this is really one of the top Capcom games from the Nintendo.

959
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:57,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually had Tokoro Fujiwara and Yuki-chan's papa.

960
01:06:59,397 --> 01:07:01,878
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta read the credits on some of the old Capcom games, I love it.

961
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, really tight to play.

962
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:10,747
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use Scrooge's cane as a weapon and a PocoStick and was non-linear.

963
01:07:11,588 --> 01:07:19,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so basically you're going around and you're helping NPCs and whacking enemies with a cane and telling them to get off your lawn or whatever.

964
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:25,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you can actually play any of the levels in order, like I said, non-linear.

965
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:40,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you have a boss you have to fight at the end of each level, two hidden treasures, um, there's a golden ring in the African Mines and a golden mirror in the moon level, and after you've done all that, you go to Transylvania for some reason to do the boss fight.

966
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can keep going back and unlock different parts of levels and do different stuff.

967
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got basically your DuckTales characters.

968
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:56,763
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Scrooge, you have Kiwi, Dewey, and Lily, Webby, Gizmo, Duck, Launchpad, McQuack, Gyro, Gearloose, Ms.

969
01:07:56,823 --> 01:08:04,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Beakley, Bubba, Magica, Dispel, who is in Traptopania, Flintheart, Glomgold, and the Beagle Boys.

970
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:19,771
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you also have an alternate ending in the NES version where if you finish the game with 10 million dollars and have both of the hidden treasures then you will have...

971
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:30,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the news article come up with Scrooge winning, but he has a crown on his head, and a paper stating that he has stunned the world with his discovery of two lost treasures.

972
01:08:31,634 --> 01:08:32,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

973
01:08:34,157 --> 01:08:36,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, it was by, um, Capcom.

974
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:38,381
[SPEAKER_03]: There were actually, there was actually a beta version that was out, too.

975
01:08:39,382 --> 01:08:44,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, actually we were releasing the Consumer's Guide Hot Tip for, uh, coolest Nintendo's game.

976
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:49,245
[SPEAKER_03]: At different levels, there was the Jungle, Ghost House, Underground, Snow Mountain, and Moon Surface.

977
01:08:49,805 --> 01:08:51,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Hamburgers were your power-ups instead of ice cream.

978
01:08:52,706 --> 01:08:59,648
[SPEAKER_03]: There, the coffins in the Ghost House had, um, uh, crosses on them, the coffins, sorry, had crosses on them instead of R.E.P.,

979
01:09:01,748 --> 01:09:11,775
[SPEAKER_03]: um although if you look in the NES Atlas um there are pictures of the original uh the moon music has a slower tempo music and I've actually heard it it's actually pretty good

980
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:16,543
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ghost House had a different music track, and Gizmoduck went by Roboduck.

981
01:09:18,465 --> 01:09:22,209
[SPEAKER_03]: In the French version, it was called La Bande à Pichot.

982
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:26,394
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same DuckTales thing.

983
01:09:26,974 --> 01:09:33,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Famicom version was called One Paku Daku Yume Boken, which is Naughty Duck's Dream Adventure.

984
01:09:36,228 --> 01:09:38,392
[SPEAKER_03]: and it didn't have all the censorship.

985
01:09:39,414 --> 01:09:41,658
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a DuckTales 2 game.

986
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:43,061
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not as popular.

987
01:09:43,968 --> 01:09:50,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it really, though, is... And by the way, Yuki-chan's papa is Yoshihiro Sakaguchi.

988
01:09:51,691 --> 01:09:53,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yay.

989
01:09:55,372 --> 01:09:59,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really one of the classic, classic, classics.

990
01:09:59,954 --> 01:10:02,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, I had to play the moon level music first.

991
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:05,156
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the identifiable stage.

992
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:06,837
[SPEAKER_03]: You play the beginning of that.

993
01:10:07,497 --> 01:10:11,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyone who knows their gaming history will be able to point that right out.

994
01:10:11,419 --> 01:10:11,779
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

995
01:10:11,799 --> 01:10:11,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

996
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, maybe that'll be Capcom's surprise announcement.

997
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:21,352
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a secondary surprise announcement, they're supposed to make at E3, right?

998
01:10:21,392 --> 01:10:23,192
[SPEAKER_06]: How about DuckTales 3 on the Wii?

999
01:10:24,452 --> 01:10:27,633
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the sound you would hear across the world, fanboys shitting their pants.

1000
01:10:28,533 --> 01:10:28,994
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1001
01:10:30,734 --> 01:10:38,396
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, also, just to say, you know, if we want to even look at any more of Yoshihiro Sakaguchi's games, we have 1943, well, 1943 Kai.

1002
01:10:43,812 --> 01:11:04,170
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Final Fight, Legendary Wings, Forgotten Worlds, Mega Man, Mega Man 2 We have Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2, did sound design, Warriors of Fate So, pretty cool Very cool OneNightStands asks, hey DarkSakura, exactly why was this such a great game?

1003
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:06,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved it as a kid, but it plays like a lot of other platformers

1004
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:10,394
[SPEAKER_03]: It just really, it's all of the elements combined.

1005
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:13,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, when you look at everything together, it's all those pieces.

1006
01:11:13,734 --> 01:11:18,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, there were a lot of platformers on the NES, but I think you had so many things falling into place on this one.

1007
01:11:18,735 --> 01:11:21,936
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a pretty good game, which is very important.

1008
01:11:21,956 --> 01:11:23,136
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a great license.

1009
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:26,137
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go back and do your favorite levels as much as you wanted to.

1010
01:11:26,397 --> 01:11:26,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1011
01:11:26,777 --> 01:11:30,858
[SPEAKER_06]: You had, you know, it was kind of like that Mega Man mixed with...

1012
01:11:31,698 --> 01:11:34,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, like Mario style platformer and great music.

1013
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:36,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just everything kind of fell into place with this game.

1014
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:45,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one other reason, think about all the crap movie and cartoon and TV show tie-in games you have.

1015
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:46,781
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I know, right?

1016
01:11:46,881 --> 01:11:48,661
[SPEAKER_06]: DuckTales breaks that mold.

1017
01:11:48,681 --> 01:11:54,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that might be one reason why people love it so much is that DuckTales was actually a pretty enjoyable game at the time it came out.

1018
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:55,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think so.

1019
01:11:56,883 --> 01:11:57,483
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be my best answer.

1020
01:11:57,503 --> 01:11:58,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I really agree with that.

1021
01:11:58,922 --> 01:12:02,065
[SPEAKER_03]: That, Rob, dear friend, is a proper assessment

1022
01:12:26,345 --> 01:12:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have more questions you want to ask us, our Skype line is open right now.

1023
01:12:30,288 --> 01:12:34,151
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1024
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:35,532
[SPEAKER_06]: You can call right now and give us a call.

1025
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:38,474
[SPEAKER_06]: In the meantime, I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories.

1026
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:39,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have anything.

1027
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:40,796
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think DarkSakura would have anything.

1028
01:12:40,936 --> 01:12:41,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually... You never know.

1029
01:12:43,178 --> 01:12:43,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, gosh.

1030
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:49,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

1031
01:12:49,923 --> 01:12:50,483
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a call.

1032
01:12:50,543 --> 01:12:52,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on... Shut that thing up.

1033
01:12:52,465 --> 01:12:53,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1034
01:12:53,525 --> 01:12:53,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1035
01:12:55,168 --> 01:12:56,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

1036
01:12:57,129 --> 01:12:57,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Spazinator.

1037
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,530
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind tonight?

1038
01:13:00,932 --> 01:13:01,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

1039
01:13:02,573 --> 01:13:08,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to join the IRC chat, but unfortunately it won't work on my PlayStation 3.

1040
01:13:11,798 --> 01:13:19,683
[SPEAKER_01]: If you heard the Tale in a Bible show, I was asking about possibly buying an arcade machine.

1041
01:13:22,048 --> 01:13:26,256
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm specifically looking for is a classic game from the 80s up until the mid-90s.

1042
01:13:34,227 --> 01:13:35,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking to buy a specific game?

1043
01:13:35,288 --> 01:13:38,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking to collect or are you just looking to play?

1044
01:13:38,029 --> 01:13:38,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I collect.

1045
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:08,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go eBay, honestly.

1046
01:14:08,488 --> 01:14:09,849
[SPEAKER_03]: eBay or flea markets.

1047
01:14:10,349 --> 01:14:11,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even like Craigslist.

1048
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:17,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Denios here in Roosevelt, Sacramento area, they sell old arcade cabinets.

1049
01:14:17,213 --> 01:14:24,158
[SPEAKER_03]: You can even check some of the entertainment companies that rent out the games and ask if they're putting anything for sale.

1050
01:14:24,378 --> 01:14:27,360
[SPEAKER_03]: eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, we've come to them that way.

1051
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:27,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Newspapers

1052
01:14:57,382 --> 01:15:24,041
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you buy a game from the west coast you know you're going to have to pay an arm and a leg in shipping fees so you probably want to stick to things I mean you can certainly find your widest selection there on eBay but you would definitely want to stick to things like Craigslist and things that are going to be a little more local in your areas that you don't have to pay that obscene shipping fee you have the perk of having New York City not too too far away if you're especially willing to drive and pick something up with a pickup truck you can probably get some good deals

1053
01:15:25,273 --> 01:15:28,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the thing is, I never drove a day in my life.

1054
01:15:28,854 --> 01:15:30,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I never bothered to get my license.

1055
01:15:31,855 --> 01:15:52,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think, well, I don't have any relatives that really live in the area that have a driver's license and have enough free time on their hands that would be willing to essentially take me out to wherever, you know,

1056
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:57,608
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick up our kid gathering and drive her back to my place.

1057
01:15:58,069 --> 01:15:58,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's fair.

1058
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:02,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you don't have a license yourself, it's going to be kind of harder to get around and stuff.

1059
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:06,411
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may have to fork over those shipping fees, but just be prepared.

1060
01:16:06,451 --> 01:16:16,233
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be shipping fees, and sometimes they're as much as the games are themselves because you're talking about sending a gigantic cabinet, which basically has to go on the back of a truck.

1061
01:16:16,413 --> 01:16:20,514
[SPEAKER_06]: You are going to be spending a couple hundred dollars on shipping, so that's something you've got to prepare yourself for when shopping.

1062
01:16:20,554 --> 01:16:23,575
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you can afford it, if that's within your budget, go for it.

1063
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:35,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, if I do, you know, decide to go forward with this and get one, it'll probably be probably a few months before I get it.

1064
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:42,517
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I kind of figured, you know, this would probably go hand in hand with, you know, my councils.

1065
01:16:42,537 --> 01:16:46,160
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it would be a nice conversation piece to talk about.

1066
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but, you know, I kind of miss...

1067
01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:54,931
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole arcade experience that I used to have when I was a little kid, going to the pizzeria to play games.

1068
01:16:54,951 --> 01:16:56,051
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get one game.

1069
01:16:56,071 --> 01:16:58,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's people that would spend a lot of money to have

1070
01:17:18,738 --> 01:17:21,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have like a top five wish list.

1071
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:22,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be like...

1072
01:17:44,355 --> 01:17:53,271
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Combat 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and then of course, Killer Instinct 2, and...

1073
01:17:57,551 --> 01:18:02,054
[SPEAKER_01]: and then like the Neo Geo MVS, the four-slot one.

1074
01:18:02,294 --> 01:18:04,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that, you know what?

1075
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:05,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Look into that.

1076
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:15,780
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like it might be a great option for you is those Neo Geo cabinets because of the fact you can fit like four games in there and that way you get that classic collectible thing mixed in with, hey, I have more than just one game in here.

1077
01:18:16,181 --> 01:18:17,301
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be a good thing to look into.

1078
01:18:17,361 --> 01:18:23,264
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good news is with those fighting games, they made so many of them, especially Street Fighter IIs, I'm sure you wouldn't have a hard time finding one at all.

1079
01:18:23,664 --> 01:18:24,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Finding a working one,

1080
01:18:25,506 --> 01:18:26,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thank you very much.

1081
01:18:26,186 --> 01:18:26,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1082
01:18:26,547 --> 01:18:26,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodbye.

1083
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Rene says Prop Cycle, the poor man's DDR

1084
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:23,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Vid Power says Simpsons Arcade and let's see what else is there.

1085
01:19:23,997 --> 01:19:26,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Yes said I would kill for a Super Scope cabinet.

1086
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:27,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1087
01:19:30,121 --> 01:19:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: We just had Skype crash.

1088
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:32,102
[SPEAKER_06]: That was weird.

1089
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:33,342
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it didn't crash my whole computer.

1090
01:19:33,382 --> 01:19:33,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God.

1091
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:38,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Skype just crashed sadly and I was in the middle of a call when it did so so I apologize to the caller.

1092
01:19:39,426 --> 01:19:45,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully they will be able to get through again but I am firing Skype back up so we can take more calls and we look like we're back up.

1093
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:46,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

1094
01:19:46,729 --> 01:19:47,770
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of crappy.

1095
01:19:49,936 --> 01:19:51,437
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype.

1096
01:19:51,977 --> 01:19:52,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio, guys.

1097
01:19:52,818 --> 01:19:56,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes Skype will crash on us as we're doing the show live.

1098
01:19:57,301 --> 01:20:01,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like what Bobby in chat is saying, talking about getting a 2DX cabinet.

1099
01:20:01,545 --> 01:20:04,727
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think if I were to drop the money, I'd have to get something Mamani-related.

1100
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:06,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I'd get a 2DX.

1101
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:08,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I think I'd want a Happy Sky.

1102
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:09,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1103
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:10,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we got another call.

1104
01:20:10,592 --> 01:20:11,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1105
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:11,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1106
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:13,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I can't believe I got through for this.

1107
01:20:13,858 --> 01:20:14,839
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first time calling.

1108
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:15,559
[SPEAKER_00]: This is X-Link.

1109
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:16,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hi, X-Link.

1110
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations on making it through.

1111
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:19,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1112
01:20:19,262 --> 01:20:22,985
[SPEAKER_06]: You lucked out because some other, unfortunately, we were on the line with another call and then Skype crashed.

1113
01:20:23,005 --> 01:20:25,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really feel bad, but that's just live radio sometimes.

1114
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And hey, you got through and you've never been on before.

1115
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,110
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's on your mind?

1116
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:34,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, I don't know exactly about the pinball games exactly.

1117
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:37,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcade, I'm sorry, arcade games.

1118
01:20:38,005 --> 01:20:42,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a little more about pinballs than I do arcade because I used to work on them working at arcade.

1119
01:20:42,687 --> 01:20:52,209
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the ones like Street Fighters and the use of those ones are a little more commonplace to find than you would with some of the other ones.

1120
01:20:53,169 --> 01:20:55,410
[SPEAKER_00]: The more newer they are, the easier to find, of course.

1121
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:59,231
[SPEAKER_00]: The more harder they're to find is the more older they are, so...

1122
01:20:59,994 --> 01:21:11,322
[SPEAKER_00]: You really would have to search, and I know he's overseas, so that would probably be even more hard than it is over here in the US, where it's a tad bit more commonplace, maybe than, say, over here in Sweden.

1123
01:21:12,403 --> 01:21:20,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It really depends on all of those factors, but I do agree, the best way to find an arcade game without having to pay all the shipping, look for an arcade near you that's closing down.

1124
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:22,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no joke.

1125
01:21:23,593 --> 01:21:48,176
[SPEAKER_00]: um but like I said before we closed down unfortunately my arcade we had like four and a half pages full of arcade different arcade games so I mean yeah if I want this nearly getting ready to close down you probably can pick one up for a good price well there you go hopefully uh the advice will be taken even though I think that last caller wasn't overseas they're upstate New York but I know we do have other listeners that are overseas that can take that um uh advice to heart well what else is on your mind

1126
01:21:49,755 --> 01:21:51,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Glee, great show, first off.

1127
01:21:52,198 --> 01:22:00,867
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was calling more in tone to THQ and their golden weed that they sent over to overseas there.

1128
01:22:02,156 --> 01:22:03,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Glee was amazing, by the way.

1129
01:22:03,798 --> 01:22:10,765
[SPEAKER_06]: If folks need a new TV show to watch, even though there's only the one episode, definitely reminded me of being a music geek in high school.

1130
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:18,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we made it a short show tonight when Loki wasn't able to be here, we were going to talk about the Golden Wii.

1131
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little bit about this and what you wanted to say about it.

1132
01:22:22,177 --> 01:22:37,135
[SPEAKER_00]: THQ which unfortunately lost a major amount of money over the last year which I thought that was even more ironic decided to send a golden Wii overseas to the UK to give to the Queen as a thank you

1133
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:39,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for what?

1134
01:22:39,941 --> 01:22:41,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Just being queenly?

1135
01:22:41,803 --> 01:22:45,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a way to promote their new game.

1136
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:46,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.

1137
01:22:46,848 --> 01:22:51,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, though, come on, I don't think the queen is really going to play this Wii.

1138
01:22:51,152 --> 01:23:00,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, she's obviously a little old, and I think every time I've seen her on TV and stuff, she seems to have limited mobility.

1139
01:23:00,602 --> 01:23:04,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some would argue with me whether that means she can't play the Wii or not, but, you know, come on.

1140
01:23:05,005 --> 01:23:06,926
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the freaking queen of England.

1141
01:23:06,966 --> 01:23:09,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she's got better things to do than sit there and play the Wii.

1142
01:23:09,587 --> 01:23:16,011
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I think it's one of those things that you'll see in a museum someday, is the Wii the queen once owned, even though she never touched it.

1143
01:23:17,452 --> 01:23:22,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, she has a, supposedly she was playing the Wii before with the prince.

1144
01:23:22,495 --> 01:23:24,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly there was articles about that.

1145
01:23:24,356 --> 01:23:27,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they sent her over one, so she could have one of her own.

1146
01:23:27,638 --> 01:23:28,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I stand corrected.

1147
01:23:28,618 --> 01:23:30,099
[SPEAKER_06]: What a great photo op that must have been.

1148
01:23:30,989 --> 01:23:31,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1149
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:34,525
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1150
01:24:01,963 --> 01:24:03,704
[SPEAKER_06]: and if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong again.

1151
01:24:03,764 --> 01:24:04,425
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is new?

1152
01:24:05,645 --> 01:24:07,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, that's pretty much about it I can think of.

1153
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:11,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to see what comes out of E3 in a couple weeks out of all these rumors and stuff.

1154
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:13,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see which ones are true and which ones are false.

1155
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:14,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

1156
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:21,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of curiosity, since OLR can't compete with the commercial sites, what do you want us to bring you from E3?

1157
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:29,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever news is not given, I guess, because a lot of it's going to be hard because a lot of the news soon is going to break.

1158
01:24:29,122 --> 01:24:32,703
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be posted all over the web and Twitter and Facebook and all that.

1159
01:24:33,923 --> 01:24:35,824
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be harder this year.

1160
01:24:36,004 --> 01:24:44,267
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no Kensha Hall for everyone to ignore or do the nice fluff piece that is the one article on the entirety of Kensha Hall.

1161
01:24:44,847 --> 01:24:52,750
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I understand, we're not having that this year, so it's going to be difficult to really dig around, but we will try to find the Kensha in E3 for you guys.

1162
01:24:53,624 --> 01:24:59,966
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like to see is maybe even what the independent people are doing.

1163
01:25:00,006 --> 01:25:07,209
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of these games that are below key that should have been the major hits that are maybe not as hits?

1164
01:25:08,245 --> 01:25:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I will do my best to dig up the independent stuff for you guys.

1165
01:25:10,566 --> 01:25:13,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's where we're going to have to find our niche this year.

1166
01:25:13,086 --> 01:25:18,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet there's a lot of people that want to be heard and they're going to be excited to have somebody care.

1167
01:25:18,928 --> 01:25:20,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly, you know what?

1168
01:25:20,728 --> 01:25:22,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's find the next Braid.

1169
01:25:22,568 --> 01:25:24,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's find the next Katamari Damacy.

1170
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:27,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's find that next big thing that hasn't been discovered yet.

1171
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:29,410
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that idea.

1172
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,010
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1173
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:33,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, X-Link, we've got to let you go so we can take some more calls.

1174
01:25:33,111 --> 01:25:34,451
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you so much, first-time caller.

1175
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:36,432
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

1176
01:25:36,492 --> 01:25:37,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Call us again sometime.

1177
01:25:37,918 --> 01:25:38,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely.

1178
01:25:38,459 --> 01:25:39,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, later, dude.

1179
01:25:39,579 --> 01:25:39,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1180
01:25:41,461 --> 01:25:42,422
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take some more calls.

1181
01:25:42,982 --> 01:25:45,685
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, some other comments from chatroom on what they want to see from E3.

1182
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:49,127
[SPEAKER_06]: RLBX327 wants to know about the iPhone games at E3.

1183
01:25:49,888 --> 01:25:52,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, King of Fighter 12 details.

1184
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:58,896
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I did get an email about a pre-tournament that's going on, but it's going on, like, I think the Sunday before E3, so sadly we'll still be here.

1185
01:25:58,976 --> 01:25:59,516
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't go.

1186
01:25:59,897 --> 01:26:01,678
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know there's going to be some tournaments going on.

1187
01:26:02,359 --> 01:26:05,962
[SPEAKER_06]: AlphaCatanagram wants some Katamari Forever footage and a soundtrack bootleg.

1188
01:26:05,982 --> 01:26:06,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1189
01:26:06,882 --> 01:26:09,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how Namco would feel about a bootleg on our site, but we'll try.

1190
01:26:11,285 --> 01:26:12,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1191
01:26:12,366 --> 01:26:12,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1192
01:26:15,788 --> 01:26:16,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1193
01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:17,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1194
01:26:20,327 --> 01:26:22,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

1195
01:26:22,248 --> 01:26:23,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the caller isn't there apparently.

1196
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:27,752
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1197
01:26:28,032 --> 01:26:33,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, you can always test the calls before giving us a call at echo123 is the username on Skype.

1198
01:26:33,595 --> 01:26:37,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a great way to make sure that your microphone is working and all that fun stuff before you actually call us.

1199
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:40,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that doesn't work with a touchtone phone.

1200
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Touchtone phones are much easier though.

1201
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,241
[SPEAKER_06]: You just pick up the phone and call.

1202
01:26:43,601 --> 01:26:46,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I've ever seen a phone not work, although I have seen them be quite...

1203
01:26:46,443 --> 01:26:48,585
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, I went to Anime Boston 2009 this weekend on Saturday

1204
01:27:13,818 --> 01:27:14,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, and how was that?

1205
01:27:14,819 --> 01:27:26,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to hear that there was some OLR meetups going on, because I know somewhere in the Bay Area right now, GS68 is crying because he's the only OLR guy at Faname, which I'm very sad I didn't get to this year, but next year, next year.

1206
01:27:26,389 --> 01:27:27,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how was Anime Boston?

1207
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:29,571
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

1208
01:27:31,053 --> 01:27:33,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it was my first convention.

1209
01:27:34,035 --> 01:27:35,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I really didn't know what to expect, but...

1210
01:27:37,072 --> 01:27:38,474
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty good.

1211
01:27:39,395 --> 01:27:45,381
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first things I did was find DJ Ranma S. He was selling some stuff.

1212
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:51,126
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't seem to have any good luck this weekend, but he said overall he had a good time, I guess.

1213
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:54,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess he'll be calling in maybe next week to talk about it.

1214
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:55,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's getting home late.

1215
01:27:56,251 --> 01:27:57,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure he will.

1216
01:27:57,212 --> 01:28:00,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Today's his birthday, too, if I'm not mistaken, so happy birthday to that if you're listening.

1217
01:28:00,296 --> 01:28:00,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

1218
01:28:00,896 --> 01:28:02,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody wish him a happy birthday.

1219
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:02,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I did.

1220
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:31,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, and this crosses over into video games too, because I'll tell you, you can't walk through one of these hallways without seeing some Kingdom Hearts inspired, you know, fan art or something.

1221
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see any art?

1222
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:34,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you looked around the art.

1223
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:37,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see some art that really jumped out of you that you thought was awesome?

1224
01:28:37,502 --> 01:28:38,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And what was it?

1225
01:28:38,892 --> 01:28:40,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a lot of stuff.

1226
01:28:40,213 --> 01:28:44,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw anything from like anime stuff from like Death Note.

1227
01:28:44,437 --> 01:28:48,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the typical stereotypical stupid Naruto stuff.

1228
01:28:48,221 --> 01:28:51,304
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my opinion, not fact, but that's not my thing.

1229
01:28:52,065 --> 01:28:53,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I also found video game stuff.

1230
01:28:54,547 --> 01:28:58,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Like basically, what did you say you were wondering if there was there?

1231
01:28:59,338 --> 01:28:59,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know.

1232
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:02,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's always something Kingdom Hearts, but did anything kind of jump out at you?

1233
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:04,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Kingdom Hearts, yes.

1234
01:29:04,162 --> 01:29:05,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me give you an example.

1235
01:29:05,703 --> 01:29:07,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me give you an example.

1236
01:29:07,285 --> 01:29:10,447
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was at ASEN, I actually bought this.

1237
01:29:10,487 --> 01:29:15,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was so rad because I bought it for my boyfriend, who I know is a big fan of this.

1238
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:21,757
[SPEAKER_06]: But they actually had an art dealer table, and she had a drawing of David Bowie from Labyrinth.

1239
01:29:21,877 --> 01:29:23,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just thought that was so awesome.

1240
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:26,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, how random to find something like that at an anime con.

1241
01:29:26,902 --> 01:29:29,425
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you see anything that jumped out at you like that?

1242
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:32,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, wow, I didn't expect to see that at an art dealer table.

1243
01:29:35,591 --> 01:29:40,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess pretty much everything was unexpected for me.

1244
01:29:40,293 --> 01:29:41,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, this was my first con.

1245
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:52,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw, I mean, they were selling a little... I also have a friend in chat called Robocon that doesn't seem to get to listen to OLR a lot, but he tries to catch the podcast.

1246
01:29:52,939 --> 01:29:53,860
[SPEAKER_05]: He's live in there now.

1247
01:29:55,501 --> 01:30:03,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We went together on Saturday and they had little buttons they were selling for $0.50 to $1.

1248
01:30:04,427 --> 01:30:12,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a little thing from The World Ends With You, that little pin that you'd get in that portable RPG game that says you're in the game thing.

1249
01:30:14,927 --> 01:30:16,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I know.

1250
01:30:16,388 --> 01:30:17,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's cool.

1251
01:30:17,289 --> 01:30:22,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, The World Ends With You definitely has its fans, especially the Squeenix fans.

1252
01:30:22,752 --> 01:30:23,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So okay, cool, cool.

1253
01:30:24,434 --> 01:30:24,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1254
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:32,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I also saw something interesting as a stained glass thing of various Death Note anime characters.

1255
01:30:32,679 --> 01:30:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the character, the Detective L, but it was like a vampire version of him with blue hair.

1256
01:30:38,483 --> 01:30:39,484
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty cool.

1257
01:30:40,543 --> 01:30:43,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they used the ballroom for the video game thing.

1258
01:31:14,003 --> 01:31:16,005
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of games did you see in the room when you went there?

1259
01:31:18,368 --> 01:31:21,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw they had a Street Fighter 4 tournament going on.

1260
01:31:21,652 --> 01:31:25,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally got to play poppin' music.

1261
01:31:25,496 --> 01:31:27,018
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a pretty cool experience.

1262
01:31:27,378 --> 01:31:28,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I love poppin' music.

1263
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:32,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1264
01:31:32,093 --> 01:31:33,193
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I brought that up.

1265
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:39,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And the interesting thing is they did have the Rock Band 2 set up on the Xbox 360.

1266
01:31:39,776 --> 01:31:47,939
[SPEAKER_05]: The interesting thing I saw was the Nintendo Wii that they had actually was running on the Homebrew channel.

1267
01:31:47,999 --> 01:31:49,960
[SPEAKER_05]: The Homebrew channel which allows you to run like...

1268
01:31:51,132 --> 01:31:53,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Selfmade Applications, among other things.

1269
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:58,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were using it for perfectly legitimate reasons, so I thought it was kind of cool.

1270
01:31:59,057 --> 01:32:06,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I've got one more question for you before we let you go, and it actually comes from our chat room from our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, heard before us here Sunday nights on All Games Radio.

1271
01:32:06,641 --> 01:32:11,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby asks, Anime Boston is in the same place as PAX Boston is going to be.

1272
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,605
[SPEAKER_06]: How is the size of the place?

1273
01:32:13,705 --> 01:32:17,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some people are speculating it may not be big enough for an event the size of PAX.

1274
01:32:19,797 --> 01:32:37,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think, I think that it's, well, I think there's like three floors, um, three, I think it's like a three floor place, and, uh, we were all around it, and, uh, it's pretty big, it really is, it's bigger than I thought it was gonna be.

1275
01:32:38,112 --> 01:32:47,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, there's a mall that's like attached to it, like, and we got some food there afterwards, but it's pretty big, I mean, even without that, the convention center itself, I mean...

1276
01:32:49,228 --> 01:33:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: so yeah I think it could handle PAX East because I mean the attendance just keeps climbing every year on Anime Boston as it is so yeah it could probably handle that that's interesting news because I was I saw that the I was expecting it to be Memorial Day weekend the next week and it wasn't so I saw that it was like April 2nd or 4th from Anime Boston so probably somebody else like took the Memorial Day weekend it happens it happens there's a lot of big conventions Memorial Day weekend

1277
01:33:17,863 --> 01:33:22,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for the report, and glad to hear you enjoyed your first con.

1278
01:33:24,129 --> 01:33:24,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot, Rob.

1279
01:33:26,031 --> 01:33:29,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll see you at PAX Boston, speaking of which, since it sounds like it's in the neck of the woods.

1280
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:30,794
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see what I can do.

1281
01:33:32,775 --> 01:33:35,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to work things out, but we'll meet someday.

1282
01:33:36,378 --> 01:33:38,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll see you later.

1283
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:39,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1284
01:33:40,621 --> 01:33:42,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get you next time, Gadget.

1285
01:33:44,103 --> 01:33:44,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1286
01:33:44,423 --> 01:33:46,985
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do one more call if it comes in pretty soon here on the phones.

1287
01:33:47,005 --> 01:33:48,106
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?

1288
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:49,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

1289
01:33:49,266 --> 01:33:50,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually checking for video game sims.

1290
01:33:51,088 --> 01:33:51,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah?

1291
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:56,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I found one of Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 4, so that's a pretty good one.

1292
01:33:56,432 --> 01:33:56,872
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fun.

1293
01:33:57,332 --> 01:33:59,174
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I still have yet to play Resident Evil 5.

1294
01:33:59,214 --> 01:34:00,034
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell's wrong with me?

1295
01:34:00,515 --> 01:34:02,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But outside of the demo.

1296
01:34:04,337 --> 01:34:07,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, our phones sadly are not really ringing right now, so we're going to go ahead and close up the lines.

1297
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, call!

1298
01:34:08,621 --> 01:34:09,161
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's too late.

1299
01:34:09,181 --> 01:34:09,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I closed up the lines.

1300
01:34:10,302 --> 01:34:11,843
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at about an hour and a half now anyway, and

1301
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:17,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to go run out and get some food and enjoy the rest of my Memorial Day weekend as I'm sure a lot of you folks do.

1302
01:34:17,596 --> 01:34:21,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to go ahead and go around and start to wrap things up and get on out of here for the evening.

1303
01:34:21,819 --> 01:34:22,559
[SPEAKER_02]: In ribbons and bows?

1304
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:23,760
[SPEAKER_06]: If we want to.

1305
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,021
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

1306
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:29,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll start with me tonight, although I don't have much of a final thought tonight.

1307
01:34:29,483 --> 01:34:31,844
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is yogurt.

1308
01:34:32,445 --> 01:34:33,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I want yogurt.

1309
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:34,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I want some too.

1310
01:34:34,466 --> 01:34:35,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be amazing right now.

1311
01:34:35,867 --> 01:34:36,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be some yogurt.

1312
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:37,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be fantastical.

1313
01:34:38,351 --> 01:34:40,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Not FroGurt, but Yogurt.

1314
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the FroGurt has potassium benzoate.

1315
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:44,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

1316
01:34:45,767 --> 01:34:47,150
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

1317
01:34:49,334 --> 01:34:49,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn.

1318
01:34:50,848 --> 01:34:51,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1319
01:35:12,812 --> 01:35:16,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about the program.

1320
01:35:16,614 --> 01:35:18,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Help spread the good word about the show.

1321
01:35:18,275 --> 01:35:23,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Help offset those a-holes that leave negative reviews on websites because they have nothing better to do with their sorry ass lives.

1322
01:35:23,898 --> 01:35:29,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it really helps us have the motivation to keep going when you guys say good things about us.

1323
01:35:30,062 --> 01:35:32,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And just knowing we have certain people that would be here every week.

1324
01:35:33,123 --> 01:35:34,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like when you send me money.

1325
01:35:35,464 --> 01:35:46,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Although sometimes it can be frustrating when people bitch and moan and bellyache when you go a week without a show or that the podcast was late or whatever, it does show that people care enough to complain.

1326
01:35:46,931 --> 01:35:51,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually kind of see the good in that and thanks everybody for your passion around the show.

1327
01:35:51,654 --> 01:35:53,875
[SPEAKER_06]: That is very motivating, surprisingly enough.

1328
01:35:54,135 --> 01:35:56,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep us on our toes, I guess is what I'm saying.

1329
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Twinkle toes.

1330
01:35:57,277 --> 01:35:57,697
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1331
01:35:58,158 --> 01:35:58,838
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's it.

1332
01:35:59,258 --> 01:35:59,779
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of here.

1333
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:02,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great night, everybody, and tune in next week.

1334
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,522
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1335
01:36:04,562 --> 01:36:05,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great night.

1336
01:36:06,132 --> 01:36:08,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1337
01:36:09,414 --> 01:36:12,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1338
01:36:13,095 --> 01:36:21,719

1339
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:33,825

1340
01:36:34,405 --> 01:36:35,226
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next week!
