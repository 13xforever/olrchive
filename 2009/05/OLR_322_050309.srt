1
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:19,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, May 3rd, 2009, will we see multiple motion controllers at this year's E3?

2
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:22,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the Ninja Turtles being remade for a new downloadable game?

3
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:25,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And a new video game will let you show off your ironing skills.

4
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:36,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:41,842
[SPEAKER_10]: We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:43,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm with you here every week.

7
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:45,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob Roberts also joining you tonight.

8
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:48,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

10
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Always here with us as usual.

11
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:52,028
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?

12
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:53,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm recovering.

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Recovering?

14
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:55,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you an alcoholic?

15
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:56,452
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

16
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:57,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to hear it.

17
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,733
[SPEAKER_10]: From the week from hell.

18
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:00,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to hear about the week from hell.

19
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is there a lot of gaming to be done in the week from hell?

20
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:05,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Some, actually, a little.

21
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:09,938
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we'll get to that in just a moment, but we can't start the show without introducing the one and only Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:10,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

23
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:11,098
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you doing?

24
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:11,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

25
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And I see your normal Sunday ration of fast food.

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,241
[SPEAKER_10]: You have some Burger King tonight.

27
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:17,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

28
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:18,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Sticking with the traditionals.

29
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:25,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to get McDonald's, but I somehow was in a daze and drove past it.

30
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:31,745
[SPEAKER_09]: How exactly do you select what your fast grub is going to be before the show, before you get here?

31
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Just what I feel like.

32
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:33,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Just what you feel like?

33
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:34,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

34
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:35,827
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you going to stop at on the way?

35
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:43,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I was driving home from Oakland right before the show, so I wouldn't have been able to stop somewhere healthy because it takes a lot longer.

36
00:01:45,349 --> 00:02:02,215
[SPEAKER_09]: and unfortunately fast food didn't take quite as, it wasn't as fast as I had hoped because an idiot in front of me decided to use a coupon for their fast food order and the coupon didn't apply to what they had ordered so he sat there arguing with them for a good 10 minutes and that sucked.

37
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:09,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Misty in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com starts us off tonight wanting to know but the question is what kind of BK noms?

38
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Double Bacon Cheeseburger Very healthy Exactly, it's very delicious

39
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:24,911
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, and Black Wolf, the gentleman before us here Sunday nights when we tape live on All Games Radio at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

40
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Wolf is in chat and says, hey, I heard this was a show about video games.

41
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:31,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Once in a while, once in a while we do talk about video games.

42
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:32,256
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, let's get to it.

43
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:35,438
[SPEAKER_10]: We always like to start off a little bit of how is your gaming week?

44
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:39,220
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no guests tonight, just you guys in the chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

45
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,102
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll start off tonight with Dark Sakura.

46
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:41,902
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week?

47
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:46,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Cooking Mama on iPhone while waiting for Wolverine to start.

48
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,748
[SPEAKER_07]: The rest of it was spent on homework.

49
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,972
[SPEAKER_07]: All week, homework.

50
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:53,973
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

51
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:07,506
[SPEAKER_10]: It cuts into your cooking moment time.

52
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:10,407
[SPEAKER_07]: It's annoying, but it is smart marketing.

53
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:13,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So I try not to think of it one way or another.

54
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:17,409
[SPEAKER_07]: The bottom line is all that matters to the companies.

55
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,210
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, they're going to try to get the word out there in every front possible that's just marketing.

56
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,251
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really, I guess, indifferent towards the whole thing.

57
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:35,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I may not care about what does that show with What's-Her-Face, Kira Sedgwick, but the only good thing I saw her in was singles anyway.

58
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:39,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked the first 15 minutes of it.

59
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,156
[SPEAKER_07]: That part was great.

60
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:41,837
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all about Wade not shutting up.

61
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:05,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Without spoiling anything.

62
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the listeners should know you're a total Deadpool fan girl.

63
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:09,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a total Deadpool fan.

64
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:12,754
[SPEAKER_10]: So this was very important, the treatment that he received in the movie.

65
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:15,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm sure you love the end.

66
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:17,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Depending on which ending.

67
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:22,078
[SPEAKER_09]: The actual end and not the end after the end.

68
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,880
[SPEAKER_07]: The bonus end, okay, if you watch after the credits, there's one of two endings.

69
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got the more lame one.

70
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:33,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to see the other one on YouTube before it got pulled off.

71
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wish I'd had that one because it made me a lot happier and had some fourth wall breakage.

72
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to give spoilers, though.

73
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying anything.

74
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:44,473
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just doing that so they can whore that character out for another whore movie.

75
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,155
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more warning Loki than you.

76
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:53,080
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I've been reading several interviews and articles where they're leaving it open for a Deadpool movie.

77
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Which would make me happy if they do it freaking right.

78
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:04,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Question from chat, and a comment from chat, I like old people in chat, which by the way, I still love that name, says, X-Men applies to games because there is a game of it.

79
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there's been several games about the X-Men.

80
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:13,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember an old school one on the PC, like back in the early 90s, where you were trying to rescue Storm.

81
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:15,946
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even remember what the game, I think it was just X-Men, or whatever.

82
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,547
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, X-Men and games have always been kind of tied together a little bit.

83
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,447
[SPEAKER_10]: There's always those tie-ins.

84
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:23,488
[SPEAKER_10]: But DJRamaS asks, how well did Ryan Reynolds play Deadpool?

85
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:24,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Deadpool, Wade,

86
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:39,548
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Men X-Men X-Men X-Men

87
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:03,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pure and utter ass.

88
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,544
[SPEAKER_06]: They had nothing to do with each other, you know what I'm talking about.

89
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:22,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

90
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:24,865
[SPEAKER_10]: They tipped the hat, is what I'm saying.

91
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:32,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Gambit, I mean, hello, I was a little worried about how they were going to portray Gambit, but he showed up and was like, hi, I'm Gambit, I'm going to be awesome now.

92
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:41,158
[SPEAKER_07]: What I was actually most pleased with about him is that his accent is legitimate.

93
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,101
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not one of those overdone fake Cajun accents.

94
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:48,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds pretty right for the area, so I was pretty pleased with that.

95
00:06:49,132 --> 00:07:12,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft is in our chatroom and says I couldn't see the movie since theaters are closed in Mexico because he lives in Mexico and you know how swine flu is all the rage down there as it is starting to be up here too they're closing all the movie theaters Rei Ayanami said sine flu and I'm certainly thinking cosine flu next alright, let's get into more video games Loki, did you play anything this week?

96
00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:16,916
[SPEAKER_09]: yes I did, I played some DS stuff

97
00:07:18,243 --> 00:07:19,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero plus zero equals zero Exactly

98
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:46,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Rick!

99
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:47,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Rick!

100
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:00,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Actual games.

101
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:03,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I played more of the Great Giana Sisters DS game.

102
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:05,226
[SPEAKER_09]: How is that?

103
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to check that out.

104
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:07,967
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a basic DS game.

105
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,309
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, very much a ripoff of Super Mario Bros.

106
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:18,391
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's what made the old school one on the Commodore 64 so awesome, was that it was such a ripoff of Mario Bros.

107
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:19,692
[SPEAKER_10]: How's the music?

108
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:22,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I love the soundtrack to the Giana Sisters.

109
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:23,573
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

110
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:30,096
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not, I mean, I didn't notice any old remakes or whatever, but maybe there were, I mean...

111
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I never really played the original.

112
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:41,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was funny though, I like how she gets the red orb or whatever and becomes Emojiana or whatever and just starts throwing fire that way.

113
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:45,025
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, oh look, I went to Hot Topic, now I'm gonna kick ass.

114
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:47,766
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was okay.

115
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:54,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Played a little bit more Rhythm Heaven, but I still can't stand that game because it's not forgiving at all.

116
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just, I'm trying to get gold on stuff and it's just not...

117
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:00,492
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

118
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like a copy of a copy, and it's also confusing.

119
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:27,007
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't really tell you what you're supposed to be doing a lot of times.

120
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:31,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, it's not like, you know, where it's like chop, and you kind of get what you're supposed to do.

121
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,056
[SPEAKER_09]: This I couldn't figure it out, so it was annoying.

122
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And they played a lot more Grand Theft Auto.

123
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:44,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to make a flamethrower, and I kind of got one sort of made out of a sniper rifle and some fire effect thing.

124
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,275
[SPEAKER_09]: And it works pretty good, except sometimes you can catch yourself on fire, which is kind of annoying.

125
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:04,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now that's no fun.

126
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:12,824
[SPEAKER_09]: When another one, like a hurricane bomb or something, where you throw it down and it just throws everything around, but it can kill yourself also pretty violently sometimes.

127
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:15,406
[SPEAKER_09]: So, just kind of messing with that.

128
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:16,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And then...

129
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:18,705
[SPEAKER_09]: What else?

130
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:31,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I tried playing Bionic Commando, but the problem is, at our work, our internet's like, even though we're on a T1, it's like split 200 ways, and it's slow as hell, and I couldn't connect to any games.

131
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:35,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was very disappointing, and fortunately this weekend, being so busy, I didn't get a chance to actually play that.

132
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,659
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to play that, because that game looks awesome.

133
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:42,559
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's pretty much it for this week.

134
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:55,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I may have played a little bit more Excitebots somewhere in there, because I finally unlocked Super Excite, so I'm actually even playing through that tonight, which apparently is very unforgiving, even more so than the first game.

135
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:59,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and Excitebots is here in studio tonight.

136
00:10:59,782 --> 00:11:00,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, on Justin.tv.

137
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:02,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So the wife finally let it go for you.

138
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:03,783
[SPEAKER_09]: She gave up on it, actually.

139
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:04,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh, really?

140
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she said it was too hard.

141
00:11:06,923 --> 00:11:11,987
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, if you've never listened to the show before, something you should know about Loki's wife, she really doesn't play a lot of games.

142
00:11:12,267 --> 00:11:15,590
[SPEAKER_10]: But there'll be that occasional game she gets obsessed with, and Excitebots is one of them.

143
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Excitebot, or Excite Truck was really the one that, yeah, and then, you know, Excitebot she was really looking forward to.

144
00:11:21,635 --> 00:11:28,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And she still, you know, had fun with it, but it's just, she's gotten to, you know, kind of a wall right now where she can't, you know, S-rank these super Excitebots.

145
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got, I mean, it's really hard.

146
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you have to get even more points than you did in the first time.

147
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:36,587
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first time, you know, in just normal Excite race,

148
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:41,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, getting S sometimes requires you to play a track like 20 times, if not more than that.

149
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you have to get even more than what you got before.

150
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:47,776
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, you want to pull your hair out.

151
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,098
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you get mirror mode, which is even harder.

152
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's always fun.

153
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,341
[SPEAKER_09]: But you unlock more bots.

154
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the hand.

155
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there's a hand that tries to smack you for some reason.

156
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:02,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Smash Brothers hand.

157
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:05,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's Master Hand, but it's a hand that tries to smash you.

158
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

159
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:08,228
[SPEAKER_09]: for no apparent reason whatsoever.

160
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I do kind of want to check this game out.

161
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:17,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope... No, we don't have any guests to play it on JustinTV tonight, but hopefully we'll have an in-between stories, kind of be able to play some.

162
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:17,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

163
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I also played a 101-in-1 retro game.

164
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget what it was called.

165
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:26,271
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that Atlus collection of little mini-games.

166
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:35,513
[SPEAKER_09]: That sucked too, because apparently you start off with like 10 games, and you have to play through all of them, and they don't control very well, and...

167
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:43,268
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to score so many points before you can unlock another game, and I can't, because it doesn't control very well, and it's annoying.

168
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:43,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Dope.

169
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:44,688
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

170
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:46,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

171
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:46,989
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

172
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well, let's see, Mikey.

173
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:54,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, oh, but I did want to mention something else we played, which I don't remember exactly the title of the game.

174
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:59,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was something like, um, was it, uh, Eat Poop Cat or something like that?

175
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:06,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, the one, uh, Eat... Yeah, I remember, yeah, it had a very weird name.

176
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:08,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Eat Something Cat Poop or something like that was the name of the game.

177
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:09,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

178
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:11,207
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

179
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:42,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you pass it again, the next person writes the caption they think goes with the picture, then they fold over the picture, and the next person draws a picture to go with the caption, and so on and so on.

180
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:45,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it sounds stupid as I'm describing it, but it's actually a lot of fun.

181
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:49,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's always someone in the group who will turn everything into penis.

182
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,066
[SPEAKER_10]: No matter, you know, what you do.

183
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:53,806
[SPEAKER_10]: That person was Rice Princess.

184
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:54,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

185
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:56,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Truth.

186
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:57,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow.

187
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:58,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

188
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:00,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Other games.

189
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:00,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

190
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:01,685
[SPEAKER_10]: My gaming week.

191
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.

192
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:05,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I still had the old standby old stuff.

193
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:12,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially a lot of classic gaming on the Nintendo Wii this week going into my archive of like Zelda and Kid Icarus and all the old school stuff.

194
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:15,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a lot of new stuff for me this week.

195
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:18,958
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's been a lot of new stuff that's been out recently that's kind of caught my attention.

196
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:25,803
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am excited though about some of the Xbox Live arcade releases coming up at least this coming week that I'm hoping to try out before

197
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Animae Central

198
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:32,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

199
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:35,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to talk about and give a little reminder.

200
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:38,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I am going to be at Anime Central this weekend in Chicago.

201
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a panel on Friday.

202
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,300
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called So You Think You Can Podcast.

203
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:57,525
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you ever want to hear more about how OLR got started or kind of the story behind it, or you want to start your own podcast and kind of curious where do I begin, what kind of mics do I need, how do I get a listener base or what have you, I'm going to be doing that panel 4.30 on Friday.

204
00:14:57,565 --> 00:15:00,926
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe it's panel room 7, but I'm doing that off the top of my head.

205
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Please check the program for the specific location.

206
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:08,191
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's one of the smaller rooms because they're not anticipating there's going to be a big crowd for that.

207
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:10,832
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's prove them wrong and make it standing room only.

208
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:16,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I want to give another thank you to the listeners for the wonderful show computer.

209
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:23,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, we're not broadcasting off that tonight, but I think when we come back in two weeks, we're going to be on that show computer, the new one, right?

210
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:26,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we're having a chance to actually put it together.

211
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:27,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it just hasn't worked out.

212
00:15:27,263 --> 00:15:30,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, since of ASEN next week, I do not believe there's going to be a show next week.

213
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:33,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So next week we will be off.

214
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:37,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, I don't get back from Chicago until... Actually, it's funny.

215
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I get back at like 7 o'clock.

216
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:41,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to miss.

217
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's hoping there's no delays or anything like that.

218
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, we will not be here next week.

219
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:48,432
[SPEAKER_10]: But Bobby, of course, will be here as always.

220
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:50,132
[SPEAKER_10]: So give his show a listen.

221
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:52,333
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll probably run a little long next week to compensate.

222
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Bobby was saying that he played Paul's Big Adventure on WiiWare.

223
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:58,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I've been meaning to actually...

224
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:01,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Play or install.

225
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:02,877
[SPEAKER_09]: But I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.

226
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:04,518
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's a pretty awesome game.

227
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:07,599
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one that kind of rips off of all these different old school games.

228
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,661
[SPEAKER_09]: They have like the Castle from Mario Brothers and stuff in it and like weird stuff.

229
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:13,451
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

230
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,900
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

231
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:16,071
[SPEAKER_10]: for a personal thing I do I've been using YouTube a lot more recently for like a non-gaming thing so I've learned how to like edit video a lot better and do that stuff so I'm excited to go to ASEN and actually shoot some video so I hope our listeners aren't camera shy because I will be in your face with a camera and if so too bad yes too bad alright

232
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:17,998
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm excited.

233
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's really it for housekeeping tonight.

234
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into some video game news.

235
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,723
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of rumors tonight.

236
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:26,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Rumors, rumors, rumors.

237
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:28,744
[SPEAKER_10]: But aren't rumors fun to talk about?

238
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:32,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to see if they seem real or not to us.

239
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:33,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Loki's going to start us off tonight.

240
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:36,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, one rumor that we have came from Engadget.

241
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:40,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, they have somebody that has captured what they...

242
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:45,074
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

243
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:01,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

244
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:34,535
[SPEAKER_09]: They were saying that you can use it in a trivia game over the internet with live images of each person playing and the buzzing you would clap.

245
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:42,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other stuff, including sensor detects when the person is playing.

246
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:45,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Only the person that's playing the game and not the people that are just watching it.

247
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:52,867
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do believe they showed this off the company behind it during CES this year.

248
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:55,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looked interesting.

249
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:55,990
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically...

250
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:58,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

251
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:03,240
[SPEAKER_09]: They were using actually just a normal webcam and they had a boxing game.

252
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,762
[SPEAKER_09]: They were showing some guy doing that.

253
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:08,785
[SPEAKER_09]: It almost looked like an eye toy boxing game because you could see the guy in the background and stuff.

254
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:11,187
[SPEAKER_09]: They have like a flight sim game and stuff.

255
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:18,092
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically the same kind of applications you would use like an eye toy for this would be used for.

256
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,373
[SPEAKER_06]: But the eye toy sucked.

257
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but technology is getting better.

258
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:25,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like the PlayStation Eye is a lot better than the original eye toy.

259
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:25,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, first off.

260
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:27,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Real or bullshit?

261
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:28,285
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think?

262
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:29,425
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an image of it.

263
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:32,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it's real and this is something that they've already... Oh, come on.

264
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,927
[SPEAKER_09]: We live in a day and age of Photoshop.

265
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:42,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but they've already teased that, oh, we're going to show something off at E3 that's going to revolutionize the way you play games or the way you enjoy entertainment.

266
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:43,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, hello?

267
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:46,722
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, real or bullshit?

268
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:47,322
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not good for real.

269
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:04,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though.

270
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though it's real, it's not that new.

271
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,330
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have a camera on the Xbox 360.

272
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:18,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I hear about this, I shudder because I think of Totem Ball, which was that horrible, horrible video camera game they had that they tried to do the full-body motion controls with.

273
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:18,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

274
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, granted, technology's gotten a little better, but come on.

275
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,500
[SPEAKER_10]: That game was shit.

276
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:23,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

277
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:23,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with you.

278
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:26,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And this technology, they actually bought a company.

279
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft bought a company.

280
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:39,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hear that guy, I forget his name, I want to say Bobby Lee, but I don't think it's Bobby Lee.

281
00:20:39,515 --> 00:20:40,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Something Lee.

282
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:45,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the guy that did all those wonderful Wiimote things with the stereoscopic or the...

283
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:48,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Head Tracking, and that kind of stuff.

284
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:49,499
[SPEAKER_07]: The one who did all those experiments.

285
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, the demos and stuff.

286
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he works for Microsoft now.

287
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:56,606
[SPEAKER_09]: That is such a Microsoft thing to happen to.

288
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:56,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

289
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:57,767
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so funny.

290
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:00,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would not be surprised if this is at E3.

291
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,132
[SPEAKER_09]: This makes sense.

292
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:06,276
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to get into a little bit more later on with other things.

293
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:09,600
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you think about it, these companies now are starting to take away what...

294
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:11,576
[SPEAKER_09]: is unique about the Wii.

295
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:17,261
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you take away the motion sensing from the Wii, what's left?

296
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:18,201
[SPEAKER_09]: A GameCube.

297
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:19,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo franchises.

298
00:21:19,823 --> 00:21:23,606
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, if at first you don't succeed, buy a company that does it better.

299
00:21:23,986 --> 00:21:26,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLinger.com if you want to join us in our chat room.

300
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the other thing about it.

301
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Video conferencing, not new.

302
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:33,474
[SPEAKER_10]: We already have that on the Xbox 360 with a camera.

303
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:35,616
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that nobody bought the camera.

304
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Except people who wanted to play Strip Uno.

305
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:40,860
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only reason people bought the camera.

306
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that game, You're in the Movies?

307
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:43,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Drop down to $20.

308
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:45,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I forgot about that game.

309
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's $20 with the camera bundled in.

310
00:21:48,285 --> 00:21:49,626
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually cheaper than buying the camera by itself.

311
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think it's because they're unloading the cameras because they're not going to need them anymore?

312
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:52,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

313
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:53,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know...

314
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:59,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming it's going to be more than just a single camera, because obviously that didn't work before.

315
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:01,293
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have new technology now.

316
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:03,874
[SPEAKER_09]: We've even seen it before, like in past E3s.

317
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:18,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I can remember way back to E3 2005, they were showing off camera technology that was actually putting bounding boxes around people's heads and was able to track individual people and was able to differentiate who's playing the game and who's not.

318
00:22:19,662 --> 00:22:23,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wouldn't be surprised if we see this.

319
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:28,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Deathwishing says, I bought the camera for Rainbow Six Vegas.

320
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know, there were a lot of little games that would use the camera.

321
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:37,455
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like Uno had it in some of the other online Xbox Live games.

322
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:43,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some of the other games, like Burnout Paradise, you could take your driver's license picture with the camera.

323
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:44,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, ah.

324
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:46,158
[SPEAKER_09]: A little dumb shit like that.

325
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:47,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, every time you, you know...

326
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:49,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

327
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:20,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I also want to say some other comments from chat here.

328
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,201
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf, of all people, actually says, You're in the movies doesn't work too well, sadly.

329
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:26,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't get the right lighting.

330
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:30,043
[SPEAKER_10]: That's always a pain in the ass with these camera setups, too, is the lighting.

331
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:33,485
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not just right, the game works terribly.

332
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I had a couple of those iToy games on PlayStation 2, and they work like crap.

333
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:38,728
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

334
00:23:38,788 --> 00:23:40,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you have to have the exact right lighting.

335
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:45,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm hoping that this stuff that comes out for wherever this camera peripheral is going to be...

336
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:52,082
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hopefully going to be a little bit better than the current camera out there.

337
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a sucker.

338
00:23:53,543 --> 00:24:01,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I've bought all three cameras, both the PlayStation Eye toy and the Vision camera and the PlayStation Eye.

339
00:24:01,948 --> 00:24:03,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, I haven't really used the PlayStation Eye.

340
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:10,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I meant to use it when I was going to make all these little big planet levels, which I never did.

341
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:16,337
[SPEAKER_09]: The Vision camera was... I don't even remember what the hell I bought the Vision camera for.

342
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:18,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to have it, I think.

343
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:26,885
[SPEAKER_09]: And, man, I can tell you at least with... I haven't tried the PlayStation 9 too much, but the other two, disappointment.

344
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:31,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Except we did get a good webcam out of the iToy Play.

345
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in the day.

346
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So that kind of worked out.

347
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:39,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember when iToy Chat was going to be the next big thing on the PlayStation 2?

348
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:40,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever happened to that?

349
00:24:40,956 --> 00:24:41,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know.

350
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:43,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

351
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:46,810
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, the PlayStation Eye though, they're definitely doing a lot of things with it.

352
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like they have that, you know, Eye, was it a pet thing that's coming out?

353
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:56,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, the other concept games that they've made, you know, where they can capture images and stuff that people draw.

354
00:24:58,276 --> 00:24:59,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they would actually... I have crap.

355
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they would actually implement, you know, that.

356
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:05,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this wasn't the Eye of Judgment stuff because scanning cards is retarded.

357
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,780
[SPEAKER_09]: That's been around forever.

358
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,341
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, hell, there's the e-reader on the Game Boy Advance.

359
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about actually...

360
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:17,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Something unique where you can actually draw the tanks and stuff like that.

361
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:18,095
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.

362
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:22,516
[SPEAKER_09]: But they never released it because it was just a little demo that they made.

363
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:25,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well guess what?

364
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:29,237
[SPEAKER_10]: This rumor about motion controllers does not stop with Microsoft and the Xbox.

365
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:33,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony apparently is working on something as well, which shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, right?

366
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:39,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo has been leading in sales and the big thing that separates their system from their competitors right now is the motion controls.

367
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,920
[SPEAKER_10]: So of course...

368
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft and Sony want to find ways to get a piece of the pie.

369
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So we hear this out of Microsoft's camp and out of Sony's camp.

370
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:51,448
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a rumor, according to this blog called The Cutscene, which is related to Variety.

371
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,229
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not just some Joe Schmoe's blog.

372
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:57,253
[SPEAKER_10]: This is related to Variety, which is a huge magazine in the entertainment industry.

373
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:02,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Some sources leaked to The Cutscene blog that Sony is going to be unveiling a new device at E3.

374
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:06,680
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not quite the same thing, though, that Loki's been describing for Microsoft.

375
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a camera.

376
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:10,343
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that's going to have pointing in it.

377
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:11,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently.

378
00:26:11,184 --> 00:26:17,529
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically... They don't know yet if it's going to be the regular controller infused with a pointer, which is a possibility.

379
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,673
[SPEAKER_10]: But this thing that I'm looking at, according to these patents, almost look like... I don't know.

380
00:26:22,693 --> 00:26:25,655
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like somebody's playing Samba de Amigo with these maraca-type things.

381
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:28,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, they're not actually maracas, but the little pointers look like little devices.

382
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:33,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, though, is really they're targets that are being used with the PlayStation Eye.

383
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:35,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you think?

384
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:36,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

385
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:36,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not...

386
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:43,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's basically like the reverse of the Wii setup.

387
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:44,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of actually having the

388
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:51,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Sensor bar just being a couple lights and then having the receiver being in the actual remote.

389
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:57,877
[SPEAKER_09]: This is actually using the camera as the receiver and then the points or whatever of reference are actually on the controller.

390
00:26:57,997 --> 00:27:05,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, continuing on the patent here, they actually say, yeah, this small camera will track the movement of multiple LED lights on the controller.

391
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:14,001
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you use your PlayStation Eye and maybe they're going to put lights in these controllers or something so that you can actually move them around, they call it a Wiimote in reverse.

392
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:16,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, because it wouldn't be that hard for them.

393
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:21,247
[SPEAKER_09]: They've already got 6-axis, which does all the tilting and that kind of stuff.

394
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:26,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they really need depth of field and kind of the IR pointing stuff that the Wii has.

395
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:26,771
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

396
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,471
[SPEAKER_10]: They've said it.

397
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let me read you this one final quote about this.

398
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:35,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote, Because the camera can read different color lights and the shape and angle of each light, it's much more accurate than the Wiimote.

399
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:43,204
[SPEAKER_10]: It can track precise movements, including along the Z-axis, pushing towards and away from the TV, something the Wii is really bad at, as well as velocity.

400
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:45,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Truth or bullshit?

401
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:48,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Truth, but I'm not sure if they're announcing ID.3.

402
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:10,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

403
00:28:27,225 --> 00:28:28,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to say distorted truth.

404
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's necessarily – I'm along the lines of what you're saying.

405
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:37,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that they're going to launch this whole new controller, this motion controller that you're going to have all this extra crap for your TV.

406
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:44,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're going to find ways to use the devices they already have, maybe releasing a new six-axis controller with the lights in it that's going to involve this.

407
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:46,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would say distorted truth.

408
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:50,347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those where there's smoke, there's fire type of things.

409
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:50,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't know.

410
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Every Sony rumor has been true.

411
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:18,574
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's just go with true on this.

412
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:21,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Because seriously, every time they're like, no, that's not really happening.

413
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:22,516
[SPEAKER_09]: We have no plans for that.

414
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:23,276
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you talking about?

415
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:24,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's like, oh, hey, look.

416
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:25,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, look.

417
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:27,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Price drop on PlayStation 2.

418
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:29,578
[SPEAKER_10]: That totally surprised you.

419
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:34,340
[SPEAKER_10]: But wait, how many times have there been rumors that the PlayStation 3 price is going to drop or be redesigned?

420
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,120
[SPEAKER_10]: That never happens.

421
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's rumors.

422
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:38,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's wishful thinking.

423
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:44,624
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of those rumors are coming from people thinking, okay, Microsoft's dropping their price or this is coming out.

424
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:47,308
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to drop it in order to be competitive.

425
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they don't care.

426
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:52,223
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no price drop.

427
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Just consider the source.

428
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:54,564
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's going to happen.

429
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:55,184
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

430
00:29:55,725 --> 00:30:05,011
[SPEAKER_10]: So knowing that Microsoft and Sony, one way or another, we all pretty much agree, except DarkSakura's not sure, but we all pretty much agree they are making movements to go towards motion control.

431
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,692
[SPEAKER_10]: We at least all agree that Microsoft's going to do it.

432
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:07,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me put it this way.

433
00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:10,915
[SPEAKER_09]: If one of them does it, it's either Sony or Microsoft.

434
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,156
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one's pretty much going to have to do it.

435
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:13,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course Microsoft's going to do it.

436
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:17,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft has made their machine out of ripping off good ideas and doing it well.

437
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,180
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a slam on Microsoft.

438
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,142
[SPEAKER_10]: They do a great job of ripping off good ideas.

439
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,042
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

440
00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:23,284
[SPEAKER_10]: And making them better.

441
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:26,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, here's what I want to ask.

442
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:27,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Should Nintendo be worried?

443
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:28,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

444
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:33,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Because really, everyone's looking at innovative motion controls.

445
00:30:33,772 --> 00:30:37,195
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they pride themselves on, these games.

446
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,577
[SPEAKER_09]: And granted, they have franchises and stuff.

447
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:45,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong, Mario Kart's awesome, Mario Galaxy's cool, Zelda's really nice, but...

448
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:46,877
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

449
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:16,310
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people just pick up Tiger Woods' game on the Wii, even if they own both, because they want that extra immersion for it.

450
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:24,356
[SPEAKER_09]: But now you can take those awesome, like Red Steel or something like that, or Matterworld, that looks awesome, but is kind of limited by the hardware.

451
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:27,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you've got more power for the hardware and the motion controls.

452
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,439
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be some really awesome games.

453
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:31,541
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, Nintendo...

454
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:39,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't see them doing anything very innovative at E3, and I bet you anything all their announcements are not going to be innovative and they're just going to be sequels to their franchises.

455
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:44,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Much like a Pikmin 3, or, you know, like a sequel to Wii Fit.

456
00:31:45,178 --> 00:31:50,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, I mean, they have a sequel to basically the Wii Moat coming out, you know, with Wii Motion Plus, the fix, something they should have had in the first place.

457
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,461
[SPEAKER_09]: And a sequel to Wii Sports, because that's what sells on their system.

458
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:57,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And funny enough, that's why I disagree with you.

459
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Nintendo has nothing to worry about.

460
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:04,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, when I first heard this earlier in the week, I had the same reaction you did.

461
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:05,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, oh, Nintendo's fucked.

462
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're going to have this new thing with the motion control.

463
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,952
[SPEAKER_10]: They're taking what makes the Nintendo Wii so great.

464
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,574
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting it on this new hardware.

465
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:16,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo's screwed because everybody's going to want to go to the better looking games.

466
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:16,918
[SPEAKER_10]: But I thought about it.

467
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:17,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought about it.

468
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought, you know what?

469
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,300
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not really going to happen.

470
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:39,125
[SPEAKER_10]: at the end of the day Nintendo is still going to have kids and soccer moms and that's who they've built their audience on that's how they built their system that's who's still going to be loyal to them remember people are not buying the Wii for the Wii they're buying the Wii for Wii Sports and at the end of the day Nintendo still has Wii Sports will this put a crack in it?

471
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:46,707
[SPEAKER_10]: yes some of the fanboys and the hardcore a little crack might be put in Nintendo because of this but is it enough to shatter Nintendo?

472
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,367
[SPEAKER_10]: absolutely not

473
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:51,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're already too far ahead, but I think it will slow them down.

474
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:55,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Because now they can't say that they have all this innovative control stuff.

475
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:58,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Now they actually have to think on their feet and come up with something new.

476
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's really, I think, what they should be doing is coming up with something new.

477
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:08,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Because now they've caught up to, you know, you can only be really innovative so long.

478
00:33:08,712 --> 00:33:10,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Now people have caught up to what you had.

479
00:33:10,412 --> 00:33:12,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like, you know, with Rumble and stuff.

480
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:14,433
[SPEAKER_09]: People started implementing Rumble, now everybody has it.

481
00:33:15,014 --> 00:33:16,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you've got to come up with the next big thing.

482
00:33:17,174 --> 00:33:19,176
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the thing.

483
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:23,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, keep in mind, the motion is built into the Wii.

484
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:26,961
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a part of every Wii game because it is what makes the Wii.

485
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:30,444
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, besides maybe a couple games here and there that decide to ignore it, but you know what I mean.

486
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:33,766
[SPEAKER_10]: It is integrated into the Wii.

487
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:34,607
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion control is the Wii.

488
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:36,868
[SPEAKER_10]: With the Xbox 360, this is something extra.

489
00:33:37,228 --> 00:33:40,631
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not something that was not already in the system by default.

490
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:41,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Power Glove, U-Force, Power Pad, and...

491
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Video cameras, which we were just talking about, the vision cameras.

492
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I think they would have done a lot better if they were bundled in with games.

493
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at what Nintendo's doing now.

494
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:13,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Fit.

495
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:17,689
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to sell a lot of balance boards, so what they did, they included the software free.

496
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:23,054
[SPEAKER_09]: They wanted to sell a lot of remotes and stuff like that, so they included a game for $10 more.

497
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:28,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to say before somebody in chat screams their head off, some peripherals do break the mold and do well.

498
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar...

499
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,323
[SPEAKER_10]: and Drum and DDR have all shattered.

500
00:34:33,343 --> 00:34:33,963
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wii Wheel.

501
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:38,347
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be surprised how freaking popular it is for a piece of plastic.

502
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:43,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't... But for the Wii Wheel, we had a Lynx crossbow.

503
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:44,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the problem, though.

504
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:52,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and I understand, you know, Lynx crossbow training, well, with the Wii Zapper, that sucked, and yeah, the Wii Zapper is a horrible peripheral.

505
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:53,199
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is...

506
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the problem Microsoft has.

507
00:34:55,764 --> 00:35:03,358
[SPEAKER_09]: All the people that wanted the Wii for Wii Sports and that kind of stuff, they're going to buy the Wii because it's cheap or cheaper.

508
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:13,298
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, with Microsoft and stuff, actually, if they can come out with some sort of way to bundle in a sports game in this motion sensor, they might be able to pull it off.

509
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:15,861
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're going to have to have a must-have game with this.

510
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if they try to pack in Totem Ball, don't fucking bother.

511
00:35:19,444 --> 00:35:23,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, don't fucking bother Microsoft if you're going to put in a game of that quality.

512
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,730
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to have to put in a must-have game.

513
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,674
[SPEAKER_10]: And they've got to be careful if they're going to try to be competitive with the Wii Sports thing.

514
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:32,435
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

515
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:32,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

516
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:36,257
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to need to have the must-have game with this in order to sell this thing.

517
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:42,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's how Guitar Hero and all those peripherals did well, is because they came with must-have games.

518
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:45,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Link's Crossbow Training, not so much a must-have game.

519
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:50,405
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR, pop culture icon of the late 90s, early 2000s, you know what I mean?

520
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:53,947
[SPEAKER_10]: The DDR pads did fairly well because of that.

521
00:35:55,467 --> 00:36:06,319
[SPEAKER_09]: and also it depends Microsoft's going after Core Gamer they're trying to get into more of the casual game market Nintendo not so much anymore with the Core Gamer they just want to bring on new people that haven't played games

522
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they're going to overshadow Halo ODST right now.

523
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:10,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's more of an announcement for next year.

524
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And

525
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:37,646
[SPEAKER_09]: They need something more than Halo because Halo is not going to bring in the casual gamer.

526
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:42,988
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be fair, GameGuru said the same thing and said that's the game you need to put the X-Mode in.

527
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:49,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, you know, I just think it would be if Halo 4 supports it, it'll help drive it.

528
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:54,213
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just don't think, you know, I think they're going to turn off a lot of their Halo because there's some people that don't want this.

529
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:56,055
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

530
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to run and fill about and kill people.

531
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the fitness bandwagon is where it's at.

532
00:37:37,813 --> 00:37:38,934
[SPEAKER_07]: EA Playground did it first.

533
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:39,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, whatever.

534
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:05,749
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

535
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:35,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the people that leaked the Forza 3 rumor have also sent in an image showing that there's going to be Perfect Dark on Xbox Live Arcade.

536
00:38:36,861 --> 00:38:41,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it could possibly be it has the same thumbnail image that Rare leaked in April.

537
00:38:45,805 --> 00:38:48,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I was just watching what Loki was doing with the controller.

538
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:51,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's playing on Excitebots right now, so it's a little bit distracting.

539
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:52,588
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks a little perverse.

540
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,849
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like you're driving the Batmobile or something.

541
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:57,530
[SPEAKER_10]: This is an interesting car.

542
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it is an actual bat he's driving.

543
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,192
[SPEAKER_10]: This game looks kind of fun, actually.

544
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:15,278
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was saying, the thought overall is that there could be more rare Nintendo 64 titles coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but there's not really enough to support it yet.

545
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:17,296
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to wait and see.

546
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:19,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

547
00:39:19,977 --> 00:39:26,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there's a lot of Perfect Dark fanboys, and certainly I did not like that new one they had on Xbox 360, like their launch title at all.

548
00:39:27,438 --> 00:39:29,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, going back to the classics, I think it'll be a lot better.

549
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:31,059
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's also funny.

550
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:40,380
[SPEAKER_09]: They also had Bean listed on there, which I don't remember if that's a... It was a codename for either the original Perfect Dark Zero or if it's the sequel to Perfect Dark Zero.

551
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,681
[SPEAKER_09]: That was also listed on there, which is kind of funny.

552
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:43,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, Ash...

553
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:45,701
[SPEAKER_09]: 4 is the 3

554
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:04,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

555
00:40:32,622 --> 00:40:35,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Forza, not a racing series I particularly get into.

556
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,185
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little heavy for me, but I guess there's a lot of fans of Forza, certainly.

557
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:42,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know there will be a lot of folks that are all about this at E3 this year.

558
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:47,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have other big, big rumors, and this one has to do with portable gaming.

559
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:54,852
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, it involves the PSP, and apparently the rumor has leaked out about the new PSP that's going to be shown at E3 this year.

560
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:56,373
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called the PSP Gauntlet.

561
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:56,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Go!

562
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:03,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently the rumors are starting to snowball with this due to some one-up reporting from earlier this week.

563
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:08,599
[SPEAKER_10]: According to some inside sources, apparently it's going to be getting a complete hardware redesign.

564
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:14,401
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks to me like a cell phone with one of those screens that pops out like a sidekick.

565
00:41:15,021 --> 00:41:24,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's supposed to be like that, but the way this thing looks is it looks like a sidekick to me where the screen kind of pops out and then you have the controller underneath it.

566
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,508
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the silliest thing I've ever seen in my life.

567
00:41:54,449 --> 00:42:18,011
[SPEAKER_10]: it's going to be meaning no discs so meaning that the game will be entirely fueled and this is where the rumor has been going for a while now that there's going to be this PSP 2 that's fueled this way that this PSP Go is going to be fueled entirely off downloadable titles in fact over 100 classic and new PSP titles they are saying available at the systems launch one of the biggies Gran Turismo Mobile

568
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:30,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope for their sake they're not doing this move in hopes that it's going to cut down on their piracy because I'll have them know all the PlayStation Network titles that they have available there are only for download only.

569
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:33,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Those have already leaked out, and they leak out just as fast.

570
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:44,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So they better hopefully fix whatever ways people have of exploiting their system and putting custom firmwares on because if they don't, this is going to be completely useless.

571
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:46,035
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.

572
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:11,383
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

573
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:39,621
[SPEAKER_10]: What's interesting about this, you're not talking about a hardware upgrade with this, which is what I find really interesting about this.

574
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:41,163
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a PSP2.

575
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:43,685
[SPEAKER_10]: That's where I'm kind of like, huh?

576
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:48,089
[SPEAKER_10]: At what Sony's doing here, because they're not taking this opportunity to upgrade the hardware at all.

577
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't really see the point of needing to hide the controls in there.

578
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:58,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, really, is there any reason why you need a sliding screen unless the screen is going to be touchscreen or something like that?

579
00:43:58,193 --> 00:43:58,874
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a look thing.

580
00:43:59,194 --> 00:44:04,536
[SPEAKER_10]: If I put a little protector on the screen, I can carry it around in my pocket and not have to worry about breaking the buttons.

581
00:44:05,237 --> 00:44:06,097
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like a cell phone.

582
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,298
[SPEAKER_10]: You concealed the keyboard underneath the screen.

583
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, we'll have to see.

584
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:30,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure if they're going to announce it, they're going to announce it at E3.

585
00:44:31,193 --> 00:44:35,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I kind of find it funny that they've already revised their system like three times already.

586
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:37,397
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just trying to find the perfect fit.

587
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:39,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's read some comments from chat.

588
00:44:39,772 --> 00:44:41,813
[SPEAKER_10]: This is stirring a huge response in chat right now.

589
00:44:41,873 --> 00:44:43,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to comment.

590
00:44:44,074 --> 00:44:49,676
[SPEAKER_10]: GoldAnthro in chat says, No UMD is fucking retarded and the downloadable titles will probably be DRM to hell.

591
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:52,797
[SPEAKER_10]: DeathWishing says, I like owning cases.

592
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:53,358
[SPEAKER_10]: That sucks.

593
00:44:53,798 --> 00:44:55,658
[SPEAKER_10]: HungryMister says, Oh shit, this is amazing.

594
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:58,360
[SPEAKER_10]: TheRobD says, Yeah, that's interesting stuff.

595
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,380
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a good idea.

596
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if storage can support it though.

597
00:45:01,821 --> 00:45:06,763
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of true too is that when you're talking about how many games are going to fit on 8GB.

598
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:07,483
[SPEAKER_09]: The largest

599
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:09,788
[SPEAKER_09]: This UMD game is 2 gigs.

600
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:13,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So that you're talking like maybe... But most of them are not 2 gigs.

601
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so maybe 7 games.

602
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,141
[SPEAKER_10]: So there better be an easy-ass way for me to move games on and off this thing.

603
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Like an iTunes-ish thing to manage my system.

604
00:45:24,942 --> 00:45:32,143
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem, though, is if you don't have high-speed internet, even still if you have high-speed internet, downloading a 2-gig game is going to take a long time.

605
00:45:32,203 --> 00:45:37,304
[SPEAKER_10]: And all these caps now, too, with Comcast and all this says 250 gigabytes and so on.

606
00:45:37,344 --> 00:45:38,364
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be dangerous, right?

607
00:45:38,644 --> 00:45:39,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

608
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:48,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

609
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:52,722
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's all digital, it's just going to make it a little bit cheaper for them.

610
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:54,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get some other comments from chat real quick.

611
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:58,046
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw says, I prefer owning a physical copy of the game rather than a digital version.

612
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:01,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Brad from PodCulture says, Not a fan of the no UMD deal though.

613
00:46:02,189 --> 00:46:03,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it looks kind of neat too.

614
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Make the Switch and do something like Nintendo.

615
00:46:05,912 --> 00:46:06,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Put the game on a chip.

616
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:09,635
[SPEAKER_10]: A slot wouldn't take up near the space that UMD would.

617
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:20,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the same time, this is not going to really sell to people that, say, for example, own a bunch of PSP games already, because now they've got to replace them all or buy them again.

618
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, do you think people are going to buy their games again?

619
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's wishful thinking, Sony, if that's what you think is going to actually happen.

620
00:46:26,876 --> 00:46:35,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's another thing, is that if I already own this game on UMD, there better damn well better be a way that I can transfer this onto my PSP without having to rebuy the game.

621
00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:36,743
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be...

622
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:38,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Shitty, if not.

623
00:46:38,787 --> 00:46:41,474
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a bad feeling that's where we're going.

624
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:42,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Because how else is it going to know?

625
00:46:42,978 --> 00:46:45,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no other way unless, I mean...

626
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:48,047
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

627
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:21,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Download Game System Download Game System Download Game System

628
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:27,571
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

629
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:58,833
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm sure if they had a way to do standalone games they'd probably be selling games for it as well but that's the only means to get stuff on there and the fact that they're going to try to compete with that

630
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:02,493
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of dumb with taking the UMD out of the picture.

631
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:08,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Hitstun in chat says, Sky, apparently you can go to a store and they'll have a kiosk that will transfer your UMD game to a memory stick.

632
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:09,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope to hell that's true.

633
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:15,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if it's not, and I'm going to be forced to rebuy the game I already own on the PSP1, I will turn to piracy.

634
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:16,785
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing.

635
00:48:18,086 --> 00:48:20,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to openly admit that on the show, but that's...

636
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:21,609
[SPEAKER_10]: That's dumb.

637
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:24,871
[SPEAKER_09]: That's even more retarded if they're going to do that.

638
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:28,394
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to stop Joe Blow from loaning his game to somebody?

639
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:36,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I could buy one copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and loan it to 50 people and they can all get it dumped to their... Unless they use a key.

640
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:39,463
[SPEAKER_09]: But not for old games.

641
00:48:39,543 --> 00:48:40,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Old games don't have that.

642
00:48:40,404 --> 00:48:42,105
[SPEAKER_09]: And each game isn't marked.

643
00:48:42,265 --> 00:48:43,547
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't tell one from another.

644
00:48:43,607 --> 00:48:44,147
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what though?

645
00:48:44,347 --> 00:48:50,633
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Joe Blow taking this latest CD that he bought at the store and his friend ripping it to his iTunes?

646
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:53,616
[SPEAKER_10]: You know that happens rampantly as it is.

647
00:48:54,016 --> 00:48:57,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but they're trying to figure out ways not to do stuff like that.

648
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:02,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, granted, we can assume that someone's doing that, but they're making it super easy.

649
00:49:02,684 --> 00:49:03,625
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, you know...

650
00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:09,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, I can have you buy a game and then now we all have the game because you bought the game.

651
00:49:09,673 --> 00:49:13,037
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I like that idea.

652
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my question to you.

653
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:18,842
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was that easy and it was that open, would you steal the game?

654
00:49:20,632 --> 00:49:20,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

655
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:28,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's nothing easier than not driving to the store and not, you know.

656
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:29,697
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mean, seriously.

657
00:49:29,897 --> 00:49:34,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand you sometimes because you pay extravagant amounts of money for some games and other games you're just like, yeah, I'll just download it.

658
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:37,584
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

659
00:50:00,526 --> 00:50:02,087
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

660
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:32,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I blame Nintendo for not having demos for their... Well, they do have demos for their games, and I guess I could have tried it out online.

661
00:50:33,352 --> 00:50:33,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Big deal.

662
00:50:33,733 --> 00:50:36,555
[SPEAKER_09]: That still takes too long on the Wii, and really, I don't want to do that.

663
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:38,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

664
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:08,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I just wanted to present both sides of it for the people that get, you know, little angry clouds over their heads when you talk about piracy and all this stuff.

665
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be fair and present both sides.

666
00:51:11,712 --> 00:51:15,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And, to be honest, the last game I played on my PSP, I don't even remember when.

667
00:51:15,516 --> 00:51:16,537
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so long ago.

668
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:18,099
[SPEAKER_09]: PSP.

669
00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:19,700
[SPEAKER_09]: The last thing I played on my PSP?

670
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:23,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Rift Tracks for Twilight, and that was awesome.

671
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:26,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's going to do it for our PSP discussion.

672
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:35,000
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to call in about this later, I'm sure we'll get some calls about this a little later on the show, but we want to move on to some release dates and some non-rumors, things we know that are coming out very soon.

673
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:36,342
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll start off in the UK.

674
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:38,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, UK, nothing until the 12th.

675
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:39,447
[SPEAKER_10]: What a bummer.

676
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:41,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Must be a slow release week.

677
00:51:42,554 --> 00:51:43,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a non-release week.

678
00:51:43,115 --> 00:51:47,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that everyone's recovering from May 1st being a fertility holiday.

679
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:48,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't there a bank holiday?

680
00:51:50,058 --> 00:51:50,478
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be.

681
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:50,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

682
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:53,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was on the 7th or something.

683
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well then so much for UK releases.

684
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:56,442
[SPEAKER_09]: How about the US?

685
00:51:58,043 --> 00:51:59,884
[SPEAKER_09]: In the US, there's actually some stuff coming out.

686
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:05,668
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, actually, it's very ironic that we were just talking about all these digital downloads.

687
00:52:06,288 --> 00:52:13,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Patapon 2, the digital download only, or you can get the little card to redeem it, is actually going to be available on PSP this week.

688
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:16,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Also this week, we're going to be getting...

689
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:40,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, part of the new Play Control re-release series on the Wii Fantasy Aquarium World, looks like shit, so don't buy it, it's on the Wii, really cheap though Puzzle Kingdoms, game from Zoo Games, actually created by the creators of Puzzle Quest and it's basically a rip-off of Puzzle Quest, but you can get that on the DS this week

690
00:52:41,478 --> 00:52:49,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Night at the Museum, Battle for the Smithsonian, that's going to be on Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this week.

691
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:55,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Jagged Alliance coming to the DS, which, man, that's an old game that they're porting over there.

692
00:52:56,523 --> 00:53:02,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Crysis, the Maximum Edition, I believe that's with Crysis Wars, the original Crysis, and the online multiplayer one.

693
00:53:03,445 --> 00:53:04,566
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be available for PC.

694
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:31,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Destiny of Zorro coming out this week on the Wii Leisure Suit Larry boxed off his bus finally coming out on the PS3 if I need to remind you guys that got horrible reviews and apparently really sucked so keep that in mind and then probably the best one this week Klonoa coming out on the Wii which is pretty awesome price now $30 $30 you can't beat that um

695
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:39,376
[SPEAKER_09]: and then of course, you know, to go along with that, you have to have a really crappy game.

696
00:53:39,736 --> 00:53:40,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine Music Fest.

697
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:43,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Imagine if I cared.

698
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:46,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3

699
00:54:07,295 --> 00:54:15,118
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're into the Chinese rock and stuff, you might want to check this out because I do not believe there's ever been a DDR with Chinese music.

700
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:19,159
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they've had Korean, they've had Japanese, of course, and American, naturally.

701
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's been one before with Chinese.

702
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,920
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be the first one, to my knowledge.

703
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,881
[SPEAKER_10]: On the PlayStation 3, nothing this week.

704
00:54:26,921 --> 00:54:28,181
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very slow week in Japan.

705
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:29,642
[SPEAKER_10]: It's looking very similar to Europe.

706
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:32,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Even on the Nintendo Wii, not a thing as well.

707
00:54:32,923 --> 00:54:36,304
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a release coming up until May 14th when you have a winning XI game coming out

708
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:52,163
[SPEAKER_10]: on the PlayStation 2 nothing this week either same thing on the DS it is a very slow week in Japan right now so not a darn thing being released except that DDR in other Asian regions so there you have it we'll have more to talk about next week hopefully so let's get back into some gaming news

709
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:58,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is a little news regarding a particular bit of rock and roll royalty.

710
00:54:58,823 --> 00:55:03,828
[SPEAKER_07]: As in Prince, who is now, again, Prince and not that weird symbol.

711
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,712
[SPEAKER_07]: That was actually incredibly brilliant on his part.

712
00:55:08,694 --> 00:55:09,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't go into it.

713
00:55:09,575 --> 00:55:10,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Look it up on Wikipedia.

714
00:55:11,236 --> 00:55:14,100
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, he does some serious drugs or something.

715
00:55:14,704 --> 00:55:16,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Prince Turn Down a Deal to Have His Songs in Guitar Hero

716
00:55:36,306 --> 00:55:46,435
[SPEAKER_07]: He has said that he doesn't have a problem with them, but he thinks it's more important that kids learn to actually play the guitar.

717
00:55:46,795 --> 00:55:51,859
[SPEAKER_07]: To put the effort into it and not have it just basically handed to you.

718
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:55,522
[SPEAKER_07]: He was quoted as saying, to play music is one of the greatest things.

719
00:55:56,471 --> 00:56:03,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with that, but at the same time, I think Guitar Hero and Rock Band gets people playing the fake guitars and gets them interested.

720
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:04,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

721
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,474
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, stop being arrogant.

722
00:56:06,874 --> 00:56:09,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I understand.

723
00:56:09,415 --> 00:56:13,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I know plenty of people who play those games who have zero interest in learning the guitar for real.

724
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,237
[SPEAKER_07]: They want the instant gratification.

725
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:18,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but it's better than no appreciation for music whatsoever, right?

726
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:20,096
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

727
00:56:20,156 --> 00:56:21,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same thing with Wii Music.

728
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:28,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember we had the same discussion when Wii Music came out about how, hey, as dumb as this game looks, if it gets kids interested in music, it's a good thing.

729
00:56:28,576 --> 00:56:40,763
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different for younger kids, which I think Wii Music would more appeal to, than usually the people who are buying Guitar Hero and Rock Band already have an interest in the music they'll be playing.

730
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:50,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, one benefit with all the download content is being introduced to new bands and hearing new things, but at the same time...

731
00:56:55,066 --> 00:57:01,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't think that it's a great introductory medium now for people learning about music.

732
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:03,935
[SPEAKER_07]: We Music, I think, is a completely different animal.

733
00:57:05,376 --> 00:57:12,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it's a darn shame that he feels this way because When Doves Cry would be the most epic rock band song, in my opinion.

734
00:57:12,684 --> 00:57:12,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

735
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:14,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be fun.

736
00:57:14,742 --> 00:57:15,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I would buy that in a heartbeat.

737
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:16,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what would be better than that?

738
00:57:16,884 --> 00:57:17,084
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

739
00:57:17,704 --> 00:57:18,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's Get Crazy.

740
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:18,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Or 1999.

741
00:57:18,945 --> 00:57:19,686
[SPEAKER_10]: That's more synth.

742
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:21,087
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun too.

743
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:28,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you know, since we're never going to get the keyboards, you know, they do synthy songs in rock band once in a while.

744
00:57:29,635 --> 00:57:30,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it's a darn shame.

745
00:57:30,716 --> 00:57:32,137
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some pretty kick-ass Prince songs.

746
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:37,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish they would just go above his head and go to Warner Brothers, which owns the old music, and just get it.

747
00:57:37,681 --> 00:57:45,427
[SPEAKER_07]: No, honestly, honestly, I would rather them get it from, get the permission of the artist, because that's more respect to the artist himself.

748
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:49,890
[SPEAKER_07]: If he doesn't want his music in the game, he has every right to turn it down.

749
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:54,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And if that's his reason... And I have every right to call him a cockknocker because of it.

750
00:57:56,204 --> 00:58:02,267
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's his reason and it's his music, like, I would be the same way with my art if it was something that I didn't agree with.

751
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:17,454
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had done something... Now, if it was something that I was doing just, you know, like, corporate something or the other, and that's the purpose I was being paid for, yeah, but if someone saw something that I did and say, wow, I think this would work good in my ad for anti-puppies.

752
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:20,776
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like puppies, so I say, no, you can't, you do that.

753
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:22,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Or for, you know...

754
00:58:23,677 --> 00:58:25,499
[SPEAKER_10]: You made an ad against puppies?

755
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:27,600
[SPEAKER_10]: What exactly is an anti-puppy?

756
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:30,182
[SPEAKER_07]: A cat?

757
00:58:30,202 --> 00:58:32,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Well played.

758
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:34,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Cats rule and dogs drool.

759
00:58:34,725 --> 00:58:35,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Love, Jamie.

760
00:58:35,786 --> 00:58:44,612
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was for something that I didn't really support on my own, then I would say no, and it would be my right because it's my work.

761
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:45,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with him.

762
00:58:45,713 --> 00:58:46,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It's his work.

763
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:50,656
[SPEAKER_07]: He has the right not to support it with his work.

764
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:53,157
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have the right to think he's kind of a douche because of it.

765
00:58:53,237 --> 00:58:54,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's just fun.

766
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:55,578
[SPEAKER_07]: We just want to have fun.

767
00:58:55,598 --> 00:59:04,021
[SPEAKER_07]: You can think that all you want to, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still... You're right, it's not going to change the end result, but... It's still his right to say no.

768
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:13,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Luckily, though, for you guys, that Guitar Hero was put together so lazily that there are a lot of programs out there allowing you to create your own custom mixes.

769
00:59:14,065 --> 00:59:15,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to go to that kind of trouble.

770
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:16,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

771
00:59:17,147 --> 00:59:20,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying that if you want to put the effort in, you could

772
00:59:21,744 --> 00:59:23,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your own Prince Guitar Hero.

773
00:59:23,886 --> 00:59:25,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I'm too lazy and that's what it really boils down to.

774
00:59:25,987 --> 00:59:27,208
[SPEAKER_09]: So what can you do?

775
00:59:27,348 --> 00:59:32,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would really want to own a Prince Guitar Hero?

776
00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:33,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not.

777
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:36,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless it's like weird shaped guitar.

778
00:59:36,195 --> 00:59:37,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I would if you get purple velvet suits with it.

779
00:59:40,418 --> 00:59:43,941
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you get guitars shaped like that symbol, I actually might have to do it.

780
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:55,571
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of cool See, even Loki can't resist It's just because it's so ridiculous I would like to see one that would actually have clips of Purple Rain in it

781
00:59:56,414 --> 01:00:04,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the thing is, though, I want to see if they have, you know, available the, was it the Guitar Wolf microphones?

782
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:07,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the ones that shot fire out of them when you sang into them?

783
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:09,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's cool shit right there.

784
01:00:09,382 --> 01:00:11,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, is that like Dance Dance Immolation?

785
01:00:12,464 --> 01:00:12,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

786
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:16,286
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a Burning Man, the version of DDR that when you screw up it shoots fire at you.

787
01:00:16,306 --> 01:00:21,710
[SPEAKER_09]: But all I know is Guitar Wolf is awesome and the movie Wild Zero is retarded and, you know,

788
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:23,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

789
01:00:44,149 --> 01:00:44,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.

790
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:49,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully it comes with a vacuum too then.

791
01:00:49,352 --> 01:01:00,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Glitter is one of those things, like if you throw glitter in your house ever, or you let somebody that has too much glitter on their body sit on your furniture, you will be finding that glitter like a year and a half afterwards.

792
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:03,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, why is there glitter on my sofa?

793
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Glitter sucks.

794
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:10,284
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, Rock Band's actually getting quite a bit of content.

795
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:17,350
[SPEAKER_09]: including a Franz Ferdinand 3 pack, which will include Do You Want To?, Lucid Dreams, and Take Me Out.

796
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:19,092
[SPEAKER_09]: All those available for $2.

797
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:25,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Separately are 160 Microsoft Points, or if you want to save 50 cents, you can buy the pack for 440 Microsoft Points, or...

798
01:01:27,657 --> 01:01:28,177
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

799
01:01:48,268 --> 01:01:50,630
[SPEAKER_09]: or Luscious Jackson.

800
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:51,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that song.

801
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:52,652
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the ones I'm going to buy.

802
01:01:54,574 --> 01:01:58,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Idealistic Types by Prong and The Banishment by Prong.

803
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:01,000
[SPEAKER_09]: That's coming out this week.

804
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,724
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not to play fanboy or anything here.

805
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:05,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm

806
01:02:06,105 --> 01:02:21,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Really pro-rock band, but it's sad when you see, and we're going to probably get into Guitar Hero's lineup for next month or for this month, it's sad to see that what's coming out one week for rock band is about the same as coming out the entire month for Guitar Hero.

807
01:02:23,675 --> 01:02:25,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I still don't own Guitar Hero World Tour.

808
01:02:25,316 --> 01:02:25,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see the point.

809
01:02:26,737 --> 01:02:32,041
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, all the songs I want to play are in Rock Band, and I don't mean to sound fanboy either, but too bad.

810
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:41,008
[SPEAKER_10]: When I look at the list of songs in Guitar Hero and put it next to the list of the songs, including download content in Rock Band, Rock Band wins for me, and I don't see the need to own both.

811
01:02:41,148 --> 01:02:41,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't...

812
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:46,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the ironic thing, though, the guitar I own is a Guitar Hero guitar.

813
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:49,276
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're a Guitar Hero fanboy, just STFU, sit down.

814
01:02:49,716 --> 01:02:51,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I still own the Guitar Hero guitars.

815
01:02:51,578 --> 01:02:53,840
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, I don't really care for the game.

816
01:02:54,621 --> 01:03:00,286
[SPEAKER_09]: And the best part about Rock Band, though, is there's a lot of songs available on their Rock Band store.

817
01:03:00,726 --> 01:03:03,989
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, they have finally hit the milestone of 666 songs.

818
01:03:04,009 --> 01:03:04,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

819
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:16,401
[SPEAKER_10]: 666.

820
01:03:11,236 --> 01:03:16,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there a 666 song like Skinnered or Marilyn Manson, or what did they do?

821
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there a celebration for the 666 song?

822
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:24,511
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there wasn't, but I didn't see what exactly was the 666 song.

823
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:26,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I guess it was...

824
01:03:31,898 --> 01:03:37,722
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't really say, but as part of whatever Jane's Addiction's Nothing Shocking, one of those hit 666.

825
01:03:38,062 --> 01:03:40,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Jane's Addiction works.

826
01:03:40,523 --> 01:03:41,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I can see that.

827
01:03:41,844 --> 01:03:50,109
[SPEAKER_10]: At least it wasn't... But it would have been funnier if it was one of those... You know how they've done the SpongeBob SquarePants stuff and they had some of the Nickelodeon show or whatever?

828
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:55,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It would have been funny if they had had Hannah Montana or something as the 666 song that came out.

829
01:03:55,192 --> 01:03:56,453
[SPEAKER_10]: That would have been pretty funny.

830
01:03:57,213 --> 01:03:58,754
[SPEAKER_10]: We Rock, Drum King, Rolling Stone

831
01:04:20,082 --> 01:04:21,082
[SPEAKER_10]: and Drum King.

832
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:26,144
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not because it has a deal with the actual band, the Rolling Stones.

833
01:04:26,524 --> 01:04:28,564
[SPEAKER_10]: It's based off the Music Magazine.

834
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:29,324
[SPEAKER_10]: You know Rolling Stone?

835
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:30,305
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a huge magazine.

836
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,485
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like an oversized magazine.

837
01:04:31,765 --> 01:04:33,965
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been around for many, many, many years talking about music.

838
01:04:34,485 --> 01:04:37,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, kind of interesting that it's going to tie in there.

839
01:04:37,986 --> 01:04:40,787
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just going to have to have two Wii remotes for air drumming.

840
01:04:41,147 --> 01:04:42,288
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all you use in the game.

841
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:44,970
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's being developed by ARC System Works.

842
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:52,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the songs that you can see in the game, We Will Rock You by Queen, Final Countdown by Europe, Song 2 by Blur.

843
01:04:53,075 --> 01:04:54,036
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, DarkSakura.

844
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:54,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're a Blur fan.

845
01:04:55,577 --> 01:04:56,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Feel Good Inc.

846
01:04:56,317 --> 01:04:57,058
[SPEAKER_10]: by The Gorillas.

847
01:04:57,318 --> 01:04:59,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, there's lots of... That makes me happy.

848
01:04:59,139 --> 01:05:01,341
[SPEAKER_10]: There's lots of Damon love in this particular game.

849
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:04,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And such 90s classics as All Star by Smash Mouth.

850
01:05:05,244 --> 01:05:05,804
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

851
01:05:06,304 --> 01:05:09,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Just some of the songs you can play in the Rolling Stone Drum King.

852
01:05:10,547 --> 01:05:12,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a name change from We Rock Drum King.

853
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,028
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess it means lots of free ads in the magazine.

854
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:15,348
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

855
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:16,948
[SPEAKER_10]: All righty.

856
01:05:17,368 --> 01:05:20,969
[SPEAKER_10]: A little more news for you guys before we take a break here on Orange Line Radio.

857
01:05:22,929 --> 01:05:27,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is a particular game that lots of people play just to make stuff in.

858
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I am one of them.

859
01:05:30,711 --> 01:05:31,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually The Sims.

860
01:05:32,071 --> 01:05:33,471
[SPEAKER_07]: There's stuff on Sims 3 out now.

861
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:35,912
[SPEAKER_07]: There actually is going to be...

862
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:48,560
[SPEAKER_07]: You get six pounds worth of sim points to spend at a Sims 3 store.

863
01:05:49,081 --> 01:05:53,644
[SPEAKER_07]: You can buy clothes and furniture and all kinds of other stuff.

864
01:05:54,145 --> 01:05:57,587
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get extra points in bundles of 500, 1,000, and 2,000.

865
01:05:58,608 --> 01:06:03,972
[SPEAKER_07]: You also get a game launcher, which is meant to be a hub for the Sims community.

866
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:07,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can get information and downloads and uploads and stuff online.

867
01:06:07,535 --> 01:06:08,016
[SPEAKER_07]: 5th of June, 5th of May

868
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:27,696
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

869
01:06:45,748 --> 01:07:13,011
[SPEAKER_07]: you gotta come sometime sorry, 5th June which will have a full community and product site and a new town which you can download and some stuff but it's coming out for PC, Mac, iPhone and iPod Touch and I actually might have to play it on my phone so it can go you people suck I just will be happy as long as there's textures and stuff

870
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:16,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want different ways to kill my Sims.

871
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:18,370
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really all I want.

872
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:19,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I want more haunted houses.

873
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:23,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make Silent Hill in Simverse.

874
01:07:24,642 --> 01:07:27,083
[SPEAKER_10]: I always liked making the elaborate death traps in The Sims.

875
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:28,964
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be fun to do in Sims 3.

876
01:07:29,324 --> 01:07:35,427
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I always like to build a pool with no ladder to get out and so they drown because they're not smart enough to just climb out the side.

877
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:42,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I like going in debug mode and putting them up on the third floor of my house on a balcony that has no way out and a toilet.

878
01:07:42,971 --> 01:07:45,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So that they at least could go to the bathroom but they'd starve to death.

879
01:07:46,012 --> 01:07:49,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't you try to build the diving board really high up into the pool?

880
01:07:49,354 --> 01:07:49,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, on the third floor.

881
01:07:49,914 --> 01:07:53,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And what you were going to do is you were going to pause it while they were in midair and then take out the pool?

882
01:07:54,352 --> 01:07:58,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to do that, or I wanted to put the diving board out so that they, you know...

883
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:17,135
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite thing to do is just to make the human terrarium where you get all clear doors, glass walls, and then you get them to go into the room by leaving some chicken or something in there, and then you pause the game and add the other walls so that people can just watch them.

884
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:18,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what I'm going to do.

885
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:24,902
[SPEAKER_09]: You know this new one, they've got a lot of video editing features and that kind of stuff.

886
01:08:26,332 --> 01:08:26,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Saw.

887
01:08:27,514 --> 01:08:28,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

888
01:08:28,596 --> 01:08:30,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if we're going to get any more Strangerhood with The Sims 3.

889
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:34,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that was pretty funny by the guys that do Red vs. Blue.

890
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,822
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had more time, I'd say let's do like an OLR in The Sims.

891
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:38,423
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be fun.

892
01:08:38,463 --> 01:08:39,824
[SPEAKER_06]: We could totally.

893
01:08:40,044 --> 01:08:48,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I will never forget, however, the house that my old roommate built in The Sims where he put like... What was the most people he could have in a house?

894
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:49,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Like six?

895
01:08:49,712 --> 01:08:54,736
[SPEAKER_10]: So he put five men that would all like make out with each other and kiss each other and all this stuff.

896
01:08:54,777 --> 01:08:57,559
[SPEAKER_10]: He put five men in the house and one woman...

897
01:08:58,019 --> 01:08:58,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

898
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:19,661
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

899
01:09:36,963 --> 01:09:37,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

900
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:16,220
[SPEAKER_09]: and basically a quote from John F. Kennedy saying the world is very different now for man holds in his hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.

901
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:24,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And people are thinking, huh, that's probably Front Mission now coming out on 360 or maybe the PS3.

902
01:10:29,722 --> 01:10:31,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

903
01:10:31,524 --> 01:10:36,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Front Mission is a mech military strategy game.

904
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:37,691
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more of a tactical game.

905
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:40,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be very cool if they brought it out.

906
01:10:40,915 --> 01:10:42,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have played this after all.

907
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:45,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I did play this on another system a long time ago.

908
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:47,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

909
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:55,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, apparently, I guess the same image was used at teaser, also in the official Xbox magazine, according to 1UP.

910
01:10:55,967 --> 01:11:02,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And it made very clear, or the teaser text made it very clear that it was going to be front mission for the 360.

911
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:08,233
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, without saying that it is, they, you know, pointed their finger at it.

912
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:10,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Soul Calibur Broken Destiny

913
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:26,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Dampierre Wristblades

914
01:11:47,022 --> 01:11:47,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Soul Calibur Broken Destiny

915
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:09,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken 6

916
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:37,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be on the PSP, though, along with the console version, so that's pretty cool.

917
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:39,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Except it'll have some exclusive content.

918
01:12:39,963 --> 01:12:54,012
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll have certain items, certain stages, and a ghost mode, which means that you can download and share character data to play versus matches with.

919
01:12:54,593 --> 01:12:57,975
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess sort of like how the conquest mode was in...

920
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:06,958
[SPEAKER_07]: The old Soul Calibur in the arcade where we used to beat up each other's characters.

921
01:13:08,059 --> 01:13:10,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty cool.

922
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:11,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to it.

923
01:13:12,544 --> 01:13:12,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

924
01:13:14,139 --> 01:13:15,200
[SPEAKER_09]: S&K The King of Fighters Online

925
01:13:34,563 --> 01:13:37,524
[SPEAKER_09]: No word on whether that's coming out over here as well.

926
01:13:37,564 --> 01:13:42,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I know right now it's supposed to be available in the Asian regions, and it's coming out on the first half of 2010.

927
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:50,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't tell if this is actually a fighting game or a brawler game, but it looks good though, so that's kind of cool.

928
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:53,290
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up with this?

929
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:56,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we just have a King of Fighters shoot-em-up last week, and now we have an RPG?

930
01:13:58,212 --> 01:13:58,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so.

931
01:13:58,732 --> 01:13:59,492
[SPEAKER_09]: They're branching out.

932
01:14:00,413 --> 01:14:00,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

933
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Why suddenly all the King of Fighters love?

934
01:14:03,641 --> 01:14:06,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a fun series, but it's a little weird.

935
01:14:06,103 --> 01:14:06,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, really?

936
01:14:06,604 --> 01:14:07,164
[SPEAKER_10]: A shoot-em-up?

937
01:14:07,885 --> 01:14:08,926
[SPEAKER_10]: With fighting game characters?

938
01:14:09,266 --> 01:14:10,067
[SPEAKER_10]: A role-playing game?

939
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:11,388
[SPEAKER_10]: What the heck?

940
01:14:11,788 --> 01:14:17,653
[SPEAKER_10]: This reminds me of the Mortal Kombat story modes and some of those, um, like, you know, the Mortal Kombat games they had on the Xbox and stuff?

941
01:14:17,673 --> 01:14:19,574
[SPEAKER_10]: You had those story modes that were really cheesy?

942
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,836
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of what this reminds me of for some reason.

943
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:23,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it has anything to do with that.

944
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:24,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

945
01:14:25,396 --> 01:14:30,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week and the end of this half of the show.

946
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:36,722
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have heard us talk about a game previously called Six Days in Fallujah.

947
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:47,927
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a game that was going to be published by Konami, and the game had to do with one of the big battles that happened in, of course, the recent Iraq War that is actually still going on.

948
01:14:48,407 --> 01:14:49,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Konami has pulled the plug on it.

949
01:14:50,975 --> 01:14:51,576
[SPEAKER_10]: with this quote.

950
01:14:51,836 --> 01:14:58,942
[SPEAKER_10]: After seeing the reaction of the video game in the United States and hearing opinions sent through phone calls and email, we decided several days ago not to sell it.

951
01:14:59,603 --> 01:15:05,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And that came from a Konami spokesperson talking to Asahi, which is a Japanese news site.

952
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:16,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't know, though, if the game has been pulled entirely because, you know, the developers, Atomic Games, they could still put it out with another publisher, but this is certainly going to be a dent in it.

953
01:15:18,278 --> 01:15:19,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people are saying, you know what?

954
01:15:19,799 --> 01:15:20,779
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just too soon.

955
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think it was?

956
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think it was too soon for a game like this?

957
01:15:26,422 --> 01:15:26,682
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

958
01:15:27,763 --> 01:15:28,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's relevant.

959
01:15:30,064 --> 01:15:32,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you wait any longer, it loses its relevance.

960
01:15:32,345 --> 01:15:34,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have the same impact it would otherwise.

961
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:35,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of agree.

962
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:36,999
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't like it, don't buy it.

963
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:42,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I went about this game because I don't like war games anyway, whether it's World War II or history wars.

964
01:15:42,523 --> 01:15:45,405
[SPEAKER_10]: There's very few of those types of war games I'm into at all.

965
01:15:45,525 --> 01:15:48,427
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just kind of looped this in with that category.

966
01:15:48,927 --> 01:15:56,572
[SPEAKER_10]: But these memories, there have been people that died in this war that has happened very recently.

967
01:15:56,612 --> 01:15:58,493
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a friend from high school who passed away in Iraq.

968
01:15:58,993 --> 01:15:59,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tragic.

969
01:15:59,334 --> 01:16:03,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And so wouldn't it actually be respectful to pay what they went through justice?

970
01:16:03,256 --> 01:16:04,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

971
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:04,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

972
01:16:05,278 --> 01:16:13,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't have a problem with the game, but I'm just... This actually goes to me with a tendency of people to want to bury their head in the sand and ignore that bad shit happens in the world.

973
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:14,544
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

974
01:16:15,024 --> 01:16:20,148
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people who just want to go, oh, well, that sucks, boo-hoo, Perez Hilton, oh my god.

975
01:16:20,828 --> 01:16:30,932
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's that whole, we want to look past it and not think it was really there by claiming that it's too soon or disrespectful or whatever.

976
01:16:31,032 --> 01:16:34,874
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that people really need to have the reality of the situation driven home.

977
01:16:35,254 --> 01:16:39,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And what better way to do it than a video game that's based off of accounts of people who were there.

978
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:41,530
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

979
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:05,824
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

980
01:17:06,444 --> 01:17:06,684
[SPEAKER_10]: See?

981
01:17:06,724 --> 01:17:07,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're laughing.

982
01:17:07,645 --> 01:17:08,726
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, that's fantastic.

983
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:09,366
[SPEAKER_07]: See?

984
01:17:09,707 --> 01:17:12,029
[SPEAKER_10]: But like, you know, that was the day she died.

985
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,611
[SPEAKER_07]: But this wouldn't be meant to be humorous.

986
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:15,111
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different story.

987
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:15,932
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I know, I know, I know.

988
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:18,294
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm a fan of shock humor.

989
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:19,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong.

990
01:17:19,254 --> 01:17:25,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I say that because we all have different ways of remembering things.

991
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:28,202
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and for me personally, I laughed my ass off at that joke.

992
01:17:28,522 --> 01:17:31,484
[SPEAKER_10]: But I loved Bea Arthur because I grew up on the Golden Girls.

993
01:17:31,524 --> 01:17:33,506
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I remember watching that with my mother, you know.

994
01:17:33,686 --> 01:17:33,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

995
01:17:50,037 --> 01:18:02,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I was saying that people probably take offense to the fact that the game, not only they spoke to, obviously, the soldiers that were fighting over there, but also the insurgents as well, including, you know, some terror cells or that kind of stuff.

996
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,772
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

997
01:18:05,413 --> 01:18:05,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

998
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:06,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It

999
01:18:08,234 --> 01:18:08,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1000
01:18:26,192 --> 01:18:26,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna talk about Bea Arthur.

1001
01:18:55,382 --> 01:18:55,802
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1002
01:19:20,273 --> 01:19:22,755
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the one I picked is, you know, eight years old.

1003
01:19:22,915 --> 01:19:28,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so it's still... But I want to see if our people in the chatroom can figure out what it is based on the intro to the game.

1004
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:31,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

1005
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:35,682
[SPEAKER_05]: James, honey, did something happen to you?

1006
01:19:36,763 --> 01:19:38,824
[SPEAKER_05]: After we got separated in that long hallway?

1007
01:19:42,606 --> 01:19:44,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you confusing me with someone else?

1008
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:52,291
[SPEAKER_05]: You were always so forgetful.

1009
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:54,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that time in the hotel?

1010
01:19:57,432 --> 01:19:57,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Maria?

1011
01:20:00,633 --> 01:20:01,933
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you took everything.

1012
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,974
[SPEAKER_05]: But you forgot that videotape we made.

1013
01:20:07,734 --> 01:20:08,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if it's still there?

1014
01:20:09,035 --> 01:20:10,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, we've got guesses already.

1015
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:12,175
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you know about that?

1016
01:20:12,195 --> 01:20:12,975
[SPEAKER_07]: We're pretty close.

1017
01:20:12,995 --> 01:20:14,016
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Silent Hill 2.

1018
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:16,536
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rod's the first one to get it.

1019
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:17,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, guess what?

1020
01:20:17,737 --> 01:20:18,397
[SPEAKER_07]: You win something.

1021
01:20:19,017 --> 01:20:19,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

1022
01:20:21,069 --> 01:20:29,877
[SPEAKER_10]: TheRobD, you win my TurboGrafx Wow, that was easy Yep I can even take it to him too

1023
01:20:31,482 --> 01:20:31,742
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1024
01:20:32,323 --> 01:20:33,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it to me next week.

1025
01:20:33,103 --> 01:20:34,144
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go take him to TurboGrafx.

1026
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:35,105
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to autograph it.

1027
01:20:35,145 --> 01:20:38,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Rob, you win my no-controller TurboGrafx.

1028
01:20:40,009 --> 01:20:41,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know you were doing a giveaway.

1029
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:43,832
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the surprise.

1030
01:20:43,852 --> 01:20:44,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look at you.

1031
01:20:44,713 --> 01:20:45,013
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1032
01:20:45,814 --> 01:20:48,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I have to just remember where we put it.

1033
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, we've been cleaning.

1034
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:56,742
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, Silent Hill 2 is the game du jour, or I should say of the week.

1035
01:20:59,185 --> 01:21:06,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why I picked Silent Hill 2, even though this is not my favorite of the Silent Hill series, it's a lot of people's favorites.

1036
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:10,416
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to throw the bone out to the big fans of Silent Hill 2.

1037
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:14,320
[SPEAKER_07]: So with this particular...

1038
01:21:16,191 --> 01:21:22,233
[SPEAKER_07]: With this particular game, it's, you know, basically this guy goes back to the town of Silent Hill.

1039
01:21:23,013 --> 01:21:24,653
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, you know, third person's perspective.

1040
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:29,574
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays this dude named James who is mourning the loss of his wife, Mary.

1041
01:21:29,654 --> 01:21:32,015
[SPEAKER_07]: And he gets a letter from her saying to meet at their spot.

1042
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:33,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And instead, he finds Maria.

1043
01:21:34,695 --> 01:21:38,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as the game goes on, it's pretty disturbing Silent Hill stuff.

1044
01:21:39,157 --> 01:21:39,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Blood.

1045
01:21:40,697 --> 01:21:41,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Pyramid Head.

1046
01:21:41,817 --> 01:21:44,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, this game is the introduction of...

1047
01:21:45,618 --> 01:21:47,560
[SPEAKER_07]: By proper name, Red Pyramid.

1048
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:49,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of them, in fact.

1049
01:21:50,103 --> 01:21:51,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.

1050
01:21:51,964 --> 01:21:53,646
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the game that gave us the Red Pyramid.

1051
01:21:55,288 --> 01:21:58,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Or as you all know him as, Happy Funtime Rapey Pyramid Head.

1052
01:21:58,791 --> 01:21:59,231
[SPEAKER_07]: P. Hitty.

1053
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:00,613
[SPEAKER_10]: P. Hitty.

1054
01:22:01,313 --> 01:22:02,374
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I call him, P. Hitty.

1055
01:22:02,555 --> 01:22:03,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're tight like that.

1056
01:22:04,227 --> 01:22:20,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, um, so, you know, you solve your little puzzles, and you pick up things, and you find things, and you get a chainsaw at some point, chainsaw is awesome, um, and, um, which I've seen Shane beat the game with a chainsaw, didn't he?

1057
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:22,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't there for that.

1058
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:50,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you also have multiple endings on this game, so you've got up to, um, you have three endings, um, actually is it, yeah, three endings, I think, involving the actual story of the game.

1059
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:59,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, some of them are really fucked up and sad, um, some of them are, oh, there's one that's kind of happy.

1060
01:23:00,405 --> 01:23:04,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get joke endings, you get the UFO ending, which every Silent Hill game has, and

1061
01:23:05,288 --> 01:23:07,430
[SPEAKER_07]: and then my favorite, the dog ending.

1062
01:23:11,674 --> 01:23:19,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, with the dog ending, it shows that a Shiba Inu is actually controlling the entire events of the game.

1063
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:21,562
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the UFO ending, James gets abducted.

1064
01:23:22,543 --> 01:23:23,624
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also, though...

1065
01:23:25,771 --> 01:23:25,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1066
01:23:28,693 --> 01:23:30,013
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the music from the dog ending.

1067
01:23:36,737 --> 01:23:37,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the dog ending.

1068
01:23:37,597 --> 01:23:38,538
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the dog ending, too.

1069
01:23:38,918 --> 01:23:40,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like, he goes, what?

1070
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:41,279
[SPEAKER_07]: You did all this?

1071
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:42,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And the dog comes up and licks him.

1072
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:50,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that the dog, though, is wearing headphones listening to a karaoke music.

1073
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I had my audio jammed.

1074
01:23:56,322 --> 01:24:02,126
[SPEAKER_07]: At any rate, there's also some of the newer special versions.

1075
01:24:02,826 --> 01:24:10,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in the special edition releases, there is a game, a little side story called Born from a Wish.

1076
01:24:12,472 --> 01:24:18,916
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is actually in the Restless Dreams edition, or for Europe, the Inner Fears edition.

1077
01:24:18,936 --> 01:24:20,057
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong?

1078
01:24:20,757 --> 01:24:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I just pricked myself.

1079
01:24:21,978 --> 01:24:24,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you okay?

1080
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:50,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to point out, this is a scary, scary game.

1081
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:56,722
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've never played a game like this before, you've got to try these types of survival horror games, especially the Silent Hill series.

1082
01:24:57,002 --> 01:25:01,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm telling you, these games are so scary, they'll make your asshole slam shut.

1083
01:25:01,623 --> 01:25:02,564
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm talking about.

1084
01:25:02,784 --> 01:25:07,425
[SPEAKER_10]: One of those games where you're so tense, you're like, oh my gosh, I'm so scared, I don't know what's going to happen next.

1085
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:10,226
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a scary game.

1086
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:13,027
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think games can't scare you, play a game like this.

1087
01:25:13,956 --> 01:25:16,158
[SPEAKER_10]: with all the lights off during a rainy night.

1088
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:25,107
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest thing, and this is why I like the Silent Hill series so much, is that it's a big look into the disturbing parts of the human psyche.

1089
01:25:25,147 --> 01:25:26,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I like it.

1090
01:25:27,309 --> 01:25:29,811
[SPEAKER_07]: There's actually an enemy in this game who...

1091
01:25:31,933 --> 01:25:33,654
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1092
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:56,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, for the main character, you go into a room and he finds the dress that his dead wife wore.

1093
01:25:59,876 --> 01:26:04,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And different things that relate to his psychosis, including the Red Pyramid being part of his psychosis.

1094
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:10,644
[SPEAKER_07]: The only character who does not see any of the monsters in the game is a little girl, because she is innocent.

1095
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:13,806
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't have those type of deep-rooted...

1096
01:26:15,781 --> 01:26:17,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though I seem to recall her being kind of a bitch.

1097
01:26:41,433 --> 01:26:45,483
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a character based off of Eddie Murphy when he was supposed to be more pleasant.

1098
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:50,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And a character named Angela who was based off of the protagonist in The Net.

1099
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:52,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I never realized that.

1100
01:26:53,054 --> 01:26:53,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1101
01:26:53,434 --> 01:26:53,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1102
01:26:54,575 --> 01:27:02,340
[SPEAKER_07]: They've all been... And also, and this is something I didn't know, this layout of Silent Hill in the game was based off of San Bruno, California.

1103
01:27:04,561 --> 01:27:08,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is, to me, one of the best games ever.

1104
01:27:08,184 --> 01:27:09,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the soundtrack.

1105
01:27:09,264 --> 01:27:15,028
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually used to wake up every morning to the theme of Lara, which was on that soundtrack.

1106
01:27:15,668 --> 01:27:16,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Every morning.

1107
01:27:16,749 --> 01:27:19,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Until I got sick of it and had to change it to The Birthday Massacre.

1108
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:26,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, if anyone wants to know about the movie, yeah, the second movie's coming, but Gonzo's not involved.

1109
01:27:26,823 --> 01:27:28,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So, has nothing to do with the game, though.

1110
01:27:29,604 --> 01:27:36,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as far as this game and that story being involved together.

1111
01:27:36,747 --> 01:27:38,268
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Silent Hill 2 is freaking rad.

1112
01:27:39,168 --> 01:27:39,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Play it.

1113
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:43,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, my favorite is Silent Hill 3.

1114
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:45,051
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1115
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:46,210
[SPEAKER_10]: SILENT HILL 3

1116
01:28:08,976 --> 01:28:09,416
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1117
01:28:31,576 --> 01:28:33,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay tuned, because guess what?

1118
01:28:33,377 --> 01:28:36,138
[SPEAKER_10]: The contest, you know, I didn't even know.

1119
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:38,179
[SPEAKER_10]: It was such a surprise contest we just had on the show.

1120
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:39,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know it was happening.

1121
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,701
[SPEAKER_10]: But DarkSakura just gave away TurboGrafx-16.

1122
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,182
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not the only thing we're giving away tonight.

1123
01:28:43,222 --> 01:28:49,065
[SPEAKER_10]: We are giving away a signed autographed copy of DDR on the PlayStation 2, signed by SmileDK.

1124
01:28:49,525 --> 01:28:53,347
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's thanks to Bress Lowell, who got that at the SakuraCon.

1125
01:28:53,707 --> 01:28:54,667
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to be...

1126
01:28:56,128 --> 01:28:58,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Telling you more about that contest very soon on the podcast.

1127
01:28:58,511 --> 01:28:59,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Just stay tuned.

1128
01:28:59,912 --> 01:29:01,474
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not something you have to be listening to live.

1129
01:29:01,694 --> 01:29:05,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Our podcast listeners will get a chance to win this as well, as well as our live listeners.

1130
01:29:05,518 --> 01:29:06,179
[SPEAKER_10]: So stay tuned.

1131
01:29:06,459 --> 01:29:08,602
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1132
01:29:15,157 --> 01:29:33,961
[SPEAKER_10]: and we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and guess what guys it's time to do the giveaway or at least I'm going to tell you guys a little more about the giveaway but first we are going to turn the moderation on in the chat room there so that there's no talking amongst chat so that you guys don't try to give away the answers to each other here's how it's going to work is that what we're going to do we're going to play five clips

1133
01:29:34,381 --> 01:29:35,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1134
01:29:52,473 --> 01:29:59,558
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you know the answers to those, we'll draw one from the total, whoever has the most correct answers, we'll draw from that.

1135
01:29:59,618 --> 01:30:05,062
[SPEAKER_10]: So even if you don't know all five, send it in anyway, because if people can only get four of the five, you might still win.

1136
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:14,189
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, what you're going to win, a copy of DDR Supernova II for the PlayStation 2, autographed by SmileDK, who is infamous for Butterfly.

1137
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:17,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And various other DDR songs as well, you should know them if you're a fan.

1138
01:30:18,032 --> 01:30:19,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yo, don't block me, don't beat, just watch me

1139
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:48,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is song number three.

1140
01:30:58,018 --> 01:31:00,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is song number four.

1141
01:31:09,941 --> 01:31:13,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, here is song number five.

1142
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1143
01:31:44,242 --> 01:31:48,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure the subject says contest somewhere in it or it will not count.

1144
01:31:49,063 --> 01:31:49,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't stress that enough.

1145
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:53,784
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to put contest in the subject or something with the word contest in it.

1146
01:31:53,824 --> 01:31:55,504
[SPEAKER_10]: You can put I love Rob, contest.

1147
01:31:55,804 --> 01:31:58,184
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as the word contest is in there, it'll be cool.

1148
01:31:58,544 --> 01:31:59,005
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1149
01:31:59,945 --> 01:32:02,665
[SPEAKER_10]: The five songs for the contest this week.

1150
01:32:03,125 --> 01:32:06,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Giving away an autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2 by SmileDK.

1151
01:32:06,806 --> 01:32:09,986
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'm going to let you guys be able to talk and chat again.

1152
01:32:10,046 --> 01:32:11,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So no giving away answers.

1153
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:12,967
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, no giving away answers.

1154
01:32:13,715 --> 01:32:14,015
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

1155
01:32:14,356 --> 01:32:14,576
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1156
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:16,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1157
01:32:17,979 --> 01:32:20,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we're ready to get back into tonight's Orange Lounge Radio, so let's do it.

1158
01:32:20,822 --> 01:32:29,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the 3rd of 2009, where we tape live every Sunday night, of course, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1159
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:37,678
[SPEAKER_10]: On All Games Radio, www.allgames.com is where we tape our show and allow you guys to interact with us through ways such as chat and so on and so on.

1160
01:32:38,038 --> 01:32:39,139
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1161
01:32:55,988 --> 01:32:58,789
[SPEAKER_09]: is a game being shown off on the Xbox 360.

1162
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:03,971
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an alpha version of what looks like a remake of Turtles in Time.

1163
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:13,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the looks of it, you would probably guess that it's for Xbox Live Arcade, but of course, possibly could make its way to the PlayStation Network and WiiWare as well.

1164
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:18,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And it looks kind of cool, but definitely looks like Xbox Live Arcade material.

1165
01:33:22,003 --> 01:33:23,104
[SPEAKER_09]: So, pretty cool.

1166
01:33:24,026 --> 01:33:26,188
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is a game a lot of people are very excited about.

1167
01:33:26,228 --> 01:33:30,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it's alpha right now, so it could be a while.

1168
01:33:30,874 --> 01:33:32,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that they've kind of re-skinned it.

1169
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:36,000
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just a re-release of the game, but they've totally re-skinned the whole thing, which is kind of cool.

1170
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:36,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it looks nice.

1171
01:33:38,744 --> 01:33:40,306
[SPEAKER_10]: So, alright.

1172
01:33:40,786 --> 01:33:41,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

1173
01:33:41,804 --> 01:33:42,545
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

1174
01:34:07,361 --> 01:34:07,722
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOXLIVE ARCADE

1175
01:34:26,636 --> 01:34:33,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the Edinburgh Zoo renames their Wolverine in honor of Wolverine.

1176
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,461
[SPEAKER_07]: They named him Logan.

1177
01:34:36,562 --> 01:34:43,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess the tie-in that this has is that the picture that they put up is a picture of the Wolverine and behind him was one for the game Standy.

1178
01:34:44,307 --> 01:34:53,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are using the, I guess, the fame of the movie right now to promote the fact that these are endangered animals, so...

1179
01:34:54,787 --> 01:34:55,748
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1180
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:16,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I had lots to do.

1181
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:34,215
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens.

1182
01:35:35,176 --> 01:35:35,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

1183
01:35:36,017 --> 01:35:36,637
[SPEAKER_10]: More gaming news.

1184
01:35:37,038 --> 01:35:37,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1185
01:35:38,439 --> 01:35:38,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1186
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:43,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we've got some other, well, kind of unfortunate news.

1187
01:35:44,443 --> 01:35:48,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Also kind of tied in with the movies, you know, the whole Batman stuff, very successful movie.

1188
01:35:48,927 --> 01:35:52,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's of course a new game coming out for Batman, Batman Arkham Asylum.

1189
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:54,091
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to be out in June.

1190
01:35:54,391 --> 01:35:57,313
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it's been delayed now to the end of summer.

1191
01:35:58,334 --> 01:35:58,715
[SPEAKER_09]: D'oh!

1192
01:36:00,006 --> 01:36:00,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1193
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:01,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because they can?

1194
01:36:02,907 --> 01:36:12,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, to give the devs an extra amount of time to make sure the game is the highest quality for gamers.

1195
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:16,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in other words, the game's broken right now.

1196
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:16,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got too many bugs.

1197
01:36:16,951 --> 01:36:18,271
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to release it the way it is right now.

1198
01:36:18,652 --> 01:36:19,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

1199
01:36:19,572 --> 01:36:20,492
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it sounds like to me.

1200
01:36:21,572 --> 01:36:24,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it worth the wait, though?

1201
01:36:24,093 --> 01:36:26,114
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're going to fix the problems with the game, it's worth the wait, right?

1202
01:36:26,274 --> 01:36:26,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

1203
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,412
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1204
01:36:51,634 --> 01:36:52,115
[SPEAKER_10]: That they had.

1205
01:36:52,155 --> 01:36:53,895
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the last one I really remember liking.

1206
01:36:54,316 --> 01:36:56,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I heard Lego Batman's pretty good, though.

1207
01:36:56,116 --> 01:36:56,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't checked it out, though.

1208
01:36:57,257 --> 01:36:57,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Supposed to be.

1209
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:58,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played it, though.

1210
01:36:58,497 --> 01:37:00,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played it, so maybe I'm not being fair.

1211
01:37:00,618 --> 01:37:01,079
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

1212
01:37:01,659 --> 01:37:02,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully soon.

1213
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:04,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, moving on.

1214
01:37:06,405 --> 01:37:22,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Lost Planet 2 is the game we knew was coming apparently some new footage has been revealed for Lost Planet 2 and apparently Capcom is trying to get a demo available for E3 and guess what not only is it going to be playable on the show floor at E3 but they are going to try to do one of those you know

1215
01:37:23,466 --> 01:37:25,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring It Home type things on Xbox Live again.

1216
01:37:25,628 --> 01:37:26,409
[SPEAKER_10]: They did with the first one.

1217
01:37:26,489 --> 01:37:31,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, and they'll release a demo during E3 for everybody to play at home via Xbox Live Marketplace.

1218
01:37:32,594 --> 01:37:34,375
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is all from the Capcom Unity blog.

1219
01:37:34,656 --> 01:37:40,861
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some new trailers, some new screenshots that you can look at, and they are hoping that there will be a demo

1220
01:37:41,383 --> 01:37:42,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Available by E3.

1221
01:37:42,484 --> 01:37:46,245
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, there will be four-player co-op in the game, if you haven't heard yet.

1222
01:37:46,585 --> 01:37:48,406
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's going to be a ranking system as well.

1223
01:37:48,586 --> 01:37:51,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can compete for the biggest E-peen in Lost Planet 2.

1224
01:37:52,308 --> 01:37:59,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Which looks to have ditched the snow for more of a... Looks like more of an Amazonian... Well, they didn't really ditch the snow.

1225
01:37:59,131 --> 01:38:01,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the planet's starting to thaw.

1226
01:38:02,133 --> 01:38:02,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1227
01:38:02,473 --> 01:38:04,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Which I guess there was a little bit of it in the first game.

1228
01:38:04,714 --> 01:38:06,595
[SPEAKER_06]: They put it in a defrost setting in the microwave.

1229
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:10,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, because it does look a little thawed out this time, so it looks a little more jungly.

1230
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:17,104
[SPEAKER_10]: You do still see the snow in some parts, but it has more of a lush green look to it than last time.

1231
01:38:18,683 --> 01:38:22,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, there's other things that have, you know, a green look to them, and that would be zombies.

1232
01:38:24,204 --> 01:38:24,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Zombies.

1233
01:38:25,145 --> 01:38:26,725
[SPEAKER_10]: To be green or gray.

1234
01:38:26,765 --> 01:38:29,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, usually they're red after dining on blood.

1235
01:38:29,626 --> 01:38:30,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, enough blood on them, yeah.

1236
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:34,567
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean the flesh tone, you know, it's kind of that green-gray sickly looking thing.

1237
01:38:35,107 --> 01:38:37,007
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is news about Dead Rising 2.

1238
01:38:39,508 --> 01:38:43,229
[SPEAKER_07]: When they said that there were going to be multiplayer sessions, well...

1239
01:38:45,487 --> 01:38:49,370
[SPEAKER_07]: They were actually correct on that one.

1240
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:54,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom said that there will be online multiplayer.

1241
01:38:54,794 --> 01:38:56,375
[SPEAKER_07]: No details on it, but it said that there will be.

1242
01:38:57,016 --> 01:38:57,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's cool.

1243
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:04,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the one thing that Dead Rising 1 was missing is going to be in Dead Rising 2.

1244
01:39:04,442 --> 01:39:05,683
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds pretty amazing to me.

1245
01:39:06,263 --> 01:39:08,425
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you can still run over Amina with a L'Amour.

1246
01:39:09,626 --> 01:39:10,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully.

1247
01:39:10,226 --> 01:39:10,827
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm hoping for.

1248
01:39:10,847 --> 01:39:12,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they were showing off some pretty cool stuff.

1249
01:39:12,828 --> 01:39:15,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently the main character now, since he's not, you know...

1250
01:39:16,371 --> 01:39:17,272
[SPEAKER_09]: A photographer.

1251
01:39:17,372 --> 01:39:18,973
[SPEAKER_09]: He's more of like a carpenter guy.

1252
01:39:19,013 --> 01:39:20,593
[SPEAKER_09]: He can kind of fashion his own weapons.

1253
01:39:20,634 --> 01:39:26,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So he had like two chainsaws strapped to this giant stick.

1254
01:39:26,877 --> 01:39:31,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he strapped two chainsaws to his motorcycle and drove through a crowd of zombies.

1255
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So he gets the MacGyverism skill.

1256
01:39:33,841 --> 01:39:37,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and apparently they had up to 7,000 zombies on screen at a time.

1257
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,926
[SPEAKER_09]: So that sounds sweet.

1258
01:39:42,906 --> 01:39:45,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing that sounds kind of sweet, actually, even though the first game...

1259
01:39:46,974 --> 01:39:47,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Very disappointing.

1260
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:48,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Steel 2.

1261
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:54,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Red Steel 2 has been announced, and it's apparently going to the Wild West.

1262
01:39:55,258 --> 01:39:58,620
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to feature MotionPlus support.

1263
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:04,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not really sure if it's actually a Wild West game, but the main character kind of looks like he could be on the Wild West.

1264
01:40:06,761 --> 01:40:08,041
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1265
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:39,142
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 in chat disagrees, says no, Red Steel 2 will suck.

1266
01:41:04,924 --> 01:41:07,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says they'll probably bundle Red Steel 2 with Motion Plus.

1267
01:41:08,987 --> 01:41:10,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're doing a lot of those bundles.

1268
01:41:10,309 --> 01:41:11,950
[SPEAKER_09]: They gotta try to sell that Motion Plus.

1269
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:15,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So does this mean that Motion Plus is gonna be required for the game?

1270
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:16,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's what they're saying right now.

1271
01:41:16,594 --> 01:41:17,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1272
01:41:18,776 --> 01:41:22,479
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they don't have a bundle with Motion Plus, aren't they severely limiting their audience?

1273
01:41:23,897 --> 01:41:24,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

1274
01:41:24,858 --> 01:41:30,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I would think the people that would buy this would not necessarily be the same audience that's going to pick up a game like Wii Sports Resort.

1275
01:41:30,564 --> 01:41:33,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, MotionPlus is going to be sold separately, though, a month prior to that.

1276
01:41:33,807 --> 01:41:36,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've also got a bundle with Tiger Woods.

1277
01:41:36,369 --> 01:41:41,554
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also doing a bundle with EA Sports Tennis Grand Slam that's going to be...

1278
01:41:42,615 --> 01:41:46,356
[SPEAKER_09]: or Grand Slam Tennis that's coming out before Tiger Woods even in Europe.

1279
01:41:47,097 --> 01:41:48,937
[SPEAKER_09]: And who knows how many more bundles with this thing.

1280
01:41:48,997 --> 01:41:51,378
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to sell those Motion Plus things.

1281
01:41:51,718 --> 01:41:58,201
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got to get people to realize, hey, you guys should spend another $20 on sensors that should have been in there in the first place.

1282
01:41:59,461 --> 01:42:00,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1283
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:02,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can come out with the controller with the sensors built in.

1284
01:42:02,942 --> 01:42:03,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Ha, bitches!

1285
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they can think of something else they forgot.

1286
01:42:07,702 --> 01:42:11,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it'll be, oh, but now you want to get the Wii HD so that our graphics can be on there.

1287
01:42:11,464 --> 01:42:16,387
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to get the Wii Balance Board Plus because now it has more sensors and it's even more sensitive than before.

1288
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:19,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you anything you'll see something stupid like that.

1289
01:42:21,651 --> 01:42:23,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, haven't there already been rumors of a Wii Fit Plus?

1290
01:42:24,092 --> 01:42:30,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there has been a Wii Fit Plus with the Balance Board, but I don't know if that's just the same Balance Board.

1291
01:42:30,276 --> 01:42:31,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be the same Balance Board, I mean.

1292
01:42:32,932 --> 01:42:36,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, have you ever tried controlling balance board games?

1293
01:42:36,475 --> 01:42:37,255
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not very fun.

1294
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:39,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Just Wii Fit, and it works okay.

1295
01:42:40,058 --> 01:42:40,518
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that bad.

1296
01:42:40,578 --> 01:42:41,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the marble rolling game?

1297
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:42,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's alright.

1298
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,681
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very, very sensitive.

1299
01:42:44,802 --> 01:42:46,323
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very, very, very sensitive.

1300
01:42:46,463 --> 01:42:50,206
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think because those games are supposed to challenge your balance, it's why it's that way.

1301
01:42:50,626 --> 01:42:52,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played any of the standalone balance games.

1302
01:42:52,528 --> 01:42:57,592
[SPEAKER_10]: There hasn't been anything that really, you know, caught my eye that I really want to get.

1303
01:42:59,056 --> 01:42:59,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Adventure 2600 Reboot

1304
01:43:29,957 --> 01:43:36,203
[SPEAKER_10]: and we're looking at a little YouTube here in studio what this game looks like and it's pretty cool because they actually have the dragon flying around and

1305
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:37,600
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1306
01:44:00,427 --> 01:44:03,329
[SPEAKER_10]: and he had a whole little interview with GameSetWatch talking about it.

1307
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:05,591
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a whole team of people.

1308
01:44:05,631 --> 01:44:10,134
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't just this guy but he was kind of the spokesperson talking about the project.

1309
01:44:10,675 --> 01:44:11,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So pretty cool.

1310
01:44:13,337 --> 01:44:14,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I might have to check this out.

1311
01:44:15,038 --> 01:44:15,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think you will?

1312
01:44:16,059 --> 01:44:16,319
[SPEAKER_07]: For real?

1313
01:44:16,339 --> 01:44:16,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I will.

1314
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:17,440
[SPEAKER_10]: For real.

1315
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:24,885
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to find this it's at slashx.googlepages.com There's a whole little page about the Adventure 2600 reboot.

1316
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:27,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And I get the sense why?

1317
01:44:27,507 --> 01:44:28,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we can.

1318
01:44:30,182 --> 01:44:31,584
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura is going to dive in.

1319
01:44:52,392 --> 01:44:53,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Pye Pye Pye always wins

1320
01:45:12,802 --> 01:45:14,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we actually have one from Dan Shadow.

1321
01:45:14,743 --> 01:45:16,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, what's more dangerous, chimps or raptors?

1322
01:45:16,824 --> 01:45:17,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Help me out here.

1323
01:45:18,125 --> 01:45:19,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Are these for real tonight?

1324
01:45:19,826 --> 01:45:22,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I am serious, and I'm reading them because you fucking made me.

1325
01:45:23,207 --> 01:45:23,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

1326
01:45:24,948 --> 01:45:26,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Raptors, look at Jurassic Park.

1327
01:45:26,589 --> 01:45:29,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, chimps can carry Ebola virus, like you saw in Outbreak.

1328
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:31,071
[SPEAKER_07]: You're thinking of velociraptors.

1329
01:45:31,331 --> 01:45:31,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

1330
01:45:31,712 --> 01:45:33,112
[SPEAKER_07]: A raptor is like a hawk.

1331
01:45:33,433 --> 01:45:35,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't velociraptors a kind of raptor?

1332
01:45:38,475 --> 01:45:40,076
[SPEAKER_07]: I think chimps are dangerous if you give them a gun.

1333
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:42,439
[SPEAKER_09]: RAPTORS RAPTORS

1334
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:07,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I would bet anything the emailer meant to say Velociraptors because raptors by themselves are not that scary.

1335
01:46:07,912 --> 01:46:08,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But Velociraptors?

1336
01:46:08,974 --> 01:46:09,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Terrifying.

1337
01:46:09,594 --> 01:46:10,595
[SPEAKER_09]: They're carnivores.

1338
01:46:10,676 --> 01:46:11,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And raptors the jets.

1339
01:46:12,157 --> 01:46:14,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are pretty dangerous too, you know.

1340
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Skipping on!

1341
01:46:15,942 --> 01:46:17,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Flying Velociraptors.

1342
01:46:17,543 --> 01:46:18,224
[SPEAKER_07]: This comes from Gil.

1343
01:46:18,945 --> 01:46:20,006
[SPEAKER_09]: and the monkeys the band.

1344
01:46:20,026 --> 01:46:21,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how dangerous they'd be.

1345
01:46:21,086 --> 01:46:23,648
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my first time writing in and I'll make it a short one.

1346
01:46:23,688 --> 01:46:25,489
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about the new PSP Go?

1347
01:46:25,969 --> 01:46:30,011
[SPEAKER_07]: How long until it will be hacked because the 3000s are not hackable to the public yet?

1348
01:46:30,491 --> 01:46:32,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Should they release the hack or wait for the new PSP?

1349
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:38,436
[SPEAKER_09]: If they were smart they would wait for the new PSP to come out but they won't.

1350
01:46:38,856 --> 01:46:40,217
[SPEAKER_09]: They've already got a sort of

1351
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:44,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Proof of Concept done already for the new PSP 3000.

1352
01:46:45,181 --> 01:46:47,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Hacker groups are pretty competitive.

1353
01:46:47,322 --> 01:46:52,005
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want to sit on it and wait to have someone else beat them or else all their work is for naught.

1354
01:46:52,025 --> 01:47:00,869
[SPEAKER_09]: But you will better believe that when that new system comes out, all they have to say is, it's unhackable, and then they'll be like, oh, we're going to get down on that shit, and it'll be hacked before you know it.

1355
01:47:01,089 --> 01:47:02,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It may take a little bit of time.

1356
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:05,892
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem is it may have to use an exploit in the game to do it.

1357
01:47:07,168 --> 01:47:12,311
[SPEAKER_10]: But it'll be interesting because if everything is downloadable, they'll start to sneak the patches in the games and all that.

1358
01:47:12,431 --> 01:47:14,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'll have to patch.

1359
01:47:15,473 --> 01:47:16,113
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting.

1360
01:47:17,394 --> 01:47:18,615
[SPEAKER_07]: They're always going to find a way.

1361
01:47:18,835 --> 01:47:20,056
[SPEAKER_10]: They're always going to find a way to hack it.

1362
01:47:20,756 --> 01:47:22,497
[SPEAKER_07]: This one, ready for the next email?

1363
01:47:22,998 --> 01:47:23,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1364
01:47:23,478 --> 01:47:27,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, OLR, I was wondering if you guys buy the PSP 3000.

1365
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been thinking, okay, bad grammar.

1366
01:47:30,615 --> 01:47:31,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been thinking about it.

1367
01:47:32,056 --> 01:47:39,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I currently own four PSP2 Slims, and if that, I'm interested in your thoughts because tonight you're going to talk about the PSP.

1368
01:47:39,681 --> 01:47:45,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Guy, it's Y-O-U apostrophe R-E, not Y-O-U-R, that's possessive, duh.

1369
01:47:45,664 --> 01:47:51,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I should ust wait instead of just wait for the rumored PSP2.

1370
01:47:51,408 --> 01:47:53,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the late notice.

1371
01:47:53,829 --> 01:47:55,350
[SPEAKER_07]: L-O-L-C-U in chat.

1372
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:59,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Sincerely, HungryMurcrunk.

1373
01:47:59,893 --> 01:48:00,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Hungry Mr. Crunk.

1374
01:48:01,314 --> 01:48:02,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Was that typed on a PSP?

1375
01:48:03,095 --> 01:48:03,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1376
01:48:03,435 --> 01:48:05,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But it says Hungry Mr. Crunk.

1377
01:48:05,797 --> 01:48:07,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Or your OLR member, Columbia99.

1378
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:11,021
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the question?

1379
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:14,043
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only two periods in this whole thing.

1380
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:15,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Should he get a PSP 3000?

1381
01:48:15,544 --> 01:48:18,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Not when you know that this PSP goes on the horizon.

1382
01:48:18,906 --> 01:48:19,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think so.

1383
01:48:19,807 --> 01:48:20,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't get either.

1384
01:48:21,348 --> 01:48:25,330
[SPEAKER_09]: The PSP 3000 really only had the microphone built in.

1385
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:26,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1386
01:48:26,071 --> 01:48:26,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1387
01:48:28,681 --> 01:48:33,124
[SPEAKER_10]: If you really love your PSP, then wait for the PSP Go.

1388
01:48:33,164 --> 01:48:37,307
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you already have a couple PSPs, which it sounds like you do, I don't see the point.

1389
01:48:38,187 --> 01:48:42,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this PSP Go is not going to have any additional hardware to it that we know of so far.

1390
01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:44,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, granted, they might come out and say something at E3.

1391
01:48:44,671 --> 01:48:45,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, buy one, help the economy.

1392
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:52,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I love how they're like, oh, well, we don't want to add another analog stick to it because then that'll make certain games incompatible.

1393
01:48:53,117 --> 01:48:57,079
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making them all download anyways, so they're going to be incompatible with whatever.

1394
01:48:57,099 --> 01:48:57,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Just have...

1395
01:48:58,736 --> 01:48:59,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy one and help the economy.

1396
01:48:59,837 --> 01:49:00,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Ain't my money, so I don't care.

1397
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:01,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Send your money to me.

1398
01:49:01,098 --> 01:49:01,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll stimulate the economy.

1399
01:49:01,959 --> 01:49:02,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I bet you will.

1400
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:25,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, hey OLR peep shizzles.

1401
01:49:26,573 --> 01:49:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1402
01:49:27,613 --> 01:49:34,298
[SPEAKER_07]: With all the rumors about the PSP 2 or whatever Sony will call it, I was wondering what are your top three features that you want for it?

1403
01:49:34,938 --> 01:49:36,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, this could be a list list.

1404
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:45,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I personally would like a larger screen and separate mini USB device that allows you to load your UMD games onto it for playing games that you already own without switching disks.

1405
01:49:46,546 --> 01:49:48,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I would love dual analog sticks.

1406
01:49:48,968 --> 01:49:50,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Much love, someone who dearly loves old people.

1407
01:49:52,529 --> 01:49:54,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, didn't we already hear from somebody like that?

1408
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:55,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we did.

1409
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:59,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I got kicked from IRC in the middle of that question.

1410
01:49:59,431 --> 01:50:01,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Top three features for the PSP Go?

1411
01:50:01,772 --> 01:50:03,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that you would want to see.

1412
01:50:07,373 --> 01:50:08,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a Tic Tac dispenser.

1413
01:50:09,974 --> 01:50:10,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Made of bacon?

1414
01:50:11,534 --> 01:50:14,195
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I want orange Tic Tacs.

1415
01:50:15,516 --> 01:50:16,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1416
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:21,867
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because they're not going to do much that they're not already doing with the PSP.

1417
01:50:21,907 --> 01:50:22,949
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so hard to say.

1418
01:50:22,969 --> 01:50:26,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, they may as well add like a phone unit on that thing.

1419
01:50:27,058 --> 01:50:27,940
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like one anyway.

1420
01:50:29,805 --> 01:50:35,367
[SPEAKER_10]: The number one thing I want to see is I want to make sure it's easy to download the games and get them on.

1421
01:50:35,447 --> 01:50:37,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see integration with my PC.

1422
01:50:37,628 --> 01:50:43,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see something that when I plug this thing into my PC, it has a cool little front-end system like iTunes.

1423
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:46,431
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got criticized for that earlier by somebody in chat saying iTunes isn't that great.

1424
01:50:46,471 --> 01:50:47,211
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're actually right.

1425
01:50:47,331 --> 01:50:53,633
[SPEAKER_10]: iTunes is not that great, but it still makes managing the device a lot easier than if you didn't have something like that at all.

1426
01:50:54,013 --> 01:50:55,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about something pretty...

1427
01:50:55,794 --> 01:51:00,075
[SPEAKER_10]: for stupid people that will allow me to manage the content on my PSP.

1428
01:51:00,215 --> 01:51:01,655
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I would like more than anything.

1429
01:51:02,015 --> 01:51:02,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, soccer ball!

1430
01:51:03,916 --> 01:51:05,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you watching Loki playing?

1431
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:07,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was watching Loki play because he's a soccer ball.

1432
01:51:07,756 --> 01:51:08,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's my idea.

1433
01:51:09,137 --> 01:51:09,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do you have anything?

1434
01:51:12,057 --> 01:51:13,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Touchscreen would be nice.

1435
01:51:16,378 --> 01:51:17,318
[SPEAKER_09]: A better web browser.

1436
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:19,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1437
01:51:20,421 --> 01:51:20,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Paygle.

1438
01:51:21,322 --> 01:51:22,323
[SPEAKER_09]: More RAM, actually.

1439
01:51:22,423 --> 01:51:23,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they should add more RAM to it.

1440
01:51:23,724 --> 01:51:24,324
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, who cares?

1441
01:51:24,464 --> 01:51:30,790
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just add a more beefy web browser, more RAM, and... Yeah.

1442
01:51:31,490 --> 01:51:32,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Touchscreen would be nice.

1443
01:51:32,751 --> 01:51:33,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Xlink in chat says porn.

1444
01:51:33,992 --> 01:51:35,013
[SPEAKER_10]: PSP needs more porn.

1445
01:51:36,054 --> 01:51:37,015
[SPEAKER_09]: There's plenty of porn out there.

1446
01:51:37,035 --> 01:51:38,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, you can convert it all.

1447
01:51:39,137 --> 01:51:40,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, plus the thing gets on the internet, right?

1448
01:51:40,838 --> 01:51:41,699
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all the porn you need right there.

1449
01:51:41,719 --> 01:51:41,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1450
01:51:41,899 --> 01:51:43,140
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you need a better web browser.

1451
01:51:44,621 --> 01:51:45,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It should have a GPS.

1452
01:51:47,076 --> 01:51:47,676
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be neat.

1453
01:51:48,296 --> 01:51:53,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And it should have, instead of a Tic Tac dispenser, an Altoid dispenser.

1454
01:51:54,077 --> 01:51:55,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And apps like the iPhone.

1455
01:51:55,738 --> 01:51:56,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Open-end development.

1456
01:51:56,758 --> 01:51:57,598
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Tamagotchi.

1457
01:51:58,218 --> 01:51:59,119
[SPEAKER_10]: That's on my list, too.

1458
01:51:59,259 --> 01:51:59,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Open-end development.

1459
01:52:00,499 --> 01:52:06,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It should have the little tiger games on there, like football and all those games.

1460
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:07,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we've given more than three.

1461
01:52:08,841 --> 01:52:10,021
[SPEAKER_10]: This listener should be satisfied.

1462
01:52:10,601 --> 01:52:10,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1463
01:52:12,841 --> 01:52:15,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear God, whoever wrote a novel... Oh, that's Actdeft.

1464
01:52:16,610 --> 01:52:16,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1465
01:52:18,651 --> 01:52:19,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, OLR.

1466
01:52:20,152 --> 01:52:24,094
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your friendly and swine flu-free neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.

1467
01:52:24,354 --> 01:52:28,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I just say, swine flu, what the hell?

1468
01:52:28,636 --> 01:52:30,357
[SPEAKER_10]: People need to stop it.

1469
01:52:31,137 --> 01:52:33,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop it with the swine flu garbage.

1470
01:52:34,118 --> 01:52:36,520
[SPEAKER_10]: More people die from lots of other things.

1471
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:36,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Like...

1472
01:52:38,074 --> 01:52:38,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

1473
01:52:39,695 --> 01:52:46,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll admit, at first, if you go back and read my Twitter, at first I was kind of like, eh, because I was worried that it was actually going to be an outbreak, but like, you know what?

1474
01:52:47,178 --> 01:52:47,618
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not.

1475
01:52:47,898 --> 01:52:49,299
[SPEAKER_10]: More people die from the regular flu.

1476
01:52:49,419 --> 01:52:51,920
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not as big of a deal as people were making it out to be in the beginning.

1477
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:52,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Knock it off.

1478
01:52:53,901 --> 01:52:56,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can eat pork and not get swine flu, by the way.

1479
01:52:57,383 --> 01:53:05,186
[SPEAKER_07]: It made me want to cry when there was an actual caption on CNN saying you do not get swine flu from eating pig.

1480
01:53:07,077 --> 01:53:09,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it's an excuse for people to use swine in everyday conversation

1481
01:53:28,585 --> 01:53:29,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Since this swine flu thing came out.

1482
01:53:29,906 --> 01:53:31,728
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go get pork chops.

1483
01:53:31,768 --> 01:53:32,208
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1484
01:53:32,508 --> 01:53:36,852
[SPEAKER_10]: He actually said on the news, if people will just eat a pork chop a week and some bacon, we'll all be fine.

1485
01:53:36,892 --> 01:53:40,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm thinking in the back of my head, boy, Loki's probably sitting there watching this going, no problem.

1486
01:53:41,876 --> 01:53:42,736
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sitting there watching.

1487
01:53:42,776 --> 01:53:43,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm eating pork.

1488
01:53:44,518 --> 01:53:52,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all our listeners, unless you are Muslim or Jewish or any other religion that doesn't allow you to eat pork.

1489
01:53:52,764 --> 01:53:53,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Or vegetarian or whatever.

1490
01:53:53,845 --> 01:53:54,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Or vegetarian, whatever.

1491
01:53:55,973 --> 01:53:58,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to your local IHOP and order a bacon platter.

1492
01:53:58,894 --> 01:53:59,194
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1493
01:53:59,214 --> 01:54:00,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Please help keep my uncle in business.

1494
01:54:01,434 --> 01:54:02,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Go get some bacon right now.

1495
01:54:03,274 --> 01:54:04,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless, you know, Jewish, whatever.

1496
01:54:04,855 --> 01:54:11,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone get together and just do the bacon march and hold up banners that say, Bacon does not give you swine flu.

1497
01:54:11,456 --> 01:54:11,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat up.

1498
01:54:11,836 --> 01:54:13,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Bacon is meat candy.

1499
01:54:13,917 --> 01:54:14,777
[SPEAKER_10]: H1N1 be damned.

1500
01:54:15,097 --> 01:54:15,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I heart bacon.

1501
01:54:16,497 --> 01:54:17,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Bacon is meat candy.

1502
01:54:19,238 --> 01:54:21,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a shirt for ASEN that says I heart bacon.

1503
01:54:22,198 --> 01:54:23,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I get that quickly?

1504
01:54:23,659 --> 01:54:24,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you could.

1505
01:54:24,259 --> 01:54:25,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a shirt that says I heart bacon.

1506
01:54:26,243 --> 01:54:27,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I borrow it for ASIN?

1507
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:28,285
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1508
01:54:28,326 --> 01:54:28,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn you.

1509
01:54:29,407 --> 01:54:31,289
[SPEAKER_07]: That, of course, was only half one.

1510
01:54:31,609 --> 01:54:31,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1511
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:33,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll figure it out.

1512
01:54:34,153 --> 01:54:35,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, OLR.

1513
01:54:35,114 --> 01:54:36,756
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your... Okay, I already read that part.

1514
01:54:37,997 --> 01:54:43,684
[SPEAKER_07]: As we may already know, Harmonix is going to release some Rock Band games to expand the franchise.

1515
01:54:44,685 --> 01:54:47,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Though what I don't get is why people are bitching and whining about it.

1516
01:54:47,686 --> 01:54:57,968
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, all those that are saying that Harmonix is trying to milk the franchise and are going the way of Activision, look at all the Guitar Hero games that have been released and all those to come in the near future.

1517
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:04,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero Metallica, Smash Hits, Van Halen, On Tour Decades, and the arcade game, just to name a few.

1518
01:55:04,889 --> 01:55:07,990
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, the movie theater had a Guitar Hero arcade, just thought I'd let you know.

1519
01:55:09,351 --> 01:55:12,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Now look at what Harmonix has released or will release at the same time span.

1520
01:55:12,734 --> 01:55:16,779
[SPEAKER_07]: ACDC tracks, Unplugged, The Beatles, Lego Rock Band, and that's it.

1521
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:21,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero has overloaded the market while Rock Band is expanding its current market.

1522
01:55:21,423 --> 01:55:27,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to mention that you can export tracks and play DLC in whatever Rock Band game with no problem except for The Beatles and Unplugged.

1523
01:55:28,471 --> 01:55:29,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't know about Lego yet.

1524
01:55:30,569 --> 01:55:43,364
[SPEAKER_07]: while with Guitar Hero you have to own every disc to be able to play every song you have on them not to mention changing discs every time you want to play a song that's on another disc yes I know this isn't a problem for some but it's still something that would be more quick and useful

1525
01:55:46,505 --> 01:55:51,387
[SPEAKER_07]: To top it off, people are also asking, why Rock Band Unplugged on the PSP?

1526
01:55:52,007 --> 01:55:53,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the reason on that?

1527
01:55:54,028 --> 01:56:01,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the reason is that if they had more info on it, they would know it is a spiritual sequel to Frequency and Amplitude made by Harmonix nonetheless.

1528
01:56:02,292 --> 01:56:09,695
[SPEAKER_07]: No instruments, just press the buttons, and according to what the track is, and of course, according to the rhythm.

1529
01:56:10,575 --> 01:56:14,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And the new songs featured on it will be on the Rock Band Music Store for consoles.

1530
01:56:14,698 --> 01:56:23,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Unplugged will have its own music score, not like Guitar Hero on Tour, in which you need the peripheral to play and you can't play on Tour on your DSi.

1531
01:56:24,064 --> 01:56:29,027
[SPEAKER_07]: And not to mention the awkwardness when you're playing it with EndNote, DLC, whatever.

1532
01:56:30,086 --> 01:56:30,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, whatsoever.

1533
01:56:31,707 --> 01:56:34,528
[SPEAKER_07]: To sum it all up, Rock Band is not turning into guitar heroes.

1534
01:56:34,568 --> 01:56:35,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop bitching about it.

1535
01:56:35,848 --> 01:56:37,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Harmonix knows what they're doing.

1536
01:56:37,069 --> 01:56:38,810
[SPEAKER_07]: That was all in caps, but I feel like screaming.

1537
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:43,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry if this email is a long FU rant, but I need to get it off my chest.

1538
01:56:43,892 --> 01:56:46,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for reading and for listening to your listeners.

1539
01:56:46,533 --> 01:56:47,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Smile face.

1540
01:56:47,253 --> 01:56:50,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy face.

1541
01:56:50,134 --> 01:56:52,335
[SPEAKER_07]: You just, you did the smiley, my favorite smiley.

1542
01:56:52,956 --> 01:56:53,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1543
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:53,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1544
01:56:55,009 --> 01:57:00,085
I agree that Rock Band isn't milking it as bad as Guitar Hero, but I worry that it might be going that direction.

1545
01:57:00,185 --> 01:57:02,392
If this Lego thing will not let you import songs

1546
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:05,060
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to.

1547
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:05,940
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a different publisher.

1548
01:57:06,581 --> 01:57:07,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the only reason.

1549
01:57:07,821 --> 01:57:08,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, my mic wasn't on.

1550
01:57:08,801 --> 01:57:09,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1551
01:57:09,322 --> 01:57:13,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, if this rock band will not let you import songs, I'm going to be very disappointed.

1552
01:57:13,603 --> 01:57:14,183
[SPEAKER_10]: This Lego one.

1553
01:57:14,463 --> 01:57:16,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think rock bands jumped the shark as bad as Guitar Hero, though.

1554
01:57:16,424 --> 01:57:17,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be surprised if they let you.

1555
01:57:17,984 --> 01:57:22,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's going to be too many problems because it's a different publisher, but if it were the same publisher, I'm sure they would let you.

1556
01:57:22,966 --> 01:57:23,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Same with the Beatles thing.

1557
01:57:23,766 --> 01:57:25,287
[SPEAKER_09]: The Beatles thing, they have a special deal there.

1558
01:57:25,747 --> 01:57:27,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, Beatles only.

1559
01:57:27,507 --> 01:57:32,269
[SPEAKER_09]: If they come out with a Rock Band 3, you better believe all that stuff from the other games are going to be, you know...

1560
01:57:33,129 --> 01:57:33,689
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1561
01:58:01,531 --> 01:58:05,233
[SPEAKER_09]: and in place, you're getting these standalone games that you have to spend $60 for.

1562
01:58:06,414 --> 01:58:06,794
[SPEAKER_09]: No thanks.

1563
01:58:08,155 --> 01:58:09,456
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, those are optional too.

1564
01:58:10,636 --> 01:58:12,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I want to make a comment about emails.

1565
01:58:13,098 --> 01:58:21,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Henceforth, unless I feel otherwise at the moment, if I get any more emails during the show, I'm probably not going to read them until next week.

1566
01:58:21,443 --> 01:58:24,925
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you may as well just understand that.

1567
01:58:25,825 --> 01:58:26,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, good idea.

1568
01:58:27,026 --> 01:58:28,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, last email comes from Cheeseburger.

1569
01:58:30,199 --> 01:58:34,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey guys, sometimes you talk about how you need to stop getting on random tangents.

1570
01:58:34,502 --> 01:58:39,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would just like to say that I would not listen to OLR if not for the personality from each host.

1571
01:58:39,426 --> 01:58:43,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Random food news and political talk are just random tangents about randomness.

1572
01:58:43,769 --> 01:58:45,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen random you so much in a sentence before.

1573
01:58:46,491 --> 01:58:51,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, that's what makes OLR different from other video game shows.

1574
01:58:52,235 --> 01:58:54,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I'm not in the mood for just straight video game news.

1575
01:58:55,137 --> 01:58:56,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes I want a good laugh.

1576
01:58:56,318 --> 01:58:57,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep on podcasting.

1577
01:58:58,493 --> 01:59:02,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind that the bitching about tangents is also part of what makes the show the show.

1578
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:04,883
[SPEAKER_10]: So it all goes hand in hand.

1579
01:59:05,244 --> 01:59:08,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Brought to you by Halo 3, home of the never-ending four-year-old rocket noobs.

1580
01:59:11,674 --> 01:59:12,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over!

1581
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:13,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1582
01:59:37,782 --> 01:59:38,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1583
01:59:53,884 --> 01:59:55,125
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the deal there.

1584
01:59:55,165 --> 01:59:58,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the developer doesn't really matter if it's going to be in the same series.

1585
01:59:58,488 --> 02:00:00,930
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like Guitar Hero has been developed by a bunch of different people.

1586
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:08,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's been Harmonix for a lot of it, but then now they have... I don't remember the last developers doing a new one.

1587
02:00:08,916 --> 02:00:09,577
[SPEAKER_09]: For Guitar Hero?

1588
02:00:09,597 --> 02:00:10,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Neversoft.

1589
02:00:10,217 --> 02:00:10,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Neversoft, yeah.

1590
02:00:11,378 --> 02:00:11,618
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1591
02:00:13,733 --> 02:00:15,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not developer, it's publisher.

1592
02:00:15,354 --> 02:00:17,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And because it's a different publisher, it's not EA.

1593
02:00:18,315 --> 02:00:24,939
[SPEAKER_09]: If EA was putting it out, then yeah, I'm sure they could do some sort of way to port that stuff over.

1594
02:00:24,999 --> 02:00:28,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But because it's Warner, it's a little different.

1595
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:29,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1596
02:00:30,041 --> 02:00:37,986
[SPEAKER_09]: But also because it's Warner, it may have some good music in it because they do have the Warner Music license.

1597
02:00:39,107 --> 02:00:43,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, kind of completely off the topic of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

1598
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:45,572
[SPEAKER_09]: 1 vs. 100.

1599
02:00:45,892 --> 02:00:55,338
[SPEAKER_09]: You may remember that they kind of teased this actually last E3 when they were showing the brand new Xbox interface.

1600
02:00:56,319 --> 02:00:57,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, of course, the

1601
02:00:58,140 --> 02:00:59,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1602
02:01:15,012 --> 02:01:27,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, they have a little teaser trailer for it, and of course, you know, you're going to be able to play with your avatars, um, play as part of the, you know, the mob, or the person actually playing the show, or as the audience.

1603
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:32,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So that looks kind of cool, and they're going to be doing, you know, we can win real prizes.

1604
02:01:32,363 --> 02:01:33,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, sounds like fun.

1605
02:01:33,843 --> 02:01:35,925
[SPEAKER_10]: How do they pick the person that's going to be the one?

1606
02:01:36,205 --> 02:01:36,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1607
02:01:36,825 --> 02:01:37,526
[SPEAKER_10]: That's interesting.

1608
02:01:38,246 --> 02:01:38,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1609
02:01:38,346 --> 02:01:38,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1610
02:01:38,466 --> 02:01:38,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1611
02:02:02,802 --> 02:02:05,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it'll be interesting to see how it works.

1612
02:02:06,165 --> 02:02:08,628
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure we'll see more about it at E3.

1613
02:02:08,888 --> 02:02:10,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see more about it too.

1614
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:12,812
[SPEAKER_09]: You think it's not going to release to the network before E3?

1615
02:02:13,232 --> 02:02:15,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It might actually, because it's supposed to be coming this month, I thought.

1616
02:02:15,955 --> 02:02:16,656
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I thought too.

1617
02:02:16,916 --> 02:02:18,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Or last month, April, wasn't it?

1618
02:02:18,577 --> 02:02:18,998
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was May.

1619
02:02:19,258 --> 02:02:19,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, me.

1620
02:02:20,198 --> 02:02:20,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1621
02:02:21,219 --> 02:02:24,580
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe we'll see it just before E3 and we'll hear about the next game show at E3.

1622
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:25,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, maybe.

1623
02:02:25,761 --> 02:02:29,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe they're going to hold it off until June and then announce some more stuff at E3.

1624
02:02:30,683 --> 02:02:33,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm afraid of embarrassing myself with my lack of knowledge.

1625
02:02:33,644 --> 02:02:34,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my question.

1626
02:02:34,504 --> 02:02:38,066
[SPEAKER_10]: How are they going to prevent people from having a laptop right next to them Googling all the answers?

1627
02:02:38,346 --> 02:02:38,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1628
02:02:38,626 --> 02:02:39,446
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I want to know.

1629
02:02:39,466 --> 02:02:46,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Because one of the questions they show off in the trailer, they're all, you know, the director of 300 also directed what other movie?

1630
02:02:46,689 --> 02:02:47,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like...

1631
02:02:48,911 --> 02:02:50,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Watchmen, they gave two other ones.

1632
02:02:51,752 --> 02:02:52,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1633
02:02:52,672 --> 02:02:53,373
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know who?

1634
02:02:54,373 --> 02:02:55,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people wouldn't.

1635
02:02:55,714 --> 02:02:56,534
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people wouldn't.

1636
02:02:58,395 --> 02:03:00,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Nerds do, but other people don't.

1637
02:03:01,317 --> 02:03:03,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, you could totally Google that stuff.

1638
02:03:03,138 --> 02:03:05,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're going to be given a certain time limit or something.

1639
02:03:07,301 --> 02:03:12,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's not going to be like the TV show where you can just sit there going, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1640
02:03:12,345 --> 02:03:15,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Tiger Claw says, didn't 1 vs. 100 get cancelled on TV?

1641
02:03:15,567 --> 02:03:15,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it did.

1642
02:03:16,648 --> 02:03:24,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, says, uh, you were also scored on time, so they can Google it, but they will get a crappy score.

1643
02:03:25,455 --> 02:03:25,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1644
02:03:26,476 --> 02:03:27,937
[SPEAKER_10]: How is that going to play into it on 1 vs. 100?

1645
02:03:27,977 --> 02:03:30,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'm going to have to see how it kind of looks.

1646
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:32,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there you go.

1647
02:03:33,735 --> 02:03:36,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Furniture racing, card boxing, log cutting, mud sliding, tuna tossing...

1648
02:04:03,191 --> 02:04:05,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheese rolling and extreme ironing.

1649
02:04:06,032 --> 02:04:08,172
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all real sports, too.

1650
02:04:08,612 --> 02:04:08,912
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1651
02:04:09,313 --> 02:04:11,033
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all real sports from around the world.

1652
02:04:11,313 --> 02:04:12,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheese rolling, yeah.

1653
02:04:12,313 --> 02:04:15,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've heard of cheese rolling, but tuna tossing?

1654
02:04:15,574 --> 02:04:16,214
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds dirty.

1655
02:04:16,334 --> 02:04:18,975
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like toss your cookies.

1656
02:04:19,155 --> 02:04:20,515
[SPEAKER_09]: That's from New Zealand, I think.

1657
02:04:20,555 --> 02:04:21,475
[SPEAKER_09]: New Zealand or Australia.

1658
02:04:21,516 --> 02:04:22,096
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of those.

1659
02:04:22,136 --> 02:04:23,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they going to have an event for tossing your salad?

1660
02:04:24,496 --> 02:04:25,496
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's not a sport.

1661
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:29,330
[SPEAKER_09]: For some it is.

1662
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:31,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm afraid to say it's not a sport.

1663
02:04:31,991 --> 02:04:33,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like DDR will never be a sport.

1664
02:04:34,791 --> 02:04:35,472
[SPEAKER_09]: For some it's a sport.

1665
02:04:35,532 --> 02:04:37,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Tossing your salad would be a hobby.

1666
02:04:38,252 --> 02:04:40,313
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have any leagues for that, okay?

1667
02:04:40,333 --> 02:04:40,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1668
02:04:40,793 --> 02:04:43,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe someone should start one.

1669
02:04:45,194 --> 02:04:47,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that'd be a big step backwards there.

1670
02:04:48,495 --> 02:04:50,355
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just looking forward to Extreme Ironing.

1671
02:04:50,435 --> 02:04:51,535
[SPEAKER_10]: How is that a sport?

1672
02:04:54,096 --> 02:04:54,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1673
02:04:55,506 --> 02:04:57,007
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it not a sport, Rob, huh?

1674
02:04:57,127 --> 02:04:57,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1675
02:04:57,588 --> 02:04:58,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1676
02:04:58,108 --> 02:05:01,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I could say, so I could say, you know, instead of get back to work, get back to training.

1677
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:05,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at the trailer here, by the way, if you want to know what the noise is you hear in the background.

1678
02:05:06,495 --> 02:05:06,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

1679
02:05:06,795 --> 02:05:07,816
[SPEAKER_10]: That guy looks like Naruto.

1680
02:05:08,256 --> 02:05:08,657
[SPEAKER_10]: He does.

1681
02:05:09,657 --> 02:05:10,738
[SPEAKER_10]: That car just fell apart.

1682
02:05:10,878 --> 02:05:12,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Naruto and Wario had a baby.

1683
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:14,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was towards the end here.

1684
02:05:14,261 --> 02:05:15,282
[SPEAKER_10]: They had, yeah, here's that.

1685
02:05:15,302 --> 02:05:17,323
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy's doing the tuna tossing and there's the cheese.

1686
02:05:17,564 --> 02:05:18,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen that.

1687
02:05:18,304 --> 02:05:19,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen the cheese rolling.

1688
02:05:19,505 --> 02:05:20,246
[SPEAKER_10]: That I've seen before.

1689
02:05:22,287 --> 02:05:27,288
[SPEAKER_10]: But then they have the extreme ironing here towards the end, which I just did not recognize at all.

1690
02:05:27,308 --> 02:05:28,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, what the hell is this?

1691
02:05:49,218 --> 02:05:50,839
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I guess so.

1692
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:54,202
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole little article here on extreme ironing.

1693
02:05:54,943 --> 02:05:59,706
[SPEAKER_10]: A performance art in which people take an ironing board to a remote location and iron items of clothing.

1694
02:06:01,007 --> 02:06:06,712
[SPEAKER_10]: The latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt.

1695
02:06:08,193 --> 02:06:09,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god!

1696
02:06:09,414 --> 02:06:15,959
[SPEAKER_10]: There's this person ironing on top of a big rock in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1697
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:17,721
[SPEAKER_10]: This is amazing!

1698
02:06:19,212 --> 02:06:21,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know shit like this existed in the world.

1699
02:06:22,114 --> 02:06:22,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

1700
02:06:22,514 --> 02:06:23,275
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to do this.

1701
02:06:23,615 --> 02:06:25,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything exists.

1702
02:06:25,557 --> 02:06:27,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I could be an extreme ironer.

1703
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:32,281
[SPEAKER_10]: All I have to do is climb the fucking rock and then iron a shirt at the top of that.

1704
02:06:32,382 --> 02:06:32,882
[SPEAKER_10]: That's easy.

1705
02:06:33,062 --> 02:06:36,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I do my ironing in a rotating cylindrical container with heat.

1706
02:06:37,245 --> 02:06:38,046
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what that's called?

1707
02:06:38,606 --> 02:06:39,347
[SPEAKER_07]: My dryer.

1708
02:06:42,469 --> 02:06:43,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that's pretty cool.

1709
02:06:44,370 --> 02:06:46,412
[SPEAKER_07]: How about something else that has to do with rolling, Rob?

1710
02:06:46,532 --> 02:06:47,713
[SPEAKER_10]: They call them ironists.

1711
02:06:49,460 --> 02:06:50,280
[SPEAKER_07]: How about more rolling?

1712
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:50,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fine.

1713
02:06:50,981 --> 02:06:52,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Rolling and rolling.

1714
02:06:53,982 --> 02:06:57,424
[SPEAKER_07]: What is our favorite thing to roll ever?

1715
02:06:57,504 --> 02:06:57,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Cheese?

1716
02:06:59,104 --> 02:07:00,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Sushi?

1717
02:07:01,445 --> 02:07:01,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Money.

1718
02:07:02,526 --> 02:07:03,686
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Katamari?

1719
02:07:04,487 --> 02:07:05,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1720
02:07:06,408 --> 02:07:08,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yes, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we love Katamari.

1721
02:07:08,929 --> 02:07:09,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

1722
02:07:09,569 --> 02:07:10,149
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1723
02:07:10,169 --> 02:07:11,270
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1724
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:13,891
[SPEAKER_06]: You're scaring me.

1725
02:07:19,537 --> 02:07:20,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Read your damn story.

1726
02:07:39,986 --> 02:07:45,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Katamari is going to be on PS3 with Katamari Forever, which I believe we might have mentioned before.

1727
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:47,791
[SPEAKER_09]: We mentioned the Japanese one, yeah.

1728
02:07:48,111 --> 02:07:52,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a trailer out with different wild animals making commentary on it.

1729
02:07:54,355 --> 02:08:00,059
[SPEAKER_07]: The cool thing is that it's going to have different features available for it as far as visual filters.

1730
02:08:00,599 --> 02:08:03,261
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a wood grain, a cell shaded...

1731
02:08:03,681 --> 02:08:07,282
[SPEAKER_07]: A Color Pencil, and then the normal version.

1732
02:08:07,722 --> 02:08:13,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, this, of course, has no involvement from Keita Takahashi.

1733
02:08:14,244 --> 02:08:21,467
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I got from watching the trailer is that you're actually going to be able to, well, roll up entire planets.

1734
02:08:22,667 --> 02:08:23,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And roll up the universe.

1735
02:08:25,428 --> 02:08:27,469
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of interesting.

1736
02:08:27,549 --> 02:08:29,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it rolling up, you know, the Earth.

1737
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:31,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty crazy.

1738
02:08:32,745 --> 02:08:33,305
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1739
02:08:57,777 --> 02:08:58,978
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

1740
02:09:30,722 --> 02:09:32,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm successful at life, thank you very much

1741
02:09:55,586 --> 02:10:17,314
[SPEAKER_09]: so yeah lots of interesting stuff going on including PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe is actually coming to the PSP you know we've been talking about a lot of different games coming to the PSP this might be the year of the PSP although last year was supposedly as well the year of the PSP as well

1742
02:10:18,373 --> 02:10:18,913
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1743
02:10:47,577 --> 02:10:48,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone loves their tower defense games.

1744
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:52,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, although they've kind of been jumping the shark as of late.

1745
02:10:52,723 --> 02:10:57,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it seems like they all have one, especially the Final Fantasy tower defense game, although it's kind of fun, I've got to say.

1746
02:10:58,230 --> 02:11:02,134
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, that's on every system and, you know, pixel junk and so on and so on.

1747
02:11:02,595 --> 02:11:04,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

1748
02:11:05,819 --> 02:11:08,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, obviously, swine flu has been all the rage this week.

1749
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe I'm reading this story.

1750
02:11:10,261 --> 02:11:12,182
[SPEAKER_10]: But swine flu has been all the rage this week.

1751
02:11:12,202 --> 02:11:17,484
[SPEAKER_10]: But did you know that swine flu has actually existed in the World of Warcraft for quite some time?

1752
02:11:18,244 --> 02:11:18,685
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1753
02:11:19,045 --> 02:11:24,027
[SPEAKER_10]: World of Warcraft has seen the swine flu for a little while now, ever since they released Wrath of the Lich King.

1754
02:11:24,527 --> 02:11:28,449
[SPEAKER_10]: It's these pigs in Borean Chandra, which is in the new area of Northrend.

1755
02:11:28,789 --> 02:11:29,149
[SPEAKER_10]: www.DarkSakura.com

1756
02:11:48,425 --> 02:11:53,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really Blizzard that has caused the swine flu.

1757
02:11:53,290 --> 02:11:55,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was Blizzard's fault all along.

1758
02:11:55,552 --> 02:11:58,955
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fact that I'm even talking about this story makes me cry inside a little bit.

1759
02:11:59,135 --> 02:12:03,138
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I get hurt by the stories that we read, that makes us very angsty.

1760
02:12:03,299 --> 02:12:04,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's when the FUs of the Week happen.

1761
02:12:20,765 --> 02:12:22,416
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your FUs of the week, please.

1762
02:12:22,825 --> 02:12:30,147
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU goes to Citrus Heights Cops, just in general, because they really like to find reasons to give you a ticket.

1763
02:12:30,247 --> 02:12:46,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I had one tailgating me, well, practically tailgating me on the way here, I guess waiting for me to speed or something, and thankfully someone decided to jaywalk right in front of us, so the cop turned on the sirens and got the jaywalker.

1764
02:12:46,831 --> 02:12:51,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Still, a bit, uh, I feel like they don't have enough to do or something, but anyway.

1765
02:12:52,881 --> 02:12:53,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki!

1766
02:12:55,042 --> 02:12:58,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, FU goes to, I guess, police as well.

1767
02:12:59,145 --> 02:12:59,906
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of funny, though.

1768
02:12:59,926 --> 02:13:05,669
[SPEAKER_09]: You see them turn on their sirens or whatever and see who pulls over to the side and they give them a ticket.

1769
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:07,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure why.

1770
02:13:07,611 --> 02:13:12,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Not necessarily people speeding, but people think that they want them to pull over and then they get a ticket for some reason.

1771
02:13:14,515 --> 02:13:17,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get tickets, though, because I can see them sitting there.

1772
02:13:19,819 --> 02:13:20,099
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1773
02:13:21,164 --> 02:13:23,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I the only one that doesn't have police issues this week?

1774
02:13:23,386 --> 02:13:29,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I didn't really have anything other than sitting in, you know, driving the Oakland sucks, so.

1775
02:13:30,612 --> 02:13:33,835
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to the fact that everything seems to close at like 10 o'clock in this city.

1776
02:13:35,109 --> 02:13:39,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I was out in Roseville last night trying to find some late night eats and everything was freaking closed.

1777
02:13:40,353 --> 02:13:42,594
[SPEAKER_10]: So F you to stores that close early.

1778
02:13:42,855 --> 02:13:43,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It's annoying.

1779
02:13:43,995 --> 02:13:45,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry, Loki.

1780
02:13:45,276 --> 02:13:47,158
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the finale of Heroes.

1781
02:13:47,198 --> 02:13:47,818
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucked.

1782
02:13:48,519 --> 02:13:52,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they did with the villain in the series is retarded.

1783
02:13:53,442 --> 02:13:53,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1784
02:13:54,563 --> 02:13:56,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm eight episodes behind on Heroes.

1785
02:13:56,144 --> 02:13:56,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of gave up.

1786
02:13:56,925 --> 02:13:57,345
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to...

1787
02:13:58,902 --> 02:13:59,162
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1788
02:14:27,202 --> 02:14:35,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is a teaser that was put out on the Pokemon Sunday TV show that's on TV, of course, in Japan.

1789
02:14:36,405 --> 02:14:40,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were saying that there would be a remake of Pokemon Gold and Silver.

1790
02:14:40,747 --> 02:14:47,609
[SPEAKER_07]: They said that they would have a world-exclusive first announcement on the 10th of May.

1791
02:14:48,189 --> 02:14:50,690
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that's it.

1792
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:52,091
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be a rumor.

1793
02:14:53,011 --> 02:14:59,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but they were showing, um, gold and silver confetti balls, so that could possibly be it.

1794
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:03,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to see their gold balls.

1795
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:07,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Wherever they can milk for money, they will.

1796
02:15:07,683 --> 02:15:08,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, Scorpion.

1797
02:15:11,929 --> 02:15:14,131
[SPEAKER_10]: www.justin.tv slash orange lounge radio

1798
02:15:37,287 --> 02:15:37,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Atsuku Atsuku Atsuku

1799
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:56,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Akatsuki Rising Akatsuki Rising Akatsuki Rising Akatsuki Rising

1800
02:16:15,891 --> 02:16:20,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yet another, is this related to all the other Naruto games in the world?

1801
02:16:20,355 --> 02:16:21,376
[SPEAKER_10]: God, there's so many of them.

1802
02:16:21,396 --> 02:16:26,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think this is going to be like the... Shippuden is basically what people are referring to as the time jump.

1803
02:16:27,340 --> 02:16:29,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, so he's a little bit older in this.

1804
02:16:29,602 --> 02:16:38,950
[SPEAKER_09]: But they've been doing the Shippuden games, like they did Ultimate Ninja 4, which is Shippuden, and then they have a new Shippuden game for the DS that's coming out.

1805
02:16:40,626 --> 02:16:41,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Next month, I think.

1806
02:16:41,848 --> 02:16:49,879
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this one's going to be another fighting game because they've been doing PSP Naruto Ultimate Ninja games like the Ultimate Ninja Heroes series.

1807
02:16:50,299 --> 02:16:53,624
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, you know, kind of going along with the whole shipping and stuff.

1808
02:16:53,644 --> 02:16:56,147
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, why not?

1809
02:16:56,247 --> 02:16:56,848
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks pretty good.

1810
02:16:58,371 --> 02:17:01,772
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, a couple more new games that are coming out in the future.

1811
02:17:02,472 --> 02:17:04,113
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to be coming out on the DS this winter.

1812
02:17:04,153 --> 02:17:11,816
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a fan of the Phoenix Wright series, which I guess you could really call the Ace Attorney series, there's a new game coming out called Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.

1813
02:17:12,416 --> 02:17:13,856
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to be like the other games.

1814
02:17:13,916 --> 02:17:17,678
[SPEAKER_10]: This is more about investigating the crime scene, not so much in the courtroom.

1815
02:17:17,698 --> 02:17:23,340
[SPEAKER_10]: You're actually going to become Miles Edgeworth, and you're going to investigate crime scenes, trying to find the truth.

1816
02:17:25,216 --> 02:17:26,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a weird CSI type thing.

1817
02:17:26,777 --> 02:17:27,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess.

1818
02:17:27,297 --> 02:17:30,578
[SPEAKER_10]: You're actually going to be on the crime scene as Edgeworth looking for contradictions.

1819
02:17:30,938 --> 02:17:35,620
[SPEAKER_10]: You identify clues and question material using logic and gathered evidence.

1820
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, there are several episodes in this game as well.

1821
02:17:38,461 --> 02:17:41,482
[SPEAKER_10]: The first one is a murder that happens in Edgeworth's office.

1822
02:17:42,083 --> 02:17:42,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1823
02:17:43,703 --> 02:17:47,805
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, this game is teen rated and it's supposed to have 15 hours worth of gameplay.

1824
02:17:48,979 --> 02:17:55,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure those of you that are fans of the Ace Attorney series will be happy about that, although the game is going in a little bit of a different direction this time.

1825
02:17:55,840 --> 02:17:56,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully not for the bad.

1826
02:17:58,069 --> 02:18:09,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of bad as in badass, Raven Software is actually wanting to make a particular game since they've been, and of course they were the ones that made the X-Men Origins Wolverine game.

1827
02:18:09,977 --> 02:18:11,077
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to do a Deadpool game.

1828
02:18:12,018 --> 02:18:13,839
[SPEAKER_07]: They really want to do a Deadpool game, it says.

1829
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:26,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, their project lead for the Wolverine game, Dan Vondrak, said that they really want to do it because of Deadpool's smartass attitude.

1830
02:18:26,667 --> 02:18:28,808
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they made one, I will buy it.

1831
02:18:29,828 --> 02:18:31,088
[SPEAKER_07]: On every platform.

1832
02:18:31,248 --> 02:18:31,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Just watch.

1833
02:18:32,068 --> 02:18:34,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Just on principle alone, even though it might suck?

1834
02:18:34,909 --> 02:18:40,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if the X-Men Origins game was pretty good, then I would expect them to give the Deadpool game a good treatment.

1835
02:18:40,891 --> 02:18:44,152
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey, I'm feeling good about that.

1836
02:18:44,632 --> 02:18:49,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, do we have any word yet on whether you will be able to break the fourth wall in this game?

1837
02:18:49,433 --> 02:18:50,013
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to.

1838
02:18:50,413 --> 02:18:52,334
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't be a Deadpool game if you don't break the fourth wall.

1839
02:18:54,141 --> 02:18:55,973
[SPEAKER_10]: There should be a button to smash the fourth wall.

1840
02:18:55,994 --> 02:18:57,443
[SPEAKER_07]: He should know he's in a video game.

1841
02:18:59,247 --> 02:19:01,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to be like Eat Lead?

1842
02:19:01,930 --> 02:19:02,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps.

1843
02:19:02,590 --> 02:19:02,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1844
02:19:03,992 --> 02:19:05,973
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the big thing about Deadpool.

1845
02:19:06,114 --> 02:19:06,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not know this.

1846
02:19:07,175 --> 02:19:13,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually read up on Deadpool after seeing the Wolverine movie to figure out why Jamie was so obsessed with Deadpool.

1847
02:19:13,421 --> 02:19:14,061
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it now.

1848
02:19:14,582 --> 02:19:16,503
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like a very Jamie thing from what I read.

1849
02:19:16,543 --> 02:19:19,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to just send you some images that you'll know.

1850
02:19:19,987 --> 02:19:21,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You saw the little yellow boxes?

1851
02:19:22,469 --> 02:19:24,251
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like ultimate right there.

1852
02:19:25,071 --> 02:19:29,795
[SPEAKER_07]: But by the way, the article that I'm reading actually did compare what they imagine as being like Eat Lead.

1853
02:19:31,276 --> 02:19:31,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1854
02:19:32,357 --> 02:19:33,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well guess what?

1855
02:19:33,338 --> 02:19:35,940
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that time of the show where we're going to take your phone calls.

1856
02:19:36,040 --> 02:19:37,201
[SPEAKER_10]: The phones are already ringing.

1857
02:19:37,241 --> 02:19:41,184
[SPEAKER_10]: A 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1858
02:19:41,224 --> 02:19:42,205
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go to the phones.

1859
02:19:42,265 --> 02:19:43,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1860
02:19:43,265 --> 02:19:43,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1861
02:19:44,386 --> 02:19:46,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's been a while since I've been on here.

1862
02:19:46,268 --> 02:19:47,188
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been a little while.

1863
02:19:47,268 --> 02:19:47,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Who is this?

1864
02:19:48,325 --> 02:19:50,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's DJ Ranma S from New York.

1865
02:19:50,746 --> 02:19:54,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Now see, I knew that, but I always make people introduce themselves for the sake of new listeners.

1866
02:19:54,887 --> 02:19:56,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what's on your mind, DJ Ranma S from New York?

1867
02:19:57,328 --> 02:19:57,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too much.

1868
02:19:57,888 --> 02:20:01,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple questions, but first, Loki, congratulations.

1869
02:20:03,170 --> 02:20:03,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1870
02:20:04,270 --> 02:20:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1871
02:20:05,251 --> 02:20:10,593
[SPEAKER_10]: You weren't able to get through last week when, of course, it was announced that Loki's looking at twins in the future.

1872
02:20:10,833 --> 02:20:11,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun, fun.

1873
02:20:12,373 --> 02:20:12,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1874
02:20:13,313 --> 02:20:13,714
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's up?

1875
02:20:15,594 --> 02:20:17,775
[SPEAKER_08]: My only qualm was about

1876
02:20:18,188 --> 02:20:20,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami cancelling Six Days in Fallujah.

1877
02:20:21,349 --> 02:20:22,790
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my only beef.

1878
02:20:23,810 --> 02:20:24,751
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your problem with it?

1879
02:20:25,991 --> 02:20:27,152
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the way I look at it.

1880
02:20:27,412 --> 02:20:38,737
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's okay to have various World War II simulating fighting games, I don't see how that's any different from Six Days in Fallujah or that's any different from the America's Army game.

1881
02:20:39,198 --> 02:20:42,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're all more or less based on real-time events.

1882
02:20:42,661 --> 02:20:43,702
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's too soon.

1883
02:20:44,123 --> 02:20:45,304
[SPEAKER_10]: People we know died there.

1884
02:20:45,364 --> 02:20:46,105
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too soon.

1885
02:20:46,725 --> 02:20:47,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too soon for this.

1886
02:20:48,127 --> 02:20:49,308
[SPEAKER_10]: The wounds are too fresh.

1887
02:20:49,888 --> 02:20:52,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I applied the Dennis Leary quote to this.

1888
02:20:53,172 --> 02:20:53,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut the fuck up!

1889
02:20:54,393 --> 02:20:55,414
[SPEAKER_07]: By Dr. Dennis Leary.

1890
02:20:56,693 --> 02:20:57,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

1891
02:20:57,153 --> 02:20:58,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just being devil's advocate here.

1892
02:20:58,354 --> 02:21:01,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't say I necessarily believe this, but what do you say to those people?

1893
02:21:01,737 --> 02:21:02,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Besides shut the fuck up.

1894
02:21:03,198 --> 02:21:09,462
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't say that to somebody who's, I guess maybe you can, but it's not a very nice thing to say.

1895
02:21:09,482 --> 02:21:11,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is there anything else to say besides?

1896
02:21:11,763 --> 02:21:12,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask this.

1897
02:21:12,224 --> 02:21:13,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Why should they shut the fuck up?

1898
02:21:15,326 --> 02:21:17,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Me personally, I'm just tired of hearing about it.

1899
02:21:17,307 --> 02:21:22,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you've got people who are over there fighting who are actually all for the game.

1900
02:21:22,050 --> 02:21:24,092
[SPEAKER_08]: They want their experiences in it, you know?

1901
02:21:24,693 --> 02:21:29,695
[SPEAKER_08]: They're over there doing what they have to do for us to do what we have to do here.

1902
02:21:31,756 --> 02:21:33,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that this is their game.

1903
02:21:33,456 --> 02:21:34,697
[SPEAKER_08]: They earned this.

1904
02:21:35,097 --> 02:21:35,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Let them have it.

1905
02:21:36,497 --> 02:21:38,958
[SPEAKER_07]: If people don't want to see it, then they just don't have to buy it.

1906
02:21:40,219 --> 02:21:40,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1907
02:21:41,479 --> 02:21:47,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it interesting that Konami might take more flack over not releasing this game than they would have if they had released it?

1908
02:21:49,682 --> 02:21:51,783
[SPEAKER_08]: One way or another, it'll be released, you know.

1909
02:21:52,242 --> 02:21:55,724
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, someone's going to release a beta for everyone to go play, you know.

1910
02:21:57,865 --> 02:21:58,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I guess that's true.

1911
02:21:58,765 --> 02:22:00,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it'll leak.

1912
02:22:01,066 --> 02:22:01,806
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll get pirated.

1913
02:22:02,326 --> 02:22:03,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that the inevitable?

1914
02:22:04,485 --> 02:22:05,285
[SPEAKER_08]: That's always the case.

1915
02:22:06,226 --> 02:22:07,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Ranma?

1916
02:22:08,787 --> 02:22:09,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too much.

1917
02:22:09,227 --> 02:22:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just glad that you guys got all the parts for the new studio PC.

1918
02:22:13,348 --> 02:22:14,069
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all here.

1919
02:22:14,169 --> 02:22:15,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, we haven't put it together yet.

1920
02:22:15,409 --> 02:22:16,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the timing hasn't worked out.

1921
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:20,971
[SPEAKER_10]: But Loki's going to do it during our break next week.

1922
02:22:21,151 --> 02:22:23,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So that when we come back, we'll be on an all-new computer.

1923
02:22:23,632 --> 02:22:27,734
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe we'll try to find some other new things to show off next week after a little break.

1924
02:22:28,594 --> 02:22:30,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Which we've been taking a lot of breaks this year.

1925
02:22:30,175 --> 02:22:30,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel bad.

1926
02:22:30,775 --> 02:22:31,375
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

1927
02:22:32,756 --> 02:22:33,136
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens.

1928
02:22:33,823 --> 02:22:35,025
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1929
02:22:51,987 --> 02:23:21,227
[SPEAKER_10]: um it's a possibility for later this year I really want to get back there but it's just because I promised ASEN I would do that sometime I'm doing that this year and that's going to be a chunk of money um and then you know I still really want to do PAX and E3 that's just going to set me back financially um I still really want to try and do New York in the fourth quarter and if things continue to go well for me in my day job and everything and I don't have any worries about the economy or anything like that um I'm hoping to do New York in the fourth quarter of the year like maybe October again

1930
02:23:22,025 --> 02:23:22,966
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be awesome.

1931
02:23:23,546 --> 02:23:28,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And on behalf of the New York Oil Army, we have one request if you make it out this way.

1932
02:23:29,972 --> 02:23:31,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Pack Jamie in the suitcase with you.

1933
02:23:32,717 --> 02:23:33,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll do what I can.

1934
02:23:34,537 --> 02:23:49,641
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had the money for it, I would be happy to, but as it is, I've had to already call off one trip that I was going to make at the end of this month, and having to put in extra massage time just to save up for a trip in two months, so I'm broke.

1935
02:23:50,061 --> 02:23:50,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm flat broke.

1936
02:23:50,821 --> 02:23:51,882
[SPEAKER_07]: School is wiping me out.

1937
02:23:52,062 --> 02:23:53,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what I feel.

1938
02:23:53,382 --> 02:23:53,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I should say this.

1939
02:23:54,002 --> 02:24:01,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, DarkSakura is not going to be doing E3 with us, which is unfortunate, but real life, greater than radio show, so...

1940
02:24:02,264 --> 02:24:03,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just trust me.

1941
02:24:03,686 --> 02:24:06,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wanted to come back out there this year.

1942
02:24:06,308 --> 02:24:07,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I really wanted to.

1943
02:24:08,129 --> 02:24:09,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll make it work somehow.

1944
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:17,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we'll have, you know, the economy set us back a little bit, but, you know, hopefully things will start to pick up and then 2010 we'll have lots of visits.

1945
02:24:17,776 --> 02:24:19,378
[SPEAKER_10]: You come here, I'll go there, we'll have a lot of fun.

1946
02:24:20,418 --> 02:24:22,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of like an exchange program.

1947
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:26,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll give in and I might even go to Atlanta for Bobby and go to a Friday Night Gaming show.

1948
02:24:27,064 --> 02:24:29,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I will be down in Atlanta this year, so.

1949
02:24:29,525 --> 02:24:30,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Will you really?

1950
02:24:30,306 --> 02:24:31,427
[SPEAKER_10]: For what, a convention or something?

1951
02:24:32,188 --> 02:24:35,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my company, we may be doing DragonCon this year.

1952
02:24:36,852 --> 02:24:37,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, nice.

1953
02:24:37,693 --> 02:24:42,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're going to be there for DragonCon, I doubt Bobby's going to be there with his Friday Night Gaming shindig.

1954
02:24:42,497 --> 02:24:45,860
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you happen to be there on a weekend and he's doing that, you should go say hi.

1955
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:49,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I know he likes to see the visitors out there.

1956
02:24:49,683 --> 02:24:52,045
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, the name of the town escapes me that they tape in.

1957
02:24:54,067 --> 02:24:54,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm bad.

1958
02:24:55,308 --> 02:24:55,528
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1959
02:24:55,848 --> 02:24:59,151
[SPEAKER_10]: The name of the town that Bobby tapes Friday Night Gaming in is not Atlanta.

1960
02:24:59,171 --> 02:24:59,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the suburbs.

1961
02:24:59,951 --> 02:25:00,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Alberta?

1962
02:25:00,728 --> 02:25:00,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Marietta?

1963
02:25:00,988 --> 02:25:01,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Marietta?

1964
02:25:30,772 --> 02:25:59,215
[SPEAKER_10]: and actually our internet went down in studio that's why we lost DJ Ranma is anybody online doing nobody's doing anything okay well right now it is trying to reconnect right now we went down um oh there we go woo Roswell is the town that they tape in I'm still on there we go fine I'm sorry I got it back but the the stream is down right now unfortunately so can we post that in chat that the stream is down but Skype is still open hold on all right

1965
02:26:02,185 --> 02:26:06,788
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, we unfortunately have that outage right now, but that's what happens sometimes with live radio.

1966
02:26:06,848 --> 02:26:07,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Things go down.

1967
02:26:07,669 --> 02:26:08,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, good.

1968
02:26:08,109 --> 02:26:08,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Streams back up.

1969
02:26:08,629 --> 02:26:08,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

1970
02:26:09,490 --> 02:26:09,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1971
02:26:11,251 --> 02:26:13,673
[SPEAKER_10]: 1877 GameOLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1972
02:26:13,713 --> 02:26:14,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us a call.

1973
02:26:14,273 --> 02:26:15,234
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take some calls.

1974
02:26:17,516 --> 02:26:19,197
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can't get through, keep trying.

1975
02:26:19,957 --> 02:26:25,081
[SPEAKER_10]: That little spurt of downtime we might have just had could have affected the calls.

1976
02:26:25,841 --> 02:26:26,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1977
02:26:26,402 --> 02:26:27,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're getting calls again.

1978
02:26:27,322 --> 02:26:28,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1979
02:26:28,563 --> 02:26:28,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1980
02:26:30,524 --> 02:26:31,005
[SPEAKER_02]: This is

1981
02:26:34,106 --> 02:26:35,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're breaking up there a little bit.

1982
02:26:35,426 --> 02:26:35,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Who is this?

1983
02:26:37,767 --> 02:26:38,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Spazinator.

1984
02:26:39,108 --> 02:26:39,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Spazinator.

1985
02:26:39,748 --> 02:26:40,268
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1986
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:49,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I did this earlier, but apparently I sent the email a little bit too late.

1987
02:26:49,592 --> 02:26:56,094
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less, I'm going to repeat a couple of questions.

1988
02:26:56,214 --> 02:27:02,497
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more or less directed towards you because you got your

1989
02:27:03,263 --> 02:27:13,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to point out, the connection's still really bad, but go ahead and ask your questions and we'll try to answer them.

1990
02:27:13,526 --> 02:27:16,287
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know if we can stay on, but keep going with your questions.

1991
02:27:18,228 --> 02:27:24,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically, what's your overall impression of PlayStation 3 this season?

1992
02:27:28,004 --> 02:27:29,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Overall impression of the PlayStation 3.

1993
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:32,656
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very similar to how I feel about the PSP.

1994
02:27:32,716 --> 02:27:33,498
[SPEAKER_10]: The PSP

1995
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:37,601
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1996
02:27:58,473 --> 02:28:25,009
[SPEAKER_10]: you know the internet browsing on it is better than it is on the Wii it has some cool little built in things for the CD music so it's kind of like it's not my favorite of the gaming systems I think my Xbox 360 is my favorite gaming system but I love the fact that it's quiet and I think that it's kind of I don't think it's a bad system at all I just wish they'd get some better exclusives but they do have some games I love like Little Big Planet and

1997
02:28:25,968 --> 02:28:49,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in terms of the multi-platform games out there, do you ever have a difficult time trying to pick and choose which system you're going to get the game for, especially if there's no real difference between, let's say, the 360 version and the PlayStation 3 version?

1998
02:28:49,044 --> 02:28:49,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1999
02:28:49,924 --> 02:28:51,525
[SPEAKER_10]: I have been in that situation before.

2000
02:28:51,805 --> 02:29:02,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Street Fighter 4 was the last time I had to make that decision because I pretty much swore up and down to myself I was going to get Street Fighter 4 on PlayStation 3 because PlayStation 3 had the better controller and I knew I'd be able to pull off the moves easier on the controller.

2001
02:29:03,092 --> 02:29:04,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, I wish Microsoft would fix that.

2002
02:29:04,833 --> 02:29:12,457
[SPEAKER_10]: As opposed to doing all this motion controller BS that they're starting, I really wish they would just fix the controller they've got and make that D-pad easier.

2003
02:29:12,517 --> 02:29:18,821
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyhow, I ended up getting it on the 360 because I thought Microsoft can fix their controller later on

2004
02:29:19,381 --> 02:29:22,243
[SPEAKER_10]: and just more people are on the 360 playing it.

2005
02:29:22,303 --> 02:29:27,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I can go on Xbox Live and there's way more people playing it whereas on my PlayStation 3 friends list there's not nearly as many people.

2006
02:29:27,585 --> 02:29:36,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, completely unrelated topic.

2007
02:29:36,450 --> 02:29:42,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally found something that's far, far worse than being rickrolled.

2008
02:29:42,333 --> 02:29:43,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh, what's that?

2009
02:29:45,997 --> 02:29:52,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of similar to be Rick Roll where someone sends you a link just saying it's one thing and it turns out to be something else.

2010
02:29:53,123 --> 02:29:55,845
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as it's not that two girls one cup crap.

2011
02:29:57,426 --> 02:30:00,189
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually there is a girl involved.

2012
02:30:01,270 --> 02:30:06,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you're kind of familiar with the story because it apparently occurred out your way.

2013
02:30:07,855 --> 02:30:10,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently some girl in California died like

2014
02:30:12,209 --> 02:30:19,992
[SPEAKER_02]: on Halloween Day two years ago, and some cop released the accident photos.

2015
02:30:20,012 --> 02:30:21,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone sent me a...

2016
02:30:40,459 --> 02:30:43,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, Spazinator, we gotta let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

2017
02:30:43,441 --> 02:30:44,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

2018
02:30:44,182 --> 02:30:44,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

2019
02:30:44,762 --> 02:30:47,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, and if you want to call, give us a call.

2020
02:30:47,704 --> 02:30:51,587
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2021
02:30:52,107 --> 02:30:56,890
[SPEAKER_10]: What's 1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2022
02:30:57,331 --> 02:30:59,892
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take a couple more calls here tonight and then we're going to wrap things up.

2023
02:30:59,932 --> 02:31:00,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2024
02:31:00,913 --> 02:31:01,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2025
02:31:02,554 --> 02:31:03,195
[SPEAKER_03]: DSMaster26.

2026
02:31:03,875 --> 02:31:05,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hello, DSMaster26.

2027
02:31:05,436 --> 02:31:06,157
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind tonight?

2028
02:31:07,938 --> 02:31:09,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much other than...

2029
02:31:10,174 --> 02:31:17,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the whole Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band debate, it's kind of rambling for me.

2030
02:31:18,037 --> 02:31:22,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, what the heck?

2031
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:29,783
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've heard my friends at the Hanna Club kind of rumor again and again at some point.

2032
02:31:31,463 --> 02:31:39,587
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably, knowing what, you know, how Konami teamed up with Disney a bunch of times to get, you know, the Disney DDRs and whatever.

2033
02:31:41,877 --> 02:31:49,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you saying that you're afraid this is going to go the route of the DDRs or that it's not such a bad thing because there's been so many DDRs with the Disney and all that stuff?

2034
02:31:50,962 --> 02:31:53,063
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, probably to expand our audience.

2035
02:31:53,163 --> 02:31:58,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess it could work, but I mean, the Wii was a family system to begin with.

2036
02:31:59,327 --> 02:32:10,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I'm thinking of just springing and getting a 360 anyways if I'm doing Guitar Hero stuff and using it for then and using the Wii for everything else.

2037
02:32:12,406 --> 02:32:15,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, I could see that being a little bit of a competition fence.

2038
02:32:15,167 --> 02:32:16,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but at the own... I think you're breaking up there.

2039
02:32:16,427 --> 02:32:16,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2040
02:32:16,648 --> 02:32:17,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2041
02:32:41,974 --> 02:32:45,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

2042
02:32:53,410 --> 02:32:53,990
[SPEAKER_10]: What can we say?

2043
02:32:54,191 --> 02:32:58,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, my internet's been crap all day at home, and I am with Comcast.

2044
02:32:59,294 --> 02:33:04,318
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been having issues here in the area, like when the rain started and all that stuff, so I don't know what the hell's going on.

2045
02:33:04,919 --> 02:33:06,200
[SPEAKER_10]: So I apologize to folks.

2046
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:07,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's try to get one more call.

2047
02:33:07,621 --> 02:33:08,521
[SPEAKER_10]: If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

2048
02:33:08,541 --> 02:33:11,924
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2049
02:33:11,964 --> 02:33:12,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead and give us a call.

2050
02:33:12,685 --> 02:33:16,648
[SPEAKER_10]: See, the chat room stopped again, and I'm wondering if that means do we crap out on... No?

2051
02:33:17,048 --> 02:33:17,928
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still broadcasting.

2052
02:33:20,070 --> 02:33:23,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to be on the safe side, since we're toward the end, I closed all my browsers.

2053
02:33:26,333 --> 02:33:31,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I pinged out a chat, so I don't think... Yeah, I'm not... So we can't see it.

2054
02:33:31,756 --> 02:33:33,737
[SPEAKER_10]: No, and the stream went down on top of all that.

2055
02:33:33,817 --> 02:33:36,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Boy, what a fun time we're having tonight.

2056
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody sure they're not downloading anything?

2057
02:33:40,501 --> 02:33:41,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Is my roommate...

2058
02:33:41,894 --> 02:33:42,535
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, I like pie

2059
02:34:03,329 --> 02:34:30,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultima Online is actually bringing out a new expansion, the Styganian Abyss, I guess, and apparently it will allow you to play as a new class, the Gargoyle class, and you'll also be able to explore the new Gargoyle home of Termur and the Styganian Abyss, I guess, dungeon, which is the largest dungeon area ever introduced into Ultima Online.

2060
02:34:31,598 --> 02:34:32,198
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

2061
02:34:32,739 --> 02:34:36,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe that Ultima Online is still alive and kicking after all these years.

2062
02:34:37,001 --> 02:34:38,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty impressive in itself.

2063
02:34:38,903 --> 02:34:39,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2064
02:34:39,403 --> 02:34:39,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

2065
02:34:40,043 --> 02:34:40,324
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2066
02:34:40,924 --> 02:34:42,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hello, caller.

2067
02:34:42,205 --> 02:34:43,025
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on the air.

2068
02:34:43,566 --> 02:34:44,927
[SPEAKER_10]: You're supposed to wait for me to acknowledge you.

2069
02:34:45,747 --> 02:34:46,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Zaku.

2070
02:34:46,368 --> 02:34:49,029
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy, while we're having crappy internet problems tonight?

2071
02:34:50,050 --> 02:34:50,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much.

2072
02:34:50,730 --> 02:34:57,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Just praying that the street doesn't go down again and just enjoying the fact that me and my bro have the house to ourselves because mom's on vacation in Peru.

2073
02:34:59,389 --> 02:35:00,470
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's on your mind?

2074
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:01,811
[SPEAKER_10]: What possessed you to call in tonight?

2075
02:35:01,831 --> 02:35:04,053
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just bragging that you have the house all to yourself.

2076
02:35:09,478 --> 02:35:09,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2077
02:35:10,259 --> 02:35:10,839
[SPEAKER_10]: God damn it.

2078
02:35:10,939 --> 02:35:11,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, are you there?

2079
02:35:13,602 --> 02:35:14,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Caller, are you there?

2080
02:35:16,184 --> 02:35:17,005
[SPEAKER_10]: We lost another one.

2081
02:35:18,226 --> 02:35:20,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we're going to turn off Justin TV and hope that that'll help things.

2082
02:35:21,469 --> 02:35:22,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So, boy oh boy.

2083
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:26,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2084
02:35:28,695 --> 02:35:30,095
[SPEAKER_10]: What a dumpy end to the show.

2085
02:35:30,175 --> 02:35:31,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, that happens sometimes, guys.

2086
02:35:34,217 --> 02:35:39,360
[SPEAKER_10]: If Zaku can get his question out in chat, we'll try to answer it, guys.

2087
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:43,762
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to get your questions out in chat, we'll try to answer them while Loki gets some last-minute stories out of the way.

2088
02:35:47,703 --> 02:35:53,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. T and Will Wright are teaming up against Nazis in a new Zootfly game.

2089
02:35:53,525 --> 02:35:58,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Zootfly, if you remember, is the company originally they were pitching the Ghostbusters game.

2090
02:35:59,106 --> 02:36:01,327
[SPEAKER_09]: They've also done some other stuff beyond that.

2091
02:36:02,307 --> 02:36:04,647
[SPEAKER_09]: But now they're making a Mr. T game.

2092
02:36:04,667 --> 02:36:05,548
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2093
02:36:07,108 --> 02:36:08,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, he will take on Nazis.

2094
02:36:09,189 --> 02:36:10,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you tell people to get nuts?

2095
02:36:10,849 --> 02:36:24,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It says apparently the first game will see Mr. T take on Nazis and their gigantic machines in a varied universe of South American rainforests, lost ancient cities, industrial complexes, and contemporary military installations.

2096
02:36:25,012 --> 02:36:30,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with Mr. T and other characters from the graphic novel, the game will feature none other than Will Wright.

2097
02:36:31,547 --> 02:36:49,703
[SPEAKER_09]: In this universe, Will Wright is a top-notch game designer, but also, but a top-notch, I guess he's not a top-notch game designer, but a top-notch American geneticist who was kidnapped and coerced to work on a diabolic plan, and Mr. T and Will Wright will join forces to annihilate the Nazis and their hardware.

2098
02:36:50,043 --> 02:36:52,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was smoking crack when they thought of this?

2099
02:36:53,466 --> 02:36:54,327
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an awesome game.

2100
02:36:54,387 --> 02:36:57,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you anything they saw the Snickers commercials with Mr. T.

2101
02:36:57,975 --> 02:36:58,556
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

2102
02:37:15,571 --> 02:37:18,552
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, we're just trying to finish up the show at this point.

2103
02:37:18,592 --> 02:37:21,493
[SPEAKER_10]: We just turned off Skype because the calls just aren't cooperating tonight.

2104
02:37:22,013 --> 02:37:23,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what's going on, guys.

2105
02:37:23,773 --> 02:37:25,614
[SPEAKER_10]: All of our configurations are fine on our end.

2106
02:37:25,634 --> 02:37:26,814
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no cable problems.

2107
02:37:26,894 --> 02:37:27,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing's falling apart.

2108
02:37:28,494 --> 02:37:29,595
[SPEAKER_10]: No video card issues.

2109
02:37:29,755 --> 02:37:31,235
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something on the Comcast.

2110
02:37:31,455 --> 02:37:38,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was an update to Noby Noby Boy, which apparently added the 4-boy offline multiplayer mix.

2111
02:37:38,177 --> 02:37:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, there's a new boy that you get to play as, Fart Boy.

2112
02:37:42,198 --> 02:37:42,658
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2113
02:37:43,378 --> 02:37:45,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Fartboy.

2114
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:46,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that his given name?

2115
02:37:46,581 --> 02:37:48,923
[SPEAKER_09]: That is his given name, Fartboy.

2116
02:37:49,284 --> 02:37:51,285
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as, I guess, the lower key updates.

2117
02:37:51,426 --> 02:37:58,592
[SPEAKER_09]: They have variations to the boys' house hairstyles and new poses to the game's bird.

2118
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:02,832
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

2119
02:38:03,473 --> 02:38:07,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we were talking a little bit about the rumors of the PSP Go.

2120
02:38:07,497 --> 02:38:11,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's a new game coming from Capcom, Fate Unlimited.

2121
02:38:13,523 --> 02:38:15,866
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to put that actually on...

2122
02:38:17,659 --> 02:38:19,160
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be download-only in Europe.

2123
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:23,663
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently Capcom is releasing on the UMD elsewhere.

2124
02:38:23,883 --> 02:38:30,628
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're kind of testing that whole thing to see if people actually buy the download-content-only games.

2125
02:38:31,448 --> 02:38:32,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2126
02:38:32,709 --> 02:38:34,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it is a sign of things to come.

2127
02:38:34,390 --> 02:38:37,192
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think is going to happen if the answer is no, they don't?

2128
02:38:38,601 --> 02:38:42,224
[SPEAKER_10]: and they've invested all this in this PSP Go thing.

2129
02:38:42,584 --> 02:38:49,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I heard the rumor about the PSP Go is that the design is not finalized yet and so they could add the UMD drive if necessary.

2130
02:38:50,209 --> 02:38:52,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be a good idea if they were...

2131
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:53,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Marvel vs. Capcom 2

2132
02:39:09,838 --> 02:39:37,767
[SPEAKER_09]: and then also they had a PS3 demo that came out this week actually so if you want to check that out you can and of course that was that countdown that they had going they're going to have apparently all 56 characters will be unlocked from the beginning and they're going to also feature I guess some HD upscaling as well as widescreen options and custom soundtracks on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 and

2133
02:39:38,987 --> 02:39:43,031
[SPEAKER_09]: and they also have three different screen modes that you can do.

2134
02:39:43,051 --> 02:39:51,438
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do just the classic, you know, kind of pixelated look and then they have a smooth and a crisp look that you can do.

2135
02:39:54,888 --> 02:40:10,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And finally, I just want to say for the live listeners, while the stream is up, I have double-checked everything in the house, including what's going on with my roommate and everything, and we don't know what's going on with the stream right now, so we're just going to try and limp our way through the end of the show at this point.

2136
02:40:11,297 --> 02:40:11,837
[SPEAKER_10]: We're almost there.

2137
02:40:12,297 --> 02:40:13,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

2138
02:40:13,798 --> 02:40:19,301
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a picture of the homebrew enabler on the PSP-3000 working, so...

2139
02:40:20,962 --> 02:40:24,424
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only a matter of time before the custom firmware is on the PSP 3000.

2140
02:40:26,145 --> 02:40:27,085
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting.

2141
02:40:27,845 --> 02:40:32,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, we were talking a little bit about Wolverine Origins, the video game.

2142
02:40:32,348 --> 02:40:45,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, since Activision is fun like that and Blizzard likes doing all sorts of crazy stuff, they've hidden a lot of little Easter eggs in the game, including references to Portal.

2143
02:40:45,414 --> 02:40:48,936
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a surprise cake that you can get that unlocks an achievement.

2144
02:40:49,503 --> 02:40:58,847
[SPEAKER_09]: and also they even have the Frostmour from World of Warcraft as well in there that you can get an achievement that's entitled Wow.

2145
02:41:01,208 --> 02:41:01,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2146
02:41:03,508 --> 02:41:03,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing.

2147
02:41:04,029 --> 02:41:05,369
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of little hidden goodies.

2148
02:41:06,450 --> 02:41:10,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well we're going to go around and wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts.

2149
02:41:11,091 --> 02:41:12,612
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2150
02:41:14,273 --> 02:41:17,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I want animal style fries and a milkshake.

2151
02:41:19,801 --> 02:41:23,390
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I hate internet problems that you can't explain.

2152
02:41:24,434 --> 02:41:26,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

2153
02:41:54,073 --> 02:41:54,373
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2154
02:41:55,993 --> 02:41:56,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2155
02:41:56,994 --> 02:42:05,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and downloading and especially the live listeners who stuck with us through the ups and downs of the connections tonight.

2156
02:42:06,095 --> 02:42:06,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't know what's going on.

2157
02:42:06,936 --> 02:42:08,276
[SPEAKER_10]: The internet's crazy like that sometimes.

2158
02:42:08,616 --> 02:42:13,497
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you guys for staying with us, especially those of you on the podcast for downloading and supporting Independent Radio.
