WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Skye, and Moku!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, May 3rd, 2009, will we see multiple motion controllers in this year's E3?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Are the Ninja Turtles being remade for a new downloadable game?

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And a new video game will let you show off your ironing skills!

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
I'm with you here every week. Rob Roberts also joining you tonight.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Always here with us as usual. How you doing?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm recovering.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Recovering? Are you an alcoholic?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
No.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Sorry to hear it.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
From the week from hell.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I'm sorry to hear about the week from hell.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Was there a lot of gaming to be done in the week from hell?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Some, actually. A little.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
Alright, we'll get to that in just a moment, but we can't start the show without introducing the one and only tech master, Loki!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Hello.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
How you doing?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Good.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
And I see your normal Sunday ration of fast food.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
You have some Burger King tonight.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Yes.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Sticking with the traditionals.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
I was going to get McDonald's, but I had somehow was in a daze and drove past it and went to Burger King instead.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
How exactly do you select what your fast grub is going to be before the show before you get here?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
What I feel like.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Just what you feel like?

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
What you going to stop at on the way?

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
I was driving home from Oakland right before the show, so I wouldn't have been able to stop somewhere healthy because it takes a lot longer.

01:44.000 --> 01:57.000
And unfortunately fast food didn't take quite as, it wasn't as fast as I had hoped because an idiot in front of me decided to use a coupon for their fast food order and the coupon didn't apply to what they had ordered.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
So he sat there arguing with them for a good 10 minutes and that sucked.

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
Misty in our chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com starts us off tonight wanting to know, but the question is what kind of BK noms?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Double bacon cheeseburger.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, very healthy.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Exactly. It's very delicious.

02:17.000 --> 02:29.000
All right, and Black Wolf, the gentleman before us here on Sunday nights when we tape live on all games radio at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, Black Wolf is in chat and says, hey, I heard this was a show about video games.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Once in a while, once in a while we do talk about video games. In fact, let's get to it.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
We always like to start off a little bit of how is your gaming week?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
There's no guests tonight, just you guys in the chat room.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Chat.orangelaundry.com. We'll start off tonight with Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
I played Cooking Mama on iPhone while waiting for Wolverine to start.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
The rest of it was spent on homework. All week homework. The end.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
What do you think about the fact that they play those ads before movies? Like, you know, while they have a captive audience, they're showing previews for TV shows and all this garbage.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I was ignoring them.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
You think it's smart or you think it's annoying? It cuts into your Cooking Mama time.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
It's annoying, but it is smart marketing. So, I try not to think of it one way or another.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
The bottom line is all that matters to the companies. So, of course, they're going to try to get the word out there in every front possible that's just marketing.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
So, I'm really, I guess, indifferent towards the whole thing. Yeah, I may not care about what is that show with what's-her-face.

03:30.000 --> 03:40.000
Keira Sedgwick. But the only good thing I saw her in was singles anyway. But I just, I'm totally indifferent.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
It's marketing. It's the world we live in today. If people don't like it, go to the bathroom. Take that as your pee break.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
Since, you know, even though we are a video game show, we get into nerdy topics. And I know you have a love for the X-Men.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
So, I'm sure this was an important movie for you. What did you think of the X-Men movie?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
I liked the first 15 minutes of it.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
That part was great because it was all about Wade not shutting up without spoiling anything.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Now, the listeners should know you're a total Deadpool fan girl.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I am a total Deadpool fan girl.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
So, this was very important, the treatment that he received in the movie. Yes, I'm very, I'm sure you love the end.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Depending on which ending.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
The actual end and not the end after the end.

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
The bonus end, okay, if you watch off to the credits, there's one of two endings. And I got the more lame one.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And I got to see the other one on YouTube before it got pulled off.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
And I wish I'd had that one because it made me a lot happier and had some fourth wall breakage.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
We don't want to give spoilers, though.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm not saying anything.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
I know. They're just doing that so they can whore that character out for another horrible movie.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
That's more warning Loki than you.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
No, because they are, I've been reading several interviews and articles where they're leaving it open for a Deadpool movie.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Which would make me happy if they do it freakin' right.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Question from chat, and a comment from chat. I like old people in chat, which by the way, I still love that name.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
It says, X-Men applies to games because there is a game of it.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Actually, there's been several games about the X-Men.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
I remember an old school one on the PC, like back in the early 90s, where you were trying to rescue Storm.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
I don't even remember what the game, I think it was just X-Men or whatever.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
But yeah, X-Men and games have always been kind of tied together a little bit. There's always those tie-ins.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
But, um, DJ Rama S asks, how well did Ryan Reynolds play Deadpool?

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Keep in mind, he wasn't playing Deadpool in the beginning of the movie. He was playing Wade.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
And he, I thought that was pretty, pretty darn right.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Because he did not shut up.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
And it was perfect.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I was totally, totally down with that.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I thought that he did an excellent performance on top of that.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Even if you watch any of the interviews with him, he's totally a fan, so it was pretty cool.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I thought he was pretty good too.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
And yes, I actually saw the Wolverine movie.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
I hardly ever go to movies the weekend they open, but it worked out that I went this weekend and had a good time.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
So, I enjoyed the movie more than the last X-Men movie they had.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The last X-Men movie was crap.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
It was pure and utter ass.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
It wasn't even ass, it was sphincter.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
They also had a good amount of fanboy wank in the movie, which I enjoyed.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
They threw the fanboys some bones, like having Emma Frost in it, you know.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
But she's not really, I don't want to spoil it, God.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I know, I know, I know.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
But they tipped the hat.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
They had nothing to do with each other, you know what I'm talking about.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I know, I know.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
They tipped the hat, is what I'm saying.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
And then Gambit, I mean, hello, I was a little worried about how they were going to portray Gambit.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
But, you know, he showed up and was like, hi, I'm Gambit, I'm going to be awesome now.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
What I was actually most pleased with about him is that they actually got, his accent is legitimate.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
It's not one of those overdone, fake Cajun accents.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
It sounds pretty right for the area, so I was pretty pleased with that.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
ActDeaf is in our chat room and says, I couldn't see the movie since theaters are closed in Mexico.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Because he lives in Mexico and you know how, you know, swine flu is all the rage down there.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
As it is starting to be up here too.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
They're closing all the movie theaters.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
Ray Iannami said sign flu and I'm certainly thinking cosign flu next.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Alright, let's get into more video games.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Loki, did you play anything this week?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Yes, I did.

07:16.000 --> 07:25.000
I played some DS stuff while I was sitting in an apartment with my wife's grandparents who don't speak English.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And there's everyone yelling back and forth in Russian.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
And on TV they had a telenovela, which was in Spanish, but dubbed over in Russian.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
So it was like double not understanding anything.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
So it was awesome.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
I like that double not understanding anything.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Zero plus zero equals zero.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Exactly.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
But if you're a fan of like the soup and stuff, you may remember how they, I forget which soap opera it is,

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
but the guy that yells, Rick! I kept doing that because there was a guy that kept talking and that was funny.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Keep me entertained.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Anyways, actual games. I played more of the great Giana Sisters DS game.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
How is that? I need to check that out.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
It's a basic DS game.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
It's just, you know, very much a rip off of Super Mario Brothers.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
But that's what made the old school one on the Commodore 64 so awesome was that it was such a rip off of Mario Brothers.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
How's the music?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I love the soundtrack to the Giana Sisters.

08:23.000 --> 08:33.000
It's okay. It's not, I mean, I didn't notice any old remakes or whatever, but maybe there were, I mean, I never really played the original.

08:33.000 --> 08:42.000
But it's funny though, I like how she gets the red orb or whatever and becomes emo Giana or whatever and just starts throwing fire that way.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
It's like, oh look, I went to Hot Topic. Now I'm going to kick ass.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
So that was okay.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
I played a little bit more Rhythm Heaven but I still can't stand that game because it's not forgiving at all.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
I mean, just, I'm trying to get gold on stuff and it's just not even worth it.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
And there's another, like the second set of puzzles that I have that can't do it at all.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
So I gave up on that.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
I tried Gardening Mama and wow, that game sucks really bad.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Why? What's terrible about it?

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
I don't know. It's just not the same as Cooking Mama. It doesn't have that same charm to it.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Does it feel like a copy of a copy?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
It feels like a copy of a copy and it's also confusing.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
They don't really tell you what you're supposed to be doing a lot of times.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm like, it's not like, you know, where it's like chop and you kind of get what you're supposed to do.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
This I couldn't figure it out so it was annoying.

09:34.000 --> 09:45.000
And then I played a lot more Grand Theft Auto 4 and more on my PC because I'm trying to, my plan is I'm going to mod the rest of our systems.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
And we're going to create custom weapons so we can play against each other.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And so I'm trying to develop what weapons they are.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm trying to make a flamethrower and I kind of got one sort of made out of like a sniper rifle and some like fire effect thing.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
And it works pretty good except sometimes you can catch yourself on fire which is kind of annoying.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Well now that's no fun.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
And then another one like a hurricane bomb or something where you throw it down and it just throws everything around but it can kill yourself also pretty violently sometimes.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
So just kind of messing with that.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
And then what else?

10:18.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh I tried playing Bionic Commando but the problem is at our work our internet's like, even though we're on a T1, it's like split 200 ways and it's slow as hell and I couldn't connect any games.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
So that was very disappointing and fortunately this weekend being so busy I didn't get a chance to actually play that.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
But I do want to play that because that game looks awesome.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
So yeah that's pretty much it for this week.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
And I think I may have played a little bit more Excitebots somewhere in there because I finally unlocked the Super Excite.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
So I'm actually going to be playing through that tonight which apparently is very unforgiving.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Even more so than the first game.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah and Excitebots is here in studio tonight. So the wife finally let it go for her.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
She gave up on it actually.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Oh my gosh really?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah she said it was too hard.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
By the way if you've never listened to the show before, something you should know about Loki's wife, she really doesn't play a lot of games.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
But there will be that occasional game she gets obsessed with and Excitebots is one of them.

11:16.000 --> 11:29.000
Excitetruck was really the one that she was really looking forward to and she still had fun with it but she's gotten to a kind of a wall right now where she can't S rank these Super Excite ones.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
And I mean it's really hard. You have to get even more points than you did in the first time.

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
And the first time in just a normal Excite race, I mean getting S sometimes requires you to play a track like 20 times if not more than that.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.000
And now you have to get even more than what you got before. It's just like you want to pull your hair out.

11:48.000 --> 11:56.000
And then you get mirror mode which is even harder. And that's always fun. But you unlock more bots.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I saw the hand.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Yes there's a hand that tries to smack you for some reason.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
It's the Smash Brothers hand.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
I guess it's Master Hand but it's a hand that tries to smash you. I don't know. For no apparent reason whatsoever.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
I do kind of want to check this game out. I know we don't have any guests to play it on Justin TV tonight.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
But hopefully we'll have in between stories and be able to play some.

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
I also played a 101 in 1 retro game. I forget what it's called. It's an Atlas collection of mini games.

12:26.000 --> 12:33.000
That sucked too. Because apparently you start off with like 10 games and you have to play through all of them.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
And they don't control very well. And you have to score so many points before you can unlock another game.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
And I can't because it doesn't control very well and it's annoying.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Dope.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
That's alright.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Alright.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
That's it.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Well let's see my game.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
But I did want to mention something else we played. Which I don't remember exactly the title of the game.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
I thought it was something like, was it Eat Poop Cat or something like that?

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh yeah. The one I eat. Yeah. I remember. It had a very weird name.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Eat Something Cat Poop or something like that was the name of the game.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
And basically it's kind of like a drawing version of Telephone. And it was awesome.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And isn't it just like the game LoL on the Nintendo DS?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah. That's what it is. Yeah. Basically.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
And just to explain this, guys. So you don't think we're crazy with the title or whatever.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
It's basically a game where you write a caption, then you pass the paper to the left, and somebody draws a picture of the caption.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Then you fold the piece of paper over so the caption is hidden.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
And then you pass it again. The next person writes the caption they think goes with the picture.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Then they fold over the picture. And the next person draws a picture to go with the caption.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
And so on and so on. I know it sounds stupid as I'm describing it, but it's actually a lot of fun.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Because there's always someone in the group who will turn everything into penis.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
No matter, you know, what you do.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
That person was Rice Princess.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Yes. Truth.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Alright. Anyhow.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Other games. Let's see. My gaming week. Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
I still had the old standby old stuff.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Especially a lot of classic gaming on the Nintendo Wii this week.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
Going into my archive of Zelda and Kid Icarus and all the old school stuff.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Not a lot of new stuff for me this week.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I don't think there's been a lot of new stuff that's been out recently that's kind of caught my attention.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
So I am excited though about some of the Xbox Live Arcade releases coming up at least this coming week.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
That I'm hoping to try out before I head off this weekend to Anime Central.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
So speaking of which.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I wanted to talk about and give a little reminder.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
I am going to be at Anime Central this weekend in Chicago.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I have a panel on Friday it's called So You Think You Can Podcast.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
So if you ever want to hear more about how OLR got started or kind of the story behind it.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Or you want to start your own podcast and you're kind of curious where do I begin?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
What kind of mics do I need?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
How do I get a listener base or what have you?

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
I'm going to be doing that panel 4.30 on Friday and I believe it's panel room 7.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
But I'm doing that off the top of my head.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Please check the program for the specific location.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I know it's one of the smaller rooms because they're not anticipating there's going to be a big crowd for that.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
So let's prove them wrong and make it standing room only.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Also I want to give another thank you to the listeners for the wonderful show computer.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Sadly we're not broadcasting off that tonight.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
But I think when we come back in two weeks we're going to be on that show computer.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
The new one right?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So we haven't got a chance to actually put it together.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Yeah it just hasn't worked out.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
And by the way since of ASEN next week I do not believe there's going to be a show next week.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
So next week we will be off.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.000
Unfortunately I don't get back from Chicago until actually it's funny I get back at like 7 o'clock.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
So I'm just going to miss you know and that's hoping there's no delays or anything like that.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
So sadly we will not be here next week.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
But Bobby of course will be here as always.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
So give his show a listen.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
He'll probably run a little long next week to compensate.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah Bobby was saying that he played Polls Big Adventure on WiiWare.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Which I've been meaning to actually play or install.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
But I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
But that's a pretty awesome game.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
That's the one that kind of rips off of all these different old school games.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
They have like the castle from Mario Brothers and stuff in it and like weird stuff.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.000
By the way the other good news though about having the show computer is that once we have that that computer will be able to travel.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
So that way when I'm gone in the future we'll not hopefully still be able to have a show just without me.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Sniff.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
But you know it happens.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
We all have our real lives and so on.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Let's see.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Marissa by the way is in chat is jealous of me because I get to visit with the show's resident lesbians at ASEN.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yes this is true.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
I'm hoping to see the lesbians while I'm out there.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Apparently they hang out in the art room 24-7 is what I hear.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
So I'm going to definitely stop by there.

16:43.000 --> 16:51.000
And I'm hoping I'm going to take my video camera because our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel is severely neglected.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
I think the last time we updated it was like two years ago.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Well what a perfect opportunity this will be to get some stuff for the YouTube channel.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
Because for a personal thing I do I've been using YouTube a lot more recently for like a non-gaming thing.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
So I've learned how to like edit video a lot better and do that stuff.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
So I'm excited to go to ASEN and actually shoot some video.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
So I hope our listeners aren't camera shy.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Because I will be in your face with a camera.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
And if so too bad.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yes too bad.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Alright so I'm excited.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Okay that's really it for housekeeping tonight.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Let's get into some video game news.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
We have a lot of rumors tonight.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Rumors, rumors, rumors.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
But aren't rumors fun to talk about and we're going to see if they seem real or not to us.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
And I think Loki's going to start us off tonight.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Yes one rumor that we have came from Engadget.

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
Apparently they have somebody that has captured what they I guess supposedly believe.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
That is a brand new peripheral from Microsoft for the Xbox 360.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
Kind of looks like a stretched out webcam or cross between a webcam and the Wii sensor bar.

17:53.000 --> 18:02.000
Basically what this device is supposed to be doing is it's actually a motion sensing kind of almost like a camera.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
It will actually be used to pick up full body movement and sound.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
And apparently you can use this to capture full body and hand gestures.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Controlling games and characters.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Fighting games you can punch, kick, dive, jump, whatever.

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
You can also manipulate stuff on the screen by picking it up, pinching it, moving it, that kind of stuff.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Video conferencing.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
They were saying that you can use it in a trivia game over the internet with live images of each person playing.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
And the buzzing you would clap.

18:35.000 --> 18:42.000
Some other stuff including sensor detects when the person is playing.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Only the person that's playing the game and not the people that are just watching it.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
But I do believe they showed this off the company behind it during CES this year.

18:53.000 --> 19:02.000
And it looked interesting. It's basically, I don't know, they were using it actually just a normal webcam.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
And they had a boxing game and they were showing some guy doing that.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
It almost looked like an iToy boxing game because you could see the guy in the background and stuff.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
They have like a flight sim game and stuff.

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
So basically the same kind of applications you would use like an iToy for this would be used for.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
But the iToy sucked.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
Yes, but technology is getting better. Just like the PlayStation Eye is a lot better than the original iToy.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Okay, first off, real or bullshit? What do you think?

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
There's an image of it. I would say it's real and this is something that they've already...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Oh come on, we live in a day and age of Photoshop.

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
Okay, but they've already teased that, oh we're going to show something off of E3 that's going to revolutionize the way you play games.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Or the way you enjoy entertainment.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Uh, hello?

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
I was just being devil's advocate. I think it's totally real too because Microsoft rumors are always true.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I mean that's the rule of thumb we've learned over the years.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
There's very rarely been rumors about Microsoft that aren't true.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
And they're horrible at keeping E3 secrets as we learned last year.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Dark Sakura, real or bullshit?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah, I'd do it for real.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Here's the thing though, even though it's real, it's not that new.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.000
We already have a camera on the Xbox 360 and when I hear about this I shudder because I think of Totem Ball.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Which is that horrible, horrible video camera game they had that they tried to do the full body motion controls with.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Come on. I mean, granted technology has gotten a little better but come on, that game was shit.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
I agree. I agree with you and this technology, they actually bought a company.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
You know, Microsoft bought a company specifically that made these motion type controls.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
And I hear that guy, I forget his name, I don't want to say Bobby Lee but I don't think it's Bobby Lee.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
It's something Lee.

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
Remember the guy who did all those wonderful Wiimote things with the stereoscopic or the head tracking and that kind of stuff?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
The one who did all those experiments?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Oh yeah, the demos and stuff.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, he works for Microsoft now.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
That is such a Microsoft thing to happen to.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Yes.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
So funny.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
So I would not be surprised if this is at E3.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
This makes sense because, I mean, and we're going to get into a little bit more later on with other things.

21:06.000 --> 21:12.000
But if you think about it, these companies now are starting to take away what is unique about the Wii.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
And when you take away the motion sensing from the Wii, what's left?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
A GameCube.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Nintendo franchises.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says, if at first you don't succeed, buy a company that does it better.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
Chat.orangelandrader.com if you want to join us in our chat room.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Here's the other thing about it.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Video conferencing, not new.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
We already have that on the Xbox 360 with the camera.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
It's just that nobody bought the camera.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Except people who wanted to play Strip Uno.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
That's the only reason people bought the camera.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Remember that game Year in the Movies?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Dropped down 20 bucks.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Oh yeah, I forgot about that game.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
So it's 20 bucks with the camera bundled in.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
That's actually cheaper than buying the camera by itself.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Do you think it's because they're unloading the cameras because they're not going to need them anymore?

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Probably.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
And, you know, this, I'm assuming it's going to be more than just a single camera.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Because obviously that didn't work before.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And they have new technology now.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
We've even seen it before in past E3s. I can remember way back to E3 2005.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
They were showing off camera technology that was actually put in bounding boxes around people's heads.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.000
It was able to track individual people and was able to differentiate who's playing the game and who's not.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
So, I wouldn't be surprised if we see this.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Comments in the chat room.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Deathwishing says, I bought the camera for Rainbow Six Vegas.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
Yeah, you know, there were a lot of little games that would use the camera.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
You know, like UNO had it and some of the other online Xbox Live games.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
And then some of the other games, like Burnout Paradise.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
You could take your driver's license picture with the camera.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Ooh-ah.

22:44.000 --> 22:52.000
Well, every time you knock someone into a wall, you can do a little bit like, yeah, bitch.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Stuff like that. Little silly things like that.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
Or making your own icon, which before we had the official OLR icon on Xbox Live Marketplace,

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
you could kind of make a ghetto one with the Xbox Live camera.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
In fact, I think Bobby did that for a long time before he had his show's logo on Xbox Live Marketplace.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
I think he somehow took a picture with his camera.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
I could be getting that confused with the little big planet level, though.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
Anyway, I also want to say some other comments from chat here.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
Black Wolf, of all people, actually says, you're in the movies, doesn't work too well, sadly.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
I can't get the right lighting.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
That's always a pain in the ass with these camera setups, too, is the lighting.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
If it's not just right, the game works terribly.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Like, I had a couple of those iToy games on PlayStation 2, and they work like crap.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
You know what I mean? Like, you have to have the exact right lighting.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Well, I'm hoping that this stuff that comes out for whatever this camera or peripheral is going to be,

23:45.000 --> 23:51.000
it's hopefully going to be a little bit better than the current camera out there.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
You know, I've been a sucker.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
I've bought all three cameras, both the PlayStation iToy and the Vision camera and the PlayStation Eye.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Granted, I haven't really used the PlayStation Eye.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
I meant to use it when I was going to make all these little big planet levels, which I never did.

24:08.000 --> 24:16.000
And, you know, the iToy or the Vision camera was... I don't even remember what the hell I bought the Vision camera for.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Just the habit, I think.

24:18.000 --> 24:27.000
And, man, I can tell you at least with... I haven't tried the PlayStation Eye too much, but the other two, disappointment.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Except we did get a good webcam out of the iToy Play.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Back in the day.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
So that kind of worked out.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Remember when iToy Chat was going to be the next big thing on the PlayStation 2?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Whatever happened to that?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Yeah. I don't know.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
But, yeah, the PlayStation Eye, though, they're definitely doing a lot of things with it.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
I mean, like, they have that, you know, eye... Was it a pet thing that's coming out?

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
And, you know, the other concept games that they've made, you know, where they can capture images and stuff that people draw.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
I wish they would actually...

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Look at that eye of crap.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I wish they would actually implement, you know, that.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Well, this wasn't the eye adjustment stuff, because scanning cards is retarded.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
That's been around forever, you know.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Hell, there's the e-reader on the Game Boy Advance.

25:09.000 --> 25:17.000
I'm talking about actually, you know, something unique where you can actually, you know, draw the tanks and stuff like that.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
That's kind of cool.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
But they never released it, because it was just a little demo that they made.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
All right. Well, guess what?

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
This rumor about motion controllers does not stop with Microsoft and the Xbox.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
Sony, apparently, is working on something as well, which shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, right?

25:33.000 --> 25:40.000
You know, Nintendo has been leading in sales, and, you know, the big thing that separates their system from their competitors right now is the motion controls.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
So, of course, Microsoft and Sony want to find ways to get a piece of the pie.

25:44.000 --> 25:51.000
So we hear this at a Microsoft's camp, and out of Sony's camp, there's a rumor, according to this blog, called The Cut Scene, which is related to Variety.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
So it's not just some Joe Schmo's blog.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
This is related to Variety, which is a huge magazine in the entertainment industry.

25:57.000 --> 26:02.000
Some sources leaked to The Cut Scene blog that Sony is going to be unveiling a new device at E3.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
It's not quite the same thing, though, that Loki's been describing for Microsoft.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
It's not a camera.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
It's something that's going to have pointing in it, apparently.

26:11.000 --> 26:17.000
It's basically, they don't know yet if it's going to be the regular controller infused with a pointer, which is a possibility.

26:17.000 --> 26:25.000
But this thing that I'm looking at, according to these patents, almost look like, I don't know, it looks like somebody's playing Samba de Amigo with these maraca-type things.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Now, they're not actually maracas, but the little pointers look like little devices.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
But here's the thing, though, is really they're targets that are being used with the PlayStation Eye.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Oh, you think?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
So it's not, I mean, it's basically like the reverse of the Wii setup.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
Instead of actually having the sensor bar just being a couple lights, and then having the receiver be in the actual remote,

26:51.000 --> 26:58.000
this is actually using the camera as the receiver, and then the points or whatever of reference are actually on the controller.

26:58.000 --> 27:05.000
Well, continuing on the patent here, they actually say, yeah, this small camera will track the movement of multiple LED lights on the controller.

27:05.000 --> 27:14.000
So if you use your PlayStation Eye, and maybe they're going to put lights in these controllers or something so that you can actually move them around, they call it a Wiimote in reverse.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
Well, because it wouldn't be that hard for them. They've already got 6-axis, which does all the tilting and that kind of stuff.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
Now they really need depth of field and kind of the IR pointing stuff that the Wii has.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
There you go, they've decided.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Well, let me read you this one final quote about this.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
Quote, because the camera can read different color lights and the shape and angle of each light, it's much more accurate than the Wiimote.

27:35.000 --> 27:43.000
It can track precise movements, including along the Z-axis, pushing towards and away from the TV, something the Wii is really bad at, as well as velocity.

27:43.000 --> 27:51.000
The fact that it's tracking actual colored lights and not just infrared, yeah, that does make it a little bit better because the Wii can pick up anything that's infrared.

27:51.000 --> 27:57.000
And if it mistakes a reflection of something, then it's going to get all messed up.

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
But that, I'm sure, if you're playing near a glass coffee table, like I do, it'll probably still tweak out a little bit.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Truth or bullshit?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Truth, but I'm not sure if they're announcing it at E3.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Interesting.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
Because they've had a lot of motion sensor patents and stuff.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
I mean, I could see them doing that.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
I mean, why not?

28:16.000 --> 28:22.000
Because they really don't have the casual sector yet, so, you know, Microsoft's made more of a move towards that.

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
But Sony, not so much, other than karaoke and, you know, trivia games.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
I'm going to say distorted truth.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
I don't think it's necessarily, I'm along the lines of what you're saying.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.000
I don't think that they're going to launch this whole new controller, this motion controller that you're going to have all this extra crap for your TV.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
I think they're going to find ways to use the devices they already have.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
Maybe releasing a new six-axis controller with the lights in it that's going to involve this.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
So I would say distorted truth.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
It's one of those where there's smoke, there's fire type of things.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
It can even be something even smaller, I mean, because they have a USB port on those controllers.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
You could literally just plug something into the top of the controller and run it off the power for the controller.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Dark Sockroach?

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
I was going to comment, you know, if you want to turn that phrase around, where there's smoke, they could be on something.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
That's true too, but I want to ask you, truth or bullshit?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
I really don't know.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
Every Sony rumor has been true, so let's just go with true on this, because seriously, every time they're like,

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
no, that's not really happening, we have no plans for that, what are you talking about?

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
And then it's like, oh, hey, look, price drop in PlayStation 2.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
That totally surprised you.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.000
But wait, how many times have there been rumors that the PlayStation 3 price is going to drop or be redesigned?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
That never happens.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
I don't think that's rumors.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I think it's wishful thinking.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.000
A lot of those rumors, though, are coming from people thinking, okay, Microsoft's dropping their price or, you know, this is coming out.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
They've got to drop it in order to be competitive.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
Well, they don't care, so there's no price drop.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Just consider the source.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
But it's going to happen.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
All right.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
So knowing that Microsoft and Sony, one way or another, we all pretty much agree, except Dark Sockroach is not sure,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
but we all pretty much agree they are making movements to go towards motion control.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
We at least all agree that Microsoft's going to do it.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
Well, let me put it this way.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
If one of them does it, it's either Sony or Microsoft, the other one's pretty much going to have to do it.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Of course Microsoft's going to do it.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
Microsoft has made their machine out of ripping off good ideas and doing it well.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
That's not a slam on Microsoft.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
They do a great job of ripping off good ideas.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
You know what I mean?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
And making them better.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
Anyway, here's what I want to ask.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Should Nintendo be worried?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Yes.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Because really, everyone's looking at innovative motion controls.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
That's what they pride themselves on, these games.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And granted, they have franchises and stuff.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Don't get me wrong.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Mario Kart's awesome.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Mario Galaxy's cool.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Zelda's really nice.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
But when you look at it, though, and especially with Microsoft, the price point,

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
if they start coming out with a Tiger Woods game that's motion sensitive on the 360, it looks better.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
It may be slightly more expensive.

30:56.000 --> 31:03.000
And a motion controlled game on the Wii, now it's not the only option for motion controlled stuff.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
You can get it on both platforms.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
And now that's a problem because a lot of people just pick up Tiger Woods game on the Wii,

31:10.000 --> 31:16.000
even if they own both because they want that extra kind of immersion for it.

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
But now you can take those awesome Red Steel or something like that, or Matterworld,

31:21.000 --> 31:24.000
that looks awesome but is kind of limited by the hardware.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
Now you've got more powerful hardware and the motion controls.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
That's going to be some really awesome games.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
And unfortunately, Nintendo, I can't see them doing anything very innovative at E3.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
And I bet you anything all their announcements are not going to be innovative

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
and they're just going to be sequels to their franchises,

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
much like a Pikmin 3 or a sequel to Wii Fit.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
Hell, they have a sequel to basically the Wii Mote coming out with Wii Motion Plus,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
the fix, something they should have had in the first place,

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
and a sequel to Wii Sports because that's what sells on their system.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
And funny enough, that's why I disagree with you.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I think Nintendo has nothing to worry about.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
Now, when I first heard this earlier in the week, I had the same reaction you did.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I was like, oh, Nintendo's fucked.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
Now they're going to have this new thing with the motion control.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
They're taking what makes the Nintendo Wii so great.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
They're putting it on this new hardware.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
Nintendo's screwed because everybody's going to want to go to the better looking games.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
But I thought about it, I thought about it, and I thought, you know what?

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
That's not really going to happen.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
At the end of the day, Nintendo is still going to have kids and soccer moms.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
And that's who they've built their audience on.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
That's how they built their system.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
That's who's still going to be loyal to them.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Remember, people are not buying the Wii for the Wii.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
They're buying the Wii for Wii Sports.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
And at the end of the day, Nintendo still has Wii Sports.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Will this put a crack in it?

32:39.000 --> 32:45.000
Yes. Some of the fanboys and the hardcore, a little crack might be put in Nintendo because of this.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
But is it enough to shatter Nintendo? Absolutely not.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
Yeah, they're already too far ahead, but I think it will slow them down.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
Because now they can't say that they have all this innovative control stuff.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Now they actually have to think on their feet and come up with something new.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
I mean, that's really, I think, what they should be doing, is coming up with something new.

33:02.000 --> 33:08.000
Because now they've caught up to, you know, you can only be really innovative so long.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Now people have caught up to what you had.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
Just like with Rumble and stuff, people started implementing Rumble, now everybody has it.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
It's like, you've got to come up with the next big thing.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
And here's the thing. Also, keep in mind, the motion is built into the Wii.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
It is a part of every Wii game because it is what makes the Wii.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
I mean, besides maybe a couple games here and there that decide to ignore it.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
But you know what I mean. It is integrated into the Wii.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
You know, the motion control is the Wii.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
With the Xbox 360, this is something extra.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
This is not something that they're putting in, that was not already in the system by default.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
So you're going to have to buy this extra peripheral device.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Unless they start including it with the system.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
They still have millions of units out there without.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
And do you think game developers are just going to ignore those masses?

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
They can just bundle it with a game that's like, you know, something that everybody wants.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
But look at the history of peripherals. Very, very few do well.

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
Most tank. Power Glove, U-Force, Power Pad.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
Video cameras, which we were just talking about, the vision cameras.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, but I think they would have done a lot better if they were bundled in with games.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Look at what Nintendo's doing now. Wii Fit.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
They want to sell a lot of balance boards, so what they did, they included the software free.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
They wanted to sell a lot of, you know, remotes and stuff like that, so they included a game for ten bucks more.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
I do want to say before somebody in chat screams their head off, some peripherals do break the mold and do well.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
Guitar and drum and DR have all shattered.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
The Wii Wheel.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
You'd be surprised how freaking popular that is for a piece of plastic.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
I mean, I don't...

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
But for the Wii Wheel, we had a Lynx Crossbow.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Here's the problem, though.

34:44.000 --> 34:50.000
Okay, and I understand, you know, Lynx Crossbow training, well, with the Wii Zapper, that sucked.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And yeah, the Wii Zapper is a horrible peripheral.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
The thing is, here's the problem that Microsoft has.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
All the people, though, that wanted, you know, the Wii, you know, for Wii Sports and that kind of stuff,

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
they're going to buy the Wii because it's cheap, you know, or cheaper.

35:03.000 --> 35:12.000
But now, you know, with Microsoft and stuff, actually, if they can come out with some sort of way to bundle in like a sports game in this motion sensor,

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
they might be able to pull it off.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
But they're going to have to have a must-have game with this.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Because if they try to pack in totem ball, don't fucking bother.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
Like, seriously, don't fucking bother, Microsoft, if you're going to put in a game of that quality.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
Like, they're going to have to put in a must-have game.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
And they got to be careful if they're going to try to be competitive with the Wii Sports thing, you know what I mean?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
They're going to need to have the must-have game with this in order to sell this thing.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
I mean, that's how Guitar Hero and all that, those peripherals did well, is because they came with must-have games.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Link's crossbow training, not so much a must-have game.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
DDR, pop culture icon of the late 90s, early 2000s, you know what I mean?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
It's, you know, the DDR pads did fairly well because of that.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
Yeah, and it also depends, you know, Microsoft's going after the core gamer.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
They're trying to get into more of the casual game market.

36:01.000 --> 36:07.000
Nintendo not so much anymore with the core game where they just want to bring on new people that haven't played games, which is sad.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I don't know, we'll see out of E3.

36:09.000 --> 36:14.000
I'm sure it's going to be exciting either way, but, you know, they have to do it right, the games have to be good.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
You know, because you're right, Total Ball sucks.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
HungryMister in chat says Halo 4.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I mean, that would be going for the juggler, but I just don't see that as being...

36:22.000 --> 36:27.000
Like, I don't know, when I see myself in the game, Halo's not really the type of game I want to be doing the most.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I don't think they're going to overshadow Halo ODST right now.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
I mean, that's more of an announcement for, like, next year.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
And they need something more than Halo, because Halo's not going to bring in the casual gamer.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
And to be fair, GameGuru said the same thing and said, that's the game you need to put the X mode in.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
I just, you know, I just think it would be if Halo 4 supports it, it'll help drive it, but I just don't think, you know,

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
I think they're going to turn off a lot of their Halo, because there's some people that don't want this.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
There's some people that are going to, you know, and that's what turns some people off to the Wii.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
They don't want to be up around flailing their arms about and all this stuff.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
You know, there's some gamers that don't want to do that.

37:03.000 --> 37:09.000
And I bet a lot of the Halo fans don't really want to get out of their seat and run around like a maniac to kill people in Halo.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
You know, they want to sit there with a controller and do it that way.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
So I think it would actually be a mistake.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Enhance Halo 4 with this? Maybe.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Mandatory? Probably not.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Alright, anyhow.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
I like to run and fill about and kill people.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
Well, then you're one of the folks that maybe would benefit from that, but I'm just saying the majority of Halo folks.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
The majority of Halo folks would not like it.

37:29.000 --> 37:34.000
So I don't know. What type of game would you like? Is there any type of game you think could be successful with this?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
I think the fitness bandwagon is where it's at.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
I agree with that, but I was also sort of thinking about a revival of, like, Marvel Madness maze games.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Where you control it with your hand.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
You know, that type of thing. I think that would be actually pretty fun.

37:48.000 --> 37:57.000
Or, if I was going to do a game and nobody steal my idea, I would actually do recess games.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Where you could have Virtual Red Rover and Simon Says.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
EA Playground did it first.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Okay, whatever.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I like that idea, though.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
That's kind of like Wii Sports, but different. I like that idea.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
EA is giving me Sims 3, so I'm happy.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
Alright, anyhow. Let's move on with some more news. I'm sure we will get calls on this later in the show.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
We will take your calls later in the show. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
But not right now. We want to get through the rest of the news first.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
We have more rumors, right DarkSakura?

38:24.000 --> 38:35.000
Well, the people that leaked the Forza 3 rumor have also sent in an image showing that there's going to be perfect dark on Xbox Live Arcade.

38:35.000 --> 38:41.000
And so, it could possibly be it has the same thumbnail image that Rare leaked in April.

38:41.000 --> 38:48.000
Okay, I was just watching what Loki was doing with the controller.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Loki's playing on Excitebots right now, so it's a little bit distracting.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
It looks a little perversion.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
It looks like you're driving the Batmobile or something. This is an interesting car.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
It is an actual bat he's driving. This game looks kind of fun, actually.

39:01.000 --> 39:15.000
As I was saying, the thought overall is that there could be more rare Nintendo 64 titles coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but there's not really enough to support it yet.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
We have to wait and see.

39:18.000 --> 39:26.000
I know there's a lot of perfect dark fanboys, and certainly I did not like that new one they had on Xbox 360, like their launch title at all.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
So, you know, going back to the classics, I think it would be a lot better.

39:30.000 --> 39:41.000
No, it's also funny. They also had Bean listed on there, which I don't remember if that was a codename for either the original Perfect Dark Zero, or if it's a sequel to Perfect Dark Zero.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
That was also listed on there, which is kind of funny.

39:43.000 --> 39:49.000
And then, of course, as Jamie mentioned, Forza 3. They once again teased Forza 3.

39:49.000 --> 39:58.000
They actually had the logo kind of, I don't know, poorly airbrushed over, but people could tell what it was.

39:58.000 --> 40:10.000
So, obviously, I mean, kind of going back to, hell, that old ass survey that leaked out all the information about Forza 3, you can better believe that it's going to be at E3 this year.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Of course, it's going to be big.

40:12.000 --> 40:22.000
And it's going to be funny, too, because Gran Turismo 5 still hasn't come out yet, and I don't know. I wonder when that's going to come out.

40:22.000 --> 40:30.000
But, of course, no details on it yet, other than, you know, Forza 3, kind of the logo is being shown there. You can tell it's Forza.

40:30.000 --> 40:39.000
Hmm. Forza, not a racing series I particularly get into. It's a little heavy for me, but I guess there's a lot of fans of Forza, certainly.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
So, I know there will be a lot of folks that are all about this at E3 this year.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
Well, we have other big, big rumors, and this one has to do with portable gaming.

40:47.000 --> 40:55.000
And, yes, it involves the PSP, and apparently the rumor has leaked out about the new PSP that's going to be shown at E3 this year.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It's called the PSP Go.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.000
Apparently the rumors are starting to snowball with this, and it's due to some 1UP reporting from earlier this week.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
According to some inside sources, apparently it's going to be getting a complete hardware redesign.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
It kind of, it looks to me like a cell phone with one of those screens that pops out like a sidekick.

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
Like, that's what this little machine, I don't think it's supposed to be like that, but the way this thing looks is it looks like a sidekick to me,

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
where the screen kind of pops out, and then you have the controller underneath it.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
This is the silliest thing I've ever seen in my life.

41:27.000 --> 41:33.000
It's interesting, isn't it? But if it collapses down into like the size of a little cell phone, I can kind of see that.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
It's still silly.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
I don't know. Yeah, it's kind of one of those things I'd have to see.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
Apparently it's going to have two different flavors, 8 gigabyte flavor and 16 gigabyte flavor.

41:41.000 --> 41:48.000
That's right, internal memory built in, although there's other rumors around that there may have some actual like tiny, tiny memory sticks that go with this.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
But here's the thing that makes this system so different.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
No UMD.

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
It's going to be, and meaning no disks, so meaning that the game will be entirely fueled,

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
and this is where the rumor's been going for a while now that there's going to be this PSP2 that's fueled this way,

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
that this PSP Go is going to be fueled entirely off downloadable titles.

42:08.000 --> 42:15.000
In fact, over 100 classic and new PSP titles, they are saying, available at the system's launch.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
One of the biggies, Gran Turismo Mobile.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
I hope for their sake they're not doing this move in hopes that it's going to cut down on their piracy,

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
because I'll have them know all the PlayStation Network titles that they have available.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
They're only for download only.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
Those have already leaked out, and they've leaked out just as fast.

42:33.000 --> 42:42.000
So they better hopefully fix whatever ways people have of exploiting their system and putting custom firmwares on,

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
because if they don't, this is going to be completely useless.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Although, at the same time, it looks neat.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
I know. I've got to say, I kind of disagree with Dark Soccer when she says it looks silly.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
I'm kind of interested in this. I don't know why.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
I already have a PSP, but I really like the idea of the fact that it's small.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
I won't have to worry about disks, because the system is going to be built in to play all these games.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
I don't worry about disks already.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Shut up.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
But you know what I mean.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.000
Me, the legal player, doesn't have to worry about this kind of...

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
If they have a good interface with the PC...

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
Well, I have a PlayStation 3, so it's not going to matter, because you know it will interface with that.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
But if they have a good interface with the PC, I kind of think this might be kind of cool.

43:22.000 --> 43:28.000
Well, right now they have the firmwares that are already up there where you can actually browse the PlayStation Store on the PSP.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
So, you know, it's just as easy as the PS3.

43:32.000 --> 43:39.000
What's interesting about this, you're not talking about a hardware upgrade with this, which is what I find really interesting about this.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
It's not a PSP2.

43:41.000 --> 43:48.000
That's where I'm kind of like, huh, at what Sony's doing here, because they're not taking this opportunity to upgrade the hardware at all.

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
And I don't really see the point of needing to hide the controls in there.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
I mean, really, is there any reason why you need a sliding screen, unless the screen is going to be touchscreen or something like that?

43:57.000 --> 44:04.000
Because it's a look thing, so if I put a little protector on the screen, I can carry it around in my pocket and not have to worry about breaking the buttons.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
It's just like a cellphone.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Yeah, the buttons don't break, though.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
You can seal the keyboard underneath the screen.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
I don't know, unless they're making the screen bigger, which would be nice.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
And I heard that was part of the rumor, that the screen was going to be bigger.

44:14.000 --> 44:24.000
And they're talking about some other PDA system that they have right now that's like some weird resolution, but they're maybe 720x480 or something, what they're going for.

44:24.000 --> 44:30.000
I don't know, we'll have to see. I'm sure if they're going to announce it, they're going to announce it at E3.

44:30.000 --> 44:36.000
Although, I kind of find it funny that they've already revised their system like three times already, so...

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
They're just trying to find the perfect fit.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
Let's read some comments from chat. This is stirring a huge response in chat right now.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment.

44:44.000 --> 44:50.000
Goldanthro in chat says, no UMD is fucking retarded, and the downloadable titles will probably be DRM to hell.

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
Deathwishing says, I like owning cases, that sucks. HungryMister says, oh shit, this is amazing.

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
TheRobD says, yeah, that's interesting stuff, it might be a good idea, I don't know if storage can support it though.

45:01.000 --> 45:07.000
That's kind of true too, is that when you're talking about how many games are going to fit on 8GB.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
The largest UMD game is 2GB.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
So, that you're talking like maybe...

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
But most of them are not 2GB.

45:14.000 --> 45:21.000
Okay, so maybe seven games. So, there better be an easy ass way for me to move games on and off this thing.

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
Like an iTunes-ish thing to manage my system.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
That's the problem though, is if you don't have high speed internet, even still if you have high speed internet,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
downloading a 2GB game is going to take a long time.

45:32.000 --> 45:38.000
And all these caps now too, with like Comcast and all this says 250GB and so on, that could be dangerous, right?

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
Well, I don't know if they're really worried about used game sales because their games don't sell that much anyways.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
So, I don't really see that impacting stuff.

45:46.000 --> 45:52.000
But, I don't know, if it's all digital, it's just going to make it a little bit cheaper for them.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Let me get some other comments from chat real quick.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
Tiger Claw says, I prefer owning a physical copy of the game rather than a digital version.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, not a fan of the no UMD deal though.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
I think it looks kind of neat too.

46:03.000 --> 46:10.000
Make the switch and do something like Nintendo. Put the game on a chip. A slot wouldn't take up near the space that UMD would.

46:10.000 --> 46:18.000
But, at the same time, this is not going to really sell to people that say, for example, own a bunch of PSP games already,

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
because now they've got to replace them all or buy them again.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
And really, do you think people are going to buy their games again?

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
I mean, that's wishful thinking, Sony, if that's what you think is going to actually happen.

46:26.000 --> 46:36.000
Yeah, that's another thing is that if I already own this game on UMD, there better damn well be a way that I can transfer this onto my PSP without having to re-buy the game.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
That's going to be shitty, if not.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
And I have a bad feeling that's where we're going.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Because how else is it going to know?

46:43.000 --> 46:51.000
And there's no other way, unless, I mean, the only thing I can think of maybe as another alternative for this is,

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
you know how they have DVDs now where they have digital copy?

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
Basically, it's a digital version of the movie. Sometimes it's on it, and sometimes you actually download it.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
Yes, that's how I got Mamma Mia on my phone, when I bought it on Blu-ray with a free copy.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.000
Exactly. Well, what if now they're going to have something similar where you buy a UMD game, and then you get digital copy as well?

47:09.000 --> 47:22.000
So, for example, if you don't say, I mean, if you have this only download game system that you can use that to play the game,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
and then maybe give the copy to your friend, I don't know.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
It doesn't sound like a good idea.

47:29.000 --> 47:37.000
Eventually everything will be digital, I'm sure, or maybe head that direction, but kind of making that leap now.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.000
And iTunes, I'm sorry, or the iPhone and that kind of stuff, that's a little different.

47:41.000 --> 47:49.000
I mean, the App Store, you have a lot of weird stuff on there, useful stuff, not necessarily just games.

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
And I'm sure if they had a way to do standalone games, they'd probably be selling games for it as well,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
but that's the only means to get stuff on there.

47:56.000 --> 48:02.000
And the fact that they're going to try to compete with that is kind of dumb with taking the UMD out of the picture.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
Hitstun in chat says, Sky, apparently you can go to a store and they'll have a kiosk that will transfer your UMD game to a memory stick.

48:08.000 --> 48:16.000
I hope to hell that's true, because if it's not, and I'm going to be forced to rebuy the game I already own on the PSP1, I will turn to piracy.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
But here's the thing.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
I mean, I hate to openly admit that on the show, but that's dumb.

48:21.000 --> 48:28.000
But that's even more retarded if they're going to do that, because what's going to stop Joe Blow from loaning his game to somebody?

48:28.000 --> 48:35.000
I could buy one copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and loan it to 50 people and they can all get it dumped to their, you know...

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
Unless they use a key.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
But not for old games. Old games don't have that.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
And each game isn't marked, you can't tell one from another.

48:43.000 --> 48:50.000
You know what, though? What about Joe Blow taking this latest CD that he bought at the store and his friend ripping it to his iTunes?

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
You know that happens rampily as it is.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
I know, but they're trying to figure out ways not to do stuff like that.

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
I mean, granted, we can assume that someone's doing that, but they're making it super easy.

49:02.000 --> 49:09.000
It's just like, you know, Rob, I can have you buy a game and then now we all have the game, because you bought the game.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Awesome!

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
You know, I like that idea.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
If it was that easy, here's my question to you.

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
If it was that easy and it was that open, would you steal the game?

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
Yes.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Damn you, you're not doing well for my troubles.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
Because there's nothing easier than not driving to the store and not, you know...

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
No, I mean, seriously...

49:30.000 --> 49:35.000
I don't understand you sometimes, because you pay extravagant amounts of money for some games and in other games you're just like, eh, I'll just download it.

49:35.000 --> 49:43.000
You know, that's the only reason I sometimes stick up for you, is because I know the disgusting amount of money you do spend on video games at the end of the day.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
So, I'm somehow strangely okay with the piracy.

49:47.000 --> 49:53.000
Let's look at, you know, a lot of the stuff I pirate or download is stuff that I'm trying out.

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
And granted, that's a stupid excuse, yes, but I literally play the game for five minutes and then that's it.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
I'm done, I don't play it anymore.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
Perfect example, Gardening Mama.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
I played that for two minutes today.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I will not be playing that game ever again.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
That game is getting deleted.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
But I'm glad I didn't buy it, because that game sucks.

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
And yes, I could have rented it, but once again, I have to go to a store, at the finest store, first off, that rents DS games.

50:17.000 --> 50:27.000
Go to that store, rent the game for, you know, $7 or whatever, and that still wasted gas, time, and money for something that took me two seconds to download.

50:27.000 --> 50:33.000
And, you know, I blame Nintendo for not having demos for their, well, they do have demos for their games, and I guess I could have tried it out online.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
Big deal, that still takes too long on the Wii, and really, I don't want to do that.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
But then if a game is good enough, you'll buy it, like a SiteBots.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Yes, exactly.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
SiteBots, I could have pirated that.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
It was out that same day, it was out early, you know, I could have pirated that, but no, I bought it because it's awesome.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
And, you know, Grand Theft Auto, I don't have to tell you how many times I've bought that game.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
I bought it on the PC and five times, actually six times on the 360, and all the expansions I bought six times.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
So, you know what, Rockstar has my money.

51:00.000 --> 51:08.000
Alright, I just wanted to present both sides of it for the people that get, you know, little angry clouds over their heads when you talk about piracy and all this stuff.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
I want to be fair and present both sides.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
And, you know, to be honest, the last game I played on my PSP, I don't even remember when.

51:15.000 --> 51:23.000
It was so long ago, PSP. The last thing I played on my PSP? Rift Tracks for Twilight, and that was awesome.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Alright, that's going to do it for our PSP discussion.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
If you want to call in about this later, I'm sure we'll get some calls about this a little later on the show.

51:29.000 --> 51:35.000
But we want to move on to some release dates and some non-rumors, things we know that are coming out very soon.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
We'll start off in the UK.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Sorry, UK, nothing till the 12th.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
What a bummer.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
Must be a slow release week, or a non-release week.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
I think that everyone's recovering from May 1st being a fertility holiday.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
Isn't there a bank? Yeah, I was going to say, isn't there a bank holiday?

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
That could be.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Maybe.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I think it was like on the 7th or something. I don't know.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
Alright, well then so much for UK releases. How about the US?

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
In the US, there's actually some stuff coming out.

52:00.000 --> 52:06.000
This week, actually speaking, it's very ironic that we were just talking about all these digital downloads.

52:06.000 --> 52:14.000
Patapon 2, the digital download only, or you can get the little card to redeem it, is actually going to be available on PSP this week.

52:14.000 --> 52:23.000
Also this week, we're going to be getting Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, part of the New Play Control re-release series on the Wii.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
Fantasy Aquarium World looks like shit, so don't buy it. It's on the Wii.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Really cheap though.

52:30.000 --> 52:37.000
Puzzle Kingdoms, a game from Zoo Games, actually created by the creators of Puzzle Quest, and it's basically a rip-off of Puzzle Quest.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
But you can get that on the DS this week.

52:40.000 --> 52:49.000
Knight of the Museum, Battle for the Smithsonian, that's going to be on Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this week.

52:49.000 --> 52:55.000
Also, Jagged Alliance coming to the DS, which, man, that's an old game that they're porting over there.

52:55.000 --> 53:02.000
Crysis, the Maximum Edition, I believe that's with Crysis Wars, the original Crysis, and the online multiplayer one.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
That's going to be available for PC.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
Destiny of Zorro coming out this week on the Wii.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
Leisure Suit, Larry Box Office Bust, finally coming out on the PS3.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
If I need to remind you guys, that got horrible reviews and apparently really sucked, so keep that in mind.

53:21.000 --> 53:28.000
And then probably the best one this week, Klonoa coming out on the Wii, which is pretty awesome.

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
The price now? $30 bucks. $30 bucks new. I mean, you can't beat that.

53:33.000 --> 53:39.000
And then, of course, you know, to go along with that, you have to have a really crappy game.

53:39.000 --> 53:45.000
Imagine Music Fest. Imagine if I cared. That's it.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Well, let's head on over to Japan.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
Actually, I want to start, though, because there's nothing on the Xbox 360 for Japan this week,

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
but there is something coming out in the other Asian regions, specifically China.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
It's the Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 bundle with a dance mat in China.

53:59.000 --> 54:07.000
The reason why I'm highlighting this is because this is a Chinese version with special songs for that region, like Chinese music.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.000
So if you're into, you know, you like the Chinese rock and stuff, you might want to check this out,

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
because I do not believe there's ever been a DDR with Chinese music.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
I know they've had Korean, they've had Japanese, of course, and American, naturally.

54:19.000 --> 54:24.000
I don't know if there's been one before with Chinese. That could be the first one, to my knowledge.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
On the PlayStation 3, nothing this week. It's a very slow week in Japan.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
It's looking very similar to Europe. Even on the Nintendo Wii, not a thing as well.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
There's not a release coming up until May 14th when you have a winning 11 game coming out.

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
On the PlayStation 2, nothing this week either. Same thing on the DS.

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
It is a very slow week in Japan right now, so not a darn thing being released except that DDR in other Asian regions.

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
So there you have it. We'll have more to talk about next week, hopefully.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
So let's get back into some gaming news.

54:53.000 --> 55:04.000
Well, there is a little news regarding a particular bit of rock and roll royalty, as in Prince, who is now, again, Prince and not, you know, that weird symbol.

55:04.000 --> 55:11.000
That was actually incredibly brilliant on his part, because I won't go into it. Look it up on Wikipedia.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
But still, he does some serious drugs or something.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
No, no, no. Well, you know what the whole thing was.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
No, I know. It's to free himself from his record label and da-da-da, but...

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I thought that was a smart move and more like...

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
That's why he did the drugs.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
...kicking, you know, giving them the finger.

55:25.000 --> 55:34.000
But anyway, Prince actually turned down a deal to have his songs in Guitar Hero.

55:34.000 --> 55:42.000
He has said that he doesn't have a problem with them, but he wants...

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
He thinks it's more important that kids learn to actually play the guitar.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
To put the effort into it and not have it just basically handed to you.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
He was quoted as saying, to play music is one of the greatest things.

55:56.000 --> 56:02.000
I agree with that, but at the same time, I think Guitar Hero and Rock Band gets people playing the fake guitars...

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Thank you.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
...and it gets them interested.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
Thank you. I'm like, you know, stop being arrogant. I mean, I understand.

56:08.000 --> 56:14.000
I know plenty of people who play those games who have zero interest in learning the guitar for real.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
They want the instant gratification.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
Well, but it's better than no appreciation for music whatsoever, right? You know what I mean?

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
Like, it's the same thing with Wii Music. Remember, we had this same discussion when Wii Music came out about how,

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
hey, as dumb as this game looks, if it gets kids interested in music, it's a good thing.

56:28.000 --> 56:33.000
It's different for, you know, younger kids, which I think Wii Music would more appeal to,

56:33.000 --> 56:41.000
than usually the people who are buying Guitar Hero and Rock Band already have an interest in the music they'll be playing.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
So, I don't...

56:43.000 --> 56:48.000
Now, one benefit with all the download content is being introduced to new bands and hearing new things.

56:48.000 --> 57:02.000
But at the same time, I really don't think that it's a great introductory medium now for people learning about music.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Wii Music, I think, is a completely different animal.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
I just, you know, I just think it's a darn shame that he feels this way because, you know,

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
When Doves Cry would be, like, the most epic rock band song, in my opinion.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
It would be fun. I would buy that in a heartbeat.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
You know what would be better than that?

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
What?

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
Let's Get Crazy.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Or 1999.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
That'd be fun, too.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
That's more synth.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
Yeah, but, you know, since we're never gonna get the keyboards, you know, we...

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Keytar!

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
They do synth-y songs in Rock Band once in a while.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
I just think it's a darn shame. There's some pretty kick-ass Prince songs.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
I wish they would just go above his head and go to Warner Brothers, which owns the old music, and just get it.

57:38.000 --> 57:44.000
No, honestly, honestly, I would rather them get it from, get the permission of the artist,

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
because that's more respect to the artist himself.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
He doesn't want his music in the game. He has every right to turn it down.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
And if that's his reason...

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
And I have every right to call him a cock-knocker because of it.

57:55.000 --> 58:02.000
If that's his reason, and it's his music, like, I would be the same way with my art if it was something that I didn't agree with.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.000
If I had done something, now, if it was something that I was doing just, you know, like, corporate something or the other,

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
and that's the purpose I was being paid for, yeah, but if someone saw something that I did,

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
and say, wow, I think this would work good in my ad for anti-puppies.

58:18.000 --> 58:23.000
But I like puppies, so I say, no, you can't, you do that. Or for, you know...

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
You made an ad against puppies? What's wrong with you?

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
What exactly is an anti-puppy?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
A cat?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Well played.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
Cats rule and dogs drool. Love, Jamie.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.000
If it was for something that I didn't really support on my own, then I would say no,

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
and it would be my right because it's my work.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
I agree with him that it's his work, he has the right not to support it with his work.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
But I have the right to think he's kind of a douche because of it.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
I mean, it's just fun. We just want to have fun.

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
You can think that all you want to, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still...

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
You're right, it's not going to change the end result, but...

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
It's still his right to say no.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
Luckily, though, for you guys, that Guitar Hero is put together so lazily

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
that there are a lot of programs out there allowing you to create your own custom mixes.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
I don't want to go to that kind of trouble.

59:16.000 --> 59:22.000
I know, I'm just saying that if you want to put the effort in, you could get your own,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
you know, Prince Guitar Hero.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
Yeah, but I'm too lazy and that's what it really boils down to, so what can you do?

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
But really, who would really want to...

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
Who would really want to own, like, a Prince Guitar Hero?

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I would not.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Unless it's like, you know, weird shaped guitar.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
I would if you get purple velvet suits with it.

59:40.000 --> 59:45.000
And if you get guitars shaped like that symbol, I actually might have to do it.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Come on.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
That would be kind of cool.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
See, even Loki can't resist.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
It's just because it's so ridiculous.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
I would like to see one that would actually have clips of purple rain in it.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Now the thing is, though, I want to see if they have, you know, available the... was it the Guitar Wolf microphones?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
You know, the ones that shot fire out of them when you sang into them?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Yeah, that's cool shit right there.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Wait, is that like Dance Dance Simulation?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I don't know.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
They have a Burning Man, the version of DDR that when you screw up it shoots fire on you.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:24.000
But all I know is Guitar Wolf is awesome, and the movie Wild Zero is retarded and, you know, awesome at the same time.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Anyways, there is some pretty interesting stuff, though, coming to Rock Band.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I'm actually kind of excited about some of this.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Mainly one song.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Why is the chat room screaming about glitter right now?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Death Wishing says it would also come with a lot of glitter.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Probably.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Hopefully it comes with a vacuum, too, then.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:01.000
You know, glitter is one of those things, like, if you throw glitter in your house, ever, or you let somebody that has too much glitter on their body, like, sit on your furniture, you will be finding that glitter like a year and a half afterwards.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Like, why is there glitter on my sofa?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Glitter sucks.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:19.000
This week, Rock Band is actually getting quite a bit of content, including a Franz Ferdinand 3-pack, which will include Do You Want To, Lucid Dreams, and Take Me Out.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:29.000
All those are available for $2 separately, or 160 Microsoft Points, or if you want to save 50 cents, you can buy the pack for 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.50.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Also, coming out, individual songs each for $2, or 160 Microsoft Points, including the one I'm looking forward to, Smooth Criminal by Alien Amp Farm, Blue Sky by the Allman Brothers, Midnight Rider by the Allman Brothers, Drain the Blood by the Distillers, Naked Eye by Lucius Jackson, or Luscious Jackson.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I love that song. That's one of the ones I'm going to buy.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And, let's see, Idealistic Types by Prong, and The Banishment by Prong, and that's coming out this week.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You know, it's not the play fanboy or anything here, and, you know, I'm really pro Rock Band, but it's sad when you see, and we're going to probably get into Guitar Hero's lineup for next month, or for this month,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.000
it's sad to see that what's coming out one week for Rock Band is about the same as coming out the entire month for Guitar Hero. Just, you know.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I still don't own Guitar Hero World Tour. I don't see the point.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Yeah.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
To be honest, like, all the songs I want to play are in Rock Band, and I don't mean to sound fanboy either, but too bad.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:41.000
You know, like, when I look at the list of songs in Guitar Hero, and put it next to the list of the songs, including download content in Rock Band, Rock Band wins for me, and I don't see the need to own both.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I don't. Now, the ironic thing, though, the guitar I own is a Guitar Hero guitar, so if you're Guitar Hero fanboy, just STFU, sit down.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I still own the Guitar Hero guitars.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Yeah.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
But, yeah, I don't really care for the game.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:06.000
And the best part about Rock Band, though, is there's a lot of songs available on their Rock Band store. In fact, they have finally hit the milestone of 666 songs.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Yes. 666. The most.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Was there a 666 song, like, Skynyrd or Marilyn Manson, or what did they do? Was there a celebration for the 666 song?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
No, there wasn't, but I didn't see what exactly was the 666 song.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Oh, I guess it was, um, it didn't really say it, but it was part of, whatever, Jane's Addiction's Nothing Shocking, one of those hit, you know, 666.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I guess Jane's Addiction works. I guess I can see that.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Yeah.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:50.000
At least it wasn't, you know, but it would have been funnier if it was one of those, like, you know how they've done, like, the SpongeBob SquarePants stuff, and the, uh, you know, they had some of the, like, the Nickelodeon show or whatever?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Like, it would have been funny if they had had, like, Hannah Montana or something as the 666 song that came out. That would have been pretty funny.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So, good times.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Alright, anyhow, um, there's other music games, of course, on the horizon, not just, you know, Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but there's a new Wii game called Wii Rock Drum King.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Um, the game apparently is, uh, already on its way to Europe, and it's gonna come out in North America this year, but here's the thing.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It's gonna get redubbed Rolling Stone Drum King, and that's, uh, not because it has a deal with the actual band, the Rolling Stones.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
It's based off the music magazine. You know, Rolling Stone, like, it's a huge magazine. It's like an oversized magazine.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000
They've been around for many, many, many years talking about music, and, uh, yeah, kinda interesting that it's gonna tie in there.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Uh, you're just gonna have to have two Wii remotes for air drumming. That's all you use in the game, and it's, uh, being developed by ARC System Works,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:53.000
and some of the songs that you can see in the game, We Will Rock You by Queen, Final Countdown by Europe, Song 2 by Blur.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
There you go, Dark Soccer. I know you're a Blur fan. Uh, Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz. Wow, there's lots of, uh...

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
That makes me happy.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:05.000
There's lots of Damon love in this, uh, particular game, and, uh, such 90s classics as All Star by Smash Mouth.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So there you go. Just some of the songs you can play in the, uh, Rolling Stone Drum King.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
So that's a name change from We Rock Drum King. So I guess it means lots of free ads in the magazine. We'll see.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Alrighty, a little more news for you guys before we take a break here at, uh, here on Orange Lunch Radio.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Well, there is a particular game that lots of people play just to make stuff in, and I am one of them.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Um, it's actually The Sims. There's stuff on Sims 3 out now. Um, there actually is going to be, um...

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You get, well, and again, this is, uh, written of course for the UK audience, but, um, you get, um, six pounds worth of Sim points to spend at a Sims 3 store.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And you can buy clothes and furniture and all kinds of other stuff, um, and you can get extra points in bundles of 500, 1000, and 2000.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Um, you also get a game launcher, which is, um, meant to be a hub for the Sims community.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So you can get information and downloads and uploads and stuff. All kinds of things.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You can take pictures of your Sims and do videos and meh meh meh meh meh meh meh.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000
So, um, if you go to TheSims3.com, um, you can find the marketing website.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:27.000
But, um, actually, uh, on the 5th of June, Cinco de Mayo, for all of us here who give a damn.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Wait, the 5th of June?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Sorry, I don't say, I meant 5th of June. I was thinking...

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Okay, okay, I have to go off, we were planning a party, so I've had it stuck in my mind.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Ah, that's alright.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Sorry. And, no, no, you guys aren't invited.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Aww.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I meant, well, you guys are invited. I'm talking about the listeners.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I didn't want to come.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Well, you gotta come sometime. Anyway, um, sorry, 5th June, um, which, uh, will have a full community and product site.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And a new town, which you can download. And some stuff that's coming out for PC, Mac, iPhone, and iPod Touch.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And I actually might have to play it on my phone.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
So you can go, uh, you people suck.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I just will be happy as long as there's, you know, textures and stuff.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I just want different ways to kill my Sims. That's really all I want.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I want more haunted houses. I want to make Silent Hill.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
In, in Simverse.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I always liked making the elaborate death traps in The Sims, so that'll be fun to do in Sims 3.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You know, I always like to build a pool with no ladder to get out, and so they drown, because they're not smart enough to just climb out the side.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
That's always fun.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I like going into debug mode and putting them up on the third floor of my house on a balcony that has no way out and a toilet.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
So that they at least could go to the bathroom, but they'd starve to death.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Didn't you try to build the diving board really high up into the pool?

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Yes, on the third floor.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
What you were going to do is you were going to pause it while they were in mid-air and then take out the pool?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
I wanted to do that, or I wanted to, I like, put the diving board out so that they, you know...

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
My favorite thing to do is just to make the human terrarium, where you get, like, all clear doors, you know, glass walls.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And then you put, you put them in the, you get them to go into the room, like, by leaving some chicken or something in there.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And then you pause the game and add the other walls so that people can just watch them.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I know what I'm, I know what I'm going to do.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000
You know, this new one, they've got, like, a lot of video, you know, editing features and that kind of stuff.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Saw.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Oh God.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I wonder if we're going to get any more strangerhood with The Sims 3.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Because that was pretty funny, by the guys that do Red vs. Blue.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
If I had more time, I'd say let's do, like, an OLR in The Sims. That'd be fun.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
We could totally.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I will never forget, however, the house that my old roommate built in The Sims, where he put, like...

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
What was the most people he could have in a house? Like, six?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So he put five men that would all, like, make out with each other and kiss each other and all this stuff.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
He put five men in the house and one woman.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And he forgot to put a bathroom in the house.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So everybody would just do their business on the floor.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000
And he'd make the woman clean it up and do all the cooking and cleaning.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
All the guys just continued their sex orgy all day and night.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And she never got to sleep and she finally died of sadness.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
But we were all laughing so hard at the concept.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Like, seriously, my side hurt from laughing so hard.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Because we're so mature. So there you go.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Okay, they're saying in the chat the limit was eight.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
That it was seven men and one woman.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And the woman had to clean up after the mess the guys made.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Good times.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:44.000
There's another game that's going to be revealed by Square Enix, apparently, soon.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Possibly at E3.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:55.000
This is coming from, they have a special URL at squareenix.co.jp slash mystery.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And there is a screenshot that looks like a giant rendered futuristic cityscape.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And basically a quote from John F. Kennedy saying,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:16.000
The world is very different now, for man holds in his hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And people are thinking, huh, that's probably Front Mission now coming out on 360 or maybe the PS3.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Should I get excited? I'm not very serious.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I don't know. Front Mission is a mech kind of military strategy game.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It's more of a tactical game.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And I think it would be very cool if they brought it out.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Oh yeah, I think I have played this, after all.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I think I did play this on another system.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
A long time ago.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Yeah.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Interesting.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And also, apparently, I guess the same image was used at Teaser, also in the official Xbox magazine, according to 1UP.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And the teaser text made it very clear that it was going to be Front Mission for the 360.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Without saying that it is, they pointed their finger at it.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Well, one game that has been confirmed that is coming out is a version of Soul Calibur for the PlayStation Portable.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It's coming out this summer. It's a game called Soul Calibur Broken Destiny.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Some of the first details leaked about this this week.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
It looks very similar to Soul Calibur 4, but it's not a port of Soul Calibur 4.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
It is kind of a new game.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Some of the characters that will be in it, Taki, Mitsurugi, Tyra, Astaroth, Ivy, Cassandra, Voldo, Siegfried, and Hilda are all going to be in this game.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Apparently, there's also a new fighter.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Dampier is the new fighter, and I guess this guy has wrist blades.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Kind of interesting.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Also, there's supposed to be some character customization, which has been in the more recent Soul Calibur games, and ad hoc wireless play.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Not over the internet, but at least you get that same room wireless play.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That's called Soul Calibur Broken Destiny.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I guess that could be cool. I like the Soul Calibur games.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm sad, though, that The Apprentice won't be in it, because that was the best character in Soul Calibur 4, was The Apprentice.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
You think so?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I think so, even though so many people hate him.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I think he was awesome.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
If you haven't played the game, it's The Apprentice from the Star Wars series.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I had Yoda and Darth Vader, and The Apprentice was the other Star Wars character, and he was pretty awesome.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Speaking of fighting games from Namco, I'll tell you what makes me super happy is Tekken 6.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000
It's going to be on the PSP, though, along with the console version, so that's pretty cool.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Except it'll have some exclusive content. It'll have certain items, certain stages, and a ghost mode,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.000
which means that you can download and share character data to play versus matches with.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So I guess sort of like how the conquest mode was in the old Soul Calibur in the arcade, where we used to beat up each other's characters.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
So it's pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Cool. There's another thing coming out, kind of tying in with the whole SNK fighting game series.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
SNK, The King of Fighters, is actually getting an online franchise, The King of Fighters Online.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.000
It's going to be developed by AAA Games, and apparently is a PC-only title right now.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And no word on whether that's coming out over here as well.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I know right now it's supposed to be available in the Asian regions, and it's coming out on the first half of 2010.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I can't tell if this is actually a fighting game or a brawler game, but it looks good though, so that's kind of cool.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.000
What's up with this? Didn't we just have a King of Fighters shoot-em-up last week, and now we have an RPG?

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I guess so. They're branching out.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Interesting. Why suddenly all the King of Fighters love?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a fun series, but it's a little weird.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I mean, really, a shoot-em-up with fighting game characters? A role-playing game?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
What the heck. This reminds me of the Mortal Kombat story modes and some of those...

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Like, you know the Mortal Kombat games they had on the Xbox and stuff? You had those story modes that were really cheesy?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
That's kind of what this reminds me of for some reason. I don't know if it has anything to do with that. I don't know.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week and the end of this half of the show.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
You might have heard us talk about a game previously called Six Days in Fallujah.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:47.000
It was a game that was going to be published by Konami, and the game had to do with one of the big battles that happened in, of course, the recent Iraq war that is actually still going on.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Well, Konami has pulled a plug on it with this quote.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000
After seeing the reaction of the video game in the United States and hearing opinions sent through phone calls and email, we decided several days ago not to sell it.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000
And that came from a Konami spokesperson talking to Sahi, which is a Japanese news site.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Don't know, though, if the game has been pulled entirely because, you know, the developers, Atomic Games, they could still put it out with another publisher, but this is certainly going to be a dent in it.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
So, and some people are saying, you know what? It was just too soon.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Do you think it was? Do you think it was too soon for a game like this?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:35.000
No. It's relevant. I mean, you wait any longer, it loses its relevance. It doesn't have the same impact it would otherwise.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I kind of agree. If you don't like it, don't buy it.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I mean, I went about this game because I don't like war games anyway, whether it's World War II or, you know, history wars.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
There's very few of those types of war games I'm into at all.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:56.000
So this, I just kind of looped this in with that category. But, you know, these memories, you know, there have been people that died in this war that has happened very recently.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I had a friend from high school who passed away in Iraq. It's tragic.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And so why would it actually be respectful to pay what they went through justice? I think.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Oh, I don't have a problem with the game, but I'm just, you know.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:15.000
This actually goes to me with a tendency of people to want to bury their head in the sand and ignore that bad shit happens in the world, you know?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
You know, people who just want to go, oh, well, that sucks. Boohoo. Paris Hilton. Oh, my God.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You know, it's that whole, we want to look past it and not think it was really there by claiming that it's too soon or disrespectful or whatever.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:40.000
But I think that people really need to have the reality of the situation driven home. And what better way to do it than a video game that's based off of accounts of people who were there?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:47.000
You know, maybe I'm just desensitized to the whole too soon thing. You know, I've mentioned on the show before, I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show for years and years and years.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And we like to make jokes about things that are oftentimes, it's way too soon to make the jokes.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:02.000
For instance, the last time I went to Rocky Horror was the day that Bea Arthur died. And somebody cracked a joke that evening about how, did you guys hear Bea Arthur died of cancer today?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And it was really sad. It's too bad that she had testicular cancer. See? See? And you're laughing.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I know. That's fantastic.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
See? But like, you know, that was the day she died.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
But this wouldn't be meant to be humorous. It's a different story.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
No, I know. I know. I know.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
You know, I'm a fan of shock humor. Don't get me wrong.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I say that because we all have different ways of remembering things. You know what? And for me personally, I laughed my ass off at that joke.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
But I loved Bea Arthur because I grew up on the Golden Girls. You know, I remember watching that with my mother, you know.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I just remember watching the Deadpool PSAs with him having a poster in his room that says, don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like Bea?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000
All right. But look, look, look. But my point is, is that, you know, some people laugh at funerals and that's just how they cope.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I don't know. Loki, you wanted to say something. I'm sorry.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Oh, I was saying that people probably take offense to the fact that the game, not only they spoke to, obviously, the soldiers that were fighting over there, but also the insurgents as well.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Including, you know, some terror cells or that kind of stuff.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:10.000
So, I don't know. Whatever. It probably wouldn't have been that good anyways, to be honest.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:19.000
But I'm sure it'll come out eventually. There's a lot of publishers out there and a lot of them that like to take, you know, games like this that are done and publish them.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Especially smaller companies that'll take the ones that no one else wants.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:31.000
All right. Well, we will see what will become of this game, if anything at all. And if it raises a ruckus when it comes out.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I'm sure there will be that sensationalist news report, you know, the Channel 13 Looks exclusive look at this, you know, oh, there's a video game that you can replicate what's going on in Iraq.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.000
And it's just gonna, people are just gonna not get the context of it and take it the completely wrong way. So, whatever.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Anyhow, let's get into a happier subject, shall we?

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I want to talk about Bea Arthur.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
We can talk about Bea Arthur, but that's not usually what this music is for.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I am.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:10.000
This music symbolizes the classic video game of the week. That's right, a segment on the show where Dark Sakura digs through the archives of games and finds one that she believes you should all be playing.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And, you know, especially with knowing what Dark Sakura's picked this week, classic doesn't have to be super old.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Even more recent games can be classics.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Well, the one I picked is, you know, eight years old.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
All right, so it's still...

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
So I want to see if our people in the chat room can figure out what it is based on the intro to the game.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Here it is.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:42.000
James, honey, did something happen to you after we got separated in that long hallway?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Are you confusing me with someone else?

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
You were always so forgetful.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000
What about that time in the hotel?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Maria?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:08.000
You said you took everything, but you forgot that videotape we made.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I thought people would totally...

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Yep, we got guesses already, and we're pretty close.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
It's Silent Hill 2.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
The Rob D is the first one to get it.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Guess what? You win something.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Hmm.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
The Rob D, you win my TurboGrafx.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Wow. That was easy.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Yep.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I can even take it to him, too.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Okay.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
All right. Get it to me next week. We'll go take him TurboGrafx.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
We'll have to autograph it.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.000
So, Rob D, you win my No Controller TurboGrafx.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I didn't even know you were doing a giveaway.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
That was the surprise.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Well, look at you. All right.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
So, I have to just remember where we put it.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Anyway, we've been cleaning.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:58.000
So, yes. Silent Hill 2 is the game du jour, or I should say, of the week.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And the reason why I picked Silent Hill 2, even though this is not my favorite of the Silent Hill series,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
it's a lot of people's favorites.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
So, I wanted to throw the bone out to the big fans of Silent Hill 2.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So, with this particular game, it's, you know, basically this guy goes back to the town of Silent Hill.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
It's, you know, third person's perspective.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
You play as this dude named James who is mourning the loss of his wife, Mary,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
and he gets a letter from her saying they meet at their spot, and instead he finds Maria.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So, as the game goes on, it's pretty disturbing Silent Hill stuff, blood, pyramid head,

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.000
and yes, this game is the introduction of, by proper name, Red Pyramid.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Two of them, in fact.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So, that's pretty awesome.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
This is the game that gave us the Red Pyramid.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Or as you all know him as, happy fun time rapey pyramid head.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Pea-hitty.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Pea-hitty.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
That's why I call him a pea-hitty, you know, we're tight like that.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Anyway, so you know, you solve your little puzzles, and you pick up things, and you find things,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
and you get a chainsaw at some point.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Chainsaw is awesome.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
And, which I've seen Shane beat the game with a chainsaw, didn't he?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I wasn't there for that.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
He beat Pyramid Head with a chainsaw.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
That's fun.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
That was pretty cool.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
One of the times, anyway.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And of course, you've got your chick, Maria, hanging out with you, who, well, poor girl has no luck.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I won't say anything that happens to her, but if you haven't played it yet, oh well, whatever.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
You also have multiple endings on this game.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
You've got up to, you have three endings.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Over there!

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Actually, yeah, three endings, I think, involving the actual story of the game.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Some of them are really fucked up and sad.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Some of them are, oh, there's one that's kind of happy.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And then, you get joke endings.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You get the UFO ending, which every Silent Hill game has.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000
And then, my favorite, the dog ending.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:19.000
With the, of course, with the dog ending, it's just, it shows that a Shiba Inu is actually controlling the entire events of the game.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
And of course, the UFO ending, James gets abducted.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:37.000
There's also, though, yes, this is the music from the dog ending.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I love the dog ending.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I love the dog ending, too.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I just, like, he comes over and goes, what? You did all this?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
And the dog comes up and licks him.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I like that the dog, though, is wearing headphones, listening to a Kiriyama music.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:02.000
At any rate, there's also some of the newer special versions.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Well, in the special edition releases, there is a game, a little side story called Born From a Wish.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And this is actually in the Restless Dreams edition, or for Europe, the Interfears edition.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Ow, what's wrong?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I just pricked myself.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Also, I believe the Japanese one is called Saigo no Uta, which is Poem of the Last Moment.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:38.000
But it is, it has the Born From a Wish story where you play as Maria, the other character in the game, leading up to her meeting with James at the beginning of the game.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
It's a very, very interesting, actually, little, little story.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
So, uh... I just want to point out, this is a scary, scary game.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Like, if you've never played a game like this before, you've got to try these types of, like, survival horror games, especially the Silent Hill series.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Because I'm telling you, these games are, like, so scary, like, they'll make your asshole slam shut.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Like, you know what I'm talking about. Like, one of those games where you're so tense.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Like, you're like, oh my gosh, I'm so scared, I don't know what's going to happen next.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
So, this is a scary game.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Like, if you don't, if you think games can't scare you, play a game like this.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
With all the lights off during a rainy night.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Well, the biggest thing, and this is why I like the Silent Hill series so much, is that it's a big look into the disturbing parts of the human psyche.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
That's why I like it.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:36.000
There's actually an enemy in this game who looks like, well, like a big rape going on.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
But that was the person that that's supposed to be, that's, you know, what he did.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And, of course, Pyramid Head goes around banging all of the nurses and monsters and everything, getting in the way.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:59.000
There is, also for the main character, like, you go into a room and he finds the dress that his dead wife wore.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And, you know, different things that relate to his psychosis, including the Red Pyramid being part of his psychosis.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
The only character who does not see any of the monsters in the game is a little girl because she is innocent.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000
She doesn't have those type of deep-rooted, you know, issues going on.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Even though I seem to recall her being kind of a bitch.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
She was. But she didn't have to deal with any of that as a point.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Also, another thing that I was looking at is that the character Mary came from Mary Ann Nichols and Mary Jane Kelly, who were Jack the Ripper's first and last victims.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And, you know, there was a character based off of Eddie Murphy when he was supposed to be, you know, more pleasant.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And a character named Angela, who was based off of the protagonist in The Net.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Oh, I never realized that. Interesting.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:03.000
They've all been... And also, and this is something I didn't know, the layout of Silent Hill in the game was based off of San Bruno, California.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
So, it is, to me, one of the best games ever. I love the soundtrack.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I actually used to wake up every morning to the theme of Lara, which was on that soundtrack.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Every morning. Until I got sick of it and had to change it to The Birthday Massacre.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000
And, also, if anyone wants to know about the movie, yeah, the second movie's coming, but Gons isn't involved.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
So, has nothing to do with the game, though.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Well, as far as this game and that story being involved together, but, yeah, Silent Hill 2 is freaking rad.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Play it. And, by the way, my favorite is Silent Hill 3.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Alright. Well, there you go. Your classic game of the week, Silent Hill 2, available on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And PC, but don't play the PC version, because it's ass. Bunch of ass. Worst control ever.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Alright. And then, maybe in the future, we'll hear a little bit about Silent Hill 3, since it is your favorite of the series.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Alright. Anyhow, though, we are going to take a break.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
We're pretty long. We've been going for about an hour and a half. It's about 7.40 here on the West Coast.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
We're going to take a break, and when we come back, more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:26.000
We have plenty of news stories we still have to get to, including a very interesting remake that we've heard about that's going to be on the way for Xbox Live Arcade and possibly some other games as well.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
As well as some game delays and some more rumors. It should be fun.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Also, stay tuned, because guess what? The contest, you know, I didn't even know.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It was such a surprise contest we just had on the show. I didn't even know it was happening.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But Dark Soccer just gave away Turbografx-16. That's not the only thing we're giving away tonight.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000
We are giving away a signed autographed copy of DDR on the PlayStation 2, signed by SmileDK.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
And that's thanks to Breslul, who got that at the SakuraCon.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
So we're going to be telling you more about that contest very soon on the podcast. Just stay tuned.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
This is not something you have to be listening to live. Our podcast listeners will get a chance to win this as well, as well as our live listeners.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
So stay tuned. We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. And guess what, guys? It's time to do the giveaway.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Or at least I'm going to tell you guys a little more about the giveaway.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000
But first we are going to turn the moderation on in the chatroom there so that there's no talking amongst chat.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
So that you guys don't try to give away the answers to each other.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Here's how it's going to work. What we're going to do, we're going to play five clips of DDR songs from the past.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And if you know the answer to all five songs, send an email to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:50.000
And make sure that somewhere in the subject you say, contest, or it will get mixed up with the regular emails we get in there.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.000
You need to say, contest. And if you know the answers to those, we'll draw one from the total...

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Whoever has the most correct answers, we'll draw from that.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So even if you don't know all five, send it in anyway. Because if people can only get four of the five, you might still win.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And again, what you're going to win, a copy of DDR Supernova 2 for the Playstation 2, autographed by SmileDK, who is infamous for Butterfly.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And various other DDR songs as well. You should know them if you're a fan.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
We want to make sure a fan of DDR wins it, so this is how we're going to test you.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:33.000
We're going to play clips of five DDR songs, so here we go. Here is song number one.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Here is song number two.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Here is song number three.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Here is song number four.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And lastly, here is song number five.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Okay, there it is. Those are the five songs. This is open to the podcast listeners as well.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000
We're not going to draw a name until two weeks from tonight on our show on May 17th.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I guess that would be two weeks from tonight.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
May 17th is when we'll draw the name, so get those contest entries in. Again, you want to get as many of those songs as possible.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Send in those emails to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Make sure the subject says contest somewhere in it or it will not count.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I can't stress that enough. You need to put contest in the subject or something with the word contest in it.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
You can put I love Rob, contest. As long as the word contest is in there, it'll be cool.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:06.000
So there you go. The five songs for the contest this week. Giving away an autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2 by SmileDK.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Alright, I'm going to let you guys be able to talk and chat again. No giving away answers.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Alright, no giving away answers. There we go.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Okay, I guess we're ready to get back into tonight's Orange Lounge Radio, so let's do it.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000
May the 3rd of 2009, where we tape live. Every Sunday night, of course, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:38.000
On All Games Radio, www.AllGames.com is where we tape our show and allow you guys to interact with us through ways such as chat and so on and so on.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Alright, let's get back into some gaming news. We had a pretty fun first segment talking about some different things.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Let's get back into gaming news. Loki.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Well, apparently, it's the 25th anniversary tour for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They have an exhibit traveling across the country right now.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And part of that exhibit is a game being shown off on the Xbox 360.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
It's an alpha version of what looks like a remake of Turtles in Time.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And by the looks of it, you would probably guess that it's for Xbox Live Arcade.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
But, of course, possibly could make its way to the Playstation Network and WiiWare as well.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000
And it looks kinda cool, but definitely looks like Xbox Live Arcade material.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So, pretty cool.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I know this is a game a lot of people are very excited about.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Yeah, and it is alpha right now, so it could be a while.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I like that they've kinda reskinned it. It's not just a re-release of the game, but they've totally reskinned the whole thing, which is kinda cool.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Yeah, it looks nice.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.000
So, alright. Very cool.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Well, that's not the only release coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Space Invaders Extreme looks to be finally getting a release on Xbox Live Arcade this week.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Hurray!

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Probably because the game, I think, was supposed to be out last month, but finally they're saying it's gonna see its release this week for approximately 800 Microsoft points.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
They're not 100% sure if that's gonna be the final cost, but it looks like 800 Microsoft points.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Microsoft should either confirm or deny this tomorrow on Monday.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But I know I love this game on the PSP, so I'll probably pick it up on Xbox Live Marketplace, too, because I think it'll be fun to play in high def.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000
It has a great soundtrack. It has a great, great soundtrack.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
So, I'm definitely looking forward to this game.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
So, I'll check that out this week.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Well, how about something that has really nothing much to do with Xbox Live Arcade?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Okay.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
It has to do with the zoo.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Yes, the Edinburgh Zoo renames their Wolverine in honor of Wolverine.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
They named him Logan.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And I guess the tie-in that this has is that the picture that they put up is a picture of the Wolverine, and behind him was one for the game, Standy.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:54.000
But they are using the, I guess, the fame of the movie right now to promote the fact that these are endangered animals.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I know Tigerclaw was in chat before the show telling me I need to check out the game.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
He says the game is better than the movie.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And that's kind of surprising to hear because usually movie-based games are crap.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
But he says the game based on the movie is pretty good.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Well, I should give it a rent.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Yeah, you should. Definitely check it out and let us know.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Because, you know, you are the comic book fangirl.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Did you participate in Free Comic Book Day?

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I didn't.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Oh, no. How sad.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I had lots to do.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Oh, that's a bummer.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
I was going to get out there, but I just, you know, forgot.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I've never been much of a comic book nerd, but hey, it's free.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
You should have gone and got me one.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
I know. I just forgot.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And I had other stuff going on yesterday, so I just never thought to go to the comic book store.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
So, oh well. It happens.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Alright, let's move on. More gaming news.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Yes. Let's see. Well, we've got some other, well, kind of unfortunate news.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Also kind of tied in with the movies. You know, the whole Batman stuff.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Very successful movie.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Well, there's of course a new game coming out for Batman.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Batman Arkham Asylum. It's supposed to be out in June.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000
However, it's been delayed now to the end of summer.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
D'oh.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Why? Just because they can?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Basically that it's, you know, to ensure, give the devs an extra amount of time to make sure the game is, you know, the highest quality for gamers.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000
So, in other words, the game's broken right now. It's got too many bugs. They don't want to release it the way it is right now.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
I guess.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
That's what it sounds like to me.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Alright, well, you know, I guess, isn't it worth the wait, though?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
If they're going to fix the problems with the game, it's worth the wait, right?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Definitely.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000
It makes sense, though, to position it more towards the fourth quarter because it's, you know, a pretty big game.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
This game does look kind of interesting, I gotta say.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Yeah.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
So, I will definitely check it out.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Well, you know I love Batman anyway, but usually the games aren't that great.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
There hasn't been, like, a really, really good Batman game that I've loved since the NES Batman game.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Batman Returns?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
No, the original Batman game.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Nintendo?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Huh.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
That they had. That was the last one I really remember liking.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
I guess I heard Lego Batman's pretty good, though. I haven't checked it out, though.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Supposed to be. I haven't played it, though.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
I haven't played it, so maybe I'm not being fair, so we'll see.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Hopefully soon.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Alright, moving on.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Lost Planet 2 is the game we knew was coming.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Apparently some new footage has been revealed for Lost Planet 2.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000
And apparently Capcom is trying to get a demo available for E3.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And guess what?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Not only is it going to be playable on the show floor at E3, but they are going to try to do one of those, you know, bring it home type things on Xbox Live again.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000
They did with the first one.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Yep, and they'll release a demo during E3 for everybody to play at home via Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And this is all from the Capcom Unity blog.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
There's some new trailers, some new screenshots that you can look at.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And they are hoping that there will be a demo available by E3.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000
By the way, there will be four player co-op in the game if you haven't heard yet.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And there's going to be a ranking system as well.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So you can compete for the biggest E-peen in Lost Planet 2.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Which looks to have ditched the snow for more of a... looks like more of an Amazonian...

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Well, they didn't really ditch the snow, it's just the planet's starting to thaw.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Oh, okay.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Which I guess there was a little bit of it in the first game.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
They put it in a defrost setting in the microwave.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Apparently, because it does look a little thawed out this time.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
So it looks a little more jungly.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000
You do still see the snow in some parts, but, you know, has more of a lush green look to it than last time.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Well, you know, there's other things that have, you know, a green look to them.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
And that would be zombies.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Zombies typically look green or gray.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Well, usually they're red after dining on blood.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Well, enough blood on them, yeah.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
But I mean the flesh tone, you know, is kind of that green gray sickly looking thing.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
But there is news about Dead Rising 2.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.000
When they said that there were going to be multiplayer sessions.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Well, they were actually correct on that one.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Capcom said that there will be online multiplayer.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
No details on it, but said that there will be.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
So that's cool.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Oh, the one thing that Dead Rising 1 was missing is going to be in Dead Rising 2.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
That sounds pretty amazing to me.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
As long as you can still run over Amino with a lot more.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Hopefully. That's what I'm hoping for.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Well, they were showing off some pretty cool stuff.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Apparently the main character now, since he's not, you know, a photographer.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
He's more of like a carpenter guy.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
He can kind of fashion his own weapons.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So he had like two chainsaws strapped to, you know, this giant, you know, stick.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
And then he strapped two chainsaws to his motorcycle and drove through a crowd of zombies.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
So he gets the MacGryverism skill?

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Yeah, and apparently they had up to 7,000 zombies on screen at a time.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
So, that sounds sweet.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Another thing that sounds kind of sweet, actually, even though the first game was very disappointing.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Red Steel 2.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Red Steel 2 has been announced and it's apparently going to the Wild West.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
It's going to feature motion plus support.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I'm not really sure if it's actually a Wild West game, but, you know, the main character kind of looks like he could be out of the Wild West.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:15.000
But it looks really cool and they kind of got this cel-shaded look to it as well, which, you know, is kind of the rage nowadays.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And it looks pretty cool.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000
One word, though, that I have heard about it, though, is that it's supposed to be only motion plus.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
You have to use motion plus to play this game.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.000
So I don't know if they can actually do that, if that's going to be, you know, kind of a deal breaker for some people.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Motion plus with sword fighting sounds awesome.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Because I know the first game, man, control sucked.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Do you think it's really going to get better or is this kind of one of those, you know, all talk?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I think it could get better, but it's not even perfect.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
I mean, they could very well make it, you know, really good.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
But before, you know, the controls were kind of wonky, but we'll see.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I mean, they did some pretty innovative stuff with it, but it just didn't work very well.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
GS68 in chat disagrees, says no Red Steel 2 will suck.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Act-Def says they'll probably bundle Red Steel 2 with motion plus.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Well, they're doing a lot of those bundles.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
They got to try to sell that motion plus.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
So does this mean that motion plus is going to be required for the game?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Yes, that's what they're saying right now.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Interesting.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.000
So if they don't have a bundle with motion plus, aren't they severely limiting their audience?

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I think so.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I would think people who would buy this would not necessarily be the same audience that's going to pick up a game like Wii Sports Resort, you know?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Well, motion plus is going to be sold separately, though, over the month prior to that.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And they've also got a bundle with, like, Tiger Woods.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:46.000
They're also doing a bundle with EA Sports Tennis Grand Slam that's going to be, or Grand Slam Tennis that's coming out, you know, before Tiger Woods even in Europe.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And who knows, I mean, more bundles with this thing.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
They got to sell those, you know, motion plus things.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:58.000
They got to get people to realize, hey, you guys should spend another $20 on sensors that should have been in there in the first place.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Exactly.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And then we can come out with the controller with the sensors built in. Ha, bitches!

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Yeah.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Then they can think of something else they forgot.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Then it'll be, oh, but now you want to get the Wii HD so that our graphics can be on there.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Oh, you need to get the Wii Balance Board Plus because now it has more sensors and is even more sensitive than before.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I bet you anything you'll see something stupid like that.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Haven't there already been rumors of a Wii Fit Plus?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Yes, there has been a Wii Fit Plus with the Balance Board, but I don't know if that's just the same Balance Board.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
It might be the same Balance Board, I mean.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I don't know. Have you ever tried controlling Balance Board games? It's not very fun.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Just Wii Fit and it works okay. It's not that bad.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Like the marble rolling game?

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Yeah, it's alright. It's very, very sensitive. It's very, very, very sensitive.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
But I think because those games are supposed to challenge your balance, it's why it's that way.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I haven't played any of the standalone balance games. There hasn't been anything that really, you know, caught my eye that I really want to get.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:05.000
But this caught my eye and is something I probably really want to download. It's a remake of Adventure.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000
And I'm talking about Adventure for the old school Atari 2600. That's right.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:16.000
It has apparently been remade, and I guess this is by folks that frequent the Penny Arcade forums.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
They've done a completely unauthorized version. It's called Adventure 2600 Reboot.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Here's what makes this game cool. They've basically taken the Adventure setup and they've redone the whole darn thing in like 16-bit graphics.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And we're looking at a little YouTube here in studio what this game looks like.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
And it's pretty cool because they actually have the dragon flying around and it's kind of neat.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
But if you run into it, it'll eat you like it just did there.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Or you can get the sword and, you know, you remember the old game on the 2600? You get the key, they go up in the castle.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Well, they redid it in like all these cool little like 16-bit sprites. So I thought that was kind of cool.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Apparently this project took about seven months to complete. Kind of interesting.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.000
The person who coded and designed Reboot, William Steinberg.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000
And he had a whole little interview with Game Set Watch talking about it.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:10.000
And it was a whole team of people. It wasn't just this guy, but he was kind of the spokesperson talking about the project.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
So pretty cool. I might have to check this out.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Do you think you will? For real?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I think I will. For real. If you want to find this, it's at slash x dot google pages dot com.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
There's a whole little page about the Adventure 2600 Reboot.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And I get the sense why? Because we can.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
There you go.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
All right. So moving on now, we're going to get into tonight's mailbag.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
When you guys send us emails at mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader dot com, we like to read our favorites here on the air.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And that's what we're going to do right now. DarkStalker is going to dive in.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I don't think there's a whole lot of emails tonight, sadly.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
About your tongue.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Oh, did we get a lot?

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
We got a few.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Cool. So DarkStalker is going to dive in.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Good, because I put on the Twitter earlier that people needed to make you work. So I'm glad to hear they are.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
What did you do that for?

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
All right. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader dot com if you want to make her work.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
This email. Cake or pie? That battle of the century.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
From someone who sincerely loves old people.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Pie.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I like a good chocolate cake.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Pie always wins.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Okay, we actually have one from Dan Shadow.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Hey guys, what's more dangerous? Chimps or raptors? Help me out here.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Are these for real tonight?

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
I am serious and I'm reading them because you fucking made me.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Oh god, raptors. Look at Jurassic Park. Although chimps can carry Ebola virus like you saw in Outbreak.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
You're thinking of velociraptors. A raptor is like a hawk.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Aren't velociraptors a kind of raptor?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I think chimps are dangerous if you give them a gun.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
What if you give a raptor a gun?

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Well, here's the thing. If you're actually talking about velociraptors, velociraptors are extinct and chimps are still alive and full of diseases.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So obviously it's chimps.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Fine.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Now if velociraptors came back from the dead, they would probably be full of diseases as well.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Raptors. Raptors are...

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I would bet anything the emailer meant to say velociraptors because raptors by themselves are not that scary.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
But velociraptors, terrifying.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:10.000
But they're carnivores.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
And raptors, the jets, those are pretty dangerous too, you know.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
And the raptors flying velociraptors.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
This comes from Gil.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
And the monkeys, the band, I don't know how dangerous they'd be.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It's my first time writing in and I'll make it a short one.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
What do you think about the new PSP Go?

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000
How long until it will be hacked because the 3000s are not hackable to the public yet?

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Should they release the hack or wait for the new PSP?

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
If they were smart, they would wait for the new PSP to come out, but they won't.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
They won't.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:45.000
They've already got a sort of proof of concept done already for the new PSP 3000.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Hacker groups are pretty competitive.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
They don't want to sit on it and wait to have someone else beat them or else all their work is for naught.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
But you will better believe that when that new system comes out, all they have to say is unhackable.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
And then they'll be like, oh, we're going to get down on that shit.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
And it'll be hacked before you know it.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
It may take a little bit of time.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
The problem is it may have to use an exploit in the game to do it.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.000
But it'll be interesting because if everything is downloadable, they'll start to sneak the patches in the games and all that.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
So you'll have to, you know, patch.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It will be interesting.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:18.000
You know, they're always going to find a way.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
They're always going to find a way to hack it.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
This one.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Ready for the next email?

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Yes.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Hey, OLR, I was wondering if you guys buy the PSP 3000.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I've been thinking about, OK, bad grammar.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I've been thinking about it.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I currently own four PSP 2 Slims and a THAT.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I'm interested in your thoughts because tonight you're going to talk about the PSP.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It's Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E, not Y-O-U-R. That's possessive. Duh.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Maybe I should just wait instead of just wait for the rumored PSP 2.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Sorry for the late notice.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
L-O-L-C-U in chat.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Sincerely, Hungrymercrunk.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
HungryMrCrunk.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Was that typed on a PSP?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I don't know. This is Hungrymercrunk.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Or your OLR member, Columbia99.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
What was the question?

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
There's only two periods in this whole thing.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Should it get a PSP 3000?

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
No.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Not when you know that this PSP Go is on the horizon.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
I don't think so.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
And the PSP 3000...

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
I wouldn't get either.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000
The PSP 3000 really only had just the microphone built in, basically.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Seriously? Why?

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000
If you really love your PSP, then wait for the PSP Go.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
But if you already have a couple PSPs, which it sounds like you do,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I don't see the point.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Again, this PSP Go is not going to have any additional hardware to it

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
that we know of so far.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I mean, granted, they might come out and say something at E3.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Sure. Buy one. Help the economy.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Well, I love how they're all,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
oh, well, we don't want to add another analog stick to it

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
because then that'll make certain games incompatible.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
You're making them all download anyways,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
so they're going to be incompatible with whatever.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
You know, just have...

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I'd say add the second analog stick

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and that way you can actually do proper emulation

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
on some of these older PlayStation 1 games.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
All right.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So, take our advice or leave it.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Buy one and help the economy.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Ain't my money, so I don't care.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Send your money to me.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Send your money to me, now.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I'll stimulate the economy.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Oh, I bet you will.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Anyway.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Hey, OLR Peepshizzles.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Okay.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:31.000
With all the rumors about the PSP 2 or whatever Sony will call it,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
I was wondering what are your top three features

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
that you want for it.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Ooh, this could be a list list.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I personally would like a larger screen

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
and separate mini USB device that allows you

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
to load your UMD games onto it for playing games

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
that you already own without switching disks.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Also, I would love dual analog sticks.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Much love, someone who dearly loves old people.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Wait a minute.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Didn't we already hear from somebody like that?

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Yes, we did.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
I'm sorry.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I got kicked from IRC in the middle of that question.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Top three features for the PSP Go?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Yeah, that you would want to see.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I want a Tic Tac dispenser.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Made of bacon?

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
No, no.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
I want orange Tic Tacs.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I don't know.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Because they're not going to do much

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
that they're not already doing with the PSP,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
it's so hard to say.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Dude, they may as well add a phone unit on that thing.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
It looks like one anyway.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
The number one thing I want to see

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
is I want to make sure it's easy

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
to download the games and get them on.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I want to see integration with my PC.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I want to see something that when I plug this thing into my PC,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
it has a cool little front-end system like iTunes.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And I got criticized for that earlier by somebody in chat

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
saying iTunes isn't that great.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And they're actually right.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
iTunes is not that great,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
but it still makes managing the device a lot easier

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
than if you didn't have something like that at all.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I'm talking about something pretty for stupid people

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000
that will allow me to manage the content on my PSP.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
That's what I would like more than anything.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Dude, a soccer ball!

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Are you watching Loki playing?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah, I was watching Loki play because he's a soccer ball.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Well, that's my idea.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Loki, do you have anything?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Touch screen would be nice.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
A better web browser.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And...

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Pagle.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
More RAM.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Actually, I think they should add more RAM to it.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Who cares? Just add a more beefy web browser, more RAM,

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
and...

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Yeah.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Touch screen would be nice.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Xlink in chat says porn.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
PSP needs more porn.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
There's plenty of porn out there.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
And plus you can convert it all.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Well, plus the thing gets on the internet, right?

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
That's all the porn you need right there.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Exactly. That's why you need a better web browser.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
It should have a GPS.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
That might be neat.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And it should have...

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
It should have a Tic Tac dispenser and Altoid dispenser.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And apps like the iPhone.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Open-end development.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
And the Tamagotchi.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
That's on my list, too. Open-end development.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000
It should have the little tiger games on there like football.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And all those games.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Alright, we've given more than three.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
This listener should be satisfied.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Okay.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Dear God, whoever wrote a novel...

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Oh, that's act deft.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Okay.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Hi, OLR. This is your friendly and swine flu free neighborhood Mexican act deft.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Can I just say, swine flu, what the hell?

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
People need to stop it.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Stop it with the swine flu garbage.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
More people die from lots of other things.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Like, oh my God.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
And I'll admit at first, if you go back and read my Twitter,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
at first I was kind of like, eh, because I was worried that it was actually going to be an outbreak.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
But like, you know what, more people die from the regular flu.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
It's not as big of a deal as people were making it out to be in the beginning.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Knock it off.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
And you can eat pork and not get swine flu, by the way.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:07.000
It made me want to cry when there was an actual caption on CNN saying you do not get swine flu from eating pig.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
I just think it's an excuse for people to use swine in everyday conversation.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
True story.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000
My uncle is a pig farmer out in Elk Grove, just south of Elk Grove, has a big pig farm.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
He's been on the news twice this week because apparently, I never knew this before,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
he's the president of the National Pork Board, who knew there was one,

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
and he's talking about how this is hurting business.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
They've lost 20% of business since the swine flu thing came out.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I'm going to go get pork chops.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
There you go.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
He actually said on the news, if people will just eat a pork chop a week and some bacon, we'll all be fine.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I'm thinking in the back of my head, boy, Loki's probably sitting there watching this going, no problem.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I'm not sitting there watching. I'm eating pork.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I think all our listeners, unless you are Muslim or Jewish or any other religion that doesn't allow you to eat pork.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Or vegetarian or whatever.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Or vegetarian, whatever.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Go to your local IHOP and order a bacon platter.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
That's right. Please help keep my uncle in business.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Go get some bacon right now.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Go get some bacon.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Unless, you know, Jewish, whatever.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Everyone get together and just do the bacon march and hold up banners that say, bacon does not give you swine flu. Eat up.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Bacon is meat candy.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
H1N1 be damned.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.000
I heart bacon.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Bacon is meat candy.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I need a shirt for ASEN that says I heart bacon.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Can I get that quickly?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I bet you could.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I have a shirt that says I heart bacon.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Can I borrow it for ASEN?

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
No.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Oh, damn you.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
That, of course, was only half one.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
All right.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I'll figure it out.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Hi, OLR.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
This is your, okay, I already read that part.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:44.000
As we may already know, Harmonics is going to release some rock band games to expand the franchise.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Though what I don't get is why people are bitching and whining about it.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.000
First of all, all those that are saying that Harmonics is trying to milk the franchise and are going the way of Activision.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Look at all the Guitar Hero games that have been released and all those to come in the near future.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Guitar Hero Metallica, Smash Hits, Van Halen, On Tour Decades, and the Arcade Game.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Just to name a few.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000
By the way, the movie theater had a Guitar Hero arcade.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Just thought I'd let you know.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Now look at what Harmonics has released or will release at the same time span.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.000
ACDC tracks, Unplugged, The Beatles, Lego Rock Band, and that's it.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Guitar Hero has overloaded the market while Rock Band is expanding its current market.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Not to mention that you can export tracks and play DLC in whatever rock band game with no problem except for The Beatles and Unplugged.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And we don't know about Lego yet.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.000
While with Guitar Hero you have to own every disc to be able to play every song you have on them.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Not to mention changing discs every time you want to play a song that's on another disc.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Yes, I know this isn't a problem for some, but it's still something that would be more quick and useful.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Excuse me.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000
To top it off, people are also asking, why Rock Band Unplugged on the PSP?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Where's the reason on that?

01:55:54.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Well, the reason is that if they had more info on it, they would know it is a spiritual sequel to frequency and amplitude made by Harmonics nonetheless.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:10.000
No instruments, just press the buttons and according to what the track is, and of course, according to the rhythm.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
And the new songs featured on it will be on the Rock Band music store for consoles.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Also, Unplugged will have its own music score, not like Guitar Hero on tour, in which you need the peripheral to play and you can't play on tour on your DSI.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:31.000
And not to mention the awkwardness when you're playing it with N-Node DLC, whatever. Sorry, whatsoever.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000
To sum it all up, Rock Band is not turning into Guitar Hero. Stop bitching about it.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Harmonics knows what they're doing. That was all in caps, but I feel like screaming.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Sorry if this email is a long F you rant, but I need to get it off my chest.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Thanks for reading and for listening to your listeners.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Smile face!

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Happy face!

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.000
You just, you did the smiley, my favorite smiley. Okay.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I agree that Rock Band isn't milking as bad as Guitar Hero, but I worry that it might be going that direction.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
If this Lego thing will not let you import songs, I'm going to be very disappointed.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
It's not going to, it's a different publisher.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
I think that's the only reason-

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Oh my god, my mic wasn't on, I'm sorry.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I was going to say, if this Rock Band will not let you import songs, I'm going to be very disappointed, this Lego one.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I don't think Rock Band has jumped the shark as bad as Guitar Hero.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I'd be surprised if they let you. I think there's going to be too many problems because it's a different publisher.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
But if it were the same publisher, I'm sure they would let you.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Same with the Beatles thing. The Beatles thing, they have a special deal there.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
It's, you know, Beatles only.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000
If they come out with a Rock Band 3, you better believe all that stuff from the other games are going to be, you know, able to be dumped into there.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And you never know, they made surprises with Lego Rock Band.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Maybe they signed some sort of deal that, you know, you can do that.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Maybe you pay, like, so much money and those songs get dumped in there.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I highly doubt it because it's a different publisher, though.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.000
But once again, those are optional. You don't need to buy them.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Whereas, you know, and as we mentioned earlier in Part A, the amount of content they're releasing per week is matching what Guitar Hero is releasing per month.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
That's pretty sad.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
And in place, you're getting these standalone games that you have to spend $60 for.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
No thanks.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
But once again, those are optional, too, so.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Well, also, I want to make a comment, though, about emails. Henceforth, unless I feel, you know, otherwise at the moment.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:21.000
If I get any more emails during the show, I'm probably not going to read them until next week.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000
So, you may as well just understand that.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Yep, good idea.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Anyway, last email comes from Cheeseburger.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Hey guys, sometimes you talk about how you need to stop getting on random tangents. Well, I would just like to say that I would not listen to OLR if not for the personality from each host. Random food, news, and political talk are just random tangents about randomness.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
I've never seen random news so much in a sentence before.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Anyway, that's what makes OLR different from other video game shows.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Just, I'm not in the mood for just straight, sometimes I'm not in the mood for just straight video game news. Sometimes I want a good laugh. Keep on podcasting.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Keep in mind that the bitching about tangents is also part of what makes the show the show.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Yeah.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
So, it all goes hand in hand.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Brought to you by Halo 3, home of the never-ending four-year-old rocket noobs.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
It's over!

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Alright, we're done with the mailbag. That was Mailbag at OrangeLongTrader.com if you want to participate in the future.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000
There you go.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:27.000
By the way, Bobby is typing a monologue in chat right now about the whole Rock Band import.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000
About the Rock Band import songs, you did not import songs from ACDC.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
They gave you a DLC code and you downloaded the songs from Xbox Live or Playstation Network.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
You did not rip them from the disc like Rock Band 1.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
You never had to put the ACDC disc in your 360 to get the ACDC code.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
You just needed the code in the manual.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:50.000
That's why I don't buy the it's a different developer excuse, because ACDC Rock Band was developed by a different developer as well.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I wasn't saying different developer, I'm saying different publisher.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:58.000
That's the deal there. I mean, the developer doesn't really matter if it's going to be in the same series.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.000
It's just like Guitar Hero has been developed by a bunch of different people.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I mean, it's been harmonics for a lot of it, but then now they have...

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
I don't remember the last developer doing the new one.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000
For Guitar Hero? Neversoft.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Neversoft, yeah.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:15.000
So, yeah, it's not developer, it's publisher.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
And because it's a different publisher, it's not EA.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:25.000
If EA was putting it out, then yeah, I'm sure they could do some sort of way to port that stuff over.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:30.000
But because it's Warner, it's a little different. I don't know.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
But also because it's Warner, it may have some good music in it.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Because, I mean, they do have the Warner music license.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
True.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Anyways, kind of a completely off the topic of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
One versus 100. You may remember that they kind of teased this actually last E3.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.000
When they were showing the brand new Xbox interface.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Now, of course, the first primetime game that they're going to be launching is One versus 100.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
And it's going to be available for gold members.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
So you have to have a gold membership in order to play.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Which makes sense because it's an online game.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000
And they want to drive more members to sign up for it.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000
So they have a little teaser trailer for it.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And, of course, you're going to be able to play with your avatars.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Play as part of the mob or the person actually playing the show or as the audience.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
So that looks kind of cool.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
And they're going to be doing where you can win real prizes.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
So, I mean, sounds like fun.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
How do they pick the person that's going to be the one?

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000
I don't know.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
That's interesting.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
I'm curious to see how this is going to work.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Because there's going to be thousands upon thousands of people that want to do this.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
You know what I mean?

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
So they're going to have to have some type of selection process to be the one or even to be one of the folks in the mob.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000
You know what I mean?

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Yeah.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
It's going to be interesting to see how this works.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Unless they have multiple sessions going at one time.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000
But even then, each game is supposed to have their own individual host, right?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Yeah.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
So it'll be interesting to see how it works.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
But I'm sure we'll see more about it at E3.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see more about it, too.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
You think it's not going to release to the network before E3?

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000
It might, actually.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Because this was becoming this month, I thought.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:17.000
That's what I thought, too.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Or last month, April, wasn't it?

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.000
No, it was May.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Oh, May. Interesting.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:24.000
So maybe we'll see it just before E3 and we'll hear about the next game show at E3.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Yeah, maybe.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Or maybe they're going to hold it off until June and announce some more stuff at E3.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I'm afraid of embarrassing myself with my lack of knowledge.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Here's my question. How are they going to prevent people from having a laptop right next to them googling all the answers?

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I don't know.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:39.000
That's what I want to know.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Because one of the questions they show off in the trailer, they're all, you know,

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
the director of 300 also directed what other movie?

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And it's like, you know, Watchmen.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
They gave two other ones, like, really?

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
You don't know who.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Some people wouldn't.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000
A lot of people wouldn't.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Nerds do.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Yes.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
But other people don't.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
No, seriously, you could totally Google that stuff.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Unless you're going to be given, like, a certain time limit or something.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Because it's not going to be like the TV show where you can just sit there going,

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000
Umm, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Tigerclaw says, Didn't 1 vs. 100 get cancelled on TV?

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Yes, it did.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000
SHJ100Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangeonshooter.com says,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:25.000
You were also scored on time, so they can Google it, but they will get a crappy score.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Interesting.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
How's that guy going to play into it on 1 vs. 100?

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I guess I'm going to have to see how it kind of looks.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
So, there you go.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Alright, well, hey, that's not the only game coming out in the future.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Moving on over to the Wii.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
The Wii has a very interesting game coming out.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
It's actually coming out from Sega.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
It's called The Wacky World of Sports.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Because, you know, we didn't have any sports games on the Wii as it is already.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
However, yeah, what's awesome about this,

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Sega, I guess, has released this trailer for it, The Wacky World of Sports.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Furniture racing, card boxing, log cutting, mud sliding,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.000
tuna tossing, cheese rolling, and extreme ironing.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
These are all real sports, too.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
What?

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
These are all real sports from around the world.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Cheese rolling, yeah.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I think I've heard of cheese rolling, but tuna tossing?

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
That sounds dirty.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
That's like toss your cookies.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
That's from New Zealand, I think.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
New Zealand?

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
It's from Australia. It's one of those.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Are they going to have an event for tossing your salad?

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000
No, that's not a sport.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
For some it is.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I'm afraid to say it's not a sport.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000
It's just like DDR will never be a sport.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000
For some it's a sport.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Tossing your salad would be a hobby.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
They don't have any leagues for that, okay?

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I'm sorry.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Well, maybe someone should start one.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Yeah, that'd be a big step backwards there.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I'm just looking forward to extreme ironing.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.000
How is that a sport?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I don't know.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
How is it not a sport, Rob, huh?

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
I don't know.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.000
I could say instead of get back to work, get back to training.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
I'm looking at the trailer here, by the way.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
If you want to know what the noise is, you hear in the background.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Wow.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000
That guy looks like Naruto.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
He does.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
That car just fell apart.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Like Naruto and Wario had a baby.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I think it was towards the end here.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Yeah, the guy's doing the tuna tossing.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
I've seen that.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I've seen the cheese rolling.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
That I've seen before.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
But then they have the extreme ironing here towards the end, which I just did not recognize

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000
at all.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I was like, what the hell is this?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
But they had it.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:37.000
It was someone else that was covering the same story had where that came from.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Actually, I think if you click on some of the links there, they have links to Wikipedia

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
pages.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000
But I think tuna tossing.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Well, here, let me just go to Wikipedia.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
No, I guess so.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Yeah, there's a whole little article here on extreme ironing.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
A performance art in which people take an ironing board to a remote location and iron

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:01.000
items of clothing.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
The latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:15.000
And then, oh my God, there's this person ironing on top of a big rock in the middle of fucking

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
nowhere.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
This is amazing.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I didn't know shit like this existed in the world.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Rob.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
I want to do this.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Everything exists.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
I could be an extreme ironer.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
All I have to do is climb the fucking rock and then iron a shirt at the top of that.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
That's easy.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I do my ironing in a rotating cylindrical container with heat.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
You know what that's called?

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000
My dryer.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Wow, that's pretty cool.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
How about something else that has to do with rolling, Rob?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
They call them ironists.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:50.000
How about more rolling?

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
All right, fine.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Rolling and rolling.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
What is our favorite thing to roll ever?

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Cheese?

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Sushi?

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Cheese.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Money.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
How about Katamari?

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Yay.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Oh yes, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we love Katamari.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Rob.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Rob.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
What?

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Rob.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Rob.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Rob.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
What?

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Rob.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
You're scaring me.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Read your damn story.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Yeah, apparently Spike TV actually has, they do Wild World of Spike and it has, you know,

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
all these different things like tuna.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
They have the tuna toss outtakes.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.000
It's from South Australia.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Sorry, I had to have commentary.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Katamari is going to be on PS3 with Katamari Forever, which I believe we might have mentioned

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
before.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
We mentioned the Japanese one, yeah.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Well, there's a trailer out with different wild animals making commentary on it.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:59.000
The cool thing is that it's going to have different features available for it as far

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
as visual filters.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:07.000
You get a wood grain, a cell shaded, a color pencil, and then the normal version.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Also, this of course has no involvement from Keita Takahashi.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:19.000
But what I got from watching the trailer is that you're actually going to be able to,

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:25.000
well, roll up entire planets and roll up the universe.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
So, that's kind of interesting.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I saw it rolling up, you know, the earth.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
It was pretty crazy.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Didn't they swear there was not going to be any more Katamari games?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.000
I guess that was really the original creator, but now that Namco Bandai owns this franchise.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Well, this is the best of it.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:41.000
It's not new.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
It's just taking the levels from the other game.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
It's still milk in the cash cow.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
There's actually...

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Any way you want to slice it.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Looking at the trailers, there's new levels.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:55.000
There actually shows one where you're rolling the Katamari and planting flowers and plants

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
on a desert.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000
I just think that series kind of peaked on the PlayStation 2.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Like, I did not like that one they released on the 360 at all.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000
It's almost like it's going to be fun.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Eh, we'll see.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.000
We'll see.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
But do you know what else I'd like to roll, Dark Sakura?

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Because you were asking about things we like to roll.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Do you know what else I'd like to roll?

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I don't need to know about your illegal activities, Rob.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:30.000
No, I just wanted to tell you one other thing I like to roll.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I'm successful at life, thank you very much.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Yes.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
You win the game.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I just won the game.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I mean, I know a lot of people lose the game, but they never talk about how somebody wins

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
the game, and I just won it.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
So, there's no need to play the game anymore.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
I won.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
The end.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I thought about you winning the game.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
See, you didn't think about it.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000
So I guess I would.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
That's right.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
So, yeah.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Lots of interesting stuff going on.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Including, Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe is actually coming to the PSP.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000
You know, we've been talking about a lot of different games coming to the PSP.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:17.000
This might be the year of the PSP, although last year was supposedly the year of the PSP

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
as well.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Of course, it wasn't quite a year for the PSP, but whatever.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
We'll give it another shot.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Take two.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Anyways, Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe coming to the PSP.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:34.000
They're going to have some new stages, new enemies, new tracks, or music tracks.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Two new towers will also be introduced to the game as well, but it's basically going

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:45.000
to feature the same stuff, including trophies from the original PSN game.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
So that's kind of cool.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Everyone loves their tower defense games.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.000
I guess, although they've kind of been jumping the shark as of late.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
It seems like they all have one, especially the Final Fantasy tower defense game.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Although it's kind of fun, I've got to say.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
That's on every system.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Pixel Junk and so on and so on.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I don't know.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Well, obviously Swine Flu has been all the rage this week.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I can't believe I'm reading this story.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
But Swine Flu has been all the rage this week.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
But did you know that Swine Flu has actually existed in the World of Warcraft

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
for quite some time?

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
That's right.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.000
World of Warcraft has seen the Swine Flu for a little while now,

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
ever since they released Wrath of the Lich King.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.000
It's these pigs in Borean Chandra, which is in the new area of Northren.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
If you attack these pigs, you have a chance of getting infected.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000
And if you get infected with the Swine Flu, your movement speed drops by 30%,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.000
and you get hit with 120 natural damage every two seconds.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
So if you happen to catch the Swine Flu in Warcraft this week,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
it's not a joke that was put in there by the developers.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
It's something that's been there the entire time.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
So stop bitching if you get it.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.000
So it's really Blizzard that has caused the Swine Flu.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Yes, it was Blizzard's fault all along.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
And the fact that I'm even talking about this story makes me cry inside a little bit.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
And when I get hurt by the stories that we read,

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.000
that makes us very angsty, and that's when the FUs of the Week happen.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
DarkSakura, your FUs of the Week, please.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000
My FU goes to Citrus Heights cops, just in general,

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000
they really like to find reasons to give you a ticket.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:35.000
I had one tailgating me, well, practically tailgating me on the way here,

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
I guess waiting for me to speed or something,

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:42.000
and thankfully someone decided to jaywalk right in front of us,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.000
so the cop turned on the sirens and got the jaywalker.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Still, a bit, I don't know if you have enough to do or something.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Logi! Yeah, FU goes to, I guess, police as well.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000
It's kind of funny though, you see them turn on their sirens or whatever,

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
and see who pulls over to the side and they give them a ticket.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:09.000
I'm not sure why, you know, not necessarily people speeding,

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:14.000
but people think that they want to pull over and then they get a ticket for some reason.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000
I don't get a ticket though, because I can see them sitting there.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
That's it.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Am I the only one that doesn't have police issues this week?

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Well, I didn't really have anything other than driving to Oakland sucks.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.000
FU did the fact that everything seems to close at like 10 o'clock in this city.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Like, I was out in Roseville last night trying to find some late night eats

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.000
and everything was freaking closed, so FU did stores that close early.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
It's annoying. Oh, I'm sorry, Logi.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:53.000
FU did the finale of Heroes. It sucked, and what they did with the villain in the series is retarded.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Interesting. I'm eight episodes behind on Heroes. I kind of gave up.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.000
You're gonna... Don't expect a good finale.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Oh, great. Maybe I'll watch it during the summer. We'll see. I'll catch up at some point.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Alright, FU to Logi for not finishing his FUs, and I get my FU early.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week. No guests tonight to keep the segment going,

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.000
so we've got a little more news, about four more stories for you guys,

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
and then we are going to get into your Skype calls and some last minute stories.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, but not yet. We have a few more stories. Talk Sakura.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Well, there is a teaser that was put out on the Pokemon Sunday TV show that's on TV course in Japan,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:42.000
and they were saying that there would be a remake of Pokemon Gold and Silver.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.000
This said that they would have a world exclusive first announcement on the 10th of May,

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:58.000
so maybe that's it. It could be a rumor, but they were showing gold and silver confetti balls,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.000
so that could possibly be it.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I didn't want to see their gold balls. Wherever they can milk for money, they will.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Ooh, Scorpion.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000
You've got to put the game down, Logi.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
You can watch Logi play Excitebots in between stories at our Justin TV channel,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.000
www.justin.tv slash orange lounge radio.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Also, keeping on topic with more PSP games, Naruto Shippuden is putting a brand new fighting game

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000
following that series. Coming to the PSP, it actually kind of resembles the Naruto game

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000
that came out on the PS3 last year, which is not a bad thing at all,

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
because that game was pretty awesome looking.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:54.000
But, Naruto Shippuden Legends Akatsuki Rising.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:00.000
I guess it's going to feature a simplified control scheme that will allow players to easily create ultimate combos.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I don't know, it looks kind of cool, but definitely they have a pretty solid lineup for PSP games this year,

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.000
so more power to them, because they have a lot of catching up to do.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Is this related to all the other Naruto games in the world?

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Shippuden is basically what people are referring to as the time jump.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
He's a little bit older, but they've been doing the Shippuden games,

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
like they did Ultimate Ninja 4, which is Shippuden,

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:42.000
and then they have a new Shippuden game for the DS that's coming out next month, I think.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:47.000
This one's going to be another fighting game, because they've been doing PSP, Naruto Ultimate Ninja games,

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:56.000
like the Ultimate Ninja Heroes series, but now, going along with the whole Shippuden stuff, why not?

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
It looks pretty good.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Alright, well, a couple more new games that are coming out in the future.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
This is going to be coming out on the DS this winter.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
If you're a fan of the Phoenix Wright series, which I guess you could really call the Ace Attorney series,

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000
there's a new game coming out called Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
It's not going to be like the other games.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
This is more about investigating the crime scene, not so much in the courtroom.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:25.000
You're actually going to become Miles Edgeworth, and you're going to investigate crime scenes, trying to find the truth.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
So it's a weird CSI type thing.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I guess. You're actually going to be on the crime scene as Edgeworth, looking for contradictions.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000
You identify clues and question material using logic and gathered evidence.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Of course, there are several episodes in this game as well.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:43.000
The first one is a murder that happens in Edgeworth's office. Interesting.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:49.000
By the way, this game is teen rated, and it's supposed to have 15 hours' worth of gameplay.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.000
So I'm sure those of you that are fans of the Ace Attorney series will be happy about that,

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
although the game is going in a little bit of a different direction this time.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Hopefully not for the bad.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Well, speaking of bad as in badass, Raven Software is actually wanting to make a particular game since they've been...

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.000
And of course, they were the ones that made the X-Men Origins Wolverine game.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
They want to do a Deadpool game.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
They really want to do a Deadpool game, it says.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:26.000
And actually, their project lead for the Wolverine game, Dan Von Drak, said that they really want to do it because of Deadpool's smartass attitude.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:32.000
And if they made one, I will buy it on every platform. Just watch.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Just on principle alone, even though it might suck?

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:41.000
Well, if the X-Men Origins game was pretty good, then I would expect them to give the Deadpool game a good treatment.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
So, hey, I'm feeling good about that.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Now, do we have any word yet on whether you will be able to break the fourth wall in this game?

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000
You have to. It won't be a Deadpool game if you don't break the fourth wall.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.000
There should be a button to smash the fourth wall.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.000
He should know he's in a video game.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
So, it's gonna be like, eat lead?

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know. But that's the big thing about Deadpool, like comic people.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I did not know this. I actually read up on Deadpool after seeing the Wolverine movie to figure out why Jamie was so obsessed with Deadpool.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000
And I get it now. Like, it sounds like a very Jamie thing from what I read.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000
I'm gonna have to just send you some images that you'll know.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:25.000
You saw the little yellow boxes picture. That's like Ultimate right there.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:31.000
But, by the way, the article that I'm reading actually did compare what they imagined as being like, eat lead.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Nice.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Alright, well, guess what? It's that time of the show where we're gonna take your phone calls.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
And the phones are already ringing in a 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, so let's go to the phones.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio. Who's this?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Hey, it's been a while since I've been on here.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
It has been a little while. Who is this?

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Hey, it's DJ Rama S from New York.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Now, see, I knew that, but I always make people introduce themselves for the sake of new listeners.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Well, what's on your mind, DJ Rama S from New York?

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Not too much. I have a couple questions, but first, Loki, congratulations.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Thank you.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.000
You're welcome.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:10.000
You weren't able to get through last week when, of course, it was announced that Loki's looking at twins in the future.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Fun, fun.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Yeah.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.000
So, what's up?

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:21.000
My only qualm was about Konami canceling Six Days in Fallujah.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
That's my only beef.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
What's your problem with it?

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
This is the way I look at it.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:32.000
If it's okay to have various World War II simulating fighting games,

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I don't see how that's any different from Six Days in Fallujah,

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
or that's any different from the America's Army game.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:42.000
I mean, they're all more or less based on real-time events.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
But it's too soon.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
People we know died there. It's too soon.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
It's too soon for this.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
The wounds are too fresh.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
I applied the Dennis Leary quote to this.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Shut the fuck up, by Dr. Dennis Leary.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I agree.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I'm just being devil's advocate here.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I don't say I necessarily believe this, but what do you say to those people?

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Besides, shut the fuck up.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.000
You can't say that to, you know, somebody who's, I guess maybe you can,

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
but it's not a very nice thing to say.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
I mean, is there anything else to say besides?

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:15.000
Let me ask this, why should they shut the fuck up?

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Me personally, I'm just tired of hearing about it.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
I mean, you've got people who are over there that are fighting

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
who are actually all for the game.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
They want their experiences in it.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:31.000
They're over there doing what they have to do for us to do what we have to do here.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I feel that this is their game.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
They earned this. Let them have it.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:40.000
If people don't want to see it, then they just don't have to buy it.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Exactly.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Isn't it interesting that Konami might take more flak over not releasing this game

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:49.000
than they would have if they had released it?

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.000
One way or another, it'll be released, you know.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:57.000
If not, someone's going to release a beta for everyone to go play, you know.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.000
I mean, you know, it'll leak. It'll get pirated.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Isn't that the inevitable?

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
That's always the case.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Not too much. I'm just glad that you guys got all the parts for the new studio PC.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.000
They are all here.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Sadly, we haven't put it together yet.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Just the timing hasn't worked out.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I kind of figured.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Yeah, Loki's going to do it during our break next week

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
so that when we come back, we'll be on an all-new computer.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:28.000
So maybe we'll try to find some other new things to show off next week after a little break.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Which we've been taking a lot of breaks this year.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
I feel bad, but you know what?

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
It happens.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
You guys earned it. I mean, really.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:40.000
You know, the guy before us very rarely takes a break,

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
so it always makes us look so terrible because he's always here.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000
He rarely takes breaks.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
I think like once every four years, he might take a break.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Speaking of breaks, when are you going to be breaking to New York?

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
It's a possibility for later this year.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:00.000
I really want to get back there, but it's just because I promised ASEN I would do that sometime.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:03.000
I'm doing that this year, and that's going to be a chunk of money.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:06.000
And then, you know, I still really want to do PAX and E3.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
That's just going to set me back financially.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I still really want to try and do New York in the fourth quarter,

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000
and if things continue to go well for me in my day job and everything,

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.000
and I don't have any worries about the economy or anything like that,

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I'm hoping to do New York in the fourth quarter of the year, like maybe October again.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
That would be awesome.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:28.000
And on behalf of the New York Unwell Army, we have one request if you make it out this way.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Okay.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Pack Jamie and the suitcase with you.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
I'll do what I can.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:37.000
If I had the money for it, I would be happy to, but as it is,

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I've had to already call off one trip that I was going to make at the end of this month,

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:47.000
and having to put in extra massage time just to save up for a trip in two months.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:52.000
So I'm broke. I'm flat broke. School is wiping me out.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
I guess I should say this.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Sadly, Dark Soccer is not going to be doing E3 with us, which is unfortunate,

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:02.000
but real life, greater than radio show.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Trust me, I really wanted to come back out there this year.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Again, I really wanted to.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Well, we'll make it work somehow.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Then we'll have the economy set us back a little bit,

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:18.000
but hopefully things will start to pick up, and then 2010 we'll have lots of visits.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
You come here, I'll go there, we'll have a lot of fun.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
So we're like an exchange program.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.000
And I'll give in, and I might even go to Atlanta for Bobby and go to a Friday night gaming show.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Well, I will be down in Atlanta this year, so.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Will you really? For what, a convention or something?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Yeah, my company, we may be doing Dragon Con this year.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Oh, nice.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Well, if you're going to be there for Dragon Con,

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I doubt Bobby's going to be there with his Friday night gaming shindig,

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000
but if you happen to be there on a weekend and he's doing that, you should go say hi.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I know he likes to see the visitors out there.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I'm sorry, the name of the town escapes me that they tape in.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Oh, I'm bad.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.000
What?

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:59.000
The name of the town that Bobby tapes Friday night gaming in is not Atlanta.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
It's one of the suburbs.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:02.000
I think that's where he lives.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Is it Marietta?

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
It's Marietta?

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
He'll correct me in a minute here, I'm sure.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Anyway, Rama, is there anything else you wanted to say on the show tonight?

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Oh, he hung up.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Did I accidentally click and hang up on him? I hope not.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.000
All right.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Well, we're going to go ahead and take some more calls.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Sorry, Rama, if I hung up on you, I didn't mean to.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.000
You can go ahead and give us a call, and we'll be standing by waiting for your call.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
And actually, our internet went down in studio.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
That's why we lost DJ Rama.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Is anybody online doing?

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.000
I don't do anything.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Nobody's doing anything?

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Okay, well, right now it is trying to reconnect right now.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000
We went down.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Oh, there we go.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Woo.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Roswell is the town that they tape in.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I'm still on.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
There we go.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I'm sorry.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I got it back, but the stream is down right now, unfortunately.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.000
So can we post that in chat that the stream is down but Skype is still open?

02:25:58.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Hold on.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
All right.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.000
So, yeah, we unfortunately have that outage right now, but that's what happens sometimes with live radio.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Things go down.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Okay, good.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Stream's back up.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Hooray.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:12.000
All right.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
1877 Game OLR.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Give us a call.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
We'll take some calls.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.000
If you can't get through, keep trying.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:26.000
That little spurt of downtime we might have just had could have affected the calls.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Okay.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I think we're getting calls again.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Hi.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:30.000
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Who's this?

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000
This is Spazinator.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Hi.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
You're breaking up there a little bit.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Who is this?

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Spazinator.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Hi, Spazinator.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.000
What's on your mind?

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Yeah.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Well, I did these earlier, but apparently I sent the email a little bit too late, so

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.000
more or less I was going to repeat a couple of questions.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Yeah.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:04.000
And they're more or less directed towards you since you got your position through in

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
a few months or so.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Basically, although I was-

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I just want to point out the connection is still really bad, but go ahead and ask your

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
questions and we'll try to answer them.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.000
I don't know if we can stay on, but keep going with your questions.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Yeah.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Basically, do you have any overall impressions of the PlayStation 3?

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Overall impression of the PlayStation 3?

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000
It's very similar to how I feel about the PSP.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Is that the- God, now I'm having problems in the chat room as well.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Jeez, I don't know what's going on with the connection tonight.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
My PlayStation 3, I feel very similar with the PSP.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Its biggest forte is not games, but it does a lot of the other things very well.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Like, you know, it's got the Blu-ray, which is great for movies.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.000
It can play the digital files very well and very easy.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.000
It seems like it's almost easier than Xbox.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:02.000
You know, the internet browsing on it is better than it is on the Wii.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:05.000
It has some cool little built-in things for the CD music.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.000
So it's kind of like, it's not my favorite of the gaming systems.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I think my Xbox 360 is my favorite gaming system.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.000
But I love the fact that it's quiet and I think that it's kind of,

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I don't think it's a bad system at all.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I just wish they get some better exclusives.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000
But they do have some games I love, like Little Big Planet.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:32.000
And also, in terms of the multi-platform games out there,

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:39.000
do you ever have a difficult time trying to pick and choose

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000
which system you're going to get the game for,

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.000
especially if there's no real difference between, let's say,

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.000
the 360 version and the PlayStation 3 version?

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I have been in that situation before.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Street Fighter 4 was the last time I had to make that decision

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
because I pretty much swore up and down to myself

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I was going to get Street Fighter 4 on PlayStation 3

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
because PlayStation 3 had the better controller

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
and I knew I'd be able to pull off the moves easier on the controller.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Damn, I wish Microsoft would fix that.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.000
As opposed to doing all this motion controller BS that they're starting,

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:11.000
I really wish they would just fix the controller they've got

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
and make that D-pad easier.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
But anyhow, I ended up getting it on the 360

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:19.000
because I thought Microsoft can fix their controller later on.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:22.000
And just more people are on the 360 playing it.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:25.000
You know, I can go on Xbox Live and there's way more people playing it,

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:29.000
whereas on my PlayStation 3 friends list there's not nearly as many people, you know?

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Yeah, completely unrelated topic.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I finally found something that's far, far worse than being Rick Rolled.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Uh-oh, what's that?

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:49.000
It's kind of similar to being Rick Rolled where someone sends you a wake

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:53.000
just saying it's one thing, and it turns out to be something else.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.000
As long as it's not that two girls, one cup crap.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:01.000
No, actually there is a girl involved.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Maybe you're kind of familiar with the story

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.000
because apparently it occurred out your way.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Apparently some girl in California

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.000
died on Halloween Day two years ago

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:20.000
and some cop released an accident in a photo.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Someone sent me a wake.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
That's disgusting.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Why do people have to perpetuate that stuff?

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I feel like it's violating someone's privacy to do that kind of crap.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
I just think it's disgusting.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.000
I realize everybody has their morbid curiosity, but please,

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
it's kind of disrespecting to this gal or whatever.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Anyway, Spaznator, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Have a good one?

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Yep.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
All right, and if you want to call, give us a call.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
What's 1-877-GAME-OLR?

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
We'll take a couple more calls here tonight,

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000
and then we're going to wrap things up.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
DS Master 26.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Well, hello DS Master 26. What's on your mind tonight?

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Not much other than, well, the whole guitar hero versus rock band debate.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:22.000
It's kind of unraveling for me because, I mean, what the heck?

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:30.000
You know, I've heard my friends at the Hanna Club kind of rumor again and again at some point.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:41.000
They're probably knowing how Konami teamed up with Disney a bunch of times to get the Disney DDRs and whatever.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Are you saying that you're afraid this is going to go the route of the DDRs

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
or that it's not such a bad thing because there's been so many DDRs with the Disney and all that stuff?

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:53.000
You know, probably to expand our audience.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:59.000
I mean, I guess it could work, but, I mean, the Wii was a family system to begin with.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:07.000
So, I'm thinking of just bringing it in at 360 anyways if I'm doing guitar hero stuff

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.000
and using it for Ben and using the Wii for everything else.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:18.000
You know, that's an interesting correlation, though, when you consider the whole Lego rock band

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000
and how it's supposed to be kind of the more kiddie-friendly game.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:26.000
It would be interesting to kind of correlate that with the fact that they have the Disney Dance Dance Revolution games

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.000
that are more geared at a younger audience, too.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Yeah, I mean, I could see that being a little bit of a competition sense.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I mean, but at the only...

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I think you're breaking up there. Hello?

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Morning.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Okay, unfortunately, the caller's breaking up.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.000
I don't know, it must be us having internet problems.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
It's Comcast-ic tonight, folks.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.000
What can we say?

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Dude, my internet's been crap all day at home, and I am with Comcast.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:03.000
We have been having issues here in the area, like when the rain started and all that stuff,

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
so I don't know what the hell's going on.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000
So I apologize to folks.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Well, let's try to get one more call. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:12.000
1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Go ahead and give us a call.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
See, the chat room stopped again, and I'm wondering if that means...

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Do we crap out on... No?

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
We're still broadcasting.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Jeez.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Just to be on the safe side, since we're toward the end, I closed all my browsers.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:29.000
I think I pinged out a chat, so I don't think...

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Yeah, I'm not...

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:34.000
So we can't see it. No, and the stream went down on top of all that.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Boy, what a fun, fun time we're having tonight.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Everybody sure they're not downloading anything? Is my roommate...

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I'm not downloading anything.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Is my roommate doing anything? I hope not.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000
He should know.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:46.000
He's watching TV.

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
That's what he usually does during the show, so I don't know what's going on.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000
All right, well, we'll try to get one more call. Again, 1877-GAME-OLR.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Our username is SkyPornsLoungeRadio.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Do we have any last-minute news while we wait? Last-minute stories?

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Sure.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Okay.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
DarkSoccer, why don't you start us off with some last-minute stories?

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I like pie.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Loki.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Actually got some stuff.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Ultima Online is actually bringing out a new expansion.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
The Stygania Abyss, I guess.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:17.000
And apparently it will allow you to play as a new class, the Gargoyle class.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:23.000
And you'll also be able to explore the new Gargoyle home of Turmer

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.000
and the Stygania Abyss, I guess, dungeon,

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.000
which is the largest dungeon area ever introduced into Ultima Online.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000
That's pretty cool.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I can't believe that Ultima Online is still alive and kicking after all these years.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
That's pretty impressive in itself.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Yes.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Oh, yes.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.000
All right. Well, hello, caller. You're on the air.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
You're supposed to wait for me to acknowledge you.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
What's up, everybody? There's Zaku.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Hi, Zaku. What's on your mind, buddy, while we're having crappy internet problems tonight?

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Nothing much.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Just praying that the street doesn't go down again

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
and just enjoying the fact that me and my brother have the house to ourselves

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000
because Mom's on vacation in Peru.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000
So what's on your mind?

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
What do you have possession to call in tonight?

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:09.000
You're just bragging that you have the house all to yourself.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Hello? God damn it.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Hello, are you there?

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Caller, are you there?

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
We lost another one.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Okay, we're going to turn off Justin TV and hope that that will help things.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000
So, boy, oh, boy.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.000
I guess it's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I want to dump the end of the show.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Oh, well, that happens sometimes, guys.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:39.000
If Zaku can get his question out in chat, we'll try to answer it, guys.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
If you want to get your questions out in chat, we'll try to answer them

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000
while Loki gets some last minute stories out of the way.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
You could just do Ask Gordon's Lounge or something like that.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Maybe.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Mr. T and Will Wright are teaming up against Nazis in a new Zootfly game.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Zootfly, you may remember, is the company.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Originally they were pitching the Ghostbusters game,

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
and they've also done some other stuff beyond that.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:05.000
But now they're making a Mr. T game.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Mr. T.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000
What?

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Yes, he will take on Nazis.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Will you tell people to get nuts?

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Apparently the first game will see Mr. T take on Nazis

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:19.000
and their gigantic machines in a varied universe of South American rainforests,

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:25.000
lost ancient cities, industrial complexes, and contemporary military installations.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Along with Mr. T and other characters from the graphic novel,

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:31.000
the game will feature none other than Will Wright.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:34.000
In this universe, Will Wright is a top-notch game designer,

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:45.000
but a top-notch American geneticist who was kidnapped and coerced to work on a diabolic plan,

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.000
and Mr. T and Will Wright will join forces to annihilate the Nazis and their hardware.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Who was smoking crack when they thought of this?

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:54.000
That's an awesome game.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I bet you anything they saw the Snickers commercials with Mr. T.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000
It does sound all kinds of awesome, don't get me wrong, but jeez.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000
All right, by the way, for the live listeners, we've been going up and down.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:09.000
We killed Justin.tv to try and free up some bandwidth in case that was our problem,

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
but it didn't seem to help on that last call.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:15.000
So we are aware JTV is down. We've taken it down completely.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:18.000
And yeah, we're just trying to finish up the show at this point.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.000
We just turned off Skype because the calls just aren't cooperating tonight.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
I don't know what's going on, guys.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
All of our configurations are fine on our end.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.000
There's no cable problems. Nothing's falling apart.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:31.000
No video card issues. It's something on the Comcast.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:38.000
And then there was an update to Nobby Nobby Boy, which apparently added the 4-Boy offline multiplayer mix.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000
In addition, there's a new boy that you get to play as, Fart Boy.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.000
What?

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Yes, Fart Boy.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Is that his given name?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:49.000
That is his given name, Fart Boy.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:55.000
As well as, I guess, the lower key updates, they have variations to the boy's house hairstyles

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:59.000
and new poses to the game's bird.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:02.000
That's awesome.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Then we were talking a little bit about the rumors of the PSP Go.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Well, there's a new game coming from Capcom, Fate Unlimited.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:16.000
They're going to put that actually on...

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:19.000
It's going to be download only in Europe.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.000
But apparently Capcom is releasing on the UMD elsewhere.

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:31.000
So they're kind of testing that whole thing to see if people actually buy the download content only games.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000
I don't know.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Maybe it is a sign of things to come.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
What do you think is going to happen if the answer is no?

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
They don't.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
They're fucked.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
They've invested all this in the PSP Go thing.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Well, I heard the rumor about the PSP Go is that the design is not finalized yet,

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:50.000
and so they could add the UMD drive if necessary.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I think it would be a good idea if they were...

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I mean, what's the point in taking it out?

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Other than UMD is a failed format, but they're still using it.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Who cares?

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
I don't know.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Whatever.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:07.000
And then finally, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been confirmed to be coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:10.000
and PlayStation Network this summer.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.000
And then also, they had a PS3 demo that came out this week, actually.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:17.000
So if you want to check that out, you can.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000
And of course, that was that countdown that they had going.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:25.000
They're going to have, apparently, all 56 characters will be unlocked from the beginning.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:31.000
And they're going to also feature, I guess, some HD upscaling,

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:38.000
as well as widescreen options and custom soundtracks on both the PS3 and Xbox 360.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:43.000
And they also have three different screen modes that you can do.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:53.000
You can do just the classic pixelated look, and then they have a smooth and a crisp look that you can do.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:58.000
And finally...

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.000
I just want to say for the live listeners, while the stream is up,

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:05.000
I have double-checked everything in the house, including what's going on with my roommate and everything.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
We don't know what's going on with the stream right now,

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000
so we're just going to try and limp our way through the end of the show at this point.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
We're almost there.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Sorry, guys.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.000
There's been a picture of the homebrew enabler on the PSP-3000 working,

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:27.000
so it's only a matter of time before the custom firmware is on the PSP-3000, so that's interesting.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000
And finally, we were talking a little bit about Wolverine Origins, the video game.

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Well, apparently, since Activision is fun like that, and Blizzard likes doing all sorts of crazy stuff,

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:45.000
they've hidden a lot of little Easter eggs in the game, including references to Portal.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.000
They have a surprise cake that you can get that unlocks the achievement.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:55.000
And also, they even have the Frostmourne from World of Warcraft as well in there

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:00.000
that you can get an achievement that's titled Wow.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Wow.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Amazing.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
So lots of little hidden goodies.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:11.000
All right, well, we're going to go around and wrap up the show, get everybody's final thoughts.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:19.000
I want animal-style fries and a milkshake.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:24.000
My final thought is I hate internet problems that you can't explain.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Loki?

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:31.000
My final thought is actually this story from Destructoid talking about Yahoo.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Apparently, remember last week we talked a little bit about how ThinkGeek was selling Dreamcast systems for $99?

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Well, apparently, somebody at Yahoo decided to report that according to the internet,

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:51.000
the Dreamcast is being re-released to compete with the PlayStation 2 because of the price drop to $99.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Somebody needs to do their research.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
That's it.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:01.000
All right, well, thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and downloading

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:06.000
and especially the live listeners who stuck with us through the ups and downs of the connections tonight.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Don't know what's going on. The internet's crazy like that sometimes.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:12.000
But thank you guys for staying with us, especially those of you on the podcast,

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.000
for downloading and supporting independent radio. We really appreciate it.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.000

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.000
and so we'll see you back here on May 17th with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:25.000
