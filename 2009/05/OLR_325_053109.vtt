00:00.000 --> 00:20.360
Today, May 31, 2009, the PSP Go gets confirmed a bit early, Matrix Online decides to pull

00:20.360 --> 00:29.760
the plug, and on the eve of the expo we go over all the E3 leaks and rumors.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.240
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
Radio.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.600
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:40.600 --> 00:41.600
lifestyle.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.820
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.

00:43.820 --> 00:48.040
Say hello as well to my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.860
How are you doing?

00:50.860 --> 00:52.000
At least you have a voice.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.720
My voice is leaving, I had a busy weekend.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.280
I should make you some coffee or some tea or something.

00:57.280 --> 00:58.640
Coffee would be awesome actually.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.080
Why don't I make some coffee?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.080
That would be super.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.680
I will do that after I announce my gaming week.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.480
Yeah, I was going to say, we're trying to do a show right now, so maybe we'll get into

01:05.480 --> 01:06.480
that in a little bit.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.480
I will, I will use my sensio.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
Awesome.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.480
Awesome.

01:10.480 --> 01:16.040
I can't wait for hot coffee, fresh from DarkSakura.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.280
On second thought, go get yourself.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.580
Also say hello to TechMasterLoki who has a thread on his shirt that's bugging the hell

01:21.580 --> 01:22.580
out of me.

01:22.580 --> 01:23.580
There it is.

01:23.580 --> 01:25.080
Why did she do that?

01:25.080 --> 01:27.080
Should I put it back?

01:27.080 --> 01:28.080
No.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.080
I see.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.080
How are you?

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
That's what wives are supposed to do.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.080
How are you, TechMasterLoki?

01:32.080 --> 01:33.080
I'm doing fine.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.080
Yeah?

01:34.080 --> 01:35.080
That's what I try to do.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.080
Been busy.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.080
I think your mic is off, Loki.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.080
I'm not.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.080
That's right, I turned it off.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.080
There you go.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
I forgot that I did that too.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.080
Oh, well, welcome back.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.840
Apparently you're gone one week and you forget how the damn show works.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.840
Yes.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
Just kidding.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
All right, so how are you doing, Loki?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.400
I've been busy.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Yes, been busy?

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
Getting ready for E3?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
Uh, no.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.400
No.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
Me neither.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.120
I am so not ready for E3, which is actually why I'm kind of excited that I don't have

01:57.120 --> 01:58.440
a lot of commitments.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.800
The great thing about you and I, and unfortunately Dark Soccer can't go this year, but hopefully

02:02.800 --> 02:04.200
next year she can go again.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.240
The great thing about us going to E3 is that we don't answer to nobody.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.240
We only answer to you guys, the listeners, really direct what we do.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.200
And we don't answer to them either.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.160
Sometimes we decide not to listen to them either.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.160
No, I'm kidding.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.160
I'm kidding.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.760
But I mean, if we're going to let anybody boss us around, it's the listeners.

02:20.760 --> 02:21.980
You know what I mean?

02:21.980 --> 02:27.880
We don't have anybody to, you know, nobody pays us to cover or write or edit video or

02:27.880 --> 02:28.880
any of that stuff.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
And why not?

02:29.880 --> 02:30.880
We just kind of get to do whatever.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Someone should pay us.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.880
Well, but if they did, then we'd have that responsibility.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.120
And I kind of like the fact that we're going to E3 as gamers to just soak it all in, see

02:40.120 --> 02:43.680
what interests us outside of all the media hype.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.320
Maybe we're going to find something in a dark corner somewhere that gets half a page

02:47.320 --> 02:52.000
right up on sites that are way overlooked and all the PSP Go and whatever other news

02:52.000 --> 02:53.360
is going to come out of E3.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.720
And you know, we can focus on that.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.880
And that's going to be the cool thing about E3, I think this year.

02:57.880 --> 03:03.080
Because right now, I have to admit you guys, E3 this year, I'm not feeling it as much as

03:03.080 --> 03:04.480
I have in years past.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.760
And I know there's a lot of people that are like, you effing bastard.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.720
You know, I have always wanted to go to E3.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.720
And you're sitting there going, well, I'm going to E3, but I don't feel kind of half

03:13.720 --> 03:15.000
asked about it this year.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.900
From my perspective, in my defense a little bit, you know, this used to be a big deal.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.480
Like everybody I knew, knew went to E3.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.740
And this year, like not even, I think it's the economy plays a big part in it.

03:27.740 --> 03:28.960
Not even Dark Soccer is going.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.140
One of our own hosts here on the show is not able to go to the show.

03:32.140 --> 03:35.660
And like, you know, it's a choice not to go to the show, right?

03:35.660 --> 03:40.680
And none of my friends, you know, outside of the three of us are really going except

03:40.680 --> 03:45.480
for some of my long distance friends like Bobby and, you know, Kropotkin and some of

03:45.480 --> 03:48.280
the, you know, All Games people are going to be there.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.960
But I'm talking about, you know, some of my local friends, there used to be like 10 of

03:50.960 --> 03:52.640
us that would go and none of them are going.

03:52.640 --> 03:54.960
So it's kind of weird this year.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.320
I'm going to feel a little lonely at E3.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.520
So if you happen to be going to E3, I might need a hug because I'm feeling a little lonely

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
this year.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.520
All right, everyone.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
Yay.

04:05.520 --> 04:08.160
And you know how we used to have the kick in UltraCade?

04:08.160 --> 04:09.160
This is a hug-a-rob.

04:09.160 --> 04:16.400
So everyone go around, hug Rob, post your pictures to pixx.com.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.360
And just remind me that I don't have to be alone.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.760
Give Rob some love before he cries like an emo child.

04:22.760 --> 04:27.440
I don't know why I'm feeling weird about E3 this year, but I know, you know what, it's

04:27.440 --> 04:28.440
going to be the same as every year.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.340
I'm going to get to LA and I'm going to have a blast.

04:30.340 --> 04:35.840
You know, because this, you guys have to understand, you know, I'm a normal gamer person just like

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
the rest of you.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
Don't get paid to do this stuff.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.840
I don't understand, Rob.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.600
It's just, it's one of those things where I do this all the time with trips.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.800
Even right before I went to ASEN, Chicago, I was like dragging my feet.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.360
Like, why the hell did I sign up to do this?

04:47.360 --> 04:48.480
Why am I going to Chicago?

04:48.480 --> 04:49.520
Oh my God.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.080
Like I'm just, this is just getting in the way right now.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.160
I don't have, and then once the plane landed, I was like, woo, I'm in another city.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
I'm having fun.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.280
You know, I'm meeting so many new people.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.280
But what?

05:00.280 --> 05:01.840
You have lesbians to hang out with.

05:01.840 --> 05:05.600
I know, and I got to see the lesbians there, but the lesbians aren't going to E3.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.720
How is E3 supposed to be any fun without lesbians?

05:08.720 --> 05:09.720
Hopefully there's some lesbians at E3 somewhere.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.720
Every convention needs more gay.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.840
I need a hug from lesbians at E3.

05:12.840 --> 05:13.840
That's what I need.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.120
Every convention is better with more gay.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.320
Enough of my whining.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.320
Let me introduce the chat room as well.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.440
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.800
And look, I got a hug from Retertainment already in chat.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.800
A nice virtual hug.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.880
Well, thank you guys very much.

05:25.880 --> 05:30.040
And from Milma13120 as well.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.120
So hooray for hugs and hooray for new people.

05:32.120 --> 05:36.160
I see a lot of people in the chat that I have not seen before, so I think we have some new

05:36.160 --> 05:37.160
listeners.

05:37.160 --> 05:41.520
I think CyberBeast41 I think was saying he's in Belgium and listening for the first time.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.680
So welcome.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.680
I like Belgium.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.000
I've never been there, but I like it.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.720
We like having, I like the fries.

05:47.720 --> 05:52.480
We like having new, and waffles, I'm just kidding, but we like having new listeners.

05:52.480 --> 05:53.980
It's pretty cool.

05:53.980 --> 05:54.980
And new people in chat.

05:54.980 --> 05:58.760
And I think maybe part of that has to do with the podcast feed being so far behind.

05:58.760 --> 06:02.620
And God, I hate that it's become habit here at OLR, but I swear there's a good reason

06:02.620 --> 06:04.560
for it and I will get to it in just a moment.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.160
But I do want to get into how we always start off the show.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.160
How was your gaming week?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.760
DarkSoccer, how was your gaming week?

06:09.760 --> 06:15.600
My gaming week was pretty much The Sims, as I'm doing right now.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.400
Awesome.

06:17.400 --> 06:26.280
And actually, I did do some looking into Sims 3, so I'm very, very much looking forward

06:26.280 --> 06:28.160
to getting my hands on that.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.640
And you know, we do have to remember, there might be some people out there going, oh my

06:31.640 --> 06:35.960
gosh, The Sims, but The Sims is like the best selling PC game ever.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.240
So you know, we do have to remember that there is a huge audience for these games.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.320
And a lot of anticipation.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.800
I don't know about your neck of the woods, folks, but I was seeing a bunch of billboards

06:45.800 --> 06:47.580
in the Bay Area this weekend for Sims 3.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.160
They have this whole Let There Be Sims campaign going on.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.360
So this is setting up to be a big event, and it's all next week, same time as E3.

06:54.360 --> 06:58.920
I'll be honest, I actually, you know, the biggest thing that I like to do, and I quit

06:58.920 --> 07:03.160
playing it because that was all I was doing for a while, it's pretty much the thing that

07:03.160 --> 07:05.120
I like to do is make houses.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.540
I love designing shit.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.480
I love designing shit.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.840
I mean, I guess maybe that's why I'm in school for it, maybe?

07:12.840 --> 07:18.220
But the most fun for me has really been, you know, getting these bizarro little houses

07:18.220 --> 07:19.220
and putting them together.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.400
I've been greatly, greatly enjoying it.

07:21.400 --> 07:26.080
You know, I can sympathize, DarkSakura, because that's why I love Quake Live, because I love

07:26.080 --> 07:28.120
shooting people in the face.

07:28.120 --> 07:29.120
And that's what I'm trying to-

07:29.120 --> 07:30.120
I love shooting people in the face, too!

07:30.120 --> 07:33.400
That's what I'm trying to study in school, is shooting people in the face.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.400
But they don't-

07:34.400 --> 07:35.400
What a coincidence!

07:35.400 --> 07:36.400
I had to make my own major for that.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.600
That's part of, that's actually part of a designer's job, is shooting their clients

07:39.600 --> 07:41.440
in the face when they're belligerent.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.440
I'm sorry, I'm kidding.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.800
That won't get me any clients, will it?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.600
Obviously, I'm just teasing DarkSakura.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.840
That was a little parody there.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.280
I was parodying your parody.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.320
I was parodizing your parody.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.360
I consider my parody parodied.

07:56.360 --> 08:00.280
Yeah, I'm gonna get your coffee now.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
Alright, yay!

08:01.280 --> 08:03.600
Good, because I don't want you to hear about my gaming week.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.600
Loki, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

08:06.600 --> 08:09.600
I only played really two different things.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.920
First being the modified version of Grand Theft Auto IV.

08:11.920 --> 08:18.640
We're still tweaking it to get it just right, but now we have flying police cars, super

08:18.640 --> 08:24.720
ambulances, guns that shoot fire, guns that shoot explosions, guns that shoot blasts of

08:24.720 --> 08:27.520
air that launch people into the air.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.880
So it's been a lot of fun.

08:29.880 --> 08:34.440
I'm actually looking forward to one of the stories we're gonna get into later where they're

08:34.440 --> 08:38.520
actually gonna have the expansions on their own disc, because then I can actually edit

08:38.520 --> 08:43.840
everything in Lost and Damned and the new expansions, so that'll be cool.

08:43.840 --> 08:51.320
And then today I decided to play my copy of Fuel that I got a little early, and that's

08:51.320 --> 08:52.320
actually really fun.

08:52.320 --> 09:00.600
And when they tell you that it has 1,800 square kilometers in the game, it does, and it feels

09:00.600 --> 09:01.600
like it.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.720
And it actually breaks it down to 19 different zones in the game.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.960
The one you start off in, when you look at the map it doesn't look that big, but then

09:08.960 --> 09:12.800
when you actually try driving in it, it's huge.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.120
And one of the achievements is actually driving from the first outpost that you get to the

09:16.120 --> 09:18.560
next outpost you unlock.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.320
And it took me a good 30 minutes to drive that.

09:20.320 --> 09:26.560
And I'm talking the most direct route I could possibly take, not on roads, just going straight

09:26.560 --> 09:30.560
towards the next outpost, over mountains, everything.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.960
It's just insane, the size of the game.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.600
And what's even better, though, is the fact that you don't really have to do the races,

09:37.600 --> 09:42.120
because there's actually, the currency in the game is fuel, and there's these oil barrels

09:42.120 --> 09:48.680
that you'll find that you just run into them and you get more fuel to buy new cars.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.880
But it's an awesome game, and it's going to be really fun online.

09:51.880 --> 09:56.560
So if you're a fan of racing games, especially like Motorstorm, definitely going to be a

09:56.560 --> 09:57.560
game for you.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.040
Now, here's the burning question I have about this game, fuel.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.240
Because they talk about, you know, that there's all this vast amount of land, that it's like

10:03.240 --> 10:05.480
huge, you know, all this area that you can drive.

10:05.480 --> 10:10.400
But is it interesting backdrop drop, or is it desert bus thrilling?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.400
I mean...

10:11.400 --> 10:14.000
No, it's very, there's a lot of variety in the terrain.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.120
I mean, a lot of variety.

10:15.120 --> 10:18.680
I mean, you'll get up on top of a mountain, you'll look, and you can see mountains way

10:18.680 --> 10:20.560
in the distance, and you can actually drive there.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.560
I mean...

10:21.560 --> 10:23.320
So it's kind of like Oblivion, but for driving.

10:23.320 --> 10:27.240
Because that's the feel I get from Oblivion, is like, Oblivion is effing huge.

10:27.240 --> 10:31.520
You will never see everything in that game unless you are a sick, sad person.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.520
You know what I mean?

10:32.520 --> 10:37.200
This seriously, okay, I got tired from driving.

10:37.200 --> 10:43.120
Like, it took me so long to get to the next destination, I got like driver's syndrome

10:43.120 --> 10:44.120
or whatever, you know.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.120
I felt tired.

10:45.120 --> 10:48.360
In fact, that's actually when I turned the game off, because I'd been playing for a few

10:48.360 --> 10:49.360
hours.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.400
But it's actually really fun.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.660
There's a lot of variety, there's a lot of events that you can do, or you can just drive

10:55.660 --> 10:56.660
around.

10:56.660 --> 11:00.000
You can make your own events and challenge people online with them.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.920
You can, there's a bunch of different, you know, environments, day night cycles, different

11:04.920 --> 11:08.240
weather effects that you have.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.240
Lots of forests.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.360
I mean, like, I was driving through forests, and then driving across farmland, and then

11:13.360 --> 11:14.360
I got to the desert.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.360
I mean, it literally, there's a ton of stuff.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.640
And I mean, it has some stuff that, I guess it's supposed to be similar to the United

11:20.640 --> 11:21.640
States.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.880
Obviously the map's not set up like the United States, but it's got parts that like, okay,

11:25.880 --> 11:30.440
maybe this is supposed to be Seattle, maybe this is like, you know, Nevada or something

11:30.440 --> 11:32.140
like that.

11:32.140 --> 11:38.420
But it's actually pretty sweet, so, um, you know, really gonna be holding my attention

11:38.420 --> 11:40.460
for a while, at least as far as racing games go.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.600
And it's an arcade style racer, so you'd probably like it.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.680
I was gonna say, this, you know what, I was kind of feeling like, okay, I'm kind of looking

11:46.680 --> 11:48.360
a little apprehensive about this game.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.920
But now I'm hearing you describe it, I'm like, wow, I like want this game right now.

11:51.920 --> 11:52.920
It's fun, yeah.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.800
How does, what would you compare the controls to?

11:54.800 --> 11:57.680
What's the closest game you can think of that this controls to?

11:57.680 --> 12:00.680
Is it like F-Zero, or is it Forza?

12:00.680 --> 12:02.680
You know, how, what are the controls?

12:02.680 --> 12:06.660
Probably just like Motorstorm, I mean, there's no nitrous in it, but it's very simple.

12:06.660 --> 12:12.360
It's like, you know, right trigger for accelerator, left trigger for brake, and then X for hand

12:12.360 --> 12:13.360
brake.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.360
That's it.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.360
I'm, I'm very curious about this.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.360
You, you definitely piqued my interest.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.800
Um, actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrader.com says, it's made by Codemasters, and they make

12:20.800 --> 12:22.400
pretty damn awesome driving games.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.400
Yeah, like, Dirt was a really, that was Codemasters, right?

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
That was Codemasters, yeah.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.720
That was a really interesting game to look at, but I couldn't control it for crap.

12:28.720 --> 12:33.440
See, this is the other thing, it, the graphics in it aren't, like, they're good, but they're

12:33.440 --> 12:37.600
not like, you know, the level of polish that you see in, like, Dirt 2's trailers and stuff

12:37.600 --> 12:38.700
like that.

12:38.700 --> 12:42.340
But I mean, it makes sense, because they have this huge landscape that they have to pop

12:42.340 --> 12:43.340
you with everything.

12:43.340 --> 12:48.880
And there's actually stuff around, you'll see, um, you know, I've ran over a dead, uh,

12:48.880 --> 12:54.480
horse skeleton, I ran, um, there's, like, all these barns and farmland and stuff like

12:54.480 --> 12:58.440
that, and you can, all of them have, like, ramps on them, so you can jump those.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.440
Um, I don't know, there's, like, different events.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.720
They have one that's, like, chase the copter, and you basically have to just try to navigate

13:05.720 --> 13:10.280
your way to a helicopter, and, although I haven't seen it yet, there's tornadoes, so

13:10.280 --> 13:12.720
you have to race through tornadoes.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.760
That's awesome.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.520
This could be, you know, I haven't heard a lot about this game, so maybe this is, like,

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
gonna be a sleeper hit.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.520
I don't know.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.520
It's been getting OK reviews.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
I mean, it's fun.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.600
Where are people critical of the game, and do you agree?

13:23.600 --> 13:26.800
I haven't read the reviews yet, but I just saw the number of reviews, and they're, like,

13:26.800 --> 13:31.160
getting mid eights, low, mid sevens, low eights, you know.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.600
But I mean, it's just a number.

13:32.600 --> 13:36.800
It's really, I've been looking forward to this game ever since they announced it, and

13:36.800 --> 13:37.880
I think it's worth it.

13:37.880 --> 13:43.160
It's gonna be very fun, and, you know, the fact that they have online, you can do online

13:43.160 --> 13:47.120
free mode, so basically you're just driving with your friends.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.840
Well, that was kind of test drive, wasn't it?

13:48.840 --> 13:49.840
It was very similar to that.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.840
Test drive sucked.

13:50.840 --> 13:51.840
I mean...

13:51.840 --> 13:52.840
I thought it was OK.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
OK, test drive was awful.

13:53.840 --> 13:59.920
I mean, like, the landscape was very plain, and the police couldn't chase after you off

13:59.920 --> 14:00.920
the road.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.200
It was just...

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
I don't know.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.320
But, yeah, it's gonna be a good game.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.960
Comes out next week.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.960
Definitely worth picking it up.

14:11.960 --> 14:15.680
Redertainment in our chat room asks, racing tornadoes, is Helen Hunt involved in this

14:15.680 --> 14:16.680
game?

14:16.680 --> 14:17.680
I don't know.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.680
People have been looking for tornadoes.

14:18.680 --> 14:19.800
I mean, they haven't...

14:19.800 --> 14:21.240
I haven't found one yet.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.240
I've just...

14:22.240 --> 14:25.240
The only kind of weather that I've driven through, and maybe just because I'm only in

14:25.240 --> 14:30.240
the one section of the map, although, I mean, the other sections of the maps are locked,

14:30.240 --> 14:31.240
but not necessarily...

14:31.240 --> 14:35.420
I mean, you can drive through them and stuff, but none of the events appear until you've

14:35.420 --> 14:39.480
unlocked, you know, so many races and stuff, but, I mean, free mode, you can drive across

14:39.480 --> 14:43.280
the whole thing, and I would be willing to bet it'd take a few hours to get from one

14:43.280 --> 14:44.280
side of the map to the other.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
I mean, it's huge.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
Wow.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.520
It's like walking in oblivion would take about that long, right?

14:48.520 --> 14:50.680
Yeah, well, and then they do have helipads.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.880
You can fly to different things, but, you know, for that achievement that I wanted to

14:53.880 --> 14:59.640
get, it was drive from one without the use of helicopter, you know, it's like, wow, this

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
is long.

15:00.640 --> 15:01.640
All right, all right.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.640
Well, it sounds interesting.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
I'll have to check that out.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.640
When's this game released?

15:04.640 --> 15:05.640
Probably on the 3rd, I believe.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.640
Check it out.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.640
That's Fuel.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.640
Xbox 360 and PS3?

15:08.640 --> 15:09.640
Yep.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.640
All right.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
My Gaming Week.

15:11.640 --> 15:12.640
Okay.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.760
My Gaming Week's been interesting.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.760
There's really only been one...

15:15.760 --> 15:19.080
I haven't had a lot of time to play games because I've been out of town this week, but

15:19.080 --> 15:23.000
I decided to try something different this week, and, you know, if you were listening

15:23.000 --> 15:25.680
to the show last week, you heard that I've been kind of disillusioned with a lot of stuff

15:25.680 --> 15:26.920
that's been going on in Warcraft lately.

15:26.920 --> 15:31.000
I think I've just kind of hit my saturation point with the game itself, like, I just need

15:31.000 --> 15:35.080
a break at the expansion, even though they have the new dungeon, the old war and all

15:35.080 --> 15:36.880
that stuff, I'm just not feeling it.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.200
I needed a break from WoW.

15:39.200 --> 15:44.960
So I got a great idea for something I could do, actually, as an article for Orangelaundrator.com,

15:44.960 --> 15:50.100
and what I'm doing is an article about what I have missed in two and a half years in Final

15:50.100 --> 15:53.360
Fantasy XI, and I reactivated my account this week on Final Fantasy XI.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.360
Oh, my God.

15:55.360 --> 16:01.040
I had to come right back in the room to hear Rob say something that I was dreading.

16:01.040 --> 16:07.280
Now, something you should know, I have not told anybody this, not a single, no, one person

16:07.280 --> 16:12.160
I told this because of another conversation we were having, one person knew until now,

16:12.160 --> 16:13.160
now like what?

16:13.160 --> 16:15.040
However many people are listening, no.

16:15.040 --> 16:19.300
So it's kind of something I was keeping a little bit under wraps because it was something,

16:19.300 --> 16:23.360
you know, I wanted to kind of see what I've been missing and what I could pick up on.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.000
And I'll tell you what, damn, there is a lot that has changed.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.720
It was really hard for me to kind of get back into it.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.120
But I will say this, one thing I've noticed, and I'll write a full because I'm nowhere

16:33.120 --> 16:36.680
near ready enough to write something full for the website yet, and believe me, there

16:36.680 --> 16:38.720
will be a long article coming on the website later.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.480
I will notice this, one of the first things I noticed right away, they have made it way

16:41.480 --> 16:43.280
easier to solo in that game.

16:43.280 --> 16:48.480
Like there is so much more you can do in the first like 15 levels than you could before.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.640
Is that worth it for me to go back and play?

16:50.640 --> 16:56.200
I might, I am honestly gonna say, if you quit this game because grouping was too much for

16:56.200 --> 16:59.040
you, there might be more in this game for you now.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.480
That between these- Well that was the big thing is I hated being

17:01.480 --> 17:02.480
the party bitch.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.920
With the addition of the field manuals and this stuff where you can kind of get experience

17:05.920 --> 17:11.500
for WoW style questing, and the fact that now Easy Prey monsters are a lot easier to

17:11.500 --> 17:16.600
kill and give you like 60 experience, whereas before they would give you like 15, you know,

17:16.600 --> 17:19.280
there seems to be a lot more you can do soloing.

17:19.280 --> 17:25.520
Like I got from level 9 to level 12 in a couple hours of play, whereas before, like, man you'd

17:25.520 --> 17:30.000
have to go to the dunes or you'd have to be soloing, it was a lot harder before.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.880
So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.080
I don't know how long I'm gonna stick with it, I don't know.

17:37.080 --> 17:41.160
You know a big reason I stuck with WoW as long as I did is the people, and in Final

17:41.160 --> 17:45.140
Fantasy XI right now, there is no people, I know one person that's playing, and I have

17:45.140 --> 17:48.360
yet to run into them in the game, so I don't know.

17:48.360 --> 17:52.680
I don't know how it's gonna go, but I wanted to really see, because part of the reason

17:52.680 --> 17:56.840
I did this is because I have been so critical of Final Fantasy XI on the show and I've kind

17:56.840 --> 18:01.440
of joked with listeners that I do feel I owe it to give the educated opinion if I'm gonna

18:01.440 --> 18:04.680
knock on the game to see what I've missed in two and a half years, because every single

18:04.680 --> 18:09.040
person I talk to that still plays the game says, Rob, it has changed.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.760
Level syncing revolutionized the game, you need to go back.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.600
So I went back, so we'll see what happens.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.680
So I'm giving it a month, if I like it I'll stay, if I don't, I'll go back to WoW because

18:19.680 --> 18:21.520
I'll probably miss it in about a month's time.

18:21.520 --> 18:25.860
But honestly, with E3 this week and everything else, I don't expect to see the story on orangeonjurator.com

18:25.860 --> 18:30.040
for about two weeks, because this next week I'm not gonna be in, so it won't be for like

18:30.040 --> 18:31.040
two weeks.

18:31.040 --> 18:35.240
In case of irony, I'm actually gonna go to Sony online, they're gonna give me a walkthrough

18:35.240 --> 18:40.720
of all their MMOs, which is great because I don't have time to play any of them, so

18:40.720 --> 18:47.720
you know, but man, I wanna check out APB when that's there, because that's gonna be there.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.340
I hope Star Trek Online makes an appearance, we'll see.

18:50.340 --> 18:56.140
To quote GS68 in the chatroom, it says, an e-drinking game rule, every time Sky talks

18:56.140 --> 18:59.720
about MMOs, chug until he stops talking about them, and I told him not to do that because

18:59.720 --> 19:01.720
of die of liver failure.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.840
I know, it seems like all I ever talk about is MMOs, well I needed something, you know,

19:04.840 --> 19:10.400
just Warcraft just kinda, you know, I needed a break, which is sad because I had a break,

19:10.400 --> 19:13.400
not that long ago, but you know, it is what it is.

19:13.400 --> 19:18.000
If games aren't fun, I don't play them, so I decided to try to have fun somewhere else,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
so we'll see.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.120
Anyhow, more to come on that in future weeks.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.360
That was pretty much it for my gaming week.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.920
I played some Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but it's all stuff I've talked about before.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.000
I'm sure you all were gonna get a kick out of that one anyway.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.600
Oh, and the show wasn't uploaded because his drive failed.

19:31.600 --> 19:35.000
Yes, actually, which I was gonna get into on housekeeping, thank you.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.480
Sorry, I thought you were doing housekeeping.

19:36.480 --> 19:42.440
No, it had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XI keeping me from uploading the show or anything.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.920
We have a storage drive, since we moved into Studio Dark Soccer, we have a storage drive

19:45.920 --> 19:51.540
that, well wouldn't you know it, the storage drive failed this week and will not read anymore,

19:51.540 --> 19:53.780
so everything we have on that drive is lost.

19:53.780 --> 19:58.280
Now the good news is, everything is saved to this local computer in the studio anyway,

19:58.280 --> 20:02.680
so it's not like we lost the files completely, but at least I hope, I didn't check, but I

20:02.680 --> 20:04.040
don't think there would be a reason.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.720
I'm pretty sure we always would copy them over.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.480
So we should be caught up on the podcast sometime this week.

20:09.480 --> 20:13.160
It's gonna be very tough with E3 and everything going on, but I want to get at least last

20:13.160 --> 20:17.040
week's show up, like tomorrow before I leave, you know, and we'll slowly get caught up.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.880
But that's the reason why the podcast feed is behind and we are really, really sorry,

20:20.880 --> 20:23.640
but these things happen.

20:23.640 --> 20:24.640
Technical difficulties.

20:24.640 --> 20:32.560
I wasn't here last week because I was laying floor, which I just finished today.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.200
It took forever.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
But it looks nice.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.880
Rama in chat says, Sky, it's not lost, I can tell you how to retrieve it.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.080
Don't worry, we have a backup copy here on this computer, it's not gonna need anything

20:41.080 --> 20:45.800
fancy or what have you, especially if somebody's been bootlegging the show now, which I heard

20:45.800 --> 20:49.920
has been happening, just in case a future loss, we're fine.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.160
We should have everything on this computer.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.200
Stay tuned to our Twitter for more updates.

20:54.200 --> 20:59.800
And by the way, if you're not on the Twitter for OLR, please get on there, twitter.com

20:59.800 --> 21:04.080
slash OLR, because I'm telling you what, the Twitter users are going to be controlling

21:04.080 --> 21:05.800
E3 for Orange Lounge Radio.

21:05.800 --> 21:09.040
We are going to be tweeting from the show floor, what do you want us to look at?

21:09.040 --> 21:10.480
What do you want pictures of?

21:10.480 --> 21:12.160
What do you want us to ask?

21:12.160 --> 21:15.440
What games are you not hearing enough about on the main sites, you know, because you know

21:15.440 --> 21:19.760
everybody's gonna be talking about PSP Go and whatever Microsoft says, and if Nintendo

21:19.760 --> 21:22.240
throws out a new Mario game, they're gonna be talking about that.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.840
And that there's gonna be so many games that are overlooked.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.880
That's what we're focusing on E3 this year, the stuff that everyone else overlooks.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.600
We have to find the Korean porn games.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.000
We will be looking for the Korean porn games, you betcha.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I hope they're there.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.360
I hope the loss of Kensha Hall did not make us lose the porn games.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.880
I love Kensha Hall.

21:39.880 --> 21:44.440
I know, I'm very sad to see it's gone, but it looks like they have a lot of those developers

21:44.440 --> 21:45.760
in West Hall on the side.

21:45.760 --> 21:50.320
So we'll see, I'm thinking they just did some clever rearranging of things, and there are

21:50.320 --> 21:51.920
a few people that aren't there this year.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.000
You know, we don't have Atari this year, which by the way, Loki reminded me, there won't

21:55.000 --> 21:57.600
be Star Trek Online, because Atari's not there.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.600
But, you know, there's some other companies that aren't there, so we'll see what happens.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.080
They're normally in the closet anyways over there.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.200
Remember last time, you know.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.960
Oh, Atari, you're only one of the big innovators of the...

22:07.960 --> 22:08.960
Stupid douchebag.

22:08.960 --> 22:14.320
Who was that douchebag with the, like, skateboard with carpet on it, with the PSP inside the

22:14.320 --> 22:15.320
skateboard?

22:15.320 --> 22:16.320
Nah.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.320
Oh, yeah.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.320
Oh, God.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.320
I hate that guy.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.320
Yeah, I remember that guy.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.320
Anyway, I will be at the show Tuesday, Wednesday.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.320
Loki will be at the show Wednesday, Thursday.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.840
So between the two of us, we'll have the show covered all three days.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.240
We're going, at least I think I am going to a party Wednesday night.

22:28.240 --> 22:31.840
I'm hearing all these people talk about, oh, I got invited to seven parties and all that.

22:31.840 --> 22:36.520
I think we're going to a party Wednesday night for Games for Windows, and thank you very

22:36.520 --> 22:38.680
much for passing along the invite for that.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.400
We're going to check it out, see what that's all about.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.400
PC games.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.900
I know that's something Dark Soccer is into, obviously, so I think for her, we need to

22:44.900 --> 22:48.000
check out what Games for Windows is all about and see what they're going to be announcing

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
there.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Find out what doesn't suck.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Definitely.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
All right.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.720
So what does suck, we got so much news this week to get to, we're already 20 minutes into

22:55.720 --> 22:58.560
the show and then some, let's get into the gaming news this week.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.240
Loki, start us off.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.240
Yes.

23:01.240 --> 23:08.720
So the rumor is that, you know, the PlayStation Slim, or PlayStation 3's, Slimmer model, whatever

23:08.720 --> 23:12.920
they're going to call it, is supposed to be coming out August or September, according

23:12.920 --> 23:15.720
to the Ars Technica Mole.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.200
Now, why should we believe this?

23:18.200 --> 23:22.520
Well, because they were the one that talked about PSP Go, and, well, we'll be getting

23:22.520 --> 23:29.000
into that later, but I think you all know that that was true, and there's actually box

23:29.000 --> 23:36.040
shots that were leaked also of the PSP Go, which looked very similar to the PS3, so it

23:36.040 --> 23:37.040
probably will be true.

23:37.040 --> 23:42.120
I mean, you pretty much guessed that most of the stuff that's rumored and being hammered

23:42.120 --> 23:47.920
in that it's going to happen is probably going to be true, and a lot of the stuff won't come

23:47.920 --> 23:48.920
as a surprise.

23:48.920 --> 23:53.360
What's interesting, though, there's a lot of people that say the PS3 Slim is still BS,

23:53.360 --> 23:56.960
and I was listening to Bobby, who's on Right Before Us on All Games Radio, and he was talking

23:56.960 --> 24:02.960
about how they don't, his hardware expert folks that help him do Friday night gaming,

24:02.960 --> 24:07.840
don't think that it could fit, that there's so much that goes with Blu-ray that you can't

24:07.840 --> 24:12.760
slim it down that much more, unless there, now my thought is maybe there's a technology

24:12.760 --> 24:17.040
we're unaware of yet, I don't know, but, you know.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.200
I think that it's going to happen.

24:19.200 --> 24:23.880
I mean, we're going to find out about it tomorrow, or not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.640
I don't think, well, I don't think we're actually going to find out about it tomorrow, I think

24:26.640 --> 24:31.180
there's a good argument being made that they want to keep this thing under wraps, notice

24:31.180 --> 24:38.440
how this got cease and desisted, whereas nothing else that's been leaked from Sony, including

24:38.440 --> 24:42.360
things we're going to get into later and so on, that a lot of you probably heard about,

24:42.360 --> 24:46.240
have been, or have not been cease and desisted, but Sony's kind of confirmed that.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.960
The reason why, and, you know, because it's all going to be revealed Wednesday anyway,

24:49.960 --> 24:50.960
it's all about hype, right?

24:50.960 --> 24:54.240
Well, yes, but this hasn't been, this was probably going to be a big surprise or something,

24:54.240 --> 24:59.080
but the other PSP Go stuff, that's already been released by Sony.

24:59.080 --> 25:04.280
I mean, it's, you know, their online magazine or whatever that's releasing the information

25:04.280 --> 25:05.280
about it.

25:05.280 --> 25:09.320
If the PS3 comes out, if this PS3 slim comes out, or they come out Wednesday and say the

25:09.320 --> 25:14.200
PlayStation 3 is going to be getting a slim model in a few months, sales of the PlayStation

25:14.200 --> 25:18.720
3 will stop, because everybody is going, it will come to a standstill, because everybody's

25:18.720 --> 25:19.960
going to be waiting for this new system.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.080
No it won't, and you know why?

25:21.080 --> 25:25.040
It's because the same reason why there's a new skew of the PlayStation 3 every time.

25:25.040 --> 25:29.540
They don't stop sales, and if anything, what they'll do is a price drop on the current

25:29.540 --> 25:34.000
system, they'll drop it down to clear out inventory, and then you'll have the new system

25:34.000 --> 25:38.200
coming out at this, you know, normal price.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.440
They've done the same pattern every time.

25:40.440 --> 25:45.960
You know, it was $4.99, or before it was $5.99 and $4.99, and then they would drop the system

25:45.960 --> 25:51.560
that was $5.99 down to $4.99 and clear it out, and then the new system would come out

25:51.560 --> 25:52.560
at $5.99.

25:52.560 --> 25:57.200
Well, now that they've dropped it to $100 again, it's $4.99 and $3.99, same type of

25:57.200 --> 25:58.200
thing is going to happen.

25:58.200 --> 26:02.360
These are going to drop down to maybe $50, and they're going to clear them out, or they

26:02.360 --> 26:06.520
may even just keep offering it on the side and just have this one skew or whatever later

26:06.520 --> 26:08.800
on towards the holidays.

26:08.800 --> 26:13.040
But they're just going to, you know, drop the price of it a little bit until the, you

26:13.040 --> 26:16.320
know, systems clear out, and then they're going to have the new one.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.920
All right, well, we'll see.

26:18.920 --> 26:22.480
I mean, there's a lot to be seen out of the press conference, and I think this is one

26:22.480 --> 26:25.120
of the will they or won't they items.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.520
But one interesting thing, I don't know if it's going to be covered tomorrow at the whole

26:28.520 --> 26:35.800
press conference, but apparently Africa is finally getting some type of U.S. release.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
That's right.

26:36.800 --> 26:40.640
I mean, apparently Africa is finally going to be coming to the U.S., but they changed

26:40.640 --> 26:42.000
the spelling back.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.320
It's actually going to be Africa with a C now.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.040
It's not going to be with a K. Apparently it was a big part of it.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.040
Rob.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.040
How can they do that to us?

26:49.040 --> 26:50.040
It's not Africa.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.040
It's Africa.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
Oh, sorry.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.040
Africa.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.880
But apparently with less K and more C. I don't know.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.120
Was it offensive or something?

26:58.120 --> 27:00.020
I don't know why, but yeah.

27:00.020 --> 27:05.480
They are deciding to change the name back to Africa with a C. But it is finally coming

27:05.480 --> 27:08.560
out for the PlayStation 3, so if you were importing it, you don't really have to do

27:08.560 --> 27:09.560
that anymore.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.560
I want to hunt animals.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.560
Can we hunt animals?

27:11.560 --> 27:12.560
No.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.560
Dang it.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.560
Why, I am not buying as well.

27:14.560 --> 27:17.980
Yeah, there's still that Jambo Safari remake we talked about last week to look forward

27:17.980 --> 27:18.980
to much more.

27:18.980 --> 27:20.320
You missed that, by the way, Loki.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.560
The Jambo Safari announcement, I'm sure you read about it, but you know, we were very

27:24.560 --> 27:25.840
excited about that last week.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.840
That totally excites me.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.880
Now if you want a game like Africa where you can run over the animals, you need to buy

27:29.880 --> 27:30.880
Far Cry 2.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.400
That's basically Africa with running over animals.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.680
Although you have malaria, that's not fun either.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.480
Real quick before we get to the next story, Tiger Claw says, that's a damn shame.

27:39.480 --> 27:43.120
I kind of like the other title, Hakuna Matata.

27:43.120 --> 27:49.880
It is kind of a cute title, but I bet Disney would glare if that happened here in the US.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.360
That game actually came out with release.

27:51.360 --> 27:55.880
I mean, it's not like they own the rights to that phrase, but you know, come on.

27:55.880 --> 28:00.280
Whenever you hear Hakuna Matata, you can't help but think of Hakuna Matata.

28:00.280 --> 28:05.680
Well now they're going to try to trademark the word up, so you know.

28:05.680 --> 28:10.360
They've already got one of the directions, I mean, why not?

28:10.360 --> 28:13.040
Hopefully they don't trademark Orange Launch Radio or we're going to be in trouble.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.040
I don't know.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.040
We'll see.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.080
We need to hurry up and you know, actually get some sort of trade.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.080
Patent pending.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
Yeah, patent pending.

28:20.080 --> 28:24.880
Actually, did you know, if you search the internet for, well obviously there's the band

28:24.880 --> 28:31.840
act that we do take our namesake from in Japan, although that's a Japanese artist, not an

28:31.840 --> 28:34.400
American artist.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.400
There's some place, like some building or something.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.720
There's actually like a music thing called the Orange Lounge where I guess they have

28:41.720 --> 28:44.680
these musical acts come perform.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.280
I think it's in Southern California too.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.000
I think it's some type of gallery or whatever.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.800
I found out when doing a search one night, you know, randomly just like, what else is

28:50.800 --> 28:51.800
named Orange Lounge out there?

28:51.800 --> 28:52.800
How big are we on the internet?

28:52.800 --> 28:57.040
It's, well, it's interesting because you would think they would have really not liked the

28:57.040 --> 29:00.960
fact that there's an Orange Lounge radio out there because we're both music oriented in

29:00.960 --> 29:01.960
a way.

29:01.960 --> 29:02.960
But here's the catch.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.080
We've been around since 2001.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.080
They haven't.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.000
So if they did say anything, we'd be able to say, uh, we were first.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
You change your name.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
No, you.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
But I mean, you know, it would be interesting to see what happens.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Anyhow, enough of that.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.480
Let's move on with the gaming news.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.760
Well, we have some very interesting stuff.

29:20.760 --> 29:27.960
And actually it's a confirmation for something that, uh, Loki brought up is that Sony did

29:27.960 --> 29:34.100
accidentally let stuff out on the PSP go, which, you know what, honestly, I think sometimes

29:34.100 --> 29:36.680
this accidental stuff is half on purpose.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.680
Accidental my ass.

29:37.680 --> 29:43.160
They throw it out enough for it to catch on and then say, oh no, cease and desist, get

29:43.160 --> 29:44.160
this crap off of here.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.340
You know, just tease, tease, tease, tease, tease.

29:46.340 --> 29:53.760
It's enough for the fanboys to get aroused by it, but not enough for the big sites, the

29:53.760 --> 29:58.040
AP, CNN, and all these to report on it just yet.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.480
It's bait.

29:59.480 --> 30:05.440
It's exactly, it's bait because it's basically generating buzz for this now so that you want

30:05.440 --> 30:08.920
to hear, you know, what's going to happen at the press conference and you all tuned

30:08.920 --> 30:11.120
into that to find out their other announcements.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.680
It's bait is what it is.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.800
I'll tell us a little more about it.

30:13.800 --> 30:14.800
Dark saga.

30:14.800 --> 30:25.840
On Sony's core gaming show that they do, they posted the episode and then pulled it because

30:25.840 --> 30:27.600
they had talked about the PSP go on there.

30:27.600 --> 30:32.800
It has 16 gigabyte flash memory and Bluetooth support for mobile phone tethering.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.640
That's pretty cool.

30:34.640 --> 30:42.820
And also it mentioned Gran Turismo, LittleBigPlanet, Jak and Daxter, and Metal Gear Games.

30:42.820 --> 30:50.280
So there actually are some photos of it out and about, and I'm trying to pull those up

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
right now.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.280
Well, that's very interesting.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.160
I didn't, I didn't catch the part about the mobile phone tethering, but isn't that interesting

30:55.160 --> 31:00.080
because we've heard reports that the new Apple firmware is supposed to support the whole

31:00.080 --> 31:01.080
tethering thing.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.640
You're gonna have to pay more money, but I wonder, it's a very interesting time kind

31:04.640 --> 31:05.640
of thing.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.040
I think the Bluetooth is there for the mobile phone tethering.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.440
Yeah, just looking at this.

31:08.440 --> 31:12.400
I think it's just, I don't think your mic's on.

31:12.400 --> 31:16.120
Just looking at this thing though, it really looks pretty cheap to me.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.320
I mean, hey, look, you've got a little hook on there.

31:18.320 --> 31:23.160
You can wear it, I guess, or some, something, or have a strap on it or something.

31:23.160 --> 31:27.240
That's for the little, like, wrist strap thing that they have, so you don't throw it through

31:27.240 --> 31:29.920
your TV.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.440
Are they gonna make the, the, the go condom or something?

31:33.440 --> 31:34.440
Perhaps.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.440
Whatever.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.440
Go condom.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.440
That's funny.

31:37.440 --> 31:40.920
But we should be seeing an 8 gigabyte and a 16 gigabyte version.

31:40.920 --> 31:48.600
It of course has an analog nub, but not a full stick, because of course the screen slides

31:48.600 --> 31:49.600
upwards.

31:49.600 --> 31:56.240
You've got your D-pad, start select, and your four buttons.

31:56.240 --> 32:03.480
You have a Wi-Fi indicator at the top left above the screen, and you have a PS button

32:03.480 --> 32:11.440
and a Bluetooth light, and some shoulder buttons, of course, are on the top, so.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.600
But I don't know, it looks kind of cheap to me.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.200
Interesting comment from SonOfDad in chat, I like this observation.

32:17.200 --> 32:22.040
If you notice John Collar say that with some games being announced at E3, they knew it

32:22.040 --> 32:23.680
was gonna be leaked before E3.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.440
So maybe the phrasing that they used in some of the interviews, they knew this was gonna

32:27.440 --> 32:29.280
be leaked before E3 actually happened.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.280
Oh, no doubt.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.280
No doubt about it.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.720
I mean, this is Sony.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.240
And please excuse my voice tonight.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.560
I don't know if I said earlier in the show, but I've like thrown out my voice this weekend

32:38.560 --> 32:40.200
with some of the other stuff I had going on, so.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.200
Rob's changed his throat now.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.200
If I crack.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.200
He's still got a 12 year old boy.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.620
I know if I crack while reading some of your chat comments, it's not puberty, okay?

32:45.620 --> 32:47.940
It's just I've really hurt my voice this week.

32:47.940 --> 32:50.080
But here's what really happened.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.480
What?

32:51.480 --> 32:52.720
Nothing.

32:52.720 --> 32:58.080
So I get it, you were making a joke, all right.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.080
Anyhow.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.080
Haha.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.080
Loki, make yourself useful.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.080
I'm giving you some gaming news.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.080
All right.

33:03.080 --> 33:07.560
So more information from the quote unquote leaked issue of CORE.

33:07.560 --> 33:11.600
They also had some different games that were being announced in there as well, including

33:11.600 --> 33:13.840
Gran Turismo PSP.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.680
Right.

33:15.680 --> 33:20.240
Gran Turismo PSP being announced for the, or being announced.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.480
Was that supposed to have come out like years ago?

33:22.480 --> 33:25.960
Yeah, I was like, wasn't Gran Turismo for the PSP announced like in 2005?

33:25.960 --> 33:26.960
Exactly.

33:26.960 --> 33:30.000
A new Jak and Daxter game for the PSP.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.520
Oh, that's a surprise.

33:31.520 --> 33:36.040
And also a new Metal Gear Solid game for the PSP.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.040
Which is interesting.

33:37.040 --> 33:42.440
They also had other clips, including footage from LittleBigPlanet, which that looks awesome.

33:42.440 --> 33:49.240
And you know, some other stuff, possibility of Warhawk as well.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.240
I don't know.

33:50.240 --> 33:55.840
But I'm sure we're going to get a lot of PSP buzz coming from the press conference N8E3.

33:55.840 --> 33:59.080
To shut up those people that says that they really haven't released anything on the PSP

33:59.080 --> 34:02.040
in the past year, which would be somewhat true.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.140
You know what I mean?

34:03.140 --> 34:07.100
Like this is to derive, I mean, especially come out on Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.100
That's huge.

34:08.100 --> 34:10.800
And it's not, you know, the portable ops.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.800
It's not acid.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.800
It's not port.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.800
It's, it's fricking solid.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.960
So, you know, I, and I, solid.

34:16.960 --> 34:17.960
It's a solid game.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.240
Here's now one thing that didn't make our show real tonight is about the Kojima countdowns

34:21.240 --> 34:23.480
that have been going on because, you know, stories about countdowns are getting a little

34:23.480 --> 34:25.400
old here on horizontal radio.

34:25.400 --> 34:29.000
But I mean, if this is what it is building up towards, I think it's building up to

34:29.000 --> 34:30.240
multiple things, actually.

34:30.240 --> 34:34.360
I think that the countdown's building up to three different announcements.

34:34.360 --> 34:39.240
One being a Raiden Metal Gear Solid game, which is probably going to be for the PS3.

34:39.240 --> 34:43.680
The other being this probably Metal Gear Solid game based off of kind of the timeline of

34:43.680 --> 34:46.940
Metal Gear Solid 3, you know, with Big Boss.

34:46.940 --> 34:52.920
And also, I think, that game Mask, which looks like a survivor horror game that he was supposed

34:52.920 --> 34:55.720
to be working on a survivor horror game, so.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.560
Another survival horror from Konami?

34:57.560 --> 35:00.160
I mean, that would be their third.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.160
That's big.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.960
Behind Silent Hill, Saw, and now this?

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
Really?

35:03.960 --> 35:04.960
Yeah.

35:04.960 --> 35:05.960
Interesting.

35:05.960 --> 35:10.280
Well, it was supposed to be a zombie, like, you know, Left 4 Dead type of game, but still

35:10.280 --> 35:11.280
survivor horror.

35:11.280 --> 35:14.400
Oh, so, like, maybe more action-y than what we're used to.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.880
I don't know, but it's a creepy picture that they have, so.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.680
Uh, DarkTetsuya seems to agree with you.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.440
It says in chat, you know, Loki's probably right.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.720
You might want to be careful when you say things like that.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.440
Don't let it get to his head.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.080
Alright, I'm curious, chat room, what do you guys think?

35:31.080 --> 35:32.720
Do you think Loki's right?

35:32.720 --> 35:36.160
Do you think it means three different games could possibly be on their way?

35:36.160 --> 35:42.760
Or this could be the E3 of nothing but Metal Gear, which would, you know, kind of make

35:42.760 --> 35:48.760
sense a little bit, because we haven't heard a lot coming out of Konami's camp.

35:48.760 --> 35:49.760
They've got some good stuff.

35:49.760 --> 35:53.240
We'll have more later on, and I'm sure they're going to be showcasing the Saw game and some

35:53.240 --> 35:54.240
of their music games.

35:54.240 --> 35:55.240
Boo!

35:55.240 --> 35:56.240
What else?

35:56.240 --> 36:00.280
They've also got that, uh, there wasn't a lot that came out of their Gamers' Day.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.440
There's that one that looked like Castlevania, but wasn't Castlevania, which I don't remember

36:03.440 --> 36:08.120
the hell that game was called, but we were supposed to be talking about last week, and

36:08.120 --> 36:16.480
then there was also, you know, their music games, Saw, Silent Hill, the new one that's

36:16.480 --> 36:18.280
Shattered Memories or whatever that was.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.960
Oh yeah, the Wii one.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.240
Which actually looks really cool.

36:22.240 --> 36:27.440
It's apparently different each time you play it, depending on how you answer their personality

36:27.440 --> 36:28.440
profile thing.

36:28.440 --> 36:31.520
It's like the eHarmony of Survivor Horror.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.520
Hooray!

36:32.520 --> 36:35.000
You better hurry up and trademark that!

36:35.000 --> 36:38.680
I hope it doesn't reject me for being a fag, just like eHarmony would.

36:38.680 --> 36:43.640
Don't just put a gay bar where the bar normally goes.

36:43.640 --> 36:50.200
No, and then they have some other game, it's like Tornadoes.

36:50.200 --> 36:54.320
It'll make all the zombies just want to dance.

36:54.320 --> 36:57.320
That's horrible.

36:57.320 --> 37:03.160
Prop 8 will attack you instead.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.240
Prop 8 will kick me in the face.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.240
That's what I'll get.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.760
There's way too much gay going on in the show right now.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.800
Anyway, so they've got stuff that haven't been announced yet.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.920
Tornadoes Outbreak was the other game, which is coming out in September.

37:17.920 --> 37:23.880
I don't know what the hell it is, but it's a game from Konami, and it has tornadoes in

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
it.

37:24.880 --> 37:25.880
It's like tornadoes!

37:25.880 --> 37:29.680
An outbreak of them.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.960
Alright well guess what, Sony doesn't just make Playstations and PSPs.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.800
Believe it or not, they're actually a pretty big company.

37:34.800 --> 37:39.360
I'm not sure if you've heard of Sony before, but they do a lot outside of just the games.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.640
One of the things they develop is mobile phones.

37:41.640 --> 37:42.640
Sony what?

37:42.640 --> 37:45.120
That's right, Sony develops a phone called the iKnow.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.120
I think I'm saying that right.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.840
A-I-N-O, the iKnow mobile phone.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.760
Now this is like a new phone that they're doing.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.820
It's not something that's out yet, and it's not to be confused with that PSP phone that's

37:55.820 --> 38:00.320
been rumored about before, but apparently what this phone will do, you'll actually be

38:00.320 --> 38:04.360
able to use remote play to access your PlayStation 3.

38:04.360 --> 38:08.680
And here's the thing, the device has 3G on it, so here's the deal.

38:08.680 --> 38:14.480
When you get on this, you can use the 3G to like stream movies, images, music from your

38:14.480 --> 38:17.200
PlayStation 3 hard drive.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
Isn't that kind of neat?

38:18.200 --> 38:21.960
Yeah, so if you have porn saved on your drive, you could have that anywhere streaming over

38:21.960 --> 38:22.960
3G.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.880
What a waste of our bandwidth.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.880
Porn anywhere?

38:25.880 --> 38:27.200
Wow, that sounds like the internet.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.960
Oh wait, it is the internet.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.680
Well here's the other deal, in Europe you can get Play TV.

38:34.680 --> 38:40.240
You'll be able to view, rewind, pause, whatever live television, and you can also record it

38:40.240 --> 38:42.920
while you're on the go, the way the mobile phone is.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.280
That's technology we've never seen before.

38:45.280 --> 38:49.600
So if you forget like, oh crap, I was supposed to record Grey's Anatomy or whatever, you

38:49.600 --> 38:51.680
can set it from your phone I guess.

38:51.680 --> 38:58.480
Keep in mind though, for the most part, cell phones in Japan have been just decades ahead

38:58.480 --> 39:03.880
of what we've had here for the longest time until we started trickling out with Trios

39:03.880 --> 39:08.200
and Blackberries and finally the iPhone.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.080
Now we have all these apps for iPhones that will do all this crap for us.

39:11.080 --> 39:16.840
But still, I mean, this is probably really nothing major.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.320
This is expected probably.

39:18.320 --> 39:22.800
Yeah, I don't think the Sony I know has a shaking baby application.

39:22.800 --> 39:23.800
That's something that's missing.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.120
The iPhone doesn't have it anymore.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.120
Not anymore.

39:26.120 --> 39:28.520
They don't have the cocaine application anymore either.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.520
There was a cocaine application?

39:29.520 --> 39:32.320
You could sort the thing and then...

39:32.320 --> 39:33.320
It's a hell of a drug.

39:33.320 --> 39:36.760
We actually talked about it in my typography class.

39:36.760 --> 39:37.760
Wow.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.840
How is that relevant to typography?

39:39.840 --> 39:42.640
Do you make letters out of the coke?

39:42.640 --> 39:44.480
I know a lot of...

39:44.480 --> 39:45.960
Were some of the best fonts designed?

39:45.960 --> 39:46.960
Never mind.

39:46.960 --> 39:52.960
A lot of some of the best fonts were designed by a lot of people who were on lots of stuff.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
Alright.

39:53.960 --> 39:54.960
Let's see.

39:54.960 --> 40:00.760
Rama says, so grab your dick and double click for porn, porn, porn.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.720
Game Guru says, why would I TiVo Grey's Anatomy?

40:02.720 --> 40:03.720
I don't know.

40:03.720 --> 40:04.720
Obviously someone is.

40:04.720 --> 40:05.720
The show's still on.

40:05.720 --> 40:06.720
Exactly.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.720
You have to watch it live.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.560
Misty says, no, the internet is for OLR, which is the gateway to porn.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.560
Get it right, Game Guru.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.040
Oh, sorry.

40:15.040 --> 40:18.120
Dark Shy says, 3G coverage isn't exactly everywhere, is it?

40:18.120 --> 40:20.480
I saw a map of 3G coverage for the newest iPhone.

40:20.480 --> 40:25.320
I don't think it's everywhere, but for the big city people, I don't know where you live,

40:25.320 --> 40:30.400
but I can tell you living here in Sacramento and the places I go the most are San Francisco,

40:30.400 --> 40:32.280
LA, the places I drive.

40:32.280 --> 40:37.680
I don't ever lose 3G unless I'm in the basement of a building or behind solid wood.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.960
Walls where the signal can't reach and I'll go on edge.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.280
Like I get 3G everywhere.

40:41.280 --> 40:47.080
Well, I, and to be perfectly honest, you don't even need 3G really to get good signal in

40:47.080 --> 40:48.080
a major city.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.080
Yeah.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.340
So I've never wanted it.

40:51.340 --> 40:54.780
I mean the, I know I've heard a lot of complaints about AT&T and their coverage, but it's been

40:54.780 --> 40:55.780
fine for me.

40:55.780 --> 40:56.960
Very, very rare.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.800
Do I not have 3G?

40:58.800 --> 40:59.800
So I don't know.

40:59.800 --> 41:00.800
Maybe I'm just lucky.

41:00.800 --> 41:01.800
Now we have 4G.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.300
Yeah, I know.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.300
Fricking Apple.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.300
Yay.

41:05.300 --> 41:08.680
Do you hear this rumor about the, the dormant video thing that's been in everybody's phone

41:08.680 --> 41:11.040
the whole time that they're finally going to turn on with iPhone 3.0?

41:11.040 --> 41:12.040
Boy.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.040
Oh boy.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.280
You mean the thing that there's been a homebrew apps that have already been doing it?

41:16.280 --> 41:17.280
Yeah.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.280
That.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.900
So, I mean just a huge selling point they could have with the iPhone this whole time

41:20.900 --> 41:23.280
that they just, just, just because they can do that.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.160
But then again, Nintendo does the same shit.

41:25.160 --> 41:32.040
So there's also, um, uh, apps for, um, video play for not video, but for a sound recording.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.040
Yeah.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.760
That, that, you know, I've, I've had mine forever.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.320
I haven't used it, but I have it.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.360
Alright, well let's move on with some more, uh, gaming news, Dark Sakura.

41:40.360 --> 41:44.920
Well, something that I have been particularly looking forward to, and I'm glad finally has

41:44.920 --> 41:48.360
somewhat of a date, is, um, Star Trek Online.

41:48.360 --> 41:51.400
Because I want my own ship, dammit.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.480
Um, and according to- And I would like to throw tribbles at Dark

41:54.480 --> 41:55.480
Sakura.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.040
As long as you don't feed them.

41:58.040 --> 42:01.080
Remember if you feed them, then they breed.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.440
I have, by the way, had the most tribble-tastic week, because I think I've watched trials

42:04.440 --> 42:07.440
and tribulations, like, four times this last week.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.440
Nerd.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.800
And trouble with tribbles once.

42:10.800 --> 42:14.920
And then we tried to watch the animated episode, and then the people watching it with me complained

42:14.920 --> 42:16.160
about the bad animation quality.

42:16.160 --> 42:19.120
I swear I didn't mean to derail your story.

42:19.120 --> 42:22.400
Um, anyway.

42:22.400 --> 42:27.160
According to one of, um, Atari's financial documents, it says that they expect Star Trek

42:27.160 --> 42:32.360
Online to be out no later than March 31st, 2010.

42:32.360 --> 42:38.240
And it will be, um, both console and PC, according to the document.

42:38.240 --> 42:46.160
Um, nothing official from Cryptic yet, um, but I'm sure that we should see something

42:46.160 --> 42:47.160
soon.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.160
All right.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.160
Hopefully.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.800
I want to play!

42:50.800 --> 42:52.080
I know.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.600
Talk about the game that'll make me leave any MMO I'm playing.

42:54.600 --> 42:59.520
Wherever, wherever my fickle ass is at the moment, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI,

42:59.520 --> 43:03.920
Hal-Ragnarok, I don't know, maybe I'll get into EVE before this is all over.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.080
I'm going to Star Trek Online the minute this comes out.

43:06.080 --> 43:07.560
I need to make the O.L.O.R.I.E.N.s.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.560
Yes.

43:08.560 --> 43:13.400
I will be putting official data out for what these specs are to make an O.L.O.R.I.E.N.

43:13.400 --> 43:17.760
And I want nothing but, I want to captain my own ship of nothing but red-shirt people.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.520
You can't, because you have to, you have to have command people.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.520
Damn it!

43:21.520 --> 43:22.960
You have to have doctors.

43:22.960 --> 43:23.960
All right.

43:23.960 --> 43:25.440
Every MMO talk is bad now.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.440
Just wait until this game comes out.

43:27.440 --> 43:29.160
Wait to see how nerdy we all get.

43:29.160 --> 43:34.160
Again, and I say this every time, and I'm going to say it every time, every week, every

43:34.160 --> 43:37.240
time this game gets brought up, I'm going to say this.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.100
This game better not suck.

43:40.100 --> 43:43.160
Star Trek has so much momentum going for it right now.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.160
Please.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.120
There will be riots in the streets.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.120
It will be me.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.120
It'll just be Rob.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.120
It will be me.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.120
He'll be out there going, riot!

43:51.120 --> 43:55.720
I made a dark sakura, I will like throw a Slurpee against a window of a 7-11.

43:55.720 --> 43:58.200
That'll be my riot, okay?

43:58.200 --> 44:02.320
I will be pissed if this game sucks, and we'll put it on YouTube or something.

44:02.320 --> 44:06.120
You know, as the classic line from the movie goes, better to be pissed off than pissed

44:06.120 --> 44:07.120
on.

44:07.120 --> 44:11.440
Rama says, Sky will request a pink starship with sparkles.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.440
No.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440
No.

44:13.440 --> 44:16.520
You, wait, you're freaking like stereotyping or something?

44:16.520 --> 44:18.520
No, I do not want a pink starship with sparkles.

44:18.520 --> 44:22.080
I want a purple starship with sparkles, ass.

44:22.080 --> 44:24.520
And Stickaxe asks, what if the game sucks, Rob?

44:24.520 --> 44:26.520
Well, you heard me, riot.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.440
Then we take to the streets.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.560
Then we protest in front of Atari.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.040
It'll be a- We get all the people at Cryptic and we-

44:35.040 --> 44:36.740
It'll be a dual protest.

44:36.740 --> 44:40.900
One side of the sign will say, overturn Prop 8, and the other side will say, remake Star

44:40.900 --> 44:43.560
Trek because this version sucks.

44:43.560 --> 44:48.120
And then we subject the people at Cryptic that are in charge of that to-

44:48.120 --> 44:51.760
Um, investigation by special means.

44:51.760 --> 44:52.760
Alright.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.200
By, um, probing.

44:55.200 --> 44:56.560
That's right.

44:56.560 --> 44:57.560
There you go.

44:57.560 --> 44:58.560
There's the answer.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.560
If this game sucks, anal probes.

45:00.560 --> 45:01.560
Exactly.

45:01.560 --> 45:02.560
Alright.

45:02.560 --> 45:07.640
And I'll tell you what, just for that, I'm putting a model of the Enterprise in my home.

45:07.640 --> 45:13.000
Let's probe around the world right now and look at the upcoming release dates for upcoming

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
games.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Yes.

45:15.000 --> 45:20.360
We've got a few things coming up this week, um, including Fuel, which is gonna be awesome.

45:20.360 --> 45:25.880
That's on, uh, PS3 and Xbox 360, I think also the PC, but I don't see that.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.160
Hey, last thing, I'm sorry, every time you say that, the Metallica song pops into my

45:29.160 --> 45:30.160
head?

45:30.160 --> 45:31.160
Yes.

45:31.160 --> 45:33.640
Give me fuel, give me fire, give me that, what's hard to say?

45:33.640 --> 45:35.800
That's the only thing that's disappointing about that game.

45:35.800 --> 45:40.240
The music kinda sucks, cause it's not really any licensed music except for the theme song,

45:40.240 --> 45:44.720
which is by Uncle, which is pretty cool, and actually one of my previous cage match picks

45:44.720 --> 45:50.680
um, but yeah, all the rest of the music in the game is just kind of like, eh.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.280
But they do support custom soundtracks, so that's always good.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.840
I like how you said that, it's kinda eh.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.960
Um, okay, but other things coming out.

45:57.960 --> 46:01.640
Age of Pirates 2, City of Abandoned, on PC.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.200
Arrrrr, it's abandoned.

46:04.200 --> 46:09.480
Uh, Chicken, er, Crazy Chicken Atlantis Quest on DS.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.760
Fuck these games, weren't there like three of them last week?

46:12.760 --> 46:15.480
Crazy Chicken Star Carts on DS.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.240
These are probably the same games from last week, they just never came out.

46:19.240 --> 46:20.240
Um.

46:20.240 --> 46:21.240
Gee, I wonder why.

46:21.240 --> 46:24.000
Crazy Chicken Pharaoh's Treasure on DS.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.040
Yes, Mumbo Jumbo doesn't know anything about hitting dates as far as releases go.

46:29.040 --> 46:35.120
Um, Red Faction Guerrilla coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3, that game looks awesome.

46:35.120 --> 46:39.000
The main feature, I guess, was explosions, and you know, can't go wrong there.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
I like explosions.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
And it's on Mars.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.240
Crazy Chicken is actually, if any of these Crazy Chicken games are actually good games,

46:45.240 --> 46:48.120
I will eat, like a cup of mayonnaise.

46:48.120 --> 46:52.160
And anyone who knows me, knows that that is like my own personal hell right there.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.880
If these games are actually any good, I will down an entire cup of mayonnaise, live on

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
air.

46:56.880 --> 47:00.120
No, you have to understand, this is a character that's popular, apparently popular, in, um,

47:00.120 --> 47:01.120
the UK.

47:01.120 --> 47:04.840
And so they, they get the licensing rights really cheap, and they bring them over here.

47:04.840 --> 47:08.600
It's just like Moomin, which, you know, this company Graffiti is bringing over.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.600
I don't even know what the hell that is.

47:09.600 --> 47:13.640
It's even better that, you know, I, no disrespect to whatever they like over there in the UK,

47:13.640 --> 47:16.880
but then you're basically just telling me, oh, on top of already thinking these games

47:16.880 --> 47:20.040
are gonna suck, you're telling me they're licensed games, and how, you know, off of

47:20.040 --> 47:23.600
TV and movie properties, how often are those games any good?

47:23.600 --> 47:25.600
They're not.

47:25.600 --> 47:31.120
Um, Knights of the Nightmare on DS, coming from Atlus.

47:31.120 --> 47:34.840
And then, of course, you know, one of the bigger titles of the week, Sims 3, coming

47:34.840 --> 47:39.800
out on PC, also available in a collector's edition, where you get a bunch of useless

47:39.800 --> 47:40.800
crap.

47:40.800 --> 47:46.400
Um, and then the game with the longest title of the week, and I don't know why, but Johnny

47:46.400 --> 47:49.720
Bravo and the hunk-a-mega-mighty ultra-extreme Datorama.

47:49.720 --> 47:54.200
Yes, the title may be long, but the game still sucks.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.560
Wow.

47:55.560 --> 47:59.760
And, um, then, of course, we've got some other fun stuff.

47:59.760 --> 48:06.280
More party games from Majesco, go play lumberjacks, lumberjack-themed games, and go play Circus

48:06.280 --> 48:11.320
Star, where you can play as a, you know, circus performer.

48:11.320 --> 48:13.600
Is it a lumberjack and it's okay?

48:13.600 --> 48:14.600
Maybe.

48:14.600 --> 48:20.680
And then Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad, coming to the DS from Destineer.

48:20.680 --> 48:26.760
And finally, a week from today, the legendary Starfy, a game that apparently is a franchise

48:26.760 --> 48:28.000
in Japan.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.360
I don't know anything about it and it looks stupid, but, you know, that's just my dumb

48:32.360 --> 48:35.160
American opinion.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.160
Questions from chat.

48:36.160 --> 48:37.160
Marissa is in chat.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.160
Hi, Marissa.

48:38.160 --> 48:41.740
Marissa Gungusto asks, no Rob, not Mayo, don't do it.

48:41.740 --> 48:45.540
You know what, I'm that confident that I'm right, so I'm not even worried about it.

48:45.540 --> 48:49.320
It's just like Loki doing the bet on Eye of Judgment, the legendary bet that people still

48:49.320 --> 48:51.480
haven't shut up about two years later.

48:51.480 --> 48:55.280
He was that confident in it, and you know what, he was right.

48:55.280 --> 48:58.600
Stickaxe asks, how would we determine whether they're any good, Rob?

48:58.600 --> 49:01.160
Would it be that the games have a Metacritic score above a certain amount?

49:01.160 --> 49:03.920
I suppose, but honestly, you've been listening to this show long enough.

49:03.920 --> 49:04.920
You can trust me.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.960
If the games are good, I will tell you, and we will do it.

49:07.960 --> 49:12.440
And if you don't believe me, you think I'm lying, we can get like a, we can agree upon

49:12.440 --> 49:14.880
a non-discriminatory panel or something.

49:14.880 --> 49:15.880
I don't know.

49:15.880 --> 49:18.280
But I'm that confident these games are no good.

49:18.280 --> 49:19.400
Come on.

49:19.400 --> 49:21.760
Games like this are a dime a dozen.

49:21.760 --> 49:24.280
Do you really think there's a chance in hell I'm eating the mayonnaise?

49:24.280 --> 49:27.480
Hell no, otherwise I wouldn't have said it.

49:27.480 --> 49:29.040
Are you looking it up on Metacritic right now?

49:29.040 --> 49:36.080
Okay, this has got to go then on the official, you know, the official stuff, you know, ongoing

49:36.080 --> 49:38.280
bets on the show.

49:38.280 --> 49:41.360
You know, I think this game is so awesome, it's not even on there.

49:41.360 --> 49:44.480
Oh wait, here we go, here's the last one that came out on DS.

49:44.480 --> 49:49.720
Chicken Hunter, which is also the same franchise, they just changed the name, got a Metacritic

49:49.720 --> 49:52.640
rating of three, or thirty-nine.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.360
It's quality right there.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.360
There you go, exactly.

49:55.360 --> 49:56.360
I have nothing to worry about.

49:56.360 --> 49:58.760
You could probably go off Metacritic and I'd be just fine.

49:58.760 --> 50:02.960
Hey, let's talk about something interesting, and that is the Japanese release dates, although

50:02.960 --> 50:07.000
I do like Marissa's idea of making it bacon-aise, to make it a little easier on me.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.560
Dude, bacon-aise is great.

50:08.560 --> 50:13.240
So if I do, I do want to put that clause in the contract, just in case.

50:13.240 --> 50:17.160
The cup of mayonnaise do be bacon-aise, and I think everybody would agree, just for my

50:17.160 --> 50:21.960
own sanity and well-being, that would be the way to do it, thank you.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.800
I will end up in the hospital again with pancreatitis if I lose this bet.

50:24.800 --> 50:25.800
Just wait.

50:25.800 --> 50:26.800
Uh, anyway.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.960
That's why we'll get you some fat-free mayonnaise.

50:28.960 --> 50:31.440
Yeah, fat-free bacon-aise, good luck.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.200
They're gonna have to like, invent it.

50:33.200 --> 50:40.320
Alright, on the Xbox 360, I'm gonna have to fucking eat Miracle Whip.

50:40.320 --> 50:44.040
Eww, gross.

50:44.040 --> 50:49.080
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, nothing.

50:49.080 --> 50:52.240
It is completely empty until June 25th.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.320
There is like, nothing on the calendar right now for the Xbox 360.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.560
It's pretty boring right now over in Japan.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.080
Just not a busy time of year for them, and PlayStation 3 really doesn't look much different,

51:01.080 --> 51:02.080
I have to be honest.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.880
It's a very slow week over there.

51:03.880 --> 51:09.320
Um, moving on, however, to the Nintendo Wii, at least you get Ark Rise Fantasia comes out

51:09.320 --> 51:10.920
in Japan from Marvelous.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.200
That comes out on the Wii this week.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.000
That's really the only release to look forward to there.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.200
And taking a look at the PlayStation 2, Evangelion Joe comes out there.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.200
What?

51:20.200 --> 51:21.200
More Eva games?

51:21.200 --> 51:22.200
Of course, of course.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.320
There's just no other, uh, no other way to do it over there.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.480
And on the Nintendo DS, you have a few more options.

51:27.480 --> 51:34.040
You have Kotowari Sahai Simulation Ochanomapro Yaku D.S. is the name of that game.

51:34.040 --> 51:35.720
I'm not sure what exactly you're simulating.

51:35.720 --> 51:38.600
Oh, it looks like baseball, looks like a baseball coach game.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.660
This is, yeah.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.660
So there you go.

51:41.660 --> 51:42.660
That's baseball.

51:42.660 --> 51:46.040
Very quick on the PSP to see if there's anything of interest there, although I highly doubt

51:46.040 --> 51:47.040
it.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.200
Oh, you get a port of that same Evangelion game on the PSP.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.200
And that's really it.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.200
Kids like Eva.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.200
That's right.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.200
That's really it for Japanese releases.

51:53.200 --> 51:55.000
It's kind of a slow, uh, week for them.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.040
Well, how about we go overseas, um, in another direction?

51:59.040 --> 52:03.200
Here's, um, stuff that, uh, is coming out in, um, UK.

52:03.200 --> 52:09.160
We have, on the 5th, actually, a bunch of releases, um, at least a handful, anyway.

52:09.160 --> 52:17.080
We play Control Donkey Kong Jungle Beat on Wii, Red Faction Gorilla on Xbox 360 and PS3,

52:17.080 --> 52:24.740
Sacred 2 Fallen Angel on Xbox 360 and PS3, Star Ocean The Last Hope on Xbox 360, Walk

52:24.740 --> 52:27.760
With Me Do You Know Your Walking Routine on DS.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.840
No, I forgot how to walk.

52:30.840 --> 52:31.840
It's your walking routine.

52:31.840 --> 52:32.840
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

52:32.840 --> 52:33.840
Routine.

52:33.840 --> 52:37.240
So do I get to make a walking, like, dance routine or something?

52:37.240 --> 52:39.680
It's scheduling your walks, I guess.

52:39.680 --> 52:40.680
I guess.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.960
And then Sims 3, of course, which, yay!

52:43.960 --> 52:44.960
Happy.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.000
That's it.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.240
I don't remember you being so Sims fangirly.

52:48.240 --> 52:52.360
It's like it came out of the woodworks, or we awakened a sleeping beast within or something.

52:52.360 --> 52:56.360
I'm not sure where the- Well, it basically took at least, you know,

52:56.360 --> 53:00.920
four people I know starting to play and playing again, but I was like, uh, me as well.

53:00.920 --> 53:03.360
And then I was like, I really just like building houses.

53:03.360 --> 53:04.360
That's really it.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.640
I don't care about playing the game.

53:06.640 --> 53:12.160
I don't care about how many babies my Sims have, or, you know, who gets bitten by a vampire

53:12.160 --> 53:13.400
and who kills zombies.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.560
I care about building the houses.

53:15.560 --> 53:19.200
You sound kind of similar to Loki in how he, a lot of these games he plays, he doesn't

53:19.200 --> 53:20.200
really care about the game.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.520
He just cares about how he can hack it to his liking.

53:22.520 --> 53:25.720
I'm, like, look at my house.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.600
I am building a freaking gorgeous house.

53:27.600 --> 53:28.600
It's very red, so far.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.160
Well, that's just a wall.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.680
Well, the walls are red.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.680
Let's see.

53:32.680 --> 53:33.680
All right.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
You've built this live on air.

53:34.680 --> 53:35.680
You started from scratch at the beginning of the night, right?

53:35.680 --> 53:37.680
I started on, I actually started it last night.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.680
Oh, I thought you did the whole thing on air tonight.

53:39.680 --> 53:40.680
Here's my entire house.

53:40.680 --> 53:41.680
There's, see, there's my potty.

53:41.680 --> 53:42.680
Oh.

53:42.680 --> 53:43.680
And there's the upstairs.

53:43.680 --> 53:44.680
All right.

53:44.680 --> 53:45.680
Anyhow.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.680
This is horrible radio.

53:46.680 --> 53:47.680
They can't see it.

53:47.680 --> 53:48.680
I'll put pictures up eventually.

53:48.680 --> 53:49.680
All right.

53:49.680 --> 53:50.680
Uh, let's move on with some more gaming news.

53:50.680 --> 53:53.080
We will get into the classic game of the week and our break tonight pretty soon.

53:53.080 --> 53:56.440
We still have about 10 more stories to go over, so, uh, Loki, we've got to get to it.

53:56.440 --> 53:57.440
Sorry.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.000
I'm looking at a picture.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
That's funny.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.820
Um, DJ Hero, a game that we've been talking about for quite a while now, lots of stuff

54:04.820 --> 54:10.420
coming out this week, especially, um, game trailers ran an exclusive, um, E3 trailer

54:10.420 --> 54:16.280
that they put out showing some of the gameplay, um, which is not surprising, you know, it

54:16.280 --> 54:19.980
looks very much how they described it in the magazine, but we've got some more details

54:19.980 --> 54:20.980
now.

54:20.980 --> 54:25.720
They're going to have a few different versus modes, including DJ versus DJ, uh, DJ plus

54:25.720 --> 54:30.980
DJ, you know, like a co-op or DJ plus guitar, um, you know, for the 10 tracks that they

54:30.980 --> 54:36.640
have, um, you know, guitar support for, and, um, of course, you know, the game's going

54:36.640 --> 54:39.840
to be coming out on all platforms, rumored to be $120.

54:39.840 --> 54:47.520
Yeah, that's kind of expensive, and, um, also they're going to be having a limited edition,

54:47.520 --> 54:52.840
um, pack coming out that's going to be, uh, tying in with Jay-Z and Eminem.

54:52.840 --> 54:59.120
Apparently this is going to come with an advanced version of the controller, a DJ stand, a metal

54:59.120 --> 55:06.960
traveling case, and also, um, the greatest hit CDs from both rappers, and sadly enough

55:06.960 --> 55:08.820
I want to get that.

55:08.820 --> 55:14.240
Not because I'm fans of them, but because I like the idea of, you know, a DJ stand and

55:14.240 --> 55:17.500
a metal traveling case, so it would be all sorts of nerdy cool.

55:17.500 --> 55:20.160
This is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3.

55:20.160 --> 55:25.480
I want to see how they're pulling this off, because I love the concept, everything I'm

55:25.480 --> 55:28.000
seeing, you know, I was a little nervous when I first heard they were making this game,

55:28.000 --> 55:32.200
but everything I'm hearing, I love the idea of the songs all being mashups, everything

55:32.200 --> 55:34.480
sounds good, but it's all in the execution.

55:34.480 --> 55:37.480
This is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.940
Yep, same here.

55:39.940 --> 55:44.360
Did you see the video though this week where they did, uh, it was, um, Rick James, Give

55:44.360 --> 55:48.840
It To Me Baby, and then also, um, Hollaback Girl mixed together?

55:48.840 --> 55:50.240
No, I hadn't seen that.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.360
Oh, you gotta see that.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.120
Oh my god, they have video of gameplay now?

55:53.120 --> 55:54.120
Yeah.

55:54.120 --> 55:55.120
No, I totally missed that.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.120
Yeah.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.120
Oh my gosh, I gotta see that.

55:57.120 --> 56:01.800
So, um, they have an interview, uh, video that shows some gameplay, and then they also

56:01.800 --> 56:06.280
have the actual official trailer that has that song in there, but it's interesting.

56:06.280 --> 56:09.480
Well, our chat room is lighting up right now with comparisons, of course, whenever it seems

56:09.480 --> 56:13.320
like the DJ games get brought up, 2DX gets brought up, um, interesting enough, the next

56:13.320 --> 56:17.780
story I have has to do with Bamani and, uh, what could possibly be next in the US.

56:17.780 --> 56:21.560
It's about another music series, not Beatmania, but Poppin' Music.

56:21.560 --> 56:26.840
Now, you might remember, we all declared Poppin' Music dead in the US, uh, when Beat and Groovy

56:26.840 --> 56:27.840
crashed and burned.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.200
Remember that one on Xbox Live Marketplace?

56:29.200 --> 56:30.200
Oh my god.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.760
Damn it, Rob, I've been trying to forget about that.

56:31.760 --> 56:32.760
It was terrible.

56:32.760 --> 56:36.080
It was basically an American translation of Poppin' Music, but to call it that would be

56:36.080 --> 56:39.160
like, I don't even know how to begin to describe it.

56:39.160 --> 56:42.240
It was, it was a terrible, terrible, uh, port of Poppin' Music.

56:42.240 --> 56:44.760
It should have been cancelled by Konami before it ever came out.

56:44.760 --> 56:47.560
Uh, but what's interesting though, we might have been wrong.

56:47.560 --> 56:50.160
Poppin' Music may not be dead in the US.

56:50.160 --> 56:55.600
Apparently, there has been a trademark filed that indicates that Poppin' Music is coming

56:55.600 --> 56:58.760
to North America, and of course, if you've never played Poppin' Music before, it's like

56:58.760 --> 57:02.680
these nine giant, like, imagine the Poppa-matic bubbles from Trouble.

57:02.680 --> 57:05.440
Imagine there's nine of them all laid out in kind of a keyboard-y format.

57:05.440 --> 57:08.840
Uh, that's what the machine looks like, and it plays very similar to these beat-matching

57:08.840 --> 57:09.840
games.

57:09.840 --> 57:13.320
Um, but now this trademark was filed, and everybody thought, okay, well, maybe they

57:13.320 --> 57:14.720
are gonna bring it to the US.

57:14.720 --> 57:20.000
Well, apparently, a little more was released when Konami actually dropped the Poppin' Music

57:20.000 --> 57:21.120
Wii page.

57:21.120 --> 57:25.040
That's right, Poppin' Music appears to be headed towards the Wii, but what's most interesting

57:25.040 --> 57:30.360
about it, the screenshots do not look 100% like the Poppin' Music we know and love right

57:30.360 --> 57:31.360
now.

57:31.360 --> 57:33.160
It looks like, uh, the game could be a little bit different.

57:33.160 --> 57:36.760
Uh, apparently, there might be some online support as well.

57:36.760 --> 57:38.880
Maybe that could be download songs, who knows?

57:38.880 --> 57:43.140
But apparently, even box art has gone up for Japan, and, uh, it does look like it's gonna

57:43.140 --> 57:45.200
bring over a lot of the Japanese characters.

57:45.200 --> 57:49.480
It'll be very interesting to see if this is, uh, debuted at E3, because apparently, the

57:49.480 --> 57:53.360
Wii remote and nunchucks do come into play, which is weird, because they weren't a part

57:53.360 --> 57:54.680
of the original game.

57:54.680 --> 57:59.120
But maybe they're trying to translate this somehow for play with the Wiimotes, and not

57:59.120 --> 58:02.600
the 9 configuration without having to release a new controller.

58:02.600 --> 58:03.600
No idea.

58:03.600 --> 58:04.600
This could be very interesting.

58:04.600 --> 58:07.860
They're not gonna put in, like, like, freestyle mode or anything, are they?

58:07.860 --> 58:08.860
No idea.

58:08.860 --> 58:12.560
Some people are saying maybe it's like a Poppin' Music adventure kind of game, I, I don't,

58:12.560 --> 58:14.560
which is, I guess, a spin-off series that happened in Japan.

58:14.560 --> 58:17.640
I'm not as familiar with it, despite all the Bomani I do know about.

58:17.640 --> 58:21.520
I'm not as familiar with the adventure series, but, uh, apparently, the game is coming out

58:21.520 --> 58:22.520
August 6th.

58:22.520 --> 58:25.400
So, if there is an American version of this coming out, which the trademark would lead

58:25.400 --> 58:27.440
you to believe, we might see it at E3.

58:27.440 --> 58:31.080
That would be very interesting.

58:31.080 --> 58:32.080
That's just bizarre.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.080
Yeah.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.080
Very bizarre.

58:34.080 --> 58:35.080
Who knows?

58:35.080 --> 58:36.080
More to come on this, uh, probably this next week.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.080
We'll see.

58:37.080 --> 58:41.820
Well, I do have sad news for the five people still playing Matrix online.

58:41.820 --> 58:42.820
All five of you.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.440
I'm counting you.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.760
Well, you're SOL now.

58:47.760 --> 58:52.400
It's, uh, actually, you know what?

58:52.400 --> 58:53.400
I picked the wrong thing.

58:53.400 --> 58:54.400
Oh, that's...

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
No, no, yeah, I did.

58:55.400 --> 58:56.400
Sorry.

58:56.400 --> 58:59.400
I did pick the right thing.

58:59.400 --> 59:00.400
Oops!

59:00.400 --> 59:01.400
Live radio!

59:01.400 --> 59:03.400
These things happen sometimes.

59:03.400 --> 59:06.400
Why don't you start it from the top?

59:06.400 --> 59:13.880
Well, um, for the five people who are still playing this, um, sorry, guys, Sony hates

59:13.880 --> 59:15.120
you.

59:15.120 --> 59:16.920
They really do hate you.

59:16.920 --> 59:22.280
Um, actually, uh, Sony of Europe is pulling, um, Matrix online.

59:22.280 --> 59:23.640
It is being shut down.

59:23.640 --> 59:29.680
You, I'm sorry, Sony, I want to say Sony of Europe, uh, Sony Online Entertainment, sorry,

59:29.680 --> 59:32.000
will be, um, closing it down on July 31st.

59:32.000 --> 59:36.720
You better get in your, your Matrixing while you can, and then prepare to swallow your

59:36.720 --> 59:39.040
blue pill.

59:39.040 --> 59:40.560
Before somebody unplugs you.

59:40.560 --> 59:41.560
You're done.

59:41.560 --> 59:42.560
No more.

59:42.560 --> 59:44.760
Wait for private servers to pop up.

59:44.760 --> 59:45.760
I'm not surprised.

59:45.760 --> 59:46.760
Neither am I.

59:46.760 --> 59:47.760
Me neither.

59:47.760 --> 59:48.760
I really didn't realize.

59:48.760 --> 59:49.880
I actually thought it ended a long time ago.

59:49.880 --> 59:50.880
Exactly.

59:50.880 --> 59:52.680
Was that the end of the world event or something in there?

59:52.680 --> 59:53.680
Like a long time?

59:53.680 --> 59:54.680
That was the beta.

59:54.680 --> 59:57.000
Oh, I thought the damn thing was done a long time ago.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.600
I thought so, too, but I think that was just the beta.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600
Yeah.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:08.120
Actually, um, it was, uh, the, Ben Chamberlain, who was the designer in GM, um, was the one

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:12.480
doing all the content updates, the one keeping everything alive, and then he left.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.840
So, um, basically, they're gonna be doing, though, some sort of monumental end of the

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.480
world thing, and then that's it.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.760
They'll do the exact same thing they did for the beta.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.480
I'm, I'm kinda curious here, Gold Anthro is in chat, and apparently, as somewhat of a

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.880
fan of The Matrix Online, says, I was following the story of that.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.800
They could at least finish the story properly, maybe make a second Animatrix collection based

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.000
on the events of the MMO.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Um, but, Jamie, a lot of fun of that game is the story.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
That's why I followed it and tried the free trial.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.680
So, another opinion from chat.orangelandraday.com.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:45.880
I mean, for hardcore fans of The Matrix, to be fair, as much as we're teasing the game,

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.240
because the game itself didn't look to be a lot of fun, at least when I saw Loki playing

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:55.200
it a long time ago, um, it, it was, for fans of The Matrix, they were continually building

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.560
in this, that universe.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.560
They were continually the story.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560
They really were.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.760
Didn't they kill off one of the major characters from the movie, like, in the game or something?

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.440
Uh, I don't, I don't remember, I just, kinda asking that out loud, I'm sure I'd get a response

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.440
from chat.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.660
Really, I didn't keep up with it enough to notice, so.

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.660
Thank you.

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.660
Morpheus, apparently, allegedly died.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.200
I thought one of the main characters there.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.560
Well, who misses him?

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:22.040
Chat.orangelandraday.com, well, if you're a fan of The Matrix series, then you might.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:27.600
So, alright, well, uh, we'll see, um, I guess, uh, if, uh, any pirate servers pop up or what

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.200
the, what game these fans plan to go to, if anything.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200
Yes.

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:38.200
And, as, uh, The Matrix Online dies, another thing comes back from the dead.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200
What?

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:46.000
EGM, actually, is back now, um, to the, you know, praise of many of its fans.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Um, apparently, EGM was sold to its original founder, and, um, he's planning on starting

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.280
a publication in print and as well as online, and, uh, no word yet if, you know, any of

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.420
the staff members that were fired, you know, back when UGO bought up, um, the 1UP brand,

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.060
if they're going to, somehow, um, you know, bring those people back.

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.180
Maybe some people will return back, you know, I'm sure if they're asked, but, um, they have

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:16.120
an exciting plan for, um, you know, taking this magazine to the next evolution, they

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.140
say, so, um, it's interesting, though, because that was actually a pretty good magazine.

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:27.040
With it gone, it's pretty much just Game Informer, which is in bed.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.300
You know, um, is there a lot, now, an interesting question is, playing devil's advocate here,

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.760
especially in this economy, in this world we live in, with the internet and everything,

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.860
is there a demand for print publication?

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.880
I think, well, I mean, like, Game Informer's pretty good.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:46.000
Um, you know, I, if, I wouldn't probably voluntarily sign up for it, unless, you know, I get the

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.400
discount cards through GameStop, and that's really the only incentive, but, um, you know,

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.360
they've had a lot of exclusive stories lately, and probably because they're GameStop and

01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.600
can afford to say, hey, give us the exclusive story on this, or, um, you know, we won't

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.800
buy as much, you know, that type of stuff, so.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.840
Which has to violate some type of antitrust law, just by the way.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.840
Or it could be the other way around.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.640
It could be that they're giving them that because they're like, hey, look at, you know,

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:17.080
our user base, you know, for this magazine, it's huge, and yeah, it is huge because you,

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:22.400
you get it when you sign up for this card that basically pays for itself pretty quick.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.400
I don't know.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.680
Um, it's not bad, but still, I think there is room for more, you know, gaming publications

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
out there.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.560
I mean, hell, I mean, EGM hasn't even gone that long.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.520
Well, you know what, one thing I am gonna appreciate for Electronic Gaming Monthly being

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520
back is that now-

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.360
You're a game pro if you need to get rid of one.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.520
One thing I do miss about Electronic Gaming Monthly is that now I'll have something to

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:48.380
read on the shitter again, because what a better, what better place to read video gaming

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:52.380
magazines, because, you know, certainly some of the articles in Electronic Gaming Monthly

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:58.760
make me want to facilitate release, so I'm extremely happy that I will have a new bathroom

01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.760
reader.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.420
Rob, you're such a goof.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.420
So there you go.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.720
EGM coming soon to a bathroom near you.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.960
Hey, uh, hopefully not gonna end up in your bathroom, but in your, uh, console.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:17.160
Squeenix has a brand new, believe it or not, it's not Final Fantasy XIV, it's not, you

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.000
know, Kingdom Hearts XI, it is a brand new franchise, it's something called N.I.E.R.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Nier, although that might be a little bit deceptive, because I guess it's like a new

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.400
type of front mission game.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.400
No, no.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.400
There's two different games.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.400
Oh, okay.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400
It's two different ones.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.400
Phew.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.400
Okay, so N.I.E.R.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400
Nier is, uh, one of the, oh, okay, I see what you're saying.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.760
It's a hack and slash action game, it looks fucking awesome.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.760
Really?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.760
I didn't look at the videos of this yet.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.760
Yeah, you need to.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.760
What's it kinda look like?

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:47.960
Um, I don't know, it's just, it's really like, um, like a bloody action game, I mean, you

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.760
know, there's not, it's not like a Castlevania or anything like that, it's just really cool

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760
looking.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.480
Well apparently this is a game being developed by the Bullet Witch and Resident Evil Umbrella

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:05.120
Chronicles Makers, same folks who made those games, but it wasn't Bullet Witch kinda, no.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.520
I hope they learn their lesson, because, uh, see, it kinda sucks, because Umbrella Chronicles

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:17.520
wasn't that bad, but Bullet Witch was really fucking bad, so, uh, that's tough.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.940
By the way, just kind of on a side note, this is a Final Fantasy and the PSP bundle that

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.720
will be coming with it, August 25th.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.640
Yeah, the new front mission game that's coming out is gonna be a little bit different, because

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.160
you remember, front mission is more of a tactical strategy game, whereas this one's gonna be

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:35.080
like Armored Core, it's just, you know, get in the mech, kill things, which I can get

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.080
behind that.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.920
Shadow Next Gen in chat says, I want Kingdom Hearts 3, dammit.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920
You know what, me too.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.300
Like, I know they have these spin-off games coming this year, and sadly I think that's

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:47.260
all we're gonna get is the DS and PSP Kingdom Hearts games that, you know, I think the ones

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:50.840
that are coming out in Japan are gonna come here too inevitably, but you know what, Disney

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.960
has a huge booth at E3 this year, and granted I know they have all their little, you know,

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.360
Hannah Montana and, you know, whatever type games that they do, which is probably in reality

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.520
all you're gonna see there, there's a part of me that just really hopes maybe Kingdom

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.880
Hearts 3 is a surprise announcement.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.600
They have split second, which looks awesome.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.440
At least something, throw me a frickin' bone here, show me a new teaser trailer, give me

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.060
something to look forward to in 2010 after Final Fantasy 13 is out.

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.000
You know, I would hope if nothing else, if they do the whole Square Theater or whatever

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.200
again, that we see a little bit of a tease of Kingdom Hearts 3.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.960
Well, Square likes to tease games that aren't coming out for a few years anyway, so...

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.720
And that's all I'm asking for.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.840
Just let me know it's really happening.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.380
Remind me that Kingdom Hearts 3 is happening, remind me that you're not gonna do this weird

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:40.120
ass spinoff that makes no sense to a seven year old like you were trying to show at the

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.720
end of Kingdom Hearts 2, like, remember that?

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.720
That was awesome.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.560
It was awesome, but what the fuck did it have to do with Disney?

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.560
Nothing.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560
Show me...

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.120
What does Kingdom Hearts really have to do with Disney?

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.160
Not a lot, but dammit, it gives me something to look forward to.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.440
I'm surprised we haven't seen anything Kingdom Hearts related in Disneyland.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:02.400
Well, that's a whole nother story, because technically it's licensed, it's not a part

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.640
of Disney, so you don't really see, I mean, but in Japan, apparently they have more, and

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:12.360
I'll tell you what, one time, I think I told this on the show, one trip I took to Disneyland,

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.960
was it with you, Darkseid, or was it...

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:15.960
I don't remember when it was.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:20.600
I don't remember if it was this March or if it was last, the time before, but we actually

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.320
saw a little kid dressed up as Sora.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Yeah, we did.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320
In the park.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320
In a haunted mansion.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.320
I thought I was with you.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.040
We saw him in line for a haunted mansion, so sometimes you see it, you know, I don't

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.720
know, but it's just, you know, random.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.200
Because remember they were from Australia or something, and the costume was really well

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.200
done.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200
That was right.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.200
And then they asked him to leave.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.080
No, they didn't ask him, because you're allowed to be dressed up in the park if you're a kid.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.080
Yep.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:46.140
So, anyhow, I've ever seen one thing in the park, Kingdom Hearts related, one thing, official

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.700
Disney in the park, and that was a California venture in the collectible store they were

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.920
selling where they sell all the little mini statues, I saw as Sora.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.760
That's the only thing I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.760
Really?

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.760
Yes.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:58.760
I haven't seen that at all.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760
Yes.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.760
And it was gone when I looked again this last time I was there.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:05.000
So, I guess it's kind of like Where's Waldo across two theme parks.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Where's Sora.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Where's Sora.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Good luck.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.280
Anyhow, more stories, if we could.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.520
Dark Sakura.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:19.240
Well, as I mentioned, I believe it was last week, there was the rumor about Wolfenstein

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:26.880
3D coming out, and it is going to be on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.360
It will be June 4th and June 5th, respectively.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.440
That means Xbox fans get it first.

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.440
Ha ha.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.240
Bringing it home.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.240
Huh?

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.640
That's part of the E3 is bringing it home, or, you know, where Microsoft does that bringing

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.640
it home thing.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.640
Oh, okay.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640
They have demos.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.240
I bet you anything we're going to see a Lost Planet 2 demo coming this week, since they

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.800
said they were going to do that anyways.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.160
Maybe I'll get some cool new shirts for my avatar, whoopty shit.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:09:02.120
But there will be, actually, um, of course, achievements, whatever you want to call it.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:07.520
And also for the new Wolfenstein game, there's going to be, um, you can earn accolades and

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.880
be awarded gold for customizable weapon upgrades for the new Wolfenstein, so that'll be pretty

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880
cool.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.760
And that, of course, is coming out on August 4th.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.160
No idea on price yet.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.160
Sorry.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.160
I don't know.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.160
It'll probably be 10 bucks.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160
They're all 10 bucks.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160
I want to shoot Hitler in the head.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160
They're all, I, I...

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160
It should be five bucks.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.840
I want to shoot a giant pixelated Hitler.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.400
I mean, Wolfenstein 3D, honestly, I, unless they did something really cool with this,

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.240
which I, you know, I heard about the whole integration with the new Wolfenstein or whatever,

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.000
I'm sorry, that's not enough, unless they did something really fucking cool, like suddenly

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.480
put multiplayer in it somehow, which I doubt they did, I don't think it's worth it, because

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.800
if the game was not that great by today's standards, was it an important and revolutionary

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.380
game at the time, yes, but does it hold up to today's standards?

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.380
Hell the fuck no.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.880
You are going to download this and be, why did I waste $10?

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.120
Remember PUBGAMES Fable 2?

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.680
Remember how that was going to integrate stuff?

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.920
Remember how crappy those were?

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.920
Yeah.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.920
I don't, I'm not falling for that twice.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920
Sorry.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.640
Um, I'm going to get it.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.480
I love, I freaking love Wolfenstein.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.640
I love Doom, and I also love Duke Nukem 3D.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.600
Bought both of those, played them for about, you know, 30 minutes, and then that was it.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.600
You're like, yay, nostalgia.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.020
Okay, done now.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.720
I will, I will bet money.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.160
I will bet money Dark Soccer does the same thing.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.200
She'll buy it, play it for 30 minutes, and be done.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.800
No, that is if I actually go through with buying it.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.800
And it's nothing against, I'm just saying, it's the same thing, the same nostalgia bug,

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.000
the same nostalgia bug that, that, that you and me.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.120
Honestly, honestly, honestly, this is really what I'm going to do is probably just freaking

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.160
download it and play it on my computer like, you know, God intended.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.080
Marissa Cunguso in chat says, anyone remember Heretic?

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.400
Hell yeah, I'm sorry, I was the big Hexen fan.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:55.160
Now if, if that and Hexen come out on Xbox Live, we will play that for hours, guaranteed.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.440
We'll just, we will stream it on the internet to prove it.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.400
I will go on leave from work and play it.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.760
We will play like eight, eight hours of that game on a weekend.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.800
We will, we will do it.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.320
I will watch Rob do it too.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.200
Gee, thanks.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.200
You're a real pal.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.200
No, I will.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.200
I'd play.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.200
I'd do it.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.200
All right, good.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.200
Cause I might want to like sleep at some point or eat.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.200
I don't know.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200
During those eight hours.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200
You're not allowed to eat anymore, Rob.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.040
If you release what Heretic or Hexen or both or which one?

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.080
They should do a pack.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.040
All right, so if Heretic and Hexen come out on Xbox Live Arcade, Dark Soccer and I will

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.560
do an eight hour marathon.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.560
We will.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.560
We will.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.200
No, we will do a 24 hour marathon.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200
No.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200
Yes.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.960
We will do the Uber marathon.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.160
Is there enough gameplay to last for 24 hours?

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.160
I guess.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160
We'll find a way.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.160
All right.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160
Isn't there like multiple episodes or something?

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.160
All right.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.680
Look, there are too many bets being made tonight and I'm really afraid, I'm really afraid the

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.280
public is going to win one of them.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.560
So you know what, Rob, you know what my, my thought is on bets?

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
What?

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.240
I never intend on going through with them, so why?

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240
You're a bad bet maker.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.160
I fully intended on going through with the Eye of Judgment thing.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.400
If somebody says, Hey, we heard about this bet, we just sold another 750,000 copies of

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.040
it, which will never happen.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.900
But if it did, then yes, I would go through with the bet.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.480
He would have done it and it would have, you wouldn't have half asked it either.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.400
It would have been to the wife would have made the costume.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.520
It would have been tremendous things that could have been, but no, nobody had to buy

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.520
Eye of Judgment.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.440
We're even going to have him go through the happy tingle dance.

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:30.640
When Loki makes the bet, he makes the damn bet.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640
He's a man.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.640
I will say this.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.760
I was done the show with Loki a long time, known the man many years.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.120
He is a man of his word.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.840
And God forbid they try to make a sequel.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.720
And no, I don't think I will, I don't know whether, we'll have to look at this.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.000
Yeah, it depends whether you don't say anything until you see, because the sequel could be

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.480
cool if there is one.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.680
So you want to just, you want to watch it, Loki.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.840
Watch it.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.640
Something that probably will be cool, but I won't be picking it up.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.640
Guitar Hero 5.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.440
It will be coming out a little bit earlier this year, September 1st.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.640
And of course, you know, new to Guitar Hero 5 will be a new party play mode where you

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.280
mix up what instruments you have.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.980
And also, you know, kind of, I think drop in and drop out play as well, which is kind

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.520
of sweet.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.800
And there's also a confirmation, a full confirmation of all the artists that will be featured in

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.120
the game.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.840
And actually a pretty long list.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:30.280
Even there's some that I wouldn't have thought would normally be in, in like Guitar Hero.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.900
Like we had the Gorillaz, which was in there, confirmed.

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.440
I mean, that's, do they have any really guitar friendly songs?

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.280
Well, yeah.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:53.040
I mean, let's see here, Blur, Blink-182, Iron Maiden, Duran Duran, Tom Petty, Nirvana, Smashing

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.920
Pumpkins, David Bowie, Johnny Cash.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:03.880
One that made me excited, Rammstein is going to be in there, Beck, Garbage, Billy Idol,

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.880
finally.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.880
One that made me perk up.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.880
I love Garbage.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.880
Queen and David Bowie.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.880
Okay.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.880
Oh.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.880
That means you're getting under pressure.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.880
Under pressure?

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.880
Probably.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.880
Oh.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.480
I just bought Guitar Hero 5, son of a bitch.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.480
Son of a bitch.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.660
That's like the one song I have to have.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.660
You all know it.

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.660
You out there listening.

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:26.680
You know there is that one song you have to have if you haven't already got it.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.460
There's that one song you have to have that's going to make you buy the game regardless.

01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:31.460
And he just said it.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.460
Elton John.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:39.800
Oh man, there's like, I don't know, it looks pretty cool in deep purple.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.160
So maybe we'll get Highway Star in there again.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.960
I love Highway Star.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.960
Alright.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.960
Sweet.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.760
And that's just a selection of some of the stuff there, but they have the full list that's

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760
out there now.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:54.920
Apparently it was leaked out by a UK magazine, I believe the UK equivalent to like Rolling

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.720
Stone or something posted the full list.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.800
But we'll hear more about Guitar Hero 5 and you'll actually get to see it.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.200
In a few days.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.600
Alright well we got just a little more news for you and then we're going to get to the

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.440
classic game of the week and this has to do with Nintendo.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.000
Now the leaks aren't just kept to Sony.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.480
Nintendo might have leaked some things out thanks to some trademarks they've been filing.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.600
One of the trademarks that have been filed, Wii Fit Plus.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.560
Now here's the thing, apparently this was already found out a few months ago through

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.560
some retailer listings, but now this title has officially been trademarked in Japan.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.440
There's also a logo to go with it, so you know what?

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.840
This is probably something you're going to see at E3.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:42.960
In fact, apparently some news leaks have come out of E3 that apparently yes, Wii Fit Plus

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.480
is a real deal.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.160
Wii Motion Plus is going to be supported.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.260
That's a big part of this game is that now they'll be able to detect the motion a little

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:54.040
better and it's going to have online functionality.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.800
Very limited online functionality.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.440
This is probably just sharing data across the internet so you can motivate each other.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.600
Which is okay.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.400
It's not something to buy the game over, but I got to be honest, I think a lot of people

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:11.580
give Wii Fit a really hard time because we're core gamers, but if you look at this from

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:17.880
the perspective of it gets people up off the couch and it's not boring.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.000
I was playing Wii Fit religiously for a couple weeks.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.760
I really need to get back into doing it.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.320
I fell out of the habit and I shouldn't have done that.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.440
Next to going to a gym, it's not a bad thing.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.320
I got to say, I'm very interested in Wii Fit Plus.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.000
As embarrassed as I am to say it, I'm interested to see what they do with it.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.240
I know, and that's kind of cool that they're putting out another game that some of these

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.680
people that bought Wii Fit are going to buy, but they just keep putting out sequels to

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.920
games that they already have.

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:50.580
Yes, I know that everybody releases sequels, but my god, okay, seriously, let's see here.

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:52.420
Wii Sports Resort.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:57.020
Wii Sports 2 basically, which has games that repeat themselves.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.020
Hold up though.

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:02.160
Wii Sports, like if it's not the top selling console game of all time at this point, one

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.160
of the top.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.160
Come on.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160
Give them.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.160
They've got to have a Wii Sports 2.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.700
That may be true.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:10.920
You know there's going to be a Mario, which by the way, next part of the story, rumor

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.520
is the Mario is the big unveiling at E3, the new Mario game.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.480
Why aren't we seeing anything new?

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.480
Anything innovative?

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:20.400
It's basically just rehashes of old stuff.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.520
Because rehashes are what people want to see.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.520
Guess what?

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.560
We could have had more motion sensors, but we were cheap and decided not to put in there,

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.760
but hey, now if you buy this, buy more accessories that we're going to sell you now, you can

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.260
buy the same game again with now some online functionality, which should have been in there

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:42.360
in the first place, and you can have some enhanced motion capturing that should have

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.520
been in there in the first place.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.680
Awesome.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.760
I get to pay for your mistakes.

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.760
Again.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:53.000
Oh wait, no, I don't have to because I'm not buying it.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Comments from chat.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Chat.orensondrader.com.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Tell us what you really feel.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.720
Entertainment says next year they'll have Wii Fit++ with Wii Motion Plus, Wii Vision

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.360
Plus and Wii Internet Plus.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.920
Marissa Congusto says, I refer back to my old comment that video games are turning into

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.660
porns with multiple sequels and endless sequel numbers.

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.560
Same content, different cast.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:16.080
INGN0, I think Ingo I can say, I'm not sure if there's a pronunciation of that and I forgot

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.080
it.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:18.080
Sorry.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:24.240
The only non-Nintendo game that is good on the Wii is Mad World.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.960
By the way, one other thing I wanted to say, one other game that was trademarked by Nintendo,

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.960
Art Academy.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.000
So, maybe that's something new.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Question mark.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Hope it's Mario Paint 2.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
That would be cool.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Okay, well wait a minute!

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.440
You just said you didn't want to see sequels, and now you're like, give me Mario Paint 2!

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.020
That would be new though, okay?

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.020
That would be new.

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.120
They could do more innovative stuff with Mario Paint 2.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.240
Now if they just put Mario Paint, new Wii control, you know, Mario Paint or whatever,

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.280
with the Wii controls now to the old game, then yes, that would be rehash crap.

01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.200
But this is basically Wii Fit, you know, maybe they'll have some different mini games in

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.200
there.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.200
Whoopee!

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.200
You know?

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.720
And they're gonna just, you know, throw it back at the consumer again.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.720
And guess what?

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:12.360
The Nintendo consumer's dumb enough to buy this stuff again, and so the cycle will never

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.560
end, and the people who actually want to play good games on the system will never get to

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.680
play those good games.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:19.180
So you know what?

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.680
You just have to move on.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.680
Which I have.

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.560
Rama in chat says, with all these motion controller adapters, it's just a matter of time before

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.560
we see masturbation in the game.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.400
And that is what we're hoping to see from the Korean developers at E3, and damn it,

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.400
if masturbation in the game is at E3, OLR will bring it to you, because no one else

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.400
will.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.800
No one else will want to.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:45.000
No one else will want to touch it, literally.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.560
Fanboy wank the game!

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.840
We did play 3 Feel that one time.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:55.320
I, we did, we extensively covered 3 Feel on this show, and what the hell ever happened

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.320
to that game?

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.800
That's what I love about E3, I'll play all these games, I will never fucking see them.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.520
Whatever happened to that one game that was like a 360 game about some guy that was like

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:06.640
Spring Break or something, you can go on panty raids and stuff like that.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.600
Remember, whatever happened to that?

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.600
I don't know.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.600
You know what did come out?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.600
Tulip came out.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.800
Tulip did come out, finally.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800
The smooching game.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800
After like two years.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.800
And X-Tango!

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.840
Still no X-Tango.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840
We need an X-Tango!

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.840
I'm sorry.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840
That game had so much potential.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.800
We should go hold these people down and go, why the hell haven't you released your game,

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.800
you lazy bastard?

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.120
Give me some X-Tango or I'll smack you down.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.120
Hey, look.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.120
Hold on, guys.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.120
Hold on.

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.120
Serious moment here.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.280
The reality of the situation is none of those games could get picked up because the fact

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.720
people are wanting their Mario 2s and people are wanting more of the same thing.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:40.840
The, the, the, serious guys.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.720
That's why these games fizzled because they couldn't get the backing.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.840
No they could have put out an Xbox Live Arcade.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840
They could easily do that.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:47.840
They weren't XNA.

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.240
Well, define easily.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:51.000
The money dries up at some point.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Who's paying for it?

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The game's done.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Just port it.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
They just need a distributor.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.060
Somebody has to port it.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.400
You have to pay someone to port it.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:59.200
It's not just Presto Chainjo.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.200
It's on Xbox Live.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:01.200
Yes it is.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.200
There are small game publishers out there that will do that.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:08.360
I mean, there, there's people picking up rights to like M&Ms and fucking Jelly Belly and stuff

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.880
because they think that's an awesome IP.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.880
Oh my god, it's recognizable.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.960
Because people buy that shit.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:18.360
I mean, if I put out a game that was like Nabisco something or other, I mean, no one's

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.760
gonna pick that up.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:25.960
Lego My Eggo, you know, the game, I mean, Nabisco presents X-Tango.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.200
I would pay, I would play Nabisco presents X-Tango.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:33.360
You know, it's like, uh, Dancing for Oreos.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.560
I would play Cookie Dancing the game.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:39.960
Purina Dogchow presents, you know, it's like, oh great, X-Alpo.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960
X-Alpo.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.920
Anyways, I'm gonna look and see what happened to 3-Feel.

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:46.920
Please do.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.280
I want you, will you do that during the break?

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.280
Will you try to research?

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.240
I want to find out what happened to 3-Feel, X-Tango, and uh, what was the other one?

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.960
Anything, anything that we've talked about from the old Kinsha Hall's day, because it's

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:01.440
been like three years since we've been to an E3 because we didn't get invited the hotel

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.440
years.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.440
So the years that don't count.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:04.440
All right.

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.600
Look, we got, uh, the classic game of the week we got to get to.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.520
We got to find out what's happened to some really old games.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.520
Really old?

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520
How old is really old?

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.520
Dark, I don't know.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.520
I guess it's all relative.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.640
Dark Sakura is going to dig through her archive of games and find a game to highlight just

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:21.440
for you guys and what the heck is going on with it.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.160
It's called the classic game of the week.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.760
Here it is here on Orange Launch Radio.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.800
What is the classic game of the week that all the kids should be playing, Dark Sakura?

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:33.520
The classic game of the week is, I'm actually going into the arcade archives.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.440
Even though there were home releases of this, I'm gonna really focus on the arcade version,

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.320
and that's a game called Star Blade.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:53.000
And yeah, I put up our customary, you know, audio thing, but for when it came out, that's

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.600
a pretty good audio.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:07.800
So this particular game was in a special pod cabinet put out by Namco, and it was running

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:12.320
on the Namco System 21 hardware at the time.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:18.040
This game came out when I think I was still in, yeah I was still in high school, it came

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.480
out in 1991, and I was all over this game.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:29.320
My dollar theater had it, and the guys there used to put it on free play for me.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.720
So I have beaten Star Blade a number of times.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:39.320
But the way that it goes is you have a really large 2-axis 4-button controller with an LED

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320
lamp.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.520
So basically, you flash it as you shoot them.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:52.760
When you get hit, the seat rumbles and you get strobes going off, so that it would be

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:58.080
like you actually saw the lasers hitting you, you'd be temporarily blinded, you know, just

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.160
like you would with a photo flash.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:10.360
It also had a 30 VDC motor that had an asymmetrical axis, so the seating effect, the shaking would

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:13.480
be really random, it was on three cylinders.

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:17.880
But yeah, it is a shoot-em-up game.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:21.960
You are flying out through space and you're shooting all the bad guys.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:27.560
They have big flashing red sections kind of like it did in Star Fox.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:32.480
But basically, you just go around and just shoot stuff.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.480
It's a lot of fun.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.760
It's a lot, a lot of fun.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.180
Really kind of a difficult game, too.

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:42.880
This kind of looks very Star Wars-ish to me, like the Star Wars arcade game that they had

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.600
out looks a little bit like it.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.680
It just kind of reminds me of it, the way it's set up.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.680
A little bit.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.360
There's actually got some more interesting stuff to it, though.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.840
Just to go into the sound, it actually had this four-speaker surround sound, even though

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:02.720
it was only two-channel, they had it to where it would go through four speakers, so it was

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:03.720
pretty cool.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:13.400
Now, this is the fun thing, is that we got this on Sega CD and 3DO in 1994 in its original

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.880
way it looked.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:23.160
However, on PlayStation we got Starblade Alpha, which had a textured mode.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.000
You could play it with textures or whatever.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.320
Before it was just like, you know, basic.

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.320
Very Star Fox.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320
Imagine Star Fox.

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.320
That's what the graphics look like.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.320
I know we're radio.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.320
Imagine Star Fox.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.320
Thank you, Cleaner.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.320
Yeah.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.320
You know.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.280
But it's a really fantastic game.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:45.120
Now here's the fun thing about it, it actually had another incarnation called Galaxian 3

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.120
Project Dragoon.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.840
Do you remember anything about that?

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.280
No, but I wanted to say really quick.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.320
No wonder we go in the big room and play it.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.920
I can see this game's influence on Star Fox.

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.600
This game looks a lot like Star Fox to me.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:01.360
Like it's a mix of Star Wars the arcade game and Star Fox.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.320
I never played this game back in the day, but it looks a lot like it.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.400
Like just the graphics, the way things flash that you are supposed to target and kill.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400
Wow.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:18.080
Well, Galaxian 3 is a walk-in style game that runs off a laserdisc and the arcade hardware,

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.440
so it has some pre-rendered stuff going on in the background.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.240
It's super awesome, too.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:28.760
But it was out for Namco's Theater 6 arcade system, which the only other game that came

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.520
out was Attack of the Zul'gir.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:36.360
The cool thing about this, though, is that actually a lot of the audio from Star Blade

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:39.680
made it into Galaxian 3.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:45.240
The path of the game is almost identical, you know, through the asteroid field with

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.040
battleships going through the planet, desert canyons, blah, blah, blah.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.520
And the music in it was a rearrangement of Star Blade.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.000
So Star Blade led directly to Galaxian 3.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.440
It's a predecessor.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:10.560
Also, do you know how Tekken 5 had their loading screens that had different games?

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.540
Star Blade was in Tekken 5, so that always made me go for it.

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.400
Someone in chat actually recognized that, too.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.880
And it was unlockable in the arcade history area of the game.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.840
And Star Blade also shows up in Ridge Racer 7 as a wheels manufacturer, so it has wheels

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.840
from the game.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:35.680
There was supposed to be a sequel to it that was called Star Blade Operation Blue Planet,

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.960
but the game never made production.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:46.720
It was supposed to be running on the Namco Orbs cabinet with a projector and a slide-in

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.440
scene and everything, so it was supposed to be pretty neat.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.280
But it never happened, which is a damn shame, fie!

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.720
But that's totally my game of the week.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:02.520
Alright, there you have it, your classic game of the week, Star Blade, on the arcade.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.040
I'm sorry, that's a game that still, I think, holds solid today.

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.440
It may look a little dated, but if you can find one in the cabinet, plunk the money into

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.880
it, it's well worth it.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880
Alright.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.080
It's a very well-received pick by the chat room as well, a lot of fans of that game in

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.080
chat.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.720
It is seriously, for arcade games, it's one of my favorites.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:22.720
Alright.

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:24.800
Well, we are going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.760
I need to rest my voice, I need to get some more tea or something hot to drink, because

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.920
you can hear I'm getting the whole puberty thing going on again.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:30.920
I have tons of tea.

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:34.120
And we're going to rest a little bit, our voices, take a quick break, come back in Part

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:38.120
B. We haven't even touched Microsoft News yet, and believe me, there's a lot of it,

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.120
so we're going to get to that after the break.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:40.760
And of course, your call's a little later on.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.160
It's probably going to be a bit of a long show tonight, so buckle up and hold on.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.800
We'll get through it together, guys.

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:55.720
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.280
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.180
31st of 2009, where we are taping live on All Games Radio, as we do every Sunday night.

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.280
The fun begins around 6 o'clock Pacific, but sometimes we're on the phone with Bobby Blackwolf,

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:12.080
the guy who goes before us with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and it will cause

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.360
us to start a little late, is what happened tonight.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360
But that's OK.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.480
We've still got plenty of stuff to talk to you guys about, so let's get right back into

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.480
it.

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.480
Enough BS.

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.240
Hopefully, you've already heard Part A. I don't know why you would.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.160
I guess maybe if you're joining us late here live on this Sunday evening, then shame on

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.840
you for missing Part A, but you missed a lot about Sony and Nintendo.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.240
Now we're going to get into Microsoft News, right, Logie?

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:33.240
Yes.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.520
The rumored Zune HD is real.

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:44.600
Microsoft has now officially unveiled it, and what it will do is also tie the Zune Marketplace

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:48.400
into the Xbox 360, which is going to be pretty cool.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:55.680
They're actually planning on mainly adding, I think, the music portion of the Zune Marketplace,

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:03.200
perhaps showing you how to buy the Zune Pass and stuff like that, so you can download songs.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:08.960
Also they're going to have, you know, maybe a different music service on top of that that's

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:14.520
going to be similar to the Zune Marketplace for the 360, which is kind of cool.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.080
And the system itself actually looks pretty, like, sleeker.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.080
I don't know.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.680
It looks kind of neat, and a lot bigger screen.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680
I don't know.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680
It's pretty cool.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.440
I'm sure they're going to show a little bit, I mean, even though it's not really gaming,

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.560
they may show a little bit more of it during a Microsoft press conference tomorrow, but

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.560
I don't know.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.560
It looks kind of cool.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.560
I kind of want to get one.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560
Really?

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560
Maybe.

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.560
I don't know.

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.080
I have my new stereo in the car.

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:52.760
This is interesting, though, from you, because you usually are not a big portable person.

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:56.440
I know you have a lot of iPhone hate, but it would be interesting to see you get the

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:58.480
Zune out of all this.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:01.360
What is it about this that makes you excited?

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:09.080
Well, apparently they're going to integrate the Zune into Xbox Live, creating a game-changing

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:13.560
entertainment experience, as they say, but that could be just a whole bunch of PR fluff.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:14.560
I don't know.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.280
I have to see what functions they're actually going to do.

01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:19.800
Remember, they were talking back before that they're going to have X and A games available

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.400
to play on the Zune, so that might be kind of cool.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.400
I don't know.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.400
We'll see.

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.520
I probably won't end up actually getting one, but it would be neat to see what they're going

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.640
to offer for it.

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:30.640
All right.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:36.000
Well, I guess we will see what happens as more is revealed on the Zune HD.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.980
I'm sure this is going to be one of the big things at Microsoft's press conference, which

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:44.600
is weird, though, because this is not necessarily games unless they're going to be talking about

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:46.880
the gaming aspect of it, right?

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.880
Probably, yeah.

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.880
I hope it's something.

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:50.880
Yeah.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.640
Well, I'm sure they've got lots of stuff in here to compete with.

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:59.200
I'm sure they're going to try to do something like X and A for the Zune.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.680
It only makes sense because they'd be competing with Apple in that sense, because they're

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:12.840
going to have a marketplace that has applications and games similar to the Apple App Store.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.600
Most importantly, however, will it blend?

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.600
That's the big question.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.600
Always blends.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.600
That's right.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:19.600
All right.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.080
Well, hey, Microsoft might be up to something else.

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.680
Apparently, there's some ads out there on Microsoft's careers site.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:29.480
If you want to get a job with Microsoft, you can go to this website and look for possible

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.480
careers.

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.800
Apparently, one thing they are looking for right now, an engineer that will be working

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.640
on a game to support up to 300,000 players in real time.

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.640
No way.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.000
Apparently, Microsoft is building an extremely high-performance system to extend console

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.640
games to the server in new ways, creating a completely new set of web services.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.440
What's interesting about it, when I first looked at this, I was like, oh, big deal.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.960
It's probably a computer game or something else.

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.440
But no, apparently, it is something that is going to be integrating into the console.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:00.840
Could this be for some type of future NXC enhancement with all the avatars and what

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.840
have you?

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.240
What with all this now 1 versus 100 and all these live things, maybe they are looking

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.600
for something massive.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:08.600
Who knows?

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.280
Or are they building some competition for PlayStation Home?

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.100
That could be.

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.600
Or is it a little bit of both?

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.600
Who knows?

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.600
Could be very interesting.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.400
I don't really know why they would need to make competition for PlayStation Home.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.400
I don't think...

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.400
I don't know.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:27.760
Well, maybe they will do the things that Sony should have done with Home.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.320
You know, Sony has kind of been a lot of big talk.

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:33.560
They've been talking about how you're going to launch games from within Home.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.880
They've been talking about that trophy room where you're going to show off all your trophies.

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.880
Yet, we have yet to see all of that.

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.360
I mean, I guess they do have the launching of the games now built in.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.780
But I got to be honest, it's a little clunky.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:47.400
And how many people do you honestly know that are going to sit down at the Sony PlayStation

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:51.480
and go, okay, I'm going to go into Home to launch this game, right?

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:55.400
Nobody really does that, except maybe the one time to check out how it works.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:34:01.940
You know, there isn't a lot of draw in Home to make that the place I start my gaming experience

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.980
right now.

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:06.880
Maybe Microsoft, if they build this into a future NXC, is going to make something like

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:10.120
Home the place to start your gaming experience.

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.680
Well, they're going to have to do a lot.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:20.040
Well, Son of Dad in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com suggests XBLA announces Uno clusterfuck.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.200
And Act Def says, I would play Uno clusterfuck.

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.040
I would check out Uno clusterfuck.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.360
I would play Uno clusterfuck.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.800
I could be with 300,000 people all at once.

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.960
Draw four, bitches.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.960
I could see that.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:32.960
Uno clusterfuck.

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:35.000
That'd be fun.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.160
So we'll see what happens.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.720
I doubt this will be an announcement at E3 this year anyway.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:40.720
Maybe next year.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:41.720
Who knows?

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:42.720
Oh, maybe.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:44.720
Well, how about some other stuff though?

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720
How about it?

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:46.720
How about betas?

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.720
Beta, beta, betas.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:50.760
Aw, I thought you couldn't get those anymore.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.040
It was all VHS now.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.320
But I'm pumped.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:58.760
This was me blinking at Rob.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.880
There was the one versus 100 beta.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:03.460
It was going on in Canada.

01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:05.760
Or as some people say, Canadian.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.200
I say Canada.

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:12.320
It is supposed to be though coming to America as of June 1st.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.680
So if anyone cares, there you go.

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:18.560
Microsoft's bringing it home, beta style.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.640
And all of us that are traveling to E3 won't get a chance to play this really unless we

01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:23.040
bring our Xboxes with us.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.040
So which I'm not.

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.880
I suppose I could try playing it.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.400
Yeah, but weren't you asking me before the show, what the hell is this?

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.280
I've been hearing about it and honestly, I was like, I don't care.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:33.800
But have you ever seen the game show?

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.240
No, I don't want TV.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.240
Because it wasn't that great.

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.920
I mean, for one, it wasn't that great.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.260
But if you heard a lot of good things about it, would you watch it maybe?

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.260
Check it out?

01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:44.260
No.

01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:45.260
You didn't have that hose with us.

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:46.260
He's not doing anything.

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:47.360
He just goes to E3.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.520
But I mean, I think we can all agree the idea, this whole idea, despite the fact that the

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.860
game show itself might not have been that much fun to watch, to actually get to play

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:57.840
it on Xbox Live might be kind of cool.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.720
I know I'm looking forward to it.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.440
I didn't sneak into the Canada beta or anything.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.080
I heard about all these people sneaking in.

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:05.660
I'm just like, big effing deal.

01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.960
You can wait a couple weeks, right?

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.120
I would like to quote a line from Wayne's World.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.120
Yes.

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.720
Monkeys might fly out of my butt.

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.680
So you don't see yourself playing it?

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.680
No.

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.680
Nah.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.180
Redertainment says, am I only going to be able to play 1 versus 100 only at a set time

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.180
during the day?

01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:21.180
Yeah.

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.560
I think that's how I understand it's set up, right?

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.560
Like, they have showtimes.

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.600
But I think it's not like they only let 101 people in.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.680
No, it's people in the audience.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.500
There's also the actual mob, which is 100 people.

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:35.320
And then there's the player.

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.520
Interesting.

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:40.720
So I would have thought maybe they have 30 different games, but they're all going at

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.960
the same time.

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.520
That way everybody gets to be in the mob.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.160
But they're not going to do it that way, huh?

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.040
No, it doesn't quite work like that.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.840
I think you have to register or something.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.620
Well, that sucks.

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.720
What if I want to actually get to play the game?

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.720
Fat chance, right?

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.720
No!

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.720
You will not.

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.080
This is where the 300,000 comes in.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:03.600
Son of Dad says, only good thing about 1 versus 100 is Bob Saget, who will not be a part of

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.600
this.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.920
Black Wolf is correcting us, saying no registration.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:12.520
The reason there's a showtime is because there's a live host who conducts interviews.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.520
That's kind of cool.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.520
Screw the live host.

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.520
We don't need a live host.

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.520
Well, I mean, no.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.520
I like the idea of a live host.

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:18.520
I just kind of thought...

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.520
I don't know.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:20.520
I thought...

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:21.520
Just outsource it to India.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.520
...to a conference.

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.520
Oh, God.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.520
So we can have it 24 hours.

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.520
We can do a match.

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:26.520
Wow.

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:30.160
I don't know who you are anymore.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.440
But I would have thought maybe there'd be like 30 games going on at once.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:38.440
And Black Wolf says they are going to have other games during the week where you are

01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:41.400
in an automated game as you play those.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.400
So OK.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:46.160
So they'll have like their big live event and then some other games throughout the week.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160
I don't know.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.380
I'm curious to see how this all comes together.

01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:52.800
That still earns me the who cares award of the week.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.800
I'd care.

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800
I'm a big fan of game shows.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800
You know what?

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.800
I want to check this out.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.800
I would be all over what?

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.920
Prime Time Survivor.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.880
I would be all over that game, tooth and nail, playing Prime Time Survivor.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:03.880
I hope that's the next game.

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.960
Or was it the Amazing Race?

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:06.960
Any of those games.

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.880
Although I don't know how you play the Amazing Race on Xbox.

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:10.880
I don't think that would work.

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.880
Tap A to run.

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.880
Tap A to be amazing.

01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:15.880
All right.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.880
Anyhow.

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:23.960
Well, you know, 1 versus 100 still weighs off from actually coming out.

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:28.520
But Sims 3, that's on its way out later this week.

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:32.280
And already, you know, people have been pirating the hell out of it.

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:37.440
And as with any Sims game, it's only traditional that you get an uncensored patch.

01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.760
And that's what they've done.

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.760
Boobs.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:40.760
Boobs patch.

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:44.240
Before the game has been released, they have taken away the blur.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.840
So now you can see the nipolous, you know, women without their genitalia.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.200
Well, you know they're going to make new skins, too.

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.200
Exactly.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.480
That is step 2.

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.480
And then problem.

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:55.840
Is that a new verb you just invented?

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.840
Nipolous?

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:57.840
The nip...

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.840
The most...

01:38:58.840 --> 01:38:59.840
Nipolous.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.840
The nipolous...

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.840
The most nipolous women.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:02.840
Oh, nipolous.

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:03.840
Oh, nipolous.

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.840
Very Barbie-like.

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:05.840
Oh, nipolous.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.840
I thought you were...

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:08.840
I thought you were using it as...

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:09.840
No, not as...

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.840
To describe somebody.

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840
She was quite nipply.

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.160
That actually is the word that people use, Rob.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.680
Oh, I guess that's true.

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.680
But not to...

01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:22.240
And besides, I would not be able to, you know, take credit for that phrase.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:27.800
I believe Chevy Chase said it a long time ago in Christmas Vacation.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.080
It's a bit nipply outside.

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:30.080
Alright, whatever.

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.080
Fine.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.080
That's true.

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:40.520
So, and then, besides that, The Sims 3, apparently, within the first four days of its online debut,

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:44.600
it had been downloaded 180,000 times.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:53.280
And apparently they claim that you are playing a non-final unauthorized copy of The Sims

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.280
3.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.280
Which is crap.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.280
Which...

01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.440
Yes, that is absolute crap, because I can tell you right now, retailers have had this

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.600
game for two weeks now, so...

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:09.160
It's absolute crap, and what they mean by non-final is that you haven't registered it

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.680
so you can't download the other town they have available, Riverview.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:20.520
And also you get 1,000 sim points that you can buy virtual objects with.

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.440
But you know what, it's only a matter of time before that gets leaked too, so just give

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:26.680
it time.

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.640
But I bet there's a lot of people that still want to buy the real deal.

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:33.560
Mark Sakras expressed her interest in just buying it for real.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.440
Yeah, because you're a Sims fan and you support the developers.

01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.760
I learned my lesson with buying Spore, so I will not buy The Sims 3.

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:48.120
I probably won't end up playing The Sims 3 either, but yes, Spore will not get any more

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.120
of my money.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.800
I don't know, I feel like there's so many other games for me to play right now, I don't

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.560
know if I can get sucked into The Sims 3, but I'll watch Jamie play it, and if it looks

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:56.560
interesting, I'll buy it.

01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:02.000
I only want to kill naked Sims in this game, so you know, I can't see myself actually spending

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.240
money and time to play this game, because all I'm going to do is download the uncensored

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.520
patch, download the new skins that make naked Sims, because that's funny for some reason.

01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:12.280
Naked Sim Party, Naked Sim Death Party.

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.280
I have naked Sims.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:17.760
And you know, the other costumes and skins that they have, like the naked Joker sim,

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:25.080
and you know, just ridiculous stuff, and then just kill them all in really interesting ways.

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:28.840
And that's how I'll spend an evening, and then we're done.

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.240
Then I don't play it ever again.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:33.760
That's what happens in The Sims, and then every now and then I'll go back to it, reinstall

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.520
it, and do it all over again, and then we're done.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:42.520
So I really don't see a point in me buying this full retail game for this.

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:46.280
I don't care about the other town, I don't need another town to visit to kill The Sims

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:47.480
in this way.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.480
It's just...

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.080
You don't want to kill The Sims in the other town?

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.120
I guess I could, why not, you know, but it's...

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.120
I just don't really care.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:58.560
Playing Sims right now.

01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.560
And totally enjoying it.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:04.160
Darksharkar, have you ever gone on the Naked Death Spree in The Sims?

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:06.960
No, not yet, because I told you I'm too busy building houses.

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:10.280
I was trying to make a haunted house once, and there was another time that the mailman

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.360
came and then I trapped them with a mote, and that was funny too because they couldn't

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:21.360
figure out how to leave, and then I killed the mail person by starving them to death.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.380
I would love to see a real absurd Sims-type game.

01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:28.640
Maybe this game exists somewhere, someone will have to tell me.

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:35.240
Like a very absurd Sims-type game or an add-on that is all about the horrific death of your

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.240
Sims.

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.240
Why not?

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240
They had...

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.480
I don't know if you remember this.

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:45.280
They had a freeware game that someone made called Lammers, and it was a spin-off of Lemmings,

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.480
where you had a gun and different weapons, and you shot the Lemmings as they ran across

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.720
the street, and they would do like, you know, all the stuff would be AI-driven so they would

01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.480
be doing the builders and that kind of stuff, but no, you couldn't let them get to the home

01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.160
that you had to kill them.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.640
I would play that.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640
It was awesome.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.120
I bet it's online somewhere, just look up Lammers, the freeware Lemmings spin-off.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.680
I hate Lemmings.

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:11.880
Yeah, Lemmings was awesome like ten years ago, but...

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:13.380
Lemmings reminds me of people I know.

01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:19.040
But now like Lemmings, they re-released it for the PSP and the Playstation 3, like it's

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.000
popular all over again or something, I don't know.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I can't talk.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.960
I had a fansite for drawings I would do, just because apparently the only thing I could

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.520
draw at one time was Lemmings.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:36.020
Well, maybe someday something that can be cool again is Sonic, and Sonic, of course,

01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:39.440
you know, the last few Sonic games they've put out have been, well, let's just say not

01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:41.000
as great as the old ones.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.840
Well, who remembers Sonic R?

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.160
I love Sonic R!

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.160
Oh my god!

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:49.120
You don't even understand, okay?

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.760
I'm sure it was one of your games of the week before.

01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.360
Yeah, actually, I think it has been, but I was so, the one thing I was super mad about

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:59.540
Vista is that I couldn't play Sonic R unless I play in compatibility mode, then it fucks

01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:00.720
up my resolution.

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.880
Well, the bad news is, this story is not about a Sonic R2 or a Sonic R revival, sorry.

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.480
Ugh, why'd you do that to me for?

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:12.200
But the good news is, they are talking about a new Sonic racing game.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.680
It's called Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.080
Apparently it will be Sonic versus Super Monkey Ball in his little ball.

01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:26.280
Samba De Amigo's monkey guy that has the maracas are all going to be in this Sonic racing game.

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:29.120
However, now they're in vehicles.

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:30.560
What does this game sound like to you?

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.560
No!

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.560
They have to run!

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.560
What does this game sound like to you?

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.560
They have to run!

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.360
Could they, are they going to be in carts by chance?

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.040
Rob, don't do this to me.

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.280
Maybe instead of shells they'll throw rings, I don't call it a hunch.

01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:42.760
Rob, don't do this to me!

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.800
They actually had a Game Gear game that was in carts.

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:50.400
Well, now to be fair, I am joking a little bit, this game is not going to be all carts.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:55.020
There's going to be planes and sports cars and bananas.

01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.020
That's right, bananas.

01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:00.280
Hey, this game is coming out on the Playstation 3, Xbox 360.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.640
Did you just say Sonic Butt Monkeys?

01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:03.880
No, Sonic Plus Monkeys.

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:04.880
That's what the game is.

01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.880
And the DS in 2010.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:08.680
I wonder if Ooh La La will be in it.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.960
I swear you said Sonic Butt Monkeys.

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:12.920
Instant purchase of Ooh La La's in it.

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:18.800
Well, remember, she was in Sega Superstar Tennis, I believe, so it very well...

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:23.840
I fucking hate that Sega keeps teasing Ooh La La in front of us, though, like, remember

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.440
Space Channel 5?

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.520
Too bad you're never going to see another one!

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:32.840
I wonder if we're going to have Ooh La La's in it if Space Michael will be in it.

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:33.920
Nope.

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.920
Don't hold your breath.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:39.880
I like Space Michael, it's the only cool incarnation he's had since, you know, Thriller, when he

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.120
was a zombie.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.120
Leo Shen agrees with me.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.520
I will only buy this game if Ooh La La is a guest again.

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.520
She was in Riders.

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.800
There you go.

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.640
So we'll see more about this game.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:51.640
Who knows?

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.640
Maybe something at E3?

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:53.640
Question mark?

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.640
We will see.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.520
Apparently this game is out in 2010, so they got to show it at some point.

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.240
Let's move on to some more gaming news in the meantime.

01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:03.080
This is happy, happy, happy news, and I wonder if my hubby knows about it, which he probably

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:04.600
does.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:09.840
Sega is going to be doing downloadable vintage games on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:17.120
Starting off with the, one of the pinnacle of video games, Gunstar Heroes, on June 10th,

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:25.200
and of course the next day it will be out on PlayStation Network, is actually, that's

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.040
the only one that's supposed to be coming out on PlayStation Network so far, but there

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:35.600
were seven other titles announced for Xbox Live Arcade, which I think that I've already

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:42.640
covered this, Arcade Shinobi, Comic Zone, Altered Beast, Sonic 3, Phantasy Star 2, Sonic

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.880
& Knuckles, and Gunstar Heroes.

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.480
Great except for the fact that I already own that Sega collection.

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:55.800
Do you know how many copies of Gunstar Heroes we have and Gunstar Super Heroes and all versions

01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.800
of Gunstar Heroes?

01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:00.400
And let me guess, this will be one more because you need the achievements, right?

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:01.400
It's Dan.

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:02.400
He'll get it.

01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.400
He'll get it.

01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:04.400
I know he'll get it.

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.680
Um, Loki found that clip of Lamer's on YouTube that we were talking about earlier.

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:11.360
I think I've played that game before.

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:12.760
I think I've played it before.

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:15.760
It looked very familiar to me, but yeah, can you link that in chat?

01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.220
I know this does no good for our podcast listeners, but can you at least link it in chat so they

01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:20.840
can kind of see what you're looking at here?

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:22.600
I just saw the best mashup game, Rob.

01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:23.600
What's that?

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.560
Mashup game of the week, Worms and Lemmings.

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.200
Wait, is this a real game or something you want to exist?

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.740
I'm gonna start my mashup game of the week.

01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:34.740
That's a lot.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.740
Mashup game.

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:36.740
All right.

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:37.800
It is Worms and Lemmings.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:40.680
Imagine your Lemmings are running around and you blow them up with the...

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.680
That's what this is.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:42.680
Look at this.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:43.680
Well, no.

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:49.440
You actually, they wage war on each other and your Lemmings are your innocent bystanders.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:51.080
I remember an old-ass PC game.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.920
I'm going on a tangent here, but I don't care.

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.840
I remember an old-ass PC game.

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.920
I think it was called Global Thermonuclear War.

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920
Yeah!

01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920
Did you ever play that game?

01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.920
A long time ago.

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.080
And it was all about nuking other countries.

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.040
And they had very- Would you like to play a game?

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:08.480
Very caricatured world leaders in this.

01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.480
And it was just about nuking other countries.

01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.600
Was it a game that came from War Games?

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.080
The movie War Games?

01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:17.080
It might have.

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.880
The thing was, let's play Global Thermonuclear War.

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.480
Yeah, maybe it was that, but it came out much later than the movie was out.

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.420
I remember it was on VGA and all that.

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:30.540
They have this game available for download in the DOS museum at LinkedIn chat.

01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:31.540
Very nice.

01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:33.960
So, you can check that out, dosmuseum.com.

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:36.840
Just look for lammers.

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:39.000
And yes, you just gun down people.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.360
That's all you do.

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.840
Somewhere right now in the world, a phone call is being made from an angry parental

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.840
association.

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:50.480
Some folks in chat remember the game, too.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.480
Reddertainment says they're in chat.

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.480
Chat.orangetonsradio.com.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:54.480
I remember playing this game.

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:57.320
See, that's what- When I saw the YouTube, then I was like, oh yeah, I have played this

01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:58.320
before.

01:48:58.320 --> 01:48:59.320
Anyhow, more news.

01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.320
Sorry, Logie.

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:06.520
So, there's a possibility, according to Volition, that they may port Saints Row or Red Faction

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.280
to the Wii.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.160
And that's pretty awesome.

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.480
I guess during the Red Faction Gorilla launch event in New York, someone apparently asked

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.560
them about that.

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:24.840
And they said, though THQ may do Wii versions of our games, in the future Volition won't

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:25.840
be doing them.

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:27.800
At least not for the next year or so.

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:32.720
So they may have another party or another company port them over.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:33.720
I don't know.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.440
I think Saints Row on the Wii is pretty awesome.

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:37.440
Why is that?

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:40.800
Even though graphically it would probably have to be scaled down, but what is it?

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.040
With the motion control and everything?

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.040
Or what is it about?

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.040
Yeah, it'd just be murdering things.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.840
I mean, they actually- Yeah, but wasn't that what Manhunt 2 was supposed to be, and look

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:48.840
how that turned out.

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:52.720
Yeah, but there's other games that are like that that are fun, like Scarface.

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.960
Scarface was pretty fun, and it was kind of the same type of game.

01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.560
Just Saints Row is really over the top.

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:04.240
But yeah, I would see a Saints Row 3.

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:06.360
Saints Row is kind of one of those overlooked type of games.

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.360
How did the second one sell?

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:08.360
Do you know?

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:09.360
Not very well.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:10.360
Ugh.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.360
Yeah, it's too bad.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.760
I'm actually planning on picking up the other expansion pack.

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.680
I still haven't played the last expansion pack that they had come out.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:21.640
I've been too busy with other things, but I do want to go back to it, because it's pretty

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:22.640
fun.

01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:25.640
I also have Left 4 Dead I haven't played yet, and Fallout 3.

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.560
All these games that are just sitting waiting.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:30.360
Oh, and Killzone 2 and Resistance 2.

01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.280
It's too much.

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:37.440
All right, well, moving on with some more gaming news.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.800
Another series that seems to be making a comeback, Trauma Team.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.720
This is coming out from Atlus, is putting this out on the Wii.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.660
And yes, this does appear to be in the same vein as Trauma Center and all that.

01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:51.480
This is now Trauma Team is the game that's going to be coming out on the Wii.

01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:56.200
It's going to be gameplay six different medical fields, so you're not just necessarily a doctor

01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.200
now.

01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.960
You're going to be a general surgeon, diagnostician, orthopedic surgeon, endoscope technician.

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.180
Oh, great.

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:05.960
You can do colonoscopies in a video game now.

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:07.360
Now I've heard everything.

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.720
Medical examiner and EMT.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:10.720
Very interesting.

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:13.560
Dude that mops up hospital rooms.

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:17.320
I just, I am shocked, because you know what an endoscopy is.

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.320
Yes, I do know it.

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.200
That's where they put a tube in your body somewhere.

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.640
So like, either you're going to be doing examinations down the mouth and throat, which I guess is

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:28.520
probably likely, or up a butt.

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.260
This could be very interesting gaming.

01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:37.000
Is Trauma Team about me when I play it, and not the victims in the game?

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.400
It'd be even better if you could do it.

01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.840
Will it be Katie Couric showing it live on TV?

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:45.800
Do you have multiple, now do they have two player in the last game?

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:47.160
I think they did, yes.

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.040
Because they should have two player in this, except you would never want to play with me,

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.160
because I'd be like, let's play tic-tac-toe on his colon, you know?

01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:59.960
But it looks like, look at this, you're like pounding on a guy's chest in this screenshot

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:01.120
here, like you're doing all these-

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.120
God damn it, live!

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:05.120
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor.

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:11.040
That would be awesome if they had like some sort of vocal recognition software or something

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.040
in there.

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:15.400
It's like karaoke revolution, so you gotta yell like, you know, a phrase or something.

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:19.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look at this picture here, I gotta link this in chat, look at this.

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:23.800
Some person lifting up their shirt, exposing their bra while the doctor's operating on

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:24.800
them.

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.520
This is like little kids playing doctor, realized it's a video game.

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:29.920
It's not a mastectomy.

01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:30.920
Wow.

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:35.480
Wow, we're looking at Grey's Anatomy the game now.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:36.480
Apparently.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.480
My gosh.

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.360
Grey's Anatomy the game sucks.

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:45.480
Tiger Claw in chat says, the tagline for the game would be, explore Uranus.

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:52.160
Okay, that was probably one of the single most beautiful things I've ever heard from

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:54.200
a listener, ever.

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:59.120
Boldly go, where no man has gone before.

01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:03.840
You know what, at E3, I'm gonna make it a point to find this game, and when they tell

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:07.760
me that you can be an endoscopy technician, I'm gonna say it's so like you can do a colonoscopy

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.760
in the game.

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.760
Do it.

01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:10.760
Oh my god, do it.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:11.760
I will do it.

01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:12.760
I promise you.

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:13.760
You have to do it.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.760
I promise the listeners.

01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:19.640
I will ask if we get colonoscopies, and when they tell me no, I'm gonna ask why not.

01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:23.280
Do we have an option of leaving a sponge behind?

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:25.760
Ah, crap.

01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:32.400
Like you should have to count the sponges and stuff, make sure that they're all there,

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:36.160
and then you don't, and then later on, you know, it flashes to a cut scene where the

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:40.320
guy's like feeling, you know, like chest pains and stuff like that.

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.720
I can see the scenario now, alright.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:43.720
Scenario one.

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.720
Okay, here it is.

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:49.840
You've got the diagnostician is playing with the endoscopy, like your team here, so okay,

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:54.980
this patient has come in and is complaining of pains, and he's feeling some little tapping

01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:05.280
pains in his rear end, and him and his partner were playing with gerbils a little while ago.

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:07.200
You gotta diagnose and treat.

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:11.200
So I've got gerbils up his butt.

01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:12.200
Let's operate.

01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.500
Do we get to hear the Lemmy Winks song at that time?

01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.040
This could be the most beautiful video game of all time.

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.680
This has so much potential.

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:21.100
So much potential.

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:26.880
And then when they die on the operating table, then we have the spinoff, you know, the Phoenix

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:30.200
Rite or the Ace Attorney series, you know.

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.200
The legend is not good.

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.200
Medical malpractice.

01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:35.400
Ace Attorney.

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:36.520
The legend is not good.

01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.900
We are so mature tonight.

01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:42.240
The legend is not good in chat says, I seriously want to leave a junior mint on the patient

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.200
before I stitch him up.

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200
What?

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.720
So your fart starts smelling minty?

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.200
No, didn't you see that?

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:49.200
No, what?

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:50.200
No.

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.200
It's from Seinfeld.

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.200
It's they, they had a junior mint.

01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:57.960
They're watching a operation and they drop a junior mint and it gets, it gets into his

01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:58.960
body.

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:02.920
It makes him really sick, I guess.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.920
What would happen if you, if you really left a junior mint in someone's body?

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:06.920
It would suck.

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.440
You would not be happy.

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:09.440
That's all.

01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.440
You would not be happy.

01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.240
All right.

01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:19.280
This is getting way too, uh, Frisbee is mentioning the sequel Morg Center.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:25.560
Death is upon us, dude, God, I love our chatters.

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.240
The most fantastic name ever.

01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:28.880
I love our chatters so much.

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:29.880
All right.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.320
Look, uh, we love the listeners so much.

01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.960
Let's do a segment dedicated to them.

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.640
It's, yes, it's why they hate.

01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:41.320
You've just lavished praise upon our listeners for their genius comments tonight, dark Sakura.

01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:44.840
And now I, you know what segment I'm getting to and you're complaining, I'm sorry to take

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:49.760
you away from house building, but it is that time where we open up the mailbag and read

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:55.320
your emails at mailbag at orange launch reader.com and see what you guys have to say.

01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:57.840
By the way, Marissa Congusto, you could die.

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.360
You would get a terrible infection.

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.080
That's what would happen with the junior men to see, you know, see chat room can answer

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.440
the questions that we can sometimes.

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:06.440
All right.

01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.280
Dark Sakura, open up the old email bag at mailbag at orange launch reader.com.

01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:13.680
You're gonna have to put your house building away and uh, all right.

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:15.720
And uh, look at this, Rob.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:16.720
Look at this.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:17.720
Oh, she's ready to go.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.720
All right.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:19.720
Okay.

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:20.720
Email number one.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.720
Dear OLR.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:27.840
Dear Rob, I think you should stop giving Jamie a hard time and go eat a junior man.

01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:33.160
Love, uh, member dark Sakura.

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:34.160
One.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.160
Okay.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:38.560
First one is cheeseburger.

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:44.440
Hey guys, last week I was listening live on my PSP, so cool and was not in the chat room.

01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:48.120
The thing I wanted to chime in was the discussion of arcade cabinets.

01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:51.040
I don't remember who said they would kill for an original star Wars arcade machine,

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:54.320
but I would so kill for an original star Wars arcade machine.

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:59.520
I'm 15, so obviously didn't grow up in the eighties, but I have always thought, and everyone

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:02.320
tells me that I was born in the wrong decade.

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.800
I would give anything to have grown up in the eighties.

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:05.800
No Reagan.

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:06.800
That's all.

01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.920
Um, I roam eBay for countless hours for classic video games.

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:16.700
I watch all of the AVGN videos and well, the angry video game nerd to translate.

01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:20.240
And while this email is getting too long, my longest OLR email so far, I'm going to

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.240
shut up.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.240
PS sky.

01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.560
I mess around with iPod custom firmware and would like to make an OLR custom firmware

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:27.560
for iPod.

01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:32.640
So could you send me or link me to some OLR picks to work with?

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:35.100
I will totally forget that request.

01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:39.360
So send me a message to my personal email at rob at orange and Andre.com and I will

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:40.920
be happy to do that.

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.920
Okay.

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:47.880
Also, I do want to commend our different cheeseburger for vastly improving and spelling and grammar.

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:54.560
So the most improved award you, you win a shiny, shiny gold star you seriously.

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:55.560
You win.

01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:57.840
It's probably one of the most legible emails I've received from cheeseburger.

01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:58.840
Here you go.

01:57:58.840 --> 01:57:59.960
Have a junior mint.

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:03.600
You get a golden junior mint, which you don't want to know why it's cold.

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:06.080
Next email.

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:07.080
This is from alpha.

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:08.840
Can anagram it's your OLR.

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:09.840
This is a quick lesson.

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:10.840
The email.

01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:11.840
Well, it's a lot longer than I thought it would be.

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:16.520
Actually a plan on getting a PSP go, but I'm keeping my PSP 2000, which has the earliest

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:19.560
motherboard and firmware version 3.90.

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:24.640
The one I had to fix and asked y'all's advice, god I miss people saying that, advice on removing

01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:29.240
that damned stripped screw, which I finally got out.

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:34.040
I preordered a game that comes out in a month that is on UMD, I'm importing slash paying

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:39.040
for this one since it comes with a physical preorder bonus that you can't pirate.

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.820
But I have just realized that I haven't bought any recent PSP games that require a firmware

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:47.840
update, since my PSP's d-pad was previously broken for the longest time until recently.

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:51.460
And this game probably will have a firmware update on it that will want to be installed

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:52.760
before the game can be played.

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:58.840
The thing is, with multiple commas, is that I still want to hack this PSP and play the

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:03.080
game without updating, but I have no Pandora battery or magic memory stick.

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:08.360
Do y'all know anyone or any place that is reputable and cheap or free to get either

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.360
of these items from?

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:14.360
I probably can make the memory stick thing, not sure about the battery part.

01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:20.600
You can make the battery, but you need to have another PSP to do that.

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.600
Another PSP.

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:22.600
So borrow a friend's?

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.280
Another PSP with a custom firmware, and then there's a program that you can run to make

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:26.480
the battery.

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:30.120
And then to make a battery for a 2000 is a pain in the ass.

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:32.600
Because you have to do some extra steps.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:35.280
But it's not that hard, I did it, I still have one.

01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:39.280
Oh, I still have one.

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:44.040
Also, if we're ready then for the conclusion of the email that's answered the question.

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:47.080
This email has been brought to you by Yoshi's Island, home of the never-ending Crying Baby

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:48.080
Marios.

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:49.080
Waaa!

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:50.800
God, I hated Toys R Us when that thing was there.

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:51.800
Oh man.

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:52.800
I used to play that demo.

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:54.000
Did you use to work at Toys R Us?

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:59.040
No, I just used to frequent Toys R Us when they had toys in there, now that it's Baby

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:02.160
RS slash Toys R Us.

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:05.680
I have to say though, touch fuzzy, get dizzy, one of the greatest stages in all of video

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:06.680
gaming.

02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:11.440
Yes, I didn't notice the USB port or spot-to-access battery on the PSP Go pictures, comma comma

02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:12.440
comma.

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:13.440
Hmm.

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:16.720
Well, then again, E3 hasn't happened yet, so I suppose it is a secret to everybody.

02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:21.400
PPS, I am probably going to grammar hell, ain't I?

02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:25.400
P-P-P-S, To Dark Sakura, comma comma comma heart.

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:28.840
I know you did that on purpose.

02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:29.840
K.

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:30.840
Whatever.

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:31.840
Next email.

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.640
Dun dun dun.

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:34.920
I think this is from Act Deaf.

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:35.920
Yeah, it is.

02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:39.400
Hi, OLR crew, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Act Deaf.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:43.520
I'm writing today to ask a couple of questions and to fill some space up in the old mailbag.

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:44.920
I hope you can answer them.

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:49.400
I'm probably getting a PSP soon, and yeah, I know the PSP Go is coming and all that stuff,

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:51.000
but I personally think the design sucks.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Amen!

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.200
Oh my god, it looks like a cell phone.

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:58.640
Of course, one of my immediate purchases is Rock Band Unplugged, and I already have pretty

02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:01.600
Can I Be the Hero and Pump It Up Portable.

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:06.040
My question is what other games should I look out for, especially cheap ones since my budget

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.600
isn't that big right now.

02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:10.960
Any type of game except SRPGs are good.

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.720
Potapon 2 and Loco Roko, two, both 20 bucks.

02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:14.720
Loco Roko.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:17.980
Luminous is one of the greatest puzzle games you'll ever play, and the PSP is the platform

02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:20.760
to play it on, especially if you can find Luminous 2.

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:25.320
The sequel was really effing good and unfortunately didn't quite have that same magic and momentum

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:29.640
of its first game, although the first game does have Shining and some really good tracks.

02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:33.080
Luminous 2, don't overlook it, it's a great little puzzler game.

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.200
If you can find it on the cheap, definitely pick that up.

02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.640
And the Grand Theft Auto games are pretty good too.

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:44.080
Also since you're going to be at E3, I would like to ask you to look for any info on a

02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:46.920
possible American release of Space Invaders Extreme 2.

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:50.880
I love the first game and have the Xbox Live Arcade version, I would love to have a localized

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:53.560
version of it instead of importing it.

02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:57.680
I also want to follow up on a call of mine from a few weeks back in the Latin America

02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:01.360
release of Patapon 2, since it's download only in the States.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:05.160
I searched in some stores here in Mexico a few days ago and found they were selling Patapon

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:10.240
2, and surprisingly it was on UMD, no download copies here apparently.

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.320
Thank god Sony did the right thing here and released it on physical media, it would have

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:18.800
been a pain in the ass just to download the thing from the PSN store, though of course

02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:22.040
the game costs double the price in the US.

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.680
Well those are my questions for now, I wish you a good trip to E3 Skyloki and I hope you

02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.200
have a great time there, PS bring us some E3 swag.

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:31.760
We just might.

02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:39.080
Um, okay, I guess this is Dan Shadow, what's your favorite kind of flour, mine's chocolate.

02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:40.080
What?!

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:41.080
Whatever.

02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.200
Uh, I like tuna.

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:44.760
Mine's tuna.

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:47.960
Type of, wait what, flour?

02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:48.960
Flour?

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:49.960
Flour?

02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:51.120
The game on Playstation 3.

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:53.120
I don't know.

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.120
Baking.

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:56.720
That's F-L-O-W-E-R.

02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:58.600
You didn't say that.

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.340
I said flower, not flower.

02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:02.760
You know what, go stuff a junior mint.

02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:04.600
Where the sun don't shine.

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:05.600
How about the last email?

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:06.600
A virgin's.

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.600
Hello?

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:13.600
I see what you did there, okay.

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.240
You made a dumb email pretty good, Loki, good job.

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.240
Okay.

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:22.080
Hello NOLA Orange Lounge Radio Crew, this is Blue Swim from the NOLA Army's Twitter

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:23.080
Division.

02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:28.360
Over the Memorial Day weekend last week, my beloved cat of 13 years, Goldie, took ill.

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:31.920
After her condition worsened, I had to do the toughest thing I've ever done and had

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:32.920
her put to sleep.

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:33.920
Aww.

02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:35.920
Her passing was the first time I've cried since I was a kid.

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:37.280
What a downer.

02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.720
Why did you have to end with this one?

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.720
This is sad.

02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:41.060
I'm so sorry to hear about that.

02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:42.400
It's never easy to lose a pet.

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.400
It's like losing a baby.

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:45.000
My kitty died.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.600
It's sad, now I'm going to be in a bad mood the rest of the night.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.960
Oh, let me finish reading the email.

02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.960
Fine.

02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:50.960
Stop being a baby.

02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:54.280
It wasn't uncommon for her to walk over and plop herself down on my lap while I was in

02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:55.920
the middle of playing a game.

02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.600
She'd do it even while I was playing the drums and rock band.

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.640
It's actually one of my favorite gaming memories, which leads to my question for this email.

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:02.640
This is so sad.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:08.100
Do you guys have any gaming related memories involving a pet or pets that you've had?

02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:12.400
Thank you for doing OLR all this time, keep doing what you're doing, Blue Swim.

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:16.760
My old cat, Madeline, really the only cat I had because I haven't had one in many years.

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.480
She passed away several years ago.

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:21.000
She was actually named after the actress, Madeline Kahn.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
That's fantastic.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Yeah, who else?

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.600
Well, because Clue was my favorite movie growing up, so when we got my cat, I named my cat

02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:31.120
after Madeline Kahn because, of course, Mrs. White was one of the best characters in that

02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.120
movie.

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:35.480
Anyhow, my cat would actually, while I was playing video games, my cat liked to hang

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:36.480
out.

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.340
Shermie's not on her box, I can tell you that.

02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:42.800
My cat liked to hang out in this patio room that we had.

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:46.660
We had an indoor patio and that was basically the cat's room.

02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:49.800
My mom didn't like the cat in the house because it would get fur everywhere, but the cat basically

02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.800
had her own room.

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:53.680
But we had a glass door leading to this indoor patio.

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.900
So when I would play video games, I remember my cat would run up and just kind of stare

02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.840
through the door at the TV.

02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:02.640
But we all know cats don't really see the same images we do.

02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:03.640
Something about the TV.

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:04.640
I don't know.

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:07.520
But when I was a young kid, I used to think, oh, she loves watching me play video games.

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:11.240
So I remember that with my cat.

02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:15.640
Do you have a pet-related story, Logie?

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:20.560
My cat Chase is the Wii pointer on the screen.

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:24.880
When Animal Crossing would come, when we'd play Animal Crossing, and the little bus logo

02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:28.600
thing would pop up on the screen, she'd get down the bottom of the TV and start pawing

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:30.560
at it.

02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:37.280
When I got DDR Second Mix, this was actually not too long after I first got Shermie, so

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:40.280
she was probably about two years old at the time.

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:47.040
She used to hit the analog button on the Dreamcast pads and start the game for me or put me in

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.040
another.

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:49.040
You know, put me in SSR.

02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:52.480
I'd be like, damn it, I'm not that good yet.

02:05:52.480 --> 02:06:00.920
And then she would actually every so often she'd enjoy watching the fish on the Sega

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.320
bass fishing.

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:08.080
And then but now she just sits down and watches us play because she's really fat and lazy.

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:12.920
Marissa in chat says, that has inspired me to name a cat if I ever get one, Gilda.

02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:14.440
What an amazing name for a cat.

02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:15.440
What an amazing woman.

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:16.440
Gilda, by the way.

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:17.440
My sims have a cat named Sylvia.

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:18.440
Sorry.

02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:20.680
I'm going to get all weepy if we keep talking about these, like, cats.

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:22.880
Let me see if I've got another email.

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.800
Don't we have a dick and fart joke?

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:25.880
Can't we tell more junior men jokes?

02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:26.880
Something?

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:27.880
Oh, shoot.

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:28.880
I forgot to read the very last part of that email.

02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:29.880
Oh, okay.

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:33.000
In case you were curious, the title of this email, and lost a friend, is a reference to

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.900
the Exploder Evacuator Part 2 radio commercial from GTA Vice City.

02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:38.840
Now you know annoying is half the battle.

02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:40.240
Peace, Smiley.

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:44.200
Well, best of luck with and I'm really sorry to hear about your loss.

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:47.960
And if your family decides to get another cat, there are many, many cats out there who

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:48.960
need love.

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:49.960
Adopt a cat.

02:06:49.960 --> 02:06:52.640
Everyone go out there and adopt a cat.

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:54.280
Well, some people are allergic.

02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.280
Some people don't.

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.280
So I'm allergic.

02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:59.800
I have air filters in my house and I take sinus medicine every day.

02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:01.400
I love my cat.

02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:04.220
I will do whatever I can to keep my cat.

02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:09.160
So if I can't, the only thing I won't get a dog because I'm actually so allergic to

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:11.000
dogs that allergy medicine does not touch it.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.880
I actually, I don't know if I've ever gotten into this on the show and maybe I shouldn't,

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.640
but I actually have a fear of dogs.

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.640
It's taken me a little.

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:17.640
Do you?

02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:19.800
Yes, I have a, I have a definite case of fear of dogs.

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:20.800
It doesn't matter the size.

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:22.440
I get really nervous around dogs.

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:26.860
I've gotten a lot better with it in the past five years than I would say from the time

02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:29.720
I was five through about the time I was like 21.

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:30.720
It was really bad.

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.920
Like whenever I get around dogs, I get really nervous, like I can't like be around dogs.

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:41.160
And this goes back to, I was bit by one when I was five and it was very, um, traumatic.

02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:43.160
So be careful with that book.

02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:45.160
It's older than me.

02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.160
Oh yeah.

02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:47.160
Okay.

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:48.160
Um, you know what though?

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.160
You should meet pocket.

02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:50.720
I think actually you'd scream like a little girl about pocket.

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:51.720
See, here's the thing.

02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:55.000
And I don't want to disappoint you, but everybody tells me I would feel different about their

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:59.780
dog and I won't like, I'm just, no, I think you'd scream like a little girl around pocket.

02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:00.780
What is this big?

02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:05.600
Oh, then, Oh, well that would scream in terror and you would, you want to put me in my own

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:06.600
personal hell.

02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:07.600
Sure.

02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:08.600
I'll do that.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:11.720
And has the loudest bark ever.

02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:13.360
That's not even, I don't have a dog.

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:16.080
I won't have a dog and I don't let them in my house.

02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:18.040
Um, so you don't have to worry about it for me.

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:24.480
The only kind of dog I want is a, is a, uh, corgi, uh, I N G N zero and I'm sorry, I'm

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:25.480
sorry.

02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:26.480
I'm not pronouncing your name right.

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:27.480
Probably says a Rob.

02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:29.040
You fear guns, projectiles and dogs.

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:30.040
Yeah.

02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:31.040
That about covers it.

02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:34.560
You know, I wonder if you would be okay with the Basenji.

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:36.480
They're not really like a modern dog.

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:37.480
I will say this.

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:41.800
There has been one dog that I was able to get along with and it was my, um, grandma's

02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:44.160
old dash on wiener dog.

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:47.920
Um, because yeah, it was missing an eye.

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:55.040
So it was a handicapped dog and very, very quiet, very slow moving, very, you know, like

02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:58.760
very just, I needed, I need an old lazy dog.

02:08:58.760 --> 02:08:59.760
If anything.

02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:00.760
Well, I don't need a dog.

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:01.760
I will always be a cat person.

02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:04.720
If you were to have a dog, which won't happen, if you worked, if someone told us to bring

02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:09.000
a dog in your house, in an alternate universe, it would have to be an old lazy fat dog.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Yes.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Something like that.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Blind in one eye.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Yes.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Answer's still lucky.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.360
So no offense to you dog owners out there, but just understand this, this goes back to

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.640
a childhood fear that I can't shake.

02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:20.420
You have a fish called kitty.

02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:21.420
A fish called puppy.

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:22.420
That's my roommates.

02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:23.420
Not mine.

02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:24.420
Oh, you should get a cat.

02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:26.000
Uh, roommate doesn't want one.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
And I, I understand.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:31.280
Um, maybe, maybe later on, maybe later on, but I definitely am getting a cat at some

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:32.280
point.

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:36.240
But you know, when, when, uh, when there's somebody else to take care of, if you get

02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:40.600
a boy cat name and Frank, I haven't thought of, I haven't even thought of names yet.

02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:41.600
I get a boy cat.

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:43.000
His name is going to be Frank.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:48.440
After Frank inverter, cheeseburger in our chat room says, Rob hell is a great Dane with

02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:53.040
Mayo and guns pretty much pretty much that about sums it up.

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.040
All right.

02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.040
Look, some more news.

02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:56.040
Cause we want to take your calls.

02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:57.040
All night long.

02:09:57.040 --> 02:09:58.040
Geez, Louise.

02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:59.040
Yeah.

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:00.040
You people gotta get out of my house.

02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.040
All right.

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.040
Loki, please.

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:07.260
Um, well, I don't know if anyone remembers, uh, the old toy mad balls, but apparently

02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:13.740
mad balls are coming back, um, with an Xbox live arcade game, uh, called mad balls in

02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.360
Babbo invasion.

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:22.360
And it's going to be a, um, action game where you can, uh, basically like a shoot them up

02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:29.000
action game and it's going to have, um, four player co-op, 16 player multiplayer and randomly

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:30.840
generated maps.

02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:34.620
And I have their PR guy keeps hounding me.

02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:37.260
So we have actually a meeting with them at E3.

02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:43.800
It's my first meeting, so, uh, we'll find out more about it, but you know, when I first

02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:46.280
saw this, I'm like mad balls, really?

02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.880
Is that like a smart IP to try to bring back?

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:54.920
I mean, really, but reading the comments on like some of these news stories, everybody's

02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:57.240
like really enthusiastic about it.

02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:58.240
I'm like, okay.

02:10:58.240 --> 02:10:59.240
Might be.

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.720
You know who won't be playing that?

02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:03.920
Me.

02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:07.400
I will wait for Loki's report before I make a decision either way.

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:10.160
Oh, I was going to drag you along.

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.160
Oh, goodie.

02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:12.160
When is this?

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:13.160
Wednesday?

02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.160
Noon.

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:15.160
Yeah.

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:16.160
Oh, fine.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:17.160
I'll go.

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:18.160
We'll see.

02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:22.280
I don't have a lot of meetings planned, but I, you know, I find, especially with the smaller

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:25.080
companies, if you walk up and care, they will talk your ear off.

02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:26.480
So I'm, I'm all for it.

02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:27.480
Why not?

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:30.560
Well, I don't want to spend an hour looking at this one game.

02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:32.840
Well, yeah, I mean, well, it depends.

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:33.840
It depends.

02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.400
I'm going to open mind, open mind.

02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:37.960
They gave me a 15 inch spiel and that's it.

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.000
Well, they don't have a booth, so they don't really have anything to demonstrate.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.640
I mean, we'll see.

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:44.640
We'll see.

02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:45.640
All right.

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:46.640
More to come.

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:47.640
Of course.

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:49.480
We're not doing a show next week, are we?

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:50.480
Because of E3.

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:51.480
I'll be back.

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:52.960
Are you going to be back?

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.280
I'll be back, but we'll see.

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:56.600
We may or may not be here next week.

02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:58.080
I know it's Bobby's 200th show.

02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.640
He may want to go along or he might be tired too.

02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:05.080
More to come on that if we will be here next week or not, but we'll definitely do something

02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:06.080
to cover E3.

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:09.640
Anyhow, I want to move on though with some of the news that came out this weekend.

02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:11.640
The next story has to do with Grand Theft Auto.

02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:15.880
This was some news that kind of got trumped a little bit by everything else, all the leaks

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:16.880
coming out of E3.

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.880
This is certainly huge news.

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:20.040
That also proves that that last, what was it?

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.040
That Twitter.

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:25.720
Remember that Twitter reveal that it was supposed to have the full E3 lineup for Microsoft.

02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:27.720
Yeah, it was a bunch of bullshit.

02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:28.720
Oh, why?

02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:29.720
Because they had the wrong title.

02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:30.720
Oh, they had the wrong title.

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:33.000
Well, who would have thought that this would be the title?

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.280
I mean, I don't think anyone could have guessed that the official title of the next expansion

02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:39.140
is The Ballad of Gay Tony.

02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:43.360
And apparently in this, you will be taking on Luis Lopez, who is a part-time hoodlum

02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:48.160
and full-time assistant to nightclub impresario Tony Prince, who is Gay Tony.

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.160
Now, I don't know enough about the story.

02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:51.840
Loki, please explain.

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:54.560
Who is Gay Tony and is he just happy or is he gay?

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.560
No, he's gay.

02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:57.400
He's a nightclub owner.

02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:03.120
Basically, really all the expansions tie in with is there's a mission that's called the

02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:04.880
Impossible Trinity.

02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:10.980
And basically, it's a diamond deal that goes down bad.

02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:22.280
Both Nico and Johnny are there doing an exchange with the Triads for selling them diamonds.

02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:28.140
And Luis comes in and basically robs them of their diamonds and breaks up the whole

02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:32.640
thing and there's a big gun battle in the Museum of Natural History.

02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:34.360
So that all goes down.

02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:36.080
I'm not really sure what they're going to cover with this.

02:13:36.080 --> 02:13:39.760
There's a lot of speculation saying because the last expansion, they updated the rock

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.280
and rap stations and stuff.

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:45.840
This is going to be more of the electronica updates as far as music goes and stuff.

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:50.780
And it's supposed to focus around Al Gonquin, his nightclub and stuff like that.

02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:53.080
Maybe like the safe house and stuff.

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:56.640
Now, before you might think my feathers are ruffled being the gay guy on the show that

02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:00.080
they're naming this, the ballad of Gay Tony or whatever, I actually kind of don't care

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:03.040
because Rockstar has a track record of handling these issues pretty good.

02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:07.960
I mean, we remember Bully, you know, actually kind of handled it fairly interesting.

02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:11.480
And you know, I don't see any, you know, if it's a gay character in a story, who cares?

02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:16.920
I think you run into Gay Tony in the first game, well, like the main storyline.

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:20.200
So you know, it's all about and how they handle it.

02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:21.200
Yeah.

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:24.100
Now, but let me tell you what pisses, well, is there anything else you want to mention

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.160
about this though?

02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:28.960
Because I'm going to segue into the FUs of the week here because there is one thing about

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.800
this that kind of pisses me off.

02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.240
And it's the whole fact that you can call this game the Ballad of Gay Tony, but heaven

02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:38.480
forbid you can't put gay in your profile.

02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:41.940
Remember that whole thing that came up a couple of weeks ago where Microsoft says you can't,

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:45.800
you know, talk about the sexuality stuff in your profile, but yet it's okay to name the

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:48.280
game the Ballad of Gay Tony.

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:50.940
So I see a double standard here.

02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:53.420
And when I see double standards, I get very irritated.

02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:56.320
Not that I want to put gay in my profile, but if somebody does, why shouldn't they be

02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:57.580
allowed to?

02:14:57.580 --> 02:15:02.080
You know, if somebody wants to put, hi, I'm gay or whatever, then that's their prerogative.

02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:05.240
If somebody puts, I hate gays, well, that's a lot different.

02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:06.240
See what I'm saying?

02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:07.240
Yeah.

02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:08.400
But anyhow, there's a clear double standard here.

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.400
Double standards piss me off.

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:15.400
It's time for the FUs of the week.

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:36.920
Um, believe it or not, I don't have, I don't, I'm in a pretty darn good mood right now.

02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:42.160
So actually, God, we're in like bizarro world tonight.

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:46.280
You know what, can you do some dark soccer?

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:47.280
Sorry to hear it.

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:48.280
Sorry I'm not laughing.

02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:53.280
It's just funny out of everything that comes out of it, you got that.

02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:55.280
Sorry to hear it.

02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:02.400
FU to housework and because my knees hurt because I've been crawling around on laminate

02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:05.560
flooring and they're all bruised, so that sucks.

02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:09.560
And I still have lots of paintings to do and I have a lot of other stuff I have to do when

02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:13.160
I'm moving in in two weeks, so yikes.

02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:18.160
So FU to work, oh, and I've been getting up at eight in the morning working till like six

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:19.160
at night today.

02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:26.240
I flipped off a day of work after the morning later worked at the house, so yeah, long days.

02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:27.920
But how is it being in your own house now?

02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:33.120
Um, it'll be cool when it's done and just, uh, we have like the baseboards to do and painting

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:34.120
and stuff.

02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:36.120
Luckily my parents are helping out the kitchen and stuff.

02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:40.120
My dad's been really cool when it comes down to actually, you know, help me during the

02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:44.120
days to stop for me to come in, you know, during the times I'm gone, yeah, I use the

02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:47.120
green stuff to come in and do all the baseboards.

02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:51.120
Some of my mom's gonna be painting while I'm gone and stuff, so you know, couldn't have

02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.120
done it without them, so it's really cool.

02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:55.120
But yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty awesome.

02:16:55.120 --> 02:17:02.120
I, I keep, I'm tempted because my wife promised when we get a house I could get an arcade

02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:03.120
cabinet.

02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:04.120
Of course she said that all the time.

02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:05.120
She just sold ours.

02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:06.120
So, maybe.

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:11.120
But I'm not building it this time.

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:14.120
It'll be pre, pre-cut, prefab.

02:17:14.120 --> 02:17:21.620
All right, um, and I will, uh, go ahead and, uh, say, um, my F.U. of the week goes to spammers.

02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:26.120
Oh my god, I've been getting more spam on Gmail lately, like I don't know what happened,

02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:29.420
but over the weekend the spammers figured out how to get through or something, and I've

02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:33.120
been getting spam messages like crazy on Gmail, I don't know if it's just me.

02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:34.120
I've been too, I've been too.

02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:38.120
I've been getting so pissed off, and it made, like, I fucking hate spammers.

02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:39.620
I fucking hate them.

02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:41.120
Like, why do they do this?

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:44.120
Like, I mean, they slow down the internet with all their traffic.

02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:48.120
Do people actually buy the shit in these emails?

02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:51.120
Do people actually legitimately believe this stuff?

02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:55.120
Like, and sadly, even if one person out of a million believes it, it's probably worth

02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:00.120
it to these people, but they're just, they're the parasites of pond scum.

02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:01.120
They're, I hate it.

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:02.120
I hate it.

02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:08.120
They stop when they start charging postage on emails, which they shouldn't do, though.

02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:12.120
There's that, there's the, I know, there's a whole, like, double standard thing, but

02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:16.120
they shouldn't do that, but I mean, maybe for mass emails or something they need to.

02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:20.120
I don't know, but I'm getting so irritated with freaking spam email.

02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:22.120
It's sick.

02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:24.120
That's a pretty epic F.E., Rob.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:28.120
Well, we should, seriously, we need to, like, in countries that support spammers, we need

02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:30.120
to just drop a nuclear bomb or something.

02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:31.120
Get rid of these people.

02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:37.120
All right, I'm being a little extreme, but it is just obscene.

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:40.120
Like, we need to do something to stop this.

02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:44.120
And it's not just, like, it's not just that I'm annoyed.

02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:45.120
I am annoyed.

02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:50.120
It's not just that, but the fact that they slow down the internet with their poop that

02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:52.120
flies out of their keyboards.

02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:56.120
I get more spam in my actual Orange Lounge account than I do.

02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:59.120
Seriously, we get inundated with the Orange Lounge.

02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.120
God!

02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:04.120
I'm so sick of spam.

02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:05.120
All right.

02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:11.120
But, you know, it's, unfortunately, it's, you know, part of the hazards of being on

02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.120
the internet.

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:18.120
However, I do not advocate just, you know, sitting back and letting it happen, of course.

02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:23.120
All right, Bobby linked me to a website here with, actually, kind of a clarification, I

02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:27.120
suppose, on the whole, you called the game Gay Tony, but you can't have gay in your

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:34.120
profile or whatever, and this is a website called step2.com, which is, I think he's

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:41.120
a guy who's involved with the, what is he, the community, I don't think he's community

02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:44.120
director or something, but he does stuff with Microsoft.

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:50.120
Anyway, he basically says that the code of conduct policy does allow you to express vocally

02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:52.120
on the service your relationship preference.

02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:56.120
People get this wrong in saying all instances the word gay, for instance, are forbidden

02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:57.120
from all of Xbox Live.

02:19:57.120 --> 02:20:00.120
Therefore, this new download content represents a violation.

02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:01.120
This is not the case.

02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:04.120
I appreciate the appearance of a disconnect, but there isn't.

02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:08.120
There's other content in Grand Theft Auto 4 that would likewise not be allowed in a

02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:09.120
gamertag or profile.

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:13.120
Quotes from movies that you can obtain on Marketplace that are not allowed in gamertags

02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:14.120
or profiles.

02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:18.120
Rated, purchasable content has all sorts of technical rules and restrictions as to what

02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:20.120
type of accounts can view them.

02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:24.120
Limitations, synopsis and plot summary and so forth that gamertags and profiles do not

02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:26.120
currently have.

02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:28.120
I don't know.

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:29.120
I don't know.

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:30.120
I'm still not 100% convinced.

02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:33.120
I'm thankful that they're aware that there's a disconnect here, but I don't know.

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:37.120
I'm not 100% convinced when we do see some of these reports coming out and so forth,

02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:40.120
but I do appreciate the clarification if nothing else.

02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:44.120
And they say they're working with these organizations, et cetera, et cetera.

02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:47.120
They've been working with them for months and months.

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:51.120
Let's see what happens.

02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:52.120
All right.

02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:53.120
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.

02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:55.120
We're almost to the phone.

02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:57.120
Stark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind.

02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:03.120
Well, this is, I don't know.

02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:17.120
Tecmo Bowl for Wii is actually put on hold and is being converted into Family Fun Football.

02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:24.120
They are basically saying that they're switching it to a family-oriented game because of market

02:21:24.120 --> 02:21:27.120
research and to go to the Wii's target audience.

02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:31.120
Because that's everybody that owns the Wii is the family demographic, and they are not

02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:33.120
going to recognize the name Tecmo Bowl.

02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:34.120
So they're selling out.

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:36.120
Sad, but it makes sense.

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:38.120
Makes complete sense, sadly.

02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:43.120
But on Xbox 360, there will be Tecmo Bowl for Xbox Live Arcade, and that will be in

02:21:43.120 --> 02:21:45.120
early 2010.

02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:46.120
Nice.

02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:48.120
So hunt for that at E3.

02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.120
Let us know.

02:21:50.120 --> 02:21:51.120
Cool.

02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:55.120
There's some pretty cool stuff coming over from Exceed.

02:21:55.120 --> 02:22:02.120
They're a company that localizes a lot of games that normally come out in Japan.

02:22:02.120 --> 02:22:04.120
Our modern working designs?

02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:06.120
Yes, basically.

02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:11.120
In fact, some of the cool stuff that they're bringing to E3 this year, Ju-On the Grudge

02:22:11.120 --> 02:22:12.120
for the Wii.

02:22:12.120 --> 02:22:13.120
Sweet!

02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:16.120
The Regile, Farewell, Ruins of the Moon.

02:22:16.120 --> 02:22:19.120
That's actually supposed to be a pretty kick-ass looking game.

02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:23.120
Lunar Silver Star Harmony for the PSP.

02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:25.120
Half Minute Hero for the PSP.

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:28.120
Remember that Yusa 30 game that they had?

02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:30.120
That looks pretty sweet.

02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:33.120
Ark Rise Fantasia.

02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:35.120
Flower, Sun, and Rain.

02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:36.120
Little King's Story.

02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:38.120
Ragnarok Online DS.

02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:39.120
Woohoo!

02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:42.120
And Valhalla Knights Elder Saga.

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:47.120
So lots of cool import-friendly stuff coming from them.

02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:49.120
Probably a booth I'll have to visit.

02:22:49.120 --> 02:22:52.120
Alright, well something else that is going to definitely appeal to some folks out there,

02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:57.120
and maybe not to others, but you might remember there was some talk about a Tony Hawk skateboard

02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:59.120
peripheral coming out very soon.

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:02.120
Well, some more details have leaked on Tony Hawk Ride.

02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:04.120
That is the game, and this is from GameStop.

02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:06.120
The game is coming out October 13th.

02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:09.120
It's going to set you back $120.

02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:13.120
Tony Hawk Ride, which comes with a little skateboard controller.

02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:16.120
So, could be interesting.

02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.120
Could be dangerous, too.

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:22.120
I mean, God, I could just see people breaking their TVs left and right with this thing.

02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:24.120
If you're having a little too much fun.

02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:28.120
But, I mean, I don't know, how much fun can this really be?

02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:31.120
Am I just being a pessimist? How much fun can this really be?

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:34.120
I mean, isn't part of riding a skateboard having wheels?

02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:36.120
I mean, I guess you could make the same argument.

02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:39.120
Well, how much fun is Wii Sports because it's not actual tennis?

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:42.120
Or why do people play Wii Bowling and not actual bowling?

02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:47.120
I don't know. There's something about this specifically that I'm looking at going,

02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:48.120
how can this really be fun?

02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:51.120
This is a little curvy board that sits on your floor. I don't know.

02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:53.120
It'd be like, what was the arcade game?

02:23:53.120 --> 02:23:58.120
But then again, I was defending Wii Fit earlier, so what the hell right do I have to bash this game?

02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.120
I don't know.

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:01.120
Yeah, Rob. No, really.

02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:08.120
It'd be like, though, what was that one Sega game that you, you know, got to do all the...

02:24:08.120 --> 02:24:09.120
The activator?

02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:12.120
No, I'm talking about the arcade.

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:15.120
It would be something along those lines, I think.

02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:16.120
You know...

02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:18.120
Oh, oh God, Alpine Racer.

02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.120
Well, no, they had the skateboard game.

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:24.120
It was similar to that, though. I know what you're talking about.

02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:25.120
A skate or something?

02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:26.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:31.120
I guess, but even that, I don't know, had movement or something.

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:35.120
I mean, it wasn't just a board that was lying on the ground, you know what I mean?

02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:37.120
Like, you actually spun around.

02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.120
I remember that. You used to have the golf lamp back in the day, right?

02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:43.120
It would actually kind of spin around and you had the railings to hold on to.

02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:45.120
Like, this is not going to be that elaborate, you know?

02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:50.120
You still had that feeling of motion in the game because of the whole elaborate setup it had.

02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:52.120
That's true. That is true.

02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:57.120
So, sj100matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelandraday.com says,

02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:00.120
Seriously? $120? I can put that towards a real skateboard.

02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:03.120
Hitstun corrects the name. Top Skater and AirTricks.

02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:06.120
Top Skater, that was it. AirTricks is what I was actually thinking of.

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:10.120
And Rob D says there were two arcade skateboarding games, but I don't remember the names.

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:11.120
Well, there they were.

02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.120
So, there it is.

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.120
Top Skater.

02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:19.120
Yeah, I think that's one of the ones I'm thinking of.

02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:22.120
And I think we had both those games at one point at Golf Land.

02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:25.120
But this isn't it. I'll tell you that much.

02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:30.120
One more story from all of us, then we're going to get to your calls at 1877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.

02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:33.120
But first, a few more stories. DarkSakura.

02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:38.120
Well, how about something for LEGO Indiana Jones? This is kind of cool.

02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:43.120
Well, for LEGO Indiana Jones 2, I should say, is that you're going to be able to build your own stages.

02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:54.120
So, basically, you can do levels, tombs, challenges, sandbox areas, put down plates, traps, all that kind of fun stuff.

02:25:54.120 --> 02:26:00.120
You can actually save everything and go back and do your playthrough again on your homemade level.

02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:03.120
It's like Forge, but for LEGO Indiana Jones.

02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:09.120
Well, now, you're someone that likes to build your own stuff, DarkSakura, so maybe this is something that you'd be interested in?

02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:10.120
Probably not.

02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:14.120
If I can't violently kill people in this, I'm not interested.

02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:17.120
Maybe I can recreate the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland.

02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:19.120
Now that, I would be down for.

02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:21.120
Fire!

02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:24.120
Because that's the whole reason to ride that ride, because you get fire.

02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:25.120
Yes.

02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:32.120
So there's some other stuff that's coming to E3 that's going to be pretty interesting.

02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:37.120
You may remember developer High Voltage, they're bringing out the brand new first person shooter game,

02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:40.120
the Conduit to the Wii, pretty soon.

02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:44.120
It's a game that's kind of pushing the edge of what the Wii can do.

02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:46.120
They have some new games coming out, though.

02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:54.120
The first one being Gladiator AD, an ultra-bloody fighting game that puts you in the role of a roaming gladiator.

02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:56.120
Looks pretty sweet.

02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:03.120
And then, to go along with that, something more like a normal traditional shooter, a game called The Grinder,

02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:07.120
which is going to be kind of like a supernatural shooter game.

02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:11.120
It's got like vampires and stuff like that, and werewolves.

02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:14.120
So, looks kind of cool.

02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:19.120
Actually, sadly enough, this game kind of reminds me a little bit of that game from Gamecock,

02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.120
which I cannot remember for the life of me what it was called.

02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:24.120
Are these games we're going to see at E3?

02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:27.120
I don't know, they were just announced.

02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:30.120
Maybe? I don't know if we...

02:27:30.120 --> 02:27:35.120
Sometimes a game being at E3, though, is just a trailer showing on a monitor, you know what I mean?

02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:37.120
A lot of these games are probably like that.

02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:40.120
It's possible. Maybe we'll see this. I don't know, though.

02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:45.120
Not every game is playable. I think we forget that a lot of shit at E3 is not touchable.

02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:48.120
Like everything from Square Enix.

02:27:48.120 --> 02:27:52.120
Usually. I bet that new Kingdom Hearts game will be playable, though.

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.120
Yeah, it's already out in Japan.

02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:57.120
That, what, 3283 or whatever it's called? Some weird name.

02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:01.120
Again, I don't understand, because I thought this was a series aimed at kind of kids,

02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:04.120
and they do all this weird stuff with it, but I don't know.

02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:06.120
I don't understand some of the Kingdom Hearts logic sometimes.

02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:08.120
I love the games, though. I do. I really do.

02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:12.120
And I know I'm not going to see Kingdom Hearts 3 at this year's E3, and I'm just going to be pissed.

02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:13.120
Oh.

02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:15.120
Are we going to go to the theater?

02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.120
Thank you. Game Guru says 3582 Days is the name of it.

02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:22.120
Yeah, I'd love to go to the theater and check it out if they have it again this year, which I assume they will.

02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:24.120
Because it's always like a waste of time.

02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.120
No, I mean, not that I don't like doing it, but it's like...

02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:30.120
You know what? I actually like seeing the epic Squeenix trailers on the big screen.

02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.120
It's like, oh my god, it's a trailer for Final Fantasy XI.

02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:37.120
Seeing the trailer... Look, I make this comparison.

02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:40.120
What about when you see trailers for movies on the big screen?

02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.120
Like, when you saw the trailer for The Dark Knight for the first time,

02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:47.120
or when you see the trailers for Harry Potter, if you're into that or whatever.

02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:51.120
When you see these trailers on the big screen, isn't it so much better than when you're watching them on your tiny ass computer screen?

02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:52.120
Yeah, it'll be alright.

02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:54.120
Same thing. Same thing.

02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:56.120
It depends. It really depends.

02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:57.120
How so?

02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:00.120
Well, I mean, because really, sometimes there's been...

02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:05.120
I'll just see movies that I really could care less about, honestly.

02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:10.120
So, I was like, um, why did I have to see this big? Why does it have to, you know, be involved in my life right now?

02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:13.120
So, that's what I mean.

02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:16.120
Alright. Well, let's move on to one more gaming story,

02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:19.120
and then we're gonna take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:21.120
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadial.

02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:27.120
Please make sure, if you're gonna use Skype, make sure you've tested your call with echo123 as the username on Skype.

02:29:27.120 --> 02:29:29.120
We had some issues last week with some of our callers,

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:32.120
so please make sure that your volume's okay by giving echo123 a call.

02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:35.120
We got one more story for you guys, though, before we get to the phones,

02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:37.120
and it has to do with the DSi,

02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:42.120
and I guess this is one of those, uh, you knew this rumor would show up at some point.

02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:45.120
I'm sure it's come up before. Well, guess what? It's coming up again.

02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:50.120
Apparently, as you know, the DSi had the Game Boy Advance port removed from the game.

02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:55.120
Well, could this possibly be because something a little shadier is in store?

02:29:55.120 --> 02:30:00.120
You're gonna soon be able to download Game Boy Advance titles onto your DSi,

02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:03.120
just like you download old-school Nintendo games to your Wii.

02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:10.120
Pretty soon, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games on your DSi through the DSiWare store.

02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:12.120
And move goes the cow.

02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:17.120
I know, and the sheep will herd into this and, uh, buy this crap, I'm sure.

02:30:17.120 --> 02:30:19.120
Tons and tons.

02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:20.120
No, I don't know, though. There might be-

02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:25.120
And at the same time, why can't they just put this stuff on the Wii?

02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:27.120
I mean, like these Game Boy Advance titles and stuff.

02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:31.120
Hey, or some other functionality, and maybe you can tie your accounts together,

02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:36.120
and then if you download a Game Boy Advance title on the Wii, you can take it with you on your DSi.

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:40.120
That would be cool and innovative, which will never happen.

02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:45.120
I think some people forgot, as well, we had a Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.

02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:46.120
Yes, I remember that.

02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:48.120
So they can put those games on your TV.

02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:51.120
Game Boy Color player on the Super NES.

02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:56.120
That's right. So they can put it on your TV, so don't listen to that garbage that they can't do it.

02:30:56.120 --> 02:30:57.120
Because they can. They have.

02:30:57.120 --> 02:31:00.120
Yeah, I was about to just say that they can and have.

02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:05.120
But, I mean, honestly, though, you know what the deal is for them.

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:09.120
In the end, the only thing that it is is the bottom line.

02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:10.120
I know, and there will be-

02:31:10.120 --> 02:31:11.120
And they can make money.

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:15.120
It's instant money. It's free money. They're gonna find free money wherever they can.

02:31:15.120 --> 02:31:19.120
That's the plan. Anyhow, let's go to the phones. They're ringing off the hook tonight.

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:21.120
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:22.120
It's GS68.

02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:25.120
Hello, GS68. How you doing?

02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:28.120
Alright, I'm here to talk about Fanime.

02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:33.120
That's right. I don't think you were there last week while our show was going on, so how was fun?

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:39.120
Yeah, unlike last year, I didn't get to call in at all, or listen at all.

02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:44.120
That's alright. We had a short show last week because of the holidays, so we didn't end up doing a whole lot.

02:31:44.120 --> 02:31:46.120
And Loki wasn't here, so...

02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:49.120
And I know it hasn't gone on the podcast feed yet, but it will soon.

02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:52.120
So, what's on your mind? How was the con? Tell us about it.

02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:59.120
It was pretty good. I was mostly in the gaming room this year, and I saw the most badass 2DX setup.

02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:06.120
Like, someone had actual arcade hardware hooked up to a PS2 with one of the PS2 versions of 2DX,

02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:11.120
so my one complaint was that it was not an HDTV, so it was very laggy.

02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:14.120
That's pretty cool. What else was in the game room?

02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:21.120
What else? They had a bunch of scrolling shooters, like Radiant Silvergun and Gradius.

02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:25.120
One of my friends brought his Tetris of Grandmaster arcade board, so I got to play that.

02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:30.120
Did they still have, like, one thing I remember from the last Fanime I went to, which was a couple years ago,

02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:36.120
tons and tons and tons of DS gamers, like, you know, all playing the Japanese games and stuff,

02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:40.120
and beaming the games to each other, like, there's just tons of that that goes on.

02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:46.120
I didn't really need some DS so much this year, but I will say this for the Bomani fans,

02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:52.120
the arcade finally had an actual version of Pop'n Music, not Animelo 2, thankfully.

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:55.120
Hmm. Alright.

02:32:55.120 --> 02:32:56.120
Oh, that's...

02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:57.120
No, go ahead.

02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:00.120
Yeah, instead of Pop'n Music, Animelo 2 did Pop'n 14.

02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:04.120
That's good. That's definitely worthwhile.

02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:10.120
How about anime stuff? I know we don't talk a lot about anime on this show, but did you see some cool stuff going on?

02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:14.120
Like, any cool panels that you saw? I know we weren't there this year, but...

02:33:14.120 --> 02:33:19.120
I went to one gathering, but it wasn't as good as the same one from last year,

02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:27.120
and I went to a panel called Bonstar Cave. This is a video game trivia show panel thingy, and it was pretty awesome.

02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:33.120
That's one thing I really want to get into doing, these cons, these game show type things, because I think it would be a lot of fun.

02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:40.120
Like, a lot of references to older video games, like 16-bit video games,

02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:49.120
like, your questions are represented by enemies, and so do enemies, or versions of enemies from older games,

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:53.120
like Mr. Batty from Earthbound, or Dr. Robotnik with 12 balls and chains,

02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:58.120
or this Labyrinth Zone dance party thing where if you get the question right, it ends,

02:33:58.120 --> 02:34:02.120
but if you get it wrong, you get a sonic drowning if you get it drowned.

02:34:02.120 --> 02:34:06.120
Interesting. Some people have a lot of time. A lot of free time on their hands.

02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:11.120
You know what's... I gotta say this, because I don't think I ever said this about Anime Central when I was talking about this,

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:19.120
that was the most recent con I went to, but one of the panels that they were supposed to do was, like, live recreations of cases from Phoenix Wright,

02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:23.120
where they were going to basically do the cases from Phoenix Wright as a play, at least that's how it read in the book.

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:28.120
I remember that one, and even though I went to the Ace Attorney gathering...

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:34.120
It was not what we thought it would be. We tried to go there to the panel, and it was hard to hear,

02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:39.120
they weren't really reading off a script, they were just kind of making it up, it seems we left after five minutes, it wasn't...

02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:44.120
We were like, god damn it, this seemed so much better in the panel, like, this could have been epic!

02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:48.120
Objection! You know, they could have gone off the script from the game and it would have been beautiful.

02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:58.120
Yeah, what else... I went to the cosplay chess, which is like, basically you have a chess board, two people playing chess, and then you have a bigger chess board,

02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:05.120
where they represent the chess gameplay on the huge board with cosplayers, that was pretty fun.

02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:09.120
Any good video game cosplay that you saw?

02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:17.120
A whole lot, hold on, let me just post my pictures from the bottom in the chat room.

02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:22.120
It has a chat.orangelaungeradio.com, if you want to check that out, I see the link there.

02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:31.120
Yeah, I saw a few video game cosplay gatherings, and I cosplayed as a character myself, and that was kind of funny.

02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:39.120
Like, I went to my apologizes cosplay, and a lot of people recognized me, and I went to my pop-in cosplay, and only three people recognized me.

02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.120
Then again, I wasn't really surprised.

02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:46.120
What would you say was the best video game cosplay you saw?

02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.120
I'm not sure.

02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:51.120
Like...

02:35:51.120 --> 02:36:03.120
Yeah, I saw Captain Commander cosplay, and that was pretty cool, because the cosplayer had neon lights on his costume, which was awesome.

02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:08.120
Alright, fair enough. Well, gs68, any other thoughts about Phantom 8 before we let you go and take some more calls?

02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:17.120
Um, yeah, I went to YaliCon Bingo for the hell of it. I didn't win anything, but...

02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:19.120
YaliCon Bingo.

02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:20.120
Yes.

02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:26.120
This sounds like one of those things I have to experience at least once in my life. I've heard of YaliCon for probably ten years now, and I've never really gone.

02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:27.120
You probably should.

02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:30.120
I've been to YaliCon before, Rob, it's interesting.

02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:31.120
Maybe at some point.

02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:36.120
Yeah, I might go to YaliCon this year, but only for one day. Same with that anime summer version.

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:41.120
Oh, okay. Well, maybe we haven't had sac animes in our neck of the woods, we haven't been there in forever. We'll see.

02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:48.120
Alright, we gotta let you go though so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much gs68, I'm glad to hear you had a fun time at Phantom 8, and we should be back next year.

02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:50.120
Alright, see you next year then.

02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:51.120
Later!

02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:56.120
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:36:56.120 --> 02:36:57.120
Hey, it's Rama.

02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:58.120
Hey Rama, how you doing?

02:36:58.120 --> 02:36:59.120
Hi!

02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:00.120
Not much.

02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:02.120
Scott, I have a bit of a bone to pick with you now.

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.120
Oh, Jesus, what?

02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:09.120
Not all spam is bad. Sometimes it's pretty tasty between a couple slices of bread.

02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:12.120
I hate you.

02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:14.120
You know what I meant.

02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:18.120
I know, but you opened the door for me. You don't do that.

02:37:18.120 --> 02:37:23.120
I did. Hey, you got me back for the purple spaceship from earlier in the show, so there you go.

02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:25.120
Oh, that was a good play. I loved it. That was a good play.

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:31.120
The chat room is telling me to hang up on you for that, so you better talk quick to save yourself. What else is on your mind?

02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:34.120
Two words. Anime Boston.

02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:37.120
Alright, how was Anime Boston?

02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:45.120
Seriously, it lacked. It just didn't have the same oomph or feeling as the last Anime Boston that I've attended.

02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:49.120
You know, I've been going since the first year.

02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:59.120
I would guess it probably lacked because every year it's so packed full of people, it takes you instead of like 10 minutes to get from point A to point B, maybe 20 minutes.

02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:05.120
Now it takes five minutes. I'm just guessing because they've redesigned the logistics of where everything was this year.

02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:12.120
Let me ask you a question that came up last week. One of our other listeners went to Anime Boston. We were kind of grilling him on it a little bit.

02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:23.120
And one thing that we asked about was the location, because apparently the place that they have Anime Boston is where they're going to have Penny Arcade Expo East Coast version is the same venue.

02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:26.120
Will it fit?

02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:39.120
I've been saying no, no, and no. Because the convention center holds like maybe we're between 10,000 to 15,000 people and AB has hit anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 and it has been jam-packed.

02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:51.120
If they do it right, they may be able to pull it off. If not, when you get there late Friday afternoon or Friday evening, don't be too surprised to see signs on the door that says fail to capacity due to fire code.

02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:58.120
Wow. Rob D. in chat clarifies they are estimating 20,000 people for PAX East. They're insane.

02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:10.120
And if that's the case, the Hines might just be able to pull it off. It is three floors. It's not tremendously huge as like the Baltimore Convention Center which can hold about 24,000 people.

02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:12.120
I can see the Hines maybe half that.

02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:18.120
They'll probably spill into some neighboring facilities and some of the hotels that I imagine are right nearby there. Like that's kind of what ASEN does.

02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:25.120
They have the convention center, but they also spill into the nearby hotels. So I'm sure PAX will do something like that if there's that much demand there.

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:31.120
Yeah, because it's like there's two hotels attached to the Hind and there's two more hotels within walking distance.

02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:40.120
Interesting. Anything else on your mind tonight? Actually, I want to ask you real quick, what did you see on a Boston GamingWise that you wanted to share with us?

02:39:40.120 --> 02:39:43.120
DDR4thMix Plus Machine.

02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:45.120
Epic win. I missed that one.

02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:52.120
And I also discovered what the whole Nintendo booth was and since you went to ASEN, you probably saw it too.

02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:53.120
Hmm.

02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:55.120
You didn't see it?

02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:57.120
No, the Nintendo booth?

02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:01.120
Yeah, it was in the dealer's room. They had a complete display for Fire Emblem.

02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:05.120
Yes, they did. They were selling the hell out of that new Fire Emblem game, yeah.

02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:07.120
Yes, yes it was.

02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:16.120
Indeed. I keep forgetting that I thought that was the makers, I guess it was Nintendo publishing it, but I thought for some reason, I don't know, it didn't click on my mind. I'm slow.

02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:20.120
But yeah, I definitely saw that on the floor. They were a very popular booth.

02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:25.120
Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you go to get in some more calls and then go wrap up the show, so thanks so much for calling, okay?

02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:27.120
No problem. Take care, guys.

02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:28.120
Later, bud.

02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:29.120
Later.

02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:32.120
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype.

02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.120
Orange Lounge Radio is the phone number to call.

02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:41.120
We'll take a few more calls before we leave you guys tonight.

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:47.120
I just answered one and they hung up right away. I think somebody is redialing so fast that they're not actually able to get through.

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:50.120
I think we got one call here, though. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:52.120
This is Ingo.

02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.120
Hey, Ingo! Good, I was wondering how to say that. What's on your mind, Ingo?

02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:08.120
Nothing really much. I was wondering, is it worth 200 bucks to get a 360? I already have a PS3, but I was just wondering.

02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:14.120
The golden rule of gaming, we've said time and again here on Orange Lounge Radio, is a console is only as good as the games that are on it.

02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:18.120
You have to really look at what's available on the Xbox 360, and you have to look.

02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:25.120
Are these games that I can't get on the PlayStation 3, or are these games giving me an experience I can't get on the PlayStation 3?

02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:28.120
I'm phrasing it like that to you because you already own a PlayStation 3.

02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:33.120
Most people are usually going the other way around where they already have the Xbox and want to get the PlayStation 3.

02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:36.120
Or they don't have either of them and they want to know which one of the two to buy.

02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:42.120
Usually I push people towards the Xbox 360 because they have, in my opinion, the better exclusives.

02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:47.120
Whereas, if you're looking for a multimedia thing, the PlayStation 3 obviously has the Blu-ray.

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:51.120
It's got the better web and all that stuff. It makes a better multimedia box.

02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:56.120
But since you already have that, you're really going to have to look at the Xbox exclusive games.

02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:05.120
Are you somebody that plays Halo? Are you somebody that plays Mass Effect 1 and some of these other games that are exclusive on Xbox 360?

02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:07.120
I'm having a total brain lapse right now. What are some of the other games?

02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:08.120
Here's a War.

02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:10.120
Here's a War. DDR Universe.

02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:11.120
Fable 2.

02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:14.120
Yeah. Are these games of interest to you?

02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:19.120
No, I'll have to think about it for a little bit. Just some exclusive games.

02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:22.120
Well, here's my question to you and you should ask yourself the same thing.

02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:28.120
If I were to drop $200 on Xbox 360, what would be the first game I'd play on it?

02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:31.120
For me, it'd probably be Grand Theft Auto IV.

02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:37.120
Well, there you go. But see, Grand Theft Auto IV is also a game that you can get on the PlayStation 3.

02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:40.120
But, of course, Xbox 360 also has the multiplayer.

02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:46.120
Well, they have the multiplayer in the PS3 as well. They have the expansions. That's pretty much it for right now.

02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:50.120
The multiplayer on the PS3 sucks.

02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:56.120
Are you happy with the PlayStation 3 or are you a little disgruntled with where they've gone with it?

02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:01.120
And that's why you're thinking about maybe going to Xbox?

02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:08.120
I'm really happy with my PS3 because, well, yeah, I don't know why.

02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:14.120
But, no, I really shouldn't until it sort of went down.

02:43:14.120 --> 02:43:18.120
But, yeah, I got a 500GB PS3 now, so...

02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:22.120
Nice, a modded PS3. And, hey, maybe you can get one of those phones where you can stream your pornography

02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:25.120
at anywhere you want in the world over 3G.

02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:27.120
No, I'm not one of those people.

02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:31.120
All right. I'm trying to think of what else I want to ask you in regards to this...

02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:36.120
Wait until after E3 and that's all their new games. You can see if there's anything that tickles your fancy.

02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:38.120
You know what? That's a really good point as well.

02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:43.120
With all these rumors of the motion control device and everything that Xbox is supposed to be coming out,

02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:45.120
maybe that's going to be your incentive.

02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.120
And there also might be a price drop or two.

02:43:47.120 --> 02:43:52.120
So definitely don't buy anything until at least after, what, noon tomorrow after the press conference is done.

02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:54.120
They're just waiting till the holidays.

02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:56.120
Yeah, if you can wait that long.

02:43:56.120 --> 02:43:59.120
If you were to tell me that, Loki, and I really wanted an Xbox 360, I'd be like,

02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:01.120
No, I can't wait that long. I want it now.

02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:04.120
I'll pay the extra 100 bucks. I don't care. I want it now.

02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:07.120
I mean, any of us that buy a console the first day it comes out,

02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:09.120
we all know the damn thing is going to drop.

02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:11.120
I don't know what you're talking about.

02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:14.120
Who was it that paid how much for an Xbox 360?

02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:15.120
$700.

02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:16.120
That's what I thought. Thank you very much.

02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:17.120
I also own five of them.

02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:19.120
Thank you very much. Case in point.

02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:21.120
Sorry, Ingo.

02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:23.120
Well, good luck to you.

02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:26.120
I hope you are able to figure it out.

02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:30.120
And let us know if you do end up buying the Xbox 360 and what you do play on it.

02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:32.120
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:39.120
Um, Loki, you should check your friend requests on your PS3.

02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:46.120
I haven't been on my PS3. Well, I have been on my PS3, but not browsing games.

02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.120
We've been streaming the porn.

02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:49.120
Watching porn, exactly.

02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:51.120
We've been streaming movies out of it.

02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:53.120
But yeah, I haven't been on PlayStation Network in a while.

02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:56.120
Black Wolf would like to remind everybody that he is Loki's only friend.

02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:58.120
Not anymore, Black Wolf. Sorry.

02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:01.120
Oh, you cheated on him. I would cry if I were Bobby.

02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:03.120
Alright, Ingo, we're going to let you go to get a couple more calls and get out of here.

02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:05.120
But have a good night, okay?

02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:06.120
You too.

02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:07.120
Later, bud.

02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:10.120
What was I going to say? The Rob D. in chat says, because Motion on the 360...

02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:12.120
Oh, actually, this is his call.

02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:14.120
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:15.120
What's up, guys? It's the Rob D.

02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:17.120
I was just about to read one of your comments in chat.

02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:21.120
You put, because Motion on the 360 is going to be good. Laugh.

02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:22.120
Yeah, I know.

02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:24.120
What if it is? What if it is, Rob?

02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:29.120
Um, then I'll gladly eat ecro, but I really doubt it's actually going to be good.

02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:31.120
You really think it's going to be anything more than a gimmick?

02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:33.120
It's a cup of mayonnaise tonight, Rob.

02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:35.120
I don't know if you were here earlier in the night.

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:38.120
Honestly, there is going to be a motion controller regardless of this camera thing,

02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:46.120
because the third-party game accessory developer, PDP, is putting out their Magic Wand controller thing.

02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:49.120
It has a game that comes with it called Squeeballs.

02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:51.120
And it looks like the Wii remote.

02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:56.120
As long as I can waggle my Squeeballs, I'll be good.

02:45:56.120 --> 02:46:01.120
Wow. You know, there could be something good out of this. I don't know.

02:46:01.120 --> 02:46:03.120
You know, it might be a hell of a party thing.

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:07.120
I don't think it's something I'm going to sit there and play in the room by myself,

02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:09.120
look at me flailing about like an asshole.

02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:11.120
Oh my god, did we get a totem ball sequel?

02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:13.120
Can I buy another useless camera?

02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:17.120
I'd somehow don't think Rob called in tonight to talk about Microsoft Motion Control.

02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:20.120
Let me turn it over to Rob. What's on your mind tonight?

02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:23.120
Well, I have to ask you guys to bear with me a little bit, because I'm currently sick,

02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:25.120
and I'm coughing all over the place.

02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:28.120
I have no voice, and I've been doing the show all night tonight, so it's fine.

02:46:28.120 --> 02:46:32.120
Would you like your third convention report of the night, since I went to Anime North in Toronto?

02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:36.120
Apparently we are the convention hub on the internet.

02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:37.120
I guess so.

02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:41.120
We should just name ourselves the convention cast. That's all right. How was it?

02:46:41.120 --> 02:46:44.120
It was fun. Toronto is actually a really cool city.

02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.120
It's the first time I've been there in about a decade,

02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:50.120
and though they don't really care too much for copyright infringement,

02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:54.120
as you can see from the picture I just posted in chat, which is hilarious,

02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.120
it was a great place to have a convention, even though it was a little bit outside the city,

02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:03.120
but I managed to have a friend show me around anyway.

02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:05.120
So you actually got to see the city when you went to the convention,

02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:09.120
because when I went to Chicago, I saw a little bit of downtown.

02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:11.120
That was when we got lost one night. That was about it.

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:15.120
Wow, I'm looking at this picture. Mario Brothers Fast Foods, apparently.

02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:19.120
Totally unrelated to the Mario Brothers. They're the Mario Bros.

02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:23.120
Do they serve Mario broth soup there or something? What the hell?

02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:25.120
I don't know. You can actually see they're under renovation.

02:47:25.120 --> 02:47:31.120
I would have totally eaten there, but I decided to eat this little concoction for lunch instead,

02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:33.120
something called poutine.

02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:36.120
Oh, God, yes, I've heard of this. That's the Canadian, it's like the French fries and gravy, right?

02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:37.120
Yeah, it's fantastic.

02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:42.120
French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. If that doesn't stop your heart, I don't know what will.

02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:43.120
It's a beautiful stuff.

02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:44.120
But either way, the convention, though.

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:48.120
Instant pancreas attack right there if I eat that. All right, sorry, convention, yes.

02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:53.120
The Friday was kind of interesting because I saw on the schedule that they had something called Anime Pro Wrestling,

02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:57.120
and I thought it was a total joke, but no, they actually got some independent wrestling promotion

02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:04.120
to actually have Anime Pro Wrestling, and they had me when they had Scorpion and Sub-Zero versus Inspector Gumshoe

02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:06.120
and the guy from Helsing, so...

02:48:06.120 --> 02:48:08.120
Wow.

02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:13.120
Video game related, the game room, I know this is a theme with me lately, but the game room kind of sucked.

02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:17.120
You know how you said it's great when the conventions actually spill over into the surrounding hotels?

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:18.120
Mm-hmm.

02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:21.120
It's not so great when that surrounding hotel is a half mile away.

02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:23.120
Oh, yeah, that's not good.

02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:28.120
That sounds very Anime Expo, which is why I quit going.

02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:32.120
Yeah, I went over there for most of Saturday, and of course they ended up scrapping the Street Fighter IV tournament

02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:38.120
three hours after it was supposed to start, but I'm not bitter, not at all.

02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:44.120
I went there on the Morian, all they had to play was Brawl, a pinball game on the PS2, I don't even know what it was,

02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:49.120
and SBC Chaos, oh, and Ikaruga, which is, I guess that's fun.

02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:54.120
But the real highlight of the convention was me taking a picture with the voice of Link, Nobuyuki Hiyama,

02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:59.120
and the voice of Joe Higashi, the voice of Vyral, the voice of Siegfried from Soul Calibur.

02:48:59.120 --> 02:49:02.120
They got some pretty good celebs up there in Canadian, don't they?

02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:04.120
I know, right?

02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:05.120
Wow.

02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:06.120
That was a ton of fun.

02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:09.120
I'm looking at the picture right now, there you are, there he is.

02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:11.120
Too bad it wasn't the voice of Navi.

02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:16.120
Hey, listen, hey, listen, I would love to get that person to do a bumper for OLR.

02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:22.120
Hey, listen, hey, listen, to OLR.

02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:25.120
Sorry, I don't know what the hell possessed me for that.

02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:34.120
Alright, so on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blow your mind, awesome, con of the year, like, better than Penny Arcade Expo,

02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:39.120
1 being, oh my god, this sucked, where would you rate this convention?

02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:42.120
I'd rate it at about a solid 8, I expect Otacon to be better,

02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:48.120
because last year at Otacon was just a really great experience, and especially since I have a panel at Otacon this year, it's going to be a ton of fun.

02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:50.120
Of course, that makes everything better. Rob D panel makes everything better.

02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:52.120
The only thing better than a Rob D panel?

02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:54.120
Is a Sky panel.

02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:55.120
That's right.

02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:57.120
I'm just messing.

02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:02.120
Alright, Rob, we've got to let you go so we can go wrap up the show, but thank you for making our show now with more Poutin.

02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:03.120
I appreciate that.

02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:04.120
You know it.

02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:05.120
Alright, take care.

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:06.120
You always need more French fries and cheese carrots.

02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:07.120
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:08.120
See you later, man.

02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:09.120
Bye.

02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:16.120
Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skyline tonight. Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're at about 9.20 in between this and our afterbirth and everything.

02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:18.120
We don't want to be here too late tonight.

02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:21.120
So, we're going to go ahead and go around and wrap everything up.

02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:23.120
Again, remember, if you guys didn't get through, we do need more emails always.

02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:26.120
Put Jamie to work. Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send him.

02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:28.120
Hey, I'm not here to work.

02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:30.120
Alright, Dark Sakura, I'm going to make you work right now.

02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:32.120
Oh, actually, I want to go around and see if there's any last-minute stories.

02:50:32.120 --> 02:50:34.120
I know it was a busy Newsweek. Do you have anything, Dark Sakura?

02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:35.120
I don't.

02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:37.120
Loki, I know you've got to have something.

02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:39.120
Yes, I do. Of course.

02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.120
Just some last-minute stories.

02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:44.120
ESRB is rated Final Fantasy VII for the PS3 and the PSP.

02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:45.120
What?

02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:50.120
Basically, the PlayStation Network version of it where you can download the PlayStation 1 game.

02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:59.120
Most people's guess is that it's going to come out with the release of the Blu-ray of Final Fantasy Advent Children Complete since that's when it came out in Japan.

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:01.120
So, in a few more weeks.

02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:09.120
Another surprise Sony-related. Apparently, there was a Sony PlayStation blog E3 2009 meetup in LA.

02:51:09.120 --> 02:51:15.120
Well, apparently, the first hundred people in line also got E3 passes, so lucky them.

02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:19.120
Let's see here.

02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:23.120
That is very lucky. I would like to know if any of our listeners were one of those hundred people.

02:51:23.120 --> 02:51:26.120
Remember, I'm looking for hugs at E3 if you are.

02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:31.120
There's a rumor to another game being announced for the Halo series.

02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:42.120
Apparently, from the Bungie blog, their search engine has a drop-down where you can search specific forums, and one of those forums was Halo Reach.

02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:46.120
And that's different than, I guess, the Halo 3 forum and the Halo ODST.

02:51:46.120 --> 02:51:48.120
And certainly a better name than Halo Reach around.

02:51:48.120 --> 02:51:50.120
Yes, it is.

02:51:50.120 --> 02:52:01.120
Ubisoft is bringing more game show based games to the Wii, including Press Your Luck, Family Feud, and they're going to do another Price is Right game.

02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:02.120
Fuck no.

02:52:02.120 --> 02:52:04.120
Price is Right is pretty...

02:52:04.120 --> 02:52:07.120
I'm just kidding. I haven't played the Price is Right game.

02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:08.120
It might be interesting.

02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:10.120
By the way, completely unrelated, but I have to ask.

02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:18.120
Did anyone see that clip on the internet of the Price is Right episode from last week where this contestant got so excited she jumped up on Drew Carey and kneed him in the balls?

02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:19.120
Oh my god.

02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:21.120
Like it was an accident thing. She didn't mean to do it.

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:23.120
But she totally kneed him in the balls and took him down.

02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:25.120
Like he was like, oh my god.

02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:27.120
I think it was on TMZ or something if you have to see it.

02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:28.120
It's hilarious.

02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:29.120
Sorry, completely random.

02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:31.120
But fuck yes to Press Your Luck.

02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:41.120
They have a Splinter Cell banner, of course, outside of the LA Convention Center kind of confirming still that it's an Xbox 360 exclusive.

02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:43.120
No big surprise there.

02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:47.120
And some other homebrew stuff actually interesting.

02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:51.120
There's a project someone's working on called Metroid 2.5.

02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:56.120
It's going to be kind of a 2.5D version of Metroid 2 and kind of 3.

02:52:56.120 --> 02:53:00.120
Oh, in other words, what Metroid on the GameCube should have been, in my opinion.

02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:03.120
There's a lot of Prime fans that would disagree with me.

02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:05.120
It's quite different than what you would think.

02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:17.120
It's actually really weird. Like Super Paper Mario almost, but not Metroid. Mega Man, I'm sorry. Mega Man 2.5.

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:20.120
Oh, well, you changed everything.

02:53:20.120 --> 02:53:21.120
Not Metroid.

02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:26.120
No, there is still a Metroid 2.5 type of game that's coming out that someone's making.

02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:28.120
That Metroid 2 fusion thing.

02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:30.120
That looked interesting.

02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:35.120
And then there is another homebrew game that's coming out on the DS.

02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:38.120
Someone's porting Patapon to the DS.

02:53:38.120 --> 02:53:41.120
It actually looks kind of cool. They have some gameplay footage of that online.

02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:48.120
And also, you may remember there was a Chrono Trigger sequel that someone was making out of a hacked ROM.

02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:54.120
Chrono Trigger, Crimson Echoes, and Square Enix had kind of put a stop to that game.

02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:56.120
Well, the ROM leaked out.

02:53:56.120 --> 02:54:01.120
I fucking told you this would happen. I fucking said it that night that we covered this story.

02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:07.120
It's going to leak anyway, and they're going to be like, oops, I didn't know, sorry guys, didn't know, didn't mean to.

02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:09.120
We all knew it was going to come out anyway.

02:54:09.120 --> 02:54:14.120
Originally, they thought it was going to be the 98% finished version of it, but now it's an alpha version of it.

02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:16.120
So it's not complete, but it's...

02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:17.120
Oh, well...

02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:18.120
Complete enough?

02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:19.120
...tricky around it.

02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:22.120
No, you wait. There will be a 100% version that shows up soon enough.

02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:23.120
Just you wait.

02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:24.120
Yeah.

02:54:24.120 --> 02:54:27.120
They'll be able to get away with it. Oh, well, we followed the seasons. We didn't know.

02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:30.120
And is Squeenus going to lose any money? No.

02:54:30.120 --> 02:54:33.120
So if they just go after these guys, they're just going to be jerks.

02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:35.120
Asses?

02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:39.120
Yeah, so yeah, I am not surprised one bit that that came out.

02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:42.120
And there's millions of people downloading it now, I'm sure.

02:54:42.120 --> 02:54:43.120
Millions of Chrono Trigger games.

02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:44.120
I better include myself.

02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:47.120
I know. I'm like, things to do when I get home.

02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:53.120
And then finally, there's a new music game coming out from the founders of Rockstar Games.

02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:58.120
Actually, the founders of the developer did Grand Theft Auto, the original game.

02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:01.120
4 millimeters, I guess, is the studio.

02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:05.120
And apparently, they have a game called Def Jam Rapstar.

02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:09.120
Kind of the urban version of Singstar, if you will.

02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:11.120
That will be at E3.

02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:12.120
Yippee.

02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:13.120
And that's it.

02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:17.120
Alright. We're getting out of here. We're done for the night.

02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:18.120
Are we?

02:55:18.120 --> 02:55:20.120
We gotta wrap up, yeah. We gotta do our live-only segment real quick.

02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:23.120
And then get out of here. It's almost 10 o'clock on the west coast, if you can believe it.

02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:26.120
Long show tonight, but we had a lot of news. What did you expect?

02:55:26.120 --> 02:55:28.120
Really? I mean, we've got E3 coming up.

02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:29.120
Exactly.

02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:30.120
Wait till next time.

02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:34.120
And if we are here next Sunday, which I don't see why we wouldn't be, but we'll see.

02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:35.120
We'll see, yeah.

02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:38.120
Maybe like a short show Sunday. That's what I'm thinking is gonna happen.

02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:40.120
Maybe we'll do, well, we'll talk.

02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:43.120
Because I know Bobby might want to go along because this is his 200th show.

02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:44.120
We'll worry about it later.

02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:48.120
I know we gotta do some type of E3 impression show. We've got to.

02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:51.120
And Dark Sakura, since you're not going, you gotta keep an eye on it from home.

02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:52.120
I guess.

02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:54.120
And keep an eye on all the blogs and all that fun stuff.

02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:55.120
I guess.

02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:01.120
Alright. Anyhow, let's see. We're gonna wrap up and get on out of here.

02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:05.120
Everybody's final thought tonight. Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought?

02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:08.120
I made my garage too big.

02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:10.120
Loki, your final thought?

02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:13.120
I have to play more fuel and then kill some sims.

02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:19.120
My final thought is I gotta check out this fuel as well and I'm looking forward to going to E3.

02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:22.120
And remember I'm looking for hugs and just to meet more people.

02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:26.120
So if you do happen to see me out there at E3, please stop and say hello.

02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:27.120
I'm not-

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:28.120
Post it.

02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:31.120
I promise I'm not mean. Just come up and say hi. Introduce yourself.

02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:34.120
Ask anyone who met me at ASEN or anything. I swear I'm not mean.

02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:35.120
Like I will-

02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:36.120
But I am.

02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:38.120
Yes, but Loki is, so avoid him at all costs.

02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:39.120
I am too.

02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:43.120
But if I'm with Loki, then you're okay because I will keep him in check and he won't be mean to you.

02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:48.120
Alright, in reality, actually Loki is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. It's just a radio persona.

02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:49.120
It's all a lie.

02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:51.120
It's all a lie. I'm absolutely mean.

02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:56.120
I hate to break it to you guys here, but the mean guy persona is all a lie.

02:56:56.120 --> 02:57:02.120
Ah, great. They're gonna have Tony Arx right at the Microsoft E3 keynote. That's gonna be boring to watch.

02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:08.120
Hooray. Maybe that's why they suddenly did the five minute increase or whatever in time.

02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:12.120
The Rob Dean chat says, Sky punched me in the face and threw a drink at me.

02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:15.120
In true diva fashion.

02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:19.120
Alright, no really, we're out of here. Thanks you guys. Have a wonderful night.

02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:24.120
Thank you as always for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and our little show here.

02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:28.120
Remember, if you like the show, all we ask is to tell two people about our little show here.

02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:31.120
And to help spread the word because word of mouth is all we got.

02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:34.120
