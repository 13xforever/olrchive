27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	45000	I'm with you here every week. Rob Roberts also joining you tonight.
45000	48000	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48000	49000	Hi.
49000	52000	Always here with us as usual. How you doing?
52000	54000	I'm recovering.
54000	56000	Recovering? Are you an alcoholic?
56000	57000	No.
57000	58000	Sorry to hear it.
58000	59000	From the week from hell.
59000	61000	I'm sorry to hear about the week from hell.
61000	63000	Was there a lot of gaming to be done in the week from hell?
63000	65000	Some, actually. A little.
65000	70000	Alright, we'll get to that in just a moment, but we can't start the show without introducing the one and only tech master, Loki!
70000	71000	Hello.
71000	72000	How you doing?
72000	73000	Good.
73000	76000	And I see your normal Sunday ration of fast food.
76000	77000	You have some Burger King tonight.
77000	78000	Yes.
78000	79000	Sticking with the traditionals.
79000	86000	I was going to get McDonald's, but I had somehow was in a daze and drove past it and went to Burger King instead.
86000	92000	How exactly do you select what your fast grub is going to be before the show before you get here?
92000	93000	What I feel like.
93000	94000	Just what you feel like?
94000	95000	Yeah.
95000	96000	What you going to stop at on the way?
96000	104000	I was driving home from Oakland right before the show, so I wouldn't have been able to stop somewhere healthy because it takes a lot longer.
104000	117000	And unfortunately fast food didn't take quite as, it wasn't as fast as I had hoped because an idiot in front of me decided to use a coupon for their fast food order and the coupon didn't apply to what they had ordered.
117000	122000	So he sat there arguing with them for a good 10 minutes and that sucked.
122000	130000	Misty in our chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com starts us off tonight wanting to know, but the question is what kind of BK noms?
130000	132000	Double bacon cheeseburger.
132000	134000	Oh, very healthy.
134000	137000	Exactly. It's very delicious.
137000	149000	All right, and Black Wolf, the gentleman before us here on Sunday nights when we tape live on all games radio at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, Black Wolf is in chat and says, hey, I heard this was a show about video games.
149000	153000	Once in a while, once in a while we do talk about video games. In fact, let's get to it.
153000	156000	We always like to start off a little bit of how is your gaming week?
156000	158000	There's no guests tonight, just you guys in the chat room.
158000	162000	Chat.orangelaundry.com. We'll start off tonight with Dark Soccer. How was your gaming week?
162000	167000	I played Cooking Mama on iPhone while waiting for Wolverine to start.
167000	174000	The rest of it was spent on homework. All week homework. The end.
174000	183000	What do you think about the fact that they play those ads before movies? Like, you know, while they have a captive audience, they're showing previews for TV shows and all this garbage.
183000	184000	I was ignoring them.
184000	187000	You think it's smart or you think it's annoying? It cuts into your Cooking Mama time.
187000	194000	It's annoying, but it is smart marketing. So, I try not to think of it one way or another.
194000	202000	The bottom line is all that matters to the companies. So, of course, they're going to try to get the word out there in every front possible that's just marketing.
202000	210000	So, I'm really, I guess, indifferent towards the whole thing. Yeah, I may not care about what is that show with what's-her-face.
210000	220000	Keira Sedgwick. But the only good thing I saw her in was singles anyway. But I just, I'm totally indifferent.
220000	227000	It's marketing. It's the world we live in today. If people don't like it, go to the bathroom. Take that as your pee break.
227000	233000	Since, you know, even though we are a video game show, we get into nerdy topics. And I know you have a love for the X-Men.
233000	237000	So, I'm sure this was an important movie for you. What did you think of the X-Men movie?
237000	239000	I liked the first 15 minutes of it.
239000	246000	That part was great because it was all about Wade not shutting up without spoiling anything.
246000	249000	Now, the listeners should know you're a total Deadpool fan girl.
249000	250000	I am a total Deadpool fan girl.
250000	255000	So, this was very important, the treatment that he received in the movie. Yes, I'm very, I'm sure you love the end.
255000	258000	Depending on which ending.
258000	262000	The actual end and not the end after the end.
262000	269000	The bonus end, okay, if you watch off to the credits, there's one of two endings. And I got the more lame one.
269000	273000	And I got to see the other one on YouTube before it got pulled off.
273000	278000	And I wish I'd had that one because it made me a lot happier and had some fourth wall breakage.
278000	280000	We don't want to give spoilers, though.
280000	281000	I'm not saying anything.
281000	284000	I know. They're just doing that so they can whore that character out for another horrible movie.
284000	286000	That's more warning Loki than you.
286000	293000	No, because they are, I've been reading several interviews and articles where they're leaving it open for a Deadpool movie.
293000	297000	Which would make me happy if they do it freakin' right.
297000	301000	Question from chat, and a comment from chat. I like old people in chat, which by the way, I still love that name.
301000	304000	It says, X-Men applies to games because there is a game of it.
304000	306000	Actually, there's been several games about the X-Men.
306000	313000	I remember an old school one on the PC, like back in the early 90s, where you were trying to rescue Storm.
313000	316000	I don't even remember what the game, I think it was just X-Men or whatever.
316000	319000	But yeah, X-Men and games have always been kind of tied together a little bit. There's always those tie-ins.
319000	323000	But, um, DJ Rama S asks, how well did Ryan Reynolds play Deadpool?
323000	328000	Keep in mind, he wasn't playing Deadpool in the beginning of the movie. He was playing Wade.
328000	332000	And he, I thought that was pretty, pretty darn right.
332000	335000	Because he did not shut up.
335000	337000	And it was perfect.
337000	340000	I was totally, totally down with that.
340000	343000	I thought that he did an excellent performance on top of that.
343000	347000	Even if you watch any of the interviews with him, he's totally a fan, so it was pretty cool.
347000	348000	I thought he was pretty good too.
348000	350000	And yes, I actually saw the Wolverine movie.
350000	356000	I hardly ever go to movies the weekend they open, but it worked out that I went this weekend and had a good time.
356000	359000	So, I enjoyed the movie more than the last X-Men movie they had.
359000	362000	The last X-Men movie was crap.
362000	364000	It was pure and utter ass.
364000	366000	It wasn't even ass, it was sphincter.
366000	370000	They also had a good amount of fanboy wank in the movie, which I enjoyed.
370000	374000	They threw the fanboys some bones, like having Emma Frost in it, you know.
374000	377000	But she's not really, I don't want to spoil it, God.
377000	379000	I know, I know, I know.
379000	380000	But they tipped the hat.
380000	382000	They had nothing to do with each other, you know what I'm talking about.
382000	383000	I know, I know.
383000	385000	They tipped the hat, is what I'm saying.
385000	389000	And then Gambit, I mean, hello, I was a little worried about how they were going to portray Gambit.
389000	393000	But, you know, he showed up and was like, hi, I'm Gambit, I'm going to be awesome now.
393000	401000	What I was actually most pleased with about him is that they actually got, his accent is legitimate.
401000	404000	It's not one of those overdone, fake Cajun accents.
404000	408000	It sounds pretty right for the area, so I was pretty pleased with that.
408000	414000	ActDeaf is in our chat room and says, I couldn't see the movie since theaters are closed in Mexico.
414000	419000	Because he lives in Mexico and you know how, you know, swine flu is all the rage down there.
419000	421000	As it is starting to be up here too.
421000	423000	They're closing all the movie theaters.
423000	429000	Ray Iannami said sign flu and I'm certainly thinking cosign flu next.
429000	431000	Alright, let's get into more video games.
431000	434000	Loki, did you play anything this week?
434000	436000	Yes, I did.
436000	445000	I played some DS stuff while I was sitting in an apartment with my wife's grandparents who don't speak English.
445000	448000	And there's everyone yelling back and forth in Russian.
448000	453000	And on TV they had a telenovela, which was in Spanish, but dubbed over in Russian.
453000	457000	So it was like double not understanding anything.
457000	460000	So it was awesome.
460000	463000	I like that double not understanding anything.
463000	465000	Zero plus zero equals zero.
465000	467000	Exactly.
467000	473000	But if you're a fan of like the soup and stuff, you may remember how they, I forget which soap opera it is,
473000	479000	but the guy that yells, Rick! I kept doing that because there was a guy that kept talking and that was funny.
479000	480000	Keep me entertained.
480000	484000	Anyways, actual games. I played more of the great Giana Sisters DS game.
484000	486000	How is that? I need to check that out.
486000	488000	It's a basic DS game.
488000	492000	It's just, you know, very much a rip off of Super Mario Brothers.
492000	498000	But that's what made the old school one on the Commodore 64 so awesome was that it was such a rip off of Mario Brothers.
498000	500000	How's the music?
500000	503000	I love the soundtrack to the Giana Sisters.
503000	513000	It's okay. It's not, I mean, I didn't notice any old remakes or whatever, but maybe there were, I mean, I never really played the original.
513000	522000	But it's funny though, I like how she gets the red orb or whatever and becomes emo Giana or whatever and just starts throwing fire that way.
522000	527000	It's like, oh look, I went to Hot Topic. Now I'm going to kick ass.
527000	528000	So that was okay.
528000	534000	I played a little bit more Rhythm Heaven but I still can't stand that game because it's not forgiving at all.
534000	540000	I mean, just, I'm trying to get gold on stuff and it's just not even worth it.
540000	545000	And there's another, like the second set of puzzles that I have that can't do it at all.
545000	546000	So I gave up on that.
546000	553000	I tried Gardening Mama and wow, that game sucks really bad.
553000	555000	Why? What's terrible about it?
555000	559000	I don't know. It's just not the same as Cooking Mama. It doesn't have that same charm to it.
559000	561000	Does it feel like a copy of a copy?
561000	564000	It feels like a copy of a copy and it's also confusing.
564000	567000	They don't really tell you what you're supposed to be doing a lot of times.
567000	571000	I'm like, it's not like, you know, where it's like chop and you kind of get what you're supposed to do.
571000	574000	This I couldn't figure it out so it was annoying.
574000	585000	And then I played a lot more Grand Theft Auto 4 and more on my PC because I'm trying to, my plan is I'm going to mod the rest of our systems.
585000	589000	And we're going to create custom weapons so we can play against each other.
589000	591000	And so I'm trying to develop what weapons they are.
591000	598000	I'm trying to make a flamethrower and I kind of got one sort of made out of like a sniper rifle and some like fire effect thing.
598000	603000	And it works pretty good except sometimes you can catch yourself on fire which is kind of annoying.
603000	604000	Well now that's no fun.
604000	612000	And then another one like a hurricane bomb or something where you throw it down and it just throws everything around but it can kill yourself also pretty violently sometimes.
612000	615000	So just kind of messing with that.
615000	618000	And then what else?
618000	631000	Oh I tried playing Bionic Commando but the problem is at our work our internet's like, even though we're on a T1, it's like split 200 ways and it's slow as hell and I couldn't connect any games.
631000	636000	So that was very disappointing and fortunately this weekend being so busy I didn't get a chance to actually play that.
636000	640000	But I do want to play that because that game looks awesome.
640000	643000	So yeah that's pretty much it for this week.
643000	650000	And I think I may have played a little bit more Excitebots somewhere in there because I finally unlocked the Super Excite.
650000	654000	So I'm actually going to be playing through that tonight which apparently is very unforgiving.
654000	657000	Even more so than the first game.
657000	663000	Yeah and Excitebots is here in studio tonight. So the wife finally let it go for her.
663000	664000	She gave up on it actually.
664000	665000	Oh my gosh really?
665000	667000	Yeah she said it was too hard.
667000	672000	By the way if you've never listened to the show before, something you should know about Loki's wife, she really doesn't play a lot of games.
672000	676000	But there will be that occasional game she gets obsessed with and Excitebots is one of them.
676000	689000	Excitetruck was really the one that she was really looking forward to and she still had fun with it but she's gotten to a kind of a wall right now where she can't S rank these Super Excite ones.
689000	694000	And I mean it's really hard. You have to get even more points than you did in the first time.
694000	702000	And the first time in just a normal Excite race, I mean getting S sometimes requires you to play a track like 20 times if not more than that.
702000	708000	And now you have to get even more than what you got before. It's just like you want to pull your hair out.
708000	716000	And then you get mirror mode which is even harder. And that's always fun. But you unlock more bots.
716000	718000	I saw the hand.
718000	721000	Yes there's a hand that tries to smack you for some reason.
721000	723000	It's the Smash Brothers hand.
723000	729000	I guess it's Master Hand but it's a hand that tries to smash you. I don't know. For no apparent reason whatsoever.
729000	734000	I do kind of want to check this game out. I know we don't have any guests to play it on Justin TV tonight.
734000	738000	But hopefully we'll have in between stories and be able to play some.
738000	746000	I also played a 101 in 1 retro game. I forget what it's called. It's an Atlas collection of mini games.
746000	753000	That sucked too. Because apparently you start off with like 10 games and you have to play through all of them.
753000	759000	And they don't control very well. And you have to score so many points before you can unlock another game.
759000	763000	And I can't because it doesn't control very well and it's annoying.
763000	764000	Dope.
764000	765000	That's alright.
765000	766000	Alright.
766000	767000	That's it.
767000	769000	Well let's see my game.
769000	775000	But I did want to mention something else we played. Which I don't remember exactly the title of the game.
775000	780000	I thought it was something like, was it Eat Poop Cat or something like that?
780000	786000	Oh yeah. The one I eat. Yeah. I remember. It had a very weird name.
786000	789000	Eat Something Cat Poop or something like that was the name of the game.
789000	790000	Yeah.
790000	796000	And basically it's kind of like a drawing version of Telephone. And it was awesome.
796000	799000	And isn't it just like the game LoL on the Nintendo DS?
799000	801000	Yeah. That's what it is. Yeah. Basically.
801000	805000	And just to explain this, guys. So you don't think we're crazy with the title or whatever.
805000	811000	It's basically a game where you write a caption, then you pass the paper to the left, and somebody draws a picture of the caption.
811000	814000	Then you fold the piece of paper over so the caption is hidden.
814000	818000	And then you pass it again. The next person writes the caption they think goes with the picture.
818000	822000	Then they fold over the picture. And the next person draws a picture to go with the caption.
822000	826000	And so on and so on. I know it sounds stupid as I'm describing it, but it's actually a lot of fun.
826000	830000	Because there's always someone in the group who will turn everything into penis.
830000	832000	No matter, you know, what you do.
832000	834000	That person was Rice Princess.
834000	837000	Yes. Truth.
837000	840000	Alright. Anyhow.
840000	843000	Other games. Let's see. My gaming week. Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.
843000	846000	I still had the old standby old stuff.
846000	849000	Especially a lot of classic gaming on the Nintendo Wii this week.
849000	853000	Going into my archive of Zelda and Kid Icarus and all the old school stuff.
853000	856000	Not a lot of new stuff for me this week.
856000	859000	I don't think there's been a lot of new stuff that's been out recently that's kind of caught my attention.
859000	864000	So I am excited though about some of the Xbox Live Arcade releases coming up at least this coming week.
864000	868000	That I'm hoping to try out before I head off this weekend to Anime Central.
868000	871000	So speaking of which.
871000	873000	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
873000	875000	I wanted to talk about and give a little reminder.
875000	879000	I am going to be at Anime Central this weekend in Chicago.
879000	882000	I have a panel on Friday it's called So You Think You Can Podcast.
882000	887000	So if you ever want to hear more about how OLR got started or kind of the story behind it.
887000	890000	Or you want to start your own podcast and you're kind of curious where do I begin?
890000	892000	What kind of mics do I need?
892000	895000	How do I get a listener base or what have you?
895000	899000	I'm going to be doing that panel 4.30 on Friday and I believe it's panel room 7.
899000	901000	But I'm doing that off the top of my head.
901000	904000	Please check the program for the specific location.
904000	908000	I know it's one of the smaller rooms because they're not anticipating there's going to be a big crowd for that.
908000	911000	So let's prove them wrong and make it standing room only.
911000	916000	Also I want to give another thank you to the listeners for the wonderful show computer.
916000	919000	Sadly we're not broadcasting off that tonight.
919000	923000	But I think when we come back in two weeks we're going to be on that show computer.
923000	924000	The new one right?
924000	926000	So we haven't got a chance to actually put it together.
926000	927000	Yeah it just hasn't worked out.
927000	931000	And by the way since of ASEN next week I do not believe there's going to be a show next week.
931000	934000	So next week we will be off.
934000	939000	Unfortunately I don't get back from Chicago until actually it's funny I get back at like 7 o'clock.
939000	944000	So I'm just going to miss you know and that's hoping there's no delays or anything like that.
944000	946000	So sadly we will not be here next week.
946000	948000	But Bobby of course will be here as always.
948000	950000	So give his show a listen.
950000	952000	He'll probably run a little long next week to compensate.
952000	956000	Yeah Bobby was saying that he played Polls Big Adventure on WiiWare.
956000	960000	Which I've been meaning to actually play or install.
960000	963000	But I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.
963000	964000	But that's a pretty awesome game.
964000	967000	That's the one that kind of rips off of all these different old school games.
967000	971000	They have like the castle from Mario Brothers and stuff in it and like weird stuff.
971000	977000	By the way the other good news though about having the show computer is that once we have that that computer will be able to travel.
977000	984000	So that way when I'm gone in the future we'll not hopefully still be able to have a show just without me.
984000	985000	Sniff.
985000	986000	But you know it happens.
986000	988000	We all have our real lives and so on.
988000	989000	Let's see.
989000	994000	Marissa by the way is in chat is jealous of me because I get to visit with the show's resident lesbians at ASEN.
994000	995000	Yes this is true.
995000	998000	I'm hoping to see the lesbians while I'm out there.
998000	1001000	Apparently they hang out in the art room 24-7 is what I hear.
1001000	1003000	So I'm going to definitely stop by there.
1003000	1011000	And I'm hoping I'm going to take my video camera because our Orange Launch Radio YouTube channel is severely neglected.
1011000	1014000	I think the last time we updated it was like two years ago.
1014000	1017000	Well what a perfect opportunity this will be to get some stuff for the YouTube channel.
1017000	1023000	Because for a personal thing I do I've been using YouTube a lot more recently for like a non-gaming thing.
1023000	1025000	So I've learned how to like edit video a lot better and do that stuff.
1025000	1028000	So I'm excited to go to ASEN and actually shoot some video.
1028000	1031000	So I hope our listeners aren't camera shy.
1031000	1033000	Because I will be in your face with a camera.
1033000	1034000	And if so too bad.
1034000	1035000	Yes too bad.
1035000	1038000	Alright so I'm excited.
1038000	1040000	Okay that's really it for housekeeping tonight.
1040000	1043000	Let's get into some video game news.
1043000	1045000	We have a lot of rumors tonight.
1045000	1047000	Rumors, rumors, rumors.
1047000	1052000	But aren't rumors fun to talk about and we're going to see if they seem real or not to us.
1052000	1053000	And I think Loki's going to start us off tonight.
1053000	1056000	Yes one rumor that we have came from Engadget.
1056000	1063000	Apparently they have somebody that has captured what they I guess supposedly believe.
1063000	1068000	That is a brand new peripheral from Microsoft for the Xbox 360.
1068000	1073000	Kind of looks like a stretched out webcam or cross between a webcam and the Wii sensor bar.
1073000	1082000	Basically what this device is supposed to be doing is it's actually a motion sensing kind of almost like a camera.
1082000	1087000	It will actually be used to pick up full body movement and sound.
1087000	1093000	And apparently you can use this to capture full body and hand gestures.
1093000	1095000	Controlling games and characters.
1095000	1099000	Fighting games you can punch, kick, dive, jump, whatever.
1099000	1106000	You can also manipulate stuff on the screen by picking it up, pinching it, moving it, that kind of stuff.
1106000	1108000	Video conferencing.
1108000	1113000	They were saying that you can use it in a trivia game over the internet with live images of each person playing.
1113000	1115000	And the buzzing you would clap.
1115000	1122000	Some other stuff including sensor detects when the person is playing.
1122000	1126000	Only the person that's playing the game and not the people that are just watching it.
1126000	1133000	But I do believe they showed this off the company behind it during CES this year.
1133000	1142000	And it looked interesting. It's basically, I don't know, they were using it actually just a normal webcam.
1142000	1145000	And they had a boxing game and they were showing some guy doing that.
1145000	1149000	It almost looked like an iToy boxing game because you could see the guy in the background and stuff.
1149000	1151000	They have like a flight sim game and stuff.
1151000	1158000	So basically the same kind of applications you would use like an iToy for this would be used for.
1158000	1160000	But the iToy sucked.
1160000	1165000	Yes, but technology is getting better. Just like the PlayStation Eye is a lot better than the original iToy.
1165000	1168000	Okay, first off, real or bullshit? What do you think?
1168000	1172000	There's an image of it. I would say it's real and this is something that they've already...
1172000	1174000	Oh come on, we live in a day and age of Photoshop.
1174000	1181000	Okay, but they've already teased that, oh we're going to show something off of E3 that's going to revolutionize the way you play games.
1181000	1183000	Or the way you enjoy entertainment.
1183000	1185000	Uh, hello?
1185000	1190000	I was just being devil's advocate. I think it's totally real too because Microsoft rumors are always true.
1190000	1192000	I mean that's the rule of thumb we've learned over the years.
1192000	1195000	There's very rarely been rumors about Microsoft that aren't true.
1195000	1199000	And they're horrible at keeping E3 secrets as we learned last year.
1199000	1200000	Yeah.
1200000	1202000	Dark Sakura, real or bullshit?
1202000	1204000	Yeah, I'd do it for real.
1204000	1207000	Here's the thing though, even though it's real, it's not that new.
1207000	1213000	We already have a camera on the Xbox 360 and when I hear about this I shudder because I think of Totem Ball.
1213000	1218000	Which is that horrible, horrible video camera game they had that they tried to do the full body motion controls with.
1218000	1222000	Come on. I mean, granted technology has gotten a little better but come on, that game was shit.
1222000	1226000	I agree. I agree with you and this technology, they actually bought a company.
1226000	1233000	You know, Microsoft bought a company specifically that made these motion type controls.
1233000	1239000	And I hear that guy, I forget his name, I don't want to say Bobby Lee but I don't think it's Bobby Lee.
1239000	1240000	It's something Lee.
1240000	1248000	Remember the guy who did all those wonderful Wiimote things with the stereoscopic or the head tracking and that kind of stuff?
1248000	1249000	The one who did all those experiments?
1249000	1250000	Oh yeah, the demos and stuff.
1250000	1252000	Yeah, he works for Microsoft now.
1252000	1256000	That is such a Microsoft thing to happen to.
1256000	1257000	Yes.
1257000	1258000	So funny.
1258000	1261000	So I would not be surprised if this is at E3.
1261000	1266000	This makes sense because, I mean, and we're going to get into a little bit more later on with other things.
1266000	1272000	But if you think about it, these companies now are starting to take away what is unique about the Wii.
1272000	1277000	And when you take away the motion sensing from the Wii, what's left?
1277000	1278000	A GameCube.
1278000	1279000	Nintendo franchises.
1279000	1284000	SSJ100Matt in chat says, if at first you don't succeed, buy a company that does it better.
1284000	1287000	Chat.orangelandrader.com if you want to join us in our chat room.
1287000	1289000	Here's the other thing about it.
1289000	1291000	Video conferencing, not new.
1291000	1293000	We already have that on the Xbox 360 with the camera.
1293000	1295000	It's just that nobody bought the camera.
1295000	1298000	Except people who wanted to play Strip Uno.
1298000	1300000	That's the only reason people bought the camera.
1300000	1302000	Remember that game Year in the Movies?
1302000	1304000	Dropped down 20 bucks.
1304000	1305000	Oh yeah, I forgot about that game.
1305000	1307000	So it's 20 bucks with the camera bundled in.
1307000	1309000	That's actually cheaper than buying the camera by itself.
1309000	1311000	Do you think it's because they're unloading the cameras because they're not going to need them anymore?
1311000	1312000	Probably.
1312000	1317000	And, you know, this, I'm assuming it's going to be more than just a single camera.
1317000	1319000	Because obviously that didn't work before.
1319000	1321000	And they have new technology now.
1321000	1327000	We've even seen it before in past E3s. I can remember way back to E3 2005.
1327000	1333000	They were showing off camera technology that was actually put in bounding boxes around people's heads.
1333000	1339000	It was able to track individual people and was able to differentiate who's playing the game and who's not.
1339000	1344000	So, I wouldn't be surprised if we see this.
1344000	1346000	Comments in the chat room.
1346000	1348000	Deathwishing says, I bought the camera for Rainbow Six Vegas.
1348000	1352000	Yeah, you know, there were a lot of little games that would use the camera.
1352000	1357000	You know, like UNO had it and some of the other online Xbox Live games.
1357000	1361000	And then some of the other games, like Burnout Paradise.
1361000	1363000	You could take your driver's license picture with the camera.
1363000	1364000	Ooh-ah.
1364000	1372000	Well, every time you knock someone into a wall, you can do a little bit like, yeah, bitch.
1372000	1374000	Stuff like that. Little silly things like that.
1374000	1380000	Or making your own icon, which before we had the official OLR icon on Xbox Live Marketplace,
1380000	1384000	you could kind of make a ghetto one with the Xbox Live camera.
1384000	1389000	In fact, I think Bobby did that for a long time before he had his show's logo on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1389000	1392000	I think he somehow took a picture with his camera.
1392000	1396000	I could be getting that confused with the little big planet level, though.
1396000	1400000	Anyway, I also want to say some other comments from chat here.
1400000	1405000	Black Wolf, of all people, actually says, you're in the movies, doesn't work too well, sadly.
1405000	1406000	I can't get the right lighting.
1406000	1410000	That's always a pain in the ass with these camera setups, too, is the lighting.
1410000	1413000	If it's not just right, the game works terribly.
1413000	1417000	Like, I had a couple of those iToy games on PlayStation 2, and they work like crap.
1417000	1420000	You know what I mean? Like, you have to have the exact right lighting.
1420000	1425000	Well, I'm hoping that this stuff that comes out for whatever this camera or peripheral is going to be,
1425000	1431000	it's hopefully going to be a little bit better than the current camera out there.
1431000	1433000	You know, I've been a sucker.
1433000	1441000	I've bought all three cameras, both the PlayStation iToy and the Vision camera and the PlayStation Eye.
1441000	1443000	Granted, I haven't really used the PlayStation Eye.
1443000	1448000	I meant to use it when I was going to make all these little big planet levels, which I never did.
1448000	1456000	And, you know, the iToy or the Vision camera was... I don't even remember what the hell I bought the Vision camera for.
1456000	1458000	Just the habit, I think.
1458000	1467000	And, man, I can tell you at least with... I haven't tried the PlayStation Eye too much, but the other two, disappointment.
1467000	1471000	Except we did get a good webcam out of the iToy Play.
1471000	1473000	Back in the day.
1473000	1474000	So that kind of worked out.
1474000	1479000	Remember when iToy Chat was going to be the next big thing on the PlayStation 2?
1479000	1481000	Whatever happened to that?
1481000	1483000	Yeah. I don't know.
1483000	1486000	But, yeah, the PlayStation Eye, though, they're definitely doing a lot of things with it.
1486000	1490000	I mean, like, they have that, you know, eye... Was it a pet thing that's coming out?
1490000	1497000	And, you know, the other concept games that they've made, you know, where they can capture images and stuff that people draw.
1497000	1499000	I wish they would actually...
1499000	1500000	Look at that eye of crap.
1500000	1502000	I wish they would actually implement, you know, that.
1502000	1505000	Well, this wasn't the eye adjustment stuff, because scanning cards is retarded.
1505000	1507000	That's been around forever, you know.
1507000	1509000	Hell, there's the e-reader on the Game Boy Advance.
1509000	1517000	I'm talking about actually, you know, something unique where you can actually, you know, draw the tanks and stuff like that.
1517000	1518000	That's kind of cool.
1518000	1523000	But they never released it, because it was just a little demo that they made.
1523000	1525000	All right. Well, guess what?
1525000	1529000	This rumor about motion controllers does not stop with Microsoft and the Xbox.
1529000	1533000	Sony, apparently, is working on something as well, which shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, right?
1533000	1540000	You know, Nintendo has been leading in sales, and, you know, the big thing that separates their system from their competitors right now is the motion controls.
1540000	1544000	So, of course, Microsoft and Sony want to find ways to get a piece of the pie.
1544000	1551000	So we hear this at a Microsoft's camp, and out of Sony's camp, there's a rumor, according to this blog, called The Cut Scene, which is related to Variety.
1551000	1553000	So it's not just some Joe Schmo's blog.
1553000	1557000	This is related to Variety, which is a huge magazine in the entertainment industry.
1557000	1562000	Some sources leaked to The Cut Scene blog that Sony is going to be unveiling a new device at E3.
1562000	1566000	It's not quite the same thing, though, that Loki's been describing for Microsoft.
1566000	1567000	It's not a camera.
1567000	1571000	It's something that's going to have pointing in it, apparently.
1571000	1577000	It's basically, they don't know yet if it's going to be the regular controller infused with a pointer, which is a possibility.
1577000	1585000	But this thing that I'm looking at, according to these patents, almost look like, I don't know, it looks like somebody's playing Samba de Amigo with these maraca-type things.
1585000	1589000	Now, they're not actually maracas, but the little pointers look like little devices.
1589000	1594000	But here's the thing, though, is really they're targets that are being used with the PlayStation Eye.
1594000	1595000	Oh, you think?
1595000	1596000	Yeah.
1596000	1603000	So it's not, I mean, it's basically like the reverse of the Wii setup.
1603000	1611000	Instead of actually having the sensor bar just being a couple lights, and then having the receiver be in the actual remote,
1611000	1618000	this is actually using the camera as the receiver, and then the points or whatever of reference are actually on the controller.
1618000	1625000	Well, continuing on the patent here, they actually say, yeah, this small camera will track the movement of multiple LED lights on the controller.
1625000	1634000	So if you use your PlayStation Eye, and maybe they're going to put lights in these controllers or something so that you can actually move them around, they call it a Wiimote in reverse.
1634000	1641000	Well, because it wouldn't be that hard for them. They've already got 6-axis, which does all the tilting and that kind of stuff.
1641000	1646000	Now they really need depth of field and kind of the IR pointing stuff that the Wii has.
1646000	1647000	There you go, they've decided.
1647000	1649000	Well, let me read you this one final quote about this.
1649000	1655000	Quote, because the camera can read different color lights and the shape and angle of each light, it's much more accurate than the Wiimote.
1655000	1663000	It can track precise movements, including along the Z-axis, pushing towards and away from the TV, something the Wii is really bad at, as well as velocity.
1663000	1671000	The fact that it's tracking actual colored lights and not just infrared, yeah, that does make it a little bit better because the Wii can pick up anything that's infrared.
1671000	1677000	And if it mistakes a reflection of something, then it's going to get all messed up.
1677000	1684000	But that, I'm sure, if you're playing near a glass coffee table, like I do, it'll probably still tweak out a little bit.
1684000	1686000	Truth or bullshit?
1686000	1689000	Truth, but I'm not sure if they're announcing it at E3.
1689000	1690000	Interesting.
1690000	1693000	Because they've had a lot of motion sensor patents and stuff.
1693000	1695000	I mean, I could see them doing that.
1695000	1696000	I mean, why not?
1696000	1702000	Because they really don't have the casual sector yet, so, you know, Microsoft's made more of a move towards that.
1702000	1707000	But Sony, not so much, other than karaoke and, you know, trivia games.
1707000	1708000	I'm going to say distorted truth.
1708000	1711000	I don't think it's necessarily, I'm along the lines of what you're saying.
1711000	1717000	I don't think that they're going to launch this whole new controller, this motion controller that you're going to have all this extra crap for your TV.
1717000	1719000	I think they're going to find ways to use the devices they already have.
1719000	1724000	Maybe releasing a new six-axis controller with the lights in it that's going to involve this.
1724000	1727000	So I would say distorted truth.
1727000	1730000	It's one of those where there's smoke, there's fire type of things.
1730000	1734000	It can even be something even smaller, I mean, because they have a USB port on those controllers.
1734000	1740000	You could literally just plug something into the top of the controller and run it off the power for the controller.
1740000	1741000	Dark Sockroach?
1741000	1745000	I was going to comment, you know, if you want to turn that phrase around, where there's smoke, they could be on something.
1745000	1749000	That's true too, but I want to ask you, truth or bullshit?
1754000	1755000	I really don't know.
1755000	1760000	Every Sony rumor has been true, so let's just go with true on this, because seriously, every time they're like,
1760000	1763000	no, that's not really happening, we have no plans for that, what are you talking about?
1763000	1767000	And then it's like, oh, hey, look, price drop in PlayStation 2.
1767000	1769000	That totally surprised you.
1769000	1774000	But wait, how many times have there been rumors that the PlayStation 3 price is going to drop or be redesigned?
1774000	1775000	That never happens.
1775000	1776000	I don't think that's rumors.
1776000	1778000	I think it's wishful thinking.
1778000	1785000	A lot of those rumors, though, are coming from people thinking, okay, Microsoft's dropping their price or, you know, this is coming out.
1785000	1787000	They've got to drop it in order to be competitive.
1787000	1792000	Well, they don't care, so there's no price drop.
1792000	1793000	Just consider the source.
1793000	1794000	But it's going to happen.
1794000	1795000	All right.
1795000	1801000	So knowing that Microsoft and Sony, one way or another, we all pretty much agree, except Dark Sockroach is not sure,
1801000	1805000	but we all pretty much agree they are making movements to go towards motion control.
1805000	1806000	We at least all agree that Microsoft's going to do it.
1806000	1807000	Well, let me put it this way.
1807000	1812000	If one of them does it, it's either Sony or Microsoft, the other one's pretty much going to have to do it.
1812000	1813000	Of course Microsoft's going to do it.
1813000	1817000	Microsoft has made their machine out of ripping off good ideas and doing it well.
1817000	1819000	That's not a slam on Microsoft.
1819000	1821000	They do a great job of ripping off good ideas.
1821000	1822000	You know what I mean?
1822000	1823000	And making them better.
1823000	1826000	Anyway, here's what I want to ask.
1826000	1828000	Should Nintendo be worried?
1828000	1829000	Yes.
1829000	1833000	Because really, everyone's looking at innovative motion controls.
1833000	1837000	That's what they pride themselves on, these games.
1837000	1839000	And granted, they have franchises and stuff.
1839000	1840000	Don't get me wrong.
1840000	1841000	Mario Kart's awesome.
1841000	1843000	Mario Galaxy's cool.
1843000	1845000	Zelda's really nice.
1845000	1850000	But when you look at it, though, and especially with Microsoft, the price point,
1850000	1855000	if they start coming out with a Tiger Woods game that's motion sensitive on the 360, it looks better.
1855000	1856000	It may be slightly more expensive.
1856000	1863000	And a motion controlled game on the Wii, now it's not the only option for motion controlled stuff.
1863000	1865000	You can get it on both platforms.
1865000	1870000	And now that's a problem because a lot of people just pick up Tiger Woods game on the Wii,
1870000	1876000	even if they own both because they want that extra kind of immersion for it.
1876000	1881000	But now you can take those awesome Red Steel or something like that, or Matterworld,
1881000	1884000	that looks awesome but is kind of limited by the hardware.
1884000	1888000	Now you've got more powerful hardware and the motion controls.
1888000	1890000	That's going to be some really awesome games.
1890000	1895000	And unfortunately, Nintendo, I can't see them doing anything very innovative at E3.
1895000	1898000	And I bet you anything all their announcements are not going to be innovative
1898000	1900000	and they're just going to be sequels to their franchises,
1900000	1905000	much like a Pikmin 3 or a sequel to Wii Fit.
1905000	1909000	Hell, they have a sequel to basically the Wii Mote coming out with Wii Motion Plus,
1909000	1911000	the fix, something they should have had in the first place,
1911000	1915000	and a sequel to Wii Sports because that's what sells on their system.
1915000	1918000	And funny enough, that's why I disagree with you.
1918000	1920000	I think Nintendo has nothing to worry about.
1920000	1924000	Now, when I first heard this earlier in the week, I had the same reaction you did.
1924000	1926000	I was like, oh, Nintendo's fucked.
1926000	1929000	Now they're going to have this new thing with the motion control.
1929000	1931000	They're taking what makes the Nintendo Wii so great.
1931000	1933000	They're putting it on this new hardware.
1933000	1936000	Nintendo's screwed because everybody's going to want to go to the better looking games.
1936000	1938000	But I thought about it, I thought about it, and I thought, you know what?
1938000	1940000	That's not really going to happen.
1940000	1943000	At the end of the day, Nintendo is still going to have kids and soccer moms.
1943000	1945000	And that's who they've built their audience on.
1945000	1947000	That's how they built their system.
1947000	1948000	That's who's still going to be loyal to them.
1948000	1951000	Remember, people are not buying the Wii for the Wii.
1951000	1954000	They're buying the Wii for Wii Sports.
1954000	1957000	And at the end of the day, Nintendo still has Wii Sports.
1957000	1959000	Will this put a crack in it?
1959000	1965000	Yes. Some of the fanboys and the hardcore, a little crack might be put in Nintendo because of this.
1965000	1968000	But is it enough to shatter Nintendo? Absolutely not.
1968000	1971000	Yeah, they're already too far ahead, but I think it will slow them down.
1971000	1975000	Because now they can't say that they have all this innovative control stuff.
1975000	1978000	Now they actually have to think on their feet and come up with something new.
1978000	1982000	I mean, that's really, I think, what they should be doing, is coming up with something new.
1982000	1988000	Because now they've caught up to, you know, you can only be really innovative so long.
1988000	1990000	Now people have caught up to what you had.
1990000	1994000	Just like with Rumble and stuff, people started implementing Rumble, now everybody has it.
1994000	1997000	It's like, you've got to come up with the next big thing.
1997000	2003000	And here's the thing. Also, keep in mind, the motion is built into the Wii.
2003000	2007000	It is a part of every Wii game because it is what makes the Wii.
2007000	2010000	I mean, besides maybe a couple games here and there that decide to ignore it.
2010000	2013000	But you know what I mean. It is integrated into the Wii.
2013000	2015000	You know, the motion control is the Wii.
2015000	2017000	With the Xbox 360, this is something extra.
2017000	2021000	This is not something that they're putting in, that was not already in the system by default.
2021000	2023000	So you're going to have to buy this extra peripheral device.
2023000	2026000	Unless they start including it with the system.
2026000	2028000	They still have millions of units out there without.
2028000	2031000	And do you think game developers are just going to ignore those masses?
2031000	2035000	They can just bundle it with a game that's like, you know, something that everybody wants.
2035000	2040000	But look at the history of peripherals. Very, very few do well.
2040000	2045000	Most tank. Power Glove, U-Force, Power Pad.
2045000	2049000	Video cameras, which we were just talking about, the vision cameras.
2049000	2052000	Yeah, but I think they would have done a lot better if they were bundled in with games.
2052000	2054000	Look at what Nintendo's doing now. Wii Fit.
2054000	2058000	They want to sell a lot of balance boards, so what they did, they included the software free.
2058000	2063000	They wanted to sell a lot of, you know, remotes and stuff like that, so they included a game for ten bucks more.
2063000	2069000	I do want to say before somebody in chat screams their head off, some peripherals do break the mold and do well.
2069000	2073000	Guitar and drum and DR have all shattered.
2073000	2074000	The Wii Wheel.
2074000	2079000	You'd be surprised how freaking popular that is for a piece of plastic.
2079000	2080000	I mean, I don't...
2080000	2083000	But for the Wii Wheel, we had a Lynx Crossbow.
2083000	2084000	Here's the problem, though.
2084000	2090000	Okay, and I understand, you know, Lynx Crossbow training, well, with the Wii Zapper, that sucked.
2090000	2092000	And yeah, the Wii Zapper is a horrible peripheral.
2092000	2095000	The thing is, here's the problem that Microsoft has.
2095000	2100000	All the people, though, that wanted, you know, the Wii, you know, for Wii Sports and that kind of stuff,
2100000	2103000	they're going to buy the Wii because it's cheap, you know, or cheaper.
2103000	2112000	But now, you know, with Microsoft and stuff, actually, if they can come out with some sort of way to bundle in like a sports game in this motion sensor,
2112000	2113000	they might be able to pull it off.
2113000	2116000	But they're going to have to have a must-have game with this.
2116000	2119000	Because if they try to pack in totem ball, don't fucking bother.
2119000	2123000	Like, seriously, don't fucking bother, Microsoft, if you're going to put in a game of that quality.
2123000	2127000	Like, they're going to have to put in a must-have game.
2127000	2133000	And they got to be careful if they're going to try to be competitive with the Wii Sports thing, you know what I mean?
2133000	2136000	They're going to need to have the must-have game with this in order to sell this thing.
2136000	2142000	I mean, that's how Guitar Hero and all that, those peripherals did well, is because they came with must-have games.
2142000	2145000	Link's crossbow training, not so much a must-have game.
2145000	2150000	DDR, pop culture icon of the late 90s, early 2000s, you know what I mean?
2150000	2154000	It's, you know, the DDR pads did fairly well because of that.
2154000	2158000	Yeah, and it also depends, you know, Microsoft's going after the core gamer.
2158000	2161000	They're trying to get into more of the casual game market.
2161000	2167000	Nintendo not so much anymore with the core game where they just want to bring on new people that haven't played games, which is sad.
2167000	2169000	I don't know, we'll see out of E3.
2169000	2174000	I'm sure it's going to be exciting either way, but, you know, they have to do it right, the games have to be good.
2174000	2176000	You know, because you're right, Total Ball sucks.
2176000	2179000	HungryMister in chat says Halo 4.
2179000	2182000	I mean, that would be going for the juggler, but I just don't see that as being...
2182000	2187000	Like, I don't know, when I see myself in the game, Halo's not really the type of game I want to be doing the most.
2187000	2190000	I don't think they're going to overshadow Halo ODST right now.
2190000	2193000	I mean, that's more of an announcement for, like, next year.
2193000	2199000	And they need something more than Halo, because Halo's not going to bring in the casual gamer.
2199000	2203000	And to be fair, GameGuru said the same thing and said, that's the game you need to put the X mode in.
2203000	2211000	I just, you know, I just think it would be if Halo 4 supports it, it'll help drive it, but I just don't think, you know,
2211000	2215000	I think they're going to turn off a lot of their Halo, because there's some people that don't want this.
2215000	2218000	There's some people that are going to, you know, and that's what turns some people off to the Wii.
2218000	2221000	They don't want to be up around flailing their arms about and all this stuff.
2221000	2223000	You know, there's some gamers that don't want to do that.
2223000	2229000	And I bet a lot of the Halo fans don't really want to get out of their seat and run around like a maniac to kill people in Halo.
2229000	2232000	You know, they want to sit there with a controller and do it that way.
2232000	2234000	So I think it would actually be a mistake.
2234000	2236000	Enhance Halo 4 with this? Maybe.
2236000	2238000	Mandatory? Probably not.
2238000	2239000	Alright, anyhow.
2239000	2242000	I like to run and fill about and kill people.
2242000	2247000	Well, then you're one of the folks that maybe would benefit from that, but I'm just saying the majority of Halo folks.
2247000	2249000	The majority of Halo folks would not like it.
2249000	2254000	So I don't know. What type of game would you like? Is there any type of game you think could be successful with this?
2254000	2257000	I think the fitness bandwagon is where it's at.
2257000	2262000	I agree with that, but I was also sort of thinking about a revival of, like, Marvel Madness maze games.
2262000	2265000	Where you control it with your hand.
2265000	2268000	You know, that type of thing. I think that would be actually pretty fun.
2268000	2277000	Or, if I was going to do a game and nobody steal my idea, I would actually do recess games.
2277000	2280000	Where you could have Virtual Red Rover and Simon Says.
2280000	2282000	EA Playground did it first.
2282000	2284000	Okay, whatever.
2284000	2286000	I like that idea, though.
2286000	2290000	That's kind of like Wii Sports, but different. I like that idea.
2290000	2293000	EA is giving me Sims 3, so I'm happy.
2293000	2297000	Alright, anyhow. Let's move on with some more news. I'm sure we will get calls on this later in the show.
2297000	2300000	We will take your calls later in the show. 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2300000	2302000	But not right now. We want to get through the rest of the news first.
2302000	2304000	We have more rumors, right DarkSakura?
2304000	2315000	Well, the people that leaked the Forza 3 rumor have also sent in an image showing that there's going to be perfect dark on Xbox Live Arcade.
2315000	2321000	And so, it could possibly be it has the same thumbnail image that Rare leaked in April.
2321000	2328000	Okay, I was just watching what Loki was doing with the controller.
2328000	2331000	Loki's playing on Excitebots right now, so it's a little bit distracting.
2331000	2333000	It looks a little perversion.
2333000	2337000	It looks like you're driving the Batmobile or something. This is an interesting car.
2337000	2341000	It is an actual bat he's driving. This game looks kind of fun, actually.
2341000	2355000	As I was saying, the thought overall is that there could be more rare Nintendo 64 titles coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but there's not really enough to support it yet.
2355000	2358000	We have to wait and see.
2358000	2366000	I know there's a lot of perfect dark fanboys, and certainly I did not like that new one they had on Xbox 360, like their launch title at all.
2366000	2370000	So, you know, going back to the classics, I think it would be a lot better.
2370000	2381000	No, it's also funny. They also had Bean listed on there, which I don't remember if that was a codename for either the original Perfect Dark Zero, or if it's a sequel to Perfect Dark Zero.
2381000	2383000	That was also listed on there, which is kind of funny.
2383000	2389000	And then, of course, as Jamie mentioned, Forza 3. They once again teased Forza 3.
2389000	2398000	They actually had the logo kind of, I don't know, poorly airbrushed over, but people could tell what it was.
2398000	2410000	So, obviously, I mean, kind of going back to, hell, that old ass survey that leaked out all the information about Forza 3, you can better believe that it's going to be at E3 this year.
2410000	2412000	Of course, it's going to be big.
2412000	2422000	And it's going to be funny, too, because Gran Turismo 5 still hasn't come out yet, and I don't know. I wonder when that's going to come out.
2422000	2430000	But, of course, no details on it yet, other than, you know, Forza 3, kind of the logo is being shown there. You can tell it's Forza.
2430000	2439000	Hmm. Forza, not a racing series I particularly get into. It's a little heavy for me, but I guess there's a lot of fans of Forza, certainly.
2439000	2443000	So, I know there will be a lot of folks that are all about this at E3 this year.
2443000	2447000	Well, we have other big, big rumors, and this one has to do with portable gaming.
2447000	2455000	And, yes, it involves the PSP, and apparently the rumor has leaked out about the new PSP that's going to be shown at E3 this year.
2455000	2457000	It's called the PSP Go.
2457000	2463000	Apparently the rumors are starting to snowball with this, and it's due to some 1UP reporting from earlier this week.
2463000	2468000	According to some inside sources, apparently it's going to be getting a complete hardware redesign.
2468000	2474000	It kind of, it looks to me like a cell phone with one of those screens that pops out like a sidekick.
2474000	2480000	Like, that's what this little machine, I don't think it's supposed to be like that, but the way this thing looks is it looks like a sidekick to me,
2480000	2485000	where the screen kind of pops out, and then you have the controller underneath it.
2485000	2487000	This is the silliest thing I've ever seen in my life.
2487000	2493000	It's interesting, isn't it? But if it collapses down into like the size of a little cell phone, I can kind of see that.
2493000	2494000	It's still silly.
2494000	2497000	I don't know. Yeah, it's kind of one of those things I'd have to see.
2497000	2501000	Apparently it's going to have two different flavors, 8 gigabyte flavor and 16 gigabyte flavor.
2501000	2508000	That's right, internal memory built in, although there's other rumors around that there may have some actual like tiny, tiny memory sticks that go with this.
2508000	2511000	But here's the thing that makes this system so different.
2511000	2513000	No UMD.
2513000	2519000	It's going to be, and meaning no disks, so meaning that the game will be entirely fueled,
2519000	2524000	and this is where the rumor's been going for a while now that there's going to be this PSP2 that's fueled this way,
2524000	2528000	that this PSP Go is going to be fueled entirely off downloadable titles.
2528000	2535000	In fact, over 100 classic and new PSP titles, they are saying, available at the system's launch.
2535000	2538000	One of the biggies, Gran Turismo Mobile.
2538000	2544000	I hope for their sake they're not doing this move in hopes that it's going to cut down on their piracy,
2544000	2549000	because I'll have them know all the PlayStation Network titles that they have available.
2549000	2550000	They're only for download only.
2550000	2553000	Those have already leaked out, and they've leaked out just as fast.
2553000	2562000	So they better hopefully fix whatever ways people have of exploiting their system and putting custom firmwares on,
2562000	2565000	because if they don't, this is going to be completely useless.
2565000	2567000	Although, at the same time, it looks neat.
2567000	2572000	I know. I've got to say, I kind of disagree with Dark Soccer when she says it looks silly.
2572000	2575000	I'm kind of interested in this. I don't know why.
2575000	2579000	I already have a PSP, but I really like the idea of the fact that it's small.
2579000	2585000	I won't have to worry about disks, because the system is going to be built in to play all these games.
2585000	2586000	I don't worry about disks already.
2586000	2587000	Shut up.
2587000	2588000	But you know what I mean.
2588000	2593000	Me, the legal player, doesn't have to worry about this kind of...
2593000	2595000	If they have a good interface with the PC...
2595000	2599000	Well, I have a PlayStation 3, so it's not going to matter, because you know it will interface with that.
2599000	2602000	But if they have a good interface with the PC, I kind of think this might be kind of cool.
2602000	2608000	Well, right now they have the firmwares that are already up there where you can actually browse the PlayStation Store on the PSP.
2608000	2612000	So, you know, it's just as easy as the PS3.
2612000	2619000	What's interesting about this, you're not talking about a hardware upgrade with this, which is what I find really interesting about this.
2619000	2621000	It's not a PSP2.
2621000	2628000	That's where I'm kind of like, huh, at what Sony's doing here, because they're not taking this opportunity to upgrade the hardware at all.
2628000	2633000	And I don't really see the point of needing to hide the controls in there.
2633000	2637000	I mean, really, is there any reason why you need a sliding screen, unless the screen is going to be touchscreen or something like that?
2637000	2644000	Because it's a look thing, so if I put a little protector on the screen, I can carry it around in my pocket and not have to worry about breaking the buttons.
2644000	2646000	It's just like a cellphone.
2646000	2647000	Yeah, the buttons don't break, though.
2647000	2648000	You can seal the keyboard underneath the screen.
2648000	2651000	I don't know, unless they're making the screen bigger, which would be nice.
2651000	2654000	And I heard that was part of the rumor, that the screen was going to be bigger.
2654000	2664000	And they're talking about some other PDA system that they have right now that's like some weird resolution, but they're maybe 720x480 or something, what they're going for.
2664000	2670000	I don't know, we'll have to see. I'm sure if they're going to announce it, they're going to announce it at E3.
2670000	2676000	Although, I kind of find it funny that they've already revised their system like three times already, so...
2676000	2678000	They're just trying to find the perfect fit.
2678000	2682000	Let's read some comments from chat. This is stirring a huge response in chat right now.
2682000	2684000	chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment.
2684000	2690000	Goldanthro in chat says, no UMD is fucking retarded, and the downloadable titles will probably be DRM to hell.
2690000	2696000	Deathwishing says, I like owning cases, that sucks. HungryMister says, oh shit, this is amazing.
2696000	2701000	TheRobD says, yeah, that's interesting stuff, it might be a good idea, I don't know if storage can support it though.
2701000	2707000	That's kind of true too, is that when you're talking about how many games are going to fit on 8GB.
2707000	2710000	The largest UMD game is 2GB.
2710000	2712000	So, that you're talking like maybe...
2712000	2714000	But most of them are not 2GB.
2714000	2721000	Okay, so maybe seven games. So, there better be an easy ass way for me to move games on and off this thing.
2721000	2725000	Like an iTunes-ish thing to manage my system.
2725000	2730000	That's the problem though, is if you don't have high speed internet, even still if you have high speed internet,
2730000	2732000	downloading a 2GB game is going to take a long time.
2732000	2738000	And all these caps now too, with like Comcast and all this says 250GB and so on, that could be dangerous, right?
2738000	2744000	Well, I don't know if they're really worried about used game sales because their games don't sell that much anyways.
2744000	2746000	So, I don't really see that impacting stuff.
2746000	2752000	But, I don't know, if it's all digital, it's just going to make it a little bit cheaper for them.
2752000	2754000	Let me get some other comments from chat real quick.
2754000	2758000	Tiger Claw says, I prefer owning a physical copy of the game rather than a digital version.
2758000	2761000	Brad from Pod Culture says, not a fan of the no UMD deal though.
2761000	2763000	I think it looks kind of neat too.
2763000	2770000	Make the switch and do something like Nintendo. Put the game on a chip. A slot wouldn't take up near the space that UMD would.
2770000	2778000	But, at the same time, this is not going to really sell to people that say, for example, own a bunch of PSP games already,
2778000	2780000	because now they've got to replace them all or buy them again.
2780000	2783000	And really, do you think people are going to buy their games again?
2783000	2786000	I mean, that's wishful thinking, Sony, if that's what you think is going to actually happen.
2786000	2796000	Yeah, that's another thing is that if I already own this game on UMD, there better damn well be a way that I can transfer this onto my PSP without having to re-buy the game.
2796000	2798000	That's going to be shitty, if not.
2798000	2801000	And I have a bad feeling that's where we're going.
2801000	2803000	Because how else is it going to know?
2803000	2811000	And there's no other way, unless, I mean, the only thing I can think of maybe as another alternative for this is,
2811000	2814000	you know how they have DVDs now where they have digital copy?
2814000	2820000	Basically, it's a digital version of the movie. Sometimes it's on it, and sometimes you actually download it.
2820000	2824000	Yes, that's how I got Mamma Mia on my phone, when I bought it on Blu-ray with a free copy.
2824000	2829000	Exactly. Well, what if now they're going to have something similar where you buy a UMD game, and then you get digital copy as well?
2829000	2842000	So, for example, if you don't say, I mean, if you have this only download game system that you can use that to play the game,
2842000	2845000	and then maybe give the copy to your friend, I don't know.
2845000	2849000	It doesn't sound like a good idea.
2849000	2857000	Eventually everything will be digital, I'm sure, or maybe head that direction, but kind of making that leap now.
2857000	2861000	And iTunes, I'm sorry, or the iPhone and that kind of stuff, that's a little different.
2861000	2869000	I mean, the App Store, you have a lot of weird stuff on there, useful stuff, not necessarily just games.
2869000	2874000	And I'm sure if they had a way to do standalone games, they'd probably be selling games for it as well,
2874000	2876000	but that's the only means to get stuff on there.
2876000	2882000	And the fact that they're going to try to compete with that is kind of dumb with taking the UMD out of the picture.
2882000	2888000	Hitstun in chat says, Sky, apparently you can go to a store and they'll have a kiosk that will transfer your UMD game to a memory stick.
2888000	2896000	I hope to hell that's true, because if it's not, and I'm going to be forced to rebuy the game I already own on the PSP1, I will turn to piracy.
2896000	2897000	But here's the thing.
2897000	2901000	I mean, I hate to openly admit that on the show, but that's dumb.
2901000	2908000	But that's even more retarded if they're going to do that, because what's going to stop Joe Blow from loaning his game to somebody?
2908000	2915000	I could buy one copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and loan it to 50 people and they can all get it dumped to their, you know...
2915000	2918000	Unless they use a key.
2918000	2920000	But not for old games. Old games don't have that.
2920000	2923000	And each game isn't marked, you can't tell one from another.
2923000	2930000	You know what, though? What about Joe Blow taking this latest CD that he bought at the store and his friend ripping it to his iTunes?
2930000	2933000	You know that happens rampily as it is.
2933000	2937000	I know, but they're trying to figure out ways not to do stuff like that.
2937000	2942000	I mean, granted, we can assume that someone's doing that, but they're making it super easy.
2942000	2949000	It's just like, you know, Rob, I can have you buy a game and then now we all have the game, because you bought the game.
2949000	2950000	Awesome!
2950000	2952000	You know, I like that idea.
2952000	2955000	If it was that easy, here's my question to you.
2955000	2960000	If it was that easy and it was that open, would you steal the game?
2960000	2963000	Yes.
2963000	2965000	Damn you, you're not doing well for my troubles.
2965000	2968000	Because there's nothing easier than not driving to the store and not, you know...
2968000	2970000	No, I mean, seriously...
2970000	2975000	I don't understand you sometimes, because you pay extravagant amounts of money for some games and in other games you're just like, eh, I'll just download it.
2975000	2983000	You know, that's the only reason I sometimes stick up for you, is because I know the disgusting amount of money you do spend on video games at the end of the day.
2983000	2987000	So, I'm somehow strangely okay with the piracy.
2987000	2993000	Let's look at, you know, a lot of the stuff I pirate or download is stuff that I'm trying out.
2993000	2998000	And granted, that's a stupid excuse, yes, but I literally play the game for five minutes and then that's it.
2998000	3000000	I'm done, I don't play it anymore.
3000000	3003000	Perfect example, Gardening Mama.
3003000	3005000	I played that for two minutes today.
3005000	3007000	I will not be playing that game ever again.
3007000	3008000	That game is getting deleted.
3008000	3011000	But I'm glad I didn't buy it, because that game sucks.
3011000	3017000	And yes, I could have rented it, but once again, I have to go to a store, at the finest store, first off, that rents DS games.
3017000	3027000	Go to that store, rent the game for, you know, $7 or whatever, and that still wasted gas, time, and money for something that took me two seconds to download.
3027000	3033000	And, you know, I blame Nintendo for not having demos for their, well, they do have demos for their games, and I guess I could have tried it out online.
3033000	3037000	Big deal, that still takes too long on the Wii, and really, I don't want to do that.
3037000	3040000	But then if a game is good enough, you'll buy it, like a SiteBots.
3040000	3041000	Yes, exactly.
3041000	3043000	SiteBots, I could have pirated that.
3043000	3048000	It was out that same day, it was out early, you know, I could have pirated that, but no, I bought it because it's awesome.
3048000	3052000	And, you know, Grand Theft Auto, I don't have to tell you how many times I've bought that game.
3052000	3058000	I bought it on the PC and five times, actually six times on the 360, and all the expansions I bought six times.
3058000	3060000	So, you know what, Rockstar has my money.
3060000	3068000	Alright, I just wanted to present both sides of it for the people that get, you know, little angry clouds over their heads when you talk about piracy and all this stuff.
3068000	3071000	I want to be fair and present both sides.
3071000	3075000	And, you know, to be honest, the last game I played on my PSP, I don't even remember when.
3075000	3083000	It was so long ago, PSP. The last thing I played on my PSP? Rift Tracks for Twilight, and that was awesome.
3083000	3086000	Alright, that's going to do it for our PSP discussion.
3086000	3089000	If you want to call in about this later, I'm sure we'll get some calls about this a little later on the show.
3089000	3095000	But we want to move on to some release dates and some non-rumors, things we know that are coming out very soon.
3095000	3096000	We'll start off in the UK.
3096000	3098000	Sorry, UK, nothing till the 12th.
3098000	3099000	What a bummer.
3099000	3102000	Must be a slow release week, or a non-release week.
3102000	3106000	I think that everyone's recovering from May 1st being a fertility holiday.
3106000	3109000	Isn't there a bank? Yeah, I was going to say, isn't there a bank holiday?
3109000	3110000	That could be.
3110000	3111000	Maybe.
3111000	3113000	I think it was like on the 7th or something. I don't know.
3113000	3116000	Alright, well then so much for UK releases. How about the US?
3116000	3120000	In the US, there's actually some stuff coming out.
3120000	3126000	This week, actually speaking, it's very ironic that we were just talking about all these digital downloads.
3126000	3134000	Patapon 2, the digital download only, or you can get the little card to redeem it, is actually going to be available on PSP this week.
3134000	3143000	Also this week, we're going to be getting Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, part of the New Play Control re-release series on the Wii.
3143000	3149000	Fantasy Aquarium World looks like shit, so don't buy it. It's on the Wii.
3149000	3150000	Really cheap though.
3150000	3157000	Puzzle Kingdoms, a game from Zoo Games, actually created by the creators of Puzzle Quest, and it's basically a rip-off of Puzzle Quest.
3157000	3160000	But you can get that on the DS this week.
3160000	3169000	Knight of the Museum, Battle for the Smithsonian, that's going to be on Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this week.
3169000	3175000	Also, Jagged Alliance coming to the DS, which, man, that's an old game that they're porting over there.
3175000	3182000	Crysis, the Maximum Edition, I believe that's with Crysis Wars, the original Crysis, and the online multiplayer one.
3182000	3184000	That's going to be available for PC.
3184000	3188000	Destiny of Zorro coming out this week on the Wii.
3188000	3194000	Leisure Suit, Larry Box Office Bust, finally coming out on the PS3.
3194000	3201000	If I need to remind you guys, that got horrible reviews and apparently really sucked, so keep that in mind.
3201000	3208000	And then probably the best one this week, Klonoa coming out on the Wii, which is pretty awesome.
3208000	3213000	The price now? $30 bucks. $30 bucks new. I mean, you can't beat that.
3213000	3219000	And then, of course, you know, to go along with that, you have to have a really crappy game.
3219000	3225000	Imagine Music Fest. Imagine if I cared. That's it.
3225000	3227000	Well, let's head on over to Japan.
3227000	3231000	Actually, I want to start, though, because there's nothing on the Xbox 360 for Japan this week,
3231000	3235000	but there is something coming out in the other Asian regions, specifically China.
3235000	3239000	It's the Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 bundle with a dance mat in China.
3239000	3247000	The reason why I'm highlighting this is because this is a Chinese version with special songs for that region, like Chinese music.
3247000	3251000	So if you're into, you know, you like the Chinese rock and stuff, you might want to check this out,
3251000	3255000	because I do not believe there's ever been a DDR with Chinese music.
3255000	3259000	I know they've had Korean, they've had Japanese, of course, and American, naturally.
3259000	3264000	I don't know if there's been one before with Chinese. That could be the first one, to my knowledge.
3264000	3268000	On the PlayStation 3, nothing this week. It's a very slow week in Japan.
3268000	3272000	It's looking very similar to Europe. Even on the Nintendo Wii, not a thing as well.
3272000	3276000	There's not a release coming up until May 14th when you have a winning 11 game coming out.
3276000	3281000	On the PlayStation 2, nothing this week either. Same thing on the DS.
3281000	3287000	It is a very slow week in Japan right now, so not a darn thing being released except that DDR in other Asian regions.
3287000	3291000	So there you have it. We'll have more to talk about next week, hopefully.
3291000	3293000	So let's get back into some gaming news.
3293000	3304000	Well, there is a little news regarding a particular bit of rock and roll royalty, as in Prince, who is now, again, Prince and not, you know, that weird symbol.
3304000	3311000	That was actually incredibly brilliant on his part, because I won't go into it. Look it up on Wikipedia.
3311000	3314000	But still, he does some serious drugs or something.
3314000	3316000	No, no, no. Well, you know what the whole thing was.
3316000	3320000	No, I know. It's to free himself from his record label and da-da-da, but...
3320000	3322000	I thought that was a smart move and more like...
3322000	3323000	That's why he did the drugs.
3323000	3325000	...kicking, you know, giving them the finger.
3325000	3334000	But anyway, Prince actually turned down a deal to have his songs in Guitar Hero.
3334000	3342000	He has said that he doesn't have a problem with them, but he wants...
3342000	3346000	He thinks it's more important that kids learn to actually play the guitar.
3346000	3352000	To put the effort into it and not have it just basically handed to you.
3352000	3356000	He was quoted as saying, to play music is one of the greatest things.
3356000	3362000	I agree with that, but at the same time, I think Guitar Hero and Rock Band gets people playing the fake guitars...
3362000	3363000	Thank you.
3363000	3364000	...and it gets them interested.
3364000	3368000	Thank you. I'm like, you know, stop being arrogant. I mean, I understand.
3368000	3374000	I know plenty of people who play those games who have zero interest in learning the guitar for real.
3374000	3376000	They want the instant gratification.
3376000	3380000	Well, but it's better than no appreciation for music whatsoever, right? You know what I mean?
3380000	3384000	Like, it's the same thing with Wii Music. Remember, we had this same discussion when Wii Music came out about how,
3384000	3388000	hey, as dumb as this game looks, if it gets kids interested in music, it's a good thing.
3388000	3393000	It's different for, you know, younger kids, which I think Wii Music would more appeal to,
3393000	3401000	than usually the people who are buying Guitar Hero and Rock Band already have an interest in the music they'll be playing.
3401000	3403000	So, I don't...
3403000	3408000	Now, one benefit with all the download content is being introduced to new bands and hearing new things.
3408000	3422000	But at the same time, I really don't think that it's a great introductory medium now for people learning about music.
3422000	3424000	Wii Music, I think, is a completely different animal.
3424000	3429000	I just, you know, I just think it's a darn shame that he feels this way because, you know,
3429000	3433000	When Doves Cry would be, like, the most epic rock band song, in my opinion.
3433000	3436000	It would be fun. I would buy that in a heartbeat.
3436000	3437000	You know what would be better than that?
3437000	3438000	What?
3438000	3439000	Let's Get Crazy.
3439000	3440000	Or 1999.
3440000	3441000	That'd be fun, too.
3441000	3442000	That's more synth.
3442000	3445000	Yeah, but, you know, since we're never gonna get the keyboards, you know, we...
3445000	3446000	Keytar!
3446000	3449000	They do synth-y songs in Rock Band once in a while.
3449000	3453000	I just think it's a darn shame. There's some pretty kick-ass Prince songs.
3453000	3458000	I wish they would just go above his head and go to Warner Brothers, which owns the old music, and just get it.
3458000	3464000	No, honestly, honestly, I would rather them get it from, get the permission of the artist,
3464000	3466000	because that's more respect to the artist himself.
3466000	3470000	He doesn't want his music in the game. He has every right to turn it down.
3470000	3472000	And if that's his reason...
3472000	3475000	And I have every right to call him a cock-knocker because of it.
3475000	3482000	If that's his reason, and it's his music, like, I would be the same way with my art if it was something that I didn't agree with.
3482000	3489000	If I had done something, now, if it was something that I was doing just, you know, like, corporate something or the other,
3489000	3492000	and that's the purpose I was being paid for, yeah, but if someone saw something that I did,
3492000	3498000	and say, wow, I think this would work good in my ad for anti-puppies.
3498000	3503000	But I like puppies, so I say, no, you can't, you do that. Or for, you know...
3503000	3506000	You made an ad against puppies? What's wrong with you?
3506000	3509000	What exactly is an anti-puppy?
3509000	3511000	A cat?
3511000	3513000	Well played.
3513000	3516000	Cats rule and dogs drool. Love, Jamie.
3516000	3522000	If it was for something that I didn't really support on my own, then I would say no,
3522000	3525000	and it would be my right because it's my work.
3525000	3531000	I agree with him that it's his work, he has the right not to support it with his work.
3531000	3533000	But I have the right to think he's kind of a douche because of it.
3533000	3536000	I mean, it's just fun. We just want to have fun.
3536000	3540000	You can think that all you want to, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still...
3540000	3542000	You're right, it's not going to change the end result, but...
3542000	3544000	It's still his right to say no.
3544000	3549000	Luckily, though, for you guys, that Guitar Hero is put together so lazily
3549000	3554000	that there are a lot of programs out there allowing you to create your own custom mixes.
3554000	3556000	I don't want to go to that kind of trouble.
3556000	3562000	I know, I'm just saying that if you want to put the effort in, you could get your own,
3562000	3564000	you know, Prince Guitar Hero.
3564000	3567000	Yeah, but I'm too lazy and that's what it really boils down to, so what can you do?
3567000	3569000	But really, who would really want to...
3569000	3572000	Who would really want to own, like, a Prince Guitar Hero?
3572000	3574000	I would not.
3574000	3576000	Unless it's like, you know, weird shaped guitar.
3576000	3580000	I would if you get purple velvet suits with it.
3580000	3585000	And if you get guitars shaped like that symbol, I actually might have to do it.
3585000	3586000	Come on.
3586000	3587000	That would be kind of cool.
3587000	3589000	See, even Loki can't resist.
3589000	3592000	It's just because it's so ridiculous.
3592000	3596000	I would like to see one that would actually have clips of purple rain in it.
3596000	3604000	Now the thing is, though, I want to see if they have, you know, available the... was it the Guitar Wolf microphones?
3604000	3607000	You know, the ones that shot fire out of them when you sang into them?
3607000	3609000	Yeah, that's cool shit right there.
3609000	3611000	Wait, is that like Dance Dance Simulation?
3611000	3613000	I don't know.
3613000	3616000	They have a Burning Man, the version of DDR that when you screw up it shoots fire on you.
3616000	3624000	But all I know is Guitar Wolf is awesome, and the movie Wild Zero is retarded and, you know, awesome at the same time.
3624000	3629000	Anyways, there is some pretty interesting stuff, though, coming to Rock Band.
3629000	3631000	I'm actually kind of excited about some of this.
3631000	3632000	Mainly one song.
3632000	3633000	Wait, I'm sorry.
3633000	3638000	Why is the chat room screaming about glitter right now?
3638000	3644000	Death Wishing says it would also come with a lot of glitter.
3644000	3645000	Probably.
3645000	3649000	Hopefully it comes with a vacuum, too, then.
3649000	3661000	You know, glitter is one of those things, like, if you throw glitter in your house, ever, or you let somebody that has too much glitter on their body, like, sit on your furniture, you will be finding that glitter like a year and a half afterwards.
3661000	3663000	Like, why is there glitter on my sofa?
3663000	3666000	Glitter sucks.
3666000	3679000	This week, Rock Band is actually getting quite a bit of content, including a Franz Ferdinand 3-pack, which will include Do You Want To, Lucid Dreams, and Take Me Out.
3679000	3689000	All those are available for $2 separately, or 160 Microsoft Points, or if you want to save 50 cents, you can buy the pack for 440 Microsoft Points, or $5.50.
3689000	3710000	Also, coming out, individual songs each for $2, or 160 Microsoft Points, including the one I'm looking forward to, Smooth Criminal by Alien Amp Farm, Blue Sky by the Allman Brothers, Midnight Rider by the Allman Brothers, Drain the Blood by the Distillers, Naked Eye by Lucius Jackson, or Luscious Jackson.
3710000	3713000	I love that song. That's one of the ones I'm going to buy.
3713000	3721000	And, let's see, Idealistic Types by Prong, and The Banishment by Prong, and that's coming out this week.
3721000	3734000	You know, it's not the play fanboy or anything here, and, you know, I'm really pro Rock Band, but it's sad when you see, and we're going to probably get into Guitar Hero's lineup for next month, or for this month,
3734000	3743000	it's sad to see that what's coming out one week for Rock Band is about the same as coming out the entire month for Guitar Hero. Just, you know.
3743000	3746000	I still don't own Guitar Hero World Tour. I don't see the point.
3746000	3746000	Yeah.
3746000	3752000	To be honest, like, all the songs I want to play are in Rock Band, and I don't mean to sound fanboy either, but too bad.
3752000	3761000	You know, like, when I look at the list of songs in Guitar Hero, and put it next to the list of the songs, including download content in Rock Band, Rock Band wins for me, and I don't see the need to own both.
3761000	3769000	I don't. Now, the ironic thing, though, the guitar I own is a Guitar Hero guitar, so if you're Guitar Hero fanboy, just STFU, sit down.
3769000	3771000	I still own the Guitar Hero guitars.
3771000	3771000	Yeah.
3771000	3774000	But, yeah, I don't really care for the game.
3774000	3786000	And the best part about Rock Band, though, is there's a lot of songs available on their Rock Band store. In fact, they have finally hit the milestone of 666 songs.
3786000	3791000	Yes. 666. The most.
3791000	3800000	Was there a 666 song, like, Skynyrd or Marilyn Manson, or what did they do? Was there a celebration for the 666 song?
3800000	3807000	No, there wasn't, but I didn't see what exactly was the 666 song.
3807000	3818000	Oh, I guess it was, um, it didn't really say it, but it was part of, whatever, Jane's Addiction's Nothing Shocking, one of those hit, you know, 666.
3818000	3821000	I guess Jane's Addiction works. I guess I can see that.
3821000	3821000	Yeah.
3821000	3830000	At least it wasn't, you know, but it would have been funnier if it was one of those, like, you know how they've done, like, the SpongeBob SquarePants stuff, and the, uh, you know, they had some of the, like, the Nickelodeon show or whatever?
3830000	3836000	Like, it would have been funny if they had had, like, Hannah Montana or something as the 666 song that came out. That would have been pretty funny.
3836000	3838000	So, good times.
3838000	3849000	Alright, anyhow, um, there's other music games, of course, on the horizon, not just, you know, Guitar Hero and Rock Band, but there's a new Wii game called Wii Rock Drum King.
3849000	3855000	Um, the game apparently is, uh, already on its way to Europe, and it's gonna come out in North America this year, but here's the thing.
3855000	3866000	It's gonna get redubbed Rolling Stone Drum King, and that's, uh, not because it has a deal with the actual band, the Rolling Stones.
3866000	3871000	It's based off the music magazine. You know, Rolling Stone, like, it's a huge magazine. It's like an oversized magazine.
3871000	3877000	They've been around for many, many, many years talking about music, and, uh, yeah, kinda interesting that it's gonna tie in there.
3877000	3885000	Uh, you're just gonna have to have two Wii remotes for air drumming. That's all you use in the game, and it's, uh, being developed by ARC System Works,
3885000	3893000	and some of the songs that you can see in the game, We Will Rock You by Queen, Final Countdown by Europe, Song 2 by Blur.
3893000	3898000	There you go, Dark Soccer. I know you're a Blur fan. Uh, Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz. Wow, there's lots of, uh...
3898000	3899000	That makes me happy.
3899000	3905000	There's lots of Damon love in this, uh, particular game, and, uh, such 90s classics as All Star by Smash Mouth.
3905000	3910000	So there you go. Just some of the songs you can play in the, uh, Rolling Stone Drum King.
3910000	3916000	So that's a name change from We Rock Drum King. So I guess it means lots of free ads in the magazine. We'll see.
3916000	3922000	Alrighty, a little more news for you guys before we take a break here at, uh, here on Orange Lunch Radio.
3922000	3930000	Well, there is a particular game that lots of people play just to make stuff in, and I am one of them.
3930000	3937000	Um, it's actually The Sims. There's stuff on Sims 3 out now. Um, there actually is going to be, um...
3937000	3949000	You get, well, and again, this is, uh, written of course for the UK audience, but, um, you get, um, six pounds worth of Sim points to spend at a Sims 3 store.
3949000	3958000	And you can buy clothes and furniture and all kinds of other stuff, um, and you can get extra points in bundles of 500, 1000, and 2000.
3958000	3964000	Um, you also get a game launcher, which is, um, meant to be a hub for the Sims community.
3964000	3968000	So you can get information and downloads and uploads and stuff. All kinds of things.
3968000	3973000	You can take pictures of your Sims and do videos and meh meh meh meh meh meh meh.
3973000	3979000	So, um, if you go to TheSims3.com, um, you can find the marketing website.
3979000	3987000	But, um, actually, uh, on the 5th of June, Cinco de Mayo, for all of us here who give a damn.
3987000	3988000	Wait, the 5th of June?
3988000	3990000	Sorry, I don't say, I meant 5th of June. I was thinking...
3990000	3995000	Okay, okay, I have to go off, we were planning a party, so I've had it stuck in my mind.
3995000	3996000	Ah, that's alright.
3996000	3999000	Sorry. And, no, no, you guys aren't invited.
3999000	4000000	Aww.
4000000	4003000	I meant, well, you guys are invited. I'm talking about the listeners.
4003000	4004000	I didn't want to come.
4004000	4013000	Well, you gotta come sometime. Anyway, um, sorry, 5th June, um, which, uh, will have a full community and product site.
4013000	4022000	And a new town, which you can download. And some stuff that's coming out for PC, Mac, iPhone, and iPod Touch.
4022000	4025000	And I actually might have to play it on my phone.
4025000	4028000	So you can go, uh, you people suck.
4028000	4033000	I just will be happy as long as there's, you know, textures and stuff.
4033000	4038000	I just want different ways to kill my Sims. That's really all I want.
4038000	4041000	I want more haunted houses. I want to make Silent Hill.
4041000	4044000	In, in Simverse.
4044000	4049000	I always liked making the elaborate death traps in The Sims, so that'll be fun to do in Sims 3.
4049000	4055000	You know, I always like to build a pool with no ladder to get out, and so they drown, because they're not smart enough to just climb out the side.
4055000	4056000	That's always fun.
4056000	4062000	I like going into debug mode and putting them up on the third floor of my house on a balcony that has no way out and a toilet.
4062000	4065000	So that they at least could go to the bathroom, but they'd starve to death.
4065000	4069000	Didn't you try to build the diving board really high up into the pool?
4069000	4070000	Yes, on the third floor.
4070000	4074000	What you were going to do is you were going to pause it while they were in mid-air and then take out the pool?
4074000	4079000	I wanted to do that, or I wanted to, I like, put the diving board out so that they, you know...
4079000	4087000	My favorite thing to do is just to make the human terrarium, where you get, like, all clear doors, you know, glass walls.
4087000	4092000	And then you put, you put them in the, you get them to go into the room, like, by leaving some chicken or something in there.
4092000	4096000	And then you pause the game and add the other walls so that people can just watch them.
4096000	4099000	I know what I'm, I know what I'm going to do.
4099000	4105000	You know, this new one, they've got, like, a lot of video, you know, editing features and that kind of stuff.
4105000	4107000	Saw.
4107000	4108000	Oh God.
4108000	4111000	I wonder if we're going to get any more strangerhood with The Sims 3.
4111000	4114000	Because that was pretty funny, by the guys that do Red vs. Blue.
4114000	4118000	If I had more time, I'd say let's do, like, an OLR in The Sims. That'd be fun.
4118000	4120000	We could totally.
4120000	4127000	I will never forget, however, the house that my old roommate built in The Sims, where he put, like...
4127000	4129000	What was the most people he could have in a house? Like, six?
4129000	4134000	So he put five men that would all, like, make out with each other and kiss each other and all this stuff.
4134000	4137000	He put five men in the house and one woman.
4137000	4140000	And he forgot to put a bathroom in the house.
4140000	4142000	So everybody would just do their business on the floor.
4142000	4147000	And he'd make the woman clean it up and do all the cooking and cleaning.
4147000	4152000	All the guys just continued their sex orgy all day and night.
4152000	4156000	And she never got to sleep and she finally died of sadness.
4156000	4161000	But we were all laughing so hard at the concept.
4161000	4164000	Like, seriously, my side hurt from laughing so hard.
4164000	4167000	Because we're so mature. So there you go.
4167000	4169000	Okay, they're saying in the chat the limit was eight.
4169000	4171000	That it was seven men and one woman.
4171000	4174000	And the woman had to clean up after the mess the guys made.
4174000	4178000	Good times.
4178000	4184000	There's another game that's going to be revealed by Square Enix, apparently, soon.
4184000	4186000	Possibly at E3.
4186000	4195000	This is coming from, they have a special URL at squareenix.co.jp slash mystery.
4195000	4202000	And there is a screenshot that looks like a giant rendered futuristic cityscape.
4202000	4206000	And basically a quote from John F. Kennedy saying,
4206000	4216000	The world is very different now, for man holds in his hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.
4216000	4229000	And people are thinking, huh, that's probably Front Mission now coming out on 360 or maybe the PS3.
4229000	4231000	Should I get excited? I'm not very serious.
4231000	4236000	I don't know. Front Mission is a mech kind of military strategy game.
4236000	4238000	It's more of a tactical game.
4238000	4240000	And I think it would be very cool if they brought it out.
4240000	4242000	Oh yeah, I think I have played this, after all.
4242000	4244000	I think I did play this on another system.
4244000	4245000	A long time ago.
4245000	4246000	Yeah.
4246000	4248000	Interesting.
4248000	4255000	And also, apparently, I guess the same image was used at Teaser, also in the official Xbox magazine, according to 1UP.
4255000	4263000	And the teaser text made it very clear that it was going to be Front Mission for the 360.
4263000	4268000	Without saying that it is, they pointed their finger at it.
4268000	4276000	Well, one game that has been confirmed that is coming out is a version of Soul Calibur for the PlayStation Portable.
4276000	4280000	It's coming out this summer. It's a game called Soul Calibur Broken Destiny.
4280000	4282000	Some of the first details leaked about this this week.
4282000	4288000	It looks very similar to Soul Calibur 4, but it's not a port of Soul Calibur 4.
4288000	4289000	It is kind of a new game.
4289000	4298000	Some of the characters that will be in it, Taki, Mitsurugi, Tyra, Astaroth, Ivy, Cassandra, Voldo, Siegfried, and Hilda are all going to be in this game.
4298000	4300000	Apparently, there's also a new fighter.
4300000	4306000	Dampier is the new fighter, and I guess this guy has wrist blades.
4306000	4308000	Kind of interesting.
4308000	4315000	Also, there's supposed to be some character customization, which has been in the more recent Soul Calibur games, and ad hoc wireless play.
4315000	4318000	Not over the internet, but at least you get that same room wireless play.
4318000	4321000	That's called Soul Calibur Broken Destiny.
4321000	4323000	I guess that could be cool. I like the Soul Calibur games.
4323000	4329000	I'm sad, though, that The Apprentice won't be in it, because that was the best character in Soul Calibur 4, was The Apprentice.
4329000	4330000	You think so?
4330000	4332000	I think so, even though so many people hate him.
4332000	4334000	I think he was awesome.
4334000	4338000	If you haven't played the game, it's The Apprentice from the Star Wars series.
4338000	4343000	I had Yoda and Darth Vader, and The Apprentice was the other Star Wars character, and he was pretty awesome.
4343000	4351000	Speaking of fighting games from Namco, I'll tell you what makes me super happy is Tekken 6.
4351000	4357000	It's going to be on the PSP, though, along with the console version, so that's pretty cool.
4357000	4366000	Except it'll have some exclusive content. It'll have certain items, certain stages, and a ghost mode,
4366000	4374000	which means that you can download and share character data to play versus matches with.
4374000	4387000	So I guess sort of like how the conquest mode was in the old Soul Calibur in the arcade, where we used to beat up each other's characters.
4387000	4392000	So it's pretty cool. I'm looking forward to it.
4392000	4399000	Cool. There's another thing coming out, kind of tying in with the whole SNK fighting game series.
4399000	4405000	SNK, The King of Fighters, is actually getting an online franchise, The King of Fighters Online.
4405000	4412000	It's going to be developed by AAA Games, and apparently is a PC-only title right now.
4412000	4417000	And no word on whether that's coming out over here as well.
4417000	4424000	I know right now it's supposed to be available in the Asian regions, and it's coming out on the first half of 2010.
4424000	4432000	I can't tell if this is actually a fighting game or a brawler game, but it looks good though, so that's kind of cool.
4432000	4438000	What's up with this? Didn't we just have a King of Fighters shoot-em-up last week, and now we have an RPG?
4438000	4440000	I guess so. They're branching out.
4440000	4443000	Interesting. Why suddenly all the King of Fighters love?
4443000	4446000	I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a fun series, but it's a little weird.
4446000	4450000	I mean, really, a shoot-em-up with fighting game characters? A role-playing game?
4450000	4455000	What the heck. This reminds me of the Mortal Kombat story modes and some of those...
4455000	4460000	Like, you know the Mortal Kombat games they had on the Xbox and stuff? You had those story modes that were really cheesy?
4460000	4465000	That's kind of what this reminds me of for some reason. I don't know if it has anything to do with that. I don't know.
4465000	4471000	Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Classic Game of the Week and the end of this half of the show.
4471000	4476000	You might have heard us talk about a game previously called Six Days in Fallujah.
4476000	4487000	It was a game that was going to be published by Konami, and the game had to do with one of the big battles that happened in, of course, the recent Iraq war that is actually still going on.
4487000	4491000	Well, Konami has pulled a plug on it with this quote.
4491000	4499000	After seeing the reaction of the video game in the United States and hearing opinions sent through phone calls and email, we decided several days ago not to sell it.
4499000	4505000	And that came from a Konami spokesperson talking to Sahi, which is a Japanese news site.
4505000	4517000	Don't know, though, if the game has been pulled entirely because, you know, the developers, Atomic Games, they could still put it out with another publisher, but this is certainly going to be a dent in it.
4517000	4521000	So, and some people are saying, you know what? It was just too soon.
4521000	4525000	Do you think it was? Do you think it was too soon for a game like this?
4525000	4535000	No. It's relevant. I mean, you wait any longer, it loses its relevance. It doesn't have the same impact it would otherwise.
4535000	4537000	I kind of agree. If you don't like it, don't buy it.
4537000	4542000	I mean, I went about this game because I don't like war games anyway, whether it's World War II or, you know, history wars.
4542000	4545000	There's very few of those types of war games I'm into at all.
4545000	4556000	So this, I just kind of looped this in with that category. But, you know, these memories, you know, there have been people that died in this war that has happened very recently.
4556000	4559000	I had a friend from high school who passed away in Iraq. It's tragic.
4559000	4565000	And so why would it actually be respectful to pay what they went through justice? I think.
4565000	4567000	Oh, I don't have a problem with the game, but I'm just, you know.
4567000	4575000	This actually goes to me with a tendency of people to want to bury their head in the sand and ignore that bad shit happens in the world, you know?
4575000	4581000	You know, people who just want to go, oh, well, that sucks. Boohoo. Paris Hilton. Oh, my God.
4581000	4591000	You know, it's that whole, we want to look past it and not think it was really there by claiming that it's too soon or disrespectful or whatever.
4591000	4600000	But I think that people really need to have the reality of the situation driven home. And what better way to do it than a video game that's based off of accounts of people who were there?
4600000	4607000	You know, maybe I'm just desensitized to the whole too soon thing. You know, I've mentioned on the show before, I've done Rocky Horror Picture Show for years and years and years.
4607000	4613000	And we like to make jokes about things that are oftentimes, it's way too soon to make the jokes.
4613000	4622000	For instance, the last time I went to Rocky Horror was the day that Bea Arthur died. And somebody cracked a joke that evening about how, did you guys hear Bea Arthur died of cancer today?
4622000	4628000	And it was really sad. It's too bad that she had testicular cancer. See? See? And you're laughing.
4628000	4629000	I know. That's fantastic.
4629000	4632000	See? But like, you know, that was the day she died.
4632000	4635000	But this wouldn't be meant to be humorous. It's a different story.
4635000	4636000	No, I know. I know. I know.
4636000	4639000	You know, I'm a fan of shock humor. Don't get me wrong.
4639000	4648000	I say that because we all have different ways of remembering things. You know what? And for me personally, I laughed my ass off at that joke.
4648000	4653000	But I loved Bea Arthur because I grew up on the Golden Girls. You know, I remember watching that with my mother, you know.
4653000	4659000	I just remember watching the Deadpool PSAs with him having a poster in his room that says, don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like Bea?
4659000	4666000	All right. But look, look, look. But my point is, is that, you know, some people laugh at funerals and that's just how they cope.
4666000	4669000	I don't know. Loki, you wanted to say something. I'm sorry.
4669000	4678000	Oh, I was saying that people probably take offense to the fact that the game, not only they spoke to, obviously, the soldiers that were fighting over there, but also the insurgents as well.
4678000	4682000	Including, you know, some terror cells or that kind of stuff.
4682000	4690000	So, I don't know. Whatever. It probably wouldn't have been that good anyways, to be honest.
4690000	4699000	But I'm sure it'll come out eventually. There's a lot of publishers out there and a lot of them that like to take, you know, games like this that are done and publish them.
4699000	4704000	Especially smaller companies that'll take the ones that no one else wants.
4704000	4711000	All right. Well, we will see what will become of this game, if anything at all. And if it raises a ruckus when it comes out.
4711000	4722000	I'm sure there will be that sensationalist news report, you know, the Channel 13 Looks exclusive look at this, you know, oh, there's a video game that you can replicate what's going on in Iraq.
4722000	4729000	And it's just gonna, people are just gonna not get the context of it and take it the completely wrong way. So, whatever.
4729000	4733000	Anyhow, let's get into a happier subject, shall we?
4733000	4735000	I want to talk about Bea Arthur.
4735000	4738000	We can talk about Bea Arthur, but that's not usually what this music is for.
4738000	4739000	I am.
4739000	4750000	This music symbolizes the classic video game of the week. That's right, a segment on the show where Dark Sakura digs through the archives of games and finds one that she believes you should all be playing.
4750000	4757000	And, you know, especially with knowing what Dark Sakura's picked this week, classic doesn't have to be super old.
4757000	4760000	Even more recent games can be classics.
4760000	4763000	Well, the one I picked is, you know, eight years old.
4763000	4764000	All right, so it's still...
4764000	4771000	So I want to see if our people in the chat room can figure out what it is based on the intro to the game.
4771000	4773000	Here it is.
4773000	4782000	James, honey, did something happen to you after we got separated in that long hallway?
4782000	4790000	Are you confusing me with someone else?
4790000	4793000	You were always so forgetful.
4793000	4798000	What about that time in the hotel?
4798000	4801000	Maria?
4801000	4808000	You said you took everything, but you forgot that videotape we made.
4808000	4810000	I thought people would totally...
4810000	4814000	Yep, we got guesses already, and we're pretty close.
4814000	4816000	It's Silent Hill 2.
4816000	4818000	The Rob D is the first one to get it.
4818000	4820000	Guess what? You win something.
4820000	4821000	Hmm.
4821000	4824000	The Rob D, you win my TurboGrafx.
4824000	4827000	Wow. That was easy.
4827000	4828000	Yep.
4828000	4831000	I can even take it to him, too.
4831000	4832000	Okay.
4832000	4834000	All right. Get it to me next week. We'll go take him TurboGrafx.
4834000	4835000	We'll have to autograph it.
4835000	4840000	So, Rob D, you win my No Controller TurboGrafx.
4840000	4842000	I didn't even know you were doing a giveaway.
4842000	4844000	That was the surprise.
4844000	4846000	Well, look at you. All right.
4846000	4849000	So, I have to just remember where we put it.
4849000	4851000	Anyway, we've been cleaning.
4851000	4858000	So, yes. Silent Hill 2 is the game du jour, or I should say, of the week.
4858000	4864000	And the reason why I picked Silent Hill 2, even though this is not my favorite of the Silent Hill series,
4864000	4866000	it's a lot of people's favorites.
4866000	4870000	So, I wanted to throw the bone out to the big fans of Silent Hill 2.
4870000	4882000	So, with this particular game, it's, you know, basically this guy goes back to the town of Silent Hill.
4882000	4884000	It's, you know, third person's perspective.
4884000	4889000	You play as this dude named James who is mourning the loss of his wife, Mary,
4889000	4894000	and he gets a letter from her saying they meet at their spot, and instead he finds Maria.
4894000	4902000	So, as the game goes on, it's pretty disturbing Silent Hill stuff, blood, pyramid head,
4902000	4908000	and yes, this game is the introduction of, by proper name, Red Pyramid.
4908000	4910000	Two of them, in fact.
4910000	4912000	So, that's pretty awesome.
4912000	4915000	This is the game that gave us the Red Pyramid.
4915000	4919000	Or as you all know him as, happy fun time rapey pyramid head.
4919000	4920000	Pea-hitty.
4920000	4921000	Pea-hitty.
4921000	4924000	That's why I call him a pea-hitty, you know, we're tight like that.
4924000	4931000	Anyway, so you know, you solve your little puzzles, and you pick up things, and you find things,
4931000	4933000	and you get a chainsaw at some point.
4933000	4937000	Chainsaw is awesome.
4937000	4941000	And, which I've seen Shane beat the game with a chainsaw, didn't he?
4941000	4942000	I wasn't there for that.
4942000	4944000	He beat Pyramid Head with a chainsaw.
4944000	4945000	That's fun.
4945000	4946000	That was pretty cool.
4946000	4947000	One of the times, anyway.
4947000	4954000	And of course, you've got your chick, Maria, hanging out with you, who, well, poor girl has no luck.
4954000	4958000	I won't say anything that happens to her, but if you haven't played it yet, oh well, whatever.
4958000	4960000	You also have multiple endings on this game.
4960000	4964000	You've got up to, you have three endings.
4964000	4965000	Over there!
4965000	4973000	Actually, yeah, three endings, I think, involving the actual story of the game.
4973000	4976000	Some of them are really fucked up and sad.
4976000	4980000	Some of them are, oh, there's one that's kind of happy.
4980000	4982000	And then, you get joke endings.
4982000	4985000	You get the UFO ending, which every Silent Hill game has.
4985000	4991000	And then, my favorite, the dog ending.
4991000	4999000	With the, of course, with the dog ending, it's just, it shows that a Shiba Inu is actually controlling the entire events of the game.
4999000	5002000	And of course, the UFO ending, James gets abducted.
5002000	5017000	There's also, though, yes, this is the music from the dog ending.
5017000	5018000	I love the dog ending.
5018000	5019000	I love the dog ending, too.
5019000	5021000	I just, like, he comes over and goes, what? You did all this?
5021000	5024000	And the dog comes up and licks him.
5024000	5031000	I like that the dog, though, is wearing headphones, listening to a Kiriyama music.
5031000	5042000	At any rate, there's also some of the newer special versions.
5042000	5051000	Well, in the special edition releases, there is a game, a little side story called Born From a Wish.
5051000	5059000	And this is actually in the Restless Dreams edition, or for Europe, the Interfears edition.
5059000	5060000	Ow, what's wrong?
5060000	5062000	I just pricked myself.
5062000	5069000	Also, I believe the Japanese one is called Saigo no Uta, which is Poem of the Last Moment.
5069000	5078000	But it is, it has the Born From a Wish story where you play as Maria, the other character in the game, leading up to her meeting with James at the beginning of the game.
5078000	5085000	It's a very, very interesting, actually, little, little story.
5085000	5090000	So, uh... I just want to point out, this is a scary, scary game.
5090000	5097000	Like, if you've never played a game like this before, you've got to try these types of, like, survival horror games, especially the Silent Hill series.
5097000	5101000	Because I'm telling you, these games are, like, so scary, like, they'll make your asshole slam shut.
5101000	5104000	Like, you know what I'm talking about. Like, one of those games where you're so tense.
5104000	5108000	Like, you're like, oh my gosh, I'm so scared, I don't know what's going to happen next.
5108000	5110000	So, this is a scary game.
5110000	5114000	Like, if you don't, if you think games can't scare you, play a game like this.
5114000	5116000	With all the lights off during a rainy night.
5116000	5125000	Well, the biggest thing, and this is why I like the Silent Hill series so much, is that it's a big look into the disturbing parts of the human psyche.
5125000	5127000	That's why I like it.
5127000	5136000	There's actually an enemy in this game who looks like, well, like a big rape going on.
5136000	5140000	But that was the person that that's supposed to be, that's, you know, what he did.
5140000	5148000	And, of course, Pyramid Head goes around banging all of the nurses and monsters and everything, getting in the way.
5148000	5159000	There is, also for the main character, like, you go into a room and he finds the dress that his dead wife wore.
5159000	5165000	And, you know, different things that relate to his psychosis, including the Red Pyramid being part of his psychosis.
5165000	5171000	The only character who does not see any of the monsters in the game is a little girl because she is innocent.
5171000	5176000	She doesn't have those type of deep-rooted, you know, issues going on.
5176000	5178000	Even though I seem to recall her being kind of a bitch.
5178000	5182000	She was. But she didn't have to deal with any of that as a point.
5182000	5198000	Also, another thing that I was looking at is that the character Mary came from Mary Ann Nichols and Mary Jane Kelly, who were Jack the Ripper's first and last victims.
5198000	5205000	And, you know, there was a character based off of Eddie Murphy when he was supposed to be, you know, more pleasant.
5205000	5211000	And a character named Angela, who was based off of the protagonist in The Net.
5211000	5214000	Oh, I never realized that. Interesting.
5214000	5223000	They've all been... And also, and this is something I didn't know, the layout of Silent Hill in the game was based off of San Bruno, California.
5223000	5229000	So, it is, to me, one of the best games ever. I love the soundtrack.
5229000	5235000	I actually used to wake up every morning to the theme of Lara, which was on that soundtrack.
5235000	5240000	Every morning. Until I got sick of it and had to change it to The Birthday Massacre.
5240000	5246000	And, also, if anyone wants to know about the movie, yeah, the second movie's coming, but Gons isn't involved.
5246000	5249000	So, has nothing to do with the game, though.
5249000	5258000	Well, as far as this game and that story being involved together, but, yeah, Silent Hill 2 is freaking rad.
5258000	5263000	Play it. And, by the way, my favorite is Silent Hill 3.
5263000	5272000	Alright. Well, there you go. Your classic game of the week, Silent Hill 2, available on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
5272000	5279000	And PC, but don't play the PC version, because it's ass. Bunch of ass. Worst control ever.
5279000	5285000	Alright. And then, maybe in the future, we'll hear a little bit about Silent Hill 3, since it is your favorite of the series.
5285000	5288000	Alright. Anyhow, though, we are going to take a break.
5288000	5292000	We're pretty long. We've been going for about an hour and a half. It's about 7.40 here on the West Coast.
5292000	5296000	We're going to take a break, and when we come back, more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5296000	5306000	We have plenty of news stories we still have to get to, including a very interesting remake that we've heard about that's going to be on the way for Xbox Live Arcade and possibly some other games as well.
5306000	5310000	As well as some game delays and some more rumors. It should be fun.
5310000	5316000	Also, stay tuned, because guess what? The contest, you know, I didn't even know.
5316000	5319000	It was such a surprise contest we just had on the show. I didn't even know it was happening.
5319000	5323000	But Dark Soccer just gave away Turbografx-16. That's not the only thing we're giving away tonight.
5323000	5329000	We are giving away a signed autographed copy of DDR on the PlayStation 2, signed by SmileDK.
5329000	5333000	And that's thanks to Breslul, who got that at the SakuraCon.
5333000	5339000	So we're going to be telling you more about that contest very soon on the podcast. Just stay tuned.
5339000	5345000	This is not something you have to be listening to live. Our podcast listeners will get a chance to win this as well, as well as our live listeners.
5345000	5349000	So stay tuned. We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5355000	5360000	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. And guess what, guys? It's time to do the giveaway.
5360000	5362000	Or at least I'm going to tell you guys a little more about the giveaway.
5362000	5367000	But first we are going to turn the moderation on in the chatroom there so that there's no talking amongst chat.
5367000	5370000	So that you guys don't try to give away the answers to each other.
5370000	5376000	Here's how it's going to work. What we're going to do, we're going to play five clips of DDR songs from the past.
5376000	5383000	And if you know the answer to all five songs, send an email to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5383000	5390000	And make sure that somewhere in the subject you say, contest, or it will get mixed up with the regular emails we get in there.
5390000	5396000	You need to say, contest. And if you know the answers to those, we'll draw one from the total...
5396000	5399000	Whoever has the most correct answers, we'll draw from that.
5399000	5405000	So even if you don't know all five, send it in anyway. Because if people can only get four of the five, you might still win.
5405000	5414000	And again, what you're going to win, a copy of DDR Supernova 2 for the Playstation 2, autographed by SmileDK, who is infamous for Butterfly.
5414000	5418000	And various other DDR songs as well. You should know them if you're a fan.
5418000	5421000	We want to make sure a fan of DDR wins it, so this is how we're going to test you.
5421000	5433000	We're going to play clips of five DDR songs, so here we go. Here is song number one.
5433000	5446000	Here is song number two.
5446000	5458000	Here is song number three.
5458000	5470000	Here is song number four.
5470000	5483000	And lastly, here is song number five.
5483000	5487000	Okay, there it is. Those are the five songs. This is open to the podcast listeners as well.
5487000	5493000	We're not going to draw a name until two weeks from tonight on our show on May 17th.
5493000	5495000	I guess that would be two weeks from tonight.
5495000	5500000	May 17th is when we'll draw the name, so get those contest entries in. Again, you want to get as many of those songs as possible.
5500000	5504000	Send in those emails to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
5504000	5509000	Make sure the subject says contest somewhere in it or it will not count.
5509000	5514000	I can't stress that enough. You need to put contest in the subject or something with the word contest in it.
5514000	5518000	You can put I love Rob, contest. As long as the word contest is in there, it'll be cool.
5518000	5526000	So there you go. The five songs for the contest this week. Giving away an autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2 by SmileDK.
5526000	5531000	Alright, I'm going to let you guys be able to talk and chat again. No giving away answers.
5531000	5534000	Alright, no giving away answers. There we go.
5534000	5540000	Okay, I guess we're ready to get back into tonight's Orange Lounge Radio, so let's do it.
5540000	5543000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening.
5543000	5549000	May the 3rd of 2009, where we tape live. Every Sunday night, of course, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5549000	5558000	On All Games Radio, www.AllGames.com is where we tape our show and allow you guys to interact with us through ways such as chat and so on and so on.
5558000	5562000	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news. We had a pretty fun first segment talking about some different things.
5562000	5565000	Let's get back into gaming news. Loki.
5565000	5574000	Well, apparently, it's the 25th anniversary tour for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They have an exhibit traveling across the country right now.
5574000	5579000	And part of that exhibit is a game being shown off on the Xbox 360.
5579000	5584000	It's an alpha version of what looks like a remake of Turtles in Time.
5584000	5588000	And by the looks of it, you would probably guess that it's for Xbox Live Arcade.
5588000	5593000	But, of course, possibly could make its way to the Playstation Network and WiiWare as well.
5593000	5598000	And it looks kinda cool, but definitely looks like Xbox Live Arcade material.
5602000	5603000	So, pretty cool.
5603000	5606000	I know this is a game a lot of people are very excited about.
5606000	5610000	Yeah, and it is alpha right now, so it could be a while.
5610000	5616000	I like that they've kinda reskinned it. It's not just a re-release of the game, but they've totally reskinned the whole thing, which is kinda cool.
5616000	5617000	Yeah, it looks nice.
5618000	5621000	So, alright. Very cool.
5621000	5625000	Well, that's not the only release coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
5625000	5630000	Space Invaders Extreme looks to be finally getting a release on Xbox Live Arcade this week.
5630000	5631000	Hurray!
5631000	5639000	Probably because the game, I think, was supposed to be out last month, but finally they're saying it's gonna see its release this week for approximately 800 Microsoft points.
5639000	5643000	They're not 100% sure if that's gonna be the final cost, but it looks like 800 Microsoft points.
5643000	5647000	Microsoft should either confirm or deny this tomorrow on Monday.
5647000	5653000	But I know I love this game on the PSP, so I'll probably pick it up on Xbox Live Marketplace, too, because I think it'll be fun to play in high def.
5653000	5656000	It has a great soundtrack. It has a great, great soundtrack.
5656000	5658000	So, I'm definitely looking forward to this game.
5658000	5660000	So, I'll check that out this week.
5660000	5663000	Well, how about something that has really nothing much to do with Xbox Live Arcade?
5663000	5664000	Okay.
5664000	5666000	It has to do with the zoo.
5666000	5673000	Yes, the Edinburgh Zoo renames their Wolverine in honor of Wolverine.
5673000	5675000	They named him Logan.
5675000	5684000	And I guess the tie-in that this has is that the picture that they put up is a picture of the Wolverine, and behind him was one for the game, Standy.
5684000	5694000	But they are using the, I guess, the fame of the movie right now to promote the fact that these are endangered animals.
5694000	5698000	I know Tigerclaw was in chat before the show telling me I need to check out the game.
5698000	5700000	He says the game is better than the movie.
5700000	5703000	And that's kind of surprising to hear because usually movie-based games are crap.
5703000	5706000	But he says the game based on the movie is pretty good.
5706000	5708000	Well, I should give it a rent.
5708000	5710000	Yeah, you should. Definitely check it out and let us know.
5710000	5713000	Because, you know, you are the comic book fangirl.
5713000	5715000	Did you participate in Free Comic Book Day?
5715000	5716000	I didn't.
5716000	5717000	Oh, no. How sad.
5717000	5718000	I had lots to do.
5718000	5719000	Oh, that's a bummer.
5719000	5721000	I was going to get out there, but I just, you know, forgot.
5721000	5724000	I've never been much of a comic book nerd, but hey, it's free.
5724000	5726000	You should have gone and got me one.
5726000	5728000	I know. I just forgot.
5728000	5732000	And I had other stuff going on yesterday, so I just never thought to go to the comic book store.
5732000	5735000	So, oh well. It happens.
5735000	5737000	Alright, let's move on. More gaming news.
5737000	5744000	Yes. Let's see. Well, we've got some other, well, kind of unfortunate news.
5744000	5747000	Also kind of tied in with the movies. You know, the whole Batman stuff.
5747000	5749000	Very successful movie.
5749000	5751000	Well, there's of course a new game coming out for Batman.
5751000	5754000	Batman Arkham Asylum. It's supposed to be out in June.
5754000	5758000	However, it's been delayed now to the end of summer.
5758000	5760000	D'oh.
5760000	5763000	Why? Just because they can?
5763000	5774000	Basically that it's, you know, to ensure, give the devs an extra amount of time to make sure the game is, you know, the highest quality for gamers.
5774000	5778000	So, in other words, the game's broken right now. It's got too many bugs. They don't want to release it the way it is right now.
5778000	5779000	I guess.
5779000	5781000	That's what it sounds like to me.
5781000	5784000	Alright, well, you know, I guess, isn't it worth the wait, though?
5784000	5786000	If they're going to fix the problems with the game, it's worth the wait, right?
5786000	5788000	Definitely.
5788000	5793000	It makes sense, though, to position it more towards the fourth quarter because it's, you know, a pretty big game.
5793000	5795000	This game does look kind of interesting, I gotta say.
5795000	5796000	Yeah.
5796000	5798000	So, I will definitely check it out.
5798000	5801000	Well, you know I love Batman anyway, but usually the games aren't that great.
5801000	5806000	There hasn't been, like, a really, really good Batman game that I've loved since the NES Batman game.
5806000	5807000	Batman Returns?
5807000	5809000	No, the original Batman game.
5809000	5810000	Nintendo?
5810000	5811000	Huh.
5811000	5814000	That they had. That was the last one I really remember liking.
5814000	5817000	I guess I heard Lego Batman's pretty good, though. I haven't checked it out, though.
5817000	5819000	Supposed to be. I haven't played it, though.
5819000	5821000	I haven't played it, so maybe I'm not being fair, so we'll see.
5821000	5823000	Hopefully soon.
5823000	5826000	Alright, moving on.
5826000	5829000	Lost Planet 2 is the game we knew was coming.
5829000	5832000	Apparently some new footage has been revealed for Lost Planet 2.
5832000	5837000	And apparently Capcom is trying to get a demo available for E3.
5837000	5838000	And guess what?
5838000	5845000	Not only is it going to be playable on the show floor at E3, but they are going to try to do one of those, you know, bring it home type things on Xbox Live again.
5845000	5846000	They did with the first one.
5846000	5852000	Yep, and they'll release a demo during E3 for everybody to play at home via Xbox Live Marketplace.
5852000	5854000	And this is all from the Capcom Unity blog.
5854000	5858000	There's some new trailers, some new screenshots that you can look at.
5858000	5862000	And they are hoping that there will be a demo available by E3.
5862000	5866000	By the way, there will be four player co-op in the game if you haven't heard yet.
5866000	5868000	And there's going to be a ranking system as well.
5868000	5872000	So you can compete for the biggest E-peen in Lost Planet 2.
5872000	5877000	Which looks to have ditched the snow for more of a... looks like more of an Amazonian...
5877000	5881000	Well, they didn't really ditch the snow, it's just the planet's starting to thaw.
5881000	5882000	Oh, okay.
5882000	5884000	Which I guess there was a little bit of it in the first game.
5884000	5886000	They put it in a defrost setting in the microwave.
5886000	5889000	Apparently, because it does look a little thawed out this time.
5889000	5891000	So it looks a little more jungly.
5891000	5897000	You do still see the snow in some parts, but, you know, has more of a lush green look to it than last time.
5897000	5902000	Well, you know, there's other things that have, you know, a green look to them.
5902000	5903000	And that would be zombies.
5903000	5906000	Zombies typically look green or gray.
5906000	5909000	Well, usually they're red after dining on blood.
5909000	5911000	Well, enough blood on them, yeah.
5911000	5914000	But I mean the flesh tone, you know, is kind of that green gray sickly looking thing.
5914000	5917000	But there is news about Dead Rising 2.
5917000	5922000	When they said that there were going to be multiplayer sessions.
5922000	5929000	Well, they were actually correct on that one.
5929000	5934000	Capcom said that there will be online multiplayer.
5934000	5936000	No details on it, but said that there will be.
5936000	5938000	So that's cool.
5938000	5944000	Oh, the one thing that Dead Rising 1 was missing is going to be in Dead Rising 2.
5944000	5946000	That sounds pretty amazing to me.
5946000	5949000	As long as you can still run over Amino with a lot more.
5949000	5951000	Hopefully. That's what I'm hoping for.
5951000	5953000	Well, they were showing off some pretty cool stuff.
5953000	5957000	Apparently the main character now, since he's not, you know, a photographer.
5957000	5959000	He's more of like a carpenter guy.
5959000	5961000	He can kind of fashion his own weapons.
5961000	5967000	So he had like two chainsaws strapped to, you know, this giant, you know, stick.
5967000	5972000	And then he strapped two chainsaws to his motorcycle and drove through a crowd of zombies.
5972000	5974000	So he gets the MacGryverism skill?
5974000	5979000	Yeah, and apparently they had up to 7,000 zombies on screen at a time.
5979000	5982000	So, that sounds sweet.
5982000	5988000	Another thing that sounds kind of sweet, actually, even though the first game was very disappointing.
5988000	5989000	Red Steel 2.
5989000	5995000	Red Steel 2 has been announced and it's apparently going to the Wild West.
5995000	5999000	It's going to feature motion plus support.
5999000	6005000	I'm not really sure if it's actually a Wild West game, but, you know, the main character kind of looks like he could be out of the Wild West.
6005000	6015000	But it looks really cool and they kind of got this cel-shaded look to it as well, which, you know, is kind of the rage nowadays.
6015000	6017000	And it looks pretty cool.
6017000	6024000	One word, though, that I have heard about it, though, is that it's supposed to be only motion plus.
6024000	6027000	You have to use motion plus to play this game.
6027000	6032000	So I don't know if they can actually do that, if that's going to be, you know, kind of a deal breaker for some people.
6032000	6036000	Motion plus with sword fighting sounds awesome.
6036000	6040000	Because I know the first game, man, control sucked.
6040000	6045000	Do you think it's really going to get better or is this kind of one of those, you know, all talk?
6045000	6048000	I think it could get better, but it's not even perfect.
6048000	6051000	I mean, they could very well make it, you know, really good.
6051000	6055000	But before, you know, the controls were kind of wonky, but we'll see.
6055000	6060000	I mean, they did some pretty innovative stuff with it, but it just didn't work very well.
6060000	6064000	GS68 in chat disagrees, says no Red Steel 2 will suck.
6064000	6068000	Act-Def says they'll probably bundle Red Steel 2 with motion plus.
6068000	6070000	Well, they're doing a lot of those bundles.
6070000	6072000	They got to try to sell that motion plus.
6072000	6075000	So does this mean that motion plus is going to be required for the game?
6075000	6076000	Yes, that's what they're saying right now.
6076000	6078000	Interesting.
6078000	6083000	So if they don't have a bundle with motion plus, aren't they severely limiting their audience?
6083000	6084000	I think so.
6084000	6090000	I would think people who would buy this would not necessarily be the same audience that's going to pick up a game like Wii Sports Resort, you know?
6090000	6093000	Well, motion plus is going to be sold separately, though, over the month prior to that.
6093000	6096000	And they've also got a bundle with, like, Tiger Woods.
6096000	6106000	They're also doing a bundle with EA Sports Tennis Grand Slam that's going to be, or Grand Slam Tennis that's coming out, you know, before Tiger Woods even in Europe.
6106000	6109000	And who knows, I mean, more bundles with this thing.
6109000	6111000	They got to sell those, you know, motion plus things.
6111000	6118000	They got to get people to realize, hey, you guys should spend another $20 on sensors that should have been in there in the first place.
6118000	6120000	Exactly.
6120000	6124000	And then we can come out with the controller with the sensors built in. Ha, bitches!
6124000	6125000	Yeah.
6125000	6127000	Then they can think of something else they forgot.
6127000	6131000	Then it'll be, oh, but now you want to get the Wii HD so that our graphics can be on there.
6131000	6136000	Oh, you need to get the Wii Balance Board Plus because now it has more sensors and is even more sensitive than before.
6136000	6140000	I bet you anything you'll see something stupid like that.
6140000	6144000	Haven't there already been rumors of a Wii Fit Plus?
6144000	6150000	Yes, there has been a Wii Fit Plus with the Balance Board, but I don't know if that's just the same Balance Board.
6150000	6152000	It might be the same Balance Board, I mean.
6152000	6157000	I don't know. Have you ever tried controlling Balance Board games? It's not very fun.
6157000	6160000	Just Wii Fit and it works okay. It's not that bad.
6160000	6162000	Like the marble rolling game?
6162000	6166000	Yeah, it's alright. It's very, very sensitive. It's very, very, very sensitive.
6166000	6170000	But I think because those games are supposed to challenge your balance, it's why it's that way.
6170000	6178000	I haven't played any of the standalone balance games. There hasn't been anything that really, you know, caught my eye that I really want to get.
6178000	6185000	But this caught my eye and is something I probably really want to download. It's a remake of Adventure.
6185000	6190000	And I'm talking about Adventure for the old school Atari 2600. That's right.
6190000	6196000	It has apparently been remade, and I guess this is by folks that frequent the Penny Arcade forums.
6196000	6201000	They've done a completely unauthorized version. It's called Adventure 2600 Reboot.
6201000	6209000	Here's what makes this game cool. They've basically taken the Adventure setup and they've redone the whole darn thing in like 16-bit graphics.
6209000	6213000	And we're looking at a little YouTube here in studio what this game looks like.
6213000	6217000	And it's pretty cool because they actually have the dragon flying around and it's kind of neat.
6217000	6220000	But if you run into it, it'll eat you like it just did there.
6220000	6225000	Or you can get the sword and, you know, you remember the old game on the 2600? You get the key, they go up in the castle.
6225000	6229000	Well, they redid it in like all these cool little like 16-bit sprites. So I thought that was kind of cool.
6229000	6234000	Apparently this project took about seven months to complete. Kind of interesting.
6234000	6239000	The person who coded and designed Reboot, William Steinberg.
6239000	6243000	And he had a whole little interview with Game Set Watch talking about it.
6243000	6250000	And it was a whole team of people. It wasn't just this guy, but he was kind of the spokesperson talking about the project.
6250000	6255000	So pretty cool. I might have to check this out.
6255000	6256000	Do you think you will? For real?
6256000	6262000	I think I will. For real. If you want to find this, it's at slash x dot google pages dot com.
6262000	6265000	There's a whole little page about the Adventure 2600 Reboot.
6265000	6270000	And I get the sense why? Because we can.
6270000	6273000	There you go.
6273000	6277000	All right. So moving on now, we're going to get into tonight's mailbag.
6277000	6282000	When you guys send us emails at mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader dot com, we like to read our favorites here on the air.
6282000	6284000	And that's what we're going to do right now. DarkStalker is going to dive in.
6284000	6286000	I don't think there's a whole lot of emails tonight, sadly.
6286000	6287000	About your tongue.
6287000	6288000	Oh, did we get a lot?
6288000	6289000	We got a few.
6289000	6292000	Cool. So DarkStalker is going to dive in.
6292000	6296000	Good, because I put on the Twitter earlier that people needed to make you work. So I'm glad to hear they are.
6296000	6297000	What did you do that for?
6297000	6301000	All right. Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader dot com if you want to make her work.
6301000	6305000	This email. Cake or pie? That battle of the century.
6305000	6308000	From someone who sincerely loves old people.
6308000	6309000	Pie.
6309000	6311000	I like a good chocolate cake.
6311000	6313000	Pie always wins.
6313000	6315000	Okay, we actually have one from Dan Shadow.
6315000	6318000	Hey guys, what's more dangerous? Chimps or raptors? Help me out here.
6318000	6320000	Are these for real tonight?
6320000	6323000	I am serious and I'm reading them because you fucking made me.
6323000	6330000	Oh god, raptors. Look at Jurassic Park. Although chimps can carry Ebola virus like you saw in Outbreak.
6330000	6333000	You're thinking of velociraptors. A raptor is like a hawk.
6333000	6338000	Aren't velociraptors a kind of raptor?
6338000	6342000	I think chimps are dangerous if you give them a gun.
6342000	6344000	What if you give a raptor a gun?
6344000	6351000	Well, here's the thing. If you're actually talking about velociraptors, velociraptors are extinct and chimps are still alive and full of diseases.
6351000	6352000	So obviously it's chimps.
6352000	6353000	Fine.
6353000	6359000	Now if velociraptors came back from the dead, they would probably be full of diseases as well.
6359000	6362000	Raptors. Raptors are...
6362000	6368000	I would bet anything the emailer meant to say velociraptors because raptors by themselves are not that scary.
6368000	6369000	But velociraptors, terrifying.
6369000	6370000	But they're carnivores.
6370000	6374000	And raptors, the jets, those are pretty dangerous too, you know.
6374000	6377000	And the raptors flying velociraptors.
6377000	6379000	This comes from Gil.
6379000	6381000	And the monkeys, the band, I don't know how dangerous they'd be.
6381000	6384000	It's my first time writing in and I'll make it a short one.
6384000	6386000	What do you think about the new PSP Go?
6386000	6390000	How long until it will be hacked because the 3000s are not hackable to the public yet?
6390000	6394000	Should they release the hack or wait for the new PSP?
6394000	6398000	If they were smart, they would wait for the new PSP to come out, but they won't.
6398000	6399000	They won't.
6399000	6405000	They've already got a sort of proof of concept done already for the new PSP 3000.
6405000	6407000	Hacker groups are pretty competitive.
6407000	6412000	They don't want to sit on it and wait to have someone else beat them or else all their work is for naught.
6412000	6416000	But you will better believe that when that new system comes out, all they have to say is unhackable.
6416000	6419000	And then they'll be like, oh, we're going to get down on that shit.
6419000	6421000	And it'll be hacked before you know it.
6421000	6423000	It may take a little bit of time.
6423000	6427000	The problem is it may have to use an exploit in the game to do it.
6427000	6432000	But it'll be interesting because if everything is downloadable, they'll start to sneak the patches in the games and all that.
6432000	6435000	So you'll have to, you know, patch.
6435000	6437000	It will be interesting.
6437000	6438000	You know, they're always going to find a way.
6438000	6440000	They're always going to find a way to hack it.
6440000	6441000	This one.
6441000	6443000	Ready for the next email?
6443000	6444000	Yes.
6444000	6447000	Hey, OLR, I was wondering if you guys buy the PSP 3000.
6447000	6450000	I've been thinking about, OK, bad grammar.
6450000	6452000	I've been thinking about it.
6452000	6455000	I currently own four PSP 2 Slims and a THAT.
6455000	6459000	I'm interested in your thoughts because tonight you're going to talk about the PSP.
6459000	6465000	It's Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E, not Y-O-U-R. That's possessive. Duh.
6465000	6471000	Maybe I should just wait instead of just wait for the rumored PSP 2.
6471000	6473000	Sorry for the late notice.
6473000	6475000	L-O-L-C-U in chat.
6475000	6479000	Sincerely, Hungrymercrunk.
6479000	6481000	HungryMrCrunk.
6481000	6483000	Was that typed on a PSP?
6483000	6485000	I don't know. This is Hungrymercrunk.
6485000	6488000	Or your OLR member, Columbia99.
6488000	6491000	What was the question?
6491000	6493000	There's only two periods in this whole thing.
6493000	6495000	Should it get a PSP 3000?
6495000	6496000	No.
6496000	6498000	Not when you know that this PSP Go is on the horizon.
6498000	6499000	I don't think so.
6499000	6500000	And the PSP 3000...
6500000	6501000	I wouldn't get either.
6501000	6506000	The PSP 3000 really only had just the microphone built in, basically.
6506000	6508000	Seriously? Why?
6508000	6513000	If you really love your PSP, then wait for the PSP Go.
6513000	6516000	But if you already have a couple PSPs, which it sounds like you do,
6516000	6517000	I don't see the point.
6517000	6521000	Again, this PSP Go is not going to have any additional hardware to it
6521000	6522000	that we know of so far.
6522000	6524000	I mean, granted, they might come out and say something at E3.
6524000	6526000	Sure. Buy one. Help the economy.
6526000	6527000	Well, I love how they're all,
6527000	6529000	oh, well, we don't want to add another analog stick to it
6529000	6533000	because then that'll make certain games incompatible.
6533000	6534000	You're making them all download anyways,
6534000	6536000	so they're going to be incompatible with whatever.
6536000	6538000	You know, just have...
6538000	6540000	I'd say add the second analog stick
6540000	6542000	and that way you can actually do proper emulation
6542000	6547000	on some of these older PlayStation 1 games.
6547000	6549000	All right.
6549000	6551000	So, take our advice or leave it.
6551000	6553000	Buy one and help the economy.
6553000	6555000	Ain't my money, so I don't care.
6555000	6557000	Send your money to me.
6557000	6558000	Send your money to me, now.
6558000	6560000	I'll stimulate the economy.
6560000	6562000	Oh, I bet you will.
6562000	6564000	Anyway.
6564000	6566000	Hey, OLR Peepshizzles.
6566000	6567000	Okay.
6567000	6571000	With all the rumors about the PSP 2 or whatever Sony will call it,
6571000	6573000	I was wondering what are your top three features
6573000	6575000	that you want for it.
6575000	6577000	Ooh, this could be a list list.
6577000	6579000	I personally would like a larger screen
6579000	6581000	and separate mini USB device that allows you
6581000	6584000	to load your UMD games onto it for playing games
6584000	6586000	that you already own without switching disks.
6586000	6589000	Also, I would love dual analog sticks.
6589000	6592000	Much love, someone who dearly loves old people.
6592000	6593000	Wait a minute.
6593000	6594000	Didn't we already hear from somebody like that?
6594000	6596000	Yes, we did.
6596000	6597000	I'm sorry.
6597000	6599000	I got kicked from IRC in the middle of that question.
6599000	6601000	Top three features for the PSP Go?
6601000	6606000	Yeah, that you would want to see.
6606000	6609000	I want a Tic Tac dispenser.
6609000	6611000	Made of bacon?
6611000	6612000	No, no.
6612000	6614000	I want orange Tic Tacs.
6614000	6618000	I don't know.
6618000	6620000	Because they're not going to do much
6620000	6622000	that they're not already doing with the PSP,
6622000	6624000	it's so hard to say.
6624000	6627000	Dude, they may as well add a phone unit on that thing.
6627000	6628000	It looks like one anyway.
6628000	6631000	The number one thing I want to see
6631000	6633000	is I want to make sure it's easy
6633000	6635000	to download the games and get them on.
6635000	6637000	I want to see integration with my PC.
6637000	6640000	I want to see something that when I plug this thing into my PC,
6640000	6643000	it has a cool little front-end system like iTunes.
6643000	6645000	And I got criticized for that earlier by somebody in chat
6645000	6646000	saying iTunes isn't that great.
6646000	6647000	And they're actually right.
6647000	6649000	iTunes is not that great,
6649000	6651000	but it still makes managing the device a lot easier
6651000	6653000	than if you didn't have something like that at all.
6653000	6656000	I'm talking about something pretty for stupid people
6656000	6660000	that will allow me to manage the content on my PSP.
6660000	6662000	That's what I would like more than anything.
6662000	6664000	Dude, a soccer ball!
6664000	6666000	Are you watching Loki playing?
6666000	6668000	Yeah, I was watching Loki play because he's a soccer ball.
6668000	6669000	Well, that's my idea.
6669000	6671000	Loki, do you have anything?
6671000	6676000	Touch screen would be nice.
6676000	6678000	A better web browser.
6678000	6680000	And...
6680000	6681000	Pagle.
6681000	6682000	More RAM.
6682000	6684000	Actually, I think they should add more RAM to it.
6684000	6688000	Who cares? Just add a more beefy web browser, more RAM,
6688000	6690000	and...
6690000	6691000	Yeah.
6691000	6693000	Touch screen would be nice.
6693000	6694000	Xlink in chat says porn.
6694000	6696000	PSP needs more porn.
6696000	6697000	There's plenty of porn out there.
6697000	6699000	And plus you can convert it all.
6699000	6701000	Well, plus the thing gets on the internet, right?
6701000	6702000	That's all the porn you need right there.
6702000	6704000	Exactly. That's why you need a better web browser.
6704000	6707000	It should have a GPS.
6707000	6708000	That might be neat.
6708000	6711000	And it should have...
6711000	6714000	It should have a Tic Tac dispenser and Altoid dispenser.
6714000	6716000	And apps like the iPhone.
6716000	6717000	Open-end development.
6717000	6718000	And the Tamagotchi.
6718000	6720000	That's on my list, too. Open-end development.
6720000	6725000	It should have the little tiger games on there like football.
6725000	6727000	And all those games.
6727000	6729000	Alright, we've given more than three.
6729000	6730000	This listener should be satisfied.
6730000	6732000	Okay.
6732000	6735000	Dear God, whoever wrote a novel...
6735000	6736000	Oh, that's act deft.
6736000	6738000	Okay.
6738000	6744000	Hi, OLR. This is your friendly and swine flu free neighborhood Mexican act deft.
6744000	6748000	Can I just say, swine flu, what the hell?
6748000	6750000	People need to stop it.
6750000	6753000	Stop it with the swine flu garbage.
6753000	6756000	More people die from lots of other things.
6756000	6758000	Like, oh my God.
6758000	6761000	And I'll admit at first, if you go back and read my Twitter,
6761000	6765000	at first I was kind of like, eh, because I was worried that it was actually going to be an outbreak.
6765000	6769000	But like, you know what, more people die from the regular flu.
6769000	6772000	It's not as big of a deal as people were making it out to be in the beginning.
6772000	6774000	Knock it off.
6774000	6777000	And you can eat pork and not get swine flu, by the way.
6777000	6787000	It made me want to cry when there was an actual caption on CNN saying you do not get swine flu from eating pig.
6787000	6790000	I just think it's an excuse for people to use swine in everyday conversation.
6790000	6791000	True story.
6791000	6796000	My uncle is a pig farmer out in Elk Grove, just south of Elk Grove, has a big pig farm.
6796000	6800000	He's been on the news twice this week because apparently, I never knew this before,
6800000	6803000	he's the president of the National Pork Board, who knew there was one,
6803000	6806000	and he's talking about how this is hurting business.
6806000	6810000	They've lost 20% of business since the swine flu thing came out.
6810000	6812000	I'm going to go get pork chops.
6812000	6813000	There you go.
6813000	6817000	He actually said on the news, if people will just eat a pork chop a week and some bacon, we'll all be fine.
6817000	6822000	I'm thinking in the back of my head, boy, Loki's probably sitting there watching this going, no problem.
6822000	6824000	I'm not sitting there watching. I'm eating pork.
6824000	6833000	I think all our listeners, unless you are Muslim or Jewish or any other religion that doesn't allow you to eat pork.
6833000	6834000	Or vegetarian or whatever.
6834000	6836000	Or vegetarian, whatever.
6836000	6839000	Go to your local IHOP and order a bacon platter.
6839000	6841000	That's right. Please help keep my uncle in business.
6841000	6842000	Go get some bacon right now.
6842000	6843000	Go get some bacon.
6843000	6845000	Unless, you know, Jewish, whatever.
6845000	6852000	Everyone get together and just do the bacon march and hold up banners that say, bacon does not give you swine flu. Eat up.
6852000	6853000	Bacon is meat candy.
6853000	6855000	H1N1 be damned.
6855000	6856000	I heart bacon.
6856000	6859000	Bacon is meat candy.
6859000	6862000	I need a shirt for ASEN that says I heart bacon.
6862000	6863000	Can I get that quickly?
6863000	6864000	I bet you could.
6864000	6866000	I have a shirt that says I heart bacon.
6866000	6867000	Can I borrow it for ASEN?
6867000	6868000	No.
6868000	6869000	Oh, damn you.
6869000	6871000	That, of course, was only half one.
6871000	6872000	All right.
6872000	6874000	I'll figure it out.
6874000	6875000	Hi, OLR.
6875000	6878000	This is your, okay, I already read that part.
6878000	6884000	As we may already know, Harmonics is going to release some rock band games to expand the franchise.
6884000	6887000	Though what I don't get is why people are bitching and whining about it.
6887000	6893000	First of all, all those that are saying that Harmonics is trying to milk the franchise and are going the way of Activision.
6893000	6898000	Look at all the Guitar Hero games that have been released and all those to come in the near future.
6898000	6903000	Guitar Hero Metallica, Smash Hits, Van Halen, On Tour Decades, and the Arcade Game.
6903000	6904000	Just to name a few.
6904000	6907000	By the way, the movie theater had a Guitar Hero arcade.
6907000	6908000	Just thought I'd let you know.
6908000	6912000	Now look at what Harmonics has released or will release at the same time span.
6912000	6917000	ACDC tracks, Unplugged, The Beatles, Lego Rock Band, and that's it.
6917000	6921000	Guitar Hero has overloaded the market while Rock Band is expanding its current market.
6921000	6928000	Not to mention that you can export tracks and play DLC in whatever rock band game with no problem except for The Beatles and Unplugged.
6928000	6930000	And we don't know about Lego yet.
6930000	6935000	While with Guitar Hero you have to own every disc to be able to play every song you have on them.
6935000	6939000	Not to mention changing discs every time you want to play a song that's on another disc.
6939000	6944000	Yes, I know this isn't a problem for some, but it's still something that would be more quick and useful.
6944000	6946000	Excuse me.
6946000	6952000	To top it off, people are also asking, why Rock Band Unplugged on the PSP?
6952000	6954000	Where's the reason on that?
6954000	6962000	Well, the reason is that if they had more info on it, they would know it is a spiritual sequel to frequency and amplitude made by Harmonics nonetheless.
6962000	6970000	No instruments, just press the buttons and according to what the track is, and of course, according to the rhythm.
6970000	6974000	And the new songs featured on it will be on the Rock Band music store for consoles.
6974000	6983000	Also, Unplugged will have its own music score, not like Guitar Hero on tour, in which you need the peripheral to play and you can't play on tour on your DSI.
6983000	6991000	And not to mention the awkwardness when you're playing it with N-Node DLC, whatever. Sorry, whatsoever.
6991000	6995000	To sum it all up, Rock Band is not turning into Guitar Hero. Stop bitching about it.
6995000	6999000	Harmonics knows what they're doing. That was all in caps, but I feel like screaming.
6999000	7003000	Sorry if this email is a long F you rant, but I need to get it off my chest.
7003000	7006000	Thanks for reading and for listening to your listeners.
7006000	7008000	Smile face!
7008000	7010000	Happy face!
7010000	7014000	You just, you did the smiley, my favorite smiley. Okay.
7014000	7020000	I agree that Rock Band isn't milking as bad as Guitar Hero, but I worry that it might be going that direction.
7020000	7024000	If this Lego thing will not let you import songs, I'm going to be very disappointed.
7024000	7026000	It's not going to, it's a different publisher.
7026000	7027000	I think that's the only reason-
7027000	7029000	Oh my god, my mic wasn't on, I'm sorry.
7029000	7034000	I was going to say, if this Rock Band will not let you import songs, I'm going to be very disappointed, this Lego one.
7034000	7036000	I don't think Rock Band has jumped the shark as bad as Guitar Hero.
7036000	7040000	I'd be surprised if they let you. I think there's going to be too many problems because it's a different publisher.
7040000	7042000	But if it were the same publisher, I'm sure they would let you.
7042000	7045000	Same with the Beatles thing. The Beatles thing, they have a special deal there.
7045000	7047000	It's, you know, Beatles only.
7047000	7054000	If they come out with a Rock Band 3, you better believe all that stuff from the other games are going to be, you know, able to be dumped into there.
7054000	7056000	And you never know, they made surprises with Lego Rock Band.
7056000	7059000	Maybe they signed some sort of deal that, you know, you can do that.
7059000	7061000	Maybe you pay, like, so much money and those songs get dumped in there.
7061000	7065000	I highly doubt it because it's a different publisher, though.
7065000	7068000	But once again, those are optional. You don't need to buy them.
7068000	7079000	Whereas, you know, and as we mentioned earlier in Part A, the amount of content they're releasing per week is matching what Guitar Hero is releasing per month.
7079000	7081000	That's pretty sad.
7081000	7085000	And in place, you're getting these standalone games that you have to spend $60 for.
7085000	7087000	No thanks.
7087000	7090000	But once again, those are optional, too, so.
7090000	7096000	Well, also, I want to make a comment, though, about emails. Henceforth, unless I feel, you know, otherwise at the moment.
7096000	7101000	If I get any more emails during the show, I'm probably not going to read them until next week.
7101000	7105000	So, you may as well just understand that.
7105000	7107000	Yep, good idea.
7107000	7109000	Anyway, last email comes from Cheeseburger.
7109000	7124000	Hey guys, sometimes you talk about how you need to stop getting on random tangents. Well, I would just like to say that I would not listen to OLR if not for the personality from each host. Random food, news, and political talk are just random tangents about randomness.
7124000	7126000	I've never seen random news so much in a sentence before.
7126000	7130000	Anyway, that's what makes OLR different from other video game shows.
7130000	7138000	Just, I'm not in the mood for just straight, sometimes I'm not in the mood for just straight video game news. Sometimes I want a good laugh. Keep on podcasting.
7138000	7142000	Keep in mind that the bitching about tangents is also part of what makes the show the show.
7142000	7143000	Yeah.
7143000	7145000	So, it all goes hand in hand.
7145000	7151000	Brought to you by Halo 3, home of the never-ending four-year-old rocket noobs.
7151000	7153000	It's over!
7153000	7160000	Alright, we're done with the mailbag. That was Mailbag at OrangeLongTrader.com if you want to participate in the future.
7160000	7161000	There you go.
7161000	7167000	By the way, Bobby is typing a monologue in chat right now about the whole Rock Band import.
7167000	7171000	About the Rock Band import songs, you did not import songs from ACDC.
7171000	7175000	They gave you a DLC code and you downloaded the songs from Xbox Live or Playstation Network.
7175000	7177000	You did not rip them from the disc like Rock Band 1.
7177000	7181000	You never had to put the ACDC disc in your 360 to get the ACDC code.
7181000	7183000	You just needed the code in the manual.
7183000	7190000	That's why I don't buy the it's a different developer excuse, because ACDC Rock Band was developed by a different developer as well.
7190000	7193000	I wasn't saying different developer, I'm saying different publisher.
7193000	7198000	That's the deal there. I mean, the developer doesn't really matter if it's going to be in the same series.
7198000	7201000	It's just like Guitar Hero has been developed by a bunch of different people.
7201000	7205000	I mean, it's been harmonics for a lot of it, but then now they have...
7205000	7209000	I don't remember the last developer doing the new one.
7209000	7210000	For Guitar Hero? Neversoft.
7210000	7211000	Neversoft, yeah.
7211000	7215000	So, yeah, it's not developer, it's publisher.
7215000	7218000	And because it's a different publisher, it's not EA.
7218000	7225000	If EA was putting it out, then yeah, I'm sure they could do some sort of way to port that stuff over.
7225000	7230000	But because it's Warner, it's a little different. I don't know.
7230000	7232000	But also because it's Warner, it may have some good music in it.
7232000	7235000	Because, I mean, they do have the Warner music license.
7235000	7237000	True.
7239000	7244000	Anyways, kind of a completely off the topic of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
7244000	7249000	One versus 100. You may remember that they kind of teased this actually last E3.
7249000	7255000	When they were showing the brand new Xbox interface.
7255000	7263000	Now, of course, the first primetime game that they're going to be launching is One versus 100.
7263000	7265000	And it's going to be available for gold members.
7265000	7267000	So you have to have a gold membership in order to play.
7267000	7270000	Which makes sense because it's an online game.
7270000	7274000	And they want to drive more members to sign up for it.
7274000	7278000	So they have a little teaser trailer for it.
7278000	7281000	And, of course, you're going to be able to play with your avatars.
7281000	7288000	Play as part of the mob or the person actually playing the show or as the audience.
7288000	7290000	So that looks kind of cool.
7290000	7292000	And they're going to be doing where you can win real prizes.
7292000	7294000	So, I mean, sounds like fun.
7294000	7296000	How do they pick the person that's going to be the one?
7296000	7297000	I don't know.
7297000	7298000	That's interesting.
7298000	7300000	I'm curious to see how this is going to work.
7300000	7305000	Because there's going to be thousands upon thousands of people that want to do this.
7305000	7306000	You know what I mean?
7306000	7311000	So they're going to have to have some type of selection process to be the one or even to be one of the folks in the mob.
7311000	7312000	You know what I mean?
7312000	7313000	Yeah.
7313000	7315000	It's going to be interesting to see how this works.
7315000	7317000	Unless they have multiple sessions going at one time.
7317000	7321000	But even then, each game is supposed to have their own individual host, right?
7321000	7322000	Yeah.
7322000	7326000	So it'll be interesting to see how it works.
7326000	7329000	But I'm sure we'll see more about it at E3.
7329000	7331000	Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see more about it, too.
7331000	7333000	You think it's not going to release to the network before E3?
7333000	7334000	It might, actually.
7334000	7336000	Because this was becoming this month, I thought.
7336000	7337000	That's what I thought, too.
7337000	7338000	Or last month, April, wasn't it?
7338000	7339000	No, it was May.
7339000	7341000	Oh, May. Interesting.
7341000	7344000	So maybe we'll see it just before E3 and we'll hear about the next game show at E3.
7344000	7345000	Yeah, maybe.
7345000	7350000	Or maybe they're going to hold it off until June and announce some more stuff at E3.
7350000	7353000	I'm afraid of embarrassing myself with my lack of knowledge.
7353000	7357000	Here's my question. How are they going to prevent people from having a laptop right next to them googling all the answers?
7357000	7358000	I don't know.
7358000	7359000	That's what I want to know.
7359000	7363000	Because one of the questions they show off in the trailer, they're all, you know,
7363000	7366000	the director of 300 also directed what other movie?
7366000	7369000	And it's like, you know, Watchmen.
7369000	7372000	They gave two other ones, like, really?
7372000	7374000	You don't know who.
7374000	7375000	Some people wouldn't.
7375000	7378000	A lot of people wouldn't.
7378000	7379000	Nerds do.
7379000	7380000	Yes.
7380000	7381000	But other people don't.
7381000	7383000	No, seriously, you could totally Google that stuff.
7383000	7387000	Unless you're going to be given, like, a certain time limit or something.
7387000	7389000	Because it's not going to be like the TV show where you can just sit there going,
7389000	7392000	Umm, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh.
7392000	7395000	Tigerclaw says, Didn't 1 vs. 100 get cancelled on TV?
7395000	7396000	Yes, it did.
7396000	7400000	SHJ100Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangeonshooter.com says,
7400000	7405000	You were also scored on time, so they can Google it, but they will get a crappy score.
7405000	7406000	Interesting.
7406000	7408000	How's that guy going to play into it on 1 vs. 100?
7408000	7411000	I guess I'm going to have to see how it kind of looks.
7411000	7413000	So, there you go.
7413000	7417000	Alright, well, hey, that's not the only game coming out in the future.
7417000	7418000	Moving on over to the Wii.
7418000	7420000	The Wii has a very interesting game coming out.
7420000	7422000	It's actually coming out from Sega.
7422000	7424000	It's called The Wacky World of Sports.
7424000	7428000	Because, you know, we didn't have any sports games on the Wii as it is already.
7428000	7431000	However, yeah, what's awesome about this,
7431000	7435000	Sega, I guess, has released this trailer for it, The Wacky World of Sports.
7435000	7440000	Furniture racing, card boxing, log cutting, mud sliding,
7440000	7446000	tuna tossing, cheese rolling, and extreme ironing.
7446000	7448000	These are all real sports, too.
7448000	7449000	What?
7449000	7451000	These are all real sports from around the world.
7451000	7452000	Cheese rolling, yeah.
7452000	7455000	I think I've heard of cheese rolling, but tuna tossing?
7455000	7456000	That sounds dirty.
7456000	7459000	That's like toss your cookies.
7459000	7460000	That's from New Zealand, I think.
7460000	7461000	New Zealand?
7461000	7462000	It's from Australia. It's one of those.
7462000	7464000	Are they going to have an event for tossing your salad?
7464000	7468000	No, that's not a sport.
7468000	7470000	For some it is.
7470000	7472000	I'm afraid to say it's not a sport.
7472000	7475000	It's just like DDR will never be a sport.
7475000	7476000	For some it's a sport.
7476000	7478000	Tossing your salad would be a hobby.
7478000	7480000	They don't have any leagues for that, okay?
7480000	7481000	I'm sorry.
7481000	7485000	Well, maybe someone should start one.
7485000	7488000	Yeah, that'd be a big step backwards there.
7488000	7490000	I'm just looking forward to extreme ironing.
7490000	7494000	How is that a sport?
7494000	7495000	I don't know.
7495000	7497000	How is it not a sport, Rob, huh?
7497000	7498000	I don't know.
7498000	7502000	I could say instead of get back to work, get back to training.
7502000	7503000	I'm looking at the trailer here, by the way.
7503000	7506000	If you want to know what the noise is, you hear in the background.
7506000	7507000	Wow.
7507000	7508000	That guy looks like Naruto.
7508000	7509000	He does.
7509000	7511000	That car just fell apart.
7511000	7513000	Like Naruto and Wario had a baby.
7513000	7514000	I think it was towards the end here.
7514000	7517000	Yeah, the guy's doing the tuna tossing.
7517000	7518000	I've seen that.
7518000	7519000	I've seen the cheese rolling.
7519000	7522000	That I've seen before.
7522000	7527000	But then they have the extreme ironing here towards the end, which I just did not recognize
7527000	7528000	at all.
7528000	7530000	I was like, what the hell is this?
7530000	7531000	But they had it.
7531000	7537000	It was someone else that was covering the same story had where that came from.
7537000	7543000	Actually, I think if you click on some of the links there, they have links to Wikipedia
7543000	7544000	pages.
7544000	7545000	But I think tuna tossing.
7545000	7549000	Well, here, let me just go to Wikipedia.
7549000	7551000	No, I guess so.
7551000	7554000	Yeah, there's a whole little article here on extreme ironing.
7554000	7558000	A performance art in which people take an ironing board to a remote location and iron
7558000	7561000	items of clothing.
7561000	7564000	The latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with
7564000	7567000	the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt.
7567000	7575000	And then, oh my God, there's this person ironing on top of a big rock in the middle of fucking
7575000	7576000	nowhere.
7576000	7578000	This is amazing.
7578000	7581000	I didn't know shit like this existed in the world.
7581000	7582000	Rob.
7582000	7583000	I want to do this.
7583000	7585000	Everything exists.
7585000	7588000	I could be an extreme ironer.
7588000	7592000	All I have to do is climb the fucking rock and then iron a shirt at the top of that.
7592000	7593000	That's easy.
7593000	7597000	I do my ironing in a rotating cylindrical container with heat.
7597000	7598000	You know what that's called?
7598000	7602000	My dryer.
7602000	7604000	Wow, that's pretty cool.
7604000	7606000	How about something else that has to do with rolling, Rob?
7606000	7609000	They call them ironists.
7609000	7610000	How about more rolling?
7610000	7611000	All right, fine.
7611000	7614000	Rolling and rolling.
7614000	7617000	What is our favorite thing to roll ever?
7617000	7619000	Cheese?
7619000	7620000	Sushi?
7620000	7621000	Cheese.
7621000	7622000	Money.
7622000	7624000	How about Katamari?
7624000	7625000	Yay.
7625000	7629000	Oh yes, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we love Katamari.
7629000	7630000	Rob.
7630000	7631000	Rob.
7631000	7632000	What?
7632000	7633000	Rob.
7633000	7634000	Rob.
7634000	7635000	Rob.
7635000	7636000	What?
7636000	7637000	Rob.
7637000	7638000	You're scaring me.
7638000	7640000	Read your damn story.
7640000	7645000	Yeah, apparently Spike TV actually has, they do Wild World of Spike and it has, you know,
7645000	7647000	all these different things like tuna.
7647000	7650000	They have the tuna toss outtakes.
7650000	7654000	It's from South Australia.
7654000	7660000	Sorry, I had to have commentary.
7660000	7665000	Katamari is going to be on PS3 with Katamari Forever, which I believe we might have mentioned
7665000	7666000	before.
7666000	7668000	We mentioned the Japanese one, yeah.
7668000	7674000	Well, there's a trailer out with different wild animals making commentary on it.
7674000	7679000	The cool thing is that it's going to have different features available for it as far
7679000	7680000	as visual filters.
7680000	7687000	You get a wood grain, a cell shaded, a color pencil, and then the normal version.
7687000	7694000	Also, this of course has no involvement from Keita Takahashi.
7694000	7699000	But what I got from watching the trailer is that you're actually going to be able to,
7699000	7705000	well, roll up entire planets and roll up the universe.
7705000	7707000	So, that's kind of interesting.
7707000	7710000	I saw it rolling up, you know, the earth.
7710000	7712000	It was pretty crazy.
7712000	7715000	Didn't they swear there was not going to be any more Katamari games?
7715000	7719000	I guess that was really the original creator, but now that Namco Bandai owns this franchise.
7719000	7720000	Well, this is the best of it.
7720000	7721000	It's not new.
7721000	7722000	It's just taking the levels from the other game.
7722000	7724000	It's still milk in the cash cow.
7724000	7725000	There's actually...
7725000	7726000	Any way you want to slice it.
7726000	7728000	Looking at the trailers, there's new levels.
7728000	7735000	There actually shows one where you're rolling the Katamari and planting flowers and plants
7735000	7737000	on a desert.
7737000	7741000	I just think that series kind of peaked on the PlayStation 2.
7741000	7743000	Like, I did not like that one they released on the 360 at all.
7743000	7744000	It's almost like it's going to be fun.
7744000	7746000	Eh, we'll see.
7746000	7747000	We'll see.
7747000	7749000	But do you know what else I'd like to roll, Dark Sakura?
7749000	7751000	Because you were asking about things we like to roll.
7751000	7752000	Do you know what else I'd like to roll?
7752000	7754000	I don't need to know about your illegal activities, Rob.
7754000	7770000	No, I just wanted to tell you one other thing I like to roll.
7770000	7773000	I'm successful at life, thank you very much.
7773000	7774000	Yes.
7774000	7776000	You win the game.
7776000	7778000	I just won the game.
7778000	7783000	I mean, I know a lot of people lose the game, but they never talk about how somebody wins
7783000	7785000	the game, and I just won it.
7785000	7787000	So, there's no need to play the game anymore.
7787000	7788000	I won.
7788000	7789000	The end.
7789000	7790000	I thought about you winning the game.
7790000	7792000	See, you didn't think about it.
7792000	7793000	So I guess I would.
7793000	7795000	That's right.
7795000	7797000	So, yeah.
7797000	7801000	Lots of interesting stuff going on.
7801000	7807000	Including, Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe is actually coming to the PSP.
7807000	7810000	You know, we've been talking about a lot of different games coming to the PSP.
7810000	7817000	This might be the year of the PSP, although last year was supposedly the year of the PSP
7817000	7818000	as well.
7818000	7821000	Of course, it wasn't quite a year for the PSP, but whatever.
7821000	7823000	We'll give it another shot.
7823000	7824000	Take two.
7824000	7827000	Anyways, Pixel Junk Monsters Deluxe coming to the PSP.
7827000	7834000	They're going to have some new stages, new enemies, new tracks, or music tracks.
7834000	7838000	Two new towers will also be introduced to the game as well, but it's basically going
7838000	7845000	to feature the same stuff, including trophies from the original PSN game.
7845000	7847000	So that's kind of cool.
7847000	7849000	Everyone loves their tower defense games.
7849000	7852000	I guess, although they've kind of been jumping the shark as of late.
7852000	7856000	It seems like they all have one, especially the Final Fantasy tower defense game.
7856000	7858000	Although it's kind of fun, I've got to say.
7858000	7860000	That's on every system.
7860000	7863000	Pixel Junk and so on and so on.
7863000	7865000	I don't know.
7865000	7868000	Well, obviously Swine Flu has been all the rage this week.
7868000	7870000	I can't believe I'm reading this story.
7870000	7872000	But Swine Flu has been all the rage this week.
7872000	7876000	But did you know that Swine Flu has actually existed in the World of Warcraft
7876000	7878000	for quite some time?
7878000	7879000	That's right.
7879000	7882000	World of Warcraft has seen the Swine Flu for a little while now,
7882000	7884000	ever since they released Wrath of the Lich King.
7884000	7889000	It's these pigs in Borean Chandra, which is in the new area of Northren.
7889000	7892000	If you attack these pigs, you have a chance of getting infected.
7892000	7896000	And if you get infected with the Swine Flu, your movement speed drops by 30%,
7896000	7900000	and you get hit with 120 natural damage every two seconds.
7900000	7903000	So if you happen to catch the Swine Flu in Warcraft this week,
7903000	7905000	it's not a joke that was put in there by the developers.
7905000	7908000	It's something that's been there the entire time.
7908000	7910000	So stop bitching if you get it.
7910000	7913000	So it's really Blizzard that has caused the Swine Flu.
7913000	7915000	Yes, it was Blizzard's fault all along.
7915000	7919000	And the fact that I'm even talking about this story makes me cry inside a little bit.
7919000	7922000	And when I get hurt by the stories that we read,
7922000	7925000	that makes us very angsty, and that's when the FUs of the Week happen.
7941000	7943000	DarkSakura, your FUs of the Week, please.
7943000	7947000	My FU goes to Citrus Heights cops, just in general,
7947000	7950000	they really like to find reasons to give you a ticket.
7950000	7955000	I had one tailgating me, well, practically tailgating me on the way here,
7955000	7958000	I guess waiting for me to speed or something,
7958000	7962000	and thankfully someone decided to jaywalk right in front of us,
7962000	7966000	so the cop turned on the sirens and got the jaywalker.
7966000	7972000	Still, a bit, I don't know if you have enough to do or something.
7972000	7978000	Logi! Yeah, FU goes to, I guess, police as well.
7978000	7982000	It's kind of funny though, you see them turn on their sirens or whatever,
7982000	7986000	and see who pulls over to the side and they give them a ticket.
7986000	7989000	I'm not sure why, you know, not necessarily people speeding,
7989000	7994000	but people think that they want to pull over and then they get a ticket for some reason.
7994000	7999000	I don't get a ticket though, because I can see them sitting there.
7999000	8001000	That's it.
8001000	8003000	Am I the only one that doesn't have police issues this week?
8003000	8010000	Well, I didn't really have anything other than driving to Oakland sucks.
8010000	8015000	FU did the fact that everything seems to close at like 10 o'clock in this city.
8015000	8018000	Like, I was out in Roseville last night trying to find some late night eats
8018000	8023000	and everything was freaking closed, so FU did stores that close early.
8023000	8025000	It's annoying. Oh, I'm sorry, Logi.
8025000	8033000	FU did the finale of Heroes. It sucked, and what they did with the villain in the series is retarded.
8033000	8037000	Interesting. I'm eight episodes behind on Heroes. I kind of gave up.
8037000	8041000	You're gonna... Don't expect a good finale.
8041000	8045000	Oh, great. Maybe I'll watch it during the summer. We'll see. I'll catch up at some point.
8045000	8049000	Alright, FU to Logi for not finishing his FUs, and I get my FU early.
8049000	8055000	Alright, that's it for the FUs of the week. No guests tonight to keep the segment going,
8055000	8059000	so we've got a little more news, about four more stories for you guys,
8059000	8063000	and then we are going to get into your Skype calls and some last minute stories.
8063000	8067000	1-877-GAME-OLR, but not yet. We have a few more stories. Talk Sakura.
8067000	8076000	Well, there is a teaser that was put out on the Pokemon Sunday TV show that's on TV course in Japan,
8076000	8082000	and they were saying that there would be a remake of Pokemon Gold and Silver.
8082000	8088000	This said that they would have a world exclusive first announcement on the 10th of May,
8088000	8098000	so maybe that's it. It could be a rumor, but they were showing gold and silver confetti balls,
8098000	8102000	so that could possibly be it.
8102000	8108000	I didn't want to see their gold balls. Wherever they can milk for money, they will.
8108000	8112000	Ooh, Scorpion.
8112000	8116000	You've got to put the game down, Logi.
8116000	8120000	You can watch Logi play Excitebots in between stories at our Justin TV channel,
8120000	8124000	www.justin.tv slash orange lounge radio.
8124000	8135000	Also, keeping on topic with more PSP games, Naruto Shippuden is putting a brand new fighting game
8135000	8140000	following that series. Coming to the PSP, it actually kind of resembles the Naruto game
8140000	8144000	that came out on the PS3 last year, which is not a bad thing at all,
8144000	8146000	because that game was pretty awesome looking.
8146000	8154000	But, Naruto Shippuden Legends Akatsuki Rising.
8154000	8160000	I guess it's going to feature a simplified control scheme that will allow players to easily create ultimate combos.
8160000	8166000	I don't know, it looks kind of cool, but definitely they have a pretty solid lineup for PSP games this year,
8166000	8171000	so more power to them, because they have a lot of catching up to do.
8171000	8181000	Is this related to all the other Naruto games in the world?
8181000	8187000	Shippuden is basically what people are referring to as the time jump.
8187000	8191000	He's a little bit older, but they've been doing the Shippuden games,
8191000	8194000	like they did Ultimate Ninja 4, which is Shippuden,
8194000	8202000	and then they have a new Shippuden game for the DS that's coming out next month, I think.
8202000	8207000	This one's going to be another fighting game, because they've been doing PSP, Naruto Ultimate Ninja games,
8207000	8216000	like the Ultimate Ninja Heroes series, but now, going along with the whole Shippuden stuff, why not?
8216000	8218000	It looks pretty good.
8218000	8222000	Alright, well, a couple more new games that are coming out in the future.
8222000	8224000	This is going to be coming out on the DS this winter.
8224000	8228000	If you're a fan of the Phoenix Wright series, which I guess you could really call the Ace Attorney series,
8228000	8232000	there's a new game coming out called Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.
8232000	8234000	It's not going to be like the other games.
8234000	8238000	This is more about investigating the crime scene, not so much in the courtroom.
8238000	8245000	You're actually going to become Miles Edgeworth, and you're going to investigate crime scenes, trying to find the truth.
8245000	8247000	So it's a weird CSI type thing.
8247000	8251000	I guess. You're actually going to be on the crime scene as Edgeworth, looking for contradictions.
8251000	8256000	You identify clues and question material using logic and gathered evidence.
8256000	8258000	Of course, there are several episodes in this game as well.
8258000	8263000	The first one is a murder that happens in Edgeworth's office. Interesting.
8263000	8269000	By the way, this game is teen rated, and it's supposed to have 15 hours' worth of gameplay.
8269000	8273000	So I'm sure those of you that are fans of the Ace Attorney series will be happy about that,
8273000	8276000	although the game is going in a little bit of a different direction this time.
8276000	8278000	Hopefully not for the bad.
8278000	8286000	Well, speaking of bad as in badass, Raven Software is actually wanting to make a particular game since they've been...
8286000	8290000	And of course, they were the ones that made the X-Men Origins Wolverine game.
8290000	8292000	They want to do a Deadpool game.
8292000	8294000	They really want to do a Deadpool game, it says.
8294000	8306000	And actually, their project lead for the Wolverine game, Dan Von Drak, said that they really want to do it because of Deadpool's smartass attitude.
8306000	8312000	And if they made one, I will buy it on every platform. Just watch.
8312000	8314000	Just on principle alone, even though it might suck?
8314000	8321000	Well, if the X-Men Origins game was pretty good, then I would expect them to give the Deadpool game a good treatment.
8321000	8324000	So, hey, I'm feeling good about that.
8324000	8329000	Now, do we have any word yet on whether you will be able to break the fourth wall in this game?
8329000	8333000	You have to. It won't be a Deadpool game if you don't break the fourth wall.
8333000	8336000	There should be a button to smash the fourth wall.
8336000	8339000	He should know he's in a video game.
8339000	8342000	So, it's gonna be like, eat lead?
8342000	8346000	Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know. But that's the big thing about Deadpool, like comic people.
8346000	8353000	I did not know this. I actually read up on Deadpool after seeing the Wolverine movie to figure out why Jamie was so obsessed with Deadpool.
8353000	8356000	And I get it now. Like, it sounds like a very Jamie thing from what I read.
8356000	8360000	I'm gonna have to just send you some images that you'll know.
8360000	8365000	You saw the little yellow boxes picture. That's like Ultimate right there.
8365000	8371000	But, by the way, the article that I'm reading actually did compare what they imagined as being like, eat lead.
8371000	8372000	Nice.
8372000	8376000	Alright, well, guess what? It's that time of the show where we're gonna take your phone calls.
8376000	8379000	And the phones are already ringing in a 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8379000	8382000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, so let's go to the phones.
8382000	8384000	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio. Who's this?
8384000	8386000	Hey, it's been a while since I've been on here.
8386000	8388000	It has been a little while. Who is this?
8388000	8390000	Hey, it's DJ Rama S from New York.
8390000	8394000	Now, see, I knew that, but I always make people introduce themselves for the sake of new listeners.
8394000	8397000	Well, what's on your mind, DJ Rama S from New York?
8397000	8402000	Not too much. I have a couple questions, but first, Loki, congratulations.
8402000	8404000	Thank you.
8404000	8405000	You're welcome.
8405000	8410000	You weren't able to get through last week when, of course, it was announced that Loki's looking at twins in the future.
8410000	8412000	Fun, fun.
8412000	8413000	Yeah.
8413000	8414000	So, what's up?
8414000	8421000	My only qualm was about Konami canceling Six Days in Fallujah.
8421000	8423000	That's my only beef.
8423000	8425000	What's your problem with it?
8425000	8427000	This is the way I look at it.
8427000	8432000	If it's okay to have various World War II simulating fighting games,
8432000	8436000	I don't see how that's any different from Six Days in Fallujah,
8436000	8439000	or that's any different from the America's Army game.
8439000	8442000	I mean, they're all more or less based on real-time events.
8442000	8444000	But it's too soon.
8444000	8446000	People we know died there. It's too soon.
8446000	8448000	It's too soon for this.
8448000	8450000	The wounds are too fresh.
8450000	8453000	I applied the Dennis Leary quote to this.
8453000	8456000	Shut the fuck up, by Dr. Dennis Leary.
8456000	8457000	I agree.
8457000	8458000	I'm just being devil's advocate here.
8458000	8461000	I don't say I necessarily believe this, but what do you say to those people?
8461000	8463000	Besides, shut the fuck up.
8463000	8467000	You can't say that to, you know, somebody who's, I guess maybe you can,
8467000	8469000	but it's not a very nice thing to say.
8469000	8471000	I mean, is there anything else to say besides?
8471000	8475000	Let me ask this, why should they shut the fuck up?
8475000	8477000	Me personally, I'm just tired of hearing about it.
8477000	8480000	I mean, you've got people who are over there that are fighting
8480000	8482000	who are actually all for the game.
8482000	8484000	They want their experiences in it.
8484000	8491000	They're over there doing what they have to do for us to do what we have to do here.
8491000	8493000	I feel that this is their game.
8493000	8496000	They earned this. Let them have it.
8496000	8500000	If people don't want to see it, then they just don't have to buy it.
8500000	8501000	Exactly.
8501000	8505000	Isn't it interesting that Konami might take more flak over not releasing this game
8505000	8509000	than they would have if they had released it?
8509000	8512000	One way or another, it'll be released, you know.
8512000	8517000	If not, someone's going to release a beta for everyone to go play, you know.
8517000	8519000	Yeah, I guess that's true.
8519000	8522000	I mean, you know, it'll leak. It'll get pirated.
8522000	8524000	Isn't that the inevitable?
8524000	8526000	That's always the case.
8526000	8528000	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Rama?
8528000	8533000	Not too much. I'm just glad that you guys got all the parts for the new studio PC.
8533000	8534000	They are all here.
8534000	8535000	Sadly, we haven't put it together yet.
8535000	8537000	Just the timing hasn't worked out.
8537000	8539000	I kind of figured.
8539000	8541000	Yeah, Loki's going to do it during our break next week
8541000	8543000	so that when we come back, we'll be on an all-new computer.
8543000	8548000	So maybe we'll try to find some other new things to show off next week after a little break.
8548000	8550000	Which we've been taking a lot of breaks this year.
8550000	8552000	I feel bad, but you know what?
8552000	8553000	It happens.
8553000	8555000	You guys earned it. I mean, really.
8555000	8557000	Well, thank you. I appreciate it.
8557000	8560000	You know, the guy before us very rarely takes a break,
8560000	8563000	so it always makes us look so terrible because he's always here.
8563000	8564000	He rarely takes breaks.
8564000	8567000	I think like once every four years, he might take a break.
8567000	8572000	Speaking of breaks, when are you going to be breaking to New York?
8572000	8574000	It's a possibility for later this year.
8574000	8580000	I really want to get back there, but it's just because I promised ASEN I would do that sometime.
8580000	8583000	I'm doing that this year, and that's going to be a chunk of money.
8583000	8586000	And then, you know, I still really want to do PAX and E3.
8586000	8588000	That's just going to set me back financially.
8588000	8591000	I still really want to try and do New York in the fourth quarter,
8591000	8594000	and if things continue to go well for me in my day job and everything,
8594000	8597000	and I don't have any worries about the economy or anything like that,
8597000	8601000	I'm hoping to do New York in the fourth quarter of the year, like maybe October again.
8601000	8603000	That would be awesome.
8603000	8608000	And on behalf of the New York Unwell Army, we have one request if you make it out this way.
8608000	8609000	Okay.
8609000	8612000	Pack Jamie and the suitcase with you.
8612000	8614000	I'll do what I can.
8614000	8617000	If I had the money for it, I would be happy to, but as it is,
8617000	8621000	I've had to already call off one trip that I was going to make at the end of this month,
8621000	8627000	and having to put in extra massage time just to save up for a trip in two months.
8627000	8632000	So I'm broke. I'm flat broke. School is wiping me out.
8632000	8634000	I guess I should say this.
8634000	8638000	Sadly, Dark Soccer is not going to be doing E3 with us, which is unfortunate,
8638000	8642000	but real life, greater than radio show.
8642000	8646000	Trust me, I really wanted to come back out there this year.
8646000	8648000	Again, I really wanted to.
8648000	8650000	Well, we'll make it work somehow.
8650000	8654000	Then we'll have the economy set us back a little bit,
8654000	8658000	but hopefully things will start to pick up, and then 2010 we'll have lots of visits.
8658000	8660000	You come here, I'll go there, we'll have a lot of fun.
8660000	8662000	So we're like an exchange program.
8662000	8667000	And I'll give in, and I might even go to Atlanta for Bobby and go to a Friday night gaming show.
8667000	8669000	Well, I will be down in Atlanta this year, so.
8669000	8672000	Will you really? For what, a convention or something?
8672000	8676000	Yeah, my company, we may be doing Dragon Con this year.
8676000	8678000	Oh, nice.
8678000	8680000	Well, if you're going to be there for Dragon Con,
8680000	8682000	I doubt Bobby's going to be there with his Friday night gaming shindig,
8682000	8686000	but if you happen to be there on a weekend and he's doing that, you should go say hi.
8686000	8689000	I know he likes to see the visitors out there.
8689000	8694000	I'm sorry, the name of the town escapes me that they tape in.
8694000	8695000	Oh, I'm bad.
8695000	8696000	What?
8696000	8699000	The name of the town that Bobby tapes Friday night gaming in is not Atlanta.
8699000	8701000	It's one of the suburbs.
8701000	8702000	I think that's where he lives.
8702000	8703000	Is it Marietta?
8703000	8705000	It's Marietta?
8705000	8708000	He'll correct me in a minute here, I'm sure.
8708000	8713000	Anyway, Rama, is there anything else you wanted to say on the show tonight?
8713000	8715000	Oh, he hung up.
8715000	8717000	Did I accidentally click and hang up on him? I hope not.
8717000	8718000	All right.
8718000	8720000	Well, we're going to go ahead and take some more calls.
8720000	8722000	Sorry, Rama, if I hung up on you, I didn't mean to.
8722000	8726000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8726000	8730000	You can go ahead and give us a call, and we'll be standing by waiting for your call.
8730000	8733000	And actually, our internet went down in studio.
8733000	8735000	That's why we lost DJ Rama.
8735000	8736000	Is anybody online doing?
8736000	8737000	I don't do anything.
8737000	8738000	Nobody's doing anything?
8738000	8741000	Okay, well, right now it is trying to reconnect right now.
8741000	8744000	We went down.
8744000	8745000	Oh, there we go.
8745000	8746000	Woo.
8746000	8749000	Roswell is the town that they tape in.
8749000	8750000	I'm still on.
8750000	8751000	There we go.
8751000	8752000	I'm sorry.
8752000	8755000	I got it back, but the stream is down right now, unfortunately.
8755000	8758000	So can we post that in chat that the stream is down but Skype is still open?
8758000	8759000	Hold on.
8759000	8762000	All right.
8762000	8767000	So, yeah, we unfortunately have that outage right now, but that's what happens sometimes with live radio.
8767000	8768000	Things go down.
8768000	8769000	Okay, good.
8769000	8770000	Stream's back up.
8770000	8771000	Hooray.
8771000	8772000	All right.
8772000	8773000	1877 Game OLR.
8773000	8774000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8774000	8775000	Give us a call.
8775000	8777000	We'll take some calls.
8777000	8781000	If you can't get through, keep trying.
8781000	8786000	That little spurt of downtime we might have just had could have affected the calls.
8786000	8787000	Okay.
8787000	8788000	I think we're getting calls again.
8788000	8789000	Hi.
8789000	8790000	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8790000	8791000	Who's this?
8791000	8794000	This is Spazinator.
8794000	8795000	Hi.
8795000	8796000	You're breaking up there a little bit.
8796000	8797000	Who is this?
8797000	8798000	Spazinator.
8798000	8799000	Hi, Spazinator.
8799000	8800000	What's on your mind?
8800000	8801000	Yeah.
8801000	8810000	Well, I did these earlier, but apparently I sent the email a little bit too late, so
8810000	8815000	more or less I was going to repeat a couple of questions.
8815000	8816000	Yeah.
8816000	8824000	And they're more or less directed towards you since you got your position through in
8824000	8826000	a few months or so.
8826000	8828000	Basically, although I was-
8828000	8831000	I just want to point out the connection is still really bad, but go ahead and ask your
8831000	8833000	questions and we'll try to answer them.
8833000	8837000	I don't know if we can stay on, but keep going with your questions.
8837000	8838000	Yeah.
8838000	8847000	Basically, do you have any overall impressions of the PlayStation 3?
8847000	8850000	Overall impression of the PlayStation 3?
8850000	8853000	It's very similar to how I feel about the PSP.
8853000	8859000	Is that the- God, now I'm having problems in the chat room as well.
8859000	8862000	Jeez, I don't know what's going on with the connection tonight.
8862000	8864000	My PlayStation 3, I feel very similar with the PSP.
8864000	8869000	Its biggest forte is not games, but it does a lot of the other things very well.
8869000	8872000	Like, you know, it's got the Blu-ray, which is great for movies.
8872000	8875000	It can play the digital files very well and very easy.
8875000	8878000	It seems like it's almost easier than Xbox.
8878000	8882000	You know, the internet browsing on it is better than it is on the Wii.
8882000	8885000	It has some cool little built-in things for the CD music.
8885000	8889000	So it's kind of like, it's not my favorite of the gaming systems.
8889000	8891000	I think my Xbox 360 is my favorite gaming system.
8891000	8895000	But I love the fact that it's quiet and I think that it's kind of,
8895000	8898000	I don't think it's a bad system at all.
8898000	8900000	I just wish they get some better exclusives.
8900000	8904000	But they do have some games I love, like Little Big Planet.
8904000	8912000	And also, in terms of the multi-platform games out there,
8912000	8919000	do you ever have a difficult time trying to pick and choose
8919000	8922000	which system you're going to get the game for,
8922000	8926000	especially if there's no real difference between, let's say,
8926000	8930000	the 360 version and the PlayStation 3 version?
8930000	8932000	I have been in that situation before.
8932000	8934000	Street Fighter 4 was the last time I had to make that decision
8934000	8936000	because I pretty much swore up and down to myself
8936000	8939000	I was going to get Street Fighter 4 on PlayStation 3
8939000	8941000	because PlayStation 3 had the better controller
8941000	8943000	and I knew I'd be able to pull off the moves easier on the controller.
8943000	8945000	Damn, I wish Microsoft would fix that.
8945000	8948000	As opposed to doing all this motion controller BS that they're starting,
8948000	8951000	I really wish they would just fix the controller they've got
8951000	8953000	and make that D-pad easier.
8953000	8955000	But anyhow, I ended up getting it on the 360
8955000	8959000	because I thought Microsoft can fix their controller later on.
8959000	8962000	And just more people are on the 360 playing it.
8962000	8965000	You know, I can go on Xbox Live and there's way more people playing it,
8965000	8969000	whereas on my PlayStation 3 friends list there's not nearly as many people, you know?
8969000	8971000	Yeah, that's true.
8971000	8976000	Yeah, completely unrelated topic.
8976000	8983000	I finally found something that's far, far worse than being Rick Rolled.
8983000	8985000	Uh-oh, what's that?
8985000	8989000	It's kind of similar to being Rick Rolled where someone sends you a wake
8989000	8993000	just saying it's one thing, and it turns out to be something else.
8993000	8997000	As long as it's not that two girls, one cup crap.
8997000	9001000	No, actually there is a girl involved.
9001000	9005000	Maybe you're kind of familiar with the story
9005000	9008000	because apparently it occurred out your way.
9008000	9010000	Apparently some girl in California
9010000	9015000	died on Halloween Day two years ago
9015000	9020000	and some cop released an accident in a photo.
9020000	9022000	Someone sent me a wake.
9022000	9024000	That's disgusting.
9024000	9028000	Why do people have to perpetuate that stuff?
9028000	9032000	I feel like it's violating someone's privacy to do that kind of crap.
9032000	9034000	I just think it's disgusting.
9034000	9037000	I realize everybody has their morbid curiosity, but please,
9037000	9040000	it's kind of disrespecting to this gal or whatever.
9040000	9043000	Anyway, Spaznator, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
9043000	9044000	Have a good one?
9044000	9045000	Yep.
9045000	9047000	All right, and if you want to call, give us a call.
9047000	9049000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9049000	9052000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9052000	9054000	What's 1-877-GAME-OLR?
9054000	9057000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9057000	9059000	We'll take a couple more calls here tonight,
9059000	9060000	and then we're going to wrap things up.
9060000	9062000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9062000	9064000	DS Master 26.
9064000	9066000	Well, hello DS Master 26. What's on your mind tonight?
9066000	9074000	Not much other than, well, the whole guitar hero versus rock band debate.
9074000	9082000	It's kind of unraveling for me because, I mean, what the heck?
9082000	9090000	You know, I've heard my friends at the Hanna Club kind of rumor again and again at some point.
9090000	9101000	They're probably knowing how Konami teamed up with Disney a bunch of times to get the Disney DDRs and whatever.
9101000	9105000	Are you saying that you're afraid this is going to go the route of the DDRs
9105000	9110000	or that it's not such a bad thing because there's been so many DDRs with the Disney and all that stuff?
9110000	9113000	You know, probably to expand our audience.
9113000	9119000	I mean, I guess it could work, but, I mean, the Wii was a family system to begin with.
9119000	9127000	So, I'm thinking of just bringing it in at 360 anyways if I'm doing guitar hero stuff
9127000	9132000	and using it for Ben and using the Wii for everything else.
9132000	9138000	You know, that's an interesting correlation, though, when you consider the whole Lego rock band
9138000	9141000	and how it's supposed to be kind of the more kiddie-friendly game.
9141000	9146000	It would be interesting to kind of correlate that with the fact that they have the Disney Dance Dance Revolution games
9146000	9149000	that are more geared at a younger audience, too.
9149000	9153000	Yeah, I mean, I could see that being a little bit of a competition sense.
9153000	9159000	I mean, but at the only...
9159000	9162000	I think you're breaking up there. Hello?
9162000	9164000	Morning.
9164000	9168000	Okay, unfortunately, the caller's breaking up.
9168000	9171000	I don't know, it must be us having internet problems.
9171000	9173000	It's Comcast-ic tonight, folks.
9173000	9174000	What can we say?
9174000	9179000	Dude, my internet's been crap all day at home, and I am with Comcast.
9179000	9183000	We have been having issues here in the area, like when the rain started and all that stuff,
9183000	9185000	so I don't know what the hell's going on.
9185000	9186000	So I apologize to folks.
9186000	9188000	Well, let's try to get one more call. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
9188000	9192000	1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9192000	9193000	Go ahead and give us a call.
9193000	9195000	See, the chat room stopped again, and I'm wondering if that means...
9195000	9197000	Do we crap out on... No?
9197000	9199000	We're still broadcasting.
9199000	9200000	Jeez.
9200000	9206000	Just to be on the safe side, since we're toward the end, I closed all my browsers.
9206000	9209000	I think I pinged out a chat, so I don't think...
9209000	9211000	Yeah, I'm not...
9211000	9214000	So we can't see it. No, and the stream went down on top of all that.
9214000	9218000	Boy, what a fun, fun time we're having tonight.
9218000	9221000	Everybody sure they're not downloading anything? Is my roommate...
9221000	9222000	I'm not downloading anything.
9222000	9224000	Is my roommate doing anything? I hope not.
9224000	9225000	He should know.
9225000	9226000	He's watching TV.
9226000	9228000	That's what he usually does during the show, so I don't know what's going on.
9228000	9231000	All right, well, we'll try to get one more call. Again, 1877-GAME-OLR.
9231000	9232000	Our username is SkyPornsLoungeRadio.
9232000	9235000	Do we have any last-minute news while we wait? Last-minute stories?
9235000	9236000	Sure.
9236000	9237000	Okay.
9237000	9239000	DarkSoccer, why don't you start us off with some last-minute stories?
9239000	9240000	I like pie.
9240000	9242000	Loki.
9242000	9243000	Actually got some stuff.
9243000	9248000	Ultima Online is actually bringing out a new expansion.
9248000	9251000	The Stygania Abyss, I guess.
9251000	9257000	And apparently it will allow you to play as a new class, the Gargoyle class.
9257000	9263000	And you'll also be able to explore the new Gargoyle home of Turmer
9263000	9266000	and the Stygania Abyss, I guess, dungeon,
9266000	9271000	which is the largest dungeon area ever introduced into Ultima Online.
9271000	9272000	That's pretty cool.
9272000	9276000	I can't believe that Ultima Online is still alive and kicking after all these years.
9276000	9278000	That's pretty impressive in itself.
9278000	9279000	Yes.
9279000	9280000	Oh, yes.
9280000	9283000	All right. Well, hello, caller. You're on the air.
9283000	9284000	You're supposed to wait for me to acknowledge you.
9284000	9285000	What's up, everybody? There's Zaku.
9285000	9289000	Hi, Zaku. What's on your mind, buddy, while we're having crappy internet problems tonight?
9289000	9290000	Nothing much.
9290000	9293000	Just praying that the street doesn't go down again
9293000	9296000	and just enjoying the fact that me and my brother have the house to ourselves
9296000	9299000	because Mom's on vacation in Peru.
9299000	9300000	So what's on your mind?
9300000	9302000	What do you have possession to call in tonight?
9302000	9309000	You're just bragging that you have the house all to yourself.
9309000	9311000	Hello? God damn it.
9311000	9313000	Hello, are you there?
9313000	9316000	Caller, are you there?
9316000	9318000	We lost another one.
9318000	9321000	Okay, we're going to turn off Justin TV and hope that that will help things.
9321000	9324000	So, boy, oh, boy.
9324000	9327000	I guess it's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9327000	9330000	I want to dump the end of the show.
9330000	9333000	Oh, well, that happens sometimes, guys.
9333000	9339000	If Zaku can get his question out in chat, we'll try to answer it, guys.
9339000	9341000	If you want to get your questions out in chat, we'll try to answer them
9341000	9344000	while Loki gets some last minute stories out of the way.
9344000	9346000	You could just do Ask Gordon's Lounge or something like that.
9346000	9347000	Maybe.
9347000	9353000	Mr. T and Will Wright are teaming up against Nazis in a new Zootfly game.
9353000	9355000	Zootfly, you may remember, is the company.
9355000	9358000	Originally they were pitching the Ghostbusters game,
9358000	9361000	and they've also done some other stuff beyond that.
9361000	9365000	But now they're making a Mr. T game.
9365000	9366000	Mr. T.
9366000	9367000	What?
9367000	9369000	Yes, he will take on Nazis.
9369000	9370000	Will you tell people to get nuts?
9370000	9373000	Apparently the first game will see Mr. T take on Nazis
9373000	9379000	and their gigantic machines in a varied universe of South American rainforests,
9379000	9385000	lost ancient cities, industrial complexes, and contemporary military installations.
9385000	9388000	Along with Mr. T and other characters from the graphic novel,
9388000	9391000	the game will feature none other than Will Wright.
9391000	9394000	In this universe, Will Wright is a top-notch game designer,
9394000	9405000	but a top-notch American geneticist who was kidnapped and coerced to work on a diabolic plan,
9405000	9410000	and Mr. T and Will Wright will join forces to annihilate the Nazis and their hardware.
9410000	9413000	Who was smoking crack when they thought of this?
9413000	9414000	That's an awesome game.
9414000	9418000	I bet you anything they saw the Snickers commercials with Mr. T.
9418000	9421000	It does sound all kinds of awesome, don't get me wrong, but jeez.
9421000	9424000	All right, by the way, for the live listeners, we've been going up and down.
9424000	9429000	We killed Justin.tv to try and free up some bandwidth in case that was our problem,
9429000	9431000	but it didn't seem to help on that last call.
9431000	9435000	So we are aware JTV is down. We've taken it down completely.
9435000	9438000	And yeah, we're just trying to finish up the show at this point.
9438000	9441000	We just turned off Skype because the calls just aren't cooperating tonight.
9441000	9443000	I don't know what's going on, guys.
9443000	9445000	All of our configurations are fine on our end.
9445000	9448000	There's no cable problems. Nothing's falling apart.
9448000	9451000	No video card issues. It's something on the Comcast.
9451000	9458000	And then there was an update to Nobby Nobby Boy, which apparently added the 4-Boy offline multiplayer mix.
9458000	9462000	In addition, there's a new boy that you get to play as, Fart Boy.
9462000	9463000	What?
9463000	9465000	Yes, Fart Boy.
9465000	9466000	Is that his given name?
9466000	9469000	That is his given name, Fart Boy.
9469000	9475000	As well as, I guess, the lower key updates, they have variations to the boy's house hairstyles
9475000	9479000	and new poses to the game's bird.
9479000	9482000	That's awesome.
9482000	9487000	Then we were talking a little bit about the rumors of the PSP Go.
9487000	9492000	Well, there's a new game coming from Capcom, Fate Unlimited.
9492000	9496000	They're going to put that actually on...
9496000	9499000	It's going to be download only in Europe.
9499000	9503000	But apparently Capcom is releasing on the UMD elsewhere.
9503000	9511000	So they're kind of testing that whole thing to see if people actually buy the download content only games.
9511000	9512000	I don't know.
9512000	9514000	Maybe it is a sign of things to come.
9514000	9516000	What do you think is going to happen if the answer is no?
9516000	9518000	They don't.
9518000	9520000	They're fucked.
9520000	9522000	They've invested all this in the PSP Go thing.
9522000	9526000	Well, I heard the rumor about the PSP Go is that the design is not finalized yet,
9526000	9530000	and so they could add the UMD drive if necessary.
9530000	9533000	I think it would be a good idea if they were...
9533000	9535000	I mean, what's the point in taking it out?
9535000	9538000	Other than UMD is a failed format, but they're still using it.
9538000	9539000	Who cares?
9539000	9540000	I don't know.
9540000	9542000	Whatever.
9542000	9547000	And then finally, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 has been confirmed to be coming out on the Xbox Live Arcade
9547000	9550000	and PlayStation Network this summer.
9550000	9554000	And then also, they had a PS3 demo that came out this week, actually.
9554000	9557000	So if you want to check that out, you can.
9557000	9560000	And of course, that was that countdown that they had going.
9560000	9565000	They're going to have, apparently, all 56 characters will be unlocked from the beginning.
9565000	9571000	And they're going to also feature, I guess, some HD upscaling,
9571000	9578000	as well as widescreen options and custom soundtracks on both the PS3 and Xbox 360.
9578000	9583000	And they also have three different screen modes that you can do.
9583000	9593000	You can do just the classic pixelated look, and then they have a smooth and a crisp look that you can do.
9593000	9598000	And finally...
9598000	9601000	I just want to say for the live listeners, while the stream is up,
9601000	9605000	I have double-checked everything in the house, including what's going on with my roommate and everything.
9605000	9607000	We don't know what's going on with the stream right now,
9607000	9611000	so we're just going to try and limp our way through the end of the show at this point.
9611000	9613000	We're almost there.
9613000	9614000	Sorry, guys.
9614000	9620000	There's been a picture of the homebrew enabler on the PSP-3000 working,
9620000	9627000	so it's only a matter of time before the custom firmware is on the PSP-3000, so that's interesting.
9627000	9632000	And finally, we were talking a little bit about Wolverine Origins, the video game.
9632000	9639000	Well, apparently, since Activision is fun like that, and Blizzard likes doing all sorts of crazy stuff,
9639000	9645000	they've hidden a lot of little Easter eggs in the game, including references to Portal.
9645000	9649000	They have a surprise cake that you can get that unlocks the achievement.
9649000	9655000	And also, they even have the Frostmourne from World of Warcraft as well in there
9655000	9660000	that you can get an achievement that's titled Wow.
9660000	9663000	Wow.
9663000	9664000	Amazing.
9664000	9666000	So lots of little hidden goodies.
9666000	9671000	All right, well, we're going to go around and wrap up the show, get everybody's final thoughts.
9671000	9674000	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
9674000	9679000	I want animal-style fries and a milkshake.
9679000	9684000	My final thought is I hate internet problems that you can't explain.
9684000	9686000	Loki?
9686000	9691000	My final thought is actually this story from Destructoid talking about Yahoo.
9691000	9699000	Apparently, remember last week we talked a little bit about how ThinkGeek was selling Dreamcast systems for $99?
9699000	9704000	Well, apparently, somebody at Yahoo decided to report that according to the internet,
9704000	9711000	the Dreamcast is being re-released to compete with the PlayStation 2 because of the price drop to $99.
9711000	9714000	Somebody needs to do their research.
9714000	9716000	That's it.
9716000	9721000	All right, well, thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and downloading
9721000	9726000	and especially the live listeners who stuck with us through the ups and downs of the connections tonight.
9726000	9729000	Don't know what's going on. The internet's crazy like that sometimes.
9729000	9732000	But thank you guys for staying with us, especially those of you on the podcast,
9732000	9735000	for downloading and supporting independent radio. We really appreciate it.
