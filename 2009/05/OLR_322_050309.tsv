14141	19445	Tonight, May 3rd, 2009, will we see multiple motion controllers at this year's E3?
19805	22507	Are the Ninja Turtles being remade for a new downloadable game?
22868	25670	And a new video game will let you show off your ironing skills.
32116	36319	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36359	41842	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41902	43003	I'm with you here every week.
43163	45084	Rob Roberts also joining you tonight.
45124	48106	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48406	48806	Hi.
49007	51388	Always here with us as usual.
51668	52028	How you doing?
53109	53789	I'm recovering.
54030	54550	Recovering?
55151	55971	Are you an alcoholic?
56171	56452	No.
56532	57072	Sorry to hear it.
57492	58733	From the week from hell.
59253	60553	I'm sorry to hear about the week from hell.
60854	62935	Or is there a lot of gaming to be done in the week from hell?
64115	65276	Some, actually, a little.
65496	69938	All right, we'll get to that in just a moment, but we can't start the show without introducing the one and only Techmaster Loki.
70178	70398	Hello.
70658	71098	How are you doing?
71318	71979	Good.
72379	75940	And I see your normal Sunday ration of fast food.
76160	77241	You have some Burger King tonight.
77461	77681	Yes.
77781	78682	Sticking with the traditionals.
79742	85624	I was going to get McDonald's, but I somehow was in a daze and drove past it.
85964	91745	How exactly do you select what your fast grub is going to be before the show, before you get here?
91825	92466	Just what I feel like.
92586	93286	Just what you feel like?
93846	94426	Yeah.
94506	95827	What are you going to stop at on the way?
96407	103649	I was driving home from Oakland right before the show, so I wouldn't have been able to stop somewhere healthy because it takes a lot longer.
105349	122215	and unfortunately fast food didn't take quite as, it wasn't as fast as I had hoped because an idiot in front of me decided to use a coupon for their fast food order and the coupon didn't apply to what they had ordered so he sat there arguing with them for a good 10 minutes and that sucked.
122735	129498	Misty in our chat room at chat.orangelandradio.com starts us off tonight wanting to know but the question is what kind of BK noms?
130699	135421	Double Bacon Cheeseburger Very healthy Exactly, it's very delicious
137406	144911	All right, and Black Wolf, the gentleman before us here Sunday nights when we tape live on All Games Radio at about 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
145591	148593	Black Wolf is in chat and says, hey, I heard this was a show about video games.
149334	151475	Once in a while, once in a while we do talk about video games.
151495	152256	In fact, let's get to it.
152936	155438	We always like to start off a little bit of how is your gaming week?
155818	159220	There's no guests tonight, just you guys in the chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
159641	161102	We'll start off tonight with Dark Sakura.
161122	161902	How was your gaming week?
163003	166185	I played Cooking Mama on iPhone while waiting for Wolverine to start.
167605	169748	The rest of it was spent on homework.
170709	172972	All week, homework.
173613	173973	The end.
186246	187506	It cuts into your cooking moment time.
188247	190407	It's annoying, but it is smart marketing.
190547	193928	So I try not to think of it one way or another.
194268	197409	The bottom line is all that matters to the companies.
197989	202210	So, of course, they're going to try to get the word out there in every front possible that's just marketing.
202730	206251	So I'm really, I guess, indifferent towards the whole thing.
206472	215234	Yeah, I may not care about what does that show with What's-Her-Face, Kira Sedgwick, but the only good thing I saw her in was singles anyway.
215994	219356	I liked the first 15 minutes of it.
219416	220156	That part was great.
220696	221837	It was all about Wade not shutting up.
244949	245910	Without spoiling anything.
246170	248692	Now the listeners should know you're a total Deadpool fan girl.
248712	249712	I am a total Deadpool fan.
249732	252754	So this was very important, the treatment that he received in the movie.
252874	255076	Yes, I'm sure you love the end.
256414	257815	Depending on which ending.
259096	262078	The actual end and not the end after the end.
262338	265880	The bonus end, okay, if you watch after the credits, there's one of two endings.
266681	269002	And I got the more lame one.
269763	273265	And I got to see the other one on YouTube before it got pulled off.
274066	278609	And I wish I'd had that one because it made me a lot happier and had some fourth wall breakage.
278829	280450	We don't want to give spoilers, though.
280530	281551	I'm not saying anything.
281691	284473	They're just doing that so they can whore that character out for another whore movie.
284493	286155	That's more warning Loki than you.
286635	293080	No, because I've been reading several interviews and articles where they're leaving it open for a Deadpool movie.
293100	296563	Which would make me happy if they do it freaking right.
297802	304124	Question from chat, and a comment from chat, I like old people in chat, which by the way, I still love that name, says, X-Men applies to games because there is a game of it.
304144	305824	Actually, there's been several games about the X-Men.
306784	313466	I remember an old school one on the PC, like back in the early 90s, where you were trying to rescue Storm.
313486	315946	I don't even remember what the game, I think it was just X-Men, or whatever.
315966	318547	But yeah, X-Men and games have always been kind of tied together a little bit.
318567	319447	There's always those tie-ins.
319787	323488	But DJRamaS asks, how well did Ryan Reynolds play Deadpool?
324414	324775	Deadpool, Wade,
338888	339548	X-Men X-Men X-Men X-Men
362615	363896	It was pure and utter ass.
379922	382544	They had nothing to do with each other, you know what I'm talking about.
382564	382964	I know, I know.
383344	384865	They tipped the hat, is what I'm saying.
384906	392992	And then Gambit, I mean, hello, I was a little worried about how they were going to portray Gambit, but he showed up and was like, hi, I'm Gambit, I'm going to be awesome now.
394373	401158	What I was actually most pleased with about him is that his accent is legitimate.
401579	404101	It's not one of those overdone fake Cajun accents.
404201	408364	It sounds pretty right for the area, so I was pretty pleased with that.
409132	432552	Actdeft is in our chatroom and says I couldn't see the movie since theaters are closed in Mexico because he lives in Mexico and you know how swine flu is all the rage down there as it is starting to be up here too they're closing all the movie theaters Rei Ayanami said sine flu and I'm certainly thinking cosine flu next alright, let's get into more video games Loki, did you play anything this week?
434754	436916	yes I did, I played some DS stuff
438243	439744	Zero plus zero equals zero Exactly
466653	466813	Rick!
466833	467394	Rick!
480464	480984	Actual games.
481104	483925	I played more of the Great Giana Sisters DS game.
484786	485226	How is that?
485266	486086	I need to check that out.
486827	487967	It's a basic DS game.
487987	492309	It's just, you know, very much a ripoff of Super Mario Bros.
492809	498391	But that's what made the old school one on the Commodore 64 so awesome, was that it was such a ripoff of Mario Bros.
499051	499692	How's the music?
499752	502113	Because I love the soundtrack to the Giana Sisters.
502753	503573	It's okay.
503733	510096	It's not, I mean, I didn't notice any old remakes or whatever, but maybe there were, I mean...
510916	512077	I never really played the original.
513098	521683	But it was funny though, I like how she gets the red orb or whatever and becomes Emojiana or whatever and just starts throwing fire that way.
521703	525025	It's like, oh look, I went to Hot Topic, now I'm gonna kick ass.
526986	527766	So that was okay.
528267	534010	Played a little bit more Rhythm Heaven, but I still can't stand that game because it's not forgiving at all.
534390	538373	I mean, just, I'm trying to get gold on stuff and it's just not...
539232	540492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
562101	564784	It feels like a copy of a copy, and it's also confusing.
564804	567007	They don't really tell you what you're supposed to be doing a lot of times.
567047	571113	I'm like, it's not like, you know, where it's like chop, and you kind of get what you're supposed to do.
571813	574056	This I couldn't figure it out, so it was annoying.
574877	577481	And they played a lot more Grand Theft Auto.
579201	584864	I'm trying to make a flamethrower, and I kind of got one sort of made out of a sniper rifle and some fire effect thing.
598770	603275	And it works pretty good, except sometimes you can catch yourself on fire, which is kind of annoying.
603455	604416	Well, now that's no fun.
604536	612824	When another one, like a hurricane bomb or something, where you throw it down and it just throws everything around, but it can kill yourself also pretty violently sometimes.
613304	615406	So, just kind of messing with that.
616047	616628	And then...
618384	618705	What else?
618785	631014	Oh, I tried playing Bionic Commando, but the problem is, at our work, our internet's like, even though we're on a T1, it's like split 200 ways, and it's slow as hell, and I couldn't connect to any games.
631074	635738	So that was very disappointing, and fortunately this weekend, being so busy, I didn't get a chance to actually play that.
635818	637659	But I do want to play that, because that game looks awesome.
639738	642559	So yeah, that's pretty much it for this week.
642579	655522	And I think I may have played a little bit more Excitebots somewhere in there, because I finally unlocked Super Excite, so I'm actually even playing through that tonight, which apparently is very unforgiving, even more so than the first game.
657082	659762	Yeah, and Excitebots is here in studio tonight.
659782	660523	Yes, on Justin.tv.
660683	662563	So the wife finally let it go for you.
662583	663783	She gave up on it, actually.
663863	664704	Oh my gosh, really?
665044	666124	Yeah, she said it was too hard.
666923	671987	And by the way, if you've never listened to the show before, something you should know about Loki's wife, she really doesn't play a lot of games.
672267	675590	But there'll be that occasional game she gets obsessed with, and Excitebots is one of them.
676050	681615	Yeah, Excitebot, or Excite Truck was really the one that, yeah, and then, you know, Excitebot she was really looking forward to.
681635	688941	And she still, you know, had fun with it, but it's just, she's gotten to, you know, kind of a wall right now where she can't, you know, S-rank these super Excitebots.
689001	690882	And I got, I mean, it's really hard.
690922	693625	I mean, you have to get even more points than you did in the first time.
693645	696587	And the first time, you know, in just normal Excite race,
697369	701672	I mean, getting S sometimes requires you to play a track like 20 times, if not more than that.
702352	704834	And now you have to get even more than what you got before.
704874	707776	It's just like, you want to pull your hair out.
708517	710098	And then you get mirror mode, which is even harder.
711259	712480	And that's always fun.
713160	715341	But you unlock more bots.
716582	717423	I saw the hand.
717963	720305	Yes, there's a hand that tries to smack you for some reason.
720785	722587	It's the Smash Brothers hand.
722987	725729	I guess it's Master Hand, but it's a hand that tries to smash you.
725809	726109	I don't know.
727028	728228	for no apparent reason whatsoever.
729728	730989	I do kind of want to check this game out.
731029	737390	I hope... No, we don't have any guests to play it on JustinTV tonight, but hopefully we'll have an in-between stories, kind of be able to play some.
737630	737790	Yeah.
738210	740570	Oh, I also played a 101-in-1 retro game.
740590	743811	I forget what it was called.
743831	746271	It's that Atlus collection of little mini-games.
746871	755513	That sucked too, because apparently you start off with like 10 games, and you have to play through all of them, and they don't control very well, and...
757005	763268	You have to score so many points before you can unlock another game, and I can't, because it doesn't control very well, and it's annoying.
763548	763808	Dope.
764288	764688	That's alright.
765809	766089	Alright.
766709	766989	That's it.
767570	768610	Um, well, let's see, Mikey.
768690	774953	Oh, oh, but I did want to mention something else we played, which I don't remember exactly the title of the game.
774973	779375	I thought it was something like, um, was it, uh, Eat Poop Cat or something like that?
781003	786497	Oh, yeah, the one, uh, Eat... Yeah, I remember, yeah, it had a very weird name.
786657	788803	Eat Something Cat Poop or something like that was the name of the game.
788843	789044	Yeah.
790407	791207	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
813916	822601	And then you pass it again, the next person writes the caption they think goes with the picture, then they fold over the picture, and the next person draws a picture to go with the caption, and so on and so on.
822641	825682	I know it sounds stupid as I'm describing it, but it's actually a lot of fun.
826002	829544	Because there's always someone in the group who will turn everything into penis.
830525	832066	No matter, you know, what you do.
832426	833806	That person was Rice Princess.
833967	834167	Yes.
835747	836048	Truth.
837028	837628	Alright, anyhow.
838309	838349	Um...
839784	840525	Other games.
840565	840825	Let's see.
840905	841685	My gaming week.
841725	843227	Actually, I didn't play a lot of new stuff.
843307	845488	I still had the old standby old stuff.
846029	852893	Especially a lot of classic gaming on the Nintendo Wii this week going into my archive of like Zelda and Kid Icarus and all the old school stuff.
853514	855175	Not a lot of new stuff for me this week.
855816	858958	I don't think there's been a lot of new stuff that's been out recently that's kind of caught my attention.
859018	865803	So I am excited though about some of the Xbox Live arcade releases coming up at least this coming week that I'm hoping to try out before
866303	866665	Animae Central
871317	872737	Let's get into some housekeeping tonight.
873378	875118	I wanted to talk about and give a little reminder.
875138	878419	I am going to be at Anime Central this weekend in Chicago.
879219	880580	I have a panel on Friday.
880620	882300	It's called So You Think You Can Podcast.
882720	897525	So if you ever want to hear more about how OLR got started or kind of the story behind it, or you want to start your own podcast and kind of curious where do I begin, what kind of mics do I need, how do I get a listener base or what have you, I'm going to be doing that panel 4.30 on Friday.
897565	900926	And I believe it's panel room 7, but I'm doing that off the top of my head.
901266	903708	Please check the program for the specific location.
904548	908191	I know it's one of the smaller rooms because they're not anticipating there's going to be a big crowd for that.
908251	910832	So let's prove them wrong and make it standing room only.
911893	916696	Also, I want to give another thank you to the listeners for the wonderful show computer.
916736	923941	Sadly, we're not broadcasting off that tonight, but I think when we come back in two weeks, we're going to be on that show computer, the new one, right?
924001	926043	Yes, we're having a chance to actually put it together.
926183	927183	Yeah, it just hasn't worked out.
927263	930906	And by the way, since of ASEN next week, I do not believe there's going to be a show next week.
932606	933967	So next week we will be off.
934707	937568	Unfortunately, I don't get back from Chicago until... Actually, it's funny.
937728	939389	I get back at like 7 o'clock.
939769	941729	So I'm just going to miss.
941809	944150	And that's hoping there's no delays or anything like that.
945311	946671	Sadly, we will not be here next week.
946711	948432	But Bobby, of course, will be here as always.
948832	950132	So give his show a listen.
950192	952333	He'll probably run a little long next week to compensate.
952653	956514	Yeah, Bobby was saying that he played Paul's Big Adventure on WiiWare.
957034	958195	Which I've been meaning to actually...
958775	961136	Play or install.
961476	962877	But I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.
963137	964518	But that's a pretty awesome game.
964538	967599	That's the one that kind of rips off of all these different old school games.
968459	971661	They have like the Castle from Mario Brothers and stuff in it and like weird stuff.
972611	973451	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
995879	996900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1018697	1036071	for a personal thing I do I've been using YouTube a lot more recently for like a non-gaming thing so I've learned how to like edit video a lot better and do that stuff so I'm excited to go to ASEN and actually shoot some video so I hope our listeners aren't camera shy because I will be in your face with a camera and if so too bad yes too bad alright
1037438	1037998	So I'm excited.
1038519	1040740	Okay, that's really it for housekeeping tonight.
1040840	1043001	Let's get into some video game news.
1043541	1045723	We have a lot of rumors tonight.
1045803	1046943	Rumors, rumors, rumors.
1047323	1048744	But aren't rumors fun to talk about?
1048984	1052026	And we're going to see if they seem real or not to us.
1052146	1053547	And I think Loki's going to start us off tonight.
1053687	1056348	Yes, one rumor that we have came from Engadget.
1056869	1060591	Apparently, they have somebody that has captured what they...
1061451	1065074	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1080845	1081305	Thanks for watching!
1108290	1114535	They were saying that you can use it in a trivia game over the internet with live images of each person playing and the buzzing you would clap.
1116496	1122400	Some other stuff, including sensor detects when the person is playing.
1123181	1125602	Only the person that's playing the game and not the people that are just watching it.
1126543	1132867	But I do believe they showed this off the company behind it during CES this year.
1134128	1135229	And it looked interesting.
1135269	1135990	It's basically...
1137796	1138116	I don't know.
1138457	1143240	They were using actually just a normal webcam and they had a boxing game.
1143300	1144762	They were showing some guy doing that.
1144922	1148785	It almost looked like an eye toy boxing game because you could see the guy in the background and stuff.
1149686	1151187	They have like a flight sim game and stuff.
1151227	1158092	So basically the same kind of applications you would use like an eye toy for this would be used for.
1158292	1159373	But the eye toy sucked.
1159834	1161595	Yes, but technology is getting better.
1161915	1165118	Just like the PlayStation Eye is a lot better than the original eye toy.
1165138	1165979	Okay, first off.
1166644	1167564	Real or bullshit?
1167885	1168285	What do you think?
1168665	1169425	There's an image of it.
1169465	1172546	I would say it's real and this is something that they've already... Oh, come on.
1172566	1173927	We live in a day and age of Photoshop.
1174407	1182630	Okay, but they've already teased that, oh, we're going to show something off at E3 that's going to revolutionize the way you play games or the way you enjoy entertainment.
1183670	1183991	Uh, hello?
1185761	1186722	DarkSakura, real or bullshit?
1186742	1187322	You're not good for real.
1204325	1204946	Here's the thing, though.
1204986	1207008	Even though it's real, it's not that new.
1207268	1209330	We already have a camera on the Xbox 360.
1209650	1218057	And when I hear about this, I shudder because I think of Totem Ball, which was that horrible, horrible video camera game they had that they tried to do the full-body motion controls with.
1218117	1218537	Come on.
1219018	1221440	I mean, granted, technology's gotten a little better, but come on.
1221480	1222500	That game was shit.
1222581	1223021	I agree.
1223201	1223902	I agree with you.
1224142	1226524	And this technology, they actually bought a company.
1227104	1228525	Microsoft bought a company.
1233427	1239475	And I hear that guy, I forget his name, I want to say Bobby Lee, but I don't think it's Bobby Lee.
1239515	1240095	Something Lee.
1240536	1245442	Remember the guy that did all those wonderful Wiimote things with the stereoscopic or the...
1246616	1248017	Head Tracking, and that kind of stuff.
1248058	1249499	The one who did all those experiments.
1249579	1250420	Oh, yeah, the demos and stuff.
1250440	1253403	Yeah, he works for Microsoft now.
1254324	1256606	That is such a Microsoft thing to happen to.
1256706	1256967	Yes.
1257127	1257767	It's so funny.
1258408	1260991	So I would not be surprised if this is at E3.
1261031	1262132	This makes sense.
1262612	1266276	And we're going to get into a little bit more later on with other things.
1266597	1269600	But if you think about it, these companies now are starting to take away what...
1270515	1271576	is unique about the Wii.
1272016	1277261	And when you take away the motion sensing from the Wii, what's left?
1277601	1278201	A GameCube.
1278482	1279422	Nintendo franchises.
1279823	1283606	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, if at first you don't succeed, buy a company that does it better.
1283986	1286588	Chat.OrangeLinger.com if you want to join us in our chat room.
1288210	1289030	Here's the other thing about it.
1289110	1290792	Video conferencing, not new.
1291372	1293474	We already have that on the Xbox 360 with a camera.
1293554	1295616	It's just that nobody bought the camera.
1296296	1298658	Except people who wanted to play Strip Uno.
1298938	1300860	That's the only reason people bought the camera.
1300880	1302521	Remember that game, You're in the Movies?
1302861	1303281	Drop down to $20.
1303321	1305263	Oh yeah, I forgot about that game.
1305303	1307444	So it's $20 with the camera bundled in.
1308285	1309626	That's actually cheaper than buying the camera by itself.
1309646	1311947	Do you think it's because they're unloading the cameras because they're not going to need them anymore?
1312047	1312528	Probably.
1312908	1313548	And, you know...
1314529	1319512	I'm assuming it's going to be more than just a single camera, because obviously that didn't work before.
1319972	1321293	And they have new technology now.
1321473	1323874	We've even seen it before, like in past E3s.
1323894	1338761	I can remember way back to E3 2005, they were showing off camera technology that was actually putting bounding boxes around people's heads and was able to track individual people and was able to differentiate who's playing the game and who's not.
1339662	1343824	So I wouldn't be surprised if we see this.
1346192	1348493	Deathwishing says, I bought the camera for Rainbow Six Vegas.
1348833	1352294	Yeah, you know, there were a lot of little games that would use the camera.
1352494	1357455	You know, like Uno had it in some of the other online Xbox Live games.
1357875	1363377	And then some of the other games, like Burnout Paradise, you could take your driver's license picture with the camera.
1363497	1364217	Ooh, ah.
1364437	1366158	A little dumb shit like that.
1366178	1367378	Well, every time you, you know...
1368271	1369211	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1397797	1400558	Anyway, I also want to say some other comments from chat here.
1401159	1405201	BlackWolf, of all people, actually says, You're in the movies doesn't work too well, sadly.
1405441	1406562	I can't get the right lighting.
1407062	1410043	That's always a pain in the ass with these camera setups, too, is the lighting.
1410404	1413485	If it's not just right, the game works terribly.
1413545	1417467	Like, I had a couple of those iToy games on PlayStation 2, and they work like crap.
1418188	1418728	You know what I mean?
1418788	1420369	Like, you have to have the exact right lighting.
1420389	1425431	Well, I'm hoping that this stuff that comes out for wherever this camera peripheral is going to be...
1427139	1432082	It's hopefully going to be a little bit better than the current camera out there.
1432222	1433063	I've been a sucker.
1433543	1441168	I've bought all three cameras, both the PlayStation Eye toy and the Vision camera and the PlayStation Eye.
1441948	1443629	Granted, I haven't really used the PlayStation Eye.
1443649	1450773	I meant to use it when I was going to make all these little big planet levels, which I never did.
1450833	1456337	The Vision camera was... I don't even remember what the hell I bought the Vision camera for.
1457318	1458399	Just to have it, I think.
1459119	1466885	And, man, I can tell you at least with... I haven't tried the PlayStation 9 too much, but the other two, disappointment.
1466945	1471709	Except we did get a good webcam out of the iToy Play.
1472170	1472830	Back in the day.
1473170	1475072	So that kind of worked out.
1475552	1479335	Remember when iToy Chat was going to be the next big thing on the PlayStation 2?
1479956	1480676	Whatever happened to that?
1480956	1481717	Yeah, I don't know.
1483148	1483408	I don't know.
1483788	1486810	But yeah, the PlayStation Eye though, they're definitely doing a lot of things with it.
1486830	1490572	I mean, like they have that, you know, Eye, was it a pet thing that's coming out?
1491252	1496995	And, you know, the other concept games that they've made, you know, where they can capture images and stuff that people draw.
1498276	1499937	I wish they would actually... I have crap.
1500197	1502258	I wish they would actually implement, you know, that.
1502538	1505760	Well, this wasn't the Eye of Judgment stuff because scanning cards is retarded.
1505800	1506780	That's been around forever.
1506820	1509341	You know, hell, there's the e-reader on the Game Boy Advance.
1510422	1511683	I'm talking about actually...
1512874	1517395	Something unique where you can actually draw the tanks and stuff like that.
1517435	1518095	That's kind of cool.
1518695	1522516	But they never released it because it was just a little demo that they made.
1524236	1525217	Alright, well guess what?
1525277	1529237	This rumor about motion controllers does not stop with Microsoft and the Xbox.
1529458	1533898	Sony apparently is working on something as well, which shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, right?
1533938	1539940	Nintendo has been leading in sales and the big thing that separates their system from their competitors right now is the motion controls.
1540300	1540920	So of course...
1541420	1543702	Microsoft and Sony want to find ways to get a piece of the pie.
1544002	1546704	So we hear this out of Microsoft's camp and out of Sony's camp.
1546724	1551448	There's a rumor, according to this blog called The Cutscene, which is related to Variety.
1551508	1553229	So it's not just some Joe Schmoe's blog.
1553249	1557253	This is related to Variety, which is a huge magazine in the entertainment industry.
1558033	1562337	Some sources leaked to The Cutscene blog that Sony is going to be unveiling a new device at E3.
1562997	1566680	It's not quite the same thing, though, that Loki's been describing for Microsoft.
1566720	1567581	It's not a camera.
1568321	1570343	It's something that's going to have pointing in it.
1570663	1571123	Apparently.
1571184	1577529	It's basically... They don't know yet if it's going to be the regular controller infused with a pointer, which is a possibility.
1577809	1582673	But this thing that I'm looking at, according to these patents, almost look like... I don't know.
1582693	1585655	It looks like somebody's playing Samba de Amigo with these maraca-type things.
1585695	1588937	Now, they're not actually maracas, but the little pointers look like little devices.
1589218	1593601	But here's the thing, though, is really they're targets that are being used with the PlayStation Eye.
1594522	1595062	Oh, you think?
1595683	1596043	Yeah.
1596163	1596764	So it's not...
1597631	1603156	I mean, it's basically like the reverse of the Wii setup.
1603196	1604477	Instead of actually having the
1605854	1611355	Sensor bar just being a couple lights and then having the receiver being in the actual remote.
1611735	1617877	This is actually using the camera as the receiver and then the points or whatever of reference are actually on the controller.
1617997	1625659	Well, continuing on the patent here, they actually say, yeah, this small camera will track the movement of multiple LED lights on the controller.
1625699	1634001	So if you use your PlayStation Eye and maybe they're going to put lights in these controllers or something so that you can actually move them around, they call it a Wiimote in reverse.
1634321	1636483	Well, because it wouldn't be that hard for them.
1636523	1641247	They've already got 6-axis, which does all the tilting and that kind of stuff.
1641487	1646010	Now they really need depth of field and kind of the IR pointing stuff that the Wii has.
1646311	1646771	There you go.
1646791	1647471	They've said it.
1647712	1649573	Well, let me read you this one final quote about this.
1649793	1655378	Quote, Because the camera can read different color lights and the shape and angle of each light, it's much more accurate than the Wiimote.
1655618	1663204	It can track precise movements, including along the Z-axis, pushing towards and away from the TV, something the Wii is really bad at, as well as velocity.
1665162	1665882	Truth or bullshit?
1665982	1668343	Truth, but I'm not sure if they're announcing ID.3.
1690365	1690766	I don't know.
1707225	1708566	I'm going to say distorted truth.
1708887	1711629	I don't think it's necessarily – I'm along the lines of what you're saying.
1711649	1717114	I don't think that they're going to launch this whole new controller, this motion controller that you're going to have all this extra crap for your TV.
1717415	1724501	I think they're going to find ways to use the devices they already have, maybe releasing a new six-axis controller with the lights in it that's going to involve this.
1724782	1726864	So I would say distorted truth.
1728285	1730347	It's one of those where there's smoke, there's fire type of things.
1730407	1730827	I really don't know.
1755353	1757034	Every Sony rumor has been true.
1757114	1758574	So let's just go with true on this.
1758654	1761755	Because seriously, every time they're like, no, that's not really happening.
1761775	1762516	We have no plans for that.
1762556	1763276	What are you talking about?
1763296	1764637	And then it's like, oh, hey, look.
1765037	1765377	Hey, look.
1765637	1767157	Price drop on PlayStation 2.
1768398	1769578	That totally surprised you.
1769618	1774340	But wait, how many times have there been rumors that the PlayStation 3 price is going to drop or be redesigned?
1774420	1775120	That never happens.
1775280	1776201	I don't think that's rumors.
1776261	1778242	I think it's wishful thinking.
1778862	1784624	A lot of those rumors are coming from people thinking, okay, Microsoft's dropping their price or this is coming out.
1785578	1787308	They've got to drop it in order to be competitive.
1787368	1788756	Well, they don't care.
1791482	1792223	There's no price drop.
1792423	1793363	Just consider the source.
1793663	1794564	But it's going to happen.
1794924	1795184	All right.
1795725	1805011	So knowing that Microsoft and Sony, one way or another, we all pretty much agree, except DarkSakura's not sure, but we all pretty much agree they are making movements to go towards motion control.
1805051	1806692	We at least all agree that Microsoft's going to do it.
1806732	1807433	Let me put it this way.
1807493	1810915	If one of them does it, it's either Sony or Microsoft.
1810935	1812156	The other one's pretty much going to have to do it.
1812176	1813016	Of course Microsoft's going to do it.
1813056	1817519	Microsoft has made their machine out of ripping off good ideas and doing it well.
1817740	1819180	That's not a slam on Microsoft.
1819201	1821142	They do a great job of ripping off good ideas.
1821542	1822042	You know what I mean?
1822663	1823284	And making them better.
1825225	1826386	Anyway, here's what I want to ask.
1827067	1827967	Should Nintendo be worried?
1828508	1828728	Yes.
1830029	1833732	Because really, everyone's looking at innovative motion controls.
1833772	1837195	That's what they pride themselves on, these games.
1837475	1839577	And granted, they have franchises and stuff.
1839957	1845362	Don't get me wrong, Mario Kart's awesome, Mario Galaxy's cool, Zelda's really nice, but...
1846277	1846877	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1868365	1876310	A lot of people just pick up Tiger Woods' game on the Wii, even if they own both, because they want that extra immersion for it.
1877371	1884356	But now you can take those awesome, like Red Steel or something like that, or Matterworld, that looks awesome, but is kind of limited by the hardware.
1884636	1887898	Now you've got more power for the hardware and the motion controls.
1887978	1889439	That's going to be some really awesome games.
1889819	1891541	And unfortunately, Nintendo...
1892614	1899916	I can't see them doing anything very innovative at E3, and I bet you anything all their announcements are not going to be innovative and they're just going to be sequels to their franchises.
1900416	1904878	Much like a Pikmin 3, or, you know, like a sequel to Wii Fit.
1905178	1910980	Hell, I mean, they have a sequel to basically the Wii Moat coming out, you know, with Wii Motion Plus, the fix, something they should have had in the first place.
1911360	1914461	And a sequel to Wii Sports, because that's what sells on their system.
1915757	1917919	And funny enough, that's why I disagree with you.
1918119	1919641	I think Nintendo has nothing to worry about.
1920061	1924246	Now, when I first heard this earlier in the week, I had the same reaction you did.
1924306	1925907	I was like, oh, Nintendo's fucked.
1925967	1929090	Now they're going to have this new thing with the motion control.
1929110	1930952	They're taking what makes the Nintendo Wii so great.
1931172	1932574	They're putting it on this new hardware.
1932874	1936217	Nintendo's screwed because everybody's going to want to go to the better looking games.
1936237	1936918	But I thought about it.
1936958	1937459	I thought about it.
1937479	1938279	I thought, you know what?
1938460	1939300	That's not really going to happen.
1939921	1959125	at the end of the day Nintendo is still going to have kids and soccer moms and that's who they've built their audience on that's how they built their system that's who's still going to be loyal to them remember people are not buying the Wii for the Wii they're buying the Wii for Wii Sports and at the end of the day Nintendo still has Wii Sports will this put a crack in it?
1959645	1966707	yes some of the fanboys and the hardcore a little crack might be put in Nintendo because of this but is it enough to shatter Nintendo?
1966767	1967367	absolutely not
1968047	1971028	Yeah, they're already too far ahead, but I think it will slow them down.
1971788	1975489	Because now they can't say that they have all this innovative control stuff.
1975569	1978630	Now they actually have to think on their feet and come up with something new.
1978890	1982691	I mean, that's really, I think, what they should be doing is coming up with something new.
1982731	1988252	Because now they've caught up to, you know, you can only be really innovative so long.
1988712	1990352	Now people have caught up to what you had.
1990412	1992073	Just like, you know, with Rumble and stuff.
1992113	1994433	People started implementing Rumble, now everybody has it.
1995014	1996734	It's like, you've got to come up with the next big thing.
1997174	1999176	And here's the thing.
1999336	2003058	Also, keep in mind, the motion is built into the Wii.
2003539	2006961	It is a part of every Wii game because it is what makes the Wii.
2006981	2010444	I mean, besides maybe a couple games here and there that decide to ignore it, but you know what I mean.
2010864	2013766	It is integrated into the Wii.
2013786	2014607	The motion control is the Wii.
2014827	2016868	With the Xbox 360, this is something extra.
2017228	2020631	This is not something that was not already in the system by default.
2020911	2021851	Power Glove, U-Force, Power Pad, and...
2045778	2048901	Video cameras, which we were just talking about, the vision cameras.
2048921	2051824	Yeah, but I think they would have done a lot better if they were bundled in with games.
2051864	2053085	Look at what Nintendo's doing now.
2053365	2053846	Wii Fit.
2053886	2057689	They want to sell a lot of balance boards, so what they did, they included the software free.
2058009	2063054	They wanted to sell a lot of remotes and stuff like that, so they included a game for $10 more.
2063074	2068719	I do want to say before somebody in chat screams their head off, some peripherals do break the mold and do well.
2069400	2069720	Guitar...
2070140	2073323	and Drum and DDR have all shattered.
2073343	2073963	The Wii Wheel.
2074263	2078347	You'd be surprised how freaking popular it is for a piece of plastic.
2079167	2083371	I mean, I don't... But for the Wii Wheel, we had a Lynx crossbow.
2083691	2084392	Here's the problem, though.
2084552	2092178	Okay, and I understand, you know, Lynx crossbow training, well, with the Wii Zapper, that sucked, and yeah, the Wii Zapper is a horrible peripheral.
2092698	2093199	The thing is...
2094201	2095604	Here's the problem Microsoft has.
2095764	2103358	All the people that wanted the Wii for Wii Sports and that kind of stuff, they're going to buy the Wii because it's cheap or cheaper.
2104431	2113298	But now, with Microsoft and stuff, actually, if they can come out with some sort of way to bundle in a sports game in this motion sensor, they might be able to pull it off.
2113318	2115861	But they're going to have to have a must-have game with this.
2115921	2118863	Because if they try to pack in Totem Ball, don't fucking bother.
2119444	2123267	Seriously, don't fucking bother Microsoft if you're going to put in a game of that quality.
2123287	2126730	They're going to have to put in a must-have game.
2127430	2131674	And they've got to be careful if they're going to try to be competitive with the Wii Sports thing.
2131954	2132435	You know what I mean?
2132455	2132975	Yeah.
2133075	2136257	They're going to need to have the must-have game with this in order to sell this thing.
2136577	2142721	I mean, that's how Guitar Hero and all those peripherals did well, is because they came with must-have games.
2143081	2145222	Link's Crossbow Training, not so much a must-have game.
2146483	2150405	DDR, pop culture icon of the late 90s, early 2000s, you know what I mean?
2150965	2153947	The DDR pads did fairly well because of that.
2155467	2166319	and also it depends Microsoft's going after Core Gamer they're trying to get into more of the casual game market Nintendo not so much anymore with the Core Gamer they just want to bring on new people that haven't played games
2167125	2168867	I don't think they're going to overshadow Halo ODST right now.
2168907	2170728	I mean, that's more of an announcement for next year.
2170768	2170828	And
2194345	2197646	They need something more than Halo because Halo is not going to bring in the casual gamer.
2199267	2202988	And to be fair, GameGuru said the same thing and said that's the game you need to put the X-Mode in.
2203329	2209231	I just, you know, I just think it would be if Halo 4 supports it, it'll help drive it.
2209251	2214213	But I just don't think, you know, I think they're going to turn off a lot of their Halo because there's some people that don't want this.
2215114	2216055	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2238869	2241650	I like to run and fill about and kill people.
2241670	2244070	I think the fitness bandwagon is where it's at.
2257813	2258934	EA Playground did it first.
2258954	2259294	Okay, whatever.
2284928	2285749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2304847	2315159	Well, the people that leaked the Forza 3 rumor have also sent in an image showing that there's going to be Perfect Dark on Xbox Live Arcade.
2316861	2321546	And so it could possibly be it has the same thumbnail image that Rare leaked in April.
2325805	2328806	Okay, I was just watching what Loki was doing with the controller.
2328846	2331608	Loki's playing on Excitebots right now, so it's a little bit distracting.
2331628	2332588	It looks a little perverse.
2332708	2335849	It looks like you're driving the Batmobile or something.
2335869	2337530	This is an interesting car.
2337630	2339631	Oh, it is an actual bat he's driving.
2340031	2341192	This game looks kind of fun, actually.
2343093	2355278	As I was saying, the thought overall is that there could be more rare Nintendo 64 titles coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, but there's not really enough to support it yet.
2356616	2357296	We have to wait and see.
2358876	2359116	Hmm.
2359977	2366578	I know there's a lot of Perfect Dark fanboys, and certainly I did not like that new one they had on Xbox 360, like their launch title at all.
2367438	2369878	So, you know, going back to the classics, I think it'll be a lot better.
2370038	2371059	No, it's also funny.
2371099	2380380	They also had Bean listed on there, which I don't remember if that's a... It was a codename for either the original Perfect Dark Zero or if it's the sequel to Perfect Dark Zero.
2381060	2382681	That was also listed on there, which is kind of funny.
2383361	2383981	And then, of course, Ash...
2385501	2385701	4 is the 3
2404517	2404577	Hmm.
2432622	2435643	Forza, not a racing series I particularly get into.
2435683	2439185	It's a little heavy for me, but I guess there's a lot of fans of Forza, certainly.
2439665	2442827	So I know there will be a lot of folks that are all about this at E3 this year.
2443307	2447529	Well, we have other big, big rumors, and this one has to do with portable gaming.
2447589	2454852	And yes, it involves the PSP, and apparently the rumor has leaked out about the new PSP that's going to be shown at E3 this year.
2454892	2456373	It's called the PSP Gauntlet.
2456533	2456893	Go!
2458054	2463116	Apparently the rumors are starting to snowball with this due to some one-up reporting from earlier this week.
2463676	2468599	According to some inside sources, apparently it's going to be getting a complete hardware redesign.
2468959	2474401	It looks to me like a cell phone with one of those screens that pops out like a sidekick.
2475021	2484606	I don't think it's supposed to be like that, but the way this thing looks is it looks like a sidekick to me where the screen kind of pops out and then you have the controller underneath it.
2485286	2487508	This is the silliest thing I've ever seen in my life.
2514449	2538011	it's going to be meaning no discs so meaning that the game will be entirely fueled and this is where the rumor has been going for a while now that there's going to be this PSP 2 that's fueled this way that this PSP Go is going to be fueled entirely off downloadable titles in fact over 100 classic and new PSP titles they are saying available at the systems launch one of the biggies Gran Turismo Mobile
2539215	2550364	I hope for their sake they're not doing this move in hopes that it's going to cut down on their piracy because I'll have them know all the PlayStation Network titles that they have available there are only for download only.
2550704	2553446	Those have already leaked out, and they leak out just as fast.
2553947	2564615	So they better hopefully fix whatever ways people have of exploiting their system and putting custom firmwares on because if they don't, this is going to be completely useless.
2565515	2566035	and DarkSakura.
2590622	2591383	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2613496	2619621	What's interesting about this, you're not talking about a hardware upgrade with this, which is what I find really interesting about this.
2619882	2621163	It's not a PSP2.
2621743	2623685	That's where I'm kind of like, huh?
2624105	2628089	At what Sony's doing here, because they're not taking this opportunity to upgrade the hardware at all.
2628709	2632931	And I don't really see the point of needing to hide the controls in there.
2632951	2638133	I mean, really, is there any reason why you need a sliding screen unless the screen is going to be touchscreen or something like that?
2638193	2638874	It's a look thing.
2639194	2644536	If I put a little protector on the screen, I can carry it around in my pocket and not have to worry about breaking the buttons.
2645237	2646097	It's just like a cell phone.
2646277	2648298	You concealed the keyboard underneath the screen.
2665390	2666351	I don't know, we'll have to see.
2667031	2670453	I'm sure if they're going to announce it, they're going to announce it at E3.
2671193	2675216	Although, I kind of find it funny that they've already revised their system like three times already.
2675896	2677397	They're just trying to find the perfect fit.
2678732	2679752	Let's read some comments from chat.
2679772	2681813	This is stirring a huge response in chat right now.
2681873	2683554	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to comment.
2684074	2689676	GoldAnthro in chat says, No UMD is fucking retarded and the downloadable titles will probably be DRM to hell.
2691157	2692797	DeathWishing says, I like owning cases.
2692857	2693358	That sucks.
2693798	2695658	HungryMister says, Oh shit, this is amazing.
2696659	2698360	TheRobD says, Yeah, that's interesting stuff.
2698400	2699380	It might be a good idea.
2699500	2701441	I don't know if storage can support it though.
2701821	2706763	That's kind of true too is that when you're talking about how many games are going to fit on 8GB.
2706883	2707483	The largest
2707483	2709788	This UMD game is 2 gigs.
2710839	2713760	So that you're talking like maybe... But most of them are not 2 gigs.
2713780	2715340	Okay, so maybe 7 games.
2716240	2721141	So there better be an easy-ass way for me to move games on and off this thing.
2721481	2724581	Like an iTunes-ish thing to manage my system.
2724942	2732143	That's the problem, though, is if you don't have high-speed internet, even still if you have high-speed internet, downloading a 2-gig game is going to take a long time.
2732203	2737304	And all these caps now, too, with Comcast and all this says 250 gigabytes and so on.
2737344	2738364	That could be dangerous, right?
2738644	2739465	Thanks for watching!
2748399	2748739	I don't know.
2748759	2752722	If it's all digital, it's just going to make it a little bit cheaper for them.
2752882	2754303	Let me get some other comments from chat real quick.
2754544	2758046	TigerClaw says, I prefer owning a physical copy of the game rather than a digital version.
2758527	2761809	Brad from PodCulture says, Not a fan of the no UMD deal though.
2762189	2763290	I think it looks kind of neat too.
2764131	2765852	Make the Switch and do something like Nintendo.
2765912	2766833	Put the game on a chip.
2767233	2769635	A slot wouldn't take up near the space that UMD would.
2772365	2780671	And at the same time, this is not going to really sell to people that, say, for example, own a bunch of PSP games already, because now they've got to replace them all or buy them again.
2780711	2782913	And really, do you think people are going to buy their games again?
2783213	2786295	I mean, that's wishful thinking, Sony, if that's what you think is going to actually happen.
2786876	2795982	Yeah, that's another thing, is that if I already own this game on UMD, there better damn well better be a way that I can transfer this onto my PSP without having to rebuy the game.
2796062	2796743	That's going to be...
2797483	2798346	Shitty, if not.
2798787	2801474	And I have a bad feeling that's where we're going.
2801494	2802838	Because how else is it going to know?
2802978	2805465	And there's no other way unless, I mean...
2807847	2808047	DarkSakura,
2837858	2841385	Download Game System Download Game System Download Game System
2847110	2847571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2870103	2878833	and I'm sure if they had a way to do standalone games they'd probably be selling games for it as well but that's the only means to get stuff on there and the fact that they're going to try to compete with that
2880031	2882493	It's kind of dumb with taking the UMD out of the picture.
2882853	2888758	Hitstun in chat says, Sky, apparently you can go to a store and they'll have a kiosk that will transfer your UMD game to a memory stick.
2888838	2889739	I hope to hell that's true.
2890099	2895964	Because if it's not, and I'm going to be forced to rebuy the game I already own on the PSP1, I will turn to piracy.
2896004	2896785	But here's the thing.
2898086	2900288	I hate to openly admit that on the show, but that's...
2900908	2901609	That's dumb.
2901629	2904871	That's even more retarded if they're going to do that.
2904951	2908394	What's going to stop Joe Blow from loaning his game to somebody?
2908674	2916640	I could buy one copy of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and loan it to 50 people and they can all get it dumped to their... Unless they use a key.
2918462	2919463	But not for old games.
2919543	2920384	Old games don't have that.
2920404	2922105	And each game isn't marked.
2922265	2923547	You can't tell one from another.
2923607	2924147	You know what though?
2924347	2930633	What about Joe Blow taking this latest CD that he bought at the store and his friend ripping it to his iTunes?
2932094	2933616	You know that happens rampantly as it is.
2934016	2937419	I know, but they're trying to figure out ways not to do stuff like that.
2937479	2942224	I mean, yeah, granted, we can assume that someone's doing that, but they're making it super easy.
2942684	2943625	It's just like, you know...
2944969	2949653	Rob, I can have you buy a game and then now we all have the game because you bought the game.
2949673	2953037	You know, I like that idea.
2953117	2954918	Here's my question to you.
2955339	2958842	If it was that easy and it was that open, would you steal the game?
2960632	2960932	Yes.
2961372	2968036	Because there's nothing easier than not driving to the store and not, you know.
2968596	2969697	No, I mean, seriously.
2969897	2974700	I don't understand you sometimes because you pay extravagant amounts of money for some games and other games you're just like, yeah, I'll just download it.
2975982	2977584	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3000526	3002087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3027808	3032852	And, you know, I blame Nintendo for not having demos for their... Well, they do have demos for their games, and I guess I could have tried it out online.
3033352	3033713	Big deal.
3033733	3036555	That still takes too long on the Wii, and really, I don't want to do that.
3038115	3038675	Thanks for watching!
3060000	3068429	Alright, I just wanted to present both sides of it for the people that get, you know, little angry clouds over their heads when you talk about piracy and all this stuff.
3068649	3070691	I want to be fair and present both sides.
3071712	3075296	And, to be honest, the last game I played on my PSP, I don't even remember when.
3075516	3076537	It was so long ago.
3077718	3078099	PSP.
3078419	3079700	The last thing I played on my PSP?
3080301	3083184	Rift Tracks for Twilight, and that was awesome.
3083905	3086288	Alright, that's going to do it for our PSP discussion.
3086449	3095000	If you want to call in about this later, I'm sure we'll get some calls about this a little later on the show, but we want to move on to some release dates and some non-rumors, things we know that are coming out very soon.
3095481	3096342	We'll start off in the UK.
3096783	3098325	Sorry, UK, nothing until the 12th.
3099006	3099447	What a bummer.
3100633	3101834	Must be a slow release week.
3102554	3103075	Or a non-release week.
3103115	3107457	I think that everyone's recovering from May 1st being a fertility holiday.
3107497	3108577	Isn't there a bank holiday?
3110058	3110478	That could be.
3110539	3110939	Maybe.
3111639	3113060	I think it was on the 7th or something.
3113180	3115921	Alright, well then so much for UK releases.
3115961	3116442	How about the US?
3118043	3119884	In the US, there's actually some stuff coming out.
3120864	3125668	This week, actually, it's very ironic that we were just talking about all these digital downloads.
3126288	3133973	Patapon 2, the digital download only, or you can get the little card to redeem it, is actually going to be available on PSP this week.
3135114	3136594	Also this week, we're going to be getting...
3137936	3160457	Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, part of the new Play Control re-release series on the Wii Fantasy Aquarium World, looks like shit, so don't buy it, it's on the Wii, really cheap though Puzzle Kingdoms, game from Zoo Games, actually created by the creators of Puzzle Quest and it's basically a rip-off of Puzzle Quest, but you can get that on the DS this week
3161478	3169361	Night at the Museum, Battle for the Smithsonian, that's going to be on Xbox 360, Wii, and DS this week.
3169641	3175683	Also, Jagged Alliance coming to the DS, which, man, that's an old game that they're porting over there.
3176523	3182665	Crysis, the Maximum Edition, I believe that's with Crysis Wars, the original Crysis, and the online multiplayer one.
3183445	3184566	That's going to be available for PC.
3185846	3211736	Destiny of Zorro coming out this week on the Wii Leisure Suit Larry boxed off his bus finally coming out on the PS3 if I need to remind you guys that got horrible reviews and apparently really sucked so keep that in mind and then probably the best one this week Klonoa coming out on the Wii which is pretty awesome price now $30 $30 you can't beat that um
3215091	3219376	and then of course, you know, to go along with that, you have to have a really crappy game.
3219736	3220877	Imagine Music Fest.
3222239	3223260	Imagine if I cared.
3224226	3226327	Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3
3247295	3255118	If you're into the Chinese rock and stuff, you might want to check this out because I do not believe there's ever been a DDR with Chinese music.
3255418	3259159	I know they've had Korean, they've had Japanese, of course, and American, naturally.
3259599	3261659	I don't know if there's been one before with Chinese.
3262260	3263920	That could be the first one, to my knowledge.
3264740	3266881	On the PlayStation 3, nothing this week.
3266921	3268181	It's a very slow week in Japan.
3268241	3269642	It's looking very similar to Europe.
3270342	3272483	Even on the Nintendo Wii, not a thing as well.
3272923	3276304	There's not a release coming up until May 14th when you have a winning XI game coming out
3277105	3292163	on the PlayStation 2 nothing this week either same thing on the DS it is a very slow week in Japan right now so not a darn thing being released except that DDR in other Asian regions so there you have it we'll have more to talk about next week hopefully so let's get back into some gaming news
3293257	3298142	Well, there is a little news regarding a particular bit of rock and roll royalty.
3298823	3303828	As in Prince, who is now, again, Prince and not that weird symbol.
3304429	3306712	That was actually incredibly brilliant on his part.
3308694	3309314	I won't go into it.
3309575	3310376	Look it up on Wikipedia.
3311236	3314100	But still, he does some serious drugs or something.
3314704	3316626	Prince Turn Down a Deal to Have His Songs in Guitar Hero
3336306	3346435	He has said that he doesn't have a problem with them, but he thinks it's more important that kids learn to actually play the guitar.
3346795	3351859	To put the effort into it and not have it just basically handed to you.
3352219	3355522	He was quoted as saying, to play music is one of the greatest things.
3356471	3363713	I agree with that, but at the same time, I think Guitar Hero and Rock Band gets people playing the fake guitars and gets them interested.
3363793	3364173	Thank you.
3364694	3366474	I'm like, stop being arrogant.
3366874	3369395	I mean, I understand.
3369415	3373476	I know plenty of people who play those games who have zero interest in learning the guitar for real.
3373996	3375237	They want the instant gratification.
3376057	3378938	Well, but it's better than no appreciation for music whatsoever, right?
3379656	3380096	You know what I mean?
3380156	3381518	It's the same thing with Wii Music.
3381558	3388124	Remember we had the same discussion when Wii Music came out about how, hey, as dumb as this game looks, if it gets kids interested in music, it's a good thing.
3388576	3400763	It's different for younger kids, which I think Wii Music would more appeal to, than usually the people who are buying Guitar Hero and Rock Band already have an interest in the music they'll be playing.
3402864	3410448	Now, one benefit with all the download content is being introduced to new bands and hearing new things, but at the same time...
3415066	3421953	I really don't think that it's a great introductory medium now for people learning about music.
3422173	3423935	We Music, I think, is a completely different animal.
3425376	3432664	I just think it's a darn shame that he feels this way because When Doves Cry would be the most epic rock band song, in my opinion.
3432684	3432864	Yeah.
3434121	3434581	It would be fun.
3434742	3435642	I would buy that in a heartbeat.
3435662	3436743	You know what would be better than that?
3436884	3437084	What?
3437704	3438305	Let's Get Crazy.
3438805	3438905	Or 1999.
3438945	3439686	That's more synth.
3440287	3441087	That would be fun too.
3441688	3448634	Yeah, but you know, since we're never going to get the keyboards, you know, they do synthy songs in rock band once in a while.
3449635	3450676	I just think it's a darn shame.
3450716	3452137	There's some pretty kick-ass Prince songs.
3452798	3457641	I wish they would just go above his head and go to Warner Brothers, which owns the old music, and just get it.
3457681	3465427	No, honestly, honestly, I would rather them get it from, get the permission of the artist, because that's more respect to the artist himself.
3465887	3469890	If he doesn't want his music in the game, he has every right to turn it down.
3470651	3474694	And if that's his reason... And I have every right to call him a cockknocker because of it.
3476204	3482267	If that's his reason and it's his music, like, I would be the same way with my art if it was something that I didn't agree with.
3482747	3497454	If I had done something... Now, if it was something that I was doing just, you know, like, corporate something or the other, and that's the purpose I was being paid for, yeah, but if someone saw something that I did and say, wow, I think this would work good in my ad for anti-puppies.
3498035	3500776	But I like puppies, so I say, no, you can't, you do that.
3500876	3502637	Or for, you know...
3503677	3505499	You made an ad against puppies?
3505899	3507600	What exactly is an anti-puppy?
3509281	3510182	A cat?
3510202	3512764	Well played.
3512984	3514665	Cats rule and dogs drool.
3514725	3515305	Love, Jamie.
3515786	3524612	If it was for something that I didn't really support on my own, then I would say no, and it would be my right because it's my work.
3524892	3525632	I agree with him.
3525713	3526513	It's his work.
3526713	3530656	He has the right not to support it with his work.
3530876	3533157	But I have the right to think he's kind of a douche because of it.
3533237	3534277	I mean, it's just fun.
3534477	3535578	We just want to have fun.
3535598	3544021	You can think that all you want to, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still... You're right, it's not going to change the end result, but... It's still his right to say no.
3544401	3553805	Luckily, though, for you guys, that Guitar Hero was put together so lazily that there are a lot of programs out there allowing you to create your own custom mixes.
3554065	3555206	I don't want to go to that kind of trouble.
3556626	3556886	I know.
3557147	3560588	I'm just saying that if you want to put the effort in, you could
3561744	3563866	Get your own Prince Guitar Hero.
3563886	3565887	Yeah, but I'm too lazy and that's what it really boils down to.
3565987	3567208	So what can you do?
3567348	3572512	Who would really want to own a Prince Guitar Hero?
3572832	3573413	I would not.
3574634	3576175	Unless it's like weird shaped guitar.
3576195	3577996	I would if you get purple velvet suits with it.
3580418	3583941	And if you get guitars shaped like that symbol, I actually might have to do it.
3585754	3595571	That would be kind of cool See, even Loki can't resist It's just because it's so ridiculous I would like to see one that would actually have clips of Purple Rain in it
3596414	3604139	Now the thing is, though, I want to see if they have, you know, available the, was it the Guitar Wolf microphones?
3604459	3607361	You know, the ones that shot fire out of them when you sang into them?
3607581	3609362	Yeah, that's cool shit right there.
3609382	3611003	Wait, is that like Dance Dance Immolation?
3612464	3612964	I don't know.
3613044	3616286	They have a Burning Man, the version of DDR that when you screw up it shoots fire at you.
3616306	3621710	But all I know is Guitar Wolf is awesome and the movie Wild Zero is retarded and, you know,
3622810	3623650	Thank you for watching!
3644149	3644850	Probably.
3645650	3649312	Hopefully it comes with a vacuum too then.
3649352	3660478	Glitter is one of those things, like if you throw glitter in your house ever, or you let somebody that has too much glitter on their body sit on your furniture, you will be finding that glitter like a year and a half afterwards.
3661159	3663300	Like, why is there glitter on my sofa?
3663460	3666321	Glitter sucks.
3666361	3670284	This week, Rock Band's actually getting quite a bit of content.
3671144	3677350	including a Franz Ferdinand 3 pack, which will include Do You Want To?, Lucid Dreams, and Take Me Out.
3678271	3679092	All those available for $2.
3680173	3685498	Separately are 160 Microsoft Points, or if you want to save 50 cents, you can buy the pack for 440 Microsoft Points, or...
3687657	3688177	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3708268	3710630	or Luscious Jackson.
3710730	3711451	I love that song.
3711511	3712652	That's one of the ones I'm going to buy.
3714574	3718078	Idealistic Types by Prong and The Banishment by Prong.
3718858	3721000	That's coming out this week.
3721881	3724724	It's not to play fanboy or anything here.
3725004	3725084	I'm
3726105	3741134	Really pro-rock band, but it's sad when you see, and we're going to probably get into Guitar Hero's lineup for next month or for this month, it's sad to see that what's coming out one week for rock band is about the same as coming out the entire month for Guitar Hero.
3743675	3745236	I still don't own Guitar Hero World Tour.
3745316	3745997	I don't see the point.
3746737	3752041	To be honest, all the songs I want to play are in Rock Band, and I don't mean to sound fanboy either, but too bad.
3752341	3761008	When I look at the list of songs in Guitar Hero and put it next to the list of the songs, including download content in Rock Band, Rock Band wins for me, and I don't see the need to own both.
3761148	3761488	I don't...
3762509	3766413	Now, the ironic thing, though, the guitar I own is a Guitar Hero guitar.
3766473	3769276	So if you're a Guitar Hero fanboy, just STFU, sit down.
3769716	3771057	I still own the Guitar Hero guitars.
3771578	3773840	But, yeah, I don't really care for the game.
3774621	3780286	And the best part about Rock Band, though, is there's a lot of songs available on their Rock Band store.
3780726	3783989	In fact, they have finally hit the milestone of 666 songs.
3784009	3784070	Yes.
3789834	3796401	666.
3791236	3796401	Was there a 666 song like Skinnered or Marilyn Manson, or what did they do?
3796421	3799845	Was there a celebration for the 666 song?
3801147	3804511	No, there wasn't, but I didn't see what exactly was the 666 song.
3804811	3806293	Oh, I guess it was...
3811898	3817722	It didn't really say, but as part of whatever Jane's Addiction's Nothing Shocking, one of those hit 666.
3818062	3820383	I guess Jane's Addiction works.
3820523	3821224	I guess I can see that.
3821844	3830109	At least it wasn't... But it would have been funnier if it was one of those... You know how they've done the SpongeBob SquarePants stuff and they had some of the Nickelodeon show or whatever?
3830429	3835132	It would have been funny if they had had Hannah Montana or something as the 666 song that came out.
3835192	3836453	That would have been pretty funny.
3837213	3838754	We Rock, Drum King, Rolling Stone
3860082	3861082	and Drum King.
3861462	3866144	And that's not because it has a deal with the actual band, the Rolling Stones.
3866524	3868564	It's based off the Music Magazine.
3868584	3869324	You know Rolling Stone?
3869364	3870305	It's a huge magazine.
3870325	3871485	It's like an oversized magazine.
3871765	3873965	They've been around for many, many, many years talking about music.
3874485	3877146	And yeah, kind of interesting that it's going to tie in there.
3877986	3880787	You're just going to have to have two Wii remotes for air drumming.
3881147	3882288	That's all you use in the game.
3882728	3884970	And it's being developed by ARC System Works.
3885590	3892915	And some of the songs that you can see in the game, We Will Rock You by Queen, Final Countdown by Europe, Song 2 by Blur.
3893075	3894036	There you go, DarkSakura.
3894056	3894876	I know you're a Blur fan.
3895577	3896257	Feel Good Inc.
3896317	3897058	by The Gorillas.
3897318	3899059	Wow, there's lots of... That makes me happy.
3899139	3901341	There's lots of Damon love in this particular game.
3901781	3904663	And such 90s classics as All Star by Smash Mouth.
3905244	3905804	So there you go.
3906304	3909887	Just some of the songs you can play in the Rolling Stone Drum King.
3910547	3912867	So that's a name change from We Rock Drum King.
3913208	3915028	So I guess it means lots of free ads in the magazine.
3915048	3915348	We'll see.
3916608	3916948	All righty.
3917368	3920969	A little more news for you guys before we take a break here on Orange Line Radio.
3922929	3927850	Well, there is a particular game that lots of people play just to make stuff in.
3928550	3929570	I am one of them.
3930711	3931671	It's actually The Sims.
3932071	3933471	There's stuff on Sims 3 out now.
3934471	3935912	There actually is going to be...
3937972	3948560	You get six pounds worth of sim points to spend at a Sims 3 store.
3949081	3953644	You can buy clothes and furniture and all kinds of other stuff.
3954145	3957587	You can get extra points in bundles of 500, 1,000, and 2,000.
3958608	3963972	You also get a game launcher, which is meant to be a hub for the Sims community.
3964393	3967295	So you can get information and downloads and uploads and stuff online.
3967535	3968016	5th of June, 5th of May
3987296	3987696	and DarkSakura.
4005748	4033011	you gotta come sometime sorry, 5th June which will have a full community and product site and a new town which you can download and some stuff but it's coming out for PC, Mac, iPhone and iPod Touch and I actually might have to play it on my phone so it can go you people suck I just will be happy as long as there's textures and stuff
4035202	4036966	I just want different ways to kill my Sims.
4037007	4038370	That's really all I want.
4038631	4039613	I want more haunted houses.
4039713	4043843	I want to make Silent Hill in Simverse.
4044642	4047083	I always liked making the elaborate death traps in The Sims.
4047303	4048964	So that'll be fun to do in Sims 3.
4049324	4055427	You know, I always like to build a pool with no ladder to get out and so they drown because they're not smart enough to just climb out the side.
4055767	4062371	I like going in debug mode and putting them up on the third floor of my house on a balcony that has no way out and a toilet.
4062971	4065472	So that they at least could go to the bathroom but they'd starve to death.
4066012	4069334	Didn't you try to build the diving board really high up into the pool?
4069354	4069874	Yes, on the third floor.
4069914	4073116	And what you were going to do is you were going to pause it while they were in midair and then take out the pool?
4074352	4078846	I wanted to do that, or I wanted to put the diving board out so that they, you know...
4079898	4097135	My favorite thing to do is just to make the human terrarium where you get all clear doors, glass walls, and then you get them to go into the room by leaving some chicken or something in there, and then you pause the game and add the other walls so that people can just watch them.
4097876	4098977	I know what I'm going to do.
4099918	4104902	You know this new one, they've got a lot of video editing features and that kind of stuff.
4106332	4106753	Saw.
4107514	4108476	Oh, God.
4108596	4110780	I wonder if we're going to get any more Strangerhood with The Sims 3.
4110820	4114086	Because that was pretty funny by the guys that do Red vs. Blue.
4115120	4117822	If I had more time, I'd say let's do like an OLR in The Sims.
4118022	4118423	That'd be fun.
4118463	4119824	We could totally.
4120044	4128751	I will never forget, however, the house that my old roommate built in The Sims where he put like... What was the most people he could have in a house?
4128771	4129292	Like six?
4129712	4134736	So he put five men that would all like make out with each other and kiss each other and all this stuff.
4134777	4137559	He put five men in the house and one woman...
4138019	4138800	Thank you for watching!
4158820	4159661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4176963	4177663	Good times.
4202989	4216220	and basically a quote from John F. Kennedy saying the world is very different now for man holds in his hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.
4217041	4224567	And people are thinking, huh, that's probably Front Mission now coming out on 360 or maybe the PS3.
4229722	4231484	I don't know.
4231524	4236450	Front Mission is a mech military strategy game.
4236510	4237691	It's more of a tactical game.
4238472	4240895	I think it would be very cool if they brought it out.
4240915	4242316	I think I have played this after all.
4242416	4245380	I think I did play this on another system a long time ago.
4247121	4247442	Interesting.
4248524	4255287	And also, apparently, I guess the same image was used at teaser, also in the official Xbox magazine, according to 1UP.
4255967	4262650	And it made very clear, or the teaser text made it very clear that it was going to be front mission for the 360.
4262690	4268233	You know, without saying that it is, they, you know, pointed their finger at it.
4269619	4270259	Soul Calibur Broken Destiny
4285749	4286470	Dampierre Wristblades
4307022	4307723	Soul Calibur Broken Destiny
4329455	4329635	Tekken 6
4351977	4357421	It's going to be on the PSP, though, along with the console version, so that's pretty cool.
4358021	4359903	Except it'll have some exclusive content.
4359963	4374012	It'll have certain items, certain stages, and a ghost mode, which means that you can download and share character data to play versus matches with.
4374593	4377975	So I guess sort of like how the conquest mode was in...
4380811	4386958	The old Soul Calibur in the arcade where we used to beat up each other's characters.
4388059	4390441	So it's pretty cool.
4390461	4391282	I'm looking forward to it.
4392544	4392764	Cool.
4394139	4395200	S&K The King of Fighters Online
4414563	4417524	No word on whether that's coming out over here as well.
4417564	4422766	I know right now it's supposed to be available in the Asian regions, and it's coming out on the first half of 2010.
4423386	4430029	I can't tell if this is actually a fighting game or a brawler game, but it looks good though, so that's kind of cool.
4432790	4433290	What's up with this?
4433310	4436891	Didn't we just have a King of Fighters shoot-em-up last week, and now we have an RPG?
4438212	4438692	I guess so.
4438732	4439492	They're branching out.
4440413	4440893	Interesting.
4441900	4443561	Why suddenly all the King of Fighters love?
4443641	4446063	I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a fun series, but it's a little weird.
4446103	4446564	I mean, really?
4446604	4447164	A shoot-em-up?
4447885	4448926	With fighting game characters?
4449266	4450067	A role-playing game?
4450967	4451388	What the heck?
4451788	4457653	This reminds me of the Mortal Kombat story modes and some of those, um, like, you know, the Mortal Kombat games they had on the Xbox and stuff?
4457673	4459574	You had those story modes that were really cheesy?
4460155	4461836	That's kind of what this reminds me of for some reason.
4462196	4463597	I don't know if it has anything to do with that.
4463758	4464018	I don't know.
4465396	4470659	Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week and the end of this half of the show.
4471479	4476722	You might have heard us talk about a game previously called Six Days in Fallujah.
4476862	4487927	It was a game that was going to be published by Konami, and the game had to do with one of the big battles that happened in, of course, the recent Iraq War that is actually still going on.
4488407	4489748	Well, Konami has pulled the plug on it.
4490975	4491576	with this quote.
4491836	4498942	After seeing the reaction of the video game in the United States and hearing opinions sent through phone calls and email, we decided several days ago not to sell it.
4499603	4505207	And that came from a Konami spokesperson talking to Asahi, which is a Japanese news site.
4506168	4516617	Don't know, though, if the game has been pulled entirely because, you know, the developers, Atomic Games, they could still put it out with another publisher, but this is certainly going to be a dent in it.
4518278	4519519	Some people are saying, you know what?
4519799	4520779	It was just too soon.
4522340	4523020	Do you think it was?
4523060	4524721	Do you think it was too soon for a game like this?
4526422	4526682	No.
4527763	4528463	It's relevant.
4530064	4532165	I mean, you wait any longer, it loses its relevance.
4532345	4534706	It doesn't have the same impact it would otherwise.
4535458	4535978	I kind of agree.
4535998	4536999	If you don't like it, don't buy it.
4537239	4542503	I mean, I went about this game because I don't like war games anyway, whether it's World War II or history wars.
4542523	4545405	There's very few of those types of war games I'm into at all.
4545525	4548427	So I just kind of looped this in with that category.
4548927	4556572	But these memories, there have been people that died in this war that has happened very recently.
4556612	4558493	I had a friend from high school who passed away in Iraq.
4558993	4559314	It's tragic.
4559334	4563236	And so wouldn't it actually be respectful to pay what they went through justice?
4563256	4564377	Yeah.
4564517	4564917	I think.
4565278	4573663	Oh, I don't have a problem with the game, but I'm just... This actually goes to me with a tendency of people to want to bury their head in the sand and ignore that bad shit happens in the world.
4574224	4574544	You know?
4575024	4580148	You know, people who just want to go, oh, well, that sucks, boo-hoo, Perez Hilton, oh my god.
4580828	4590932	You know, it's that whole, we want to look past it and not think it was really there by claiming that it's too soon or disrespectful or whatever.
4591032	4594874	But I think that people really need to have the reality of the situation driven home.
4595254	4599856	And what better way to do it than a video game that's based off of accounts of people who were there.
4600970	4601530	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4625163	4625824	See?
4626444	4626684	See?
4626724	4627585	And you're laughing.
4627645	4628726	I know, that's fantastic.
4629006	4629366	See?
4629707	4632029	But like, you know, that was the day she died.
4632169	4634611	But this wouldn't be meant to be humorous.
4634671	4635111	It's a different story.
4635131	4635932	No, I know, I know, I know.
4636012	4638294	You know, I'm a fan of shock humor.
4638334	4639014	Don't get me wrong.
4639254	4645439	I say that because we all have different ways of remembering things.
4645459	4648202	You know, and for me personally, I laughed my ass off at that joke.
4648522	4651484	But I loved Bea Arthur because I grew up on the Golden Girls.
4651524	4653506	You know, I remember watching that with my mother, you know.
4653686	4653986	I don't know.
4670037	4682570	Oh, I was saying that people probably take offense to the fact that the game, not only they spoke to, obviously, the soldiers that were fighting over there, but also the insurgents as well, including, you know, some terror cells or that kind of stuff.
4683111	4684772	So, I don't know.
4685413	4685853	Whatever.
4686214	4686274	It
4688234	4688734	Thanks for watching!
4706192	4706853	I wanna talk about Bea Arthur.
4735382	4735802	DarkSakura.com
4760273	4762755	No, the one I picked is, you know, eight years old.
4762915	4768798	Alright, so it's still... But I want to see if our people in the chatroom can figure out what it is based on the intro to the game.
4771440	4771840	Here it is.
4773021	4775682	James, honey, did something happen to you?
4776763	4778824	After we got separated in that long hallway?
4782606	4784828	Are you confusing me with someone else?
4789910	4792291	You were always so forgetful.
4792611	4794091	Remember that time in the hotel?
4797432	4797972	Maria?
4800633	4801933	You said you took everything.
4802833	4804974	But you forgot that videotape we made.
4807734	4808995	I wonder if it's still there?
4809035	4810915	Yep, we've got guesses already.
4810935	4812175	How do you know about that?
4812195	4812975	We're pretty close.
4812995	4814016	It's Silent Hill 2.
4815376	4816536	The Rod's the first one to get it.
4817116	4817717	Um, guess what?
4817737	4818397	You win something.
4819017	4819197	Hmm.
4821069	4829877	TheRobD, you win my TurboGrafx Wow, that was easy Yep I can even take it to him too
4831482	4831742	All right.
4832323	4833083	Get it to me next week.
4833103	4834144	We'll go take him to TurboGrafx.
4834164	4835105	We'll have to autograph it.
4835145	4838147	So, Rob, you win my no-controller TurboGrafx.
4840009	4841470	I didn't even know you were doing a giveaway.
4841790	4843832	That was the surprise.
4843852	4844453	Well, look at you.
4844713	4845013	All right.
4845814	4848936	So, I have to just remember where we put it.
4849136	4851338	Anyway, we've been cleaning.
4851658	4856742	So, yeah, Silent Hill 2 is the game du jour, or I should say of the week.
4859185	4866072	And the reason why I picked Silent Hill 2, even though this is not my favorite of the Silent Hill series, it's a lot of people's favorites.
4866572	4870416	So I wanted to throw the bone out to the big fans of Silent Hill 2.
4871037	4874320	So with this particular...
4876191	4882233	With this particular game, it's, you know, basically this guy goes back to the town of Silent Hill.
4883013	4884653	It's, you know, third person's perspective.
4884693	4889574	He plays this dude named James who is mourning the loss of his wife, Mary.
4889654	4892015	And he gets a letter from her saying to meet at their spot.
4892475	4893995	And instead, he finds Maria.
4894695	4898596	So, as the game goes on, it's pretty disturbing Silent Hill stuff.
4899157	4899837	Blood.
4900697	4901537	Pyramid Head.
4901817	4904618	And yes, this game is the introduction of...
4905618	4907560	By proper name, Red Pyramid.
4908201	4909162	Two of them, in fact.
4910103	4911924	So that's pretty awesome.
4911964	4913646	This is the game that gave us the Red Pyramid.
4915288	4918491	Or as you all know him as, Happy Funtime Rapey Pyramid Head.
4918791	4919231	P. Hitty.
4920132	4920613	P. Hitty.
4921313	4922374	That's what I call him, P. Hitty.
4922555	4923616	You know, we're tight like that.
4924227	4940204	Anyway, um, so, you know, you solve your little puzzles, and you pick up things, and you find things, and you get a chainsaw at some point, chainsaw is awesome, um, and, um, which I've seen Shane beat the game with a chainsaw, didn't he?
4941421	4942202	I wasn't there for that.
4957689	4970678	Um, you also have multiple endings on this game, so you've got up to, um, you have three endings, um, actually is it, yeah, three endings, I think, involving the actual story of the game.
4971759	4979984	Um, some of them are really fucked up and sad, um, some of them are, oh, there's one that's kind of happy.
4980405	4984808	And then you get joke endings, you get the UFO ending, which every Silent Hill game has, and
4985288	4987430	and then my favorite, the dog ending.
4991674	4999421	Of course, with the dog ending, it shows that a Shiba Inu is actually controlling the entire events of the game.
4999501	5001562	And of course, the UFO ending, James gets abducted.
5002543	5003624	There's also, though...
5005771	5005971	Yes.
5008693	5010013	This is the music from the dog ending.
5016737	5017577	I love the dog ending.
5017597	5018538	I love the dog ending, too.
5018918	5020479	I just like, he goes, what?
5020619	5021279	You did all this?
5021319	5022380	And the dog comes up and licks him.
5024240	5030324	I like that the dog, though, is wearing headphones listening to a karaoke music.
5033140	5036182	Sorry, I had my audio jammed.
5036322	5042126	At any rate, there's also some of the newer special versions.
5042826	5050791	Well, in the special edition releases, there is a game, a little side story called Born from a Wish.
5052472	5058916	And this is actually in the Restless Dreams edition, or for Europe, the Inner Fears edition.
5058936	5060057	What's wrong?
5060757	5061758	I just pricked myself.
5061978	5064239	Are you okay?
5087819	5090240	I just want to point out, this is a scary, scary game.
5090440	5096722	If you've never played a game like this before, you've got to try these types of survival horror games, especially the Silent Hill series.
5097002	5101283	Because I'm telling you, these games are so scary, they'll make your asshole slam shut.
5101623	5102564	You know what I'm talking about.
5102784	5107425	One of those games where you're so tense, you're like, oh my gosh, I'm so scared, I don't know what's going to happen next.
5108025	5110226	So this is a scary game.
5110486	5113027	If you think games can't scare you, play a game like this.
5113956	5116158	with all the lights off during a rainy night.
5117620	5125107	The biggest thing, and this is why I like the Silent Hill series so much, is that it's a big look into the disturbing parts of the human psyche.
5125147	5126048	That's why I like it.
5127309	5129811	There's actually an enemy in this game who...
5131933	5133654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5151950	5156874	Also, for the main character, you go into a room and he finds the dress that his dead wife wore.
5159876	5164560	And different things that relate to his psychosis, including the Red Pyramid being part of his psychosis.
5165620	5170644	The only character who does not see any of the monsters in the game is a little girl, because she is innocent.
5171084	5173806	She doesn't have those type of deep-rooted...
5175781	5177862	Even though I seem to recall her being kind of a bitch.
5201433	5205483	There was a character based off of Eddie Murphy when he was supposed to be more pleasant.
5205783	5210094	And a character named Angela who was based off of the protagonist in The Net.
5211753	5212994	Oh, I never realized that.
5213054	5213294	Yeah.
5213434	5213894	Interesting.
5214575	5222340	They've all been... And also, and this is something I didn't know, this layout of Silent Hill in the game was based off of San Bruno, California.
5224561	5228043	So it is, to me, one of the best games ever.
5228184	5229184	I love the soundtrack.
5229264	5235028	I actually used to wake up every morning to the theme of Lara, which was on that soundtrack.
5235668	5236129	Every morning.
5236749	5239591	Until I got sick of it and had to change it to The Birthday Massacre.
5241580	5246242	And also, if anyone wants to know about the movie, yeah, the second movie's coming, but Gonzo's not involved.
5246823	5248783	So, has nothing to do with the game, though.
5249604	5256687	Well, as far as this game and that story being involved together.
5256747	5258268	But yeah, Silent Hill 2 is freaking rad.
5259168	5259628	Play it.
5260889	5263110	And by the way, my favorite is Silent Hill 3.
5264751	5265051	All right.
5265950	5266210	SILENT HILL 3
5288976	5289416	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5311576	5313097	Stay tuned, because guess what?
5313377	5316138	The contest, you know, I didn't even know.
5316178	5318179	It was such a surprise contest we just had on the show.
5318319	5319260	I didn't even know it was happening.
5319640	5321701	But DarkSakura just gave away TurboGrafx-16.
5321941	5323182	That's not the only thing we're giving away tonight.
5323222	5329065	We are giving away a signed autographed copy of DDR on the PlayStation 2, signed by SmileDK.
5329525	5333347	And that's thanks to Bress Lowell, who got that at the SakuraCon.
5333707	5334667	So we're going to be...

5399618	5405062	So even if you don't know all five, send it in anyway, because if people can only get four of the five, you might still win.

5504242	5508983	Make sure the subject says contest somewhere in it or it will not count.
5509063	5509943	I can't stress that enough.
5509963	5513784	You need to put contest in the subject or something with the word contest in it.
5513824	5515504	You can put I love Rob, contest.
5515804	5518184	As long as the word contest is in there, it'll be cool.
5518544	5519005	So there you go.
5519945	5522665	The five songs for the contest this week.
5523125	5526526	Giving away an autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2 by SmileDK.
5526806	5529986	All right, I'm going to let you guys be able to talk and chat again.
5530046	5531467	So no giving away answers.
5532027	5532967	All right, no giving away answers.
5533715	5534015	There we go.
5534356	5534576	All right.
5536578	5536938	Okay.
5537979	5540642	I guess we're ready to get back into tonight's Orange Lounge Radio, so let's do it.
5540822	5549210	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the 3rd of 2009, where we tape live every Sunday night, of course, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5550311	5557678	On All Games Radio, www.allgames.com is where we tape our show and allow you guys to interact with us through ways such as chat and so on and so on.
5558038	5559139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5575988	5578789	is a game being shown off on the Xbox 360.
5580009	5583971	It's an alpha version of what looks like a remake of Turtles in Time.
5584531	5593114	And by the looks of it, you would probably guess that it's for Xbox Live Arcade, but of course, possibly could make its way to the PlayStation Network and WiiWare as well.
5593554	5598236	And it looks kind of cool, but definitely looks like Xbox Live Arcade material.
5602003	5603104	So, pretty cool.
5604026	5606188	I know this is a game a lot of people are very excited about.
5606228	5610674	Yeah, and it's alpha right now, so it could be a while.
5610874	5612316	I like that they've kind of re-skinned it.
5612356	5616000	It's not just a re-release of the game, but they've totally re-skinned the whole thing, which is kind of cool.
5616100	5616801	Yeah, it looks nice.
5618744	5620306	So, alright.
5620786	5621127	Very cool.
5621804	5622545	XBOX LIVE ARCADE
5647361	5647722	XBOXLIVE ARCADE
5666636	5673440	Yes, the Edinburgh Zoo renames their Wolverine in honor of Wolverine.
5673620	5674461	They named him Logan.
5676562	5683567	And I guess the tie-in that this has is that the picture that they put up is a picture of the Wolverine and behind him was one for the game Standy.
5684307	5693653	But they are using the, I guess, the fame of the movie right now to promote the fact that these are endangered animals, so...
5694787	5695748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5715540	5716861	I had lots to do.
5733875	5734215	It happens.
5735176	5735857	Alright, let's move on.
5736017	5736637	More gaming news.
5737038	5737238	Yes.
5738439	5738819	Let's see.
5738899	5743223	Well, we've got some other, well, kind of unfortunate news.
5744443	5748487	Also kind of tied in with the movies, you know, the whole Batman stuff, very successful movie.
5748927	5752630	Well, there's of course a new game coming out for Batman, Batman Arkham Asylum.
5752870	5754091	It's supposed to be out in June.
5754391	5757313	However, it's been delayed now to the end of summer.
5758334	5758715	D'oh!
5760006	5760346	Why?
5760546	5761667	Just because they can?
5762907	5772530	Basically, to give the devs an extra amount of time to make sure the game is the highest quality for gamers.
5774510	5776151	So, in other words, the game's broken right now.
5776171	5776931	It's got too many bugs.
5776951	5778271	They don't want to release it the way it is right now.
5778652	5779312	I guess.
5779572	5780492	That's what it sounds like to me.
5781572	5784073	Isn't it worth the wait, though?
5784093	5786114	If they're going to fix the problems with the game, it's worth the wait, right?
5786274	5786654	Definitely.
5788070	5789412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5811634	5812115	That they had.
5812155	5813895	That was the last one I really remember liking.
5814316	5816096	I guess I heard Lego Batman's pretty good, though.
5816116	5816957	I haven't checked it out, though.
5817257	5817657	Supposed to be.
5817677	5818397	I haven't played it, though.
5818497	5820498	I haven't played it, so maybe I'm not being fair.
5820618	5821079	So we'll see.
5821659	5822219	Hopefully soon.
5823119	5824240	Alright, moving on.
5826405	5842986	Lost Planet 2 is the game we knew was coming apparently some new footage has been revealed for Lost Planet 2 and apparently Capcom is trying to get a demo available for E3 and guess what not only is it going to be playable on the show floor at E3 but they are going to try to do one of those you know
5843466	5845608	Bring It Home type things on Xbox Live again.
5845628	5846409	They did with the first one.
5846489	5851793	Yep, and they'll release a demo during E3 for everybody to play at home via Xbox Live Marketplace.
5852594	5854375	And this is all from the Capcom Unity blog.
5854656	5860861	There's some new trailers, some new screenshots that you can look at, and they are hoping that there will be a demo
5861383	5862424	Available by E3.
5862484	5866245	By the way, there will be four-player co-op in the game, if you haven't heard yet.
5866585	5868406	And there's going to be a ranking system as well.
5868586	5871928	So you can compete for the biggest E-peen in Lost Planet 2.
5872308	5879071	Which looks to have ditched the snow for more of a... Looks like more of an Amazonian... Well, they didn't really ditch the snow.
5879131	5881412	It's just the planet's starting to thaw.
5882133	5882453	Oh, okay.
5882473	5884614	Which I guess there was a little bit of it in the first game.
5884714	5886595	They put it in a defrost setting in the microwave.
5886855	5890738	Apparently, because it does look a little thawed out this time, so it looks a little more jungly.
5891199	5897104	You do still see the snow in some parts, but it has more of a lush green look to it than last time.
5898683	5902944	Well, you know, there's other things that have, you know, a green look to them, and that would be zombies.
5904204	5904624	Zombies.
5905145	5906725	To be green or gray.
5906765	5909606	Well, usually they're red after dining on blood.
5909626	5910926	Well, enough blood on them, yeah.
5910946	5914567	But I mean the flesh tone, you know, it's kind of that green-gray sickly looking thing.
5915107	5917007	But there is news about Dead Rising 2.
5919508	5923229	When they said that there were going to be multiplayer sessions, well...
5925487	5929370	They were actually correct on that one.
5929910	5934014	Capcom said that there will be online multiplayer.
5934794	5936375	No details on it, but it said that there will be.
5937016	5937636	So that's cool.
5939518	5944161	Oh, the one thing that Dead Rising 1 was missing is going to be in Dead Rising 2.
5944442	5945683	That sounds pretty amazing to me.
5946263	5948425	As long as you can still run over Amina with a L'Amour.
5949626	5950126	Hopefully.
5950226	5950827	That's what I'm hoping for.
5950847	5952788	Well, they were showing off some pretty cool stuff.
5952828	5955190	Apparently the main character now, since he's not, you know...
5956371	5957272	A photographer.
5957372	5958973	He's more of like a carpenter guy.
5959013	5960593	He can kind of fashion his own weapons.
5960634	5966657	So he had like two chainsaws strapped to this giant stick.
5966877	5971680	And then he strapped two chainsaws to his motorcycle and drove through a crowd of zombies.
5971960	5973641	So he gets the MacGyverism skill.
5973841	5977523	Yeah, and apparently they had up to 7,000 zombies on screen at a time.
5979765	5981926	So that sounds sweet.
5982906	5985608	Another thing that sounds kind of sweet, actually, even though the first game...
5986974	5987935	Very disappointing.
5988415	5988915	Red Steel 2.
5989775	5994758	Red Steel 2 has been announced, and it's apparently going to the Wild West.
5995258	5998620	It's going to feature MotionPlus support.
5999220	6004302	I'm not really sure if it's actually a Wild West game, but the main character kind of looks like he could be on the Wild West.
6006761	6008041	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6036240	6039142	GS68 in chat disagrees, says no, Red Steel 2 will suck.
6064924	6067807	Actdeft says they'll probably bundle Red Steel 2 with Motion Plus.
6068987	6070209	Well, they're doing a lot of those bundles.
6070309	6071950	They gotta try to sell that Motion Plus.
6071990	6075133	So does this mean that Motion Plus is gonna be required for the game?
6075333	6076574	Yes, that's what they're saying right now.
6076594	6077214	Interesting.
6078776	6082479	So if they don't have a bundle with Motion Plus, aren't they severely limiting their audience?
6083897	6084398	I think so.
6084858	6090023	I would think the people that would buy this would not necessarily be the same audience that's going to pick up a game like Wii Sports Resort.
6090564	6093647	Well, MotionPlus is going to be sold separately, though, a month prior to that.
6093807	6096089	And they've also got a bundle with Tiger Woods.
6096369	6101554	They're also doing a bundle with EA Sports Tennis Grand Slam that's going to be...
6102615	6106356	or Grand Slam Tennis that's coming out before Tiger Woods even in Europe.
6107097	6108937	And who knows how many more bundles with this thing.
6108997	6111378	They've got to sell those Motion Plus things.
6111718	6118201	They've got to get people to realize, hey, you guys should spend another $20 on sensors that should have been in there in the first place.
6119461	6120021	Exactly.
6120041	6122822	And then we can come out with the controller with the sensors built in.
6122942	6123963	Ha, bitches!
6125720	6127342	Then they can think of something else they forgot.
6127702	6131444	Then it'll be, oh, but now you want to get the Wii HD so that our graphics can be on there.
6131464	6136387	You need to get the Wii Balance Board Plus because now it has more sensors and it's even more sensitive than before.
6136547	6139769	I bet you anything you'll see something stupid like that.
6141651	6143892	Well, haven't there already been rumors of a Wii Fit Plus?
6144092	6150256	Yes, there has been a Wii Fit Plus with the Balance Board, but I don't know if that's just the same Balance Board.
6150276	6151617	It might be the same Balance Board, I mean.
6152932	6156115	I don't know, have you ever tried controlling balance board games?
6156475	6157255	It's not very fun.
6157776	6159617	Just Wii Fit, and it works okay.
6160058	6160518	It's not that bad.
6160578	6161699	Like the marble rolling game?
6162320	6162880	Yeah, it's alright.
6162900	6164681	It's very, very sensitive.
6164802	6166323	It's very, very, very sensitive.
6166463	6170206	But I think because those games are supposed to challenge your balance, it's why it's that way.
6170626	6172508	I haven't played any of the standalone balance games.
6172528	6177592	There hasn't been anything that really, you know, caught my eye that I really want to get.
6179056	6179536	Adventure 2600 Reboot
6209957	6216203	and we're looking at a little YouTube here in studio what this game looks like and it's pretty cool because they actually have the dragon flying around and
6216820	6217600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6240427	6243329	and he had a whole little interview with GameSetWatch talking about it.
6244570	6245591	It was a whole team of people.
6245631	6250134	It wasn't just this guy but he was kind of the spokesperson talking about the project.
6250675	6251235	So pretty cool.
6253337	6254337	I might have to check this out.
6255038	6255778	Do you think you will?
6256059	6256319	For real?
6256339	6256959	I think I will.
6257039	6257440	For real.
6258420	6264885	If you want to find this it's at slashx.googlepages.com There's a whole little page about the Adventure 2600 reboot.
6265826	6267027	And I get the sense why?
6267507	6268528	Because we can.
6270182	6271584	DarkSakura is going to dive in.
6292392	6293013	Pye Pye Pye always wins
6312802	6314363	Okay, we actually have one from Dan Shadow.
6314743	6316784	Hey guys, what's more dangerous, chimps or raptors?
6316824	6317324	Help me out here.
6318125	6319585	Are these for real tonight?
6319826	6322787	I am serious, and I'm reading them because you fucking made me.
6323207	6323788	Oh, God.
6324948	6326529	Raptors, look at Jurassic Park.
6326589	6329551	Although, chimps can carry Ebola virus, like you saw in Outbreak.
6329571	6331071	You're thinking of velociraptors.
6331331	6331632	Yeah?
6331712	6333112	A raptor is like a hawk.
6333433	6335514	Aren't velociraptors a kind of raptor?
6338475	6340076	I think chimps are dangerous if you give them a gun.
6342079	6342439	RAPTORS RAPTORS
6362606	6367872	I would bet anything the emailer meant to say Velociraptors because raptors by themselves are not that scary.
6367912	6368913	But Velociraptors?
6368974	6369574	Terrifying.
6369594	6370595	They're carnivores.
6370676	6371977	And raptors the jets.
6372157	6374160	Those are pretty dangerous too, you know.
6374200	6375882	Skipping on!
6375942	6377523	Flying Velociraptors.
6377543	6378224	This comes from Gil.
6378945	6380006	and the monkeys the band.
6380026	6381066	I don't know how dangerous they'd be.
6381086	6383648	It's my first time writing in and I'll make it a short one.
6383688	6385489	What do you think about the new PSP Go?
6385969	6390011	How long until it will be hacked because the 3000s are not hackable to the public yet?
6390491	6392693	Should they release the hack or wait for the new PSP?
6394454	6398436	If they were smart they would wait for the new PSP to come out but they won't.
6398856	6400217	They've already got a sort of
6401479	6404621	Proof of Concept done already for the new PSP 3000.
6405181	6407122	Hacker groups are pretty competitive.
6407322	6412005	They don't want to sit on it and wait to have someone else beat them or else all their work is for naught.
6412025	6420869	But you will better believe that when that new system comes out, all they have to say is, it's unhackable, and then they'll be like, oh, we're going to get down on that shit, and it'll be hacked before you know it.
6421089	6422650	It may take a little bit of time.
6422730	6425892	The problem is it may have to use an exploit in the game to do it.
6427168	6432311	But it'll be interesting because if everything is downloadable, they'll start to sneak the patches in the games and all that.
6432431	6434332	So you'll have to patch.
6435473	6436113	It'll be interesting.
6437394	6438615	They're always going to find a way.
6438835	6440056	They're always going to find a way to hack it.
6440756	6442497	This one, ready for the next email?
6442998	6443178	Yes.
6443478	6447440	Hey, OLR, I was wondering if you guys buy the PSP 3000.
6447660	6450082	I've been thinking, okay, bad grammar.
6450615	6451636	I've been thinking about it.
6452056	6459220	I currently own four PSP2 Slims, and if that, I'm interested in your thoughts because tonight you're going to talk about the PSP.
6459681	6465124	Guy, it's Y-O-U apostrophe R-E, not Y-O-U-R, that's possessive, duh.
6465664	6471348	Maybe I should ust wait instead of just wait for the rumored PSP2.
6471408	6473669	Sorry for the late notice.
6473829	6475350	L-O-L-C-U in chat.
6475390	6479593	Sincerely, HungryMurcrunk.
6479893	6480734	Hungry Mr. Crunk.
6481314	6482475	Was that typed on a PSP?
6483095	6483415	I don't know.
6483435	6485417	But it says Hungry Mr. Crunk.
6485797	6487738	Or your OLR member, Columbia99.
6490280	6491021	What was the question?
6491161	6494043	There's only two periods in this whole thing.
6494083	6495344	Should he get a PSP 3000?
6495544	6498005	Not when you know that this PSP goes on the horizon.
6498906	6499566	I don't think so.
6499807	6500787	I wouldn't get either.
6501348	6505330	The PSP 3000 really only had the microphone built in.
6505891	6506051	Why?
6506071	6506271	Why?
6508681	6513124	If you really love your PSP, then wait for the PSP Go.
6513164	6517307	But if you already have a couple PSPs, which it sounds like you do, I don't see the point.
6518187	6522510	Again, this PSP Go is not going to have any additional hardware to it that we know of so far.
6522530	6524651	I mean, granted, they might come out and say something at E3.
6524671	6525932	Sure, buy one, help the economy.
6525952	6532977	Well, I love how they're like, oh, well, we don't want to add another analog stick to it because then that'll make certain games incompatible.
6533117	6537079	You're making them all download anyways, so they're going to be incompatible with whatever.
6537099	6537640	Just have...
6538736	6539817	Buy one and help the economy.
6539837	6540598	Ain't my money, so I don't care.
6540618	6541078	Send your money to me.
6541098	6541939	I'll stimulate the economy.
6541959	6542699	Oh, I bet you will.
6563030	6565892	Anyway, hey OLR peep shizzles.
6566573	6566813	Okay.
6567613	6574298	With all the rumors about the PSP 2 or whatever Sony will call it, I was wondering what are your top three features that you want for it?
6574938	6576099	Ooh, this could be a list list.
6577400	6585906	I personally would like a larger screen and separate mini USB device that allows you to load your UMD games onto it for playing games that you already own without switching disks.
6586546	6588828	Also, I would love dual analog sticks.
6588968	6590869	Much love, someone who dearly loves old people.
6592529	6594550	Wait a minute, didn't we already hear from somebody like that?
6594570	6595010	Yes, we did.
6596750	6599411	I'm sorry, I got kicked from IRC in the middle of that question.
6599431	6601172	Top three features for the PSP Go?
6601772	6603412	Yeah, that you would want to see.
6607373	6608734	I want a Tic Tac dispenser.
6609974	6610654	Made of bacon?
6611534	6614195	No, no, I want orange Tic Tacs.
6615516	6616016	I don't know.
6618279	6621867	You know, because they're not going to do much that they're not already doing with the PSP.
6621907	6622949	It's so hard to say.
6622969	6626917	Dude, they may as well add like a phone unit on that thing.
6627058	6627940	It looks like one anyway.
6629805	6635367	The number one thing I want to see is I want to make sure it's easy to download the games and get them on.
6635447	6637228	I want to see integration with my PC.
6637628	6643110	I want to see something that when I plug this thing into my PC, it has a cool little front-end system like iTunes.
6643150	6646431	And I got criticized for that earlier by somebody in chat saying iTunes isn't that great.
6646471	6647211	And they're actually right.
6647331	6653633	iTunes is not that great, but it still makes managing the device a lot easier than if you didn't have something like that at all.
6654013	6655414	I'm talking about something pretty...
6655794	6660075	for stupid people that will allow me to manage the content on my PSP.
6660215	6661655	That's what I would like more than anything.
6662015	6662835	Dude, soccer ball!
6663916	6665556	Are you watching Loki playing?
6665576	6667536	Yeah, I was watching Loki play because he's a soccer ball.
6667756	6668497	Well, that's my idea.
6669137	6669957	Loki, do you have anything?
6672057	6673138	Touchscreen would be nice.
6676378	6677318	A better web browser.
6679239	6679459	And...
6680421	6680741	Paygle.
6681322	6682323	More RAM, actually.
6682423	6683704	I think they should add more RAM to it.
6683724	6684324	I mean, who cares?
6684464	6690790	You know, just add a more beefy web browser, more RAM, and... Yeah.
6691490	6692251	Touchscreen would be nice.
6692751	6693972	Xlink in chat says porn.
6693992	6695013	PSP needs more porn.
6696054	6697015	There's plenty of porn out there.
6697035	6698296	Plus, you can convert it all.
6699137	6700818	Well, plus the thing gets on the internet, right?
6700838	6701699	That's all the porn you need right there.
6701719	6701879	Exactly.
6701899	6703140	That's why you need a better web browser.
6704621	6705542	It should have a GPS.
6707076	6707676	That might be neat.
6708296	6713037	And it should have, instead of a Tic Tac dispenser, an Altoid dispenser.
6714077	6715518	And apps like the iPhone.
6715738	6716558	Open-end development.
6716758	6717598	And the Tamagotchi.
6718218	6719119	That's on my list, too.
6719259	6719979	Open-end development.
6720499	6726620	It should have the little tiger games on there, like football and all those games.
6726840	6727960	Alright, we've given more than three.
6728841	6730021	This listener should be satisfied.
6730601	6730881	Okay.
6732841	6735562	Dear God, whoever wrote a novel... Oh, that's Actdeft.
6736610	6736890	Okay.
6738651	6739631	Hi, OLR.
6740152	6744094	This is your friendly and swine flu-free neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.
6744354	6748035	Can I just say, swine flu, what the hell?
6748636	6750357	People need to stop it.
6751137	6753418	Stop it with the swine flu garbage.
6754118	6756520	More people die from lots of other things.
6756580	6756780	Like...
6758074	6758614	Oh my god.
6759695	6766898	And I'll admit, at first, if you go back and read my Twitter, at first I was kind of like, eh, because I was worried that it was actually going to be an outbreak, but like, you know what?
6767178	6767618	It's not.
6767898	6769299	More people die from the regular flu.
6769419	6771920	It's not as big of a deal as people were making it out to be in the beginning.
6772080	6772600	Knock it off.
6773901	6776342	And you can eat pork and not get swine flu, by the way.
6777383	6785186	It made me want to cry when there was an actual caption on CNN saying you do not get swine flu from eating pig.
6787077	6789798	I just think it's an excuse for people to use swine in everyday conversation
6808585	6809746	Since this swine flu thing came out.
6809906	6811728	I'm going to go get pork chops.
6811768	6812208	There you go.
6812508	6816852	He actually said on the news, if people will just eat a pork chop a week and some bacon, we'll all be fine.
6816892	6820775	And I'm thinking in the back of my head, boy, Loki's probably sitting there watching this going, no problem.
6821876	6822736	I'm not sitting there watching.
6822776	6823357	I'm eating pork.
6824518	6832664	I think all our listeners, unless you are Muslim or Jewish or any other religion that doesn't allow you to eat pork.
6832764	6833825	Or vegetarian or whatever.
6833845	6834686	Or vegetarian, whatever.
6835973	6838834	Go to your local IHOP and order a bacon platter.
6838894	6839194	That's right.
6839214	6840554	Please help keep my uncle in business.
6841434	6842874	Go get some bacon right now.
6843274	6844755	Unless, you know, Jewish, whatever.
6844855	6851336	Everyone get together and just do the bacon march and hold up banners that say, Bacon does not give you swine flu.
6851456	6851756	Eat up.
6851836	6853737	Bacon is meat candy.
6853917	6854777	H1N1 be damned.
6855097	6855937	I heart bacon.
6856497	6857937	Bacon is meat candy.
6859238	6861838	I need a shirt for ASEN that says I heart bacon.
6862198	6863299	Can I get that quickly?
6863659	6864239	I bet you could.
6864259	6865619	I have a shirt that says I heart bacon.
6866243	6867424	Can I borrow it for ASIN?
6867444	6868285	No.
6868326	6868886	Oh, damn you.
6869407	6871289	That, of course, was only half one.
6871609	6871910	Alright.
6872631	6873332	I'll figure it out.
6874153	6875074	Hi, OLR.
6875114	6876756	This is your... Okay, I already read that part.
6877997	6883684	As we may already know, Harmonix is going to release some Rock Band games to expand the franchise.
6884685	6887546	Though what I don't get is why people are bitching and whining about it.
6887686	6897968	First of all, all those that are saying that Harmonix is trying to milk the franchise and are going the way of Activision, look at all the Guitar Hero games that have been released and all those to come in the near future.
6898308	6904569	Guitar Hero Metallica, Smash Hits, Van Halen, On Tour Decades, and the arcade game, just to name a few.
6904889	6907990	By the way, the movie theater had a Guitar Hero arcade, just thought I'd let you know.
6909351	6912634	Now look at what Harmonix has released or will release at the same time span.
6912734	6916779	ACDC tracks, Unplugged, The Beatles, Lego Rock Band, and that's it.
6917359	6921043	Guitar Hero has overloaded the market while Rock Band is expanding its current market.
6921423	6927850	Not to mention that you can export tracks and play DLC in whatever Rock Band game with no problem except for The Beatles and Unplugged.
6928471	6929752	And we don't know about Lego yet.
6930569	6943364	while with Guitar Hero you have to own every disc to be able to play every song you have on them not to mention changing discs every time you want to play a song that's on another disc yes I know this isn't a problem for some but it's still something that would be more quick and useful
6946505	6951387	To top it off, people are also asking, why Rock Band Unplugged on the PSP?
6952007	6953048	Where's the reason on that?
6954028	6961671	Well, the reason is that if they had more info on it, they would know it is a spiritual sequel to Frequency and Amplitude made by Harmonix nonetheless.
6962292	6969695	No instruments, just press the buttons, and according to what the track is, and of course, according to the rhythm.
6970575	6974257	And the new songs featured on it will be on the Rock Band Music Store for consoles.
6974698	6983283	Also, Unplugged will have its own music score, not like Guitar Hero on Tour, in which you need the peripheral to play and you can't play on Tour on your DSi.
6984064	6989027	And not to mention the awkwardness when you're playing it with EndNote, DLC, whatever.
6990086	6990826	Sorry, whatsoever.
6991707	6994528	To sum it all up, Rock Band is not turning into guitar heroes.
6994568	6995568	Stop bitching about it.
6995848	6997029	Harmonix knows what they're doing.
6997069	6998810	That was all in caps, but I feel like screaming.
6999550	7003472	Sorry if this email is a long FU rant, but I need to get it off my chest.
7003892	7006093	Thanks for reading and for listening to your listeners.
7006533	7007233	Smile face.
7007253	7010114	Happy face.
7010134	7012335	You just, you did the smiley, my favorite smiley.
7012956	7013236	Okay.
7013256	7013896	Mm-hmm.
7015009	7020085	I agree that Rock Band isn't milking it as bad as Guitar Hero, but I worry that it might be going that direction.
7020185	7022392	If this Lego thing will not let you import songs
7024480	7025060	It's not going to.
7025100	7025940	It's a different publisher.
7026581	7027781	I think that's the only reason.
7027821	7028761	Oh my god, my mic wasn't on.
7028801	7029041	I'm sorry.
7029322	7033583	I was going to say, if this rock band will not let you import songs, I'm going to be very disappointed.
7033603	7034183	This Lego one.
7034463	7036404	I don't think rock bands jumped the shark as bad as Guitar Hero, though.
7036424	7037544	I'd be surprised if they let you.
7037984	7042366	I think there's going to be too many problems because it's a different publisher, but if it were the same publisher, I'm sure they would let you.
7042966	7043746	Same with the Beatles thing.
7043766	7045287	The Beatles thing, they have a special deal there.
7045747	7047307	It's, you know, Beatles only.
7047507	7052269	If they come out with a Rock Band 3, you better believe all that stuff from the other games are going to be, you know...
7053129	7053689	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7081531	7085233	and in place, you're getting these standalone games that you have to spend $60 for.
7086414	7086794	No thanks.
7088155	7089456	But again, those are optional too.
7090636	7092617	Also, I want to make a comment about emails.
7093098	7101282	Henceforth, unless I feel otherwise at the moment, if I get any more emails during the show, I'm probably not going to read them until next week.
7101443	7104925	So, you may as well just understand that.
7105825	7106365	Yep, good idea.
7107026	7108867	Anyway, last email comes from Cheeseburger.
7110199	7114142	Hey guys, sometimes you talk about how you need to stop getting on random tangents.
7114502	7119085	Well, I would just like to say that I would not listen to OLR if not for the personality from each host.
7119426	7123389	Random food news and political talk are just random tangents about randomness.
7123769	7125690	I've never seen random you so much in a sentence before.
7126491	7131014	Anyway, that's what makes OLR different from other video game shows.
7132235	7134817	Sometimes I'm not in the mood for just straight video game news.
7135137	7136278	Sometimes I want a good laugh.
7136318	7137199	Keep on podcasting.
7138493	7142559	Keep in mind that the bitching about tangents is also part of what makes the show the show.
7143421	7144883	So it all goes hand in hand.
7145244	7148909	Brought to you by Halo 3, home of the never-ending four-year-old rocket noobs.
7151674	7152135	It's over!
7152930	7153450	Thanks for watching!
7177782	7178383	Thanks for watching!
7193884	7195125	That's the deal there.
7195165	7198088	I mean, the developer doesn't really matter if it's going to be in the same series.
7198488	7200930	It's just like Guitar Hero has been developed by a bunch of different people.
7200950	7208716	I mean, it's been Harmonix for a lot of it, but then now they have... I don't remember the last developers doing a new one.
7208916	7209577	For Guitar Hero?
7209597	7210117	Neversoft.
7210217	7210978	Neversoft, yeah.
7211378	7211618	So...
7213733	7215054	Yeah, it's not developer, it's publisher.
7215354	7217355	And because it's a different publisher, it's not EA.
7218315	7224939	If EA was putting it out, then yeah, I'm sure they could do some sort of way to port that stuff over.
7224999	7228520	But because it's Warner, it's a little different.
7228780	7229101	I don't know.
7230041	7237986	But also because it's Warner, it may have some good music in it because they do have the Warner Music license.
7239107	7243510	Anyways, kind of completely off the topic of Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
7245071	7245572	1 vs. 100.
7245892	7255338	You may remember that they kind of teased this actually last E3 when they were showing the brand new Xbox interface.
7256319	7257279	Now, of course, the
7258140	7259821	Thank you for watching!
7275012	7287900	So, um, they have a little teaser trailer for it, and of course, you know, you're going to be able to play with your avatars, um, play as part of the, you know, the mob, or the person actually playing the show, or as the audience.
7288440	7292082	So that looks kind of cool, and they're going to be doing, you know, we can win real prizes.
7292363	7293403	So, I mean, sounds like fun.
7293843	7295925	How do they pick the person that's going to be the one?
7296205	7296725	I don't know.
7296825	7297526	That's interesting.
7298246	7298326	Yeah.
7298346	7298446	Yeah.
7298466	7298566	Yeah.
7322802	7325325	So, it'll be interesting to see how it works.
7326165	7328628	But I'm sure we'll see more about it at E3.
7328888	7330369	Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see more about it too.
7330710	7332812	You think it's not going to release to the network before E3?
7333232	7335795	It might actually, because it's supposed to be coming this month, I thought.
7335955	7336656	That's what I thought too.
7336916	7338257	Or last month, April, wasn't it?
7338577	7338998	No, it was May.
7339258	7339538	Oh, me.
7340198	7340599	Interesting.
7341219	7344580	So maybe we'll see it just before E3 and we'll hear about the next game show at E3.
7344700	7345381	Yeah, maybe.
7345761	7349842	Or maybe they're going to hold it off until June and then announce some more stuff at E3.
7350683	7353084	I'm afraid of embarrassing myself with my lack of knowledge.
7353644	7354464	Here's my question.
7354504	7358066	How are they going to prevent people from having a laptop right next to them Googling all the answers?
7358346	7358586	I don't know.
7358626	7359446	That's what I want to know.
7359466	7366649	Because one of the questions they show off in the trailer, they're all, you know, the director of 300 also directed what other movie?
7366689	7367210	And it's like...
7368911	7370851	Watchmen, they gave two other ones.
7371752	7372052	Really?
7372672	7373373	You don't know who?
7374373	7375054	Some people wouldn't.
7375714	7376534	A lot of people wouldn't.
7378395	7380776	Nerds do, but other people don't.
7381317	7383118	Seriously, you could totally Google that stuff.
7383138	7385719	Unless you're going to be given a certain time limit or something.
7387301	7392325	Because it's not going to be like the TV show where you can just sit there going, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
7392345	7395487	Uh, Tiger Claw says, didn't 1 vs. 100 get cancelled on TV?
7395567	7395988	Yes, it did.
7396648	7404234	Uh, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, says, uh, you were also scored on time, so they can Google it, but they will get a crappy score.
7405455	7405876	Interesting.
7406476	7407937	How is that going to play into it on 1 vs. 100?
7407977	7410279	I guess I'm going to have to see how it kind of looks.
7411100	7412641	So, there you go.
7413735	7416417	Furniture racing, card boxing, log cutting, mud sliding, tuna tossing...
7443191	7445372	Cheese rolling and extreme ironing.
7446032	7448172	These are all real sports, too.
7448612	7448912	What?
7449313	7451033	These are all real sports from around the world.
7451313	7452153	Cheese rolling, yeah.
7452313	7455554	I think I've heard of cheese rolling, but tuna tossing?
7455574	7456214	That sounds dirty.
7456334	7458975	That's like toss your cookies.
7459155	7460515	That's from New Zealand, I think.
7460555	7461475	New Zealand or Australia.
7461516	7462096	It's one of those.
7462136	7463896	Are they going to have an event for tossing your salad?
7464496	7465496	No, that's not a sport.
7468530	7469330	For some it is.
7469970	7471971	I'm afraid to say it's not a sport.
7471991	7473651	It's just like DDR will never be a sport.
7474791	7475472	For some it's a sport.
7475532	7477252	Tossing your salad would be a hobby.
7478252	7480313	They don't have any leagues for that, okay?
7480333	7480773	I'm sorry.
7480793	7483133	Well, maybe someone should start one.
7485194	7487374	Yeah, that'd be a big step backwards there.
7488495	7490355	I'm just looking forward to Extreme Ironing.
7490435	7491535	How is that a sport?
7494096	7494436	I don't know.
7495506	7497007	How is it not a sport, Rob, huh?
7497127	7497548	I don't know.
7497588	7498088	I'm sorry.
7498108	7501891	I could say, so I could say, you know, instead of get back to work, get back to training.
7502011	7505174	I'm looking at the trailer here, by the way, if you want to know what the noise is you hear in the background.
7506495	7506775	Wow.
7506795	7507816	That guy looks like Naruto.
7508256	7508657	He does.
7509657	7510738	That car just fell apart.
7510878	7512800	Like Naruto and Wario had a baby.
7513100	7514241	I think it was towards the end here.
7514261	7515282	They had, yeah, here's that.
7515302	7517323	The guy's doing the tuna tossing and there's the cheese.
7517564	7518244	I've seen that.
7518304	7519345	I've seen the cheese rolling.
7519505	7520246	That I've seen before.
7522287	7527288	But then they have the extreme ironing here towards the end, which I just did not recognize at all.
7527308	7528389	I was like, what the hell is this?
7549218	7550839	No, I guess so.
7551820	7554202	There's a whole little article here on extreme ironing.
7554943	7559706	A performance art in which people take an ironing board to a remote location and iron items of clothing.
7561007	7566712	The latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt.
7568193	7569034	Oh my god!
7569414	7575959	There's this person ironing on top of a big rock in the middle of fucking nowhere.
7576720	7577721	This is amazing!
7579212	7581093	I didn't know shit like this existed in the world.
7582114	7582354	Rob.
7582514	7583275	I want to do this.
7583615	7585416	Everything exists.
7585557	7587018	I could be an extreme ironer.
7589039	7592281	All I have to do is climb the fucking rock and then iron a shirt at the top of that.
7592382	7592882	That's easy.
7593062	7596605	I do my ironing in a rotating cylindrical container with heat.
7597245	7598046	You know what that's called?
7598606	7599347	My dryer.
7602469	7603570	Wow, that's pretty cool.
7604370	7606412	How about something else that has to do with rolling, Rob?
7606532	7607713	They call them ironists.
7609460	7610280	How about more rolling?
7610300	7610781	Alright, fine.
7610981	7612301	Rolling and rolling.
7613982	7617424	What is our favorite thing to roll ever?
7617504	7617844	Cheese?
7619104	7620425	Sushi?
7621445	7621766	Money.
7622526	7623686	How about Katamari?
7624487	7625427	Yay!
7626408	7628909	Oh yes, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we love Katamari.
7628929	7629549	Rob.
7629569	7630149	What?
7630169	7631270	What?
7631730	7633891	You're scaring me.
7639537	7640277	Read your damn story.
7659986	7665850	Katamari is going to be on PS3 with Katamari Forever, which I believe we might have mentioned before.
7665990	7667791	We mentioned the Japanese one, yeah.
7668111	7672994	Well, there's a trailer out with different wild animals making commentary on it.
7674355	7680059	The cool thing is that it's going to have different features available for it as far as visual filters.
7680599	7683261	You get a wood grain, a cell shaded...
7683681	7687282	A Color Pencil, and then the normal version.
7687722	7693004	Also, this, of course, has no involvement from Keita Takahashi.
7694244	7701467	But what I got from watching the trailer is that you're actually going to be able to, well, roll up entire planets.
7702667	7703807	And roll up the universe.
7705428	7707469	So that's kind of interesting.
7707549	7709969	I saw it rolling up, you know, the Earth.
7711290	7711970	It was pretty crazy.
7712745	7713305	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7737777	7738978	DarkSakura DarkSakura
7770722	7772403	I'm successful at life, thank you very much
7795586	7817314	so yeah lots of interesting stuff going on including PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe is actually coming to the PSP you know we've been talking about a lot of different games coming to the PSP this might be the year of the PSP although last year was supposedly as well the year of the PSP as well
7818373	7818913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7847577	7848959	Everyone loves their tower defense games.
7849940	7852683	I guess, although they've kind of been jumping the shark as of late.
7852723	7857669	I mean, it seems like they all have one, especially the Final Fantasy tower defense game, although it's kind of fun, I've got to say.
7858230	7862134	But, you know, that's on every system and, you know, pixel junk and so on and so on.
7862595	7864117	So, I don't know.
7865819	7868780	Well, obviously, swine flu has been all the rage this week.
7868820	7870201	I can't believe I'm reading this story.
7870261	7872182	But swine flu has been all the rage this week.
7872202	7877484	But did you know that swine flu has actually existed in the World of Warcraft for quite some time?
7878244	7878685	That's right.
7879045	7884027	World of Warcraft has seen the swine flu for a little while now, ever since they released Wrath of the Lich King.
7884527	7888449	It's these pigs in Borean Chandra, which is in the new area of Northrend.
7888789	7889149	www.DarkSakura.com
7908425	7913129	So it's really Blizzard that has caused the swine flu.
7913290	7915251	Yes, it was Blizzard's fault all along.
7915552	7918955	And the fact that I'm even talking about this story makes me cry inside a little bit.
7919135	7923138	And when I get hurt by the stories that we read, that makes us very angsty.
7923299	7924740	And that's when the FUs of the Week happen.
7940765	7942416	DarkSakura, your FUs of the week, please.
7942825	7950147	My FU goes to Citrus Heights Cops, just in general, because they really like to find reasons to give you a ticket.
7950247	7966031	I had one tailgating me, well, practically tailgating me on the way here, I guess waiting for me to speed or something, and thankfully someone decided to jaywalk right in front of us, so the cop turned on the sirens and got the jaywalker.
7966831	7971612	Still, a bit, uh, I feel like they don't have enough to do or something, but anyway.
7972881	7973161	Loki!
7975042	7978004	Yeah, FU goes to, I guess, police as well.
7979145	7979906	It's kind of funny, though.
7979926	7985669	You see them turn on their sirens or whatever and see who pulls over to the side and they give them a ticket.
7986230	7987070	I'm not sure why.
7987611	7992494	Not necessarily people speeding, but people think that they want them to pull over and then they get a ticket for some reason.
7994515	7997537	I don't get tickets, though, because I can see them sitting there.
7999819	8000099	That's it.
8001164	8003366	Am I the only one that doesn't have police issues this week?
8003386	8009611	Well, I didn't really have anything other than sitting in, you know, driving the Oakland sucks, so.
8010612	8013835	F you to the fact that everything seems to close at like 10 o'clock in this city.
8015109	8019732	I was out in Roseville last night trying to find some late night eats and everything was freaking closed.
8020353	8022594	So F you to stores that close early.
8022855	8023875	It's annoying.
8023995	8025096	Oh, I'm sorry, Loki.
8025276	8027158	F you to the finale of Heroes.
8027198	8027818	It sucked.
8028519	8032281	And what they did with the villain in the series is retarded.
8033442	8033842	Interesting.
8034563	8036104	I'm eight episodes behind on Heroes.
8036144	8036824	I kind of gave up.
8036925	8037345	You're going to...
8038902	8039162	DarkSakura
8067202	8075585	Well, there is a teaser that was put out on the Pokemon Sunday TV show that's on TV, of course, in Japan.
8076405	8080727	And they were saying that there would be a remake of Pokemon Gold and Silver.
8080747	8087609	They said that they would have a world-exclusive first announcement on the 10th of May.
8088189	8090690	So maybe that's it.
8090910	8092091	It could be a rumor.
8093011	8099997	Um, but they were showing, um, gold and silver confetti balls, so that could possibly be it.
8102319	8103900	I didn't want to see their gold balls.
8104620	8107162	Wherever they can milk for money, they will.
8107683	8108784	Ooh, Scorpion.
8111929	8114131	www.justin.tv slash orange lounge radio
8137287	8137748	Atsuku Atsuku Atsuku
8151721	8156184	Akatsuki Rising Akatsuki Rising Akatsuki Rising Akatsuki Rising
8175891	8180335	Okay, yet another, is this related to all the other Naruto games in the world?
8180355	8181376	God, there's so many of them.
8181396	8186660	Well, I think this is going to be like the... Shippuden is basically what people are referring to as the time jump.
8187340	8189322	Oh, yeah, so he's a little bit older in this.
8189602	8198950	But they've been doing the Shippuden games, like they did Ultimate Ninja 4, which is Shippuden, and then they have a new Shippuden game for the DS that's coming out.
8200626	8201668	Next month, I think.
8201848	8209879	And then this one's going to be another fighting game because they've been doing PSP Naruto Ultimate Ninja games like the Ultimate Ninja Heroes series.
8210299	8213624	But now, you know, kind of going along with the whole shipping and stuff.
8213644	8216147	You know, why not?
8216247	8216848	It looks pretty good.
8218371	8221772	All right, well, a couple more new games that are coming out in the future.
8222472	8224113	This is going to be coming out on the DS this winter.
8224153	8231816	If you're a fan of the Phoenix Wright series, which I guess you could really call the Ace Attorney series, there's a new game coming out called Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.
8232416	8233856	It's not going to be like the other games.
8233916	8237678	This is more about investigating the crime scene, not so much in the courtroom.
8237698	8243340	You're actually going to become Miles Edgeworth, and you're going to investigate crime scenes, trying to find the truth.
8245216	8246677	So it's a weird CSI type thing.
8246777	8247237	I guess.
8247297	8250578	You're actually going to be on the crime scene as Edgeworth looking for contradictions.
8250938	8255620	You identify clues and question material using logic and gathered evidence.
8255800	8257941	Of course, there are several episodes in this game as well.
8258461	8261482	The first one is a murder that happens in Edgeworth's office.
8262083	8262463	Interesting.
8263703	8267805	By the way, this game is teen rated and it's supposed to have 15 hours worth of gameplay.
8268979	8275158	So I'm sure those of you that are fans of the Ace Attorney series will be happy about that, although the game is going in a little bit of a different direction this time.
8275840	8276602	Hopefully not for the bad.
8278069	8289676	Well, speaking of bad as in badass, Raven Software is actually wanting to make a particular game since they've been, and of course they were the ones that made the X-Men Origins Wolverine game.
8289977	8291077	They want to do a Deadpool game.
8292018	8293839	They really want to do a Deadpool game, it says.
8294760	8306087	And actually, their project lead for the Wolverine game, Dan Vondrak, said that they really want to do it because of Deadpool's smartass attitude.
8306667	8308808	And if they made one, I will buy it.
8309828	8311088	On every platform.
8311248	8311808	Just watch.
8312068	8314009	Just on principle alone, even though it might suck?
8314909	8320851	Well, if the X-Men Origins game was pretty good, then I would expect them to give the Deadpool game a good treatment.
8320891	8324152	So, hey, I'm feeling good about that.
8324632	8329393	Now, do we have any word yet on whether you will be able to break the fourth wall in this game?
8329433	8330013	You have to.
8330413	8332334	It won't be a Deadpool game if you don't break the fourth wall.
8334141	8335973	There should be a button to smash the fourth wall.
8335994	8337443	He should know he's in a video game.
8339247	8341209	So it's going to be like Eat Lead?
8341930	8342390	Perhaps.
8342590	8342971	I don't know.
8343992	8345973	That's the big thing about Deadpool.
8346114	8346854	I did not know this.
8347175	8353040	I actually read up on Deadpool after seeing the Wolverine movie to figure out why Jamie was so obsessed with Deadpool.
8353421	8354061	I get it now.
8354582	8356503	It sounds like a very Jamie thing from what I read.
8356543	8359787	I'm going to have to just send you some images that you'll know.
8359987	8361468	You saw the little yellow boxes?
8362469	8364251	That's like ultimate right there.
8365071	8369795	But by the way, the article that I'm reading actually did compare what they imagine as being like Eat Lead.
8371276	8371496	Nice.
8372357	8373298	Alright, well guess what?
8373338	8375940	It's that time of the show where we're going to take your phone calls.
8376040	8377201	The phones are already ringing.
8377241	8381184	A 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8381224	8382205	So let's go to the phones.
8382265	8383245	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8383265	8383606	Who's this?
8384386	8386047	Hey, it's been a while since I've been on here.
8386268	8387188	It has been a little while.
8387268	8387689	Who is this?
8388325	8390446	Hey, it's DJ Ranma S from New York.
8390746	8394487	Now see, I knew that, but I always make people introduce themselves for the sake of new listeners.
8394887	8396708	Well, what's on your mind, DJ Ranma S from New York?
8397328	8397828	Not too much.
8397888	8401650	I have a couple questions, but first, Loki, congratulations.
8403170	8403530	Thank you.
8404270	8404851	You're welcome.
8405251	8410593	You weren't able to get through last week when, of course, it was announced that Loki's looking at twins in the future.
8410833	8411193	Fun, fun.
8412373	8412773	Yeah.
8413313	8413714	So what's up?
8415594	8417775	My only qualm was about
8418188	8420749	Konami cancelling Six Days in Fallujah.
8421349	8422790	That's my only beef.
8423810	8424751	What's your problem with it?
8425991	8427152	This is the way I look at it.
8427412	8438737	If it's okay to have various World War II simulating fighting games, I don't see how that's any different from Six Days in Fallujah or that's any different from the America's Army game.
8439198	8442481	I mean, they're all more or less based on real-time events.
8442661	8443702	But it's too soon.
8444123	8445304	People we know died there.
8445364	8446105	It's too soon.
8446725	8447626	It's too soon for this.
8448127	8449308	The wounds are too fresh.
8449888	8452411	I applied the Dennis Leary quote to this.
8453172	8453912	Shut the fuck up!
8454393	8455414	By Dr. Dennis Leary.
8456693	8457093	I agree.
8457153	8458334	I'm just being devil's advocate here.
8458354	8461416	I don't say I necessarily believe this, but what do you say to those people?
8461737	8462997	Besides shut the fuck up.
8463198	8469462	You can't say that to somebody who's, I guess maybe you can, but it's not a very nice thing to say.
8469482	8471023	I mean, is there anything else to say besides?
8471763	8472124	Let me ask this.
8472224	8473505	Why should they shut the fuck up?
8475326	8477167	Me personally, I'm just tired of hearing about it.
8477307	8482030	I mean, you've got people who are over there fighting who are actually all for the game.
8482050	8484092	They want their experiences in it, you know?
8484693	8489695	They're over there doing what they have to do for us to do what we have to do here.
8491756	8493296	I feel that this is their game.
8493456	8494697	They earned this.
8495097	8495857	Let them have it.
8496497	8498958	If people don't want to see it, then they just don't have to buy it.
8500219	8500759	Exactly.
8501479	8507061	Isn't it interesting that Konami might take more flack over not releasing this game than they would have if they had released it?
8509682	8511783	One way or another, it'll be released, you know.
8512242	8515724	If not, someone's going to release a beta for everyone to go play, you know.
8517865	8518705	Yeah, I guess that's true.
8518765	8520786	I mean, it'll leak.
8521066	8521806	It'll get pirated.
8522326	8523387	Isn't that the inevitable?
8524485	8525285	That's always the case.
8526226	8527786	Well, anything else on your mind tonight, Ranma?
8528787	8529187	Not too much.
8529227	8532788	I'm just glad that you guys got all the parts for the new studio PC.
8533348	8534069	They're all here.
8534169	8535389	Sadly, we haven't put it together yet.
8535409	8536710	It's just the timing hasn't worked out.
8536790	8540971	But Loki's going to do it during our break next week.
8541151	8543572	So that when we come back, we'll be on an all-new computer.
8543632	8547734	So maybe we'll try to find some other new things to show off next week after a little break.
8548594	8550135	Which we've been taking a lot of breaks this year.
8550175	8550715	I feel bad.
8550775	8551375	But you know what?
8552756	8553136	It happens.
8553823	8555025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8571987	8601227	um it's a possibility for later this year I really want to get back there but it's just because I promised ASEN I would do that sometime I'm doing that this year and that's going to be a chunk of money um and then you know I still really want to do PAX and E3 that's just going to set me back financially um I still really want to try and do New York in the fourth quarter and if things continue to go well for me in my day job and everything and I don't have any worries about the economy or anything like that um I'm hoping to do New York in the fourth quarter of the year like maybe October again
8602025	8602966	That would be awesome.
8603546	8608751	And on behalf of the New York Oil Army, we have one request if you make it out this way.
8609972	8611513	Pack Jamie in the suitcase with you.
8612717	8613577	I'll do what I can.
8614537	8629641	If I had the money for it, I would be happy to, but as it is, I've had to already call off one trip that I was going to make at the end of this month, and having to put in extra massage time just to save up for a trip in two months, so I'm broke.
8630061	8630741	I'm flat broke.
8630821	8631882	School is wiping me out.
8632062	8633282	I know what I feel.
8633382	8633962	I should say this.
8634002	8641424	Sadly, DarkSakura is not going to be doing E3 with us, which is unfortunate, but real life, greater than radio show, so...
8642264	8643545	Yeah, just trust me.
8643686	8646268	I really wanted to come back out there this year.
8646308	8647348	Yeah, I really wanted to.
8648129	8649850	Well, we'll make it work somehow.
8649930	8657756	Then we'll have, you know, the economy set us back a little bit, but, you know, hopefully things will start to pick up and then 2010 we'll have lots of visits.
8657776	8659378	You come here, I'll go there, we'll have a lot of fun.
8660418	8662060	Sort of like an exchange program.
8662180	8666143	And I'll give in and I might even go to Atlanta for Bobby and go to a Friday Night Gaming show.
8667064	8669385	Well, I will be down in Atlanta this year, so.
8669525	8670206	Will you really?
8670306	8671427	For what, a convention or something?
8672188	8675611	Yeah, my company, we may be doing DragonCon this year.
8676852	8677593	Oh, nice.
8677693	8682457	Well, if you're going to be there for DragonCon, I doubt Bobby's going to be there with his Friday Night Gaming shindig.
8682497	8685860	But if you happen to be there on a weekend and he's doing that, you should go say hi.
8685880	8689363	I know he likes to see the visitors out there.
8689683	8692045	I'm sorry, the name of the town escapes me that they tape in.
8694067	8694627	Oh, I'm bad.
8695308	8695528	What?
8695848	8699151	The name of the town that Bobby tapes Friday Night Gaming in is not Atlanta.
8699171	8699931	It's one of the suburbs.
8699951	8700252	Alberta?
8700728	8700968	Marietta?
8700988	8701168	Marietta?
8730772	8759215	and actually our internet went down in studio that's why we lost DJ Ranma is anybody online doing nobody's doing anything okay well right now it is trying to reconnect right now we went down um oh there we go woo Roswell is the town that they tape in I'm still on there we go fine I'm sorry I got it back but the the stream is down right now unfortunately so can we post that in chat that the stream is down but Skype is still open hold on all right
8762185	8766788	So yeah, we unfortunately have that outage right now, but that's what happens sometimes with live radio.
8766848	8767469	Things go down.
8767669	8768029	Okay, good.
8768109	8768609	Streams back up.
8768629	8768890	Hooray.
8769490	8769750	Alright.
8771251	8773673	1877 GameOLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8773713	8774233	Give us a call.
8774273	8775234	We'll take some calls.
8777516	8779197	If you can't get through, keep trying.
8779957	8785081	That little spurt of downtime we might have just had could have affected the calls.
8785841	8786081	Okay.
8786402	8787282	I think we're getting calls again.
8787322	8788543	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8788563	8788923	Who's this?
8790524	8791005	This is
8794106	8795386	Hi, you're breaking up there a little bit.
8795426	8795866	Who is this?
8797767	8798607	Spazinator.
8799108	8799728	Hi, Spazinator.
8799748	8800268	What's on your mind?
8802389	8809572	Yeah, well, I did this earlier, but apparently I sent the email a little bit too late.
8809592	8816094	More or less, I'm going to repeat a couple of questions.
8816214	8822497	They're more or less directed towards you because you got your
8823263	8833186	I just want to point out, the connection's still really bad, but go ahead and ask your questions and we'll try to answer them.
8833526	8836287	But I don't know if we can stay on, but keep going with your questions.
8838228	8844870	Yeah, basically, what's your overall impression of PlayStation 3 this season?
8848004	8849548	Overall impression of the PlayStation 3.
8850430	8852656	It's very similar to how I feel about the PSP.
8852716	8853498	The PSP
8856260	8857601	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8878473	8905009	you know the internet browsing on it is better than it is on the Wii it has some cool little built in things for the CD music so it's kind of like it's not my favorite of the gaming systems I think my Xbox 360 is my favorite gaming system but I love the fact that it's quiet and I think that it's kind of I don't think it's a bad system at all I just wish they'd get some better exclusives but they do have some games I love like Little Big Planet and
8905968	8929024	Also, in terms of the multi-platform games out there, do you ever have a difficult time trying to pick and choose which system you're going to get the game for, especially if there's no real difference between, let's say, the 360 version and the PlayStation 3 version?
8929044	8929584	Absolutely.
8929924	8931525	I have been in that situation before.
8931805	8942571	Street Fighter 4 was the last time I had to make that decision because I pretty much swore up and down to myself I was going to get Street Fighter 4 on PlayStation 3 because PlayStation 3 had the better controller and I knew I'd be able to pull off the moves easier on the controller.
8943092	8944793	Damn, I wish Microsoft would fix that.
8944833	8952457	As opposed to doing all this motion controller BS that they're starting, I really wish they would just fix the controller they've got and make that D-pad easier.
8952517	8958821	But anyhow, I ended up getting it on the 360 because I thought Microsoft can fix their controller later on
8959381	8962243	and just more people are on the 360 playing it.
8962303	8967425	I can go on Xbox Live and there's way more people playing it whereas on my PlayStation 3 friends list there's not nearly as many people.
8967585	8976430	Yeah, completely unrelated topic.
8976450	8982313	I finally found something that's far, far worse than being rickrolled.
8982333	8983714	Uh-oh, what's that?
8985997	8992642	It's kind of similar to be Rick Roll where someone sends you a link just saying it's one thing and it turns out to be something else.
8993123	8995845	As long as it's not that two girls one cup crap.
8997426	9000189	No, actually there is a girl involved.
9001270	9006974	Maybe you're kind of familiar with the story because it apparently occurred out your way.
9007855	9010998	Apparently some girl in California died like
9012209	9019992	on Halloween Day two years ago, and some cop released the accident photos.
9020012	9021472	Someone sent me a...
9040459	9043041	Anyway, Spazinator, we gotta let you go, but thanks so much for the call.
9043441	9044002	Have a good one.
9044182	9044382	Yep.
9044762	9047684	Alright, and if you want to call, give us a call.
9047704	9051587	1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9052107	9056890	What's 1-877-GAME-OLR or your username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9057331	9059892	We'll take a couple more calls here tonight and then we're going to wrap things up.
9059932	9060893	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9060913	9061253	Who's this?
9062554	9063195	DSMaster26.
9063875	9065416	Well, hello, DSMaster26.
9065436	9066157	What's on your mind tonight?
9067938	9069039	Not much other than...
9070174	9077437	Well, the whole Guitar Hero vs. Rock Band debate, it's kind of rambling for me.
9078037	9082519	Because, I mean, what the heck?
9083240	9089783	You know, I've heard my friends at the Hanna Club kind of rumor again and again at some point.
9091463	9099587	They're probably, knowing what, you know, how Konami teamed up with Disney a bunch of times to get, you know, the Disney DDRs and whatever.
9101877	9109461	Are you saying that you're afraid this is going to go the route of the DDRs or that it's not such a bad thing because there's been so many DDRs with the Disney and all that stuff?
9110962	9113063	You know, probably to expand our audience.
9113163	9118686	I mean, I guess it could work, but I mean, the Wii was a family system to begin with.
9119327	9130733	So, and I'm thinking of just springing and getting a 360 anyways if I'm doing Guitar Hero stuff and using it for then and using the Wii for everything else.
9132406	9135147	Yeah, I mean, I could see that being a little bit of a competition fence.
9135167	9136407	I mean, but at the own... I think you're breaking up there.
9136427	9136567	Hello?
9136648	9137008	Hello?
9161974	9165259	Thank you for watching!
9173410	9173990	What can we say?
9174191	9178634	Dude, my internet's been crap all day at home, and I am with Comcast.
9179294	9184318	We have been having issues here in the area, like when the rain started and all that stuff, so I don't know what the hell's going on.
9184919	9186200	So I apologize to folks.
9186240	9187561	Well, let's try to get one more call.
9187621	9188521	If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
9188541	9191924	1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9191964	9192665	Go ahead and give us a call.
9192685	9196648	See, the chat room stopped again, and I'm wondering if that means do we crap out on... No?
9197048	9197928	We're still broadcasting.
9200070	9203412	Just to be on the safe side, since we're toward the end, I closed all my browsers.
9206333	9211656	I think I pinged out a chat, so I don't think... Yeah, I'm not... So we can't see it.
9211756	9213737	No, and the stream went down on top of all that.
9213817	9216819	Boy, what a fun time we're having tonight.
9218800	9220461	Everybody sure they're not downloading anything?
9220501	9221061	Is my roommate...
9221894	9222535	DarkSakura, I like pie
9243329	9270394	Ultima Online is actually bringing out a new expansion, the Styganian Abyss, I guess, and apparently it will allow you to play as a new class, the Gargoyle class, and you'll also be able to explore the new Gargoyle home of Termur and the Styganian Abyss, I guess, dungeon, which is the largest dungeon area ever introduced into Ultima Online.
9271598	9272198	That's pretty cool.
9272739	9276301	I can't believe that Ultima Online is still alive and kicking after all these years.
9277001	9278342	That's pretty impressive in itself.
9278903	9279163	Yes.
9279403	9279843	Oh, yes.
9280043	9280324	All right.
9280924	9282185	Well, hello, caller.
9282205	9283025	You're on the air.
9283566	9284927	You're supposed to wait for me to acknowledge you.
9285747	9286327	Hi, Zaku.
9286368	9289029	What's on your mind, buddy, while we're having crappy internet problems tonight?
9290050	9290650	Nothing much.
9290730	9297815	Just praying that the street doesn't go down again and just enjoying the fact that me and my bro have the house to ourselves because mom's on vacation in Peru.
9299389	9300470	So what's on your mind?
9300490	9301811	What possessed you to call in tonight?
9301831	9304053	You're just bragging that you have the house all to yourself.
9309478	9309758	Hello?
9310259	9310839	God damn it.
9310939	9311540	Hello, are you there?
9313602	9314162	Caller, are you there?
9316184	9317005	We lost another one.
9318226	9320788	Okay, we're going to turn off Justin TV and hope that that'll help things.
9321469	9322670	So, boy oh boy.
9322690	9326313	I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
9328695	9330095	What a dumpy end to the show.
9330175	9331916	Oh, well, that happens sometimes, guys.
9334217	9339360	If Zaku can get his question out in chat, we'll try to answer it, guys.
9339400	9343762	If you want to get your questions out in chat, we'll try to answer them while Loki gets some last-minute stories out of the way.
9347703	9353144	Mr. T and Will Wright are teaming up against Nazis in a new Zootfly game.
9353525	9358206	Zootfly, if you remember, is the company originally they were pitching the Ghostbusters game.
9359106	9361327	They've also done some other stuff beyond that.
9362307	9364647	But now they're making a Mr. T game.
9364667	9365548	What?
9367108	9368888	Yes, he will take on Nazis.
9369189	9370709	Will you tell people to get nuts?
9370849	9384652	It says apparently the first game will see Mr. T take on Nazis and their gigantic machines in a varied universe of South American rainforests, lost ancient cities, industrial complexes, and contemporary military installations.
9385012	9390714	Along with Mr. T and other characters from the graphic novel, the game will feature none other than Will Wright.
9391547	9409703	In this universe, Will Wright is a top-notch game designer, but also, but a top-notch, I guess he's not a top-notch game designer, but a top-notch American geneticist who was kidnapped and coerced to work on a diabolic plan, and Mr. T and Will Wright will join forces to annihilate the Nazis and their hardware.
9410043	9412385	Who was smoking crack when they thought of this?
9413466	9414327	That's an awesome game.
9414387	9417250	I bet you anything they saw the Snickers commercials with Mr. T.
9417975	9418556	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
9435571	9438552	And yeah, we're just trying to finish up the show at this point.
9438592	9441493	We just turned off Skype because the calls just aren't cooperating tonight.
9442013	9443313	I don't know what's going on, guys.
9443773	9445614	All of our configurations are fine on our end.
9445634	9446814	There's no cable problems.
9446894	9447814	Nothing's falling apart.
9448494	9449595	No video card issues.
9449755	9451235	It's something on the Comcast.
9451455	9458037	And then there was an update to Noby Noby Boy, which apparently added the 4-boy offline multiplayer mix.
9458177	9462178	In addition, there's a new boy that you get to play as, Fart Boy.
9462198	9462658	What?
9463378	9465100	Yes, Fartboy.
9465280	9466501	Is that his given name?
9466581	9468923	That is his given name, Fartboy.
9469284	9471285	As well as, I guess, the lower key updates.
9471426	9478592	They have variations to the boys' house hairstyles and new poses to the game's bird.
9480970	9482832	That's awesome.
9483473	9487056	Then we were talking a little bit about the rumors of the PSP Go.
9487497	9491921	Well, there's a new game coming from Capcom, Fate Unlimited.
9493523	9495866	They're going to put that actually on...
9497659	9499160	It's going to be download-only in Europe.
9499700	9503663	But apparently Capcom is releasing on the UMD elsewhere.
9503883	9510628	So they're kind of testing that whole thing to see if people actually buy the download-content-only games.
9511448	9512008	I don't know.
9512709	9514070	Maybe it is a sign of things to come.
9514390	9517192	What do you think is going to happen if the answer is no, they don't?
9518601	9522224	and they've invested all this in this PSP Go thing.
9522584	9529889	Well, I heard the rumor about the PSP Go is that the design is not finalized yet and so they could add the UMD drive if necessary.
9530209	9532091	I think it would be a good idea if they were...
9533100	9533701	Marvel vs. Capcom 2
9549838	9577767	and then also they had a PS3 demo that came out this week actually so if you want to check that out you can and of course that was that countdown that they had going they're going to have apparently all 56 characters will be unlocked from the beginning and they're going to also feature I guess some HD upscaling as well as widescreen options and custom soundtracks on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 and
9578987	9583031	and they also have three different screen modes that you can do.
9583051	9591438	You can do just the classic, you know, kind of pixelated look and then they have a smooth and a crisp look that you can do.
9594888	9610897	And finally, I just want to say for the live listeners, while the stream is up, I have double-checked everything in the house, including what's going on with my roommate and everything, and we don't know what's going on with the stream right now, so we're just going to try and limp our way through the end of the show at this point.
9611297	9611837	We're almost there.
9612297	9613438	Sorry, guys.
9613798	9619301	There's been a picture of the homebrew enabler on the PSP-3000 working, so...
9620962	9624424	It's only a matter of time before the custom firmware is on the PSP 3000.
9626145	9627085	That's interesting.
9627845	9632328	Finally, we were talking a little bit about Wolverine Origins, the video game.
9632348	9645154	Apparently, since Activision is fun like that and Blizzard likes doing all sorts of crazy stuff, they've hidden a lot of little Easter eggs in the game, including references to Portal.
9645414	9648936	They have a surprise cake that you can get that unlocks an achievement.
9649503	9658847	and also they even have the Frostmour from World of Warcraft as well in there that you can get an achievement that's entitled Wow.
9661208	9661568	Wow.
9663508	9663889	Amazing.
9664029	9665369	So lots of little hidden goodies.
9666450	9670451	Alright, well we're going to go around and wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts.
9671091	9672612	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
9674273	9677934	I want animal style fries and a milkshake.
9679801	9683390	My final thought is I hate internet problems that you can't explain.
9684434	9686415	Thank you for watching!
9714073	9714373	That's it.
9715993	9716313	Alright.
9716994	9725595	Well, thank you guys so much for tuning into our show and downloading and especially the live listeners who stuck with us through the ups and downs of the connections tonight.
9726095	9726916	Don't know what's going on.
9726936	9728276	The internet's crazy like that sometimes.
9728616	9733497	But thank you guys for staying with us, especially those of you on the podcast for downloading and supporting Independent Radio.
9733537	9734317	We really appreciate it.
9734697	9741939	We will be back in two weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio with more and so we'll see you back here on May 17th with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
9741959	9742719	Thank you guys so much.
9742779	9743099	Take care.
9743179	9743659	Have a great week.
9744830	9747532	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio
