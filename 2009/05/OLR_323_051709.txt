The studio behind Duke Nukem Forever closes, details are revealed on Guitar Hero 5, and could a popular import fighting game be US bound?
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
What are you doing in my house?
DarkSakura.com
Anyway, I won't bore you with the details, but I will bore you with the one and only Techmaster Loki!
Hello.
How are you doing, Loki?
Could be better.
Oh, really?
I'm sitting on a sep stool.
It's hard as a rock.
We'll figure it out.
Maybe at the halfway point we can switch.
We can get you a chair for next week.
We'll figure something out.
We'll work it out.
Anyhow, we're back, and of course we have a little time to catch up on, so we'll play a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?
Because that's how we always start things off.
So How Was Your Gaming Week?
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
Well, I played Sims.
Sims 2, that's about it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So, just to see how it worked.
And now I'm curious.
Okay.
We'll leave it at that then, I suppose.
Are you excited for Sims 3?
Kind of.
I was looking on the Twitter earlier and looking at the friends list on the Twitter.
And apparently some of our listeners are pretty excited because I guess Sims 3 just leaked out.
So, some folks are already downloading that and having fun with it.
Really?
Uh-oh.
No, not during the show.
Yeah, not during the show.
Leave it to Loki in five minutes to try and pirate something from the new location.
Jeez.
and Cher.
I'm not surprised though.
Although I am surprised it's so early.
A lot of EA leaks this week.
But of course, Loki will buy the game if he enjoys it.
Of course I will.
No, I probably won't enjoy it though.
Just like I enjoyed Spore.
I found the case for that today with the DVD inside.
I'm like, oh yeah, I have Spore.
More like Boar.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Bitch in the half to flash.
The setup I had didn't want to work with it correctly, and so it was able to grab the key and that kind of stuff, but I had to actually take my broken 360 and take that drive and spoof it as the one.
Anyways, so basically I have four modded systems now, and the whole reason we have four modded systems is because we're playing four modded copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 in our company deathmatch that we do.
and it's all sorts of fun right now we're testing out some of the new weapons that I'm building for it one of them is kind of like I'm calling it the hurricane bomb and basically what it does is you fire it and it creates a giant physics force that will toss people around um
No damage, but it will throw people and you can throw them into walls and stuff and that causes damage.
So we've been playing with that and it's absolutely distracting.
You know what kind of weapon you need to make?
And maybe I just have Star Trek on the brain because that movie was so fucking epic.
You need a red matter weapon.
That's what you need.
I tried making something similar.
How could you program a singularity in a game?
Something to create a black hole.
Something to make the game suck!
There's nothing to create, unfortunately, a negative physics force.
You can sort of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
so that's just fun you know basically you know play against each other and really the only thing only reason I need the mod all four systems because if you put one of the weapons on the way it calculates damage and physics and stuff like that you actually have to have all the systems modded the same with the same kind of you know edits to the game in order for it to work correctly because otherwise it just doesn't work but yeah it's been a lot of fun and hopefully I'm trying to
Get some more stuff added into that.
So, aside from playing Grand Theft Auto 4 PC and Lost and Damned on the 360, I've also been playing Rock Band Unplugged because that somehow leaked online.
And so, you know, I had to check it out.
Honestly, I'm glad I checked it out this way because I can't see myself purchasing this game.
I think I get bored of it really fast.
Really?
Why?
Because I get bored of Rock Band pretty fast.
It's just not the same as playing Rock Band.
I mean, it's frequency amplitude, so at least that way they can kind of add music that would normally not be in Rock Band.
It doesn't have to necessarily be rock music.
They can do electronica and all that sort of stuff.
But...
I don't know.
I spent more time customizing my characters than I did actually playing the game.
And it's alright.
It's what it is, I guess.
But I don't know.
It's just alright.
I don't think I'd buy it, though.
How does it compare to Frequency and Amplitude and all those games we think this game was inspired by?
Um, honestly, I've never really, I haven't played too much of frequency or amplitude, but from the little that I have played, it's pretty much the same type of thing.
Um, you know, except kind of the rock band setup, whereas you have the same sort of graphics that you'd see in rock band, except you're jumping between three, you know, four different tracks.
And you are switching a lot through there, and that's kind of where I mess up usually in the songs, because the songs themselves aren't that hard.
Obviously, I'm not playing on, like, expert difficulty or anything like that, but I'm just playing on normal difficulty that's in the game.
It's not that hard, but it's just, you know, jumping back and forth between tracks, you know, I miss usually the first note or something like that because I'm like, oh, crap, oh, it doesn't want me to jump here, it wants me to jump here.
And it's like, uh, it's kind of annoying.
But, um, I don't know, it's alright, I guess.
I mean, there's no real good music games on the PSP other than, like, TJ Maxx.
So, you know, more the merrier, I guess.
I still kind of want to buy it.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Okay, so my gaming week.
Before I get to my gaming week, since I did kind of invoke Star Trek, I just have to say, oh my god, was that not like the greatest thing ever?
Like, that movie was so awesome.
And like, I know there's probably some people out there that don't really want to hear it because like, you know, every movie has its detractors.
But I got to tell you, you don't have to be a Trekkie to appreciate Star Trek.
That was the goal, I think.
I did think, though, that his Spock was pretty...
Hardcore Did you recognize him?
He played Cupid in Xena
Oh, okay, okay.
Nah, I haven't seen Xena in so long.
But it made me more excited for the Star Trek MMO.
I know!
I'm hoping this invigorates a whole new life into Star Trek.
Like, I hope we get a new show.
Like, I don't think we'll get a show out of this movie.
Like, you know, the actors in this are too big, I think, to want to do a TV show every week.
In fact, one of them's already doing a TV show every week.
But I'm hoping...
He may not be doing that TV show much longer.
True, he might be suddenly available.
But I'm hoping that at least we'll get a new, maybe something in the next generation canon.
Something after that.
I just don't want another prequel.
I'd like to see something later.
Well, this isn't a prequel.
I don't want to spoilery, but you know what I mean.
I know, I know.
I think there's enough out there now that you can say it's a franchise reboot.
Yeah.
That's for sure.
That's for sure.
It's very interesting.
They're talking about that possibly in the sequel, they're going to do Khan again, which would be very interesting.
They could do Khan the first time around.
But we have no Montalban.
I know.
It'd be weird.
We have no rich Corinthian leather.
Anyhow, sorry.
I didn't mean to derail the show.
But you know what?
This Star Trek movie being so good makes me excited for the game that's coming out in a little while.
I haven't played the Xbox Live Arcade game that's out there, but the MMO I'm talking about.
It makes me all excited for Star Trek.
You're not making us a race.
Huh?
I'm making us an official race.
The Olarians?
The Olarians?
That'd be awesome.
And of course my other character's going to be an Orion side girl, so why not?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But they had a little game room set up, and I got to play some of the arcade games they had in there, such as Beatmania 2DX Gold, I believe it was, was in there, which was cool, because I hadn't played 2DX in a couple months, even though we have one here in town, I just never seemed to check out there.
And then I also played Guitar Freaks, which is interesting, because I haven't played Guitar Freaks in a very long time.
Like, the last time I remember actually playing Guitar Freaks was probably...
Not long after I originally bought Guitar Hero on the Xbox.
So it's been like a long time.
And it's kind of interesting that can your Guitar Hero and Rock Band skill help you improve in Guitar Freaks?
Yes, a little bit, except the timing is much different.
And Guitar Freaks, I'm sorry, is still not as great of a game.
It needs a reboot.
It needs J.J.
Abrams to come fix it, is what Guitar Freaks needs.
Rock Revolution, not so much.
I don't know if that series is dead or what, but it was fun to revisit.
I mean, it does have songs.
If you like the J-rock, you're not really going to get a lot of those songs in the games over here.
But yeah, Guitar Freaks, stick a fork in it.
It's pretty much done.
It needs a reboot.
Like most Bomani games right now need a reboot.
J.J.
Abrams needs to go work for Konami and reboot everything over there, I think.
Except for Metal Gear Solid.
That franchise is doing alright still.
He should be directing the Metal Gear Solid movie.
That would be amazing, but you know that guy is going to be in demand now.
So dream on on that one.
Alright, let's see.
What else did I play at the con?
I watched people playing In The Groove 2 and Pump It Up NX and DDR, but there were so many people playing all those games.
I was a little disappointed by their console showing though, especially the first night.
Like half their TVs weren't even on.
And I was like, how did they not have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom at an anime convention?
Of course they had it by Saturday night, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Organized this whole thing amongst a lot of folks that she knew and just what have you.
Kind of like friends of friends.
And there were nine of us in a room.
But what was cool about that is one night we had Street Fighter IV going on the TV in the hotel room, which was a Plasma HD TV.
It was a nice TV because this is the Hyatt.
It was a pretty nice hotel.
So we hooked up two arcade sticks to the TV and just had a ball with it.
It was a lot of fun.
And congrats, by the way, to OL Army member...
Rob D for winning the Street Fighter 4 tournament at ASEN.
Very nice work.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, you have housekeeping tonight.
Yeah, we had... Didn't he also win the TurboGrafx?
He did, and I wasn't able to take that to him, but... Yeah, because I can't find it.
Uh-oh.
Well, no, it's just, I mean, you see how much stuff I have.
I have an idea where it is.
Trust me, as soon as I locate the TurboGrafx, it's yours.
Otherwise, I was saying it's Saturn with no cords.
Yeah, well, maybe we can get that away in a future show.
I think I have spare hookups.
He actually asked me about it, but I was like, oh, she didn't have a chance to see me.
He understood.
He knew you'd been busy, so he knows.
He'll get it.
Pulling my brain out through my ears.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Stuff is just spilling out and we have lots of E3 rumors.
But first, some facts.
And Loki's going to start us off with the cold, hard facts tonight.
In fact, Duke Nukem Forever is still not out, and this isn't helping.
3D Realms, the developer of said game, is actually, or I should say publishing said game, is no longer around.
They've actually shut down and have ceased to operate due to funding issues, and apparently Apogee Software has also laid off all the staff.
That probably doesn't help the game come out any sooner now, when you think about it.
And then, on top of all that, you may not know this, but Take-Two was apparently financing Duke Nukem Forever and had invested approximately $12 million, according to Take-Two.
And according to Scott Miller at 3D Realms, of course, they're saying that they never received any of that money.
and of course the game's not done yet.
So now Take-Two has actually filed a lawsuit against the former 3D Realms members.
and demanding that they get their source code.
Kind of sounds like a whole lot of stuff that was going on with Scratch and DJ Hero.
But hopefully, if they do finally turn over that source code to Take-Two, the game will actually be finished.
And, you know, Take-Two makes some pretty awesome games, so that could be good.
Definitely would come out a lot sooner than, say, ten years.
Or more than ten years.
God, I don't even know how many years it is now.
well sorry to hear it 3D Realms it's been forever this salutes for you
No, but that does suck because it is people's jobs and things.
But this is one of those things that when it was announced, I don't know about you guys, but when I heard the news, I was kind of like, I'm kind of surprised this didn't happen sooner.
And I don't mean to sound insensitive, but in this economy, when we've seen what's been happening to studios left and right, I was kind of surprised that when I heard this news, I was like, oh yeah, how did this studio that had a game that's been in development for like 12 years survive as long as they've had?
You know what I mean?
Thanks for watching!
I don't know.
I swear it's Elvis.
Well, or Tupac.
Loki, in your, you know, expert opinion, I use that term loosely, what do you think?
Do you think we're ever going to see this game, or is it now officially deader than a doornail, we're never going to see it?
Uh, no, I think that we'll see this game, because Take-Two's got money, and they want another franchise that's going to do well, and Duke Nukem, I mean, you think the last Take-Two thing that they, or Take-Two game that published at 3D Realm, what was it, Prey?
It was the last 3D Realm game that they published, uh,
And that did not meet expectations either, if I remember right.
That wasn't very good.
But at the same time, I mean... Actually, for what it's worth, I enjoyed Prey.
Because Prey was a great game for those of us that suck at first-person shooters because of the fact that you couldn't die.
And actually, Prey was kind of epic.
It just felt like Prey ended very abruptly.
That was Prey's biggest detractor.
But everything leading up to that point was actually pretty awesome.
I actually really enjoyed Prey.
Well, they need to still have a good first-person shooter franchise because they don't have one right now.
They have basically your sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Revolver, those two franchises.
They've got their sports games, all the 2K sports stuff, and also if they ever do another table tennis game.
So you've got that, but they don't have a first-person shooter franchise.
They have their kids' lines and stuff like that, like that Nickelodeon, Nick Jr.
stuff.
But they need a good first-person shooter thing, and what better than Duke Nukem?
I mean, I think it'd be awesome if they actually put out a good game.
And that's the problem, is that expectations for it are so high and they want to set this new precedent for interactivity in the game.
Well, that's good, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Let's go to the chat room.
I've been totally ignoring them tonight, and I really apologize.
Chat.OrangeLoungeTrader.com, of course, is always open when we're here.
We're just trying to get used to the new setup tonight, so it's taking me a little longer to get around to them.
However, I wanted to read this because it's something what I'm thinking, too.
UnfoldedRaptor in chat says, I heard about Prey 2, and it sounded awesome, and this news saddens me.
So come to think of it, that just kind of made me think, oh, yeah, this means Prey 2 is definitely deader than a doornail, right?
Because since the first one didn't do that hot... Well, let's say...
the whole deal with them investing money is that they get rights to this kind of stuff because obviously they may sell the rights to somebody else because they're no longer around Actdeft pointed out in the chatroom Max Payne 3 is another game franchise that they have it's a third person shooter if we're going to draw straws here but it's not a first person shooter still a very good action franchise but I don't know I think that they need something like this
You know what Take-Two should do if they're going to inherit all the rights to all these Apogee games and 3D realms?
They should just give us a new Commander Keen game.
How about that?
Since you're going to get all these new licenses and stuff from whatever settlements and stuff, because we know that's what will happen, I think they should just give us a new Commander Keen.
You know what?
Commander Keen versus Jill of the Jungle.
How about that?
DarkSakura?
I was going to make a point earlier about them with Duke Nukem Forever.
The other thing they're going to have going for them to their advantage was 10 years now of coverage press hype.
Thank you for watching!
Well, also you gotta look at, you know, take two.
I mean, what kind of idiots were, you know, running the whole process of them getting this game done?
Because seriously, usually they have, you know, different checkpoints that they have to make before they get funding for this stuff.
I mean, and how could this go on for ten years, you know, and twelve million dollars later?
How could they just let it go?
I mean, there's gotta be some sort of progress being made, and the fact that, you know...
Over 10 years worth of work and nothing's out?
I'm sorry, but even Grand Theft Auto 4 and all these other big blockbuster games only took a few years to put out.
If that, you know, so... Come on, what the hell?
Get a better development team.
Somebody was holding out for perfection and it just never arrived, I guess.
All right, well, moving on, let's go into music game worlds because it's interesting we talk about source codes and legal settlements and so on because there was some interesting development in the whole Scratch versus Activision versus, you know, this whole thing.
And what happened is that this week an LA Superior Court judge ordered that the source code for Scratch the Ultimate DJ must be turned over to Genius and Numark.
These are the two companies that formed the Scratch the Ultimate DJ LLC.
There was actually a company, Limited Liability Corp, formed behind this.
Seven Studios is, of course, now owned by Activision.
They are also going to have to hand over everything they used to make the game.
Scratch LLC says they are going to finish the game, and they will continue their lawsuit against Activision as well.
But the bad news, I'm reading between the lines here, nothing's been said for sure.
But the bad news is, don't expect to see this game until at least next year now.
After all this.
Probably.
Which is too bad.
Because, I mean, at that point, then we're going to have DJ Hero out there as well.
And is it just going to be oversaturation at that point?
Or is there room for two, like there was room for Guitar Hero and Rock Band?
There's room for two.
The only real experience I have with DJ Hero is what I've been reading in Game Informer.
and they do kind of show how the game is going to play which is quite different than how this is going to play because Scratch plays pretty much like Beatmania but now they have a more enhanced scratching system and that kind of stuff and you can do a little bit of improv but when you look at the two games clearly, and I hate to say this, clearly DJ Hero is actually kind of changing the way you play the game and more innovative in that sense
But, I don't know.
I mean, yeah, it does suck.
But at the same time, when we first saw Guitar Hero, most of us looked at it and went, eh, it's just Guitar Freaks, but a little bit different.
I mean, Scratch the Ultimate DJ, we kind of look at it and go, eh, it's Beatmania, but it's like, you know, it's hip-hop instead of techno music.
So, I mean, is that necessarily a bad thing?
Because, you know, those first looks can be deceiving, right?
Because Guitar Hero ended up being a pretty awesome game.
Not necessarily a bad thing, and they might have had a chance if they could get to market first like they were planning on.
If everything had gone as planned, they would be putting this game out in a couple weeks.
But that's not what happened.
So now you've got this monster of a game coming from Activision that's due out in October.
Unless they do some serious miracle working and haul some ass on getting this game done, I don't think it's going to be done before it.
That means we're probably not going to see it at E3 either.
But wouldn't it be interesting if we did?
I'm not going to hold my breath.
They were saying that they were going to have it there, I thought.
But I don't know.
We'll see what happens.
More to develop, I'm sure.
It seems like something new is coming out on this whole thing every week.
And E3 is just going to be kind of the climax of that.
Because you know DJ Hero is going to be there.
So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.
But for now, we move on.
Guitar Hero 5
That would be weird.
So if I wanted to get four singers to sing these songs, I could do that.
They better all freaking be on pitch or I will not listen to them.
Four drummers, too.
I could just have a house full of clacking drums.
That'd be hilarious.
Interesting.
Yes, you could do that.
And great.
There's also another option for party play, meaning that you can come in and out of the songs as you will.
So it's not going to be the, ah, dropping!
It'll be the, oh, they...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and their song challenges and different things I guess they're trying to make it interesting on top of that it will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour and you can actually upgrade the old game to use all the new enhancements in Guitar Hero 5 they're supposed to also have some Johnny Cash
That's the best news of all.
INGN0 in chat asks, could you do four singers, four guitarists, and four drummers?
I don't think all at once.
Any combination of five, I think.
Four, maybe.
Well, maybe five.
I don't know.
I'm sorry, four.
That's right.
Yeah, because there's only four control slots.
I was looking at five.
I think it's any combination of four.
But who knows what's going to be able to be done on the internet?
That would be kind of neat to have band versus band at the same time.
Be interesting.
That's a lot of people, though.
Well, someone did that without a game.
The YouTube band.
I haven't heard of this.
It's a page that has different embedded YouTube videos of people playing chords and different passages in the same key.
Oh, weird.
And you can actually play them all at once or at different times, and they're all harmonious.
It's really cool.
I'll try to find the link again.
Gotcha.
Okay.
But in theory, you could have it.
Okay, could be interesting, could be interesting.
I'm curious to see how this plays out, but I bet you, this is just gonna, you know, all the YouTubes you see out there, speaking of which, of people playing Guitar Hero and stuff, this is just gonna up the craziness of those videos, because now I can just see it.
We're gonna have the four people all singing, you know, Journey or whatever, then we're gonna have just people doing all the mad drumming, four people at once.
You know you're gonna see that expert, everybody in sync, four people playing video.
It's gonna be interesting.
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Cloud9
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
to be pretty decent.
I mean, it's hard to say with no screenshots and no peripherals, but the potential's there.
It's just, if history has taught us anything, I think a lot of us have very low expectations.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
with a very big question mark there.
Who knows?
A lot could happen with this game.
But if you think about it, for those folks that are trying to find a new home, since Konami's not really doing anything with 2DX in the States, maybe this Armin Van Buren game's going to actually be kind of cool.
Do you think we're going to see something like Rock Revolution, but coming out for Beatmania type of thing?
I am actually tempted to say no because of how horrifically Rock Revolution did.
But it depends.
You know, if they put some new creative energy behind it, it's just they're so retarded now.
It's like, what happened?
I mean, I know what happened.
You got rid of all the people that actually had some ideas of where to take the whole Bomani genre.
Instead, you got rid of all of them, and now you have
You're coming out potentially with a, what, collection of older songs?
Like another Best Hits?
Yeah.
Oh, that takes some thought.
Ooh, let's take some old songs.
We don't even have to do shit.
Let's just put it into a new game.
Done.
I'm going to go vacation for the rest of the year.
I don't know.
It is disappointing how the mighty have fallen in terms of creativity and innovation.
But, you know, stranger things have happened.
Let's push some more Frogger games.
That would be perfect.
Because Frogger, that's a franchise that'll never die.
That's gold right there.
Well, speaking of competition, a lot of talk has come up this week about the different turntables between the Scratch game and DJ Hero.
And what's interesting is that if you actually look at the Scratch turntable, the Scratch turntable looks somewhat like a Beatmania controller.
Of course, I hope your left side pried, because that's the direction it looks like it goes.
That does flip.
It does flip.
Oh, that's good.
But it has five keys on it, but they're not staggered like you would see on a Beatmania controller.
They're all in a row.
Kind of looks very much like it looks like someone ripped off a Guitar Hero controller and just kind of laid it next to a turntable.
That's what the scratch turntable looks like.
So don't expect it to look the piano look of Beatmania, if that makes sense.
It's all in a row.
And otherwise, it looks like there's a little kind of crossfader, a little switch at the very, very end as well that's going to be used in the game.
Kind of a bonus thing.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and DarkSakura.
Crossfader Crossfader
Earlier this week, also, they had a partial picture of... Can I say, though, before you move on to DJ Hero, I just want to remind folks, we talked about the song list of this game a long time ago when Loki had a cutting-edge first look at the game before a lot of people did.
I just want to remind everybody, Milkshake by Khalees is in this game.
It needs to come out.
That's all.
That's all.
Now, the picture that went out on the internet is obviously only half of what actually the controller is.
If you had gotten your latest copy of Game Informer magazine, they actually did a six-page write-up on it.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Guitar Hero
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The three tracks themselves have other variations that are going to be coming down.
For example, the green on the far left, you'll see that the line that follows the track is going to shift back left and right.
That's where you're going to be doing the crossfading.
That's your cue to move the crossfader.
Kind of like if you've ever played it, Crackin' DJ.
Very similar to that.
and then also they've got in the center is going to cue or give you the cue when you can do the different sound effects and change your actual effector dial.
And then finally the far right, the blue is going to also have your cues for scratching.
And I think that might also be able to go on the different tracks all together.
I'm not sure if it's just limited to those.
But basically you have to hold down those keys while you're doing the scratching, crossfading and stuff.
So it's
A different style of gameplay than, like, say, Guitar Hero Game or Beatvania, but it's going to have that kind of same effect.
And then, also, all the tracks in the game are all basically mashups.
You know, some of the examples they had in here.
Gorillaz Feel Good Inc.
versus Marvin Gaye.
I heard it through the grapevine.
What? !
Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, Bustin' Loose vs. The Zombies, Time of the Season, DJ Shadow Mix David Bowie, Let's Dance vs. KRS-One, Jack of Spades, DJ Shadow Mix Nirvana, All Apologies vs. Rick James, Give It To Me Baby, DJ Shadow Mix
What the hell?
This sounds crazy.
Tears for Fears, Shout vs. Air Parades, Psyanjo, or Psyano.
Wow.
No, I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, this is a new single.
Yeah.
Huh.
And then other artists, they've got BC Boyz Back, Blondie, and Billy Squire are some other confirmed artists in there as well.
But yeah, the game itself, and actually, I take that back.
It looks like the scratching cues are on all three tracks.
But basically, you're going to have two sets of cues that you're looking for, button presses, and then the actions with the crossfader and stuff.
Just seeing how they're going to do this, I'm actually more excited now about DJ Hero than I was Scratch.
Because Scratch is basically kind of a fancy Beatmania, but this looks a lot different.
And it's going to be interesting to see what you're going to be able to do.
Also, they've got two-player mode in this where you can do the guitars in some of the songs.
And you're also going to be able to hook up a microphone to it if you want to MC over everything.
Wow, that sounds interesting.
Yeah, so very cool stuff.
They got the right idea with this stuff.
Let's see if we can get this.
Very interesting.
Are you trying to get Shermie to meow on mic for us?
Oh, her purr?
I don't know if the purr will pick up.
That mic's probably not sensitive enough.
No, it's not coming through.
No.
It's not registering.
Definitely, definitely, I'd say if anything, go to your bookstore, Barnes & Noble or whatever.
Just pick up a copy of the new Game of Thrones magazine or just browse through it and at least check out the section that they have on DJ Hero.
It's actually very interesting seeing as they haven't shown anything really yet for it.
I'm sure we're going to see a lot more out of E3
And I think it's going to be really fun to check out.
And yeah, it is another thing you've got to buy, another instrument.
But looking at this, though, I don't see how they're really going to add anything to this beyond just the turntable and really...
You can't play this game two player with two turntables yet.
Maybe that's for the next game.
Maybe for the next game.
But right now it's just one turntable.
By the way, the chat is saying I'm on crack and that they could hear the purr.
So there you go.
Shermie did make a cameo on the show.
Although no lights came on on the mixing board.
Yeah, I saw the move.
Oh, maybe that knob is in the way.
I can't see it very well.
Anyway.
He said knob.
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with a trip to the UK?
Well, we have a few things.
The 19th Warrior Epic for PC, and then a bunch of stuff for the 22nd.
Big Family Games on Wii, Terminator Salvation for PC, UFC 2009 Undisputed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Bionic Commando for the same two, Pokemon Platinum for DS, and Steel Princess.
Is this a typo?
I found a typo.
Why?
Is Steel Princess supposed to be as in the act of theft or as in metal?
As in the act of theft.
Okay, never mind that it's not a typo.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be funny.
Like that.
Is that like kidnapping the princess or what happens there?
No, I think the princess is a thief.
Oh, okay.
Sort of like Zelda?
I'm going to find out.
Maybe.
Maybe.
That was chic.
Well, you know what I mean.
Same thing.
Oops, spoiler.
Oops.
Oh no, I did not know that.
Because I've never played Smash Brothers before.
Interesting looking puzzle platformer.
And you can have a map maker.
It looks cute.
Alright, let's move on.
Traveling the world.
How about the US?
US.
We've got actually quite a bit of stuff coming out this week.
On PC, Hinterland Orc Lords.
Never heard of that, but...
Puzzle Kingdoms on the Wii.
That's a rip-off of Puzzle Quest, but it's done by the same developer, so they're ripping off themselves.
So they're ripping off themselves.
Well, that's okay, right?
Yeah, that's alright.
Bionic Commando on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
No word on PC.
I can't remember if that's coming out at the same time.
Punch-Out this week.
Big game on the Wii.
That'll be fun.
If you're into some movie games, Terminator Salvation.
Is it?
I don't know, I'm a little skeptical about Punch-Out!!
I'm sorry, I'm derailing the train, but Loki, is it?
Do you really think it's going to be great, or do you think it's going to be a little cheesy?
I think it's going to be about as good as the first Punch-Out!!
But I love the first Punch-Out!!
Exactly, and basically they brought all the graphics up to date, and they gave you the first Punch-Out!!
again, with some other bells and whistles.
Alright, we'll see, we'll see.
I'm a little skeptical.
I want to demo it before I buy it, that's for sure.
Terminator Salvation coming out on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
Also done by the same developers as Bionic Commando.
Boom Blox, Bash Party coming out on the Wii.
Kind of a reissue there with extra puzzles.
Tournament Pool coming out on the Wii, your generic billiards game.
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Stardust Accelerator World Championship 2009.
Here's what Konami's working on.
More Yu-Gi-Oh!
games.
EA Sports Active.
Hey, they sell...
brand new fitness game from EA hoping to capitalize on the whole wheat fit craze although this does have like an elastic resistance band with it so you can actually do some pretty good exercises with it thinking about getting it but probably won't use it Jagged Alliance for the DS and talking about an old game ported over
Rock Band, Classic Rock Track Pack coming out on all four systems UFC 2009 Undisputed coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360
Space Camp, coming out on DS and on the Wii.
Like the 80s movie?
No, not based off the 80s movie.
Damn it, why can't it be?
I know, that would be an awesome game.
Just another party game from Activision.
Sorry.
You can pretend, I guess.
Poochie Poochie Virus, coming out on Nintendo DS.
Is that a sexually transmitted disease?
I don't know.
Don't sleep with her.
She's got Poochie Poochie Virus.
It's an STD transmitted by Charo.
Yeah, that's what Charo got on the love boat.
Poochie Poochie Virus.
Xtreme Yu-Gi-Oh!
If you're extremely nerdy.
I don't know.
I can't follow the Yu-Gi-Oh stuff.
Never got into the card games.
Party Pigs Farmyard Games.
Yes, it's a barnyard themed sports game from Destiny who puts out all sorts of crap.
And it will give you swine flu.
It probably will.
This is awesome.
The DS.
I Love Beauty.
How about a game called Excuse My Beauty?
That's the game I want to see.
Excuse My Beauty?
Excuse My Beauty, officer.
I'll go over to Arizona, I swear.
If you haven't seen that YouTube, after you're done listening to the show tonight, please go to YouTube, do yourself a favor and look up Excuse My Beauty.
It's the funniest cops you'll ever see.
And coming along with that, Imagine Makeup Artist.
Awesome.
And that's, of course, on the DS.
Because, of course, you need beauty to be excused.
Exactly.
This is the best
And then we've got some other cool stuff.
The Munchables, which is coming out on the Wii.
This is the game that's from Namco that's sort of like Katamari.
Because there's a lot of games sort of like Katamari.
But you basically are an alien that's eating these food-themed alien invaders.
And as you eat more of them, you get bigger and you can eat bigger creatures and so on and so forth.
This is kind of neat.
And...
Let's see here.
Finally... Oh, actually, that's it.
Great.
Let's move on to Japan now and talk about the Japanese release dates, where I mispronounced the release names horribly.
Yay!
Actually, this one will be easy, though.
Mass Effect.
I can pronounce that.
That comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.
That will be the localized version of Mass Effect, which of course came out here quite a while ago, but they've taken some time to make it special for the Japanese, and that will finally be making its way out this week.
If you're a PlayStation 3 owner, not a lot for you, except UFC 2009 Undisputed will make its way to Asian regions, at least, as does Bionic Commando, but not technically a Japanese release.
You don't get anything on the PlayStation 3 in Japan locally until next week.
But on the Nintendo Wii, you have Tact of Magic is a game you have to look forward to.
It is coming out from Nintendo themselves, is the game.
It is looking to be some type of RPG.
Something else.
It doesn't look like it's based off an anime or anything.
I'm not sure if that's something else here.
Does that look familiar to you, Loki?
The artwork does not look familiar.
I don't know if it's a new IP or what.
But that is coming out on the Wii from Nintendo.
Tact of Magic.
But it may not be an anime.
Right now doesn't mean they won't become an anime later on.
Somebody in the chat room may be able to enhance on that.
Nothing on the PlayStation 2 either.
However, the Nintendo DS does see a few releases this week, including Happy Star Band comes out this week, as well as some new cases and things for the DS if that's something you're into.
Another simple DS game, this time series number 48.
Wow.
And then, let's see, also Ora ga Ome o Mamoru comes out this week from Idea Factory, which is an action game.
Something like Protecting Something?
I Will Protect You is the English translation of that game.
Comes out this week.
Lastly, looking at the PSP, it looks to be kind of a slow week.
I don't know if we're getting anything on the PSP this week.
Well, you do get SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.
and Space Invaders Extreme gets a price cut.
So that's some good news on the PSP.
I bet some folks might even import that SNK Classic 1 that has King of Fighters 94, King of Monsters, Metal Slug, Last Resort.
I would hope not since it's already come out.
So, there you go.
Well, there might be at least... We have a couple listeners in Japan.
Maybe they're going to pick that up for their local version.
We'll see.
There you go.
That's what's coming out in Japan.
Let's get back into some gaming news before we get to the end of Part A with the Classic Game of the Week.
But first, some news.
Dark Sakura has some exciting news, right?
Well, um, there is a, uh, issue of Nintendo Power Out that's saying that a particular game that, uh, a lot of people have been importing is going to be coming out in the U.S., and that is Totsunoko vs. Capcom.
Um...
The issue is saying that it is definitely headed out, that Capcom has been attempting to bring it out to North America, but I'm still sort of... I mean, then again, it's Nintendo's official magazine.
Wait, wait, wait.
Nintendo Power?
What's that?
I've never heard of Nintendo Power.
That sounds fake.
Well, maybe people are thinking it's a Photoshop picture, but I mean, this is going to be proven or disproven in a couple days when the issue actually comes out, right?
Yeah, I mean, we'll find out for sure.
In fact, it says it's page 46, so look and see if it's page 46.
I'm looking this over, by the way, just with a very critical eye, and let me see if I can't make this a little bit larger.
What was preventing the game from coming out here in the first place?
Licensing, right?
Because the licensing in America lies with all these different companies.
But if they see the demands there, they're going to let it come out.
Do you think, though, maybe some characters might get cut?
Maybe that's the sacrifice that'll be made.
That would be unfortunate.
Let's hope not.
I don't know.
From looking at this, it doesn't really look very photoshopped to me because of the glare.
The glare on this is far too uniform to be... It's either expertly photoshopped or it's real.
I think it's the real deal, but we need to be prepared for the fact that some of these characters might be cut.
But that could be good news for some people because that means they might get replaced with additional Capcom characters.
Who knows?
I mean, I think we should be prepared to see the character roster possibly shift slightly.
But we'll see, right?
That we will, but I'm honestly putting my money on this being legit.
Good.
Then I don't have to import it.
Hooray.
It's too bad this isn't coming out instead.
What's that?
Someone's Photoshopped Kellogg's vs. Capcom The New Age of Breakfast I've seen that Now that would be a game I'd like to play That would be a lot of fun I would play that That's alright Tony the Tiger would throw down Snap, Crackle, Pop would do like a team attack Anyway, moving on
moving on some other interesting things oh wait wait wait can I say though real quick you said this before the show tonight Loki we were actually talking about this Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and you said maybe this is something Nintendo was trying to keep under wraps and tell E3 to go see core gamers we heart you I'm sure it was but as all things with E3 they never stay under wraps because if you tell somebody they'll tell somebody untrustworthy like us yes
Hey, except we're trustworthy.
Sometimes.
When we want to be, yeah.
When we want to be.
Anyways, Pokemon Gold and Silver are being remade, and that's not a huge surprise.
But, yeah, no time frame, I guess, other than the fact that it's supposed to be in Japan this fall and probably coming out here sometime in the spring, if I remember correctly.
Blast, uh, two games we had it, like, uh, Pokemon, um, Mystery Dungeon, um, Time, and I forget the other one was.
Anyways, those were both, uh, like, around April, so that'd be spring.
I don't know, I,
Pokemon is just not my thing.
It's just really not.
I think I'm out of the age bracket for that.
I'm kind of over it, but I'm a little disappointed it's yet another remake.
I don't know.
I would kind of like to see one of these games on the Wii.
I would like to see one of these games on the Wii, and I understand Pokemon was born as a handheld or what have you, but I don't know.
Or just give us a Pokemon MMO already.
I mean, Pokemon was born to be an MMO.
Couldn't it?
Maybe I'm crazy?
I don't know.
Anyhow, moving on, another game that I guess some were born to play on the Nintendo Wii, Contra.
It's a brand new version of Contra called Contra Rebirth, and if you're in Japan, this game already came out.
It came out on May 12th.
It was released in Japan for $10.
It's awesome.
Have you heard?
I haven't heard.
Tell us a little bit what the game's like.
No, it's awesome.
It's...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
There's a chance.
Just a few more stories for you guys before we get to a little break here tonight.
But first, DarkSakura.
Do we get to break things?
Actually, no, not in my house.
Actually, we're at your house, so yeah, tonight we can.
Let's start with the Dalek up there.
No.
See?
Stop.
That's our new mascot, by the way, is DalekSec.
Because the ferret's at the OLR studios, so...
See?
Anyway.
Oh, God.
Doesn't quite have the charm of the ferret.
Yeah, not quite as charming as the ferret.
I had to.
Kind of annoying.
I kind of wish I could be exterminated for real.
Anyway.
So, new game coming out for the iPhone, which makes me happy because it's one of my favorites, and I have to think about getting it now, is Dig Dug Remix.
It is out for $5.99 on the iTunes App Store, and you have a D-pad and a flick mode.
The flick will let you...
Fling dirt around by flicking your finger on the screen and... What?
I'm just laughing at the concept of kicking dirt around with your finger.
Now with enhanced moving dirt technology.
And you have enhanced shovels so you can dig faster.
And balloon blocks to protect you from falling rocks.
And, hey, it looks pretty fun.
It's definitely got big air pumping power.
So, yay.
The chatroom is commenting on the Dalek being a new mascot.
Brad from PodCulture is suggesting Capcom vs. Dalek vs. Ferret.
And Actdeft adds on to that vs. Clicky.
So somebody needs to hit up Mugen quick.
We'll just dump Shermie on them and they'll all die.
Alright.
Shermie will cute them to death.
He'll purr them to death.
Alright, moving on.
Loki, what do you got for us?
Well, I've got some interesting information.
Of course, right around the corner, we've got BlizzCon.
And earlier this week, tickets went on sale.
And of course, they sell out very fast.
And this is probably not helping slow that down any.
But Blizzard has confirmed that the special pet you will get for attending BlizzCon will be Grunty the Marine Murloc.
Yes, it's Murloc dressed up like one of the Space Marines from StarCraft.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Wow.
And he was trying to get me to go, but he doesn't want me to go to Penny Arcade Expo.
He says I should go to BlizzCon instead.
But dude, Seattle.
And Penny Arcade Expo is kind of awesome.
BlizzCon is too limiting for me.
But if you can't afford to go to BlizzCon and you don't get a ticket, you can, however, for the first time, watch the event on DirecTV or online for $39.99.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If we wanted to be super famous, we'd just talk about Warcraft all the time because that's apparently what makes you popular on the internet.
It just kind of surprised me.
I thought it would be way too saturated for Warcraft podcasts, but they do very well.
Which, by the way, reminds me, be kind.
Rate us a 5 in iTunes.
They have a new rating system now.
Even if you've written a review for the show, you can go back and rate the show 5 stars.
And by the way, thanks so much to those that have already done it.
because we are on page one right now of the podcast that makes us very happy because word of mouth is all we got to spread the word of the show so that's all we ask thank you
So, let's see.
Tora, by the way, in chat is mentioning something about Nintendo Power and the whole Capcom vs. Tatsunoko thing.
Let me read this.
My ex has scans of the Nintendo Power talking about Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.
There's three characters missing from the roster.
Two of them don't have licensing over here in the States.
He's sending them to me now.
Haha.
So that doesn't surprise me at all.
That's kind of what we were saying earlier is that prepare that there might be some roster changes, but they'll try to sell it to you as the same thing.
We'll add more stuff back in.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Okay, anyhow, so BlizzCon, yeah, I don't know.
I think I'm going to pass this year in favor of just reading about it on the internet because $125 for a pet or even $40 for the pet, no thank you.
I mean, WoW's cool and all, but it's not that cool.
Also, what is that cool?
You know who is that cool?
Steve Wiebe.
He is that cool.
And, you know, some companies are willing to pay more than $40 in the name of Steve Wiebe.
In fact, Stride Gum apparently is going to be spending $10,001...
In quarters, that's a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum is their little tagline for Stride gum.
If Steve Wiebe accomplishes the task of taking over the Donkey Kong world record at this year's E3.
So apparently what's going to happen, the reward will be paid if Wiebe does beat Billy Mitchell's record score.
Then apparently Stride is going to provide him with...
A year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum and $10,001 in quarters.
Huh.
So I have the names of the people cut from Tetsunoko vs. Capcom.
Oh, who's that?
Um, was it Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero?
Hmm.
There they are.
Well, you know, again, it was probably a licensing thing, but does this mean maybe Capcom characters will replace them or just, you know, get used to it?
I don't know.
I said Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.
What are you QQing about over there, DarkSakura?
Dude, Joe's awesome.
Alright.
More to come on the whole King of Kong debacle, which still goes on to this day at E3.
But for now, more news.
Ragnarok DS
XSEED is having a matchup with GungHo Works to bring Ragnarok Online DS out in the winter.
So that makes me happy.
Pourings for all, yay!
I just know the first town you have to go is Prontera, just to let you know.
But I love the game, and especially for people who, like me, have been playing RO for, like, ever.
Addict.
I haven't touched the game in a month and a half, Rob.
I haven't touched WoW a lot lately.
You'd be proud of me.
Well, I've just been so busy.
It's not that I don't want to play WoW.
I just kind of had other stuff going on.
I've had way too much to do.
But the whole part of the game, the story of the game, is that you play a guy named Ares who meets this girl.
And she's a job class that does not exist in the game at all.
But she's there, and you have to...
She's lost her memory and you have to help her, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You can change the rest of your job and everything, but it's pretty much RPG with RO flavor.
DeathWishing in chat at chat.orange.radio.com live on this Sunday night is sharing that he could never get into Ragnarok because there was no quest and he likes quest-based MMOs.
So does this DS game kind of add the whole quest element?
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
They're not being quests because there's quests aplenty in RO.
Is that something they added later?
Because it seems like when I was playing years ago, they didn't have them.
Rob, you were playing with me in the beta.
I know, it was years ago.
So they have them now, though.
Yeah, dude, there's even a quest, and it's like a really simple, easy, stupid quest where you get a bajillion experience points just for doing it.
And you've got the ones that give you experience points, the ones questing for items.
Especially the questing for items, that's how you get some of the really rare crap in the game.
I have to admit, there's a tiny, tiny part of me, just very, very tiny, but a tiny, tiny part of me that kind of wants to go back and check out RO.
Play on the server I play on.
But there's also a tiny, tiny part of me that wants to do the same for Final Fantasy XI.
Play on the server I play on.
But I also know my guildies in WoW would kill me in the face if I did something like that, and I don't want to be killed in the face.
Play Ragnarok with me.
It's free.
We'll see.
I don't have time for more crack right now.
I'm a busy boy.
We'll see.
Maybe after E3 when things settle down a little bit.
We'll see.
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we got the Classic Game of the Week coming up.
The Classic Game Flashback is now available on the App Store for your iPhone or iPod Touch.
However, there's something a little interesting about it.
The game itself is $4.99, and it's basically a port of the Amiga version.
However...
apparently Pocket Gamer has done a report on the game and they said that basically you're paying for an emulator and then the ROM is downloaded independently using the emulator I guess and so because of that it's not exactly designed for the iPhone and it's kind of wonky as far as the controls go
Uh-oh, another Mega Man 2.
Yeah, I was going to say, sadly, there's been a couple of those on the iPhone, hasn't there, where there have been emulators.
Not just on the iPhone.
You kind of get the sense that maybe on Xbox Live you get a lot of that, too.
It's just you're basically paying five bucks for an emulator in the ROM.
Well, hell, that is what you're paying for on the Wii, but it's a little different because Nintendo put out the Wii and Nintendo put out all those games.
So, a little different.
Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and it has to do with a really funny guy.
I don't know if you ever watched The Soup, which is a show on E!, but it's awesome.
It's hosted by a guy named Joel McHale, who's pretty funny.
And yes, this does tie into video games, because Joel McHale is apparently going to be giving the Ubisoft press conference this year at E3.
Interesting.
He also was appearing live in LA that same week.
Oh, funny.
On the 6th, or wait...
Oh, bummer.
Bummer, bummer.
Pac-Man!
Well, now that's a classic.
Yeah.
And actually, it was suggested to me by Sauce, so I thought it was actually very, very, very a good one to put in there.
And really, a whole year plus of doing this segment and you've never done Pac-Man.
Amazing.
Nope.
Hey, baby!
Hey, radio, not kitty.
So, anyway, really what I wanted to bring up about this is the Pac-Man franchise, which has gone kablooey.
Also, it is possible to get a perfect game of Pac-Man, but it was only done by the world's biggest asshole, Billy Mitchell.
And, um...
There also was an 8-year-old boy who, in 1982, made it through the split-screen level, which is basically what happens when it basically gets over more than what the memory of the game can handle, because it just basically recalculates every time it goes through.
Um...
So the game was actually made by Namco, brought up by Midway in America.
And it was... The way that the name of the game came around was from a Japanese phrase, Pakupaku Taberu.
Pakupaku is the sound the mouth makes when open and closed right away.
I never knew that.
So...
Basically, and Taberu is to eat.
So basically, the character is supposed to sort of look like pizza, missing a piece.
So as it came out, it...
It went kind of meh in Japan, but when Midway grabbed it over here, it was totally, totally, totally explosive.
It went crazy, and everyone liked it because all they really had before were Space Invaders.
You know, that realm.
Yeah, the music's getting a little monotonous here, so I thought maybe we could switch it up a little bit, and I'll play something else for the Classic Game of the Week here.
Okay.
Well, um...
Well, we can play some of his background music here.
Okay, anyway.
So also, since Pac-Man made it really, you know, really happy over here, that also we're able to bring out a few other games like Rally-X.
And Pac-Man actually even surpassed Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game of all time when it was released.
Um, so basically, we can just say that Pac-Man was, I want to say, the game that really propelled, you know, video games more closer to the mainstream, apart from just being something for kids.
I remember being little and seeing adults playing it.
I remember playing Pac-Man on roller skates.
Yes, Pac-Man on roller skates.
I remember roller skating to this song that's playing in the background right now.
That was hardcore.
Well, also, I have somewhere in the vault, or actually not in the vault, in the garage, a Pac-Man plushie with the little ghost in his mouth wearing a t-shirt and everything that came out in the 80s.
You know, it had Pac-Man glasses.
The glasses that they had at Burger King, or was it?
I had the Pac-Man board game.
I remember that.
And I seem to recall there was Pac-Man cereal, if I'm not mistaking.
And I'm pretty sure I had that too.
Well, I'll tell you something else that this might be interesting.
In Japan, it was actually called Puckman.
And they changed it to Pac-Man because they were afraid that vandals were going to change the P to an F, so it would be Puckman.
That's awesome.
You can still find Puckman.
I'm sure they did in Roms somewhere.
I'm sure.
You can still find Puckman machines in Europe, apparently.
I want a Puckman machine.
Now let's go ahead and talk about sequels, well actually the different ports.
There was the Apple II series, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, the 8-bit computers, IBM, the early IBM PC, Intellivision, Commodore 64, NES.
On handheld we had Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, which I have.
Actually I've got so many versions of this damn game.
Christ, it's only a three hour show, you know.
there were just all the different versions and of course we have them all in the Namco Museum, Xbox Live Arcade we've got the there's the Championship Edition my favorite to this date is the the one on GameCube hi baby sorry it's my cat where you play as the ghost stop trying to get your cat to talk during this segment
And by the way, I love the little flashing thing on this article because the Atari 2600 version SUCKED!
SUCKED!
Sorry.
Super Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, Junior Pac-Man, Pac and Pal, Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp
I think Chum Chum was his dog, wasn't it?
We have Professor Pac-Man, which was an unauthorized one that Midway created.
Pac-Land, which I've actually got on the PC Engine Duo.
By the way, this is for you, DarkSakura.
This is just for you here.
Is it a 7-Up commercial?
No.
Even worse.
Far worse.
That's the Atari 2600 version.
As everybody's ears bleed.
We had Pac-Mania, which is actually a really, really good follow-up game.
Pac-Man VR, Pac-Man Arrangement, which was in the Namco Classic 2.
Ms.
Pac-Man Galaga Class of 81, Pac and Party, Ms.
Pac-Man Galaga Frogger Classic Combo, Pac-Man 25th Anniversary, and then Pinball!
We had Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Also for console, we have Pack Attack, Pac-Man 2, Pac-In-Time, Pac-Man World, Ms.
Pac-Man Maze Madness.
Dude, there's so many different ones.
Pac-Man Carnival this year.
multiple home versions all kinds of stuff so yeah we have had I would have to say that my favorite Pac-Man game in the series overall just as far as fun to play is Super Pac-Man that's why I was just loading up right now I love Super Pac-Man that game is so much fun
And of course there were clones like Funny Man and blah blah blah.
Now this was kind of cool, and I remember reading up on this a while back.
There were a bunch of students that went to Simon Fraser University who did Lifesize Pac-Man who used laptops and mobile phone GPS to track where the dots were and where Pac-Man was.
and it is now played regularly in downtown Vancouver.
There's also another one that's Pac-Man Hatton where Pac-Man is played around Washington Square Park.
And I've actually seen video of that one.
That one's pretty cool.
There is actually, they were going to do a Pac-Man movie in 2004.
Crystal Sky Pictures said they were going to do it and no.
Thank God, because it would have been terrible.
It was supposed to be 200 million dollars.
Um... And as you heard in the background, there was Pac-Man Fever, which was, you know, just put out, you know, for fun, and it actually made it to number 9 on Billboard Hot 100 charts.
Um... Guinness World Records gave Pac-Man 8 records in 2008, including first perfect Pac-Man game for Billy Mitchell.
Asshole.
Most successful coin-operated game, largest Pac-Man game for Pac-Man Hatton.
Um...
It's been a generation-defining game.
Also, Rob, now you have to find this because we have to play this.
There was the Pac-Man 7-Up commercial set to a modified tune like Betty Davis' eyes.
I would be happy to, but Actdeft is going to have a coronary if you don't mention Pac-Man Championship Edition.
I did!
Oh, you must have missed it.
I've said it several times.
Amongst the gazillion other Pac-Man games you mentioned.
Also, of course, I'm sure you mentioned the Pac-Man animated series.
Oh, yes.
Play to win.
You never lose.
When seven of us, the one you choose.
It's a natural kind of taste.
Nothing else comes here.
This is creepy.
This is very creepy.
Only in the 80s.
This was actually on TV.
Yes, it was.
I don't remember ever seeing this.
Pac-Man parody they ever had, okay?
This is like the best thing ever.
Here we go.
Mathman, your mission is... Mathman is not here.
Oh?
Where is he?
He's in the math room.
Okay.
Mr. Glitch, your mission is to eat all the pentagons on the board and no other polygons.
That's right.
Mathman was the greatest Pac-Man parody they ever had.
Thank you very much.
End of discussion.
There is no further debate.
Mathman was the greatest.
Forget that 7-Up commercial.
Math Man was the bomb.
All right.
That's it.
We're going to take a break now here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And if you're listening on the podcast, the good news is you only have to wait like 10 seconds.
For those of you listening live, we need a moment to stretch and refill our drinks and so forth and have a little break here in studio.
But we'll be back in just a few more minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio and some stories coming up.
Xbox 360, we've barely touched on what's going on in Microsoft's world.
Their whole damn E3 lineup might have just leaked to the Internet.
We'll discuss what's been leaked and if it carries any weight or not We'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the 17th of 2009.
We tape live every Sunday here at All Games Radio.
That's www.allgames.com.
We follow the Bobby Blackwolf Show at roughly—see, we're amateur radio.
We can't speak, right?
The Bobby Blackwolf Show It's a fun time, so you should definitely tune in.
Anyhow, we've got more gaming news to get back into.
It's myself and Loki and DarkSakura all joining you on this lovely evening.
And I was just thinking, how funny would it be if somebody didn't get the memo that we moved studios tonight and was showing up at the old studio unannounced.
Funny for us, not for them.
Yeah, I know, exactly.
Funny, not funny.
Alright, we have some Xbox 360 news to get into right now.
Loki.
Apparently there's a new Xbox exclusive
Coming, and this is coming from a new company that Microsoft has purchased, Big Park And apparently they're responsible for such franchises, or at least they had a hand in it For Need for Speed, SSX, and NBA Street And this new game though is supposed to be something that will broaden audiences And will be playable at E3
Huh, let me guess, could it be something that ties in with that motion camera that doesn't exist?
That could be like, you know, a Wii Sports type of game.
I'm gonna guess yes, that's probably what it's gonna be.
Well, that is a completely baseless guess right there, how dare you, sir.
What do I know, I'm not an industry analyst.
So I apparently know nothing about this.
What exactly does it take to have the title industry analyst?
Because maybe I would like to just have that after my name.
You kiss enough ass to get promoted?
Well, I promote myself.
How's that?
At Orange Lounge Radio, I am the industry analyst.
I just promoted myself.
Get a math degree.
Well, you have to be, I guess, on call with big companies and have to help them make decisions.
I don't know.
I can do that.
I'd be good at that.
Whatever.
Alright, well, anyhow, moving on with some other gaming news.
By the way, I forgot to mention it at the top of the hour, but we are going to still be giving away that SmileDK signed copy of PlayStation 2 DDR Supernova 2.
We're going to give that away in a little while.
We'll probably do it around the mailbag segment a little later this hour.
Anyhow, we got some news from Q Entertainment has filed a trademark.
Now, of course, you know I love me some Q Entertainment.
They're the folks that put out Luminous and, let's see, they put out, well, they put out Luminous.
Rez.
No, I'm just kidding.
Yeah, Rez, Every Extend Extra.
If you want to trace back Mizuguchi, who's behind Q Games, he did such great things in Space Channel 5.
99 Nights.
Guardian Hearts Guardian Hearts Guardian Hearts
Yeah, not bloody likely.
But it doesn't sound a little role-playing-ish to you.
Doesn't it?
Like a little bit?
Like Guardian Hearts kind of sounds role-playing-ish.
Or Magical Girl game.
Well, that could be fun too.
But either way, you know I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi, so I would be very happy if he's doing a role-playing game.
As long as it's not like 99 Nights.
But there you have it.
Guardian Hearts possibly coming soon.
Who knows?
Maybe as soon as E3, but don't hold your breath.
Telltale has some new episodic series for E3.
They are...
Well, they're not saying what it is, but then again, these are the people that gave us Sam & Max and Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People and Wallace & Gromit.
But it's also going to commemorate, as far as I'm aware, the fifth year anniversary for the company, which is pretty cool, especially making it while the market's gone to shit.
So...
Hopefully it'll be something really cool.
I'm sure it will.
Everything they've put out so far recently has been pretty cool.
And also, for people who like a good deal, the entire season of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People is half price on Steam until Monday.
Yikes, better hurry.
Yep.
That's pretty cool.
Alright, well, I know I'm curious to see what they cook up next.
That company's been doing very well, you're right.
I think one point you made there is that they've been doing pretty well in the face of companies closing and so forth.
Day of the Tentacle!
Day of the Tentacle!
Day of the Tentacle!
Don't hold your breath, but you never know.
You never know.
It's the only Luke Starks franchise, well, one of them that they haven't touched yet.
Day of the Tentacle, come on!
That's what we need.
Or Maniac Mansion.
Anyways, so...
I don't know, other than Day of the Tentacle, what more can we talk about?
I don't know, how about the supposed, and this is all rumor, lineup for Microsoft's press conference?
Apparently, there is a new industry source, or somebody that's claiming to be an industry source, in tradition of Surfer Girl, who apparently has gone into retirement.
from leaking information.
Game Fork.
This is coming from Twitter.
And they have been tweeting about different things coming from the Microsoft press conference.
Including... So it's not like your normal Twitter where it's like, I just ate a ham sandwich and it was delicious.
No, it's not.
BRB pooping.
Not quite.
By the way, if you want to join the OLR Twitter, we don't put twits like that.
We just like to remind you when the show is live and post other little tidbits about the show.
But we will not share when we are pooping like other people do on Twitter.
I'm like you have time to type that.
If you got to go, you got to go.
Unless you lie about it.
But you could, you know, instead of reading a magazine, you could Twitter from the potty.
And I've seen, I've actually, I have a friend that has updated her Facebook status to say, hi, I'm on the toilet.
Nice.
That's the day and age we live in.
I don't know if I can believe this, but Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus Oxide.
It's apparently a rumor of the Xbox 360 port with that extra added content on there.
You're right.
That's apparently going to be their finale.
And then there's supposed to be a top secret exclusive Xbox 360 title that nobody outside of Konami has been told what this is.
Yet, this guy knows what it is.
Blood and a Four Leaf Clover
Um, which may, um, talk, may follow the, um, other character that was in the game, Paki, and his brothers as H, um, you know, try to pull off a bank heist or something like that, cause that was in the game.
Interesting.
Um, the, a new Peter Milano, uh, project called, uh, codenamed Richter is supposed to be, um, shown.
They're gonna show some stuff about, uh, Forza 3, um, that's gonna be playable, uh,
Alan Wake is going to be there, as well as APB, which is going to be announced, available for the Xbox 360, I'm assuming, unless they're going to be covering games for Windows there.
Splinter Cell Conviction will be on hand, Lost Planet 2, Assassin's Creed 2, Bioshock 2, Halo 3 ODST, which is not surprising.
And then, I think that was it.
Blood and a Four-Leaf Clover
That's a very interesting title for a game.
Yeah, it is interesting.
Although it doesn't really fit with what everyone was thinking the next game was going to be.
Because basically there's a mission where you have this drug deal and there's three people involved.
The first one being Nico from the first game.
The second one being Johnny from the second download content.
And then the third one is some other guy who they're thinking is going to be the third download content player.
And it's all supposed to merge on that one mission But, I don't know, we'll see I guess what happens there Interesting nonetheless though And, you know, Rockstar did say that they are going to announce the next download content So, I mean, we kind of figured that was going to happen anyways But, you know, they didn't confirm that that's the subtitle that they had And then the guys behind APB said yes, it will be at E3
Well, I think some of it holds weight.
I think the fluid thing's going to happen.
I think we all kind of know that
I bet anything that Fluid is a very possible name for this.
Yeah.
Actdeft in chat very plainly says, MGS4 on 360 ain't happening.
That is a hard one to believe, but what about Metal Gear Solid 5?
I don't think they would necessarily have a trailer or anything, but what about an announcement?
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
either waiting five minutes to install a game or, I don't know, making the disk swap that one time.
Oh my god, it takes like two seconds.
Is it such a big deal?
I don't think so, but who knows.
Alright, well, it'll be interesting to see if this actually holds weight at E3.
Because if it does, then this whole little Twitter source is going to be huge in the future.
Watch, they'll blow up to 60,000 followers if it's the case.
Press conference is supposed to be June 1st, 9am.
Tora in chat says, I would gladly disc swap to play Metal Gear Solid 4.
I wish I could be there for the Microsoft conference, but I'm going to be getting into town on June 1st.
I might get to go to Sony's.
Might.
I'm watching both.
I'm not going to go.
I'm not going to even be there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, well, I bet a lot of folks have already been getting it.
But if you are being a good boy or a good girl and waiting until its actual release day, some of the things you have to look forward to.
I'm just going to read you some of the songs that are exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged, at least for a little while.
They do emphasize for a limited time.
AFI, Miss Murder, Audioslave, Gasoline, Black Tide, Show Me The Way, Freeze Pop, Let's Talk More Rock.
Now, see, I thought that song was in...
Rock Band already.
I thought it was too, but they're known as an exclusive game.
Maybe because it was download content.
I don't know.
Three Doors Down, Kryptonite, Alice in Chains, Wood, Blink-182, What's My Age Again.
Again, wasn't that download content?
Or am I mixing it up with Damn It?
I don't know.
Oh, Tora in chat says it's Guitar Hero.
It's a Guitar Hero song.
That's why they're marking it as an exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged.
1970s brings us ABC by the Jackson 5.
That's the other big exclusive song.
The rest of them are all songs you might recognize from the game already.
Some of the ones I personally like, Float On by Modest Mouse.
That's pretty cool.
Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Today, Smashing Pumpkins, I Was Wrong, Social Distortion, Weezer, Buddy Holly.
It'll be fun.
White Wedding, Billy Idol, you gotta have some Billy Idol.
Suzie and the Banshees, yes, Killing Jar.
Pretty decent song list, I don't know, but Loki seems to maybe disagree with it.
It's okay, it's something I'd play off and on, but it's not a game I could really get into like the normal rock band unless they have a more variety of download content like some pop songs and that kind of stuff.
Because they could do that,
But are they?
I mean, ABC, that's definitely poppy, so we'll see.
Well, don't we have Lego Rock Band to come fill in the pop void?
That's true, but that's another game.
That's not this game.
Lego Rock Band I am very interested in picking up just, well, after I see the soundtrack, but...
I don't know.
Thank you for watching!
I know that's not going to happen.
Why not?
They'll charge me twice.
By the way, the chat room always filling in the void when we don't know things right off the bat, off the top of our head.
Which, you know, hey, look.
We know a lot about video games, but we don't have the brain capacity to know everything about video games.
That's why the chat room really helps us out every week.
ActDev says the only Blink-182 songs are Dammit and All the Small Things.
So I guess What's My Age Again actually isn't in there.
Maybe I'm getting it mixed up with SingStar because I have too many music games at home.
I don't know.
So there you go.
Deathwishing calls LEGO Rock Band LEGO Fail Band.
We'll see.
Game's got a little while before it comes out.
Does it get hit with the fail pail?
Hopefully not.
That's my hope.
Well, here's something that may or may not be fail.
It just depends.
There's a splash page for a particular game showing up on Xbox.com.
But I'm pretty sure that splash page means actual release.
So that'd be Wolfenstein 3D.
on Xbox Live, and I kind of hope that it's given the HD treatment, but do you really want to shoot HD red-eyed Hitler in the face?
I don't think it's going to be having the HD treatment, and it makes sense with a new Wolfenstein game coming out in a few months.
That's true, but I think it'd be nice to give it the HD treatment.
It'd be cool.
I don't think it's going to happen.
Cool, but not bloody likely.
Yeah, not likely.
I mean, they didn't really do that with Doom or Duke Nukem, so I don't think they're going to start now.
It'd look weird anyways if he did that.
It'd kind of take away from the cheapness.
Now, what they need to have is Rise of the Triad on there, because that'd be sweet.
Yes.
A lot better than... Actually, it would be kind of cool if Wolfenstein, if they did it, was like co-op or something like that.
That'd be kind of cool too, but they're definitely not going to do that either.
Well, there's a couple stories I have here about GameTap, including they're going to start featuring some of the Microsoft Game Studios stuff, including Age of Mythology, Age of Empires II, Fable of the Lost Chapter, Freelancer, MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, Rise of the Nation, and Zoo Tycoon.
And apparently right now, the U.S.
and Europe...
have uh...
Europe is getting Fable, The Lost Chapters, and MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, and Zoo Tycoon.
And then also, I guess, US is getting Age of Empires 2 and Fable right now.
And the rest are going to roll out slowly later, which is kind of neat.
And then also, GameTap has apparently the rights right now for Panzer Dragoon Saga.
Sweet!
However, they're running into some emulation complexities and
I haven't been able to release it yet.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have a perfectly functioning Saturn emulator already, you know, so it can be done.
And they're all, well, we're not sure if enough people want this game.
So, you know, if we get enough people wanting it, then we'll spend the large development time that's going to take to do this.
Ranma in chat says, run it under XP compatibility.
Doesn't work.
Look at GameTap's own FAQs.
It'll tell you it doesn't work.
I tried that when I was still on the front end system because I can't play Civ 4, which kind of makes me mad.
I don't know.
I see the value of GameTap kind of going down, not up.
I still think it's an alright value.
You do get a lot of freaking games, and at least you're paying for it, so you have that whole good karma thing going on instead of just being a maim whore with all the ROMs.
And there's some decent stuff on there, but damn, they've got some work to do.
And I hate the new front end compared to the old one.
I don't know.
I was kind of dumb and bought a whole year in advance, but whatever.
They got you hooked and then changed it.
Yeah, exactly.
That's what I feel like.
Exactly is what it is.
They got me hooked on something that was pretty awesome and then the rug got pulled out from under me.
I do not like the browser setup.
Blah.
Anyhow.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It'll look a little more like a PlayStation 2.
And apparently now instead of having a Spider-Man looking logo, it'll kind of look just like a PlayStation 2.
Who knows?
Maybe this is just a Photoshop PlayStation 2 box.
But who knows?
It is rumors going around out there.
They actually have pictures of the actual die-cast Step 2.
Do they really?
I mean, I don't know.
It might be a prototype.
But then again, they have a box.
So I don't know.
I'm a little iffy on this.
Doesn't it still seem a little soon?
Well, not necessarily, because if you think about it, remember when we had a rumor like this for the Xbox 360 that it was getting a built-in HDMI port, and sure enough, those pictures leaked out of the motherboard and everything with the HDMI port in it, and then we got the systems with the HDMI ports now.
so I'm not surprised this is going to eventually happen and maybe it's happening right now maybe they think this redesign is what's going to get people to buy it I think they're stupid because it's just like the same you know oh let's take out the backwards compatibility oh let's now take out some of those USB ports oh let's you know do this now put the backwards compatibility back in maybe you'll now you'll be talking but who knows I mean if they're going to I don't know but maybe this is why they keep swearing up and down there's not going to be a price drop because there's just going to be a new system instead who knows I don't know
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
People die?
Yeah.
DarkSakura, your FUs of the week, please.
My FU is going to go to finals, sapping my brain, my strength, my willpower, and any ounce of energy I could possibly have.
I just want to pass, and I want to break.
Loki.
My FU is a stool.
It's hurting my butt.
At least it's not the other kind of stool.
Yes.
That is true.
Do you have a hard stool?
I do have a hard stool right now.
Ew.
You should put that on Twitter.
Let's see.
My FU of the week goes to... I don't really have a lot.
You know what?
Things are actually going pretty good in my life right now.
I can't complain.
Chicago was fun.
Make up something.
No, I do have one.
But I just want to say, you know what?
All things are actually pretty good except...
DarkSakura.com
Anyway, what sucks a little less is your emails.
You email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and DarkSakura dives headfirst into the email bag and reads some of your emails.
And yes, we're also going to be giving away a signed autographed copy of SmileDK.
Signing, SuperNova.
We did have people get all five right.
I'll tell you right off the bat, if you didn't get all five right, sorry, you didn't win.
Play again next time.
But we did have several people that got all five, and we're going to be telling you who won right after the email bag segment.
DarkSakura, who's sending some email to mailbag this week?
The first one is from... Let's see, Taz.
Hey there, this is my first email to the OLR mailbag, and I want to suggest a retro game if it hasn't already been on the show already.
Redundant.
The game is Live Alive, an RPG from Squaresoft for the Super Famicom.
I know about this game.
It was not released outside of Japan, but some unofficial translations are out there in the net.
The real title is...
Sort of a mirror image of Live Alive as with the other lives spelled backwards where you see evil in the second half rather than life.
Some of the stories have a much darker tone, as others may make you cry.
I'm sorry, and others may make you cry.
I really enjoyed the story for the robot in the future, which plays like a survival horror.
I suggest anyone who likes retro RPGs pick up this title.
I'm sure Square won't mind any more about the translated ROM.
It'd be awesome if they add this game to a virtual console.
I'd buy it.
P.S.
My ultimate favorite RPG is Secret of Mana, followed by Xenogears and Chrono Trigger, all are must-plays.
I'll give it a download.
If I have time, I'll give it a download.
Yeah, I've not heard of this game ever, but it sounds very interesting.
That's all I got.
I like listener-submitted classic games of the week.
They know more obscure shit than we do sometimes.
I know of this game.
Do you really?
Yes.
I've never heard of it.
In fact, I think I know someone who owns it.
Wow.
Oh, yeah, this is... Never mind.
Never mind.
Um, this is from, uh, FrozenRay?
I really don't like it.
Oh, GS68, sorry.
Um, hey Jamie, hey Loki, hey Rob, Rob, Rob.
So, by the time you're reading this, your business at ASIN is done.
I hope that it went well.
You've been hyping that up, but no mention of Fanime, which has led me to believe you're not going this year, most likely subsequent years, which means, once again, I'll be the only active OLR listener at Fanime.
Since I'm rather sure OLR at Fanime is not going to happen, I'm going to make a bet.
If you do go to Fanime, after all, I will make myself cosplay as Rei Ayanami at Fanime 2010, and that means the whole universe is going to die.
Yes, they will.
I'll also consider a scheme to get Eye of Judgment to sell a million copies by May 2010, so Loki also has to cosplay a tingle at the con.
It's never going to happen because I think they've stopped making it, so... It's done.
It's done.
If you don't go to Fanime, then I hope to see DarkSakura and maybe, maybe Rob at California Extreme this July.
It's possible.
It's possible.
That is more likely than Fanime.
I do want to confirm, we did not make plans to attend Fanime this year.
Nothing against Fanime, it's a lovely con, but just so much other stuff going on.
I'm actually trying to save up money to go to Las Vegas in July.
For me, I had stuff going on with, you guys know I do some theater stuff on the weekends, and I just had a conflict, so I couldn't do it.
But I hope those of you guys that are going have a lot of fun.
LessThan3, GS68, P.S.
This email is brought to you by the South Bay Home of the Never-Ending Overcast Weather.
However, California Extreme, I have never been and I really want to go.
And this is my year of going to things I haven't done before.
It's fun.
I know.
So I went to ASEN.
How many years did it take for me to finally get there?
Like four years?
So maybe I'll do California Extreme finally.
Well, I hope you don't have my experience of waiting three years to do something and then finally sucking when you do it.
What was that?
Tower of Terror.
Hey, I love Tower of Terror.
It freaked me the hell out.
I can't do it ever again.
Aw, it's fun.
I heart it.
I'm actually trying to go to Disneyland.
I've been in an elevator when it fell two stories.
I know, that can't be fun.
And you know what?
DarkSakura.com
I want to say, chat real quick, chat.orange.com Tora says, it was fun meeting Rob at ASEN.
Thank you, it was fun meeting you too.
Though he looked kind of out of it on Saturday.
Yeah, again, did you hear the part about nine people in the hotel room?
That was the cocaine.
Shut up.
Cocaine's a hell of a drug.
And then somebody who didn't change their name, their recruit number 3972 says, what about Comic-Con?
I would love to go to Comic Con and Miss Victoria has been begging me.
I don't know if you remember her.
She was on the show a while ago when Jamie was out one week.
She's been begging me to go to Comic Con but this year it's not going to happen because we're going to see No Doubt the same weekend.
I want to go to Comic Con just to harass my favorite Marvel people if they're there.
I want to go one year because you run into celebrities all the time there and I'm dying to meet Zachary Quinto because he's dreamy.
But anyway, maybe next year.
This email... Hi, OLR crew.
I just wanted to say after your last show, my girlfriend and I went to Safeway and bought three pounds of bacon for eight bucks and made bacon and pancakes for her mother on Mother's Day.
It was very delicious and it was even more delicious knowing I was helping save Americans from idiots who think swine flu comes from cooked pork meat.
You, sir, are American of the week.
Thank you very much.
Round of applause, please.
Who is this emailer?
AZHP.
AZHP, you, sir, are this model citizen.
I've actually been trying to think of my next big thing that I'm going to do.
And because, you know, it is the summer and, you know, ice cream and stuff, we had this... Bacon ice cream?
We did these questions of the week type thing, and they're all, what custom ice cream flavor would you want?
And no, not bacon, because that's... I mean, seriously, that tastes like crap.
I mean, you just can't...
I don't know, I don't know.
Some things baking cannot make sense.
I'm looking it up.
Candied bacon ice cream recipe.
No, that's not good.
But I thought of a waffle breakfast ice cream.
Now, follow me.
Oh my god, this sounds amazing.
Follow me on this.
Waffle ice cream?
You have waffle ice cream cone bits in there, mixed in there, maple syrup, vanilla ice cream, and because you have to, and I know this probably would not be good, but a little bit of butter...
Dripped in there, you know, just because you need that butter flavor.
Otherwise, you might be able to mix it with the maple syrup.
Oh, I thought about waffle ice cream and I jizzed in my pants.
Wow.
Oh, I see it's the alcohol in here that makes us good.
But I wonder if like if I brought like maple syrup and butter to like a Cold Stone or something like that, they could do that.
Candied bacon ice cream.
Hitstun in chat says, this is why you're fat.
How rude.
How rude.
Oh, he followed it up with .com.
There is a website called ThisIsWhyYou'reFat.com It's great.
I'm also posting It's .com That on my own Twitter, the candied bacon ice cream.
There you go.
Alright, more emails.
Sorry, we gotta finish our All-American email, yes?
P.S.
Oh, no, there's more.
Also, DarkSakura mentioned on a podcast a few weeks that she enjoyed the Toy Story ride very much.
I rode this ride back in July after a trip to Anime Expo, and I thought it was awesome as well.
I don't know if it will make your show roll this week, but the game is slated to be released on the Wii in some form soon.
I didn't know that.
I have heard this.
I have heard this, and I have a friend who loves Disney and is going to be probably buying a Wii just for this game.
The video's on the internet already.
Oh, my gosh.
I hear it's going to have 3D glasses.
I was actually too stunned by another Wii release that I'll be covering later in the show to think about that.
Everyone, I'm looking forward to this game as I love the ride, but the line was atrocious.
That's why you go right before the park closes, no line.
You get in the line and they close off the line.
Anyway, love AZHP.
P.S.
I typed this all up on my Palm Trio cell phone just to prove that you can write a grammatically correct email without the presence of a full keyboard.
As I look it up.
Yes, very well done.
You should be commended.
All-American with good grammar.
You're just like the citizen of the week, honestly.
You win a shiny gold star.
There you go.
Last email.
Can we have like maybe a wiki page?
Gold star email recipients?
Yes.
I mean, we should have something where... Someone make it.
Like a special club...
for people who send just A-plus quality emails, and AZHP is the first inductee.
Yes, someone make it.
I mean, my God.
Bacon, good grammar, everything all in one note.
DarkTetia, you make it.
I choose you.
There you go.
Okay, last email.
This is from Clone627.
Hi, OLR.
I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game has been that it's too soon.
Didn't Army of Two start with the September 11th attack?
So it's too soon for mutual war, but not too soon for terrorist attack that killed tons of civilians.
Just a thought.
And I apologize if any spelling or grammar problems.
My power is out and I'm typing this on the iPhone.
Sorry, you've just been owned by AZHP just letting you know that.
You've been owned.
Ranma has two A's.
This must be about six days in Fallujah, right?
I don't really care, to be honest, with how soon it was.
I think we were just saying it was too soon.
That's probably why they pulled it.
Honestly, I wouldn't play it anyways because it doesn't look good.
I mean, it might be good if you want to play that type of thing, but...
Thanks for watching!
I'm kind of reminded of that.
It's hard to say.
I can't judge it until I play it.
Six Days of Fallujah is not my type of game anyway.
But I'm just saying, just because a game's always getting that buzz doesn't mean it's going to be worth it.
Just saying.
Well, I lied.
There's one more email.
And it's a doozy.
Alrighty.
Hey, y'all.
I had to say it the right way, you know.
First of all, thank you, Rob, for getting the last podcast up in an expedient manner.
I look forward to this being a trend and not an isolated occurrence.
Thanks again.
Well, look at you, Mr. Big Words.
What if it's a Miss Big Words?
It actually is a Mr. Big Words.
Loki, congrats on the twins and thank you for your statement of not wanting to name your children after characters that populate one of your hobbies.
Yet.
It ain't over till it's over.
I have an uncle, a wrestling fan, who named his kids Austin and Hunter and he never hears the end of it.
I know who he named him after too, which is sad.
Steve Austin and Triple H. Oh my god.
I'm sure that if you act in the way that my uncle did, the ribbing will be exponentially worse.
After all, there are lots of jackasses online, including this ginger kid who thinks he writes a hilarious blog.
and Jamie, let me join you in your assessment of Silent Hill 3 although I did have to stop playing it near the end after getting overloaded with the imagery in the game oh god, hell yes Silent Hill 3 stands as one of my favorite Playstation 2 games I only hope that when I get around to playing Silent Hill Homecoming it is fractionally as good as Silent Hill 3 and I'm going to be starting that soon I've got your copy still, Rob
Fun.
Now why I'm really emailing you, I didn't just message you to kiss your ass.
I appreciate ass kissing, by the way.
I know, you could have just kissed our ass and left it at that.
We don't mind.
I noticed something while I was playing Mirror's Edge recently.
The first day I played it, I was getting into the game and looked forward to playing it more.
The second day I played it and enjoyed it more and more.
What's the difference between the gaming sessions?
Music.
The first day I listened to the in-game music, but the second day I was listening to music from my iPod, specifically Nine Inch Nails.
I attribute this fact to my enhanced enjoyment, especially since I spent the third day listening to Dresden Dolls and achieved a similar level of enjoyment.
As I thought back along my history of playing games, I see my music being an integral part of my enjoyment, whether it's listening to Social Distortion while playing Left 4 Dead, Cake, Beck, and Seal while playing Tiger Woods PGA, or Korn Metallica and Rammstein while playing Final Fantasy...
8.
The occasional monotony of playing games was eliminated for me by listening to the music that I love.
It makes me wonder how many of us have felt the same effect.
That is the kind of question I pose to you three.
I think it might be interesting to hear the kinds of music you mix with the kinds of games that you play.
Actually, just to say, I usually prefer the in-game music because I think that the games were...
This is from being a musician myself.
And actually being a person who is getting very much into experience and the identity of something.
It's really been a more recent transformation.
But I think that the music is actually an integral part to the game.
It's part of what defines the action, part of what ties everything in together.
And yeah, a crap soundtrack can break a game, but it's still part of the experience.
You know, so in that respect, I prefer to try it at least a few times through with the original music.
And then if I've played it for a while, then I might try to find something else.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I rarely use custom soundtracks.
As cool as they are, I rarely use them, I find, actually.
Do you for racing games?
That's just what I was going to get into.
Unless it's a Ridge Racer game.
Racing games, I always seem to use custom soundtracks with.
And I like to do, like, driving type of techno, like, you know, boop.
I like to listen to talk radio.
Space Invaders Extreme Thumpin' Soundtracks
I do talk radio if anything else.
Well, there are some games that just after having played them for a long time, I will listen to other stuff, but really it has to be something that I've played for a long time.
Actually, I'll do it when I play RO, because after a while, the music and game really freaking gets on my nerves.
Yeah, I mean, a lot of MMOs, I'm sure, are like that.
But I didn't do it for other games.
I didn't do it for World of Warcraft, and I didn't do it for Final Fantasy XI.
You probably didn't play them enough.
I didn't for the first year.
Alright, any more emails or is that it?
Oh, there's more.
Oh dear.
Just a little more, just a little more.
Alright.
Well, that's all.
I hope that this wasn't too long and that I used semicolons in a way that is effective and grammatically correct.
After all, I didn't used to use that particular piece of punctuation in school.
Thank you for your time, Redertainment.
This message has been brought to you by my Who Killed Amanda Palmer, the solo debut by Amanda Palmer, fucking awesome, and by Olive Garden, my grandma's favorite way to catch food poisoning.
All right, there you go.
Free plug for an indie artist there or something worked in.
I'm all down for that.
By the way... Oh, my God.
What's that?
Amanda totally trumped my bacon ice cream.
What did she get?
Bacon cinnamon rolls.
That's pretty amazing.
Bacon dessert doesn't seem to go well.
Bacon is meat candy!
Bacon is meat candy.
Is that registered yet?
Baconismeatkandy.com?
Anyhow, I've been promising it all night long.
Let's give away... SmileDK Autographing copy of Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.
The five songs we played on the last show we had two weeks ago.
Don't Clock Me, Have You Never Been Mellow, the M.M.
Groovin' mix.
That was the faster mix of the song.
In the Heat of the Night, Rain of Sorrow, and the song you just heard there in the background, Dancing All Alone.
Those were the songs.
Of course, we had to have a song in there by SmileDK.
We had a few people get it right.
I had Bobby, our buddy who is on before us, pick a number.
And he picked the number two.
So we grabbed the second email and the winner of the SmileDK autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2, this is a pretty big prize.
So drumroll please, people, please.
The winner is...
The winner does not have an alias.
So the winner is Lindsay.
Lindsay B. Send in an email that has the right songs all there.
I don't know if she's listening right now, but there it is.
Lindsay B. won.
Congratulations.
I will be sending you an email.
Please make sure we get your address so we can tell Breslow where to send the prize.
Lindsay B. wins the Autograph Smile DK.
So congrats.
Congrats to you.
All right.
Let's get back into some gaming news then.
We gotta!
Yes, we gotta!
SuperCard's DS-1i
and this is independent of actually because usually with these cards you have to use a micro SD card and you run a program on there and you update the program and that kind of stuff well now you can actually update the firmware on the card itself using the included USB adapter and so in theory this could be
I know that there was some more information out there about some new methods that they're going to be implementing in upcoming DSi games.
We'll get into more of that in a little bit.
But that might make that a little bit harder to work.
Well, didn't we always kind of know, like, whenever they say something can't be pirated within five minutes, it is, right?
Yeah.
So, and Actdeft says it in chat right there, you can't stop the homebrew community.
Yeah.
You just can't.
So, I guess that's it then.
DSI has already been cracked.
And how long has it been out?
Two weeks?
Three weeks?
Well, a while if you count Japan.
No, I guess that's true.
Well, some more E3 news.
We talked a lot about some great E3 news earlier in the show, but this, not so great news.
Well, depending on who you're a fan of.
Atari, the once great makers of the 2600 system, a landmark in gaming.
Atari has pulled out of E3.
and what's interesting Atari was always kind of like every year I went to E3 anyway Atari was always kind of a satellite room they were never really on the show floor them and Midway always had satellite rooms so it'll be interesting to see what happens this year oh there you go let's hope Ghostbusters sells lots and lots of copies for Atari or else who knows if they'll be in existence by this time next year for E3 that would be a very sad day that would just be the end of an era indeed but you know Sega not putting out hardware anymore was the end of an era of sorts
Well, you know, there's something else, though, that makes me think that Nintendo hasn't forgotten some of its earlier games.
And it's a game that's called Muscle March, and actually it's put up by Namco.
It's a game that's sort of like a puzzle game meets a Mario Kart meets some weird Simon Says sort of game.
Sunshine and Rainbows?
Oh, and Muscle Bound Men and an Overly Muscled Woman.
We're going on a mission!
Oh my gosh, this game looks silly.
I'm getting it.
I wish.
This looks like Incredible Crisis, but with incredibly scantily clad muscle men.
No, it's like... Do you see how... You have to pose the right way.
It's human Tetris.
Oh god, it's that thing.
It's like that game show.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Ellen does this on her show all the time.
Basically, the premise of the story starts off with a football player, like American football, stealing their protein powder.
And so they're chasing after...
The football player, and as we can see here, an alien takes it once they catch the football player.
They have to chase after the alien.
And basically, the alien and the football player and the guys are running through different walls.
And you have to pose the way he posed when you go through the wall.
And there's a panda bear.
Or, what was that?
A polar bear.
And there is a muscle woman, too, if you're looking for that.
But they're running on rainbow trails.
I mean, this game is too gay for me.
This game totally reeks of Cho Aniki.
Just without being a... And I'm completely secure in my homosexuality when I say that.
This game looks way too gay for me.
I want this game.
Hey, it is, what, only 800 Wii Points?
I guess so.
And that's what, May 29th or something in Japan?
Yep.
So, in fact, I will actually link the article from Joystick in the chat room so that our listeners who are with us live can see it.
But it's... The game is...
Yeah, and there's also this particular place where it freezes the screen.
There's a giraffe poking its head out of the clouds and a pig flying and muscle-bound men pointing.
And gay sex.
Lots of butt sex.
Surprise butt sex.
That's the sound of surprise butt sex, by the way.
That's the bonus level.
Surprise!
Yeah.
Um, well, if you think that's pretty surprising, well then, here's something else that'll blow your mind.
Apparently someone's actually- That blow.
Yes, apparently someone has, uh, developed a pill that will enhance your first-person shooter plane.
Uh, it's called the FPS Brain Pill, and apparently it will, um-
I'll make you see better, I guess.
It's a visual performance enhancing capsule.
I guess when caffeine and guarana are not enough.
I don't know.
For when staying up until 9 o'clock in the morning playing World of Warcraft just isn't long enough.
Well, this way you can see better.
Maybe this will make you see dead people.
Like, two...
Maybe this will give you a heart attack, is what might happen.
I don't know.
Deathwishing in chatroom asks, chat.orange.com asks, so basically it's caffeine?
No, it's not.
It's made up of complex ingredients which nurture the human eye.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
With essential micronutrients that are not sufficiently produced by the body on its own.
These, and among other trace elements, plant extracts, um...
Oh, cartinoids, I'm sorry.
Actually...
Looking through this, these are basically the same things that you find in those eye formulas.
There's actually some really good stuff in here, but really lutein, lycopene, eat a tomato, shit.
Eat a tomato every day, you'll be fine.
Or take a multivitamin.
Multivitamins don't have quite that concentration.
Still, it's a way to get gamers to take their vitamins.
Just eat a fucking tomato.
Well, you can buy it and they have a 110% money back guarantee.
So if you don't like it, then you get more money.
Cool!
I don't like it.
Prenatal vitamins.
Wait, are you suggesting gamers should take prenatal vitamins?
Actually, the stuff that's in prenatal vitamins are pretty freaking good for keeping the body healthy and hand-eye coordination.
Also, it's really good for your hair.
Okay, as long as I don't get pregnant.
No!
That has got to be the single most dumb buddy thing I've ever heard you say.
Really?
Because I've said a lot in the history of this program.
I've said, shut up!
I've said a lot of dumb things.
Oh, but that's not all.
That's FBS Brain Zoom.
But apparently they also have some other stuff that enhances your reaction time.
The FBS Brain Original.
Fortunately, they do not sell anything that will enhance your penis size.
That's the only thing they're really missing.
I'm going to tell everybody, all of our listeners, something right now.
These ads are bullshit!
These products that say they're gonna do this shit, they don't do it!
But 110% money back guarantee!
That's a guarantee you can stick by.
Hey, you get 110% back.
That's more than 100%.
and I'm not saying this as a representative of the company I did work at a GNC and I've been involved in several natural home remedy courses I do believe in natural healing but none of this stuff is going to be an instant fix the way you improve your hand-eye coordination is using your hands and eyes together more you coordinate them through practice
All right.
DarkSakura.com
It's Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1 is apparently the game.
Of course, take this with a grain of salt.
Konami's not confirming this yet, but apparently some information has leaked out this week that the Wii will be getting this game as well as the Xbox 360 and a debut on the PlayStation 3.
Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1.
It's a best of!
That's right, they are going to be pulling some of the best songs from DDR's history and putting it all into one game.
Here's hoping it's not just the Konami originals, because we did already have that game several years ago.
It was called Konomics, but I guess it was the first... And Best Hits.
Best Hits didn't come out in the US.
I know, but it's still the same thing.
I know, this is a little snore.
Way to go.
That took no effort.
You didn't have to have any more step charts made.
You just said, okay, I want this, this, this, this, this.
Hey, it's Konami Originals.
We can take all that.
And we're done.
By the way, I just want to say, chat is kind of going a little haywire right now.
We do tape live on Sunday nights, and live things happen.
Apparently, there's just been an earthquake in Southern California.
Some of our Southern California listeners are saying, whoa, did you feel that one?
So they're saying on the quake side, it was a 4.7, which I don't believe is too bad.
That's just a little wake-up call.
Let's hope this isn't a pre-quake, not an aftershock, but a pre-shock to something that's going to happen in E3 week, because that would suck.
Don't die.
I don't want to be in LA when Big One hits.
Fear not.
It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over.
Oh, shut up.
Shut up.
She lives in Florida anyway.
Exactly.
It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over.
DarkSakura, please save this show from Loki.
There's gonna be another Tony Hawk game.
Who cares?
Actually, this is going to be a peripheral-based game, and it's going to be called Tony Hawk Ride.
And, yeah, this thing is weird.
It's gonna be on Wii, PS3, and 360.
So...
I don't know.
I don't really care.
HitStun would like you to know that he cares.
There you go.
Okay, then you can go check out the official website at thride.com.
Yes, and it's a big old skateboard controller, as rumored numerous times before.
No one's surprised.
Yeah, when I heard this this week, I was like, I thought we already heard this, but I guess it was just kind of under the radar before.
But yep, yet another peripheral to fill up your house.
There you go.
A skateboard controller.
Maybe I'll have to get it.
Maybe put it on top of the boxes in there.
I knew it.
DarkSakura, the minute she hears, oh, peripheral, she's like, ah, fuck, I got to get this game.
No.
The only way, you know what?
There is one game I would have wanted something like that for, and that was, what was it called?
Airtrix, the Sega skateboarding game.
That would have been cool.
Otherwise, no.
You know what?
They should put out the skateboard controller and then they should put out Jet Set Radio.
Like a new version of it.
Would that not?
Especially with the Wii?
Uh-huh.
Hey!
Except you're rollerblading.
You know what, hater?
Haters to the left, please.
Thank you.
So, it's a sequel.
Now they're on skateboards.
It's a little different.
That was lame.
I hate you.
Just a couple more stories, then we'll be taking your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Not just yet, though.
Yes.
We'll let you know when.
So, as I alluded to earlier, metaphoric there,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
Something that's going to be broken really fast, basically, but will hopefully delay releases and that kind of stuff.
I don't think it's going to, but not related to the story, and I'm going to bring it up anyways right now.
We may have talked about it a little bit before.
Kojima Productions has a new teaser page for some secret project, and wouldn't you know it, there is something that looks like a 5, or possibly an S.
So we're either going to get a Snatcher game or maybe Metal Gear Solid 5.
Uh oh.
With a new countdown.
And maybe that's what they're going to show on the press conference that they're saying.
You know, they're going to fucking do it.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Who knows?
We'll see.
Interesting.
TheZoonHD.com
Thanks for watching!
and apparently something very similar to the NXC is going to be the function that kind of drives the handheld.
So in a way, it's their foray into handheld gaming, but not really because it's still kind of like an iPod-ish type of device.
It's still the Zoom.
But here's the other big catch.
And this is why I'm kind of like, you know, very skeptical about this.
Apparently, the Zune HD, you will also be able to play Xbox Live Arcade games either on your Xbox or your handheld.
That's where I stopped believing that this is true.
I think that's too much.
Well, no, it's not necessarily too much.
Only certain games.
It's not all games.
Maybe certain newer games that are developed with both...
I don't know.
I mean, they have some pretty elaborate shit on Xbox Live Arcade now.
I just can't imagine you're going to have something with the power of an Xbox 360 in your pocket.
You know how much noise that'll make?
I mean, but really.
So...
We'll see
Don't talk about that.
I actually have to kind of go to the restroom.
And we got to take calls.
So we're going to open up the Skype line now for your calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Whoa, it's freezing up!
Hi, it's freezing up.
What's freezing up?
Are you having another earthquake?
Whoa, no, it's ringing, but I'm called in.
Oh, there we go.
Hi, introduce yourself for our listeners, please.
It's Deathwishing.
Hi, Deathwishing.
Talk to Jamie while I go to the bathroom.
Hi!
Quick, follow him in there.
We can tackle him.
That's okay, I'd rather not, because the cat also uses that bathroom.
So, what's up?
Fuel.
That racing game?
Yeah.
Fuel?
Yeah, it's awesome.
Or it looks awesome.
I don't know.
I'm on a pre-order thing here and I can't decide which game to pre-order.
It is Red Faction, Guerrilla, or Fuel.
And that looks like Motorstorm on steroids and then Red Faction's Red Faction.
Well, it depends if you want a racing game or more of like, you know, sandbox-y.
Or do I want Global Warming or Mars?
Yeah.
Global Warming for the win, I think.
On the other part, we need to strap down Rosie O'Donnell just to get that thought out.
I'm trying to think here.
A little bit of shocker over here.
You know what happened.
I'm still playing Street Fighter.
I think that's all we need to know.
Cool.
Who's actually your primary now?
Primary?
Yeah, in Street Fighter.
Your main person.
Sagat.
Sagat, no.
Any particular reason?
Uh... Tiger Uppercut.
Is that all?
Oh, and Tiger Knee.
It looks like he's kicking them in the balls.
Just way more hardcore.
I'm still totally taken with using Sakura, of course.
That's because your name's DarkSakura.
But I haven't... If she played more like the one from, like, uh...
You know, like SNK vs. Capcom with her really weird run into her uppercut.
It'd be really cool.
I haven't noticed that.
She plays a lot like an interesting combination of Alpha 2, Alpha 3.
Yeah.
Well, Street Fighter 4 is my first real Street Fighter.
What do you want, Lazy?
Go back and play Alpha 2.
But I'm a young kid.
I have to stick with the young games.
It makes me hip.
That means you're doing research.
You know what?
Respect your elders.
Hi, I'm back.
Respect your elders.
You need to discover your roots of gaming.
Seriously, go back and play Alpha 2.
Young whippersnappers.
Road Rash is better than every game out.
Says you.
Says me.
What did I miss?
You missed Fuel, me wanting to tie down Rosie O'Donnell, and...
Deathwishing
Some people in chat asked if we felt the earthquake, but we're way too far away to feel an earthquake.
The big one could hit LA and we wouldn't feel it up here.
Another gamer pill is called carrots.
They help your eyesight.
Carrots are pretty amazing, actually.
And they do have pills out there, actually, that's just carrots.
Just make sure you get the right hole.
But if you eat...
Wow.
If you eat too many carrots, your face will turn orange.
This is true.
This happened to me when I was a kid.
It happened to a famous person, too.
Did you ever watch The Partridge Family?
Danny Bonaduce?
No, Susan Day.
Really?
Yeah, she pretty much starved herself and ate nothing but carrots, and she turned orange.
This kid has no idea what The Partridge Family was.
Do you know what The Partridge Family is?
Huh?
Oh, God.
All right.
Do you have any final thoughts before I let you go?
Should I pre-order Fuel or Red Faction Guerrilla?
Red Faction Guerrilla.
Okay.
All right, bye.
I'll see you about that.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
I don't know, I just picked the better sounding one.
I have no idea what those games are.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's your one and only Ranma.
What's up, everyone?
Hi, not much.
I was just yelling at the previous listener.
Please tell me you know who the Partridge family is.
I grew up watching the Partridge family.
Come on, get happy.
There's a song that we're singing.
Don't!
Come on, get happy.
Alright, come on.
Everybody knows that one.
Alright, Ranma, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
Did you Twitter from the bathroom?
I did not Twitter for the bathroom.
I left my phone in here.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
All right.
It was just a pee too.
It wasn't a poop.
So it's a lot harder to Twitter while you pee.
And I'm afraid of getting the phone wet.
So I wouldn't want to do that.
You got a point there.
I always have a point.
The chat room is like, ah, whatever.
Anyhow, what's on your mind?
Surely you didn't just call and ask me about my bathroom.
Don't call him Shirley!
Or Shermie.
Speak.
Okay, last week I helped a friend download Patapon 2 and it kind of blew up in our faces.
Like the game literally blew up in your face or what happened?
It was being held trying to download the software to our PSP.
I don't understand.
Like what happened?
Alright, pretty much, we hooked up to my laptop, I'm running Windows 7, so I figured, okay, it'll download.
The Sony software stopped halfway and said, I'm running an unauthorized operating system, this will now shut down.
After doing that twice, we went to an XP machine, started downloading everything, it started running, we downloaded Patapon, we walked out, we come back, the download timed out.
Interesting.
Why'd you try downloading it through the PSP?
Um,
The funny thing is, it wouldn't let her update the firmware.
She was running version 3.7 or something like that.
Holy crap.
Yeah, and we tried to update the firmware, and it was like, it says you're running the latest one.
Well, it sounds like Sony's going to sell tons of copies of this stuff with all these hurdles going on.
I bet I can get that game faster then.
This almost sounds like a challenge.
Is it faster to download Patapon 2 legally or illegally?
This should be like a challenge we do on the show next week.
That might be fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Okay, gotcha.
Interesting.
Well, thanks for the heads up.
I could probably have it in a minute, but I'm not going to.
Do not waste the bandwidth in here.
Alright, so anyway, Rahm, anything else you want to call in about tonight?
Rockman Unplugged is pretty good, and Rahm, in response to nine people in a hotel room at ASIN, need I remind you about Catechon?
Yeah, but that room at Katsukan was much bigger.
You had a suite at Katsukan.
We're talking like a standard two-bed room at ASEN.
I have stayed in rooms where they fit 15 people in there and people sleep on shifts.
I've done it.
Oh, my God.
Now, I'm just...
I'm too old for this.
I'm, you know, no, I mean, and certainly no, you know, disrespect.
I had a lot of fun and, you know, I did finally get my sleep.
But, you know, I definitely, you know, somebody said they could kind of see it in me on Saturday.
I was definitely feeling tired just because, you know, so many people and so on.
So it took me a while to catch up.
I was so dead at work on Monday and Tuesday it was not even funny.
Like I took like a five-hour nap.
It was pretty disgusting.
Did you call out because you had the comp leg?
No, I couldn't.
In my job, you can't really call in sick unless you are really, really sick, especially when you have huge, important projects that have to be done when you teach.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but have a good one, and hopefully the next convention I go to, you'll be there.
Most definitely.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
Later.
Later.
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
But the calls are coming in back to back tonight.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up?
It's the Rob D. Rob, how you doing?
Not too shabby, just got home from work and I'm like, oh my god, has Orange Loader taken calls yet?
I don't know.
We just started taking calls, you're just in time.
I did talk earlier in the show and I did congratulate you on your Street Fighter 4 win.
Thank you very much.
And was talking a little bit about the experience in the hotel room playing on the Xbox 360 and the two arcade sticks, which actually was a lot of fun.
I almost want to get an arcade stick.
They're nice.
I mean, I never thought I'd be one of those guys who actually takes arcade sticks and I despise myself just a little bit more as a human being just for actually being one of those people who uses an arcade stick.
But it's worth it.
How did your panel go?
I never got to ask.
It went really well.
People really got a huge kick out of it.
We ended up getting pretty much an almost full room at the biggest panel room at the convention, short of the main programming area where they have thousands of seats and that sort of thing.
That's amazing.
Congratulations.
I have to admit I'm a little jealous.
And I actually just found out that I have a panel at Otakon, so that's going to be interesting.
Wow.
Well, go you.
I mean, the stuff I saw, I didn't get to see the panel.
I wish you guys would have taped it or something.
We do have a tape.
It's not great quality because it was taken on a really small digital camera.
I think Misty taped it.
Misty gave it to one of Jason, the Crazy Kids brothers.
Gotcha.
I have the video.
I think I'm going to end up subtitling it and seeing how that turns out because you can hardly hear anything.
Or if you're going to do the same thing at the next panel, take a better camera next time.
Be ready.
Be ready with a video camera.
It'll be fun.
Oh, yeah.
But that's great.
The stuff I saw, tell the listeners because we're talking about this panel.
Nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about.
Tell the listeners a little bit about what you did at this panel that had a full crowd.
Well, last year when we went to Otakon, we saw this Sonic the Hedgehog panel and
I'd laugh if they actually listened to this, although I doubt it.
And they did a terrible, terrible job.
The whole thing was, basically, the people who did it took a timeline of the Sonic games and was like, oh, and then Sonic Shovel came out.
Who doesn't remember Sonic Shovel?
And then everyone would go, woo!
And that was pretty much it.
And it sucked.
So we decided, okay, if they're going to do bad video game panels, let's make a good video game panel.
And we realized, what would people actually want to hear about?
What would people laugh at that they don't really know about?
So we decided to compile a list of, like,
some of the worst writing and some of the worst examples of video game tropes.
And we decided to do a little presentation about it and compile an hour-long thing about it with slides, with pre-written stuff.
And it turned out really well.
We have a whole section on stupid Mega Man Robot Masters, bad video game covers, the introduction of Blaster Master and the Americanization of it, where instead of having this basic storyline of this guy battling in a post-apocalyptic world in this
And this is completely true?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, it's hilarious.
And like I said, we did a huge list of it.
And actually, we still have material left over.
And we've actually even gotten some good ideas from some of the people attending our panel as well.
We always ask at the end to see if anyone has anything else.
Honestly, if we wanted to do a two-hour panel and wanted to put in the work for that, we probably could.
So you're like traveling video game comics.
This is pretty amazing.
Yeah, it's fun so far.
We'll see how long we do it and how many cons we can do it at.
Basically, if you'll give us a free badge and we can find cheap hotel, we'll do it.
Alright, well, hey, there you go.
You know what?
Maybe we need to start working on something for Fonamay 2010.
We want to, but California's a little bit far away from us Illinois boys.
Take a look at Southwest out of Midway.
They have some direct flights, so, you know.
We'll work on that for next year.
Alright, do that.
Anyhow, Rob D., any other con thoughts or thoughts in general you want to share tonight?
Oh man, the convention was a lot of fun.
Actually, it's funny, um,
After finals, because I had a couple finals to take right after, I really just need another break from reality, so I'm actually going to be going to Anime North, although I have no panel this weekend.
Which is hilarious.
I'm a con whore at this point.
I have nothing else to say about that.
It'll be my first trip to Canada in a good ten years.
Part of me, even though I'm not doing anything at Fanime, I do kind of want to go just to kind of peek.
Part of me thinks I might end up there at least one day just kind of looking around because I'm supposed to be in the Bay Area anyway.
But we'll see.
We'll see.
I'm a little iffy right now.
Maybe they'll have a game room that doesn't have half the TVs turned off.
Fanime always has a really good game room, actually.
So we'll see.
We'll see.
But I have a lot going on next weekend.
We'll see.
There's a lot.
Rob, any other thoughts for our listeners?
I'd love to talk about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and how we're actually getting some Tatsu with some
I can play as Ryu and Ken.
Oh, wait.
Wait, not that Ken.
But no, I'm excited for that coming to the U.S.
or at least very, you know, almost confirmed for the U.S.
and everything else.
Since you just joined us, did you hear that they have kind of looked at one of the screenshots and you can tell that three characters have already been axed, which we kind of figured was going to, you know, we said when we were kind of talking about this earlier in the show, we were like, well, wait a minute.
Maybe they got the licensing, but don't guarantee that they got all of it.
And sure enough, three of the characters have been cut, apparently.
That's interesting.
I didn't know about that.
I'll have to look into that.
But I guess it's not too surprising considering that's just a nightmare in the U.S.
and any other country other than Japan.
Exactly.
And folks are asking again which characters got axed.
Do you remember, Loki, or where you read that?
Do you remember who the ones were?
I think one of them was Condor Nojo.
It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and I don't remember the last one.
are something real, real, real, I don't remember.
Yeah, real, real.
Exactly, real.
No, not real.
Licensing for real.
Somebody in chat will yell it out in just a moment.
That's what usually happens once they get through the delay.
So, uh... Will Kiyot from Battle of the Planets be in there or Ace Goodheart from GeForce?
Sorry.
I don't think everybody else is still in there.
We'll see.
Rob, we better let you go so we can get some more calls.
Thanks for the call and congratulations again.
Good luck with your traveling band of comedy.
Thank you very much.
I'll see you later.
Take care, buddy.
We've got time for a couple more calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We can probably squeeze at least one more call in before the night's up.
Go ahead and give us a call.
Do we have any last-minute stories real quick before we say goodnight?
Yes, I've been collecting them.
Hold on, we got a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's GS-68.
Hi, GS-68.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Don't bother responding to me next year.
I think ASAN needs some more of your attention.
Wait, what's this?
Don't bother responding to me.
Nobody from the area listens to all the lore besides me.
I know we've skipped out on the past two years.
It just hasn't worked out.
But dude, ASEN is expensive to go to.
I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it again next year.
So I definitely want to keep it local, I think.
Here's something else.
Go ahead.
At least there are listeners who go to ASEN, but I don't know anyone who would go to...
Thanks for watching!
I've been falling out from the DDR scene.
I haven't played DDR regularly in a long time.
Yeah, so, you know, we'll definitely make it back probably next year, because next year also is, I'm trying to plan, I don't know if it's really going to happen, but I'm having an idea for a Japan tour dangled in front of me, and I kind of want to do it.
So it just depends on money and all that good stuff.
But if I do that, then no trips to the Midwest next year, or even probably the East Coast, because Japan will... Yeah, I will be...
Most likely to make a con report during the con or the week after, and I'll also be leaving updates on Twitter about the con at the front of May.
Hopefully.
I also want to talk about, like, last week or so, there was a new version of a PC game that Reni plugged on the mailbag several episodes ago, and it has speedrun mode after you beat the games.
They got me thinking.
Sorry, which game is this?
A version.
It's a cutesy platformer game where you run around, like, change worlds and collect gems.
Oh, yes, okay.
Yeah, there's a new version where after you beat the game, there's a time attack mode.
And they got me thinking, more games need that kind of stuff.
I mean, it kind of, I mean, it gave me the sense to play the game again.
And on that topic...
It irks me when people say, oh, stop speedrunning the game, or stop playing for score, just have fun.
I mean, there are ones now impeding on the fun of people like me who like to play for time or for score, and some people playing for score for time is fun, so...
These kind of people seem to let everyone play their own way.
It's your fucking quarter.
Do what you want.
Everyone else can buzz off.
As long as you're not breaking the machine or doing things, just do what you want.
It's your quarter.
Yeah, last week I was in another chat room and I was talking about Guitar Hero scoring the whole multiplier thing and someone was yelling at me saying, No, nobody cares about the scoring of Guitar Hero.
It's all about the music.
And I'm like...
Okay, but what about the people who do play for score?
I should maybe revive pop music freestyle.
Oh God, poppin' music freestyle.
I don't know about that one, especially because there hasn't been a new consumer one in a long time.
I know, it was in a movie once, like a couple years ago.
They had some guy doing it.
Lost in Translation?
Yeah, yeah, it was Lost in Translation.
But yeah, there hasn't been a lot of movement in that scene in a while.
But also keep in mind, there's been no poppin' music consumer style in quite a while.
Yeah.
We haven't seen, yeah, there's a
Poppin' is going through what I call 2DX Consumer Syndrome now.
Kind of like how there's a huge delay between 2DX 6 and 6 on PS2 and then another delay between 6 and 7.
Oh yeah, I remember that.
It could be, it could be, but I, you know, if Konami were smart, they would just nuke all of their franchises and start them over again on PlayStation 3 or next-gen hardware.
PlayStation 3 would be good because then you can import that.
There you go.
It'd be nice.
I know, I didn't get started on Poppin' like last October, so it'll be,
Nice that we can see 15 and 16 on PS2.
Maybe as a single compilation, so that way the series will be caught up.
We'll see.
I mean, the rumor is the next 2DX on PlayStation 2 is just going to have a crap load of songs.
But rumors are rumors.
We'll see.
Anyway, GSC Steel, we've got to let you go.
We need to go and wrap up the show.
But thanks so much for your call.
And have fun at Faname.
And we expect a full report next week.
Alright, okay, bye.
Anyways, so where was I?
Oh, um...
So apparently there's a rumor that Battlefield Heroes is going to be headed to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Network, and Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade.
As you remember, I believe Battlefield Heroes is the free-to-play game that they have online, kind of a deathmatch-only flair.
But apparently it's listed as coming out in June 2009, according to EA's press page.
And perhaps this is something they're going to be...
Talking about during E3, maybe?
Might be neat.
Also, for Wii Sports Resort, there's been two more games revealed from a Japanese commercial.
Apparently, golf and table tennis will be in Wii Sports Resort.
You may remember table tennis was in Wii Play, and golf was in the original Wii Sports.
Awesome!
They're recycling minigames now.
Go Nintendo!
Wow.
Um...
Let's see.
But now it's more precise.
But yet they don't have... Well, they have table tennis, I guess, but they don't have...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
The object of the game is to win hands in order to remove articles of clothing from still images of female characters.
Nurses, police, women, office workers, and sports figures can eventually be stripped down to show their bare breasts.
Ooh, adult games on the Wii.
Yeah, I remember strip poker games on the Commodore 64.
They were epic.
Yeah, but you'd think something like this.
Pixelated boobies.
They just wouldn't be, you know, coming out on the Wii, because the Wii's a family system, so it's kind of surprising.
There's a... This is kind of interesting.
Hull Breach Online, the first MMORPG for the Wii's internet channel, has now apparently been scaled down to run on the DSi browser.
So yes, it's a free-to-play MMO, and apparently space-themed, and looks very basic, but I can imagine that you can't really do too much with the DSi browser.
Kind of limited.
Um...
And then a little bit more information about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
The game's now being called Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars.
And apparently online play may be added in.
New characters might happen, and it's supposed to be due out before the end of the year.
I was wondering, though, because after some thought, the characters that you were saying were cut were never in the Japanese version to begin with.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
and then finally it's kind of interesting coming from CodeJunkies.com they have a new accessory that's out now for the Xbox 360 they apparently have figured out how to reverse engineer the memory cards now you can get a device for as cheap as $39.99 and it will use micro SD cards so you can store up to 16 gigabytes of data on there and if you think about that
Since it doesn't have all the backwards compatibility stuff like the Xbox 360 hard drives, it's actually larger than the Xbox 360 20 gig hard drives.
Nice.
Now in memory card form, so you can get these really cheap.
And, you know, micro SD cards, those are pretty damn cheap nowadays, especially the 4 gig and, like, 16 gig ones.
I think I just got a, well, it wasn't a micro SD, but just a standard HD card for 50 bucks at 16 gigs.
So, I mean...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Maybe.
I don't know yet what I've got going on.
But maybe.
I do want to see it again.
Loki, your final thought?
This chair hurts my butt, and I'm going to play some Bion Commando this week.
Awesome.
I don't really have much of a final thought, except I'm excited to be going to L.A.
in a couple weeks, and things are good.
So that's it.
Hopefully I get to play more games this week.
That's my final thought.
