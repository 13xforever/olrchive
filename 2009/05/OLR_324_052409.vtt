Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, May 24th, 2009, an OLR favorite game is getting remade on the DS and Wii.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Did Sony confirm the smaller PS3 with their lawsuits?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Will I soon be able to rent games on my PSP?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
And joining you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Porn!

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
How are you doing?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Porn.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Nah, I just wanted to say porn.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Is he internet for porn?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I wanted the first word that I said on the show tonight to be porn.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Alright, well there you go, it was.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Second word of the show, official word of the show.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yes.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Tribble.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Alright, so are you into Tribble porn or something?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
No, I want to see Star Trek again.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh dear.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
For the third time in the theater.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
And then we went back to Becky's house and watched Tribble with Tribbles and then Trial and Tribulations.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Did you see the new, the HD?

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Because apparently they remade a bunch of Star Trek episodes in HD.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
I have to tell you.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Everyone who goes to see the movie or goes to see it again, when they first show Scotty, look on his desk, there's a Tribble.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Nice. OMG spoilers.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm just kidding.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
Okay, like the Tribble, oh and the way they defeat the guy is Tribbles.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
So since you brought up porn, what would you say is your favorite porn?

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
The boneheads.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
I have actually not seen much in the way of porn, but the boneheads.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
My favorite porns are the ones that are based off of like, you know, movies and stuff too.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Ally McKeel was pretty funny.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Ally McKeel is one of my favorites.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
But the boneheads is a parody of Coneheads where they had collapsible head attachments.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
That was actually the first one I saw.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Nice.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
And my favorite animated, Bible Black.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Sorry.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Bible Black is kind of cool.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
It's all good.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Hey, look in the chat.

02:10.000 --> 02:20.000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com is always there when, you know, every night, every week that we tape this show, you guys are always there to entertain us with your chat comments.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
And we have Tigerclaw says, Sky, the classic Star Trek series in HD is now available in Blu-ray.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
And yeah, I've heard about that.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Plus all the old movies are available in Blu-ray too.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
But wake me when they have the next generation movies in Blu-ray.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I love the Mesa Summa.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Tribble porn.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Aren't Tribbles born pregnant?

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
By the way, if you pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Nice.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
One Night Stands in Chat says, I just saw a porno called Six Fags, Magic Mount Him.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
I want to see that.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Yeah, that sounds funny.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
See, those are my favorite ones.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
The ones that are based off of actual movies.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
And no, Final Fuck X was crap.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Good cosplay.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Really crappy porn.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
We talk about games sometimes on this show.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
But you're probably wondering, where's Loki?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
You haven't heard him yet.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, I mean, I know.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
We gagged him with duct tape and taped him in the closet of his house.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Porn gets brought up and where's Loki to comment.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
But sadly, he's not here tonight.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
But it's for a good reason.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
You may or may not have heard.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Loki is now a homeowner.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
He got the keys to a house this week.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
So him and Mrs. Loki have moved into the house.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
But they have, you know, when you first move into a house, I don't know how many of you

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
know this, but there's like a million things you have to take care of when you're a homeowner,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
especially if you're buying a fixer-upper, which I believe they did.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So they're fixing up some things right now.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
But he will be back next week.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
It's just temporary.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
He's out tonight.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
We are going to talk about the latest and greatest in video gaming, starting off with

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
our gaming weeks.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I do want to tell everybody, though, up front, because of the holiday, because of the fact

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
we have no Loki and because of the fact it's kind of a short news week, we do have a short

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
show tonight.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
We're only going to be going for about an hour and a half tonight as opposed to our

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
usual three hours.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
So apologies to those of you that were hoping for the long show tonight.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
But it's kind of a holiday.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
So we're going to take it easy tonight.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
But we still have your calls.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
It's not a drunk show, though.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
It's a beer show.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
That's right.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Dark Soccer is drinking beer.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
I, however, due to everything I went through last year, I'm not drinking.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
I have vodka.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I have Odwalla.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I have low fat.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
I can't.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Just alcohol in general is a bad idea.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I have some rubbing alcohol.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I have wine once in a while.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I have witch hazel.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I have wine once in a while.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
I have wine.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I don't want wine.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I have witch hazel.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I've got to be sober tonight.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I've got to be sober for the kids since you're setting a bad one.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I have peroxide.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
All right.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Look.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Shut up.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Shut up and tell us about your gaming week.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I played Sims.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
That's about it.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
That's it?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Really?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Really.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Because, dude, I've been so...

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Oh, you had finals this week, huh?

04:29.000 --> 04:33.560
I had my last final on Monday, and after that, I was like, brain.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.000
But no video games to kind of fill in that void?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
That's usually what I do.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Why the hell do you think Sims is?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
It's a video game.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
It uses my video card.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That's true.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
That is one you'll get sucked into.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.960
Well, what kinds of things have you been enjoying in Sims?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.920
Are you prepping for the release of Sims 3?

04:45.920 --> 04:46.920
Kind of.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.600
But I've been enjoying porn in Sims.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.160
I've actually found a bunch of naughty items that I just was curious to see how they worked,

04:52.160 --> 04:54.240
so I downloaded them just to see.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.300
They're really horrible.

04:56.300 --> 04:59.760
Why do you think people go instantly to doing dirty porno things?

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
Is it just because they can?

05:00.760 --> 05:01.760
The first things that you learn...

05:01.760 --> 05:02.760
Okay.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.980
It goes back to the first things that you learn in any language is how to cuss and how

05:05.980 --> 05:08.600
to talk about sex.

05:08.600 --> 05:13.000
So the first thing that you do in any game, find all the dirty crap, especially if you

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
didn't mod it.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.480
How else do you think they found hot coffee, please?

05:16.480 --> 05:19.600
How else do you think hot coffee got in the damn game?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.640
They were gonna have some nookie in that game, hell yeah.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.840
So but no, really what I've been doing, and actually my two favorite things to do is to

05:25.840 --> 05:34.240
play with the Sims body shop thing where you can, you know, if you download different skins

05:34.240 --> 05:37.180
and everything, you can make your own Sims look pretty cool.

05:37.180 --> 05:41.680
Like I showed Rob one that I made of a couple of characters I used to have, and I've even

05:41.680 --> 05:46.720
done one for, you know, quite a number of my old tabletop game characters are pretty

05:46.720 --> 05:48.720
cool.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
I did one of me.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.000
I'm gonna do one of Rob just because it's funny.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.560
I want to see what that looks like when he finished.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.560
The Rob Sim.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.560
I might not do it in the show, but I don't know.

05:57.560 --> 05:58.560
No later.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
You still need to meet later.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.880
But the other thing I like doing is building houses, and I've actually built some pretty

06:04.880 --> 06:05.880
freaking...

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
My first house was shit.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.880
Okay.

06:07.880 --> 06:08.880
I just...

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
The first house was crap.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.480
The first house I built, though, is pretty damn cool, and I love it, and I would actually

06:12.480 --> 06:14.660
live in that house if I could.

06:14.660 --> 06:22.240
So I've been, you know, sort of letting out an artistic thing, you know, something that's

06:22.240 --> 06:25.080
been lagging, you know, while I've been in school.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.080
My art...

06:26.080 --> 06:30.800
I guess my artsy stuff has been focused toward my assignments, towards this theme, that theme,

06:30.800 --> 06:34.340
getting this done, getting that done, and I've really just sort of enjoyed having kind

06:34.340 --> 06:38.840
of a point and click kind of artistry lately, you know, where I don't have to really use

06:38.840 --> 06:41.600
my brain so much, I can just pick things as I want to.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.080
It's been pretty cool.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.920
You might need to play some Ragnarok this week, because I'm thinking about signing up,

06:45.920 --> 06:46.920
because...

06:46.920 --> 06:47.920
Really?

06:47.920 --> 06:48.920
I haven't played Ragnarok in about a month now.

06:48.920 --> 06:49.920
Wait a minute.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
Wait a minute.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.640
This is the same girl who every week is like, oh, you should sign up on my server.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.320
You should sign up and play some Ragnarok.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.320
And now that I'm finally...

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
If you sign up and play with me, I'll play.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
All right.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.660
Because I might do that, because, you know, transitioning into my gaming week, I was playing

07:00.660 --> 07:06.280
a little bit of World of Warcraft this week, of course, as usual, but there's theatrics

07:06.280 --> 07:07.280
going on.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
We'll leave it at that.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.240
But there's theatrics, and it's just kind of making me go, whatever.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.280
I mean, I play games for fun.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.880
I don't know why everybody else can't do the same thing.

07:14.880 --> 07:19.320
But yeah, so I'm thinking about, you know, just chilling out in another game for a little

07:19.320 --> 07:20.320
while while I can.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.160
Because life's going to get very busy with, you know, in a couple weeks being E3 and everything

07:24.160 --> 07:25.160
going on.

07:25.160 --> 07:29.180
So, you know, now's a good time to sell me on other MMOs if you want to get me to check

07:29.180 --> 07:30.180
it out.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.320
Even part of me was like, I should go back and check out Final Fantasy XI, but then I

07:32.320 --> 07:35.320
was like, no, that's really a bad idea.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.320
That's a bad idea, Rob.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.200
That's a disaster waiting to happen.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.200
It is.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.480
And I'm thinking of starting on Perfect Life, now that I finally got it downloaded.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.840
But, you know, Star Trek Online's going to be coming out before too long.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.840
Yeah?

07:45.840 --> 07:46.840
And, oh my god.

07:46.840 --> 07:47.840
I can't wait for that.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.840
So freaking playing it.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
Hells yeah.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
I'm so there when that comes out.

07:50.840 --> 07:51.840
Other games in my gaming week.

07:51.840 --> 07:52.840
You know, I haven't actually played an awful lot.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.320
I know, it's kind of like, it's affecting both Jamie and I.

07:55.320 --> 08:00.000
But I did fire up the 360 earlier this week and was still playing some Space Invaders Extreme.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.240
And I finally bought Outrun, because I checked out the demo like a while back, but I finally

08:04.240 --> 08:05.560
actually had some time to sit down.

08:05.560 --> 08:10.840
I was like, I want a fun arcade racer, and hello Outrun on the Xbox Live Arcade.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.920
And you know, fun little game.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.880
I like racing games that are not complex, like Outrun.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.600
You know, I can't get into the Forza, because I don't know enough about cars, and I don't

08:20.600 --> 08:21.760
like to customize my cars.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.720
I just like to step on the gas and go.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.600
And Outrun is a fun, you know, it always has been a great little arcade game.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.480
And I like the one on Xbox 360.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.480
It's fun.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.480
I need to play more of the multiplayer, though.

08:30.480 --> 08:34.460
I only really checked out single player this week, and was trying to beat it, and would

08:34.460 --> 08:39.680
come so close, and can't seem to beat it, because I suck at video games.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
No, I don't know.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.920
I just, I didn't, I guess, spend enough time with it.

08:42.920 --> 08:43.920
I don't know.

08:43.920 --> 08:44.920
But yeah.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.600
Otherwise, now I've been watching some movies, and you know, just catching up on some other

08:48.600 --> 08:51.840
stuff around the house, and other things going on in my personal life.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.200
Tomorrow's gonna be a big video gaming day, though.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.840
I don't have a lot of other stuff planned, so my things to do are clean and play video

08:58.840 --> 09:01.080
games, and to get in a bunch of things before E3.

09:01.080 --> 09:07.400
So I had a Twitter message asking me to check out Team Fortress 2, which I'm gonna try to

09:07.400 --> 09:09.400
do tomorrow.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.800
Also I really need to get in and play more Left 4 Dead, so I might make it a PC day tomorrow,

09:13.800 --> 09:17.320
but I also want to go back and visit some of my Xbox 360 RPGs, like, I don't know why.

09:17.320 --> 09:22.200
I have this real itch to go back and do Lost Odyssey, because I only really got through,

09:22.200 --> 09:26.520
like, maybe the first third, or the first half, and I really want to go and finish that.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.800
So we'll see.

09:27.800 --> 09:32.720
So, um, yeah, that's my plans for this upcoming week.

09:32.720 --> 09:33.720
How about you guys?

09:33.720 --> 09:35.040
Did you guys have a good gaming week?

09:35.040 --> 09:36.040
I'm looking at chat room.

09:36.040 --> 09:41.120
Uh, Cheeseburger says, I saw Star Trek twice already, and I'm gonna see it again.

09:41.120 --> 09:46.640
Uh, Unfolded Raptor says, I've been playing Bionic Commando all day, and I'm already 63%

09:46.640 --> 09:47.640
done.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.040
I'm kinda curious how fun that is.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.680
I've been hearing some mixed things on it, so I'm kinda curious what our chatters think

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
of that.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.280
Certainly I like the old school one.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.280
And I like the redone old school one.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.640
That was a real fun one on Xbox Live Arcade.

10:00.640 --> 10:05.120
Um, uh, let's see, also GameGuru asks, when is E3?

10:05.120 --> 10:10.200
E3 is not this upcoming week, like tomorrow, but it's a week after, like it starts a week

10:10.200 --> 10:11.200
from Tuesday.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.640
June 2nd is when it starts, and I'll be going down there Monday night.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.640
So we're still gonna have shows, actually, through E3 week.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.740
Because Dark Sakura is not going, I do not believe we're going to be doing anything live

10:22.740 --> 10:28.200
from E3, but stay tuned to the Twitter and to the website, you never know what surprise

10:28.200 --> 10:29.200
we might have cooked up.

10:29.200 --> 10:33.520
I am gonna take my video camera, but, um, as I was telling Bobby earlier, Bobby Blackwolf

10:33.520 --> 10:37.700
who's before us here on Sunday nights on All Games Radio, I don't think there's a lot we

10:37.700 --> 10:40.440
can do that all the big websites aren't already gonna do.

10:40.440 --> 10:45.240
You know, we're not gonna be the first to report on the news, we rarely are, you know,

10:45.240 --> 10:49.120
we're not gonna really be, you know, on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest E3

10:49.120 --> 10:50.120
news.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.280
All we can do is say, hey, you guys have been reading what's going on at E3, what do you

10:54.280 --> 10:56.120
want us to dig and find?

10:56.120 --> 10:59.680
We're your reporters on the show, we're the show where every gamer has a voice, what do

10:59.680 --> 11:01.060
you want us to find?

11:01.060 --> 11:04.840
So we'll be definitely using Twitter and the website and some of the things to find out

11:04.840 --> 11:10.040
what you guys want us to dig up at E3, so look for that and our reports, be it in video

11:10.040 --> 11:12.460
form or other tweets or what have you.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.680
So we'll be looking at that.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.080
I guess that's pretty much all I have to say for housekeeping tonight, too, there's not

11:17.080 --> 11:21.800
a lot of housekeeping items or things to talk about what's going on, but if you aren't following

11:21.800 --> 11:25.980
us on Twitter, check it out at OLR, please be kind and leave us a nice five-star review

11:25.980 --> 11:29.520
on iTunes as well if you enjoy what you hear because we do the show for free.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.700
Unfortunately, I saw a nice one-star one on there the other day and that's always a bummer,

11:33.700 --> 11:37.560
it's like, dude, and I'm sure the person listens to this show because it seemed like the kind

11:37.560 --> 11:40.560
of thing where it's just to get a rise out of us, it's like, dude, we do this stuff for

11:40.560 --> 11:45.280
free and it's like reading stuff like that is really disheartening, you know, leave five-star

11:45.280 --> 11:49.280
reviews for the show you like, but what good is it to leave a one-star review for these

11:49.280 --> 11:51.760
other shows and people that work hard, you know?

11:51.760 --> 11:53.200
Unless they're really crap.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.320
You know, I would like to think we're not really crap.

11:56.320 --> 12:00.160
You know what, Rob, I honestly, I don't care.

12:00.160 --> 12:05.440
I don't, but it sucks because that, and I blame Apple, it affects your ranking on the

12:05.440 --> 12:10.040
whole, if you go in and look at the lineups of the shows in there, we were on page one

12:10.040 --> 12:13.720
and now we dropped page three, and that's kind of disappointing, you know, that's the

12:13.720 --> 12:18.080
only thing that bugs me about it, otherwise I don't care, but I must say, if you have

12:18.080 --> 12:21.640
feedback or something you think we should be doing better on the show, send us an email,

12:21.640 --> 12:27.640
mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, you know, do that, I'm kidding, all right, anyhow, that

12:27.640 --> 12:30.720
being said, I don't want to get it too far into that, I paid that way too much attention

12:30.720 --> 12:36.200
than it deserved, how about some gaming news, shall we, all right, hey, kind of a follow-up

12:36.200 --> 12:40.040
to something we were talking about last week, 3D Realms, and we were talking about how 3D

12:40.040 --> 12:44.920
Realms went under quote-unquote and took Duke Nukem Forever with it, well, this is interesting

12:44.920 --> 12:50.000
because apparently 3D Realms actually released a public statement this week, you know, after

12:50.000 --> 12:54.360
the whole development team was dissolved that was working on Duke Nukem Forever, and they

12:54.360 --> 12:59.780
said they are not closed and they are not closing, however, they are saying that Take

12:59.780 --> 13:05.140
Two will be retaining the publishing rights to Duke Nukem Forever and they will be able

13:05.140 --> 13:09.320
to sell the game directly to the public, but what's interesting, now they're coming around,

13:09.320 --> 13:12.700
they're kind of doing this little mudslinging there with Take Two, they're saying that Take

13:12.700 --> 13:18.720
Two has actually bullied 3D Realms over the past year on their negotiation, what's going

13:18.720 --> 13:25.240
on, and that 3D Realms is saying that Take Two tried to force a sale out of the situation

13:25.240 --> 13:29.680
and 3D Realms left the table essentially, but you know, I can't help, I don't know,

13:29.680 --> 13:33.320
I feel like there's two sides to every story and I still can't help but think, guys, what

13:33.320 --> 13:35.780
were you producing on this game?

13:35.780 --> 13:40.500
There was not a lot of public buzz going on because they refused to release screenshots,

13:40.500 --> 13:45.020
there was no demo, they hadn't shown at E3 for years, what did they expect was going

13:45.020 --> 13:46.020
to happen?

13:46.020 --> 13:49.800
I mean, as much as I was excited for Duke Nukem Forever like the last guy, tease us

13:49.800 --> 13:53.980
a little bit with something, you know, and I understand Take Two probably had the open

13:53.980 --> 13:58.680
book and they got to see everything that was going on, but still, I mean, it's a business

13:58.680 --> 14:02.360
and if people aren't, it's tough to sell a game in this day and age with, you know, look

14:02.360 --> 14:06.320
at Prey and how kind of disappointing that ended up being sales-wise, you know, if there's

14:06.320 --> 14:11.840
not the buzz out there for the game, it's not going to be pretty, and I bet you anything

14:11.840 --> 14:15.080
now that Take Two does have the rights to this, we're going to see this game out in

14:15.080 --> 14:19.680
a year or two, tops, two years tops, this game comes out.

14:19.680 --> 14:26.840
Well, we can, if it ever really does, I mean, honestly, I sort of lost my expectation of

14:26.840 --> 14:28.160
it really coming out.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.520
I guess that's true, and you know, I don't even think at this point it might be a subpar

14:31.520 --> 14:34.960
game, but I don't know, I'm not going to write it off completely, never write off a game

14:34.960 --> 14:37.320
until you play it, that's what I'm planning to do.

14:37.320 --> 14:41.200
Well, here's a game that some people might get to play if they have a Dreamcast, it's

14:41.200 --> 14:48.040
coming up for Windows, Linux, and Dreamcast, yep, it's a homebrew game called Hypertension

14:48.040 --> 15:01.560
and it is a re-imaging of Blood, which is a Doom-based, uses the Doom-based engine.

15:01.560 --> 15:08.360
So yeah, it's kind of old school in that sense, but it's coming out on Dreamcast, so hey,

15:08.360 --> 15:11.280
why not if you got it, buy it, I guess.

15:11.280 --> 15:21.200
I'm looking a little bit at the play from it, and I'm really not impressed, I mean,

15:21.200 --> 15:26.600
then again, it's old school, it's Doom-like, is that not, well, I don't know, it's got

15:26.600 --> 15:31.080
some 3D, I guess, but it's not pixely, meh.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.960
It looks a little like, yeah, Doomish.

15:32.960 --> 15:33.960
It's quaky.

15:33.960 --> 15:38.000
Doomish meets, yeah, kind of in that vein, the early 90s, or I guess maybe the mid-90s.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.080
But the weapon is aerosol and a lighter, I love it.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.480
But I mean, is there really a market for these types of Dreamcast games, it's kind of funny,

15:46.480 --> 15:51.320
I don't know, does everybody report on these games because it's like, OMG, new Dreamcast

15:51.320 --> 15:52.320
game, who would've thought?

15:52.320 --> 16:00.180
It's a homebrew, I think it's notable, you know, there's being homebrewed, you know,

16:00.180 --> 16:01.180
that's about it.

16:01.180 --> 16:05.600
And people still love the Dreamcast, I guess, I do.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.480
I guess, and one thing I did love about the Dreamcast is that there was so much homebrew

16:09.480 --> 16:12.920
available for it, you know what I play most of all on my Dreamcast?

16:12.920 --> 16:13.920
NES emulator.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.840
I mean, honestly, that's one of the greatest things about it, although, I bested out Marvel

16:17.840 --> 16:21.720
vs Capcom 2 the other night, yeah, yeah, good times.

16:21.720 --> 16:26.520
So you did do some gaming this week, of Dan did, a little bit, we is in my household.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.520
Gotcha.

16:27.520 --> 16:32.440
Well, hey, another first person shooter that's pretty popular, Metroid Prime, you know why,

16:32.440 --> 16:36.840
because it's one of the few AAA first person shooters that they have on the Nintendo Wii,

16:36.840 --> 16:39.640
although granted, there's some others in the works or what have you, but, you know, Metroid

16:39.640 --> 16:41.320
Prime, you'd definitely say is established.

16:41.320 --> 16:46.160
The Metroid series is a hugely established franchise.

16:46.160 --> 16:50.520
Of course, Metroid Prime 3 was the only one that's been released on the Wii in this country,

16:50.520 --> 16:55.120
however, Metroid Prime 1 and 2 were re-released over in Japan, kind of the whole new Wii controls.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
Well, guess what?

16:56.120 --> 17:01.400
Nintendo announced this week that the Metroid Prime trilogy will be coming to the US, and

17:01.400 --> 17:05.160
that means that Metroid Prime will be kind of repackaged, the first two games will have

17:05.160 --> 17:09.420
the new Wii controls and the whole wide screen graphics, which, you know, I bet a lot of

17:09.420 --> 17:13.380
people have mixed feelings about, but if you never really bought one or two, you know,

17:13.380 --> 17:15.640
this might be a good way to revisit those games.

17:15.640 --> 17:19.680
The only bummer is, no news here about Metroid Prime 4.

17:19.680 --> 17:24.720
You know, if you have a Metroid Prime trilogy, and it kind of insinuates there may not be

17:24.720 --> 17:28.900
a Metroid Prime 4, but I do have that hope that maybe that's one of the surprises they're

17:28.900 --> 17:32.320
going to pull out at E3, but, I don't know, I wouldn't bet on it.

17:32.320 --> 17:36.560
Of course, at the same time, I would like to see a new 2D Metroid, so maybe this is

17:36.560 --> 17:41.440
the end of Metroid Prime, but maybe there will be a new Metroid series, like, you know,

17:41.440 --> 17:46.360
there was Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero, you know, maybe a new Metroid series.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.720
This is the end of Prime, the beginning of something new, I hope.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.560
I want old school Metroid.

17:50.560 --> 17:55.960
I do too, and I think a lot of people want that, but, I don't know, is it really something

17:55.960 --> 18:01.240
that might sell, or something we're not, or something we would get not on the DS?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.240
You know what I mean?

18:02.240 --> 18:04.120
Even more though, will it blend?

18:04.120 --> 18:07.840
I think if a new 2D Metroid's going to come out, it's just going to be on the DS, and

18:07.840 --> 18:11.360
that's kind of the bummer about it, is that, you know, yeah, I like the DS and all, but

18:11.360 --> 18:16.640
I like to play the old school games on my TV as well, the big surround sound, you know,

18:16.640 --> 18:21.520
look at some of the games that are 2D, 3D hybrids that were on consoles that were pretty

18:21.520 --> 18:22.520
good.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.840
Well, Street Fighter IV is a perfect example, right?

18:24.840 --> 18:27.680
2D Fighter, awesome use of 3D in it.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.680
Yeah.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.920
Why couldn't you make a platformer in that kind of vein?

18:30.920 --> 18:31.920
Or a game going back a little bit?

18:31.920 --> 18:35.680
Well, that's what we really got for platformers, and I think LittleBigPlanet.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.680
That's a great example.

18:36.680 --> 18:40.560
I was going to say Beautiful Joe, even though that's back on the GameCube, but still, you

18:40.560 --> 18:42.520
know, a good example of, you know, 2D platformers.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.680
And Shinagogo.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.160
They can still be a lot of fun.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.160
Yeah.

18:46.160 --> 18:51.040
Well, if anything, I think that LittleBigPlanet proved that, like, right away.

18:51.040 --> 18:56.680
Reenie says in chat, Metroid Prime 4, you lost your power-ups again, moron.

18:56.680 --> 18:57.680
I guess that's true.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.960
How many times can we go through the same story of, whoops, lost my power-ups.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.920
Maybe we can use dumb blonde as an excuse.

19:01.920 --> 19:02.920
I don't know.

19:02.920 --> 19:03.920
Yeah, just make it a prequel.

19:03.920 --> 19:04.920
Make it another prequel.

19:04.920 --> 19:08.680
Tigerclaw says the next one will be called Metroid Prime 4, Electric Boogaloo.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.680
One can hope.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.400
That would only be if, that was what they should have called Metroid Prime 2.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.400
Brad from Pod Culture says Metroid Prime 4, Mission to Moscow.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
Who knows?

19:17.400 --> 19:22.240
If you want to join us and chat live on this Sunday evening, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

19:22.240 --> 19:26.720
Well, this is something that I am going to have to get.

19:26.720 --> 19:34.900
This is on my must-buy-we list, is they're doing a haunted house simulator.

19:34.900 --> 19:39.480
And it is going to be Ju-On, which is The Grudge.

19:39.480 --> 19:44.560
Yes, as in the same movie, and probably not including Sarah Michelle Gellar.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.040
It already came out in Japan a few weeks ago.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.680
It will be localized, hopefully pre-Halloween.

19:50.680 --> 19:55.560
So hopefully we'll be able to see it, but it's actually, um, as being consulted on it

19:55.560 --> 20:02.960
is, um, is Shimizu Takashi, who was the guy who directed, actually, not only the Japanese

20:02.960 --> 20:05.960
version, but he directed the first American one.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.720
The second one is utter shit.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.280
Don't go see it.

20:09.280 --> 20:15.880
Um, but it's basically the, the, you're using the Wiimote as a flashlight on screen and

20:15.880 --> 20:22.280
you go through a warehouse, a mannequin factory, um, a hospital, you know, just basically all

20:22.280 --> 20:26.640
your usual, oh my god, I'm scared places, you know.

20:26.640 --> 20:34.640
Um, but it's supposed to have a twist where you can use your second Wiimote to make in-game

20:34.640 --> 20:37.240
things happen immediately.

20:37.240 --> 20:43.640
In fact, the actual quote from this article, and I have to read this, Rob, is to make in-game

20:43.640 --> 20:48.080
events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.520
I like that, and I, there's a YouTube they're promoting this with that just shows a bunch

20:51.520 --> 20:52.520
of scared people.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.200
Hey, I'm all for scary games that are gonna make me jump out of my seat.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.040
I don't know though, The Grudge, you know, I'm on it.

20:58.040 --> 21:02.240
The first movie was cool, but I've seen the second one, the Japanese movie, I've seen

21:02.240 --> 21:06.960
the, um, the TV movie, uh, Jeff and I were renting movies the other night and they, I

21:06.960 --> 21:11.560
saw The Grudge 3 on DVD and I looked at that and I was like, lol, there's a third one.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.560
Was it American?

21:12.560 --> 21:14.120
Yeah, it was American Grudge 3.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.120
No.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
Yes.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.120
No.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.120
Yes.

21:18.120 --> 21:22.760
Unless it said The Grudge 3, I don't know if it was maybe the Japanese one being marketed

21:22.760 --> 21:24.920
as an American one, I don't know, but it was there.

21:24.920 --> 21:25.920
No.

21:25.920 --> 21:26.920
I crap you not.

21:26.920 --> 21:32.660
Well, I'll have to, the second one's funny cause it's about what's her face doing dirty

21:32.660 --> 21:35.400
things with the main character, it's pretty funny.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.640
Not dirty that way, she's, it's very interesting.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.640
It's very interesting.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.480
Yeah, 2009 direct to video.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.480
It came out.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.480
That is shit.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.400
Stars, uh, Shawnee Smith from the, uh, Saw series is in it.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.400
Oh, whatever.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.840
There it is.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.840
The Grudge 3.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.840
I don't know when this came out.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.200
It came out 12th, 12th of May.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
So it just came out.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.720
It doesn't exist in my universe.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.040
Do you want to hear the plot?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.040
No.

22:00.040 --> 22:04.400
A young Japanese woman who holds the key to stopping the evil spirit of Kayako travels

22:04.400 --> 22:08.040
to the haunted Chicago apartment from the sequel, dot, dot, dot.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.560
I'm not going to read the rest cause you didn't really want to hear it anyway.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.560
Meh.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.800
Cause you recognized it from any of the Japanese ones.

22:13.800 --> 22:18.800
No, it goes still moved to Chicago from Japan to Chicago.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.800
No, all they have to do is just hop on an airplane.

22:23.800 --> 22:32.320
No, the whole, that's someone who completely just knows crap about, you know, hauntings

22:32.320 --> 22:33.320
and anything.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.320
They usually stay localized.

22:36.320 --> 22:39.520
Tiger Claw in chat says they tend to milk those movies by creating crappy direct to

22:39.520 --> 22:40.520
DVD sequels.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.520
Yep.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.520
That's true.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.080
Um, you know, there's a sequel to Donnie Darko that just came out too.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.080
That was direct to video.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.080
I haven't watched that yet.

22:47.080 --> 22:52.440
I want to see it's been actually in writing and production for quite a while now and I

22:52.440 --> 22:53.440
really want to see it.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.880
Well, Jeff rented that and I was, you know, he wanted to watch it, but I was kinda like,

22:56.880 --> 22:58.480
I don't remember the first one well enough.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.960
I haven't seen the first one in like 10 years cause seriously, they're making a sequel to

23:01.960 --> 23:03.840
a movie that's like 10 years old.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.200
So I need to just go watch the first one.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.200
Here's my copy right here.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.200
Really?

23:08.200 --> 23:09.200
Add the director's edition.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.200
Yeah.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
Right.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.640
Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie.

23:12.640 --> 23:18.320
And plus, you know, any movie that Drew Barrymore is going to produce and I love Drew Barrymore.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.000
She would be like my secret girlfriend if I could.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
So yeah.

23:23.000 --> 23:30.340
Um, you know, I, uh, I don't know, I, I I'll go watch if it's really that good, like Jeff

23:30.340 --> 23:33.600
can watch it for me and if it's really that good, I'll, he'll watch it again and I can

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
see it.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.600
Right.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.600
Yep.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
All right.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
Uh, let's see.

23:38.600 --> 23:44.720
What if the ghost wanted some deep dish pizza, but I'm bummed.

23:44.720 --> 23:51.560
I feel like slipping my wrist now I'm bleeding my pain on your face.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.780
That was so Gothic and tragic.

23:53.780 --> 23:54.780
Thank you.

23:54.780 --> 23:59.620
Hey, um, something Nintendo might come after you and slit your wrist and make you a bleed

23:59.620 --> 24:04.440
your pain on their face because Nintendo is pissed about these DS flashcards.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.480
Uh, Loki was talking about it a little bit this week.

24:06.480 --> 24:11.840
Well guess what eBay and Amazon both now have had to stop selling these DS flashcards.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.480
Um, Nintendo is basically, I don't know what they did, but they basically convinced a eBay

24:15.480 --> 24:17.280
and Amazon to stop selling them.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.960
Quote Nintendo is pleased with the cooperation is received from both eBay and Amazon to prevent

24:20.960 --> 24:23.120
the sales of game copying devices.

24:23.120 --> 24:27.560
And that was from Nintendo's global head of anti piracy, Jody dot tree.

24:27.560 --> 24:35.240
In an interview with MCV, um, eBay is actually pulling the auctions on this and Amazon got

24:35.240 --> 24:38.600
a notice and take down and all this fun stuff.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.520
So a good luck though, getting all those mom pause stores that still, still sell this,

24:42.520 --> 24:47.360
but still puts a little dent in it and makes it a little bit harder to get.

24:47.360 --> 24:52.560
If you are looking for these cartridges, um, Rini though, and chat says, flashcards are

24:52.560 --> 24:53.560
a waste of money.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.560
Hi there.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.240
SD card slot on DSI.

24:56.240 --> 24:59.200
Gold anthro admits the Amazon is where he got his are for.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.200
I don't know.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.280
I'm not into the hacking thing.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.280
Like a lot of y'all are.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.820
I don't, I don't really have the patience for that stuff.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.240
So I don't really do it.

25:06.240 --> 25:09.880
Um, but I know this is probably a loss to those that were looking forward to the home

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
brew.

25:10.880 --> 25:15.180
If you are using it for piracy though, well then, you know, it's hard to feel a little

25:15.180 --> 25:19.160
pity for you, but at least the home brew and all that, as far as all that goes, that is

25:19.160 --> 25:20.160
kind of a bummer.

25:20.160 --> 25:24.400
So, all right, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

25:24.400 --> 25:31.000
Well, in other news, we have, uh, some Sega stuff that makes me particularly happy.

25:31.000 --> 25:38.080
Um, going to be coming out, um, for DS and Wii is Jambo Safari, actually.

25:38.080 --> 25:45.240
Um, they are taking the old arcade title and, you know, making it pretty and more modern

25:45.240 --> 25:49.800
looking and having more stuff happen, you know, to make people happy.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.400
Um, there'll be customizable characters and vehicles and you can run a safari park and

25:54.400 --> 25:57.120
help animals in need.

25:57.120 --> 26:01.920
Uh, the DS version, of course, will work with the stylus and the Wii version will have a

26:01.920 --> 26:08.760
lasso gameplay that uses the Wiimote and it's a, you can have a two player and four player

26:08.760 --> 26:12.400
party version, so there will be more.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.440
This is just proof that OLR has friends in high places somewhere, even though they're

26:16.440 --> 26:20.560
not admitting who they are, seriously, who would have thought that Jambo fucking Safari

26:20.560 --> 26:21.720
will get a remake.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.200
This is the best news of the year so far, really.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.800
I am so all about this game.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.200
I just really hope it doesn't suck, but I don't know, Sega's got a pretty good track

26:31.200 --> 26:32.600
record with the remakes.

26:32.600 --> 26:36.960
I'm looking past Sonic because Sonics were like reinventions, but, uh, you know, Sega's

26:36.960 --> 26:40.280
got a pretty good track record otherwise, so I'm really excited about Jambo Safari.

26:40.280 --> 26:43.040
I don't know about you, DarkSakura, are you looking forward to this?

26:43.040 --> 26:45.800
Yeah, pretty much, I like to play the game.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.480
I still want my freaking Planet Harrier, do you hear me, Sega?

26:49.480 --> 26:50.480
Whores.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.980
I mean, I love you.

26:52.980 --> 26:56.400
So I'm excited, I'm hoping that this announcement came out because this is one of the things

26:56.400 --> 26:58.520
that's going to be playable at E3, do you think?

26:58.520 --> 26:59.520
You think, you think, you think?

26:59.520 --> 27:00.520
I hope.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
I won't be there.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.520
I know, but I will bring you-

27:02.520 --> 27:04.120
I'm trying not to speculate on-

27:04.120 --> 27:08.320
Maybe they'll have a Jambo keychain I can bring back for you, see?

27:08.320 --> 27:09.320
There you go.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.320
That'll be worthwhile.

27:10.320 --> 27:11.320
Exactly, exactly.

27:11.320 --> 27:16.320
Well, hey, we don't know much about Jambo Safari yet, hopefully a little more after

27:16.320 --> 27:19.480
E3, but we do know about some of the games that are coming out this week.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.800
Let's travel around the world and look at this week's release dates.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.640
I'm going to start with the US, sadly Loki is not here to do US release dates, but I'll

27:25.640 --> 27:26.960
fill in for him tonight.

27:26.960 --> 27:31.920
On the Nintendo DS this week, Jake Hunter Detective Story, Memories of the Past, Johnny

27:31.920 --> 27:37.520
Bravo, Datorama, a couple games with the preface of Crazy Chicken, including Star Carts, Pharaoh's

Treasure, Imagine Boutique Owner comes out this week as well, as well as Space Camp,

27:42.720 --> 27:45.800
which I thought I remembered Loki reading a couple weeks ago, so I don't know if this

27:45.800 --> 27:47.560
game was pushed back or what.

27:47.560 --> 27:51.880
Sadly no, it is not based on the great 80s movie with the same name, so don't get your

27:51.880 --> 27:52.880
hopes up.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.240
On the personal trainer, Walking, also on the DS this week.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.240

On the PC, Hinterland, Orc Lords, Age of Pirate 2, City of Abandoned Ships, Dragon

28:08.840 --> 28:14.960
Sky, Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper, damnation is another game that comes out on the PC this

week.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.880

and on the Xbox 360, Damnation as well as Wallace and Gromit 2, Wallace and Gromit Episode

28:37.960 --> 28:42.220
2, The Last Resort, which I believe is a Xbox Live game.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.760
That is all that's coming out in the US this week, let's travel over to the UK, Dark Soccer.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.560
For the UK on PS2 we have Secret Agent Clank.

28:48.560 --> 28:54.800
On the 28th we have Inferno Pool and Saints Row 2 Corporate Warfare, and Trash Panic,

28:54.800 --> 29:05.040
whatever that is, we have Artanelico, Two Melody of Metafalka, I guess, if I can, Falisa,

29:05.040 --> 29:06.040
I guess?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.040
I can't read it.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.040
My brain doesn't work.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.680
Is Trash Panic what my mother does when I leave a Coke can on the table because I forgot

29:11.680 --> 29:14.480
to throw it away or what have you, or got lazy and just walked away?

29:14.480 --> 29:15.480
That sounds like what it is.

29:15.480 --> 29:16.480
Maybe.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.480
Trash Panic.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.480
Don't worry, mama will clean it.

29:18.480 --> 29:24.200
On the 29th, Boom Blocks Bash Party, Brain Exercise with Dr. Kaleishima, and Fuel and

29:33.360 --> 29:40.160
Looking at the Japanese release dates on the Xbox 360 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Empires

29:40.160 --> 29:44.920
comes out in both Japan and the general Asian regions.

29:44.920 --> 29:50.960
This is Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires, basically, is what this is, your version of that.

29:50.960 --> 29:56.560
Coming out in other places, I'm sorry, coming out on other consoles in the same place, Infamous

29:56.560 --> 30:00.520
comes out in Asian regions, but it's not quite out in Japan this week.

30:00.520 --> 30:06.360
However, Shin Sangoku Musou 5 comes out as well on the Playstation 3, and Agra Senki comes

30:06.360 --> 30:11.600
out with a price reduction this week, down to $44.90.

30:11.600 --> 30:15.960
Also a game called The Last Guy comes out from Sony computers themselves.

30:15.960 --> 30:20.440
I am not sure, this is an action game, I'm not sure what this is a port of, but it looks

30:20.440 --> 30:23.680
to be some type of shooter game, but what's kind of cool about it, it looks like it uses

30:23.680 --> 30:24.680
Google Earth.

30:24.680 --> 30:28.560
Like, seriously, doesn't the backgrounds here look like something you'd see in Google Earth?

30:28.560 --> 30:29.560
Yeah, a bit.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.560
That's kind of cool about it.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.560
That's pretty cool.

30:31.560 --> 30:32.560
Yeah.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.560
So that comes out this week.

30:33.560 --> 30:37.360
And looking on other consoles, going over to the Nintendo Wii, just one release this

30:37.360 --> 30:45.360
week, Ogon no Kizuna comes out this week, which is not a game I've heard of.

30:45.360 --> 30:52.260
It looks kind of similar to a Dynasty Warriors-ish type of game, but with a little more role-playing

30:52.260 --> 30:55.620
elements mixed in, so check that out if you'd like.

30:55.620 --> 30:59.640
On the Playstation 2, the Grand Theft Auto games get a price reduction this week, that's

30:59.640 --> 31:01.180
something I look forward to in Japan.

31:01.180 --> 31:07.180
On the Nintendo DS, Claymore, Gengan no Majo comes out this week, as well as Days of Memories

31:07.180 --> 31:14.100
3 from SNK, Gaya Kukuten Kenji comes out as well, has a premium edition release as well

31:14.100 --> 31:17.560
from Capcom, oh, you know what that is?

31:17.560 --> 31:20.180
That's Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.

31:20.180 --> 31:24.040
You know what, Rob, I do have to say that your Japanese is improving greatly.

31:24.040 --> 31:27.600
At least this show's been good for something, huh?

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
Yeah.

31:28.600 --> 31:35.880
Also, on the Nintendo DS, one more release for you from Sega, Suzumiya Haruhi no Shokurietsu.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.200
It's a melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.200
That's what it is.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.880
It's maids, is what this looks to be.

31:41.880 --> 31:48.120
No, it's their school club, and Haruhi actually has a really good time dressing up the really

31:48.120 --> 31:52.320
pretty girl up in bunny suits and different things to get stuff done for their club.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.280
Well, there you go, bunny suit, to your heart's content this week.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.280
They're school girls.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.280
Because Haruhi is God.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.040
No, actually, she is.

32:01.040 --> 32:02.520
That's the premise of the story, she's God.

32:02.520 --> 32:08.640
Quickly looking at the PSP release dates, Ghost in the Shell, oh, these are all movies.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.840
I don't see any games this week.

32:11.840 --> 32:16.920
Bamboo Blade is the only game it looks to be this week, so check that out if you'd like.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.920
There you go, that's it for Japanese release dates.

32:18.920 --> 32:23.580
Let's go back into some gaming news and talk about some music that's been licensed for

32:23.580 --> 32:25.920
an upcoming Q Entertainment game.

32:25.920 --> 32:30.960
Kind of interesting about this, apparently, Tiesto and BT songs have been licensed for

32:30.960 --> 32:33.240
this new game from Q Entertainment.

32:33.240 --> 32:39.400
The game is called QJ, based on some, I guess some folks have been digging around some of

32:39.400 --> 32:44.760
the licensing information sites, the songs that were licensed.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.440
Love Comes Again from Tiesto.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.440
So there you go.

32:49.440 --> 32:54.400
I don't know much about this, but if it's Q Entertainment, then it's Mizuguchi, and

32:54.400 --> 32:56.120
I love him.

32:56.120 --> 33:00.000
There's very few games he's put out that I haven't liked, and I'm even counting 99 Nights.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.240
I forgave that game's shortcomings, just because I'm a whore for Tetsuya Mizuguchi games.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.420
So there you go.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.600
More about this game, hopefully at E3, hopefully.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.600
Fingers crossed.

33:10.600 --> 33:15.840
Well, what we have for the PlayStation Network is we do have some updates.

33:15.840 --> 33:21.480
We have some demos of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, Killzone 2, Bullet

33:21.480 --> 33:26.720
4D Interactive AD, whatever, Red Faction, Guerrilla, Multiplayer, and Infamous, which

33:26.720 --> 33:27.720
I sold a commercial for today.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.600
I was like, dude, is this Comic Zone?

33:30.600 --> 33:36.160
PS3 game content, Riddick Dark Athena Premium Multiplayer Pack.

33:36.160 --> 33:40.960
We've got some more for Fear 2, Tom Clancy's Hawks, Pain, Modistore Pacific Rift, Little

33:40.960 --> 33:43.360
Big Planet, a bunch of stuff for Little Big Planet.

33:43.360 --> 33:48.000
Guitar Hero World Tour, the European track, Rock Band Alice Cooper Pack.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
That's cool.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.320
Rock Band Taking Back Sunday, and Kids Don't Follow by the Replacements.

33:54.320 --> 34:01.960
For PSP games, we have Fading Shadows and Creatures Raised in Space.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.720
Creatures Raised in Space?

34:03.720 --> 34:04.720
Amazing.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.280
I actually logged into Home this week.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.440
That's one other game, quote unquote, I played.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.640
Boy, that, Home is really expanding.

34:11.640 --> 34:17.300
Say what you will about, you know, whether Home is a game or any fun, all with quotes,

34:17.300 --> 34:20.760
but they're sure pouring a lot of expansions into it, which I guess is kind of cool.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.720
It seems like you have a lot of new stuff to explore if you haven't used it in a while.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.520
So props to them for that.

34:25.520 --> 34:29.860
Like there's a new like area that you can go to where I guess they're going to do like

34:29.860 --> 34:32.160
announcements inside Home.

34:32.160 --> 34:35.440
Like there's a big giant screen in there, but it has like this weird jungle theme to

34:35.440 --> 34:36.440
it.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.440
I don't know.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.440
I thought it was kind of interesting.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.440
So we'll see.

34:39.440 --> 34:44.040
Before I get to the next story, this chat comment made me lol.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.420
Renee asks, Sky, here's a question.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.480
Is Cooking Mama a MILF?

34:48.480 --> 34:51.540
Please answer very important.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.600
Is Cooking Mama a MILF?

34:53.600 --> 34:54.600
Lord, no.

34:54.600 --> 34:55.600
Yeah.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.600
I unfortunately would have to say no.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.600
She's too prudish.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.600
That's why she's in the kitchen.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.320
She's always in the kitchen and never in the bedroom.

35:00.320 --> 35:05.240
Here you go, ba-dum-bum.

35:05.240 --> 35:11.120
Moving on with some more news, talking about Sony and, well, it looks like Sony is going

35:11.120 --> 35:15.360
to be threatening to sue companies that are publishing images of the PS3.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.680
Remember we were talking about this last week?

35:17.680 --> 35:20.360
We had some images leak out of the new PS3.

35:20.360 --> 35:24.840
Well, apparently, Sony has been demanding that these companies stop doing this.

35:24.840 --> 35:28.440
I know this all started from, I guess, their Taiwanese branch or something.

35:28.440 --> 35:33.960
But dude, when you've threatened to sue, doesn't it kind of prove that the story is true?

35:33.960 --> 35:37.680
That was my first thought, is like, well, way to give it away, right?

35:37.680 --> 35:42.400
I mean, otherwise, wouldn't they just release that good old-fashioned line of, oh, Sony

35:42.400 --> 35:46.080
will not comment on rumors and speculation at this time.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.560
Look for our E3 speech.

35:48.560 --> 35:52.800
But if you stick the lawyers on them, doesn't it kind of prove it to be true?

35:52.800 --> 35:54.800
Maybe I'm crazy.

35:54.800 --> 36:01.600
Well, how about some, I guess, happier news?

36:01.600 --> 36:10.480
We are actually going to be getting some PlayStation 1 classic games for the PS1 Classic Store.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.880
We have been getting information from the ESRB because you know how they love sleek

36:14.880 --> 36:20.440
stuff and five games are supposed to be coming to the online service.

36:20.440 --> 36:26.800
We have, among them, Resident Evil Director's Cut and Metal Gear Solid.

36:26.800 --> 36:33.320
Also among those rated is Special Ops Covert Assault and Ranger Elite and Tom Clancy's

36:33.320 --> 36:34.520
Rainbow Six.

36:34.520 --> 36:35.960
So that's pretty cool.

36:35.960 --> 36:41.760
But dude, Metal freaking Gear and Resident Evil Director's Cut, I will have to go along

36:41.760 --> 36:46.120
with all the bad voice acting because I can quote that game, you know.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.120
What is it?

36:47.120 --> 36:52.080
I hope this is not Chris's blood.

36:52.080 --> 36:57.480
Maybe the hidden porn chat will be kind of embedded in the game somewhere.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
Who knows?

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
Because remember that?

36:59.480 --> 37:01.480
There's YouTube out there where they mix and match all the dialogue into something disgusting.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.480
You know what that was?

37:02.480 --> 37:04.220
I'm going to tell you this because I know how you can do it.

37:04.220 --> 37:10.680
There was a file reader that let you read the audio and video files off of PlayStation

37:10.680 --> 37:15.200
games, because I don't know if you remember, back in the day, the first MP3s out for Bus

37:15.200 --> 37:16.200
to Move 2.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.480
Sorry, I did those.

37:18.480 --> 37:22.600
You know, on my old website, I was the first person that I saw that I noticed that had

37:22.600 --> 37:27.240
them online right after the game came out.

37:27.240 --> 37:34.320
But there's a little reader program that you can get to pull, to rip the files off and

37:34.320 --> 37:39.000
then just record them, you know, convert them to WAV or whatever and record them or whatever.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.800
So that's actually how they pulled this off.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.960
That's also how they got the thing about Maria in Castlevania, where an ending they didn't

37:44.960 --> 37:49.840
put into the game of her actually being taken over by the succubus.

37:49.840 --> 37:55.040
So you can find out it was a lot easier to find stuff on the old readers.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.720
Apparently it sounds like that way.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.760
So what does somebody just kind of dump all the dialogue and then edit it together?

38:00.760 --> 38:06.860
I mean, that's pretty impressive, but you could also kind of like, you could dump the

38:06.860 --> 38:11.000
audio like we used to do this, like to get some of the DDR songs off the home versions

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
of the game.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
That was only when they were mixing audio.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.280
Right, but no, I'm saying after that, we used to rip them by hooking them through the mixing

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
board.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.280
I'm surprised people didn't do that.

38:19.280 --> 38:25.920
Yeah, there was, you could still also pull them off doing the, was it, it wasn't RA,

38:25.920 --> 38:31.360
it was like SX or SA reader or something?

38:31.360 --> 38:32.360
I don't remember.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.920
But yeah, I used to do that back in the day.

38:33.920 --> 38:37.040
This was really easy to do those.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.040
Hmm.

38:38.040 --> 38:43.360
All right, well, apparently there's a lot of rumbling going on about what's going on

38:43.360 --> 38:49.080
at E3 and possibly a new version of Metal Gear Solid apparently being rumored right

38:49.080 --> 38:50.080
now.

38:50.080 --> 38:54.000
And a lot of this has to do with the teaser graphic that showed up on the Kojima Productions

38:54.000 --> 38:57.040
website.

38:57.040 --> 39:01.920
Apparently what's going on is that something is being listed in next week's Famitsu that

39:01.920 --> 39:07.160
the PSP and the PS3 apparently is indicating a new Metal Gear is going to be coming out.

39:07.160 --> 39:12.240
Now, is that Metal Gear Solid 5 or some other type of Metal Gear game in the same vein?

39:12.240 --> 39:13.240
Who knows?

39:13.240 --> 39:16.840
But some rumors about the teaser graphic is that the outline was actually showing a 5.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.200
I'm actually kind of surprised.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.360
I saw that too.

39:19.360 --> 39:23.400
Yeah, I'm surprised if this is Metal Gear Solid 5 because it seems kind of soon.

39:23.400 --> 39:27.320
Is it just me or does it seem like 4 hasn't really been out long enough?

39:27.320 --> 39:29.680
Am I crazy?

39:29.680 --> 39:31.880
I don't know.

39:31.880 --> 39:37.240
But you know, between the magazine, Famitsu magazine, E3 coming up next week with this

39:37.240 --> 39:41.480
countdown seems to be pointing to, and all this, I mean, if there's a time to make a

39:41.480 --> 39:44.960
big announcement, I suppose this will be it.

39:44.960 --> 39:50.440
But you know, I don't know, it just seems too soon for Metal Gear Solid 5.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.240
Another type of Metal Gear Solid game?

39:53.240 --> 39:57.440
Like a new online one or, you know, I don't know, even heck, a new acid game is just coming

39:57.440 --> 39:59.840
to PSP as well?

39:59.840 --> 40:01.840
I don't know.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.560
Is there anything you're hoping it is, Dark Sakura?

40:03.560 --> 40:04.560
I don't know.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.800
Do you think, is it just me or does it seem too soon for 5?

40:07.800 --> 40:08.800
I don't know.

40:08.800 --> 40:09.800
I don't know.

40:09.800 --> 40:14.400
Because you know how while the market is, you know, struck while the iron's hot, pretty

40:14.400 --> 40:15.400
much?

40:15.400 --> 40:17.520
I really don't want to put any speculation on it.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.000
I really don't.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.240
Because I build myself way too much up to be too excited about something.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.720
I want to wait for something a little bit more concrete before I make my judgment.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.880
Comment from your chat room, chat.orangelandraday.com.

40:28.880 --> 40:32.960
ActDeaf says, the countdown is a countdown for a countdown for a countdown for a countdown.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.640
Yeah, I'm getting kind of sick of that crap too.

40:35.640 --> 40:36.640
You know what I mean?

40:36.640 --> 40:37.640
Just announce it.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.040
Announce it or don't.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.380
One countdown to a big announcement might be okay.

40:42.380 --> 40:45.780
But counting down to another countdown is stupid.

40:45.780 --> 40:48.600
Very stupid.

40:48.600 --> 40:53.120
One Night Stands in Chat says, was the 5 outline a definite 5 or could it have been an S?

40:53.120 --> 40:54.120
Very good comment.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.040
Some people are speculating it might have been an S. So maybe it's a new like Metal

40:57.040 --> 41:00.160
Gear Solid S type game or something.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.200
Let me look at it for a second.

41:02.200 --> 41:08.900
It was kind of like, well it's one of those like fonts where it's very like pixelated.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.960
So it could be a 5 or an S. Very easy.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.340
Let me have a look if it loads.

41:15.340 --> 41:16.340
It's not loading.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.340
My computer is being a butthole.

41:17.340 --> 41:18.340
Trust me.

41:18.340 --> 41:20.840
It could be either one.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.840
Let's see.

41:22.840 --> 41:27.020
Other comments, Alpha Cananagram in Chat says, it's just an announcement.

41:27.020 --> 41:28.020
Which is true.

41:28.020 --> 41:29.020
It's only an announcement.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.960
It's not something we should get too excited about.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.920
So there you go.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.840
Well how about something that might be worth getting excited about.

41:36.840 --> 41:42.240
I mean if you don't have iTunes or an iPhone I guess.

41:42.240 --> 41:46.440
PSP and maybe having a music download service.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.280
Sony's been thinking about it.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.960
They released a survey in January to check for consumer interest.

41:51.960 --> 41:59.320
So it seems that they are considering on having other recording companies work with them.

41:59.320 --> 42:02.880
And Sony, they have their own music division.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.780
But they're just thinking about it right now.

42:05.780 --> 42:10.480
So they might have a digital music download but maybe not.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.480
It might happen.

42:11.480 --> 42:12.480
They're thinking about it.

42:12.480 --> 42:15.760
They're sending their little slimy tentacles out to feel for it.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.200
I'm kind of surprised it's one of those things they haven't been thinking about for quite

42:18.200 --> 42:19.200
some time.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.200
You know what I mean?

42:20.200 --> 42:21.200
Like I don't know.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.320
A lot of, again I use the whole college kid thing.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.200
Who do PSP's sell best to?

42:26.200 --> 42:27.200
College kids.

42:27.200 --> 42:31.720
To replace iPods because they do everything else like games and the internet and all this.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.720
So it kind of seems like one of those things that I'm surprised they didn't do this a long

42:34.720 --> 42:36.480
freaking time ago.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.320
Especially when you consider the fact, what else does Sony have?

42:39.320 --> 42:42.560
A big music label, right?

42:42.560 --> 42:44.800
So why is this taking so long?

42:44.800 --> 42:52.560
Sony's got a big, they're big stinky tentacle fingers in the music industry so why not?

42:52.560 --> 42:56.280
I just think though that they tend to behave a bit conservatively when they don't need

42:56.280 --> 42:57.440
to.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.680
Have you noticed that?

42:58.680 --> 43:00.840
Eh, I guess a little bit.

43:00.840 --> 43:04.400
They'll venture out into something that they think is innovative and new but with something

43:04.400 --> 43:06.760
that they see as tried and true.

43:06.760 --> 43:10.040
They're like, ehhh, I don't wanna.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.040
They're doing it.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.040
I don't wanna.

43:12.040 --> 43:20.120
Alpha Canonogram in chat says, Sky they did, it was called Connect, the ATRAC Atorac 3

43:20.120 --> 43:21.760
store which closed down.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.200
They were planning on doing it.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.200
Hmm, interesting.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.200
I don't remember that.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.480
Was that something for just the PSP specifically?

43:27.480 --> 43:31.200
Or was that something to, you know, there were like a million people that were gonna

43:31.200 --> 43:35.120
launch something to compete with iTunes and very few of them succeeded.

43:35.120 --> 43:38.360
I mean you could say that Napster somewhat succeeded because it's a different business

43:38.360 --> 43:39.360
model.

43:39.360 --> 43:45.280
I think the biggest competition for iTunes has probably been, what, Amazon.com maybe?

43:45.280 --> 43:49.200
But I mean, what else is out there that's successfully competed with iTunes?

43:49.200 --> 43:54.240
And when I say successfully, carries a market share even one tenth the size of what Apple

43:54.240 --> 43:55.240
has.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.240
No.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.240
No one.

43:57.240 --> 43:58.240
It's practically a monopoly on Apple's part.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.240
Yeah, so and that's what they're kind of saying there in chat.

44:00.240 --> 44:05.060
So is this something new that maybe is trying to launch and Alpha Canonogram confirms Connect

44:05.060 --> 44:06.060
with Sony's iTunes.

44:06.060 --> 44:09.320
Okay, well a million people tried to launch something to compete with iTunes and they

44:09.320 --> 44:11.600
all failed because none of them stood out.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.240
It was too much competition amongst each other and iTunes already had the, you know, they

44:15.240 --> 44:20.140
had the player to go with the store.

44:20.140 --> 44:23.920
But also, oh I want to read this comment from Marissa Congusto in chat.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.100
Yes, that's right, it's Marissa.

44:26.100 --> 44:29.280
My dad thought he was doing me a big favor getting me a mini disc player instead of an

44:29.280 --> 44:31.980
iPod ages ago, facepalm.

44:31.980 --> 44:32.980
That's alright.

44:32.980 --> 44:33.980
I feel your pain.

44:33.980 --> 44:34.980
I want a mini disc player.

44:34.980 --> 44:35.980
I have an HD DVD player.

44:35.980 --> 44:40.520
I actually want a mini disc player pretty badly, they do some good things with mini

44:40.520 --> 44:41.520
discs.

44:41.520 --> 44:42.520
Really?

44:42.520 --> 44:44.800
It's still, I think somewhat supported in Japan.

44:44.800 --> 44:45.800
Huh.

44:45.800 --> 44:46.800
Weird.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.440
But you know, it's another example where Sony's tried to go, huh, we're going to do all this

44:50.440 --> 44:51.440
new stuff.

44:51.440 --> 44:57.240
I mean, Betamax, Betamax was better, mini disc was great, but the first thing that they've

44:57.240 --> 45:00.860
done in a long time that really caught on, I think like that was Blu-ray.

45:00.860 --> 45:04.240
One Night Stands in Chat asks, wasn't Zune a competitor for iTunes?

45:04.240 --> 45:09.240
Zune was a competitor for the iPod, and certainly Microsoft launched their own store to go with

45:09.240 --> 45:14.560
it, but it didn't really go, you know, one could argue with me whether it was successful

45:14.560 --> 45:18.640
or not, but I think it's pretty clear iTunes has by far the most dominant share.

45:18.640 --> 45:19.640
You know what I mean?

45:19.640 --> 45:22.260
Like it hasn't really put a blip on the radar of what iTunes has.

45:22.260 --> 45:26.360
So whether they're still supporting that whole Microsoft marketplace or what, I don't know.

45:26.360 --> 45:28.160
But we'll see.

45:28.160 --> 45:31.760
Well how about some happy, happy, happy news?

45:31.760 --> 45:34.720
Just a moment, let me talk about this PSP rental service here real quick.

45:34.720 --> 45:39.680
There was a PSP survey that was hinting that a rental service might be on its way to the

45:39.680 --> 45:44.760
PSP, which is kind of interesting because we know that the PSP, you know, there's this

45:44.760 --> 45:49.360
new PSP coming out that nobody's confirming, but we all know it's probably happening, it's

45:49.360 --> 45:55.060
going to be announced at E3 this year, that's a discless PSP.

45:55.060 --> 45:58.040
It's kind of interesting, one thing they're thinking about doing is a rental service,

45:58.040 --> 46:03.000
and this is something that I guess was hinted at by a survey that came out recently that

46:03.000 --> 46:06.920
Sony's doing to market to see the potential for a rental service.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.240
Wouldn't that be interesting?

46:08.240 --> 46:15.660
I don't think we've ever seen anything like this in the years of video gaming, where instead

46:15.660 --> 46:21.560
of a company boo-hooing and yelling and bitching and screaming about blockbusters and Hollywood

46:21.560 --> 46:26.960
videos and places that rent video games and how they chip into game sales, a company deciding

46:26.960 --> 46:30.560
to, well hell, we'll do game rentals of our own.

46:30.560 --> 46:35.040
If you can't beat them, join them, and we'll compete with them directly.

46:35.040 --> 46:40.120
Very interesting, if this actually happens, that could be kind of interesting, I mean

46:40.120 --> 46:41.120
why not?

46:41.120 --> 46:46.960
Apple has proved that it can happen with the movies on iTunes, why not rent games through

46:46.960 --> 46:47.980
a similar service?

46:47.980 --> 46:51.320
This could be big if it's true, you know, it's all kind of a big grain of salt right

46:51.320 --> 46:54.560
now because a survey isn't the official word, but it could be very interesting.

46:54.560 --> 46:57.200
Well, it could be.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.720
Alright, that's all I had.

46:59.720 --> 47:01.920
Well, I did have my happy news.

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
Sure!

47:02.920 --> 47:05.080
It has been confirmed!

47:05.080 --> 47:09.200
We are getting Tatsunoko vs Capcom in the US.

47:09.200 --> 47:18.260
The Nintendo power scan was true, and Capcom said on their Twitter that Tatsunoko vs Capcom

47:18.260 --> 47:27.120
is being localized for a US release, well US, Canada, North America, whatever.

47:27.120 --> 47:32.440
And the quote says, Cat is officially out of the bag on Capcom Mystery Game number 1

47:32.440 --> 47:34.480
and linked to the scan.

47:34.480 --> 47:40.040
And then there was also one made by Capcom Unity on their blog.

47:40.040 --> 47:45.480
But there's one more mystery game they should be having at E3, so I hope it doesn't suck.

47:45.480 --> 47:50.160
That Arinean chat is yelling out with online and bug fixes, god I hope that's true.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.800
Why not, especially if it's true they have to cut back a few characters, well then hell,

47:53.800 --> 47:54.800
let's make it better!

47:54.800 --> 47:57.360
But the characters that were listed on there aren't even in the damn game anyway.

47:57.360 --> 48:02.040
Oh, oh yeah, we had some back and forth last week on whether those characters were really

48:02.040 --> 48:03.040
going to be there or not.

48:03.040 --> 48:07.520
The only gachamon characters that were in the game is Ken and June.

48:07.520 --> 48:08.520
Joe wasn't in it.

48:08.520 --> 48:12.640
If Joe was in it, I'd be screaming, because I'd want him in the release.

48:12.640 --> 48:20.920
Arinean chat says, Sky mystery game number 2 is Mega Man Legends 3 on Wii.

48:20.920 --> 48:25.920
God I hope you're, if you're lying to me, so help me god, that would be amazing though

48:25.920 --> 48:27.120
if that's the mystery game.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.080
I would love that.

48:29.080 --> 48:32.320
But it seems like it's all speculation to me.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.440
We'll see.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.240
By the way, we were talking about the Zune earlier, and we actually have some news about

48:36.240 --> 48:40.880
the Zune, including some leaked images of what is supposed to be the Zune X, which I

48:40.880 --> 48:45.400
guess you could think of as, you know, Microsoft's little competitor to the iPhone.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.560
We talked about this a little bit last week.

48:47.560 --> 48:51.600
Apparently yeah, some new images have come out, and I guess the best way I could describe

48:51.600 --> 48:55.620
this, since this is radio and I can't really show you the images, is it looks kind of like

48:55.620 --> 48:57.680
a scaled down PSP.

48:57.680 --> 49:01.600
Very rectangular in shape though, not that round shape, and you definitely have the four

49:01.600 --> 49:02.600
buttons there on the side.

49:02.600 --> 49:05.740
It's just four buttons and a crosshair, and it looks like what's, I'm sorry, the cross

49:05.740 --> 49:09.140
pad, and definitely what looks to be some shoulder buttons.

49:09.140 --> 49:11.900
I don't know though, kind of take this with a grain of salt, but if some of this is to

49:11.900 --> 49:13.840
be believed, then this could be pretty cool.

49:13.840 --> 49:19.280
Again, this is supposed to have a micro SD slot, SIM card tray, support for Bluetooth

49:19.280 --> 49:22.840
headphones in it, some optical digital output in there as well.

49:22.840 --> 49:28.640
Apparently it will actually work with Zune X originals, Xbox Live and on live ready game

49:28.640 --> 49:29.640
streaming.

49:29.640 --> 49:34.360
There'll be a 32 gigabyte flash drive, and the battery is built in and rechargeable.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.360
And it will bake scones.

49:36.360 --> 49:38.060
It just well might.

49:38.060 --> 49:39.060
And run Linux.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.060
So we'll see.

49:40.060 --> 49:42.280
Maybe there will be more info about this at E3.

49:42.280 --> 49:46.040
I dare whoever gets one of these to put Linux on it.

49:46.040 --> 49:48.400
That'll make me go squee for a little bit.

49:48.400 --> 49:52.480
Well, this is something that probably won't make people squee, although to be completely

49:52.480 --> 49:56.000
honest, I don't think anyone will really freaking give a damn.

49:56.000 --> 50:03.400
Watchmen The End is Nigh, the second episode of it is not coming out for PC, and sad trombone

50:03.400 --> 50:04.440
I guess.

50:04.440 --> 50:13.400
It will come out on Xbox 360 and PS3, but of course it's also going to be selling like

50:13.400 --> 50:20.200
a special edition that has this and the first episode on it.

50:20.200 --> 50:24.000
Warner is doing the Watchmen The End is Nigh Complete Experience.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.600
It has the PS3 versions and the director's cut of the film on Blu-ray.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.560
So maybe that'll be worth buying, because the movie was freaking good, but meh, the

50:32.560 --> 50:37.080
rest of it, meh, who cares?

50:37.080 --> 50:38.880
I can fart better games.

50:38.880 --> 50:44.200
Well, somebody out there might care, you don't know.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.000
Maybe.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.920
Question in the chat room that I kind of like, and this is a very unpronounceable name and

50:48.920 --> 50:56.500
I'm sorry, but rlbx327 asks, how would the new PSP work if a person does not have an

50:56.500 --> 50:57.500
internet connection?

50:57.500 --> 50:59.080
How would that work?

50:59.080 --> 51:02.000
That's a great question, one that we'd all like to know the answer to as well, I'm hoping

51:02.000 --> 51:03.840
we'll get some results at E3.

51:03.840 --> 51:08.400
I don't know if maybe you can take it into a game store and buy things that way, but

51:08.400 --> 51:11.560
I guess the assumption is everybody has an internet connection at this point.

51:11.560 --> 51:14.280
It's like the DS download stations, could be something similar?

51:14.280 --> 51:15.280
I guess.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.840
I mean, there's definitely ways around it, but I think they just assume everybody has

51:18.840 --> 51:24.160
an internet connection, and even dial up if you have to, but who has dial up anymore?

51:24.160 --> 51:27.200
I guess, well I shouldn't say that, because there'll be somebody that sends me a message.

51:27.200 --> 51:33.640
Me, I have dial up, my parents have dial up, but geez, my iPod 3G's faster than their internet

51:33.640 --> 51:39.440
at home on dial up, but I guess some areas still aren't wired for broadband, but I guess

51:39.440 --> 51:46.120
you could still use a PSP Go on dial up, but maybe Sony is only marketing to those people

51:46.120 --> 51:47.760
that have internet connections.

51:47.760 --> 51:52.720
I mean, let's face it, a vast portion of the population has an internet connection that's

51:52.720 --> 51:53.720
fast.

51:53.720 --> 51:58.440
If every one of them bought a PSP Go, they would do very well, so why bother catering

51:58.440 --> 52:01.760
to those that don't have an internet connection, right?

52:01.760 --> 52:05.720
Yeah, well, this is the modern world, everyone's supposed to be connected.

52:05.720 --> 52:09.640
Super X-Link in chat has an interesting comment, go to a free Wi-Fi spot.

52:09.640 --> 52:13.280
Remember when, I think it was Nintendo did that at all the McDonalds, the McDonalds or

52:13.280 --> 52:14.280
something like that?

52:14.280 --> 52:20.400
I don't remember, so, anyhow, some more stories involving Capcom, actually, and talking about

52:20.400 --> 52:21.400
E3.

52:21.400 --> 52:26.280
Apparently, it is going around that Capcom of Japan is apparently going to be pulling

52:26.280 --> 52:27.280
out of E3.

52:27.280 --> 52:30.400
Now, this doesn't mean that Capcom is not going to have a booth or anything like that,

52:30.400 --> 52:35.080
it just means that the international travel looks to be pulling out of E3.

52:35.080 --> 52:39.100
This is due to concern over, guess what, swine flu.

52:39.100 --> 52:43.480
That's right, apparently the Japanese branch of the company, they are not committing fully

52:43.480 --> 52:49.800
to attending the E3, they are still contemplating what to do about the swine flu outbreak that's

52:49.800 --> 52:56.360
going on in Keihanshin, which is where Capcom's main office is in Japan.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.620
Very interesting, and what they're already saying is that because of this, Dead Rising

52:59.620 --> 53:01.800
2 is not going to be showing up at E3.

53:01.800 --> 53:06.760
Capcom has confirmed that Dead Rising 2 is not going to be there at E3.

53:06.760 --> 53:11.280
And this has to do with Japanese government restrictions and the advisory in Japan right

53:11.280 --> 53:12.500
now.

53:12.500 --> 53:19.780
By the way, doesn't just end there, Square, Koei, also not attending E3 from their Japanese

53:19.780 --> 53:23.640
branches because of, apparently, swine flu concerns.

53:23.640 --> 53:29.160
A quote from an article on gamepolitics.com, quote, Square Enix has canceled plans for

53:29.160 --> 53:33.460
its Kingdom Hearts team to attend the show, whilst Koei has confirmed that an unspecified

53:33.460 --> 53:37.920
number of its Japanese employees will not be traveling to the event.

53:37.920 --> 53:39.120
That's sad face.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.760
Very, very sad.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.880
And also incredibly freaking stupid.

53:42.880 --> 53:47.060
It is incredibly stupid to still be concerned about the swine flu, my god.

53:47.060 --> 53:49.640
How many people contracted swine flu, like what, 800?

53:49.640 --> 53:50.640
How many people died?

53:50.640 --> 53:51.640
10?

53:51.640 --> 53:54.380
Yeah, maybe 10 at most, but there was a couple, granted there was a couple thousand that got

53:54.380 --> 53:57.360
swine flu, but how many people get regular flu?

53:57.360 --> 53:58.360
All the time!

53:58.360 --> 53:59.840
Fucking shit.

53:59.840 --> 54:05.800
This is a mass hysteria pandemic thing to sell flu masks and get people to think about

54:05.800 --> 54:08.240
something other than the war or something, you know?

54:08.240 --> 54:09.380
It's just stupid.

54:09.380 --> 54:10.380
It's fabricated.

54:10.380 --> 54:11.380
It's fabricated.

54:11.380 --> 54:16.720
There's been outbreaks of swine flu before, and it did just about as much damage.

54:16.720 --> 54:21.280
The only reason it did more damage is because we had less medical technology to deal with

54:21.280 --> 54:22.280
it.

54:22.280 --> 54:23.280
Seriously.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.520
I'm just, ugh.

54:25.520 --> 54:30.320
So the fact that stupid swine flu or H1N1 or whatever the fuck you want to call it is

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
ruining E3.

54:31.320 --> 54:32.320
Fuck people.

54:32.320 --> 54:51.000
I say we dedicate the FUs of the week to this.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.880
My FU of the week goes to just those stupid people who are willing to believe any and

54:55.880 --> 55:01.680
everything that they see on TV, on the internet, you gullible, gullible fucking sheep.

55:01.680 --> 55:03.560
I hope you get swine flu.

55:03.560 --> 55:04.720
Just get it.

55:04.720 --> 55:13.800
I hope you get swine flu of the colon and can do nothing but shit viruses or something.

55:13.800 --> 55:14.800
That's what I wish.

55:14.800 --> 55:17.000
I love you stupid people.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Wow.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Swine.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.960
And also I want Dick Cheney to shut up.

55:22.960 --> 55:25.280
And I just want, I just want people to shut up.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.480
I want people to just shut up.

55:27.480 --> 55:28.480
Stop it.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.480
Knock it the fuck off.

55:30.480 --> 55:33.320
Knock it the fuck off.

55:33.320 --> 55:34.320
Swine flu.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.320
YouTube.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
No, I'm kidding.

55:36.320 --> 55:37.320
No, seriously.

55:37.320 --> 55:42.640
I just want people to think for themselves, to think intelligently.

55:42.640 --> 55:48.640
And really I want all of those networks, especially Fox news, may they burn in hell forever.

55:48.640 --> 55:53.640
I want, I want them to, I want real news on my TV.

55:53.640 --> 55:54.640
I want real news.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.520
I want what's actually going on in the world.

55:56.520 --> 55:59.440
I want to know what's going on outside of America.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.480
Do you hear me CNN?

56:01.480 --> 56:08.200
That's why BBC news, BBC America's news owns yours completely and utterly.

56:08.200 --> 56:09.200
Sorry.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.200
It just does.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.200
And I like CNN.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.800
I like CNN much better than Fox news because Fox news is the, the shit that rats shit.

56:15.800 --> 56:16.800
Okay.

56:16.800 --> 56:23.120
It's like the, the feces of slugs and I hate slugs.

56:23.120 --> 56:24.360
You know, you get more accuracy.

56:24.360 --> 56:26.000
You should have a political talk show.

56:26.000 --> 56:33.120
I have a blog whenever I post on it, but I mean, seriously, it's like, I think it's completely

56:33.120 --> 56:37.920
sad to find out anything that's actually going on in America and in the world.

56:37.920 --> 56:40.440
I have to go to BBC.

56:40.440 --> 56:47.520
It should be CNN or one of the good networks reporting our shit properly.

56:47.520 --> 56:57.360
So a big, big finger to our American media, a big finger to the gullible people who believe

56:57.360 --> 56:58.360
it.

56:58.360 --> 57:07.400
You know, I have a, I have a magnet on my door of my refrigerator that says, um, bless

57:07.400 --> 57:11.080
them to the effect of respect people that seek the truth, doubt those who find it.

57:11.080 --> 57:12.080
Wow.

57:12.080 --> 57:13.960
Can I talk now?

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
Yeah.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.560
Uh, I actually don't have a lot, so that's fine.

57:17.560 --> 57:18.560
You went a little long.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.560
Does not really have anything.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.120
My FU goes to drama.

57:21.120 --> 57:26.940
I just, I'm sick of it and I choose not to be around it, so whatever.

57:26.940 --> 57:29.120
I got better things to do.

57:29.120 --> 57:30.420
That's right.

57:30.420 --> 57:32.120
Better things.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.200
That's it for the FUs of the week.

57:33.200 --> 57:36.840
How about something a little more pleasant, uh, even though this might drive us to some

57:36.840 --> 57:37.840
FUs too.

57:37.840 --> 57:40.640
Apparently our mailbag is quite thin this week and that's very sad.

57:40.640 --> 57:46.160
Uh, mailbag orange laundry.com is the place to send your emails and one of the only dark

57:46.160 --> 57:48.720
soccer will read them as she'll do right now.

57:48.720 --> 57:49.720
What?

57:49.720 --> 57:53.600
We have like one, two, maybe one actually that came in while we were broadcasting cheeseburger.

57:53.600 --> 57:54.600
All right.

57:54.600 --> 57:58.640
Hey guys, I'm curious about your opinions on the new Star Trek movie.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.880
I've seen it three times in a theater.

58:01.880 --> 58:05.720
I'm 15 and I'm obsessed with Star Wars, but I never really saw anything in Star Trek.

58:05.720 --> 58:09.640
I saw the movie two weeks ago with no expectations because I've never experienced anything Star

58:09.640 --> 58:10.640
Trek before.

58:10.640 --> 58:14.080
I was blown away and it was the first movie I had ever gone to where everyone clapped

58:14.080 --> 58:15.080
at the end.

58:15.080 --> 58:17.400
Actually, all three times I saw that people clapped.

58:17.400 --> 58:21.720
Um, I knew I wanted to see it again as I was leaving the theater, which I did yesterday

58:21.720 --> 58:23.120
and plan to again next week.

58:23.120 --> 58:27.780
I plan on buying the old shows and movies on eBay to catch up on some of the older stuff.

58:27.780 --> 58:32.760
I have researched some stuff about the movie and I'd like to say, uh, red shirt guy dies

58:32.760 --> 58:33.760
if you know what that means.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.760
You're awesome.

58:34.760 --> 58:37.600
If you don't go look it up, it's not really a spoiler, just something they threw in from

58:37.600 --> 58:38.600
the old series.

58:38.600 --> 58:39.600
Dude.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.000
I will give you the rule right now.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.280
If you're wearing a red shirt and no one knows who you are, you are going to die.

58:45.280 --> 58:49.640
You know, next generation is yellow, but security officers die.

58:49.640 --> 58:50.640
Red shirt.

58:50.640 --> 58:55.960
In fact, they sell on ThinkGeek a red, a red ringer t-shirt that says expendable on it

58:55.960 --> 58:57.960
in the Star Trek font.

58:57.960 --> 58:58.960
Nice.

58:58.960 --> 59:02.040
Um, I will go ahead and say something and I've said this before.

59:02.040 --> 59:04.440
I was not a Trekkie originally.

59:04.440 --> 59:05.880
I was a Whovian.

59:05.880 --> 59:09.240
I grew up watching Doctor Who on PBS and not watching Star Trek.

59:09.240 --> 59:13.400
Although I've seen a number of the original episodes and almost all of next generation

59:13.400 --> 59:18.400
and maybe a smattering here of DS9 and, uh, you know, Voyager.

59:18.400 --> 59:23.200
And I watched three episodes of Enterprise and decided it was shit, but there are references

59:23.200 --> 59:26.240
to all the other series all throughout the movie.

59:26.240 --> 59:33.200
Like, um, I was just saying, you know, like the scene where they go into, you know, the,

59:33.200 --> 59:38.440
the Delta Vega, you know, place and there's a Tribble just sitting there going, hi, I'm

59:38.440 --> 59:44.600
a Tribble and you know, it's, I actually, you know, I purchased something recently that

59:44.600 --> 59:48.840
was like the best four episodes of Star Trek ever, the original series, and they're great

59:48.840 --> 59:49.840
episodes.

59:49.840 --> 59:54.240
And I want to say, if you want to get a feel for the original series that will give you

59:54.240 --> 59:58.760
a decent smattering of what to expect, just get this.

59:58.760 --> 01:00:06.400
It's four episodes and among them are, um, the, one of them is, uh, Trouble with Tribbles,

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.880
which is supposed to be like the big favorite and I love that episode.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:18.720
And also, um, it's just fantastic, but yeah, go, go get some of those little samples first,

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.400
see how you feel about it.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.280
Um, I like next generation going back and watching a bunch of it though, you're going

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.640
to find it really dated.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.920
The old stuff will hold up because you expect it to be old, but next generation we're talking

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.840
about when I was, you know, early high school, which next generation now, believe it or not,

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.160
is getting to be 20 years old.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.160
Yeah.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.160
Like, Oh boy.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:42.800
But, um, DS9, you know, I didn't watch much of it.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.080
I'm actually going to be going back and watching a bunch of it just because from what I understand

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.400
is probably the best of the series.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.660
Um, Voyager has its ups and downs.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.660
I've seen crap episodes.

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.480
I've seen great episodes and yeah, I'm sorry, Jerry Ryan is hot.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:01:00.480
Um, but Enterprise is like, I keep expecting Scott Bakula to jump.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480
I'm sorry to leap.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.360
Cause he was, you know, from Quantum Leap.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.920
I do want to remind though, Jerry Ryan didn't show up till season four.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920
I know.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920
That's right.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.680
Um, by the way, Star Trek, me personally loved it.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.680
Loved the movie.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.680
Thought it was great.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.920
It was, um, you know, it definitely kind of JJ Abrams definitely said, I am fucking turning

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.600
this car around right the fuck now and taking it a new direction, but it needed it.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.920
It needed it.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.720
I hope we get a new series out of it.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.560
I mean, even if the series isn't related to the movie, I hope it invigorates interest

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:35.200
in Star Trek enough that we do get the Uber nerdy series in the Voyager next generation

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.560
deep space nine cannon.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.840
Like, I want to see a new show like that.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840
That's not enterprise.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:45.080
I actually, I'll tell you what they've confirmed, um, uh, writing on the sequel now and got

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.360
the whole cast.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.360
And I'm, don't get me wrong.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.960
I'm, I'm thrilled about that too, but where's my weekly dose.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.240
You know, I want to see that too.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.480
That would be very exciting.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.040
I don't think I could watch the movie a million times in the theater.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.240
Like dark soccer does.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.520
Maybe I'd see it one more time, but, uh, I'll just buy it on Blu-ray when it comes out.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.760
I think I might do what, uh, dark soccer is suggesting though and get the, uh, uh, episodes

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.760
sampling.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.760
Cause you're right.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.720
I saw those on, uh, what I'm done with it.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.320
I have the one with the four episodes on it.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:15.000
I also want to, I really want the next generation movies on Blu-ray.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.440
No disrespect to the old movies, but I really want the next generation ones.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.640
Cause I went and saw every single one of those in the theater, but I always loved the next

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.640
generation.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.120
Who is your favorite character in all of Star Trek?

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.760
Well, I have to do it by, by season.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760
Sorry.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.720
So original season, um, well in the movie, I'm going to say right now, Scotty, cause

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720
I'm sorry.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.880
I love Simon Pegg between him and Carl Urban.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.320
I'm sorry that that made the movie for me.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.720
His, Carl Urban's McCoy was perfect and oh my God, ah, Southern guy, he just did the

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.720
accent and everything.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.720
Just right.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.720
It made me really happy.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.160
But, but Simon Pegg as Scotty was just like, actually he was probably my favorite in the

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.120
original series too.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.840
Yeah.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.840
Next generation.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.840
It depends.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:07.800
Cause as a kid, I was that age, I was a Wesley fangirl, but getting older, it's all about

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.560
Q. All about Q. I love Q. I love every bit of Q. So I actually have to say Q for Voyager

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:20.560
as well since we've had Q and I think that the seven and the doctor are funny together.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.560
Yeah.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:22.800
The doctor was probably my favorite in Voyager.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:29.800
For DS9, I'd actually have to say, um, Judzia or, um, Worf.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.740
I really liked Odo though.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.920
My favorite was Guinan.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.560
Guinan will always be my favorite.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560
I know.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.560
I love Whoopi.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
What can I say?

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560
All right.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.960
We're, we're being way too, this is a video game show, but I will say this, the fact that

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:46.800
Star Trek is being made into this MMO, please don't suck.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:47.800
Please don't suck.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.080
I'm still making the race the O.L.O.R.I.E.N.D. Please, if there's God out there, do not let

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.100
this game suck because right now, Star Trek is riding such a high, high wave and there

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:04.360
is so much potential, but at the same time, there is so much they could fuck up beyond

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360
all belief.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.920
And I am praying that this game doesn't suck because I will be leaving all my other MMOs

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.920
to play it.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.720
I have to quote Game Guru on this cause honestly, I fully agree with this.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.360
Carl Urbans McCoy makes me wonder if reincarnation exists.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360
Yes.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.680
All right.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.560
Uh, that's it for the mailbag.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.800
If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.120
Hey guys, your calls soon.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.880
Uh, but first we have a little bit of gaming news for you guys and of course the classic

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.880
game of the week.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.960
We haven't forgot that yet, but, uh, one more news story for you guys has to do with Forza

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.560
Motorsport 3.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.520
I think y'all know it's coming.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.480
Y'all know it had to happen and sure enough, the German retail version of amazon.com called

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:56.440
amazon.de has listed Forza Motorsport 3, Prima's official game guide out on September 30th.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.760
Whoops.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.720
Looks like that spilled the beans that Forza Motorsport 3 is coming.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.920
Uh, so that means that game is probably coming out around October.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.640
The guides usually come out a little bit before the games to help raise hype.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.560
Uh, it sounds like the game should come out in Europe in October, which probably is going

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:14.480
to be a worldwide, worldwide release kind of thing.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:21.000
Um, granted it could always be a bug, take it with a grain of salt, but, uh, yep.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
There you go.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.720
Forza Motorsport 3 is coming at some point.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.800
Um, comments and chat.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.400
Why didn't you read my email?

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.800
Because you sent it too late.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.800
Yep.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:31.800
We'll read it next week.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800
All right.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800
Maybe.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800
Maybe.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.800
We'll, uh, go to the email or go to, not the emails, we already went to the emails.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.800
We'll go to the Classic Game of the Week now.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.200
Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer likes to dig through the archives and

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:44.040
find a game she thinks y'all ought to be playing.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.040
So here it is.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.040
Classic Game of the Week.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.800
Classic Game of the Week is beer pong.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:50.800
Awesome.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800
I'm kidding.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.800
It's actually DuckTales.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.800
Woo.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.800
Woo.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Yeah.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.800
Yay.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.480
It's about damn time I picked this one.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.480
I didn't actually put in a gameplay one up because I wanted the music, best music in

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.480
the game.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:28.320
So anyway, it is, of course, based off of the Disney TV show, and it came out of Nintendo

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.320
in 1989.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:35.080
And so you basically go around as Scrooge McDuck, who is going around to collect treasures

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.720
all over the world and the moon.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:42.920
It came out on Game Boy, and it has nothing to do with DuckTales and Quest for Gold.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:51.680
So basically, this is really one of the top Capcom games for the Nintendo.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:59.480
It actually had Tokoru Fujiwara and Yuki-chan's Pop-Up.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.440
You gotta read the credits on some of the old Capcom games.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.440
I love it.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:09.440
It was really tight to play if you used a Scrooge's cane as a weapon and a poco stick

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440
and was non-linear.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:17.520
So basically, you're going around and you're helping NPCs and whacking enemies with a cane

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.240
and telling them to get off your lawn or whatever.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.720
And you can actually play any of the levels in order.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.080
Like I said, non-linear.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:32.320
You have a boss you have to fight at the end of each level, two hidden treasures, there's

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.880
a golden ring in the African mines and a golden mirror in the moon level.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:41.640
And after you've done all that, you go to Transylvania for some reason to do boss fights.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.760
So you can keep going back and unlock different parts of the levels and do different stuff.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:52.320
So you've got basically your DuckTales characters, you have Scrooge, you have Kiwi, Dewi, and

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:58.920
Lily, Webby, Gizmo, Duck, Launchpad, Maquack, Gyro Gearloose, Ms. Beakley, Bubba, Magica

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:06.880
Dispel, who is in Transylvania, Flintheart, Glomgold, and the Beagle Boys.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:12.760
And then you also have an alternate ending in the NES version, where if you finish the

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:23.000
game with ten million dollars and have both of the hidden treasures, then you will have

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.160
the news article come up with Scrooge winning, but he has a crown on his head, and a paper

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.280
stating that he has stunned the world with his discovery of two lost treasures.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.360
So that's pretty cool.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.240
So yeah, it was by Capcom.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:42.160
There was actually a beta version that was out too, and actually we were releasing the

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.920
Consumer's Guide hot tip for Coolest Nintendo's game.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.480
They had different levels, there was the Jungle, Ghost House, Underground, Snow Mountain, and

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.840
Moon Surface.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.320
Hamburgers were your power-ups instead of ice cream.

01:08:53.320 --> 01:09:03.000
The coffins in the Ghost House had crosses on them instead of R.E.P., although if you

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.720
look in the NES Atlas, there are pictures of the original.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:12.440
The Moon music had a slower tempo music, and I've actually heard it, it's actually pretty

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.440
good.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.480
The Ghost House had a different music track, and Gizmo Duck went by Roboduck.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:27.060
In the French version, it was called La Bande a Pichot, so it's the same DuckTales thing.

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:32.720
And there was, the Famicom version was called Wanpaku Daku Yume Boken, which is Naughty Duck's

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:39.480
Dream Adventure, and it didn't have all the censorship.

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:44.040
So there was a DuckTales 2 game, it was not as popular.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:56.200
So it really though is, and by the way Yuki-chan's papa is Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, so gay, and it's

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.960
really one of the classic classic classics, and like I had to play the Moon level music

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:08.320
first, that is the identifiable stage, you play the beginning of that, and anyone who

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:14.760
knows their gaming history will be able to point that right out, so yeah.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.240
Alright, maybe that'll be a Capcom surprise announcement.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.400
They have a secondary surprise announcement, they're supposed to make it E3, right?

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.600
How about DuckTales 3 on the Wii?

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.680
That's the sound you would hear across the world, fanboys shitting their pants.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.680
That's right.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:38.200
You know, also though, just to say, you know, if we want to even look at any more of Yoshihiro

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:47.760
Sakaguchi's games, we have 1943, well 1943 Kai, we have Final Fight, Legendary Wings,

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:53.360
Forgotten Worlds, Mega Man, Mega Man 2, we have Street Fighter, Street Fighter 2, did

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.720
sound design, Warriors of Fate, so pretty cool.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.600
Very cool.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.160
One Night Stands asks, hey Dark Soccer, exactly why was this such a great game?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.900
I loved it as a kid, but it plays like a lot of other platformers.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.760
It just really, it's all of the elements combined, really, when you look at everything together,

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760
it's all those pieces.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.400
Yeah, I mean, yeah, there were a lot of platformers on the NES, but I think you had so many things

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.760
falling into place on this one.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.880
You had a pretty good game, which is very important, you had a great license.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.440
You could go back and do your favorite levels as much as you wanted to.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440
Right?

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:34.040
You know, it was kind of like that Mega Man mixed with, I don't know, Mario-style platformer,

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040
and great music.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.200
I mean, just everything kind of fell into place with this game.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:45.000
I think one other reason, think about all the crap movie and cartoon and TV show tie-in

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
games you have.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
God, I know, right?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
DuckTales breaks that mold, and I think for one, that might be one reason why people love

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.560
it so much, is that DuckTales was actually a pretty enjoyable game at the time it came

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.560
out.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.560
I really think so.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
That would be my best answer.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.560
I really agree with that.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.080
That, Rob, dear friend, is a proper assessment.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.560
All right, thank you.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.160
See, sometimes I say some good things on this program.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.940
It doesn't happen very often, but there you go.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:12.640
Tiger Claw says, I think what sets DuckTales apart from other platformers is the game mechanic

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.620
involving Scrooge's cane.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.620
That's true, too.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:18.480
You know, what other game really had that new mechanic of using the cane to kind of

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.000
knock things around and brought things into puzzles in a different way?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.400
But yeah, I mean, it's certainly a fair question to ask.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:32.400
If you have more questions you want to ask us, our Skype line is open right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.320
or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, you can call right now and give us a call.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.520
In the meantime, I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520
I don't have anything.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.920
I don't think Dark Soccer would have anything.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.120
Actually, you never know.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120
Oh, gosh.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.960
All right, let's go to the phones.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:50.960
We got a call.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:51.960
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:52.960
Shut that thing up.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.960
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.960
Who's this?

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:55.960
Hi, this is Stephanie.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:56.960
Hi, this is Spazinator.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.960
Hi, Spazinator.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.960
What's on your mind tonight?

01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960
Not much.

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:13.240
I was going to join the IRC chat, but unfortunately it won't work on my PlayStation 3.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.880
If you heard the Taylor and Bobby show, I was asking about possibly buying an arcade

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880
machine.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:36.520
What I'm specifically looking for is a classic game anywhere from the 80s up until the mid-90s.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.260
Let me ask you, are you looking to buy a specific game?

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:44.840
You want an actual authentic, this might have sat in a pizzeria back in the 80s type of

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.840
game.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.600
Or you want something, you know, you want something that will play all these games.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.720
You want like a main cabinet or you, I guess my question is, are you looking to collect

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.880
or are you just looking to play?

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:06.720
Um, I collect, uh, like the alphemics and singing, maybe the mayor's team and a pizzeria.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.400
I would go eBay, honestly.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.400
eBay or flea markets.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.960
Or even like Craigslist.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:17.280
DeNio's here in the Brisbane Sacramento area, they sell old arcade cabinets.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.640
You can even check, um, some of the entertainment companies that rent out the games and ask

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.280
if they're putting anything for sale, eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, we've come to them that

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.280
way.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.160
And I know this might sound, I know this might sound really cruel, but in this economy you

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.040
have a lot of places going under, um, especially like arcades and some pizzerias.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.640
These places might be unloading their stuff.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.600
So look for, you know, listings on Craigslist and so on, but you'd be surprised.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.360
eBay is a great place to start.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.640
Um, but here's one thing you want to keep in mind, Spaznator, shipping is going to be

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.060
a arm and a leg for a lot of these games.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.960
You might see some really cheap listings, like, you know, a $200 arcade machine.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.480
But at that, and if I remember right, you're in upstate New York.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.480
So if you buy a game from the West coast, you know, you're going to have to pay an arm

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.080
and a leg in shipping fees.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.920
So you probably want to stick to things.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:08.400
I mean, you could certainly find your widest selection there on eBay, but you would definitely

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.680
want to stick to things like Craigslist and things that are going to be a little more

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:15.320
local in your areas that you don't have to pay that obscene shipping fee.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.920
You have the perk of having New York city, not too, too far away.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.960
If you're especially willing to drive and pick something up with a pickup truck, you

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.280
can probably get some good deals.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280
Yeah.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.760
The thing is I never drove a day in my life.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.040
I never bothered to get my license.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:39.920
And I don't think, well, I don't have any relatives that really live in the area that

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:46.680
have a driver's license and have enough, you know, free time on their hands that would

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:55.520
be willing to, you know, essentially take me out to wherever, you know, to pick up arcade

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.160
gatherings and drive me back to my place.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.160
Well that's fair.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.480
I mean, if you don't have a license yourself, it's going to be kind of harder to get around

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480
and stuff.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.560
So you may have to just, you know, you may have to fork over those shipping fees, but

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.600
just be prepared.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.620
There's going to be shipping fees and sometimes they're as much as the games are themselves

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:14.720
because you're talking about, you know, sending a gigantic cabinet, which basically has to

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.080
go on the back of a truck.

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.400
You know, you are going to be spending a couple hundred dollars on shipping.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.560
So that's something you got to prepare yourself for when shopping, but if you can afford it,

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.280
if that's within your budget, go for it.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280
Yeah.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:33.680
Well, you know, if I do decide to go forward with this and get one, it'll probably be probably

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.240
a few months before I get it, but, you know, I kind of figured, you know, it just would

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.840
probably go hand in hand with, you know, my councils, you know, it would be a nice conversation

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:51.120
for you to talk about and not only that, but, you know, I kind of miss, you know, the whole

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.320
arcade experience that I used to have when I was, you know, a little kid, you know, going

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.560
to the pizzerias and playing games.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.560
And let me ask you a question actually, Spaznator, since you're about to drop hundreds of dollars

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:06.200
possibly on buying one of these machines for the nostalgia, you know, if you're going for

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.320
the collector's route, you're going to get one game.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.060
It's not going to be a main cabin or something like that, that you can fix, switch between

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.060
the different games.

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.560
You're going to get one game.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.600
And I know there's people that would spend a lot of money to have one game.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.000
Like I myself, I don't know that, well, I don't know, I'd have to think about it, but

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.120
there's certainly some games I would, I would buy.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.520
And you know, I see in chat right now, for instance, Brad and from Pod Culture says,

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.560
I would kill for a classic Star Wars arcade machine.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.840
What machine do you think you're going to drop the money on?

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:44.560
Um, well, I have like, uh, uh, top five first left, uh, you, uh, it would be like, uh, wall

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.760
of combat two, uh, super street fighter two turbo.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.920
Um, and then of course, uh, killer, uh, killer instance two.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:02.360
And uh, you know, then, uh, like the, you know, Neo Geo MBS, the four swap one.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.620
Now that, you know what, look into that.

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:08.840
That sounds like it might be a great option for you as those Neo Geo cabinets, because

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.720
of the fact you can fit like four games in there and that way you get that classic collectible

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.280
thing mixed in with, uh, Hey, I have more than just one game in here.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.520
That might be a good thing to look into, but the good news is with those fighting games,

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.600
they made so many of them, especially street fighter twos.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.880
I'm sure you wouldn't have a hard time finding one at all.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:27.280
Finding a working one might be more of a challenge, but you never know people.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.760
I mean, there's people that fix that shit up as a hobby.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.280
So you might be, yeah.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.280
Yeah.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.280
Yeah.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.520
I kind of figured with the, at least with the fighting games, it's, uh, at least joysticks

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.520
on them.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.800
Those two stars are going to be kind of beating out the joysticks themselves will probably

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.800
beat these off.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.800
Yep.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:45.800
All right.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.360
Well, a spasinator, we're going to let you go, but good luck in your quest.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360
Okay.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.360
All right.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.360
Thank you very much.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.360
No problem.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.360
Let us know when you get one.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.360
Okay.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.360
Goodbye.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360
Wow.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.560
That was kind of a funny goodbye message there.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:02.680
Uh, this kind of caused some, uh, my question to spasinator kind of caused this, uh, snowball

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.200
and chat talking about what games, uh, they would pay money for an S2 100.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.560
Matt wanted to throw out there.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.000
I would tell him to look for arcades that are closing down.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.440
Um, some other comments in chat, I want to say real quick, uh, one night stands said

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.560
he would pay the money for X-Men arcade.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.560
Renee says, prop cycle, the poor man's DDR.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.840
Vid power says Simpsons arcade.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.880
Um, and let's see what else is there.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.880
Uh, captain.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880
Yes.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.200
Said I would kill for a super scope cabinet.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.680
So there you go.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.640
Um, and we just had Skype crash.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640
That was weird.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.640
At least didn't crash my whole computer.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.640
Thank God.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.400
Skype just crashed sadly, and I was in the middle of a call when it did.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.520
So, so I apologize to the caller.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.760
Hopefully they will be able to get through again, but I am firing Skype back up so we

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.520
can take more calls and we look like we're back up.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.880
Sorry about that.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.520
That's kind of crappy.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.280
One eight seven seven game.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.160
Oler username on Skype, live radio guys.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:56.600
Sometimes Skype will crash on us as we're doing the show live.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.600
Yeah.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.600
I like what Bobby and Chad is saying, uh, talking about getting a 2d X cabinet.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.760
You know, I think if I were to drop the money, I'd have to get something Bemani related.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.800
Yeah, I think I'd get a 2d X and probably honestly I think I'd want a happy sky.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:09.800
We'll see.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800
Hey, we got another call.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800
Who's this?

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800
Wow.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800
I can't believe I got through for this.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:15.800
This is my first time calling.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800
This is excellent.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:17.800
Well, hi, excellent.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:18.800
Congratulations on making it through.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.600
You might've lucked out cause some other, unfortunately we were on the line with another

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.880
call and then Skype crashed and I really feel bad, but that's just live radio sometimes

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.520
and Hey, you got through and you've never been on before.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.000
So what's on your mind?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Well, first off, I, I don't know about exactly about the pinball games exactly, uh, uh, arcade.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I'm sorry.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Arcade games.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.440
I know about more, a little more about pinballs than I do arcade because I used to work on

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:42.840
them working at arcade.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:48.920
But um, yeah, the, um, the, the ones like street fighters and the use of those ones

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.320
are a little more commonplace to find than you would with some of the other ones.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.040
Um, the more newer they are, the easier to find.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:59.060
Of course, the more harder they're fine is the more older they are.

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:03.360
So you really would have to search and I know he's overseas, so that'd probably be even

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.000
more hard than it is over here in the U S where it's just a tad bit more commonplace

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.960
maybe than say like over there in Sweden.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:17.080
Uh, it really depends on all of those factors, but I do agree the best way to find an arcade

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.040
game without having to pay all the shipping, look for an, look for an arcade near you that's

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040
closing down.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040
Yeah.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:23.040
No joke.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.040
I'm bad.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.080
Like I said, before we closed down, unfortunately my arcade, we had like four and a half pages

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.080
full of arcade, different arcade games.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.520
So I mean, yeah, if you find one that's nearly getting ready to close down, you probably

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.080
can pick one up for a good price.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:37.080
Well there you go.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.760
Hopefully the advice will be taken, even though I think that last caller wasn't overseas,

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:44.380
they're upstate New York, but I know we do have other listeners that are overseas that

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.400
can take that, um, uh, advice to heart.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:49.720
Well what else is on your mind?

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.720
Glee.

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.720
Great show.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:52.720
First off.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:22:00.760
Yes, I was calling more in tone to THQ and their golden Wii that they sent over to overseas

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:01.760
there.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:02.760
Yes.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.600
Glee was amazing, by the way, if folks need a new TV show to watch, even though there's

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.280
only the one episode, definitely reminded me of being a music geek in high school.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.020
But ah, yes, we actually were gonna, before we made it a short show tonight when Loki

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:18.860
wasn't able to be here, we were gonna talk about the golden Wii.

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:21.960
Tell us a little bit about this and what you wanted to say about it.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:28.440
THQ, which unfortunately lost a major amount of money over the last year, which I thought

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:34.800
that was even more ironic, decided to send a golden Wii overseas to the UK to give to

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:38.380
the queen as a thank you.

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:39.380
For what?

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.380
A thank you for what?

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.380
Just being queenly?

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:45.960
Well, as a, as a, as a way to promoting their new game.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.960
Gotcha.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.840
I was gonna say though, come on, I don't think the queen is really gonna play this

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.840
Wii.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:57.040
She's obviously a little old and I think every time I've seen her in, in, you know, on TV

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.280
and stuff, she seems to be, have limited mobility.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:03.680
I'm sure someone would argue with me whether that means she can't play the Wii or not,

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.840
but you know, come on, she's a queen, she's the freaking queen of England.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.920
I think she's got better things to do than sit there and play the Wii.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.960
However, I think it's one of those things that you'll see in a museum someday as the

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:17.640
Wii the queen once owned, even though she never touched it.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.920
Supposedly she, she has a, uh, supposedly she was playing the Wii before with the prince.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.480
Supposedly there was articles about that, so that's why they sent her over one, so she

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480
could have one of her own.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:32.800
I stand corrected, what a great photo op that must have been.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.680
I just like to see her play Mike Tyson's punch out, I think that'd be even funnier.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.100
I don't know about that, I, she probably was playing something, probably Wii bowling, cause

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:46.040
I know that's something that, uh, this is gonna sound terrible, especially considering

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.600
I'm talking about the queen of England, but look, this is life, part of life is getting

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.600
old.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.920
Uh, the Wii bowling is really popular in, like, senior citizen centers, and like, all

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:57.480
these things, like, they'll actually have Wii bowling night at the senior citizen center

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:02.000
and all these really fun things, so I betcha that's what she was playing, if anything.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.800
And if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong again.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800
What else is new?

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.680
Nah, that's pretty much about it I can think of.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.260
I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of E3 in a couple weeks out of all these rumors

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.080
and stuff, and see which ones are true and which ones are false.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080
Me too.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:19.160
So, out of curiosity, what do you, since, you know, OLR can't compete with the commercial

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:24.080
sites, what do you want us to bring you from E3?

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:27.600
Whatever news is not given, I guess, because a lot of it's gonna be hard, because a lot

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.000
of the news, as soon as it's gonna break, is gonna be put all, posted all over the web

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.920
and Twitter and Facebook and all that, so.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.000
It's gonna be harder this year, cause there's no Kensha Hall for everyone to ignore, or

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.920
do the nice fluff piece that is, uh, you know, the one article on the entirety of Kensha

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.920
Hall.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.440
And from what I understand, we're not having that this year, so, uh, it's gonna be difficult

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:53.700
to really dig around, but we will try to find the Kensha in E3 for you guys.

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:59.720
What I would like to see is maybe even, you know, like, what the independent people are

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.720
doing.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.920
What are some of these games that are blowkey that should have been up to par, you know,

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.160
that should have been, you know, the major hits that are maybe not as hits.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:11.640
I will do my best to dig up the independent stuff for you guys, and I think that's where

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.400
we're gonna have to find our niche this year, is that I bet there's a lot of people that

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:19.760
want to be heard, and they're gonna be excited, uh, to have somebody care, and, uh, certainly,

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.640
you know what, let's find the next Braid.

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.800
Let's find the next Katamari Damacy.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.720
Let's find that next big thing that hasn't been discovered yet.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.720
I like that idea.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:33.280
All right, well, XLink, we gotta let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:37.320
you so much, first time caller, and, uh, we'll, uh, call us again sometime.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320
Oh, definitely.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320
All right, later, dude.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.320
Thanks.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.320
Uh, we'll take some more calls.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.400
Uh, by the way, some other comments from Chat Rehman, what they want to see from E3, rlbx327

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.400
wants to know about the iPhone games at E3, uh, actdef says, King of Fighter XII details.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.680
You know, I did get an email about a pre-tournament that's going on, but it's going on, like,

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.320
I think the Sunday before E3, so, sadly, we'll still be here, we can't go, but I know there's

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:05.360
gonna be some tournaments going on, uh, AlphaKananagram wants some Katamari Forever footage in a soundtrack

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360
bootleg.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.400
I don't know how Namco would feel about a bootleg on our site, but we'll try.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.120
Ha, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.080
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:25.880
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio, okay, the caller isn't there, apparently, uh, 1877

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.520
Game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio, remember, you can always test the calls

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:34.480
before giving us a call at Echo123 is the username on Skype, and that's a great way

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.480
to make sure that your microphone is working and all that fun stuff before you actually

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480
call us.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:41.680
Of course, that doesn't work with a touch tone phone, um, touch tone phones are much

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.600
easier though, you just pick up the phone and call, I don't think I've ever seen a phone

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.560
not work, although I have seen them be quiet, I've just never seen them, like, not actually

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.560
work at all.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.560
Let's try this again.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.560
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:54.040
Sorry about that, my mic's screwed up, it's Gold Anthro.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.200
That's alright, I'm glad you got through, because I know you were the caller that we

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.160
crashed on earlier, well, what's on your mind?

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.000
Ah, don't worry about it.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.600
Um, well, I guess I could say I had a, uh, quite a weekend, uh, uh, along with, uh, one

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:13.480
of the OLR staff members, DJ Ron Mass, I went to Anime Boston 2009 this weekend, on Saturday.

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.800
Ah, and how was that?

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.680
I'm happy to hear that, uh, there was some OLR meetups going on, because I know somewhere

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.340
in the Bay Area right now, GS68 is crying because he's the only OLR guy at Fanime, which

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:28.000
I'm very sad I didn't get to this year, but, next year, next year, well, how was Anime

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Boston?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.700
Uh, it was good, um, I guess, uh, it was my first convention, I really didn't know what

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:40.360
to expect, but, um, uh, it was pretty good, it was pretty good, um, one of the first things

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:46.160
I did was find, uh, DJ Ron Mass, um, he, uh, was selling some stuff, he didn't seem to

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:51.160
have any good luck this, uh, weekend, but he said overall he had a good time, I guess,

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.480
I guess he'll be calling in maybe next week to talk about it, I think he's getting home

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.480
late.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.480
Oh, I'm sure he will.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.480
Today's his birthday too, if I'm not mistaken, so happy birthday to you guys, if you're with

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.480
me.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.000
Yes, yes it is, everybody wish him a happy birthday, I know I did.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
So he's probably out enjoying that and not listening to the show tonight, which I completely

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000
understand.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.080
Um, here's something I'm gonna ask you, one thing that always impressed me about Anime

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.120
conventions, you know, I'm not super into Anime, I don't know how much you're into it

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.560
or what have you, but one thing that always kind of impressed me about the conventions,

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.680
despite my lack of knowledge, is the art dealer rooms, and some of the fan inspired art that

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.800
you see in these rooms, um, you know, and this crosses over into video games too, because

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.060
I'll tell you, you can't walk through one of these, uh, hallways without seeing some

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.960
Kingdom Hearts inspired, you know, fan art or something.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.400
Did you see any art, I don't know if you looked around the art dealer room, did you see some

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.720
art that really jumped out of you that you thought was awesome, and what was it?

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:44.240
I saw a lot of stuff, I saw anything from like, like Anime stuff from like Death Note,

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:49.560
if I've seen the typical, stereotypical, stupid Naruto stuff, that's just my opinion, not

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.600
fact, but I just, that's not my thing.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:57.960
Uh, I also found video game stuff, uh, like basically, uh, what did you say you were wondering

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:58.960
if there was there?

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.560
Oh, I don't know, I know there's always something Kingdom Hearts, but did anything kind of jump

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.560
out of you?

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:04.560
Kingdom Hearts, yes.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.560
Okay, let me give you an example.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.680
Let me give you an example, when I was at, um, ASEN, I actually bought this, I thought

01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:15.600
it was so rad, because I bought it for, um, my boyfriend, who, um, I know is a big fan

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.560
of this, but, um, they actually had an art dealer table, and she had a drawing of David

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:25.160
Bowie from Labyrinth, and I just thought that was so awesome, I'm like, how random to find

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.760
something like that in an Anime con, but did you see anything that like, like, jumped out

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:29.760
of you like that?

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.160
Like, wow, I didn't expect to see that at an art dealer table.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:40.960
Um, I, I, I guess, a lot, pretty much everything was unexpected for me, like I said, this was

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.560
my first con, I, I saw, I mean, there was someone with little, uh, I also have a friend

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:51.800
in chat called our Robocon that doesn't seem to get to listen to OLR a lot, but he tries

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:57.720
to catch the podcast, he's live in there now, um, but, uh, we, we went together on Saturday,

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:02.160
and I got, I got some, uh, they had like little buttons they were selling for like 50 cents

01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.160
to a hundred, I mean, one dollar, uh, I got like a little thing from The World Ends With

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:11.240
You, that little pin that you'd get in the RPG game, that portable RPG game that says

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.280
you're, you're in, you're in the, uh, game thing, I don't know if you...

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.960
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I, okay, that's cool, and yeah, The World Ends With You definitely

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.440
is, uh, has its fans, especially the Squeenix fans, so okay, cool, cool.

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:30.120
Yeah, I also saw, I saw something interesting, it was a stained glass thing, um, of various

01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:36.000
Death Note anime characters, um, it had the character, the Detective L, but it was like

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.080
a vampire version of him with like blue hair, and it was pretty cool, it was like stained

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:42.080
glass.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.080
That sounds kind of neat, stained glass is always pretty cool, well look, I want to ask

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.320
you about this before we let you go, but how about the game room?

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.320
Sure.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.480
I mean, we're video games and gaming, how was the game room in anime Boston?

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:57.160
I was, I was going to bring that up, yeah, the game room was, um, it, it was, uh, I think

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:02.520
they used like the, uh, Grand Ballroom and the, see this is in Boston, Massachusetts,

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.960
the Heinz Convention Center, they were, I think they used the ballroom for the, uh,

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:13.360
video game thing, uh, when they, what?

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.360
Go ahead, Will.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:17.080
What kind of games did you see in the room when you went there?

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:23.960
Um, I saw, they had a Street Fighter IV tournament going on, they had, uh, I, I finally got to

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.240
play popin' music, it was pretty, that was a pretty cool experience.

01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:29.240
I love popin' music.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:35.000
Yeah, I know, uh, that's why I had, that's why I brought that up, and, um, the interesting

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.920
thing is, they had, they had, they had the Rock Band 2 set up with the, uh, on the Xbox

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:45.840
360, the interesting thing I saw was that Nintendo Wii that they had actually was using,

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.440
running on the homebrew channel, uh, the, uh, homebrew channel, which allows you to

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:55.480
run, like, um, self-made applications, among other things, and they were using it for perfectly,

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.280
uh, legitimate reasons, so I thought, I thought it was kinda cool.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280
Of course.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280
Of course.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.560
Okay, I got one more question for you before we let you go, and it actually comes from

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:05.400
our chat room, from our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf, heard before us here Sunday nights on

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.400
All Games Radio.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.960
Uh, Bobby asked, Anime Boston is in the same place as PAX Boston is going to be.

01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:16.480
How was the size of the place, because some people are speculating it may not be big enough

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.920
for an event the size of PAX.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:26.520
Um, I think, I think that it's, uh, well, I think there's, there's like three floors,

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:32.560
um, three, I think it's like a three-floor place, and, uh, we were all around it, and,

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.280
uh, uh, it's pretty big, it really is, it's, it's bigger than, uh, I thought it was gonna

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.280
be.

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:42.080
Like, there's a, there's a mall that's, like, attached to it, like, uh, and we got some

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.440
food there afterwards, but, but it's, it's pretty big, I mean, even without that, the

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:51.200
convention center itself, I mean, it, it, so yeah, I think it could handle PAX, PAX

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:55.400
East, because, I mean, the attendance just keeps climbing every year on Anime Boston

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:58.760
as it is, so yeah, it could probably handle that.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:03.380
That's interesting news, because I was, uh, I saw that the, uh, I was expecting it to

01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:08.400
be Memorial Day weekend the next week, and it wasn't, so I, I saw that it was, like,

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:13.480
April 2nd or 4th from, uh, Anime Boston, so probably somebody else, like, took, took the

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:14.480
Memorial Day weekend.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.600
Yeah, it happens, it happens, there's a lot of big conventions, Memorial Day weekend.

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:21.360
Alright, well, um, we gotta let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for the report, and, uh,

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:23.040
glad to hear you enjoyed your first con.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.280
Yeah, thanks a lot, Rob.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.280
No problem.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.200
Maybe I'll see you at PAX Boston, speaking of which, since it sounds like this is your

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.200
neck of the woods.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:34.680
I'll see what I can do, uh, I have to, I, I'll have to work things out, but we'll, we'll

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:35.680
meet someday.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680
Alright, someday.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680
I'll see you later.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680
Alright, take care, buddy.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680
Someday, Gadget.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.680
Bye.

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.440
I'll get you next time, Gadget.

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.440
Next time.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:44.440
Um, why not?

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.920
We'll do one more call if it comes in pretty soon here on the phones.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.040
How you doing over there, Doc Soccer?

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.040
You've...

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.840
I'm doing fine, I'm actually checking for video game sims.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:51.840
Oh, yeah?

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:56.600
I found one of, uh, Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 4, so that's a pretty good one.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:57.600
That's fun.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.160
You know, I still have yet to play Resident Evil 5, what the hell's wrong with me?

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.800
But, outside, outside of the demo.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:07.200
Alright, well, our phones, sadly, are not really ringing right now, so we're gonna go

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:08.200
ahead and close up the lines.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.200
Dammit, call!

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.200
Nah, it's too late, I closed up the lines.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:14.160
We're at about an hour and a half now, anyway, and I wanna go run out and get some food and,

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.680
and enjoy the rest of my Memorial Day weekend, as I'm sure a lot of you folks do.

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.680
So we're gonna go ahead and go around and start to wrap things up, and get on out of

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680
here for the evening.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.680
So, um...

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680
In ribbons and bows?

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680
If we want to.

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:26.040
Uh, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:29.500
I guess we'll start with me tonight, although I don't have much of a final thought tonight.

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.160
My final thought is...

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.160
Yogurt.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:33.160
I want yogurt.

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.160
I want some too!

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.800
That would be amazing right now, would be some yogurt.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.480
That would be fant- fantastical.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:39.480
Not fro-gurt.

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.480
But yogurt.

01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:44.320
Cause the fro-gurt has potassium benzoate.

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.320
Never mind.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.320
Uh...

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.920
Dark Sakura, what's your final thought tonight?

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.920
Um...

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.920
Porn.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.480
There you go, it ended how it began.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:56.760
Hey, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting Independent Podcasting.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.440
Loki should be back next week, as will I, as will Dark Sakura, for our big pre-E3 show.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.920
I know you've probably heard E3 talked about to death on other shows, but we are gonna

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:09.000
be taking your last request for what you want to see us cover at E3, and all of that we'll

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.240
be doing next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.800
If- again, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about the program, help

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:20.480
spread the good word about the show, help offset those a-holes that leave negative reviews

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.100
on websites because they have nothing better to do with their sorry-ass lives, uh, because

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:28.920
it really helps, you know, us have the motivation to keep going when you guys, uh, say good

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:32.800
things about us and- and just knowing we have certain people that would be here every week.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:33.800
You know-

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.480
I also like when you send me money.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.440
Although sometimes it can be frustrating when people bitch and moan and bellyache when you

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.900
go a week without a show, or that the podcast was late or whatever, it does show that people

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:49.800
care enough to complain, so I actually kind of see the good in that, and thanks everybody

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:54.080
for your passion around the show, it- it- that is very motivating, surprisingly enough.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.480
So keep us on our toes, I guess is what I'm saying.

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:57.480
Twinkle toes!

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.480
There you go.

01:35:58.480 --> 01:35:59.480
Alright, that's it.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.480
We're out of here.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.840
Have a great night everybody, and uh, tune in next week, we'll be back with more of Orange

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:04.840
Lounge Radio.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.840
Have a great night.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:09.440
