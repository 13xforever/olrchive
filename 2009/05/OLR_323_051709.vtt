00:00.000 --> 00:19.280
Today, May 17, 2009, the studio behind Duke Nukem Forever closes.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.480
Details are revealed on Guitar Hero 5.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.640
And could a popular import fighting game be U.S. bound?

00:31.640 --> 00:35.780
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.780 --> 00:36.880
Lounge Radio.

00:36.880 --> 00:41.800
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:41.800 --> 00:42.800
lifestyle.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.400
That's right, we're back May 17, 2009.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.980
We were off last week, that was my bad.

00:47.980 --> 00:51.200
This is Rob Roberts here with you every week on the show, except last week.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.040
Joining us, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.800
What are you doing in my house?

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
I'm sorry.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.800
Yes, we have a studio change tonight, which is kind of interesting.

01:00.800 --> 01:08.080
The AC at Studio Roberts broke, so now we're here at Studio Dark Sakura, and it's kind

01:08.080 --> 01:09.960
of different, but good.

01:09.960 --> 01:14.180
I'm hoping the sound is still the same and everybody is hearing things like they were

01:14.180 --> 01:15.580
before.

01:15.580 --> 01:18.620
This is kind of nice though, because in this compacted space, I'm able to adjust audio

01:18.620 --> 01:23.160
a little easier as we go, so hopefully there's no popping and breaking tonight on the show.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.160
We'll see.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.160
Although I think Dark Sakura might have been a little loud, but that's all right.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.540
We'll fix these things as we go.

01:27.540 --> 01:28.540
It's live radio.

01:28.540 --> 01:29.540
What can you do?

01:29.540 --> 01:32.800
You just have to kind of fix things as they come up, but we'll still be taking your calls.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.920
We're wired for everything except Justin TV, sadly.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.540
We have to say goodbye to Justin TV for tonight, but we're hoping to get that back in a future

01:41.540 --> 01:42.920
week.

01:42.920 --> 01:47.440
We might actually relocate within the relocation for the summer into a bigger space here in

01:47.440 --> 01:48.440
the house.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.440
We'll see.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.680
Anyway, I won't bore you with the details, but I will bore you with the one and only

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
tech master, Loki.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
Hello.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.400
How are you doing, Loki?

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
Could be better.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.400
Oh, really?

01:58.400 --> 02:03.120
I'm sitting on a step stool that's as hard as a rock.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.120
We'll figure it out.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.500
Maybe at the halfway point we can switch and you can stay on.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.560
We can get you a chair for next week.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.000
We'll figure something out.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
We'll work it out.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.600
Anyhow, we're back, and of course we have a little time to catch up on, so we'll play

02:17.600 --> 02:20.400
a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, because that's how we always start things

02:20.400 --> 02:21.400
off.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.400
So How Was Your Gaming Week?

02:22.400 --> 02:26.000
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

02:26.000 --> 02:30.320
Well, I played Sims.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.320
Sims 2.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.320
That's about it.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.400
Do you like to torture your Sims, or do you actually play it legitimately?

02:35.400 --> 02:41.160
I actually have been tweaking my Sims to try to put more stuff, modding more this, that,

02:41.160 --> 02:44.560
and the other, and now I have a dirty object.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.840
So, just to see how it worked, and now I'm curious.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.840
Okay.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.840
We'll leave it at that then, I suppose.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.840
Yes.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.480
Are you excited for Sims 3?

02:54.480 --> 02:55.480
Kind of.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.280
I was looking on the Twitter earlier, and looking at the friends list on the Twitter,

02:58.280 --> 03:01.680
and apparently some of our listeners are pretty excited, because I guess Sims 3 just leaked

03:01.680 --> 03:05.480
out, so some folks are already downloading that and having fun with it.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.480
Really?

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
Uh-oh.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.480
No, not during the show.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.480
Yeah, not during the show.

03:09.480 --> 03:16.440
Leave it to Loki in five minutes to try and pirate something from the new location, geez.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.440
And share.

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
Alright.

03:18.440 --> 03:23.440
I'm not surprised, though, especially with, although I am surprised it's so early, a lot

03:23.440 --> 03:24.920
of EA leaks this week.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.520
But of course, Loki will buy the game if he enjoys it.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.520
Of course I will.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.520
Alright.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.520
Anyhow.

03:30.520 --> 03:35.240
No, I probably won't enjoy it, though, just like I enjoyed Spore.

03:35.240 --> 03:41.560
I found the case for that today with the DVD inside, and I'm like, oh yeah, I have Spore.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.560
More like Bore.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.560
Alright.

03:43.560 --> 03:47.040
Well, that's it for Dark Cyros gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:47.040 --> 03:52.200
My gaming week was pretty brief, I spent most of the week flashing all my drives, upgrading

03:52.200 --> 03:57.960
the drive firmwares in all my 360s, so now instead of having one modded 360, I have four

03:57.960 --> 04:03.320
of the five so far, because the last one which had the light on drive, which is a bitch and

04:03.320 --> 04:12.080
a half the flash, the setup I had didn't want to work with it correctly, and so it was able

04:12.080 --> 04:18.240
to grab the key and that kind of stuff, but I had to actually take my broken 360 and take

04:18.240 --> 04:20.480
that drive and spoof it as the one.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.340
Anyways, so basically I have four modded systems now, and the whole reason we have four modded

04:24.340 --> 04:29.800
systems is because we're playing four modded copies of Grand Theft Auto IV in our company

04:29.800 --> 04:34.880
Deathmatch that we do, and it's all sorts of fun.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.460
Right now we're testing out some of the new weapons that I'm building for it.

04:38.460 --> 04:43.640
One of them is kind of like, I'm calling it the Hurricane Bomb, and basically what it

04:43.640 --> 04:50.000
does is you fire it and it creates a giant physics force that will toss people around.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.240
No damage, but it will throw people and you can throw them into walls and stuff and that

04:54.240 --> 04:55.440
causes damage.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.180
So we've been playing with that and it's absolutely distracting.

04:58.180 --> 04:59.880
You know what kind of weapon you need to make?

04:59.880 --> 05:04.180
And maybe I just have Star Trek on the brain because that movie was so fucking epic.

05:04.180 --> 05:06.880
You need a red matter weapon, that's what you need.

05:06.880 --> 05:11.320
I tried making something- How could you program a singularity in a game?

05:11.320 --> 05:15.080
Something to create a black hole- Something to make the game suck!

05:15.080 --> 05:17.960
There's nothing to create, unfortunately, a negative physics force.

05:17.960 --> 05:23.080
You can sort of, I don't know, the game won't let you do that, because if it could, I've

05:23.080 --> 05:26.880
already thought about that and, you know, a bomb that would explode, suck everything

05:26.880 --> 05:29.960
towards it, which would be pretty sweet.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.960
But that doesn't work.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.880
And I tried creating a flamethrower and that didn't really work as well.

05:33.880 --> 05:38.120
The game's just very sensitive and some of the things I'm trying to make it do causes

05:38.120 --> 05:40.160
the crash and that's not good.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.940
So that's just fun, you know, to basically play against each other.

05:43.940 --> 05:49.280
Really the only reason I need to mod all four systems is because if you put one of the weapons

05:49.280 --> 05:53.520
on- The way it calculates damage and physics and stuff like that, you actually have to

05:53.520 --> 05:58.840
have all the systems modded the same with the same kind of, you know, edits to the game

05:58.840 --> 06:02.200
in order for it to work correctly, because otherwise it just doesn't work.

06:02.200 --> 06:08.640
But yeah, it's been a lot of fun and I'm trying to get some more stuff added into that.

06:08.640 --> 06:13.440
So aside from playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC and Lost and Damned on the 360,

06:13.440 --> 06:19.160
I've also been playing Rock Band Unplugged because that somehow leaked online and so,

06:19.160 --> 06:21.240
you know, I have to check it out.

06:21.240 --> 06:25.960
Honestly I'm glad I checked it out this way because I can't see myself purchasing this

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
game.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.000
I think I get bored with it really fast.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Really?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Why?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Because I get bored with Rock Band pretty fast.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.720
It's just not the same as playing like Rock Band.

06:33.720 --> 06:38.880
I mean it's, you know, frequency amplitude so at least that way they can kind of add

06:38.880 --> 06:42.200
music that would normally not be in like Rock Band, you know, doesn't have to necessarily

06:42.200 --> 06:43.200
be rock music.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.220
They can do electronica and all that sort of stuff.

06:46.220 --> 06:48.480
But I don't know.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.400
Like I spent more time I think customizing my characters than I did actually playing

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
the game.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.520
And it's alright.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.000
It's what it is I guess.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.560
But I don't know.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
It's just alright.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.560
I don't think I'd buy it though.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.140
How does it compare to like frequency and amplitude in all those games we think this

07:07.140 --> 07:09.440
game was inspired by?

07:09.440 --> 07:13.060
Honestly I've never really, I haven't played too much of frequency or amplitude but from

07:13.060 --> 07:17.280
the little that I have played it's pretty much the same type of thing.

07:17.280 --> 07:21.240
You know, except kind of the Rock Band set up where you have the same sort of graphics

07:21.240 --> 07:25.120
that you'd see in Rock Band except you're jumping between three, you know, four different

07:25.120 --> 07:26.120
tracks.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.720
And you are switching a lot through there and that's kind of where I mess up usually

07:28.720 --> 07:29.720
in the songs.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.280
Because the songs themselves aren't that hard.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.040
Obviously I'm not playing on like expert difficulty or anything like that but I'm just playing

07:35.040 --> 07:37.320
on normal difficulty that's in the game.

07:37.320 --> 07:41.720
It's not that hard but it's just, you know, jumping back and forth between tracks.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.960
You know, I miss usually the first note or something like that because I'm like oh crap

07:45.960 --> 07:49.520
oh it doesn't want me to jump here it wants me to jump here and it's like uhh, it's kind

07:49.520 --> 07:50.520
of annoying.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.080
But I don't know, it's alright.

07:53.080 --> 07:58.640
I guess, I mean there's no real good music games on the PSP other than like DJ Max so

07:58.640 --> 08:02.120
you know, more than merrier I guess.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.640
I still kind of want to buy it, we'll see, we'll see.

08:05.640 --> 08:10.180
Okay so my gaming week, before I get to my gaming week since I did kind of invoke Star

08:10.180 --> 08:15.460
Trek I just have to say, oh my god, was that not like the greatest thing ever?

08:15.460 --> 08:18.800
Like that movie was so awesome and like I know there's probably some people out there

08:18.800 --> 08:22.840
that don't really want to hear it because like you know every movie has it's detractors

08:22.840 --> 08:25.760
but I got to tell you, you don't have to be a Trekkie to appreciate Star Trek.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.000
That was the goal I think.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.080
You'll appreciate it more probably if you aren't a Trekkie.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.200
You'll pick up on a lot of in-jokes if you're a Trekkie but I think one thing I like about

08:33.200 --> 08:37.200
what J.J. Abrams did is that they took out, and the writers, they took out a lot of like

08:37.200 --> 08:39.020
the techno talk.

08:39.020 --> 08:42.520
You know, they made it very accessible to anybody and the acting was great.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.480
I was so surprised by the guy who played Kirk.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.360
I think was actually my favorite which is amazing because usually I'm a huge Sylar fan

08:48.360 --> 08:49.880
but I was just kind of thinking about it today.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.600
I do think though that his Spock was pretty hardcore.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.280
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, he was awesome.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.280
They were all great.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.360
The closest though of anybody was McCoy.

08:59.360 --> 09:07.040
He must have had his séance before you know filming every day and channeled De Force Kelly

09:07.040 --> 09:11.120
because he was perfect and better than being Cupid.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
It makes me more excited.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.120
Did you recognize him?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.120
No, I didn't.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.120
No, I didn't.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.120
He was Cupid in Xena.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.120
Okay, okay.

09:17.120 --> 09:22.600
No, I haven't seen Xena in so long but it made me more excited for the Star Trek MMO

09:22.600 --> 09:27.600
because I'm hoping this invigorates a whole new life into Star Trek like I hope we get

09:27.600 --> 09:31.240
a new show like I don't think we'll get a show out of this movie like you know the actors

09:31.240 --> 09:34.480
in this are too big I think to want to do a TV show every week in fact one of them's

09:34.480 --> 09:38.560
already doing a TV show every week but I'm all considering the way that show's gonna

09:38.560 --> 09:42.480
you know kind of headed he may not be doing that TV show much longer true he might be

09:42.480 --> 09:46.440
suddenly available but I'm I'm hoping that at least we'll get a new like you know maybe

09:46.440 --> 09:51.480
something in the next generation canon you know some something after you know that I

09:51.480 --> 09:54.480
just don't want another prequel I'd like to see something later well these aren't this

09:54.480 --> 09:59.760
isn't a prequel I know I don't want spoilery but you know what I mean it's it's I know

09:59.760 --> 10:06.040
I know I just want out there now that you can say it's a franchise reboot yeah that's

10:06.040 --> 10:10.120
that's for sure that's for sure it's very interesting they're talking about that possibly

10:10.120 --> 10:14.800
in the in the sequel they're gonna do Khan again which would be very interesting they

10:14.800 --> 10:20.080
could do Khan the first time around it's we have no Montalban I know it'd be weird we

10:20.080 --> 10:25.120
have no rich Corinthian leather all right anyhow sorry I didn't mean to derail the show

10:25.120 --> 10:30.100
but you know what this this this Star Trek movie being so good makes me excited like

10:30.100 --> 10:35.040
for the game that's coming out you know in a little while and I haven't played the Xbox

10:35.040 --> 10:38.600
Live arcade game that's out there but like the MMO I'm talking about it makes me all

10:38.600 --> 10:44.520
excited for Star Trek I'm making us a race huh I'm making us an official race the olorians

10:44.520 --> 10:48.560
the olorians that'd be awesome and of course my other character is gonna be an Orion side

10:48.560 --> 10:53.760
girl so why not all right anyhow my gaming week though I didn't play a whole lot of new

10:53.760 --> 10:57.360
stuff I've just been kind of busy in my personal life like Dark Sakura but I did get a chance

10:57.360 --> 11:02.840
to check out space invaders extreme on the Xbox Live arcade marketplace which is of course

11:02.840 --> 11:06.640
pretty much a port of the PSP version of the game although there have been some changes

11:06.640 --> 11:10.560
of course now they have the multiplayer mode and things a lot of fun it's fun to play on

11:10.560 --> 11:14.760
my big TV with my big sound system and I think it's great for 10 bucks I think it's a lot

11:14.760 --> 11:20.440
of fun I think the game itself is pretty simple which I think is a good thing I think it's

11:20.440 --> 11:24.920
very easy to get into and you know I think it's a type of game I might want to put some

11:24.920 --> 11:29.120
headphones on and just kind of get sucked into which is weird because you think I'd

11:29.120 --> 11:33.120
enjoy it more on the PSP and I do it's a great PSP game but I like the fact that now it has

11:33.120 --> 11:37.160
some online modes it's kind of expanded on Xbox Live Arcade so is the game worth buying

11:37.160 --> 11:42.120
twice yes I think so I think $10 is a fair price for the game and I think it's fun but

11:42.120 --> 11:48.560
of course I also love retro upgraded classics like you know I loved Pac-Man versus I even

11:48.560 --> 11:52.880
like the new Galaga you know I love these souped up retro games usually you know when

11:52.880 --> 11:57.040
it comes to like Leisure Shoot Larry not so much but you know so a lot of the ones especially

11:57.040 --> 12:00.820
they've been putting out on Xbox Live Arcade lately have been great now one other place

12:00.820 --> 12:04.800
that I did get to play a lot of arcade games this week was I went to of course Anime Central

12:04.800 --> 12:09.080
or Asen for short which is where I was and why we weren't here last week on the show

12:09.080 --> 12:12.080
but they had a little game room set up and I got to play some of the arcade games they

12:12.080 --> 12:16.800
had in there such as BeatMania 2DX Gold I believe it was was in there which is cool

12:16.800 --> 12:20.480
because I hadn't played 2DX in a couple months even though we have one here in town I just

12:20.480 --> 12:24.820
never seemed to check out there and then I also played Guitar Freaks which is interesting

12:24.820 --> 12:30.620
because I haven't played Guitar Freaks in a very long time like the last time I remember

12:30.620 --> 12:36.240
actually playing Guitar Freaks was probably not long after I originally bought Guitar

12:36.240 --> 12:40.760
Hero on the Xbox you know so it's been like a long time and it's kind of interesting that

12:40.760 --> 12:45.920
can your Guitar Hero and Rock Band skill help you improve in Guitar Freaks yes a little

12:45.920 --> 12:51.220
bit except the timing is much different and Guitar Freaks I'm sorry is still not as great

12:51.220 --> 12:58.360
of a game it needs a reboot it needs JJ Abrams to come fix it is what Guitar Freaks needs

12:58.360 --> 13:03.040
Rock Revolution not so much so I don't know if that series is dead or what but it was

13:03.040 --> 13:06.720
it was fun to revisit I mean it does have songs you know if you like the j-rock you

13:06.720 --> 13:09.920
know you're not really going to get a lot of those songs in the games over here but

13:09.920 --> 13:14.480
uh yeah Guitar Freaks stick a fork in it it's pretty much done it needs a reboot like most

13:14.480 --> 13:19.360
Bomani games right now need a reboot JJ Abrams needs to go work for Konami and reboot everything

13:19.360 --> 13:25.440
over there I think except for Metal Gear Solid that franchise is doing alright still he should

13:25.440 --> 13:30.280
be directing Metal Gear Solid movie that'd be amazing but you know that guy's gonna be

13:30.280 --> 13:36.360
in demand now so dream on on that one alright um let's see what else did I play at the con

13:36.360 --> 13:42.480
I watched people playing in the groove 2 and pump it up NX and DDR but there was so many

13:42.480 --> 13:46.720
people playing all those games I was a little disappointed by their console showing though

13:46.720 --> 13:51.240
especially the first night like half their TVs weren't even on and I was like how did

13:51.240 --> 13:54.960
they not have Tatsunoko versus Capcom at an anime convention of course they had it by

13:54.960 --> 13:59.040
Saturday night but a little disappointed in the console showing in their game room but

13:59.040 --> 14:02.440
it got a little better as the con went on I don't know if they had some snafus or what

14:02.440 --> 14:08.460
but um one of the things I thought was cool was at the con there were nine of us sharing

14:08.460 --> 14:13.540
a hotel room yes nine of us sharing a hotel room Misty of course if you listen to show

14:13.540 --> 14:18.000
a long time you probably recognize that name as one of our OLR supporters organized this

14:18.000 --> 14:23.360
whole thing amongst you know a lot of folks she knew and just what have you kind of like

14:23.360 --> 14:26.680
friends of friends and there were nine of us in a room but what was cool about that

14:26.680 --> 14:33.360
is one night we had Street Fighter IV going on the TV in the hotel room which was a plasma

14:33.360 --> 14:38.200
HD TV it was a nice TV because this is the Hyatt it was a pretty nice hotel so we hooked

14:38.200 --> 14:43.860
up two arcade sticks to the TV and just had a ball with it it was a lot of fun and congrats

14:43.860 --> 14:50.360
by the way to OLR me member Rob D for winning the Street Fighter IV tournament at ASEN very

14:50.360 --> 14:55.920
nice work so that was pretty much it for my gaming week I had a good time I had fun at

14:55.920 --> 15:01.160
the convention and yeah thanks to everybody who came out for the panel and if you are

15:01.160 --> 15:04.700
a new listener of the show because of the panel I'm surprised there were a lot of people

15:04.700 --> 15:08.000
there that hadn't really heard the show before but said they would check it out so hello

15:08.000 --> 15:11.640
to everybody from ASEN who is listening and thank you very much for tuning in to Orange

15:11.640 --> 15:16.120
Lounge Radio so let's move on and get into some news you're probably sick about hearing

15:16.120 --> 15:20.440
about us let's give them some news first we have some housekeeping to take care of the

15:20.440 --> 15:25.040
SmileDK giveaway is tonight and you have about like 10 minutes to get your entries in I know

15:25.040 --> 15:29.160
I said on the Twitter 5 o'clock but because of the studio move you got a little extra

15:29.160 --> 15:34.240
time but we're going to have to take care of that during the break tonight so if you

15:34.240 --> 15:37.840
don't know what I'm talking about guess you should have downloaded last week's podcast

15:37.840 --> 15:40.940
you might be too late now unless you hurry Dark Soccer you have housekeeping tonight

15:40.940 --> 15:46.720
yeah we had um didn't he also win the turbo graphics he did and I wasn't able to take

15:46.720 --> 15:52.160
that to him but yeah because I can't find it uh oh well no it's just I mean you see

15:52.160 --> 15:56.640
how much stuff I have I I have an idea where it is trust me as soon as I locate the turbo

15:56.640 --> 16:01.520
graphics it's yours yeah otherwise I was saying a Saturn with no cords he uh well maybe we

16:01.520 --> 16:05.240
can give that away in a future show I think I have a spare hookups he asked he actually

16:05.240 --> 16:08.920
asked me about it but he you know I was like oh she didn't have a chance to see me he understood

16:08.920 --> 16:14.080
he knew you've been busy so he he knows he'll get it pulling my brain out through my ears

16:14.080 --> 16:18.440
that's all right school sucks uh and let's see uh of course I already mentioned that

16:18.440 --> 16:22.720
we're at a new summer home for the show so we've for those of you stalking at home we've

16:22.720 --> 16:26.440
moved from Rancho Cordova to what Citrus Heights are we in now are we technically in Citrus

16:26.440 --> 16:30.080
Heights yes we have no longer in Rancho Cambodia all right so we've uh moved the show that's

16:30.080 --> 16:33.880
right there'll be less gunshots here in uh Citrus Heights that'll be nice unless uh police

16:33.880 --> 16:38.160
helicopters flying overhead at the end of the show uh and unfortunately though there's

16:38.160 --> 16:42.920
no justin tv tonight we're hoping to have it up again next week but it may be a little

16:42.920 --> 16:47.600
while just because we had to move a lot over here and justin tv has a lot of cable and

16:47.600 --> 16:52.800
wires so remember guys it's a radio show first video show and it's too bad too because I

16:52.800 --> 16:57.720
had by net commando oh bummer but hey at least we have to play that after the show yeah all

16:57.720 --> 17:01.960
right anyhow um let's get into some gaming news that's what we're here it's been a very

17:01.960 --> 17:06.600
very busy week as we start to ramp up to e3 stuff is just spilling out and we have lots

17:06.600 --> 17:11.240
of e3 rumors but first some facts and loki's gonna start us off with a cold hard facts

17:11.240 --> 17:19.280
tonight fact duke nukem forever is still not out and um this isn't helping 3d realms the

17:19.280 --> 17:25.580
developer of said game is actually or i should say publishing said game is no longer around

17:25.580 --> 17:33.960
they've actually shut down and um have seats to um operate due to funding issues and apparently

17:33.960 --> 17:38.960
um apogee software has also laid off all the staff that probably doesn't help the game

17:38.960 --> 17:43.960
come out any sooner now when you think about it um and then on top of all that you may

17:43.960 --> 17:51.800
not know this but um take two i was apparently financing duke nukem forever and um had invested

17:51.800 --> 17:59.480
approximately 12 million dollars according to take two and never and according to um

17:59.480 --> 18:03.120
scott miller at 3d realms of course they're saying that they never received any of that

18:03.120 --> 18:09.920
money and of course the game's not done yet so now take two is actually filed a lawsuit

18:09.920 --> 18:18.040
against um the former 3d realms members and demanding that they get their source code

18:18.040 --> 18:23.440
kind of sounds like a whole lot of um stuff that was going on with uh you know scratching

18:23.440 --> 18:30.080
dj hero but hopefully if they do finally turn over that source code take two the game will

18:30.080 --> 18:36.400
actually be finished and you know take two makes some pretty awesome games so that could

18:36.400 --> 18:42.720
be good definitely would come out a lot sooner than say 10 years or more than 10 years god

18:42.720 --> 18:47.480
i don't even know how many years it is now well sorry to hear it 3d realms this has been

18:47.480 --> 18:56.040
forever this salutes for you no that does suck because it is people's jobs and things

18:56.040 --> 19:00.000
but you know this is one of those things that when it was announced i don't know about you

19:00.000 --> 19:03.760
guys but when i heard the news i was kind of like i'm kind of surprised this didn't

19:03.760 --> 19:08.980
happen sooner and i don't mean to sound like insensitive but in this economy when we've

19:08.980 --> 19:13.060
seen what's been happening to studios left and right i was kind of surprised that when

19:13.060 --> 19:17.480
i when i heard this news i was like oh yeah how did this studio that had a game that's

19:17.480 --> 19:22.360
been in development for like 12 years survive as long as they've had you know what i mean

19:22.360 --> 19:27.280
i'm just surprised that take two would keep throwing money at this you know seeing as

19:27.280 --> 19:31.360
there's i mean especially since it's been like 10 years i mean come on i would think

19:31.360 --> 19:36.600
it by now they would be like okay we're gonna pass this on to somebody else or well i guess

19:36.600 --> 19:42.280
maybe they're just you know it's not their game so i don't know well since the word of

19:42.280 --> 19:47.640
the night seems to be reboot doesn't it seem like they've rebooted duke nukem forever internally

19:47.640 --> 19:51.040
several times and we've seen this game kind of develop over the years and what's weird

19:51.040 --> 19:55.960
is that we've seen more media after the game was you know essentially essentially frozen

19:55.960 --> 20:00.440
again here with the closing of 3d realms uh we've seen more on it now and it seems like

20:00.440 --> 20:03.880
it seems that the game reinvented itself over the past few years doesn't it yeah a few times

20:03.880 --> 20:07.620
that's the engines you know were being developed and so i think at one time it was running

20:07.620 --> 20:11.520
on you know one of the quake engines and then you know they ran it on something else and

20:11.520 --> 20:16.600
now it's on it's like something that's like unreal ish but i think it's their own engine

20:16.600 --> 20:22.040
but yeah it's definitely not what it used to be and unfortunately it should have come

20:22.040 --> 20:29.480
out a long time ago but i swear it's elvis well or tupac loki in your you know expert

20:29.480 --> 20:33.560
opinion i use that term loosely what do you think do you think we're ever going to see

20:33.560 --> 20:37.760
this game or is it now officially deader than a doornail we're never going to see it uh

20:37.760 --> 20:40.720
no i think that we'll see this game because take two's got money and they want another

20:40.720 --> 20:46.600
franchise that's going to do well and duke nukem i mean you think the last take two thing

20:46.600 --> 20:52.840
that they've uh or take two game that uh published at 3d realm was a prey this is the last 3d

20:52.840 --> 20:58.080
realm game that they published uh oh and that did not meet expectations either that wasn't

20:58.080 --> 21:04.320
very good but at the same time i mean they actually for what it's worth i enjoyed prey

21:04.320 --> 21:08.200
because prey was a great game for those of us that suck at first-person shooters because

21:08.200 --> 21:12.780
of the fact that you couldn't die and actually prey was kind of epic it just felt like prey

21:12.780 --> 21:17.520
ended very abruptly that was praise biggest detractor but everything leading up to that

21:17.520 --> 21:23.040
point was actually pretty awesome i actually really enjoyed prey well they need to still

21:23.040 --> 21:26.980
have a good first-person shooter franchise because they don't have one right now they

21:26.980 --> 21:32.880
have basically your sandbox games like grand theft auto and red dead revolver those two

21:32.880 --> 21:38.680
franchises they've got their sports games um you know all the 2k sports stuff and also

21:38.680 --> 21:43.400
you know um if they ever do another table tennis game so you've got that but they don't

21:43.400 --> 21:47.240
have a first-person shooter franchise they have their kids lines and stuff like that

21:47.240 --> 21:52.120
like that um you know nickelodeon nick jr stuff but they need a good first-person shooter

21:52.120 --> 21:57.240
thing and what better but you know than duke nukem i mean i think it'd be awesome if they

21:57.240 --> 22:02.360
actually put out a good game and that's the problem is the expectations for are so high

22:02.360 --> 22:07.120
and they want to set like this new precedent for interactivity in the game well that's

22:07.120 --> 22:13.000
good but the game's got to be good also i mean and it's also got to get finished within

22:13.000 --> 22:18.920
timely manner just like fable to fable to oh let's you know make this really amazing

22:18.920 --> 22:24.640
ai you know the dog and all that stuff awesome that i'm glad that you did all that stuff

22:24.640 --> 22:31.480
but the game was still mediocre so come on i don't know let's go to the chat room i've

22:31.480 --> 22:35.360
been um totally ignoring them tonight and i really apologize chat that orange lounge

22:35.360 --> 22:38.800
trader.com of course is always open when we're here uh we're just trying to get used to the

22:38.800 --> 22:42.180
new setup tonight so it's taking me a little longer to get around to them however i want

22:42.180 --> 22:46.160
to read this because it's something what i'm thinking too unfolded raptor in chat says

22:46.160 --> 22:50.960
i heard about prey 2 and it sounded awesome and this news saddens me so come to think

22:50.960 --> 22:55.240
of it that just kind of made me think oh yeah this means prey 2 is is definitely deader

22:55.240 --> 23:00.000
than a doornail right because since the first one didn't do that hot well let's let's say

23:00.000 --> 23:04.160
you know the whole deal with them investing money is that they get rights to this kind

23:04.160 --> 23:08.600
of stuff because obviously you know it they may sell the rights to somebody else you know

23:08.600 --> 23:13.960
because they're no longer around um you know and uh act f pointed out in chat room uh max

23:13.960 --> 23:17.800
pain 3 is another game franchise that they have who's a third person shooter you know

23:17.800 --> 23:22.560
if we're gonna draw straws here but it's not a first person shooter still very good action

23:22.560 --> 23:28.440
franchise but i don't know i think that they they need something like this you know what

23:28.440 --> 23:31.500
take two should do if they're gonna inherit all the rights to all these you know apogee

23:31.500 --> 23:35.480
games and 3d realms they should just give us a new commander keen game how about that

23:35.480 --> 24:00.940
if you're gonna

24:00.940 --> 24:03.480
kind of sucked, you know.

24:03.480 --> 24:04.360
Dr. Sacker?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.020
Well, I was actually going to try and wanted

24:06.020 --> 24:09.120
to make a point earlier about them, you know,

24:09.120 --> 24:10.700
with Duke Nukem Forever.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.100
The other thing they're going to have going for them

24:13.100 --> 24:17.740
to their advantage is, was 10 years now of coverage press

24:17.740 --> 24:19.700
hype?

24:19.700 --> 24:22.140
They could slap out a game that sucks

24:22.140 --> 24:25.020
with the Duke Nukem Forever name on it, and it'll still sell.

24:25.020 --> 24:26.940
And do you think that's what's going to happen?

24:26.940 --> 24:29.220
Do you think that maybe 3D Realms was holding out

24:29.220 --> 24:32.460
for the perfect game, and now Take Two maybe,

24:32.460 --> 24:34.900
and I'm just theorizing here, is going to rush something

24:34.900 --> 24:37.860
out the door based on whatever they get that's just going

24:37.860 --> 24:39.620
to have the Duke Nukem Forever name on it,

24:39.620 --> 24:41.740
just get it out there and say, finally, it's done.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.620
Here, slap.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.540
Well, also you've got to look at Take Two.

24:44.540 --> 24:47.020
I mean, what kind of idiots were running

24:47.020 --> 24:49.900
the whole process of them getting this game done?

24:49.900 --> 24:53.100
Because seriously, usually they have different checkpoints

24:53.100 --> 24:56.260
that they have to make before they get funding for this stuff.

24:56.260 --> 24:59.300
I mean, and how could this go on for 10 years?

24:59.300 --> 25:02.740
$12 million later, how could they just let it go?

25:02.740 --> 25:05.300
I mean, there's got to be some sort of progress being made.

25:05.300 --> 25:09.340
And the fact that over 10 years worth of work

25:09.340 --> 25:10.980
and nothing's out, I'm sorry.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.900
But even Grand Theft Auto IV and all these other big blockbuster

25:14.900 --> 25:18.740
games only took a few years to put out, if that.

25:18.740 --> 25:21.700
So come on, what the hell?

25:21.700 --> 25:22.900
Get a better development team.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.860
Somebody was holding out for perfection,

25:24.860 --> 25:26.060
and it just never arrived.

25:26.060 --> 25:27.180
I guess.

25:27.180 --> 25:27.660
All right.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.900
Well, moving on, let's go into music game worlds,

25:29.900 --> 25:31.740
because it's interesting we talk about source codes

25:31.740 --> 25:33.500
and legal settlements and so on, because there

25:33.500 --> 25:35.740
was some interesting development in the whole Scratch

25:35.740 --> 25:38.940
versus Activision versus this whole thing.

25:38.940 --> 25:42.300
And what happened is that this week an LA Superior Court

25:42.300 --> 25:45.380
judge ordered that the source code for Scratch

25:45.380 --> 25:49.720
the Ultimate DJ must be turned over to Genius and Newmark.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.500
These are the two companies that formed the Scratch the Ultimate

25:52.500 --> 25:53.620
DJ LLC.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.140
There was actually a company, a limited liability court,

25:56.140 --> 25:57.660
formed behind this.

25:57.660 --> 26:00.420
Seven Studios is, of course, now owned by Activision.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.020
They are also going to have to hand over everything

26:03.020 --> 26:04.880
they used to make the game.

26:04.880 --> 26:08.620
Scratch LLC says they are going to finish the game,

26:08.620 --> 26:11.200
and they will continue their lawsuit against Activision

26:11.200 --> 26:11.980
as well.

26:11.980 --> 26:15.100
But the bad news, I'm reading between the lines here,

26:15.100 --> 26:16.340
nothing's been said for sure.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.380
But the bad news is don't expect to see this game

26:18.380 --> 26:21.740
until at least next year now, after all this, probably,

26:21.740 --> 26:22.500
which is too bad.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.620
Because, I mean, at that point, then we're

26:25.620 --> 26:27.740
going to have DJ Hero out there as well.

26:27.740 --> 26:31.220
And is it just going to be oversaturation at that point?

26:31.220 --> 26:33.060
Or is there room for two, like there was room

26:33.060 --> 26:34.300
for Guitar Hero and Rock Band?

26:34.300 --> 26:37.100
There's room for two.

26:37.100 --> 26:39.260
The only real experience I have with DJ Hero

26:39.260 --> 26:42.020
is what I've been reading in Game Informer.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.700
And they do kind of show how the game's

26:43.700 --> 26:46.380
going to play, which is quite different than how

26:46.380 --> 26:47.300
this is going to play.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.340
Because Scratch plays pretty much like Beatmania,

26:49.340 --> 26:52.200
but now they have a more enhanced scratching system

26:52.200 --> 26:53.140
and that kind of stuff.

26:53.140 --> 26:54.740
And you can do a little bit of improv.

26:54.740 --> 26:59.180
But when you look at the two games, clearly,

26:59.180 --> 27:02.260
and I hate to say this, clearly, DJ Hero

27:02.260 --> 27:05.520
is actually kind of changing the way you play the game

27:05.520 --> 27:09.700
and more innovative in that sense.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.300
But I don't know.

27:11.300 --> 27:12.780
I mean, yeah, it does suck.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.840
But at the same time, when we first saw Guitar Hero,

27:15.840 --> 27:18.300
most of us looked at it and went, eh, it's just guitar

27:18.300 --> 27:19.660
freaks, but a little bit different.

27:19.660 --> 27:21.100
I mean, in Scratch the Ultimate DJ,

27:21.100 --> 27:22.740
we kind of look at it and go, eh, it's Beatmania,

27:22.740 --> 27:25.300
but it's hip hop instead of techno music.

27:25.300 --> 27:28.100
So I mean, is that necessarily a bad thing?

27:28.100 --> 27:30.680
Because those first looks can be deceiving, right?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.980
Because Guitar Hero ended up being a pretty awesome game.

27:32.980 --> 27:34.580
Not necessarily a bad thing.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.340
And they might have had a chance if they

27:36.340 --> 27:38.820
could get to market first like they were planning on.

27:38.820 --> 27:41.500
Because if everything had gone as planned,

27:41.500 --> 27:44.980
they would be putting this game out in a couple weeks.

27:44.980 --> 27:47.100
But that's not what happened.

27:47.100 --> 27:51.540
So now you've got this monster of a game coming

27:51.540 --> 27:55.060
from Activision that's due out in October.

27:55.060 --> 27:59.620
And this game is, unless they do some serious miracle working

27:59.620 --> 28:02.180
and haul some ass on getting this game done,

28:02.180 --> 28:04.260
I don't think it's going to be done before it.

28:04.260 --> 28:06.560
That means we're probably not going to see it at E3 either.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.540
But wouldn't it be interesting if we did?

28:08.540 --> 28:10.180
But I'm not going to hold my breath.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.940
They were saying that they were going to have it there,

28:12.940 --> 28:13.580
I thought.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.740
But I don't know.

28:15.740 --> 28:16.860
We'll see what happens.

28:16.860 --> 28:17.900
More to develop, I'm sure.

28:17.900 --> 28:19.020
It seems like some of the new is coming out

28:19.020 --> 28:20.460
on this whole thing every week.

28:20.460 --> 28:23.420
And E3 is just going to be kind of the climax of that.

28:23.420 --> 28:25.460
Because you know DJ Hero is going to be there.

28:25.460 --> 28:27.900
So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.380
But for now, we move on.

28:30.380 --> 28:34.620
And moving on to Guitar Hero 5, where there

28:34.620 --> 28:37.140
have been some details released.

28:37.140 --> 28:41.500
It's to be out on PS2, PS3, Wii, Xbox 360.

28:41.500 --> 28:45.140
No word about new instruments yet.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.980
But they say that it will allow you

28:46.980 --> 28:51.900
to use any combination of instruments, multiple drums,

28:51.900 --> 28:54.180
multiple guitars, different microphones.

28:54.180 --> 28:57.140
So maybe we have a quartet mode.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.420
I don't know.

28:58.420 --> 28:59.460
That would be weird.

28:59.460 --> 29:03.720
So if I wanted to get four singers to sing these songs,

29:03.720 --> 29:04.380
I could do that.

29:04.380 --> 29:06.420
They better all freaking be on pitch,

29:06.420 --> 29:07.820
or I will not listen to them.

29:07.820 --> 29:09.180
Four drummers, too.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.140
I could just have a house full of clacking drums.

29:12.140 --> 29:12.940
That'd be hilarious.

29:12.940 --> 29:13.440
Interesting.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.300
Yes, you could do that.

29:14.300 --> 29:14.940
And great.

29:14.940 --> 29:18.780
There's also another option for party play,

29:18.780 --> 29:22.900
meaning that you can come in and out of the songs as you will.

29:22.900 --> 29:26.660
So it's not going to be the, ah, dropping.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.740
It'll be the, oh, they left.

29:31.620 --> 29:40.260
There's supposed to be the music creation studio to be reworked.

29:40.260 --> 29:45.780
And that you can actually trigger all of your band moments

29:45.780 --> 29:49.740
when you hit parts simultaneously.

29:49.740 --> 29:53.700
And there are some challenges and different things.

29:53.700 --> 29:56.940
I guess they're trying to make it interesting.

29:56.940 --> 30:00.140
On top of that, it will be compatible with Guitar Hero

30:00.140 --> 30:01.120
World Tour.

30:01.120 --> 30:07.780
And you can actually upgrade the old game

30:07.780 --> 30:12.660
to use all the new enhancements in Guitar Hero 5.

30:12.660 --> 30:15.620
They're supposed to also have some Johnny Cash.

30:15.620 --> 30:17.540
That's the best news of all.

30:17.540 --> 30:21.580
INGN0 in chat asks, could you do four singers, four guitarists,

30:21.580 --> 30:22.860
and four drummers?

30:22.860 --> 30:24.260
I don't think all at once.

30:24.260 --> 30:27.020
Any combination of five, I think.

30:27.020 --> 30:27.700
Four, maybe.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.460
Well, maybe five.

30:28.460 --> 30:28.980
I don't know.

30:28.980 --> 30:29.500
I'm sorry, four.

30:29.500 --> 30:29.900
That's right.

30:29.900 --> 30:31.660
Yeah, because there's only four control slots.

30:31.660 --> 30:32.380
I was looking at five.

30:32.380 --> 30:33.820
I think it's a combination of four.

30:33.820 --> 30:36.660
But who knows what's going to be able to be done on the internet?

30:36.660 --> 30:38.820
That'd be kind of neat to have band versus band

30:38.820 --> 30:40.780
at the same time.

30:40.780 --> 30:41.540
Be interesting.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.060
That's a lot of people, though.

30:43.060 --> 30:47.020
Well, have you, well, someone did that without a game.

30:47.020 --> 30:48.540
The YouTube band.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.500
I haven't heard of this.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.500
It's a page that has different embedded YouTube

30:51.500 --> 30:55.820
videos of people playing chords and different passages

30:55.820 --> 30:56.940
in the same key.

30:56.940 --> 30:57.660
Oh, weird.

30:57.660 --> 30:59.660
And you can actually play them all at once

30:59.660 --> 31:00.740
or at different times.

31:00.740 --> 31:03.380
And they're all harmonious.

31:03.380 --> 31:04.100
It's really cool.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.460
I'll try to find the link again.

31:05.460 --> 31:06.060
Gotcha.

31:06.060 --> 31:06.700
OK.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.900
But in theory, you could have it.

31:09.900 --> 31:10.420
OK.

31:10.420 --> 31:11.260
Could be interesting.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.180
Could be interesting.

31:12.180 --> 31:14.540
I'm curious to see how this plays out.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.300
But I bet you, this is just going to, you know,

31:16.300 --> 31:17.700
all the YouTubes you see out there,

31:17.700 --> 31:20.540
speaking of which of people playing Guitar Hero and stuff,

31:20.540 --> 31:22.820
this is just going to up the craziness of those videos.

31:22.820 --> 31:24.100
Because now I can just see it.

31:24.100 --> 31:26.700
We're going to have the four people all singing,

31:26.700 --> 31:28.580
you know, crazy, Journey or whatever.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.620
Then we're going to have just people doing all the mad

31:30.620 --> 31:31.900
drumming, four people at once.

31:31.900 --> 31:34.580
You know you're going to see that expert, everybody in sync,

31:34.580 --> 31:35.900
four people playing video.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.340
It's going to be interesting.

31:37.340 --> 31:39.220
I don't know.

31:39.220 --> 31:40.900
But I don't know if it'll be fun.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.660
That's the real question.

31:42.660 --> 31:43.340
So we'll see.

31:43.340 --> 31:43.900
We'll see.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.500
I'm sure this will also be at E3.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.580
We'll know more about it then.

31:48.580 --> 31:53.740
Well, to make things even more complicated in the DJ game

31:53.740 --> 31:58.620
genre, apparently there's another DJ game coming out.

31:58.620 --> 32:02.220
Armin van Buuren is actually releasing a brand new game

32:02.220 --> 32:06.900
on the Wii called Armin van Buuren in the mix.

32:06.900 --> 32:09.140
And it's due out this fall.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.380
Apparently the developer at Cloud9

32:11.380 --> 32:14.820
is developing the game with him and allow

32:14.820 --> 32:17.660
players to remix his music.

32:17.660 --> 32:18.260
I don't know.

32:18.260 --> 32:19.420
That sounds kind of cheap.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.460
Well, now see, usually I would write this off.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.580
I'd go, eh, it's going to be on the Wii.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.980
It's probably just going to be another one of those cheesy

32:25.980 --> 32:27.220
party games or whatever.

32:27.220 --> 32:30.500
But dude, Armin van Buuren's actually pretty awesome.

32:30.500 --> 32:34.100
So with his name behind it, and granted,

32:34.100 --> 32:36.060
just because you have a big name behind it doesn't

32:36.060 --> 32:37.440
mean the game's going to be good.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.940
But if it's his music and stuff, it

32:39.940 --> 32:43.900
has the potential to be pretty decent.

32:43.900 --> 32:47.260
I mean, it's hard to say with no screenshots and no peripherals.

32:47.260 --> 32:49.740
But the potential's there.

32:49.740 --> 32:52.780
It's just if history has taught us anything,

32:52.780 --> 32:57.380
I think a lot of us have very low expectations,

32:57.380 --> 32:58.900
if you know what I mean.

32:58.900 --> 33:00.020
So we'll see.

33:00.020 --> 33:00.940
We'll see.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.140
Yeah, and a very good point in the chat room.

33:03.140 --> 33:06.140
Tiger Kala says, this is good for trance music.

33:06.140 --> 33:08.380
And that's a good point, too, is that with Scratch,

33:08.380 --> 33:10.060
we're looking at hip hop music.

33:10.060 --> 33:12.700
With DJ Hero, we're looking at mashups.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.020
Maybe this is going to be the game

33:15.020 --> 33:17.200
that the Beatmania fans are drawn towards,

33:17.200 --> 33:19.700
because it's more of the trancey music they're

33:19.700 --> 33:21.340
used to from Beatmania.

33:21.340 --> 33:21.860
Maybe.

33:21.860 --> 33:24.560
With a very big question mark there.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.140
Who knows?

33:25.140 --> 33:26.520
A lot could happen with this game.

33:26.520 --> 33:29.100
But if you think about it, for those folks that

33:29.100 --> 33:31.700
are trying to find a new home, since Konami is not really

33:31.700 --> 33:34.420
doing anything with 2DX in the States,

33:34.420 --> 33:36.500
maybe this Armin Van Buren game is going

33:36.500 --> 33:37.700
to actually be kind of cool.

33:37.700 --> 33:40.700
Do you think we're going to see something like Rock Revolution

33:40.700 --> 33:44.020
but coming out from the Beatmania type of thing?

33:44.020 --> 33:48.100
I am actually tempted to say no, because of how horrifically

33:48.100 --> 33:50.100
Rock Revolution did.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.060
But it depends.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.500
If they put some new creative energy behind it,

33:53.500 --> 33:55.060
it's just they're so retarded now.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.180
It's like, what happened?

33:56.180 --> 33:57.860
I mean, I know what happened.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.860
You got rid of all the people that actually had some ideas

34:00.860 --> 34:03.980
of where to take the whole Bomani genre.

34:03.980 --> 34:05.540
Instead, you got rid of all of them,

34:05.540 --> 34:08.620
and now you're coming out, potentially,

34:08.620 --> 34:13.700
with a collection of older songs, like another Best Hits.

34:13.700 --> 34:14.300
Yeah.

34:14.300 --> 34:15.660
Oh, that takes some thought.

34:15.660 --> 34:16.960
Oh, let's take some old songs.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.580
We don't even have to do shit.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.540
Let's just put it into a new game.

34:20.540 --> 34:21.700
Done.

34:21.700 --> 34:24.420
I'm going to go vacation for the rest of the year.

34:24.420 --> 34:25.420
I don't know.

34:25.420 --> 34:27.980
It is disappointing how the mighty

34:27.980 --> 34:31.460
have fallen in terms of creativity and innovation.

34:31.460 --> 34:34.460
But stranger things have happened.

34:34.460 --> 34:36.020
Let's push some more Frogger games.

34:36.020 --> 34:37.580
That'd be perfect.

34:37.580 --> 34:41.660
Because Frogger, that's a franchise that'll never die.

34:41.660 --> 34:42.700
That's gold right there.

34:42.700 --> 34:45.460
Well, speaking of competition, a lot of talk

34:45.460 --> 34:47.500
has come up this week about the different turntables

34:47.500 --> 34:49.820
between the Scratch game and DJ Hero.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.660
And what's interesting is that if you actually

34:51.660 --> 34:54.860
look at the Scratch turntable, the Scratch turntable

34:54.860 --> 34:56.700
looks somewhat like a BeatMania controller.

34:56.700 --> 34:58.500
Of course, I hope your left side pried,

34:58.500 --> 35:00.020
because that's the direction it looks like it goes.

35:00.020 --> 35:00.460
Ah, that does flip.

35:00.460 --> 35:01.100
Although, does it do it?

35:01.100 --> 35:01.900
It does flip.

35:01.900 --> 35:02.660
Oh, that's good.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.820
But it has five keys on it.

35:04.820 --> 35:07.380
But they're not staggered like you would see on a BeatMania

35:07.380 --> 35:07.900
controller.

35:07.900 --> 35:08.820
They're all in a row.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.500
Kind of looks very much like it looks

35:10.500 --> 35:12.700
like someone ripped off a Guitar Hero controller

35:12.700 --> 35:14.500
and just kind of laid it next to a turntable.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.300
That's what the Scratch turntable looks like.

35:16.300 --> 35:19.540
So don't expect it to look the piano look of BeatMania,

35:19.540 --> 35:20.380
if that makes sense.

35:20.380 --> 35:21.320
It's all in a row.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.820
And otherwise, it looks like there's

35:22.820 --> 35:26.500
a little kind of crossfader, a little switch at the very, very

35:26.500 --> 35:28.420
end as well that's going to be used in the game.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.340
Kind of a bonus thing.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.540
Yeah, basically, the Scratch turntable,

35:31.540 --> 35:35.060
it's got a really nice made turntable.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.300
It's being developed by Newmark.

35:37.300 --> 35:40.300
The platter itself is actually the same type

35:40.300 --> 35:44.820
of platter you'd find on an MP3 turntable.

35:44.820 --> 35:46.400
And that's where people got confused.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.540
They're all, oh, it's a real MP3 turntable.

35:48.540 --> 35:50.780
I can use this as an actual turntable.

35:50.780 --> 35:53.360
No, you can't use it as an actual turntable

35:53.360 --> 35:54.300
for your MP3s.

35:54.300 --> 35:57.380
But it's the same hardware going into it.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.140
And then, of course, the buttons, as you said,

36:00.140 --> 36:01.860
they're all color coded and everything.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.940
Actually, I think that one is the 360 one,

36:04.940 --> 36:07.220
based off of the little x in the corner.

36:07.220 --> 36:08.220
So it has to be the 360.

36:08.220 --> 36:11.060
And so it's color coded to the 360.

36:11.060 --> 36:14.500
And the actual crossfader on the side

36:14.500 --> 36:17.300
is basically for the scratching, for different Scratch

36:17.300 --> 36:18.180
techniques.

36:18.180 --> 36:21.420
So the game plays very similar beat mania type of game.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.540
But the scratching itself, you can do all the Scratch

36:23.540 --> 36:25.900
techniques and all the cutouts and stuff

36:25.900 --> 36:28.940
like that with the crossfader.

36:28.940 --> 36:30.860
That's what that's there for.

36:30.860 --> 36:33.580
Now, earlier this week also, they

36:33.580 --> 36:36.660
had a partial picture of the game.

36:36.660 --> 36:38.580
Can I say that before you move on to DJ Hero?

36:38.580 --> 36:40.120
I just want to remind folks, we talked

36:40.120 --> 36:42.120
about the song list of this game a long time ago.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.980
And Loki had a cutting edge first look at the game

36:44.980 --> 36:46.100
before a lot of people did.

36:46.100 --> 36:49.140
I just want to remind everybody, Milkshake by Kelis

36:49.140 --> 36:50.140
is in this game.

36:50.140 --> 36:52.480
It needs to come out.

36:52.480 --> 36:52.980
That's all.

36:52.980 --> 36:53.540
Potentially in this game.

36:53.540 --> 36:54.020
That is all.

36:54.020 --> 36:54.780
That can all change.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.060
Who knows?

36:55.060 --> 36:56.420
Hopefully they don't lose the licensing

36:56.420 --> 36:57.460
with everything going on.

36:57.460 --> 37:00.820
But come on, your Milkshake will bring all the boys to the yard

37:00.820 --> 37:01.980
if this game comes out.

37:01.980 --> 37:05.200
Now, the DJ Hero controller did put out

37:05.200 --> 37:09.500
some pictures of what looks like the turntable platter

37:09.500 --> 37:12.220
with three color buttons on it.

37:12.220 --> 37:15.260
Now, the picture that went out on the internet

37:15.260 --> 37:19.220
is obviously only half of what actually the controller is.

37:19.220 --> 37:23.740
If you had gotten your latest copy of Game Informer magazine,

37:23.740 --> 37:25.980
they actually did a six page write up on it.

37:25.980 --> 37:28.180
And they actually have a picture of the full turntable

37:28.180 --> 37:29.020
controller in here.

37:29.020 --> 37:32.040
Of course, you've got the turntable as well with the three

37:32.040 --> 37:33.660
buttons on there.

37:33.660 --> 37:38.020
You've also got attached to it is a cross fader as well.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.860
And there's also an effector dial and then

37:39.860 --> 37:41.980
a button that's called the euphoria button,

37:41.980 --> 37:46.420
or basically the overdrive or whatever that you

37:46.420 --> 37:47.780
would have in Guitar Hero.

37:47.780 --> 37:51.820
Now, the way the game's played, similar to Guitar Hero,

37:51.820 --> 37:54.580
you're going to have your icons coming down the screen.

37:54.580 --> 37:57.180
And you've got to hit them with those three buttons.

37:57.180 --> 38:00.980
However, each of those buttons also represents other things.

38:00.980 --> 38:03.360
The green button, which is the farthest on the left,

38:03.360 --> 38:04.600
is going to be the first track.

38:04.600 --> 38:06.060
So anything that you see over there

38:06.060 --> 38:09.100
is going to basically be beats or whatever

38:09.100 --> 38:11.700
that are part of the first track that you're mixing in.

38:11.700 --> 38:14.380
The center is going to be the red, which

38:14.380 --> 38:18.980
is also for effects and stuff that appear on both tracks.

38:18.980 --> 38:21.940
It's also the cue up, I guess, your different effects

38:21.940 --> 38:23.180
that you can throw in there.

38:23.180 --> 38:25.620
And then finally, the blue, which is on the right,

38:25.620 --> 38:28.020
is everything that's on the second song.

38:28.020 --> 38:31.500
Also, the three tracks themselves

38:31.500 --> 38:36.320
have other variations that are going to be coming down.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.180
For example, the green on the far left,

38:39.180 --> 38:43.700
you'll see that the line that follows the track basically

38:43.700 --> 38:46.060
is going to shift back left and right.

38:46.060 --> 38:48.560
And that's where you're going to be doing the cross-fading.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.420
That's your cue to move the cross-fader, kind of like

38:52.420 --> 38:56.780
if you've ever played it, Scratch or was it Crackin' DJ,

38:56.780 --> 38:59.260
very similar to that.

38:59.260 --> 39:02.580
And then also, they've got in the center

39:02.580 --> 39:04.500
is going to cue when you or give you

39:04.500 --> 39:07.000
the cue when you can do the different sound effects

39:07.000 --> 39:09.100
and change your actual effector dial.

39:09.100 --> 39:11.900
And then finally, the far right, the blue,

39:11.900 --> 39:14.780
is going to also have your cues for scratching.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.460
And I think that might also be able to go

39:16.460 --> 39:20.020
on the different tracks altogether.

39:20.020 --> 39:22.380
I'm not sure if it's just limited to those.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.340
But basically, you have to hold down those keys

39:24.340 --> 39:26.980
while you're doing the scratching, cross-fading stuff.

39:26.980 --> 39:30.080
So it's a different style of gameplay

39:30.080 --> 39:32.940
than, say, a Guitar Hero game or Beat Mania.

39:32.940 --> 39:34.940
But it's going to have that kind of same effect.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.500
And then also, all the tracks in the game

39:37.500 --> 39:41.220
are all basically mash-ups, some of the examples

39:41.220 --> 39:42.420
they had in here.

39:42.420 --> 39:45.140
Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc. versus Marvin Gaye,

39:45.140 --> 39:46.460
I heard it through the grapevine.

39:46.460 --> 39:48.540
What?

39:48.540 --> 39:50.220
Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers,

39:50.220 --> 39:53.020
Bustin' Loose versus The Zombies, Time of the Season,

39:53.020 --> 39:56.220
DJ Shadowmix, because DJ Shadow did a lot of stuff

39:56.220 --> 39:57.140
in the game.

39:57.140 --> 40:00.460
David Bowie, Let's Dance versus KRS-One, Jack of Spades,

40:00.460 --> 40:02.380
DJ Shadowmix.

40:02.380 --> 40:07.020
Nirvana, All Apologies versus Rick James, Give it to Me Baby,

40:07.020 --> 40:08.260
the DJ Shadowmix.

40:08.260 --> 40:09.220
What the hell?

40:09.220 --> 40:11.020
This sounds crazy.

40:11.020 --> 40:14.580
Tears for Fears, Shout versus Air Prayids,

40:14.580 --> 40:16.500
Pean Joe or Peano.

40:16.500 --> 40:17.140
Wow.

40:17.140 --> 40:17.900
No, I know what you're talking about.

40:17.900 --> 40:19.060
Yeah, this is a new single.

40:19.060 --> 40:19.940
Yeah.

40:19.940 --> 40:21.420
And then other artists, they've got

40:21.420 --> 40:23.940
BC Boys Back, Blondie, and Billy Squier

40:23.940 --> 40:26.260
are some other confirmed artists in there as well.

40:26.260 --> 40:29.060
But yeah, the game itself, and actually, I take that back.

40:29.060 --> 40:32.060
It looks like the scratching cues are on all three tracks.

40:32.060 --> 40:34.100
But basically, you're going to have two sets of cues

40:34.100 --> 40:36.060
that you're looking for, button presses and then

40:36.060 --> 40:38.580
actions with the crossfader and stuff.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.940
Just seeing how they're going to do this,

40:40.940 --> 40:42.940
I'm actually more excited now about DJ Hero

40:42.940 --> 40:43.780
than I was Scratch.

40:43.780 --> 40:46.820
Because Scratch is basically kind of a fancy beat mania,

40:46.820 --> 40:48.700
but this looks a lot different.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.820
And it's going to be interesting to see what

40:50.820 --> 40:52.100
you're going to be able to do.

40:52.100 --> 40:53.820
Also, they've got two player mode in this

40:53.820 --> 40:56.060
where you can do the guitars in some of the songs.

40:56.060 --> 40:58.560
And you're also going to be able to hook up a microphone to it

40:58.560 --> 41:00.620
if you want to MC over everything.

41:00.620 --> 41:01.460
Wow.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.900
That sounds interesting.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.540
Yeah, so very cool stuff.

41:04.540 --> 41:06.340
They got the right idea with this stuff.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.860
Let's see if we can get this on mic.

41:07.860 --> 41:08.580
Very interesting.

41:08.580 --> 41:10.980
Are you trying to get Shermie to meow on mic for us?

41:10.980 --> 41:11.740
Oh, her purr?

41:11.740 --> 41:13.460
I don't know what the purr will pick up.

41:13.460 --> 41:15.220
That mic's probably not sensitive enough.

41:15.220 --> 41:16.780
No, it's not coming through.

41:16.780 --> 41:18.460
No.

41:18.460 --> 41:19.580
It's not registering.

41:19.580 --> 41:21.160
But we're trying to get a Shermie cameo.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.380
Definitely, definitely.

41:22.380 --> 41:28.780
I'd say, if anything, go to your bookstore, Barnes & Noble

41:28.780 --> 41:29.740
or whatever.

41:29.740 --> 41:32.140
Just pick up a copy of the new Game of War magazine

41:32.140 --> 41:33.300
or just browse through it.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.140
And at least check out the section

41:35.140 --> 41:37.160
that they have on DJ Hero.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.700
It's actually very interesting seeing

41:38.700 --> 41:40.860
as they haven't shown anything really yet for it.

41:40.860 --> 41:43.260
I'm sure we're going to see a lot more out of E3.

41:43.260 --> 41:45.780
And I think it's going to be really fun to check out.

41:45.780 --> 41:47.740
And yeah, it is another thing you've got to buy,

41:47.740 --> 41:48.580
another instrument.

41:48.580 --> 41:51.300
But looking at this, though, I don't

41:51.300 --> 41:53.580
see how they're really going to add anything

41:53.580 --> 41:55.500
to this beyond just the turntable.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.760
And really, you can't play this game two player

41:58.760 --> 42:00.780
with two turntables yet.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.100
Maybe that's for the next game.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.100
Maybe for the next game.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.020
But right now, it's just one turntable, so.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.740
By the way, the chat is saying I'm on crack

42:06.740 --> 42:08.000
and that they could hear the purr.

42:08.000 --> 42:08.580
So there you go.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.120
Sure need to make a cameo on the show.

42:10.120 --> 42:10.620
Yay.

42:10.620 --> 42:12.580
Although no lights came on on the mixing board,

42:12.580 --> 42:13.580
unless I'm looking at it.

42:13.580 --> 42:14.460
Yeah, I saw the move.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.720
Oh, maybe I just, maybe that knob is in the way.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.800
I can't see it very well.

42:17.800 --> 42:18.300
Anyway.

42:18.300 --> 42:19.100
You said knob.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.940
Yeah, I said knob.

42:20.940 --> 42:22.780
Jamie, your knob's in the way.

42:22.780 --> 42:24.540
Anyway, let's move on.

42:24.540 --> 42:26.500
This DJ Hero game sounds pretty cool.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.920
Definitely probably one of the first things

42:27.920 --> 42:28.860
we're going to check out of E3.

42:28.860 --> 42:29.340
I know that.

42:29.340 --> 42:31.220
One of the things, yeah, definitely.

42:31.220 --> 42:32.940
OK, let's move on to some release dates.

42:32.940 --> 42:33.820
Talk about some of the things that are

42:33.820 --> 42:35.020
going to be coming out soon.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.900
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with a trip to the UK?

42:37.900 --> 42:39.700
Well, we have a few things.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.900
On the 19th, Warrior Epic for PC,

42:41.900 --> 42:44.180
and then a bunch of stuff for the 22nd.

42:44.180 --> 42:48.100
Big Family Games on Wii, Terminator Salvation for PC,

42:48.100 --> 42:52.340
UFC 2009 Undisputed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,

42:52.340 --> 42:56.340
Bionic Commando for the same two, Pokemon Platinum for DS,

42:56.340 --> 42:57.740
and Steel Princess.

42:57.740 --> 43:00.500
Is this a typo?

43:00.500 --> 43:01.980
I found a typo.

43:01.980 --> 43:02.820
Why?

43:02.820 --> 43:05.660
Is Steel Princess supposed to be as in the act of theft

43:05.660 --> 43:07.020
or as in metal?

43:07.020 --> 43:08.100
As in the act of theft.

43:08.100 --> 43:10.940
OK, never mind, then it's not a typo.

43:10.940 --> 43:14.620
Yeah, it's supposed to be funny, like that.

43:14.620 --> 43:15.700
OK.

43:15.700 --> 43:17.940
So you just, is that like kidnapping the princess,

43:17.940 --> 43:18.900
or what happens there?

43:18.900 --> 43:21.380
No, I think it's the princess is a thief.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.700
Oh, OK, sort of like Zelda?

43:23.700 --> 43:24.620
I'm going to find out.

43:24.620 --> 43:25.780
Maybe.

43:25.780 --> 43:26.340
That was chic.

43:26.340 --> 43:26.820
Like chic?

43:26.820 --> 43:28.380
Well, you know what I mean, same thing.

43:28.380 --> 43:28.980
Same thing.

43:28.980 --> 43:30.300
Oops, spoiler.

43:30.300 --> 43:30.900
Oops.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.580
Oh, no, I did not know that.

43:32.580 --> 43:35.060
Oh, no, because I've never played Smash Bros. Brawl.

43:35.060 --> 43:38.500
Interesting looking puzzle platformer.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.140
Huh, all right.

43:39.140 --> 43:41.260
And you can have a map maker.

43:41.260 --> 43:42.220
It looks cute.

43:42.220 --> 43:43.460
All right, let's move on.

43:43.460 --> 43:45.500
Traveling the world, how about the US?

43:45.500 --> 43:47.620
US, we've got actually quite a bit of stuff

43:47.620 --> 43:49.500
coming out this week.

43:49.500 --> 43:52.180
On PC, Hinterland Orc Lords.

43:52.180 --> 43:56.780
Never heard of that, but could be good, maybe.

43:56.780 --> 43:58.980
Puzzle Kingdoms on the Wii, that's

43:58.980 --> 44:01.420
a rip off of Puzzle Quest, but it's

44:01.420 --> 44:04.820
done by the same developer, so they're ripping off themselves.

44:04.820 --> 44:06.340
So they're ripping off themselves.

44:06.340 --> 44:07.300
Well, that's OK, right?

44:07.300 --> 44:08.340
Yeah, that's all right.

44:08.340 --> 44:13.060
Bionite Commando on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

44:13.060 --> 44:14.300
No word on PC.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.500
I can't remember if that's coming out at the same time.

44:16.500 --> 44:20.460
Punch-Out this week, big game on the Wii, that'll be fun.

44:20.460 --> 44:23.220
If you're into some movie games, Terminator Salvation.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.820
Is it?

44:24.820 --> 44:25.420
I don't know.

44:25.420 --> 44:27.060
I'm a little skeptical about Punch-Out.

44:27.060 --> 44:27.540
I'm sorry.

44:27.540 --> 44:30.140
I'm derailing the train, but Loki, is it?

44:30.140 --> 44:31.620
Do you really think it's going to be great,

44:31.620 --> 44:33.580
or do you think it's going to be a little cheesy?

44:33.580 --> 44:36.660
I think it's going to be about as good as the first Punch-Out.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.020
I love the first Punch-Out.

44:38.020 --> 44:38.540
Exactly.

44:38.540 --> 44:42.300
And basically, they brought all the graphics up to date,

44:42.300 --> 44:44.820
and they gave you the first Punch-Out again

44:44.820 --> 44:46.660
with some other bells and whistles.

44:46.660 --> 44:47.940
That's all right.

44:47.940 --> 44:48.440
We'll see.

44:48.440 --> 44:48.940
We'll see.

44:48.940 --> 44:50.260
I'm a little skeptical.

44:50.260 --> 44:53.220
I want to demo it before I buy it, that's for sure.

44:53.220 --> 44:57.540
Terminator Salvation coming out on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC,

44:57.540 --> 45:01.420
also done by the same developers as Buy It Commando.

45:01.420 --> 45:04.020
Boom Blocks, Bash Party coming out on the Wii,

45:04.020 --> 45:07.700
kind of a reissue there with extra puzzles.

45:07.700 --> 45:09.780
Tournament Pool coming out on the Wii,

45:09.780 --> 45:12.620
your generic billiards game.

45:12.620 --> 45:13.180
Yu-Gi-Oh!

45:13.180 --> 45:15.980
Stardust Accelerator World Championship 2009.

45:15.980 --> 45:17.700
Here's what Konami's working on.

45:17.700 --> 45:18.580
More Yu-Gi-Oh!

45:18.580 --> 45:20.060
games.

45:20.060 --> 45:21.540
EA Sports Active.

45:21.540 --> 45:23.500
Hey, they sell.

45:23.500 --> 45:26.260
Brand new fitness game from EA, hoping

45:26.260 --> 45:28.580
to capitalize on the whole wheat fit craze.

45:28.580 --> 45:31.600
Although, this does have an elastic resistance band

45:31.600 --> 45:34.340
with it, so you can actually do some pretty good exercises

45:34.340 --> 45:35.060
with it.

45:35.060 --> 45:39.420
Thinking about getting it, but probably won't use it.

45:39.420 --> 45:41.740
Jagged Alliance for the DS.

45:41.740 --> 45:44.300
And talking about an old game ported over.

45:44.300 --> 45:47.460
Rock Band, classic rock track pack coming out

45:47.460 --> 45:49.500
on all four systems.

45:49.500 --> 45:57.100
UFC 2009 Undisputed coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.

45:57.100 --> 46:00.140
Space Camp coming out on DS and on the Wii.

46:00.140 --> 46:00.900
Like the 80s movie?

46:00.900 --> 46:02.740
No, not based off the 80s movie.

46:02.740 --> 46:04.940
Damn it, why can't it be?

46:04.940 --> 46:06.740
I know, that would be an awesome game.

46:06.740 --> 46:10.940
It's just another party game from Activision, sorry.

46:10.940 --> 46:12.940
You can pretend, I guess.

46:12.940 --> 46:16.100
Poochie Poochie Virus coming out on Nintendo DS.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.980
Is that a sexually transmitted disease?

46:17.980 --> 46:18.780
I don't know.

46:18.780 --> 46:20.060
Yeah.

46:20.060 --> 46:21.140
Yu-Gi-Oh!

46:21.140 --> 46:22.260
Don't sleep with her.

46:22.260 --> 46:23.780
She's got Poochie Poochie Virus.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.020
Yeah.

46:25.020 --> 46:25.900
Yu-Gi-Oh!

46:25.900 --> 46:28.740
It's an STD transmitted by Charo.

46:28.740 --> 46:30.940
Yeah, that's what Charo got on the love boat, Poochie Poochie

46:30.940 --> 46:33.460
Virus.

46:33.460 --> 46:36.620
Then we've got Yu-Gi-Oh's 50s Wheelie Breaker.

46:36.620 --> 46:39.620
Yes, see, this and the last game were actually

46:39.620 --> 46:41.660
part of the new Yu-Gi-Oh series.

46:41.660 --> 46:45.020
It's kind of extreme, so they car battle on motorcycles

46:45.020 --> 46:45.900
while racing.

46:45.900 --> 46:50.300
Extreme Yu-Gi-Oh if you're extremely nerdy.

46:50.300 --> 46:51.020
I don't know.

46:51.020 --> 46:53.340
I can't follow the Yu-Gi-Oh stuff.

46:53.340 --> 46:56.180
Never gotten into the card games.

46:56.180 --> 46:58.540
Party Pigs Farmyard Games.

46:58.540 --> 47:01.580
Yes, it's a barnyard themed sports game

47:01.580 --> 47:04.300
from Destineer who puts out all sorts of crap.

47:04.300 --> 47:06.020
And it will give you swine flu.

47:06.020 --> 47:08.500
It probably will.

47:08.500 --> 47:09.540
This is awesome.

47:09.540 --> 47:11.140
The DS, I Love Beauty.

47:11.140 --> 47:13.220
How about a game called Excuse My Beauty?

47:13.220 --> 47:14.580
That's the game I want to say.

47:14.580 --> 47:15.900
Excuse My Beauty.

47:15.900 --> 47:18.220
Excuse My Beauty, officer.

47:18.220 --> 47:19.860
I'll go over to Arizona, I swear.

47:19.860 --> 47:21.420
If you haven't seen that YouTube,

47:21.420 --> 47:23.100
after you're done listening to the show tonight,

47:23.100 --> 47:23.980
please go to YouTube.

47:23.980 --> 47:25.900
Do yourself a favor and look up Excuse My Beauty.

47:25.900 --> 47:27.980
It's the funniest cops you'll ever see.

47:27.980 --> 47:32.700
And coming along with that, Imagine Makeup Artists.

47:32.700 --> 47:33.740
Awesome.

47:33.740 --> 47:37.260
And that's, of course, on the DS.

47:37.260 --> 47:38.540
Because, of course, you need to be

47:38.540 --> 47:42.540
beauty to be excused.

47:42.540 --> 47:45.340
Exactly.

47:45.340 --> 47:48.300
And then we've got some other cool stuff.

47:48.300 --> 47:50.580
The Munchables, which is coming out on the Wii.

47:50.580 --> 47:52.060
This is the game that's from Namco

47:52.060 --> 47:55.020
that's sort of like Katamari, because there's

47:55.020 --> 47:56.700
a lot of games sort of like Katamari.

47:56.700 --> 47:59.860
But you basically are an alien that's

47:59.860 --> 48:02.220
eating these food themed alien invaders.

48:02.220 --> 48:04.780
And as you eat more of them, you get bigger

48:04.780 --> 48:08.700
and you can eat bigger creatures and so on and so forth.

48:08.700 --> 48:09.620
This is kind of neat.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.980
And let's see here.

48:12.980 --> 48:16.740
Finally, oh, actually, that's it.

48:16.740 --> 48:17.260
Great.

48:17.260 --> 48:19.700
Let's move on to Japan now and talk about the Japanese release

48:19.700 --> 48:22.540
dates, where I mispronounce the release names horribly.

48:22.540 --> 48:23.540
Yay.

48:23.540 --> 48:25.180
Actually, this one will be easy, though.

48:25.180 --> 48:26.740
Mass Effect, I can pronounce that.

48:26.740 --> 48:29.940
That comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.

48:29.940 --> 48:31.360
That would be the localized version

48:31.360 --> 48:33.020
of Mass Effect, which, of course, came out here

48:33.020 --> 48:34.180
quite a while ago.

48:34.180 --> 48:36.000
But they've taken some time to make

48:36.000 --> 48:37.220
it special for the Japanese.

48:37.220 --> 48:39.700
And that will finally be making its way out this week.

48:39.700 --> 48:43.160
If you're a PlayStation 3 owner, not a lot for you,

48:43.160 --> 48:46.020
except UFC 2009, undisputed, will make its way

48:46.020 --> 48:49.140
to Asian regions, at least, as does Bionic Commando,

48:49.140 --> 48:51.380
but not technically a Japanese release.

48:51.380 --> 48:53.980
You don't get anything on the PlayStation 3 in Japan

48:53.980 --> 48:55.900
locally until next week.

48:55.900 --> 48:59.180
But on the Nintendo Wii, you have Tact of Magic

48:59.180 --> 49:01.180
is a game you have to look forward to.

49:01.180 --> 49:03.460
It is coming out from Nintendo themselves,

49:03.460 --> 49:04.940
is the game.

49:04.940 --> 49:08.300
It is looking to be some type of RPG.

49:08.300 --> 49:10.980
I'm not sure if it's something else.

49:10.980 --> 49:13.260
It doesn't look like it's based off an anime or anything.

49:13.260 --> 49:16.140
I'm not sure if that's something else here.

49:16.140 --> 49:17.260
Not familiar to you, Loki?

49:17.260 --> 49:18.660
The artwork does not look familiar.

49:18.660 --> 49:20.620
I don't know if it's a new IP or what.

49:20.620 --> 49:24.340
But that is coming out on the Wii from Nintendo, Tact of Magic.

49:24.340 --> 49:27.140
But it may not be an anime right now.

49:27.140 --> 49:29.540
Doesn't mean they won't become an anime later on.

49:29.540 --> 49:31.960
Somebody in the chat room may be able to enhance on that.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.300
Nothing on the PlayStation 2.

49:33.300 --> 49:33.940
Either.

49:33.940 --> 49:36.700
However, the Nintendo DS does see a few releases this week,

49:36.700 --> 49:39.980
including Happy Star Band comes out this week,

49:39.980 --> 49:42.100
as well as some new cases and things for the DS

49:42.100 --> 49:43.420
if that's something you're into.

49:43.420 --> 49:48.820
Another simple DS game this time, series number 48.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.300
Wow.

49:50.300 --> 49:52.220
And then, let's see.

49:52.220 --> 49:57.100
Also, Ora ga Ome o Mamoru comes out this week

49:57.100 --> 50:00.300
from Idea Factory, which is an action game.

50:00.300 --> 50:01.860
Something like Protecting Something?

50:01.860 --> 50:04.260
I Will Protect You is the English translation

50:04.260 --> 50:05.700
of that game.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.860
Comes out this week.

50:07.860 --> 50:10.180
Lastly, looking at the PSP, it looks

50:10.180 --> 50:11.260
to be kind of a slow week.

50:11.260 --> 50:14.940
I don't know if we're getting anything on the PSP this week.

50:14.940 --> 50:18.180
Well, you do get SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.320
And Space Invaders Extreme gets a price cut.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.820
So that's some good news on the PSP.

50:21.820 --> 50:25.740
I bet some folks might even import that SNK Classic 1 that

50:25.740 --> 50:30.660
has King of Fighters 94, King of Monsters, Metal Slug,

50:30.660 --> 50:31.180
Last Resort.

50:31.180 --> 50:33.540
I would hope not, since it's already come out.

50:33.540 --> 50:35.620
So there you go.

50:35.620 --> 50:36.860
Well, there might be at least.

50:36.860 --> 50:38.140
We have a couple listeners in Japan.

50:38.140 --> 50:40.220
Maybe they're going to pick that up for their local version.

50:40.220 --> 50:41.020
We'll see.

50:41.020 --> 50:41.660
There you go.

50:41.660 --> 50:42.660
That's what's coming out in Japan.

50:42.660 --> 50:43.940
Let's get back into some gaming news

50:43.940 --> 50:45.140
before we get to the end of part A

50:45.140 --> 50:46.600
with the classic game of the week.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.300
But first, some news.

50:48.300 --> 50:50.400
Dark Sakura has some exciting news, right?

50:50.400 --> 50:54.060
Well, there is an issue of Nintendo Power

50:54.060 --> 50:59.340
Out that's saying that a particular game that a lot

50:59.340 --> 51:01.860
of people have been importing is going to be coming out

51:01.860 --> 51:05.820
in the US, and that is Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

51:05.820 --> 51:12.380
The issue is saying that it is definitely headed out

51:12.380 --> 51:15.260
that Capcom has been attempting to bring it out

51:15.260 --> 51:16.820
to North America.

51:16.820 --> 51:18.860
But I'm still sort of, I mean, then again,

51:18.860 --> 51:21.140
it's Nintendo's official magazine.

51:21.140 --> 51:21.940
Wait, wait, wait.

51:21.940 --> 51:23.460
Nintendo Power, what's that?

51:23.460 --> 51:25.540
I've never heard of Nintendo Power.

51:25.540 --> 51:26.700
That sounds fake.

51:26.700 --> 51:29.040
Well, maybe people are thinking it's a Photoshop picture.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.700
But I mean, this is going to be proven or disproven

51:30.700 --> 51:33.660
in a couple days when the issue actually comes out, right?

51:33.660 --> 51:36.220
Yeah, I mean, we'll find out for sure.

51:36.220 --> 51:38.620
In fact, it says it's page 46.

51:38.620 --> 51:42.260
So look and see if it's page 46.

51:42.260 --> 51:45.300
I'm looking this over, by the way,

51:45.300 --> 51:48.660
just with a very critical eye.

51:48.660 --> 51:53.500
And let me see if I can't make this a little bit larger.

51:53.500 --> 51:55.500
Well, I mean, what was preventing

51:55.500 --> 51:57.500
the game from coming out here in the first place?

51:57.500 --> 51:58.180
Licensing, right?

51:58.180 --> 51:59.660
Because the licensing in the America

51:59.660 --> 52:01.060
lies with all these different companies.

52:01.060 --> 52:02.580
But if they see the demands there,

52:02.580 --> 52:03.920
they're going to let it come out.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.660
Do you think, though, maybe some characters might get cut?

52:06.660 --> 52:08.780
Maybe that's the sacrifice that'll be made.

52:08.780 --> 52:10.260
That would be unfortunate.

52:10.260 --> 52:11.660
Let's hope not.

52:11.660 --> 52:12.900
I don't know.

52:12.900 --> 52:15.140
From looking at this, it doesn't really

52:15.140 --> 52:18.780
look very Photoshopped to me because of the way

52:18.780 --> 52:20.340
that the glare.

52:20.340 --> 52:25.340
The glare on this is far too uniform to be.

52:25.340 --> 52:28.540
It's either expertly Photoshopped or it's real.

52:28.540 --> 52:29.940
I think it's the real deal, but we

52:29.940 --> 52:32.940
need to be prepared for the fact that some of these characters

52:32.940 --> 52:33.980
might be cut.

52:33.980 --> 52:35.860
But that could be good news for some people

52:35.860 --> 52:36.700
because that means they might get

52:36.700 --> 52:38.500
replaced with additional Capcom characters.

52:38.500 --> 52:39.220
Who knows?

52:39.220 --> 52:41.720
I mean, I think we should be prepared to see the character

52:41.720 --> 52:43.660
roster possibly shift slightly.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.860
But we'll see, right?

52:45.860 --> 52:46.500
That we will.

52:46.500 --> 52:50.500
But I'm honestly putting my money on this being legit.

52:50.500 --> 52:51.020
Good.

52:51.020 --> 52:52.740
And now I have to import it.

52:52.740 --> 52:53.580
Hooray.

52:53.580 --> 52:55.340
It's too bad this isn't coming out instead.

52:55.340 --> 52:56.980
What's that?

52:56.980 --> 53:00.140
Someone's photoshopped Kellogg's versus Capcom.

53:00.140 --> 53:01.140
The new age of breakfast.

53:01.140 --> 53:01.940
I've seen that.

53:01.940 --> 53:03.700
Now that would be a game I'd like to play.

53:03.700 --> 53:04.380
That would be a lot of fun.

53:04.380 --> 53:05.180
I would play that.

53:05.180 --> 53:05.980
That was all right.

53:05.980 --> 53:08.020
Tony the Tiger would throw down.

53:08.020 --> 53:10.740
Snap, Crackle, Pop would do like a team attack.

53:10.740 --> 53:13.140
Anyway, moving on.

53:13.140 --> 53:14.920
Moving on.

53:14.920 --> 53:16.500
Some other interesting things.

53:16.500 --> 53:17.300
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

53:17.300 --> 53:18.140
Can I say that real quick?

53:18.140 --> 53:18.300
Yeah.

53:18.300 --> 53:20.020
But you said this before the show tonight, Loki.

53:20.020 --> 53:21.900
We were actually talking about this Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

53:21.900 --> 53:23.700
You said maybe this is something Nintendo

53:23.700 --> 53:26.580
was trying to keep under wraps until E3 to go, see,

53:26.580 --> 53:29.380
core gamers, we heart you.

53:29.380 --> 53:31.260
I'm sure it was.

53:31.260 --> 53:35.220
But as all things with E3, they never stay under wraps.

53:35.220 --> 53:37.700
Because if you tell somebody, they'll

53:37.700 --> 53:40.420
tell somebody untrustworthy.

53:40.420 --> 53:42.060
Like us.

53:42.060 --> 53:43.260
Yes.

53:43.260 --> 53:45.540
Hey, except we're trustworthy sometimes.

53:45.540 --> 53:46.660
When we want to be, yeah.

53:46.660 --> 53:48.180
When we want to be.

53:48.180 --> 53:51.780
Anyways, Pokemon Gold and Silver are being remade.

53:51.780 --> 53:54.860
And that's not a huge surprise.

53:54.860 --> 53:56.860
But yeah.

53:56.860 --> 54:00.380
No time frame, I guess, other than the fact

54:00.380 --> 54:02.660
that it's supposed to be in Japan this fall

54:02.660 --> 54:05.580
and probably coming out here sometime in the spring.

54:05.580 --> 54:09.380
If I remember correctly, the last two games we had it,

54:09.380 --> 54:14.340
like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Time,

54:14.340 --> 54:15.780
and I forget the other one was.

54:15.780 --> 54:21.660
Anyways, those were both around April, so that'd be spring.

54:21.660 --> 54:24.300
I don't know.

54:24.300 --> 54:26.260
Pokemon's just not my thing.

54:26.260 --> 54:27.380
It's just really not.

54:27.380 --> 54:30.100
I think I'm out of the age bracket for that.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.580
I'm kind of over it, but I'm a little disappointed

54:32.580 --> 54:34.820
it's yet another remake.

54:34.820 --> 54:35.460
I don't know.

54:35.460 --> 54:37.620
I would kind of like to see one of these games on the Wii.

54:37.620 --> 54:38.580
Have you run out of ideas?

54:38.580 --> 54:39.100
I mean.

54:39.100 --> 54:41.180
I would like to see one of these games on the Wii.

54:41.180 --> 54:43.460
And I understand Pokemon was born as a handheld

54:43.460 --> 54:45.700
or what have you, but I don't know.

54:45.700 --> 54:47.980
Or just give us a Pokemon MMO already.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.940
I mean, Pokemon was born to be an MMO.

54:50.940 --> 54:52.180
Couldn't it?

54:52.180 --> 54:53.540
Maybe I'm crazy.

54:53.540 --> 54:55.500
I don't know.

54:55.500 --> 54:59.700
Anyhow, moving on, another game that I guess some were born

54:59.700 --> 55:02.500
to play on the Nintendo Wii, Contra.

55:02.500 --> 55:05.220
It's a brand new version of Contra called Contra Rebirth.

55:05.220 --> 55:07.300
And if you're in Japan, this game already came out.

55:07.300 --> 55:08.700
It came out on May 12.

55:08.700 --> 55:11.500
It was released in Japan for $10.

55:11.500 --> 55:13.860
It's awesome.

55:13.860 --> 55:15.700
Have you heard?

55:15.700 --> 55:16.580
I haven't heard.

55:16.580 --> 55:18.080
Tell us a little bit what the game's like.

55:18.080 --> 55:18.780
No, it's awesome.

55:18.780 --> 55:23.700
It's very 16-bit Contra-ish, but they've

55:23.700 --> 55:25.660
got a bunch of crazy ass levels in there.

55:25.660 --> 55:28.340
Like there's one where you're skydiving

55:28.340 --> 55:31.180
on parts of a broken spaceship and stuff

55:31.180 --> 55:34.500
like that, fighting monsters, and all the typical stuff

55:34.500 --> 55:37.100
that you would see in a Super Nintendo Contra game.

55:37.100 --> 55:39.660
But awesome.

55:39.660 --> 55:42.580
Well, the game does have co-op, just like the original Contra,

55:42.580 --> 55:44.860
but no word yet on when it's going to come out over here

55:44.860 --> 55:46.060
on this side of the ocean.

55:46.060 --> 55:48.700
But I would imagine it's going to come out soon.

55:48.700 --> 55:51.140
Probably just a little bit of localizing time.

55:51.140 --> 55:55.020
Going to chat for some comments, Tora is in chat tonight

55:55.020 --> 55:57.280
and is commenting on the Pokemon story, saying,

55:57.280 --> 56:00.980
Rob, the creators already said Pokemon will never be an MMO.

56:00.980 --> 56:02.260
Well, you know what?

56:02.260 --> 56:03.860
Never say never.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.420
Yeah, pass enough money their way,

56:05.420 --> 56:06.820
and they'll be like, whatever.

56:06.820 --> 56:07.420
Exactly.

56:07.420 --> 56:09.300
Just like, didn't everybody say just a few weeks ago,

56:09.300 --> 56:12.580
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom would never come out in the US, right?

56:12.580 --> 56:15.100
Never say never.

56:15.100 --> 56:16.500
But I mean, I get the point.

56:16.500 --> 56:18.420
But you know, where there's money.

56:18.420 --> 56:22.420
Didn't they also say there'd never be another Katamari game?

56:22.420 --> 56:24.460
Yeah, we saw how long that lasted.

56:24.460 --> 56:25.500
So we'll see.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.300
Technically, it's not new.

56:27.300 --> 56:27.940
I get it.

56:27.940 --> 56:29.700
It's a snowball's chance in hell.

56:29.700 --> 56:31.200
But there's a chance.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.980
There's a chance.

56:32.980 --> 56:35.100
Just a few more stories for you guys

56:35.100 --> 56:37.020
before we get to a little break here tonight.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.100
But first, our Sakura.

56:38.100 --> 56:39.100
Do we get to break things?

56:39.100 --> 56:40.140
Actually, no, not in my house.

56:40.140 --> 56:41.380
Actually, we're at your house.

56:41.380 --> 56:42.460
So yeah, tonight we can.

56:42.460 --> 56:44.060
Let's start with the Dalek up there.

56:44.060 --> 56:49.940
No.

56:49.940 --> 56:50.440
See?

56:50.440 --> 56:50.940
Stop.

56:53.580 --> 56:55.980
That's our new mascot, by the way, is Dalek Sec.

56:55.980 --> 56:58.060
Because the ferret's at the OLR Studios, so.

57:03.580 --> 57:04.660
See?

57:04.660 --> 57:05.180
Anyway.

57:05.180 --> 57:05.820
Oh, god.

57:05.820 --> 57:07.740
Doesn't quite have the charm of the ferret.

57:07.740 --> 57:16.620
Not quite as charming as the ferret.

57:16.620 --> 57:17.540
I had to.

57:17.540 --> 57:18.220
Kind of annoying.

57:18.220 --> 57:20.260
I kind of wish I could be exterminated for real.

57:20.260 --> 57:21.140
Anyway.

57:21.140 --> 57:26.220
So new game coming out for the iPhone, which makes me happy

57:26.220 --> 57:27.620
because it's one of my favorites,

57:27.620 --> 57:29.460
and I have to think about getting it now,

57:29.460 --> 57:32.220
is Dick Doug Remix.

57:32.220 --> 57:36.780
It is out for $5.99 on the iTunes App Store.

57:36.780 --> 57:42.100
And you have a D-pad and a flick mode.

57:42.100 --> 57:47.620
The flick will let you fling dirt around

57:47.620 --> 57:50.700
by flicking your finger on the screen and what?

57:50.700 --> 57:53.100
I'm just laughing at the concept of taking dirt around

57:53.100 --> 57:55.100
with your finger.

57:55.100 --> 57:57.860
Now with enhanced moving dirt technology.

57:57.860 --> 57:59.780
And you have enhanced shovels so you

57:59.780 --> 58:03.700
can dig faster and balloon blocks to protect you

58:03.700 --> 58:05.180
from falling rocks.

58:05.180 --> 58:08.820
And hey, it looks pretty fun.

58:08.820 --> 58:13.460
It's definitely got big air pumping power.

58:13.460 --> 58:15.860
So yay.

58:15.860 --> 58:19.340
The chat room is commenting on the Dalek being a new mascot.

58:19.340 --> 58:21.380
Brad from Pod Culture is suggesting

58:21.380 --> 58:23.940
Capcom versus Dalek versus ferret.

58:23.940 --> 58:25.980
And Act F adds on to that versus Clicky.

58:25.980 --> 58:29.340
So somebody needs to hit up Mujin quick.

58:29.340 --> 58:33.060
We'll just dump Shermie on them and they'll all die.

58:33.060 --> 58:33.620
All right.

58:33.620 --> 58:36.380
Shermie will cute them to death.

58:36.380 --> 58:38.100
He'll purr them to death.

58:38.100 --> 58:39.380
All right, moving on.

58:39.380 --> 58:41.540
Loki, what do you got for us?

58:41.540 --> 58:44.860
Well, I've got some interesting information.

58:44.860 --> 58:48.500
Of course, right around the corner, we've got BlizzCon.

58:48.500 --> 58:52.100
And I really heard this week tickets went on sale.

58:52.100 --> 58:55.700
And of course, they sell out very fast.

58:55.700 --> 58:59.660
And this probably is not helping slow that down any.

58:59.660 --> 59:03.780
But Blizzard has confirmed that the special pet

59:03.780 --> 59:05.700
you will get for attending BlizzCon

59:05.700 --> 59:10.340
will be the Grunty the Marine Murloc.

59:10.340 --> 59:12.620
Yes, it's Murloc dressed up like one of the Space

59:12.620 --> 59:16.300
Marines from StarCraft.

59:16.300 --> 59:19.100
And there are people that will pay lots of money for it.

59:19.100 --> 59:20.660
Yes, in fact, some of the tickets

59:20.660 --> 59:23.980
have already gone out on eBay already,

59:23.980 --> 59:25.380
which is not a surprise.

59:25.380 --> 59:27.700
And hopefully you were there early

59:27.700 --> 59:30.020
to get your tickets for the first round

59:30.020 --> 59:32.780
because they sold out within 30 minutes.

59:32.780 --> 59:33.820
I didn't talk to Extifer.

59:33.820 --> 59:34.940
I didn't see if he got his ticket.

59:34.940 --> 59:36.300
I know he was trying to go.

59:36.300 --> 59:37.660
I don't think he's going to go.

59:37.660 --> 59:40.220
He said he didn't want it because the tickets are $125

59:40.220 --> 59:40.500
now.

59:40.500 --> 59:42.020
Oh, dang.

59:42.020 --> 59:42.580
Wow.

59:42.580 --> 59:43.460
Yeah.

59:43.460 --> 59:45.500
And he was trying to get me to go.

59:45.500 --> 59:48.020
But he doesn't want me to go to Penny Arcade Expo.

59:48.020 --> 59:49.640
He says I should go to BlizzCon instead.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.820
But dude, Seattle.

59:51.820 --> 59:55.140
And Penny Arcade Expo is kind of awesome.

59:55.140 --> 59:57.060
BlizzCon's too limiting for me.

59:57.060 --> 59:59.340
But if you can't afford to go to BlizzCon

59:59.340 --> 01:00:01.540
and you don't get a ticket, you can, however,

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.660
for the first time, watch the event on DirecTV

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.900
or online for $39.99.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.300
So I should pay an additional $40 to the company.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.540
I'm already paying $15 a month too.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.540
Hey, well, if you want to see all the stuff that

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.660
will be covered probably on other press sites.

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:20.300
It will be on the internet in 30 seconds

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.740
after it's on this channel.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.580
Wow Insider, one of those wow sites.

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.660
There's a billion of them out there.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.740
Not even 30 seconds.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.260
They will be live blogging that shit.

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.300
Have you ever noticed that all the top podcasts right now

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.100
on iTunes, like if you look at gaming, almost half of them

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:34.780
are Warcraft podcasts.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.580
I'm like, dude, if we wanted to be super famous,

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.320
we'd just talk about Warcraft all the time.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.780
Because that's apparently what makes

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.020
you popular on the internet.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.940
Just kind of surprised me.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:47.240
I thought it would be way too saturated for Warcraft podcasts.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.380
But they do very well.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.620
Which, by the way, reminds me, be kind.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.940
Rate us a five in iTunes.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.380
They have a new rating system now.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.780
Even if you've written a review for the show,

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.220
you can go back and rate the show five stars.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.500
And by the way, thanks so much to those

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.620
that have already done it.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.580
Because we are on page one right now of the podcast.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.100
That makes us very happy.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.700
Because word of mouth's all we got

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.940
to spread the word of the show.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.220
So that's all we ask.

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.900
Thank you.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.860
So let's see.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.700
Tora, by the way, in chat is mentioning something

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:22.620
about Nintendo Power and the whole Capcom vs. Tatsunoko

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:23.140
thing.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:23.860
Let me read this.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.900
My ex has scans of the Nintendo Power talking

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.660
about Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.140
There's three characters missing from the roster.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.420
Two of them don't have licensing over here in the States.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.060
He's sending them to me now, ha ha.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.580
So that doesn't surprise me at all.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:36.840
That's kind of what we were saying earlier,

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.380
is that prepare that there might be some roster changes.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.700
But they'll try to sell it to you.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.780
They'll add more stuff back in.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.420
We'll see.

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.660
We'll see.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:46.380
OK.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.980
Anyhow, so BlizzCon.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:48.820
Yeah, I don't know.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.320
I think I'm going to pass this year in favor of just reading

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.360
about it on the internet.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.940
There's $125 for a pet or even $40 for the pet.

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:57.660
No, thank you.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:02.420
I mean, wow is cool and all, but it's not that cool.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.020
Also, what is that cool?

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.100
You know who is that cool?

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.100
Steve Weeby.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.100
He is that cool.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:12.060
And some companies are willing to pay more than $40

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.260
in the name of Steve Weeby.

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.780
In fact, Stride Gum apparently is

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:21.060
going to be spending $10,001 in quarters.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:24.980
That's a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum,

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:27.180
is their little tagline for Stride Gum,

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.300
if Steve Weeby accomplishes the task

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.540
of taking over the Donkey Kong world record at this year's E3.

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.700
So apparently, what's going to happen,

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.140
the reward will be paid.

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:41.980
If Weeby does beat Billy Mitchell's record score,

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.060
then apparently Stride is going to provide him

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:48.340
with a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.780
and $10,001 in quarters.

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.460
Huh.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.620
So I have the names of the people cut

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.500
from Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.940
Oh, who's that?

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:03.860
It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.940
Hm, there they are.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.100
Well, you know, again, it was probably a licensing thing,

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.900
but does this mean maybe Capcom characters will replace them

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.420
or just get used to it?

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.700
I didn't hear who.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.860
I said Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.060
So what are you QQing about over there, Darusakura?

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.820
Dude, Joe's awesome.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.580
All right, more to come on the whole King of Kong debacle,

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.100
which still goes on to this day at E3.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.980
But for now, more news.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.540
There's a game that I have been banging myself in the head

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:42.140
over trying to make myself understand and remember

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.620
that much Japanese to be able to play it properly.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.220
And I've kind of hit an impasse.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.580
But Ragnarok DS.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.100
Well, thankfully, I won't have to give myself a migraine

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.260
every time I try to play it.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.020
And it's a fun game, don't get me wrong.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.540
I love it.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.420
I'm all like, yeah.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:05.180
But XSeed is having a match-up with Gung Ho Works

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.780
to bring Ragnarok Online DS out in the winter.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.460
So that makes me happy.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.980
Pourings for all, yay.

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:15.020
I just know the first town you have to go

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.940
is Prontera, just to let you know.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.980
But I love the game.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.100
And especially for people who, like me,

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.580
have been playing RO for like ever.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.300
Addict.

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.100
I haven't touched the game in a month and a half, Rob.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.580
I haven't touched WoW a lot lately.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.540
You'd be proud of me.

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.180
Well, I've just been so busy.

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.660
It's not that I don't want to play WoW.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.340
I just kind of had other stuff going on.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.700
I've had way too much to do.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:42.740
But the whole part of the game, the story of the game

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.500
is that you play a guy named Ares, who meets this girl.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.580
And she's a job class that does not exist in the game at all.

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.900
But she's there.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.980
And you have to, she's lost her memory.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.140
And you have to help her, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:02.300
You can change the rest of your job and everything.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:08.020
But it's pretty much RPG with RO flavor.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.180
Now, Death Wishing in Chat at chat.orangetraday.com,

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.940
live on this Sunday night, is sharing

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.780
that he could never get into Ragnarok.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:19.180
Because there was no quest, and he likes quest-based MMOs.

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:21.540
So does this DS game kind of add the whole quest element?

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.940
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.020
They're not being quests.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.340
Because there's quests aplenty in RO.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.500
Is that something they added later?

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.780
Because it seems like when I was playing like years ago,

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:32.300
they didn't have them.

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.740
Rob, you were playing with me in the beta.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.020
I know.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:34.740
It was years ago.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.100
So they have them now, though.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.940
Yeah, dude, there's even a quest.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.980
And it's like a really simple, easy, stupid quest

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.980
where you get a bajillion experience points just

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.180
for doing it.

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:47.100
And you've got the ones that give you experience points,

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.780
the ones questing for items.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.180
Especially the questing for items,

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:54.060
that's how you get some of the really rare crap in the game.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:56.420
I have to admit, there's a tiny, tiny part of me,

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.940
just very, very tiny, but a tiny, tiny part of me

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.940
that kind of wants to go back and check out RO.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.940
Play on the server I play on.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:03.500
But there's also a tiny, tiny part of me

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.220
that wants to do the same for Final Fantasy XI.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.420
Play on the server I play on.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.220
But I also know my guildies in WoW

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.700
would kill me in the face if I did something like that.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.580
And I don't want to be killed in the face.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.460
Play Ragnarok with me.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.420
It's free.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:14.940
We'll see.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.580
Play on the server I play on.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.620
We'll see.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:18.940
I don't have time for more crack right now.

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.380
I'm a busy boy.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:20.900
We'll see.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.100
Maybe after E3 when things settle down a little bit.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.380
We'll see.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.340
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.740
Then we got the Classic Game of the Week coming up.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.740
Well, the Classic Game Flashback is now

01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:36.700
available on the App Store for your iPhone or iPod Touch.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.620
However, there's something a little interesting about it.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.260
The game itself is $4.99.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:48.100
And it's basically a port of the Amiga version.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:53.460
However, apparently Pocket Gamer has done a report on the game.

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:57.260
And they said that basically you're paying for an emulator.

01:06:57.260 --> 01:07:01.940
And then the ROM is downloaded independently

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:03.700
using the emulator, I guess.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:08.140
And so because of that, it's not exactly designed for the iPhone.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:12.940
And it's kind of wonky as far as the controls go.

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.020
Uh-oh.

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.180
Another Mega Man 2.

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.460
Yeah, I was going to say, sadly, there's

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.660
been a couple of those on the iPhone,

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.620
hasn't there, where there have been emulators.

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.740
Not just on the iPhone.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.500
You kind of get the sense that maybe on Xbox Live

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.260
you get a lot of that too, where it's just

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.740
you're basically paying $5 for an emulator in the ROM.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.420
Well, hell, that is what you're paying for on the Wii.

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:31.620
But it's a little different.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.700
Because Nintendo put out the Wii and Nintendo

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.540
put out all those games.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.820
So a little different.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.780
Anyhow, one more story for you guys.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.980
And it has to do with a really funny guy.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.780
I don't know if you ever watched The Soup, which is a show on E,

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.880
but it's awesome.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.540
It's hosted by a guy named Joel McHale, who's pretty funny.

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.580
And yes, this does tie into video games.

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:52.680
Because Joel McHale is apparently

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:56.100
going to be giving the Ubisoft press conference this year

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.420
at E3.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.380
Interesting.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:02.100
He also was appearing live in LA that same week.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:02.740
Oh, funny.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.140
On the 6th.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.900
Or wait, wherever that Friday is.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.820
Well, I'm sure that show tapes in LA too.

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.860
So it's probably just roll out of bed and into the show

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.140
for him, you know what I mean?

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.420
So that's pretty cool, though, that he's

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.980
going to be doing that E3.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.560
Apparently, you will be able to watch the whole thing yourself

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.220
the next day.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.420
It will be available on Ubisoft's website.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.260
That's pretty cool.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.180
I plan on doing it.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.060
Absolutely.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.500
If we can't get tickets in person,

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.380
because they hating on the independent media.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:30.820
I think that's actually the day before I arrive.

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:32.580
Oh, bummer.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.540
Bummer, bummer.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.140
All right, it's time.

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.140
We're finally going to get into the classic video

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:37.800
game of the week.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.100
That's right.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.760
We'd like to take some time on the show

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.900
every week to dig into the archives.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.140
And Dark Soccer digs into her vault.

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.180
And now I have seen the vault. It's a very impressive vault.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.900
And she pulls out one game that she

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:50.780
thinks you guys should pay some respect to.

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:54.340
So it's time to pay me tribute.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.180
Pay her tribute.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.420
Pay her classic game tribute.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.380
The classic of the week.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.540
What should the kids be playing this week, Dark Soccer?

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.580
Pac-Man.

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.980
Well, now that's a classic.

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.220
Yeah.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.780
And actually, it was suggested to me by Sauce.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:10.900
So I thought it was actually very, very, very a good one

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.560
to put in there.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.940
And really, a whole year plus of doing this segment,

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:15.300
and you've never done Pac-Man.

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:15.820
Amazing.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:16.320
Nope.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.100
This is Pac-Man.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.300
Basically, if you don't know how to play Pac-Man,

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.420
then you've been living with your head under the dirt

01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:28.900
forever.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.020
For decades.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.140
Basically, it's a maze game.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.860
You play as a little circular guy

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:36.300
who runs around eating dots.

01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:37.980
And he's chased by ghosts.

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:42.020
And if you eat a big dot, you can chase the ghost.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.100
Did you get Chermey to talk?

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:47.140
Hey, baby.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:47.900
Hey, radio.

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:48.400
Not kiddie.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.460
Yeah, Chermey on mic now.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.980
So anyway, really what I wanted to bring up

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.140
about this is the Pac-Man franchise,

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.140
which has gone kablooey.

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:07.380
Also, it is possible to get a perfect game of Pac-Man,

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.260
but it was only done by the world's biggest asshole, Billy

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:13.100
Mitchell.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:19.860
And there also was an eight-year-old boy

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:25.180
who, in 1982, made it through the split screen level, which

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:32.340
is basically what happens when it basically gets over more

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.700
than what the memory of the game can handle,

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.500
because it just basically recalculates every time

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.160
it goes through.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:43.820
So the game was actually made by Namco, brought up

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.500
by Midway in America.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:50.060
And the way that the name of the game

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:55.580
came around was from a Japanese phrase, paku paku taberu.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.820
Paku paku is the sound the mouth makes

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:03.820
when open and closed right away.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.020
I never do that.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:11.100
So basically, and taberu is to eat.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.860
So basically, the character is supposed

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.780
to sort of look like pizza, missing a piece.

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:26.180
So as it came out, it went kind of meh in Japan.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:29.420
But when Midway grabbed it over here,

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.780
it was totally, totally, totally explosive.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.820
It went crazy.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.180
And everyone liked it, because all they really had before

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.620
was Space Invaders, that realm.

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:44.580
Yeah, the music's getting a little monotonous here.

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.180
So I thought maybe we could switch it up a little bit,

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.100
and I'll play something else for the Classic Game of the Week

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:49.620
here.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.780
Well, we can play a little bit of background music here.

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.580
OK, anyway.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:08.060
So also, since Pac-Man made it really, really happy over here,

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:12.420
that also we're able to bring out a few other games,

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:16.460
like Rally-X. And Pac-Man actually

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:20.660
even surpassed Asteroids as the best-selling arcade

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.540
game of all time when it was released.

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:30.140
So basically, we can just say that Pac-Man was,

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:35.820
I want to say, the game that really propelled video games

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.020
more closer to the mainstream, apart from just

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.700
being something for kids.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.020
I remember being little and seeing adults playing it.

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:45.100
I remember playing Pac-Man on roller skates.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.060
Yes, Pac-Man on roller skates.

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.100
I remember roller skating to this song

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.060
that's playing in the background right now.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.100
That was hardcore.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.980
Well, also, I have somewhere in the vault,

01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:00.180
or actually not in the vault, in the garage, a Pac-Man plushie

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.540
with the little ghost in his mouth

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.380
wearing a t-shirt and everything that came out in the 80s.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.820
You know, I had Pac-Man glasses, the glasses

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.740
that they had at Burger King, or was it?

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.540
You remember those?

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.380
I had the Pac-Man board game.

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.420
I remember that.

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.100
And I seem to recall there was Pac-Man cereal,

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.500
if I'm not mistaking.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.740
And I'm pretty sure I had that, too.

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.340
Well, I'll tell you something else

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.060
that this might be interesting.

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:25.340
In Japan, it was actually called Pac-Man.

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.540
And they changed it to Pac-Man because they

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:30.420
were afraid that vandals were going to change the P to an F,

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.100
so it would be Pac-Man.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:32.740
That's awesome.

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:33.940
You can still find Pac-Man.

01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:36.980
I'm not sure they did in ROMs somewhere.

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.480
Sure.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.500
You can still find Pac-Man machines in Europe,

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.380
apparently.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:46.420
I want a Pac-Man machine.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.620
Now, let's go ahead and talk about sequels.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.140
Well, actually, the different ports.

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:55.940
There was the Apple II series, Atari 2600, Atari 5200,

01:13:55.940 --> 01:14:00.340
the 8-bit computers, IBM, the early IBM PC, and television

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.420
Commodore 64 NES.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.340
On handheld, we had Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.500
Color, which I have.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.700
Actually, I've got so many versions of this damn game.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.940
Christ, it's only a three-hour show, you know.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.900
There were just all the different versions.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.940
And, of course, we have them all in the Namco Museum,

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:18.020
Xbox Live Arcade.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:21.420
We've got the Championship Edition.

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:29.900
My favorite to this date is the one on GameCube.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:30.820
Hi, baby.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.740
Sorry, it's my cat.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:37.740
Where you play as the ghost.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.580
Stop trying to get your cats to talk during the segment.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.380
Where you play as the ghost trying to catch Pac-Man.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.620
That one was pretty fun.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:49.540
So, since then, and by the way, I love the little flashing

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:53.460
thing on this article, because the Atari 2600 version sucked.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.260
Sucked.

01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.580
Sorry.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.340
Yeah, I do have it.

01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.620
Sequels.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.180
Dude, do we have spin-offs and sequels?

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:07.580
We have Ms. Pac-Man, which Ms. Pac-Man was great.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.940
Um, Super Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, Junior Pac-Man, Pac and

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.620
Pal, Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.900
I think Chomp Chomp was his dog, wasn't it?

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.460
We have Professor Pac-Man, which was an unauthorized one

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.860
that Midway created.

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:26.820
Pac-Land, which I've actually got on the PC Engine duo.

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.940
By the way, this is for you, DarkSakura.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.820
This is just for you here.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:31.420
If I can get to it.

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.300
Is it a 7-Up commercial?

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.940
No.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:35.060
Even worse.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.980
Far worse.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:41.140
Oh, fuck.

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:43.740
That's the Atari 2600 version.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.420
Has everybody's ears bleed?

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:49.860
We had Pac-Mania, which is actually a really, really good

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:50.980
follow-up game.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.900
Pac-Man VR, Pac-Man Arrangement, which was in the

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.780
Namco Classics Volume 2.

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.540
Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga Class of 81, Pac and Party.

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:04.140
Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Frogger Classic Combo, Pac-Man 25th

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.060
Anniversary, and then Pinball.

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:09.220
We had Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man, which was created specifically

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:09.900
by Midway.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.740
And we had Baby Pac-Man, another unauthorized one,

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.340
which is a game I really want in the collection, even though

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:20.100
it kind of sucks ass to play, because it's a combination

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.420
pinball video game.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:24.260
It actually, I think, was one of the inspirations, I want

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.660
to say, eventually, for what gave us the

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.900
Pinball 2000 franchise.

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.740
Also for console, we had Pac-Attack, Pac-Man 2, Pac in

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:35.820
Time, Pac-Man World, Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness.

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:37.380
Dude, there's so many different ones.

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:43.980
Pac-Man Carnival this year, multiple home versions, all

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.220
kinds of stuff.

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.100
So yeah, we have had.

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:51.120
I would have to say that my favorite Pac-Man game in the

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:56.580
series, overall, just as far as fun to play, is Super Pac-Man.

01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.180
That's what I was just loading up right now.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.260
I love Super Pac-Man.

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.740
That game is so much fun.

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.180
And of course, there were clones like Funny Man and

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.420
blah, blah, blah.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.420
Now, this was kind of cool.

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.100
And I remember reading up on this a while back that there

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.880
were a bunch of students that went to Simon Fraser

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.820
University, who did Lifesize Pac-Man, who used laptops and

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:24.580
mobile phone GPS to track where the dots were and where

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.100
Pac-Man was.

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:30.900
And it is now played regularly in downtown Vancouver.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:35.100
There's also another one that's Pac-Manhatten, where

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:39.140
Pac-Man is played around Washington Square Park.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.540
And I've actually seen video of that one.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:43.220
That one's pretty cool.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.620
Actually, they were going to do a Pac-Man movie in 2004.

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.420
Crystal Sky Pictures said they were going to do it.

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.940
And no.

01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.340
Thank god, because it would have been terrible.

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.580
It was supposed to be $200 million.

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.700
And as you heard in the background, there was Pac-Man

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.860
Fever, which was just put out for fun.

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.580
And it actually made it to number nine on

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.020
Billboard Hot 100 charts.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:16.620
Guinness World Records gave Pac-Man eight records in 2008,

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:18.500
including first perfect Pac-Man game for Billy

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.840
Mitchell, asshole, most successful coin-operated game,

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.660
largest Pac-Man game for Pac-Manhatten.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:33.180
Really, it's been sort of a generation-defining game.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.740
And also, Rob, now you have to find this, because we have to

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.080
play this.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:42.500
There was the Pac-Man 7-Up commercial, set sort of to a

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.420
modified tune like Betty Davis' eyes.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.500
I would be happy to, but act-deaf is going to have a

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.980
coronary if you don't mention Pac-Man Championship Edition.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:50.700
I did.

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.700
Oh, you must have missed it.

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.660
Amongst the gazillion other Pac-Man games you mentioned.

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.340
Of course, I'm sure you mentioned the Pac-Man animated

01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:58.980
series.

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:00.220
Oh, yes.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:15.140
We'll look at each other.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.380
This is creepy.

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:29.900
This is very creepy.

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.140
Only in the Amex.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.020
This is actually on TV.

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:38.700
Yes, it was.

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:41.260
I don't remember ever seeing this.

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.100
This is kind of scary.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:43.340
All right.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.420
Just look down in the chatroom for

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.260
what you want us to watch.

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.500
Sure, sure.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.540
You see what I mean by the sound of Betty Davis' eyes?

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.540
Oh, yeah, I hear it.

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.900
Hold on, I'm going to fire up my favorite Pac-Man parody

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.460
while Jamie finishes up the game.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.100
Oh, I'm pretty much done.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:01.980
But yeah, Pac-Man.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.860
OK, this is my favorite frickin' Pac-Man

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.660
parody they ever had, OK?

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.260
This is like the best thing ever.

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:10.500
Here we go.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.700
Math Man, your mission is?

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.460
Math Man is not here.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.380
Oh, where is he?

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.260
He's in the math room.

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.340
OK.

01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:30.740
Mr. Glitch, your mission is to eat all the pentagons on the

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.780
board and no other polygons.

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:34.580
When you encounter a polygon, you'll have to be

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.580
health-free to make her to see.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:37.940
Thank you very much.

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:38.940
End of discussion.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.100
There is no further debate.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.540
Math Man was the greatest.

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.740
Forget that 7UP commercial.

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:44.980
Math Man was the bomb.

01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:46.260
All right.

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:46.740
That's it.

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.740
We're going to take a break now here on

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.860
Orange Lawns Radio.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.500
And if you're listening on the podcast, the good news is you

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.900
only have to wait like 10 seconds.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:55.660
For those of you listening live, we need a moment to

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.180
stretch and refill our drinks and so forth and have a little

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:00.100
break here in studio.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:02.340
But we'll be back in just a few more minutes here with

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.060
more of Orange Lawns Radio and some stories coming up.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.700
Xbox 360, we've barely touched on what's going on in

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:08.780
Microsoft's world.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.900
Their whole damn E3 lineup might have just

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.820
leaked to the internet.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.800
We'll discuss what's been leaked and if it carries any

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.500
weight or not.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.940
We'll be back in a little bit with more

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.380
of Orange Lawns Radio.

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:24.260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lawns Radio on this

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:28.420
lovely Sunday evening, May the 17th of 2009.

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:32.660
We tape live every Sunday here at All Games Radio.

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.660
That's www.allgames.com.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.860
We follow the Bobby Blackwolf Show at Roughly.

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:40.820
See, we're amateur radio.

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:41.740
We can't speak right.

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:42.620
Bobby Blackwolf.

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:44.740
The Bobbily Bobbily.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:45.660
Jeez, Louise.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.620
OK, the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:51.020
Which is at Roughly 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9

01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:53.300
o'clock Eastern Time every Sunday night, right here on

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:54.420
All Games Radio.

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.540
It's a fun time, so you should definitely tune in.

01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.220
Anyhow, we've got more gaming news to get back into.

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:02.980
It's myself and Loki and Dark Soccer all joining you on this

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:03.860
lovely evening.

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.820
And I was just thinking, how funny would it be if somebody

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.620
didn't get the memo that we moved studios tonight and was

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.420
showing up at the old studio unannounced?

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:11.820
Funny for us, not for them.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:13.260
Yeah, I know exactly.

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.940
Funny, not funny.

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.780
All right, we have some Xbox 360 news to get

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:18.860
into right now.

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:20.380
Loki.

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:26.740
Apparently, there's a new Xbox exclusive coming.

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:30.300
And this is coming from a new company that Microsoft has

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.660
purchased, Big Park.

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:37.540
And apparently, they're responsible for such

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:40.180
franchises, or at least they had a hand in it, for Need

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:42.540
for Speed, SSX, and NBA Street.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:46.300
And this new game, though, is supposed to be something that

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:51.020
will broaden audiences and will be playable at E3.

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:51.820
Huh.

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.980
Let me guess.

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:55.660
Could it be something that ties in with that motion

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:58.140
camera that doesn't exist?

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:02.060
That could be like a Wii Sports type of game.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.260
I'm going to guess yes.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.460
That's probably what it's going to be.

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:08.380
Well, that is a completely baseless guess right there.

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.260
How dare you, sir?

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:09.820
What do I know?

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:13.740
I'm not an industry analyst.

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:15.500
So I apparently know nothing about this.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.140
What exactly does it take to have the title industry

01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:18.780
analyst?

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:21.340
Because maybe I would like to just have that after my name.

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:23.580
Kiss enough ass to get promoted.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:24.980
Well, I promote myself.

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:25.940
How's that?

01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.500
At Orange Lawns Radio, I am the industry analyst.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.500
I just promoted myself.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:34.060
Well, you have to be, I guess, on call with big companies

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:39.420
and have to make a, or have to be on call with big companies.

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.780
Or help them make decisions.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.260
I don't know.

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.860
I can do that.

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.260
I'd be good at that.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:46.540
Whatever.

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:46.860
All right.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:50.060
Well, anyhow, moving on with some other gaming news.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:53.580
By the way, I forgot to mention it at the top of the hour.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.860
But we are going to still be giving away that Smile DK

01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.620
signed copy of PlayStation 2 DDR Supernova 2.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:02.460
We're going to give that away in a little while.

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:03.500
We'll probably do it around, yeah, we'll

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:06.620
do it around the mailbag segment a little later this hour.

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:09.900
Anyhow, we got some news from Q Entertainment

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:11.420
has filed a trademark.

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:13.900
Now, of course, you know I love me some Q Entertainment.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:15.820
They're the folks that put out Luminous.

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:19.740
And let's see, they put out, well, they put out Luminous.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:20.220
Res.

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:20.700
No, I'm just kidding.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.380
Yeah, they res every extend extra.

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.420
If you want to trace back Mizuguchi,

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.180
who's behind Q Games, he did such great things

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:28.300
to Space Channel 5.

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.180
99 Nights?

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.340
Yeah, well, we just overlooked 99 Nights.

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.340
Hopefully, this game is going to be amazing.

01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.700
It's called Guardian Hearts, is the name of the trademark.

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:39.660
Now, you want to keep in mind, this is just

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:41.100
a trademark that's been filed.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.820
Nothing is definitely concrete about this yet.

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:44.300
We don't know.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.380
It could, you know, games sometimes change names

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.660
and so on and so forth.

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.420
However, I hold out hope that somehow Mizuguchi

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:53.740
got the rights to make the sequel to Guardian Legend,

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.340
and it's called Guardian Hearts.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.780
That's what I'm holding out for.

01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.740
Not bloody likely.

01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:58.780
Yeah, not bloody likely.

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:01.260
But it does sound, it doesn't sound a little role playing-ish

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:01.580
to you.

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.020
Doesn't it?

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:03.580
Like a little bit?

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.820
Like, Guardian Hearts kind of sounds role playing-ish.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.180
Or magical girl game.

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.700
So, well, that could be fun too.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.020
But either way, you know, I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi,

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.220
so I would be very happy if he's doing a role playing game,

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.140
as long as it's not like 99 Nights.

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.740
But there you have it.

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.900
Guardian Hearts possibly coming soon.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:20.380
Who knows?

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.700
Maybe as soon as E3, but don't hold your breath.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:27.820
Well, Telltale has some new episodic series for E3.

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:33.020
They are, um, well, they're not saying what it is,

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.820
but then again, these are the people that gave us Sam & Max

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.820
and Showing Bads Cool Game for Attractive People

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:38.780
and Wallace & Gromit.

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:45.420
But it's also going to commemorate, as far as I'm aware,

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.420
the fifth year anniversary for the company,

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.300
which is pretty cool.

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.780
Especially making it while the market's gone to shit.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:55.180
So, um, hopefully it'll be something really cool.

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:55.820
I'm sure it will.

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:59.180
Everything they've put out so far, you know, recently has been pretty cool.

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:05.900
And also, um, for, uh, uh, people who like a good deal,

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:09.660
the entire season of Strong Bads Cool Game for Attractive People

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:12.220
is half price on Steam until Monday.

01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:14.460
Yikes. Better hurry.

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:15.020
Yep.

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:15.740
That's pretty cool.

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:17.180
All right.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:20.380
Well, uh, I know I'm, uh, I'm curious to see what they cook up next.

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.660
That company's been doing very well.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:22.060
You're right.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:23.900
I think one point you made there is they've been doing pretty well

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.220
in the face of a company's closing and so forth.

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.980
Day of the Tentacle! Day of the Tentacle! Day of the Tentacle!

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:29.820
Uh, don't hold your breath, but you never know.

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:30.700
You never know.

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.300
It's the only Luke Starts franchise-

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.180
Well, one of them that they haven't touched yet.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:36.860
Day of the Tentacle! Come on!

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:39.580
That's what we need.

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:40.700
More Maniac Mansion.

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.340
Um, anyways.

01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.140
So, I don't know.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:50.540
Other than, uh, Day of the Tentacle, what more can we talk about?

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:51.260
I know!

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:59.900
How about the supposed, and this is all rumor, lineup for a Microsoft press conference?

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:07.980
Apparently, there is a new industry source, or somebody that's claiming to be an industry source,

01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:16.220
in tradition of Surfer Girl, who apparently has gone into retirement from leaking information.

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:20.380
Um, Game Fork. This is coming from Twitter.

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:25.740
And they have been tweeting about different things coming from the Microsoft press conference.

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.500
Um, including-

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500
So it's not like your normal Twitter where it's like,

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.220
I just ate a ham sandwich and it was delicious.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.340
No, it's not.

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:34.460
BRB pooping.

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:36.620
Not quite.

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.540
By the way, if you want to join the OLR Twitter, we don't put Twits like that.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:44.380
We just like to remind you when the show is live and post other little tidbits about the show,

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.980
but we will not share when we are pooping like other people do on Twitter.

01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.780
Like you have time to type that, if you gotta go, you gotta go.

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.460
Unless you lie about it.

01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:55.180
But you can, you know, instead of reading a magazine, you could Twitter from the potty,

01:27:55.180 --> 01:28:00.060
and I've seen, I've actually, I have a friend that has updated her Facebook status

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.140
to say, hi, I'm on the toilet.

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:04.800
Nice.

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:08.460
That's the day and age we live in.

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:13.980
Well, um, apparently, uh, here are some of the things that were on that list.

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:18.700
Starting off with, of course, they're going to reveal a new motion sensing camera controller.

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:21.020
It's going to be called the Xbox Fluid.

01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:25.980
Um, apparently they're going to end the whole thing with a finale.

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:32.140
And I don't know if I can believe this, but Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus Oxide.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:37.740
It's apparently a rumor of the X, or a Xbox 360 port with, you know, kind of that

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.780
extra added content on there.

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:43.500
You were right.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.100
That's apparently going to be their finale.

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:53.020
And then, there's supposed to be a top secret exclusive Xbox 360 tile that nobody outside

01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:55.900
of Konami has been told what this is.

01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.500
Yet, this guy knows what it is.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:06.140
But, I have a feeling that that might be the new Castlevania game, since they haven't

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:08.220
really shown much of that.

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:08.720
Ooh!

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:10.380
That's right!

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:13.340
We haven't had one on the new Next Gen series, have we?

01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:14.620
They had a little preview video.

01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:15.980
That's right!

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:18.620
It was like two seconds of nothing.

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.100
Yeah.

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:19.740
Interesting.

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.060
Okay.

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:20.860
So there might be that.

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:27.900
The second Grand Theft Auto 4 download content was supposed to be announced and being subtitled

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:36.540
Blood and a Four Leaf Clover, which may follow the other character that was in the game,

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:42.700
Packey, and his brothers as they try to pull off a bank heist or something like that, because

01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:43.500
that was in the game.

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:45.180
Interesting.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:53.820
The new Peter Milano project, codenamed Richter, is supposed to be shown.

01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:59.260
They're going to show some stuff about Forza 3, that's going to be playable.

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:06.700
Alan Wake is going to be there, as well as APB, which is going to be announced, available

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:11.580
for the Xbox 360, I'm assuming, unless they're going to be covering games for Windows there.

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:17.340
Splinter Cell Conviction will be on hand, Lost Planet 2, Assassin's Creed 2, Bioshock

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:22.140
2, Halo 3 ODST, which is not surprising.

01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:31.100
And then, I think that was it, but it's interesting because of course Microsoft responded back

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:36.700
with, no that's not even close to what we have, but I guess we'll have to see if that's

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.180
actually, I mean some of this stuff could be educated guesses, I mean everyone's assuming

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:44.380
that Alan Wake will be there, obviously they're going to have the new Grand Theft Auto download

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:46.860
content since it's due out in the fall.

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.340
But seriously, Blood and a Four Leaf Clover?

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:53.260
Like, that's a very interesting title for a game.

01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:59.340
Yeah, it is interesting, although it doesn't really fit with what everyone was thinking

01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:04.140
the next game's going to be, because basically there's a mission where you have this drug

01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.140
deal and there's three people involved.

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:11.900
The first one being Nico from the first game, the second one being Johnny from the second

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:16.860
download content, and then the third one is some other guy who they're thinking is going

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:21.740
to be the third download content, and it's all supposed to merge on that one mission.

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:25.740
But, I don't know, we'll see I guess what happens there.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:33.820
Interesting nonetheless though, and Rockstar did say that they are going to announce the

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:37.420
next download content, so I mean we kind of figured that was going to happen anyways,

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:40.700
but they didn't confirm that that's the subtitle that they had.

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:48.700
So, and then the guys behind APB said yes, they will be at E3 with a big announcement.

01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.540
So, a lot of stuff just hints at that, but see then again you can take all those hints

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:53.980
and kind of come up with educated guess.

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:58.460
I don't know, but the point is, you know, why fake, you know, these announcements or

01:31:58.460 --> 01:31:59.660
something other, I don't know.

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:01.900
Well, I think some of it holds weight.

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.420
I think the fluid thing is going to happen.

01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.940
I think we all know that...

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:07.420
It may not be called the fluid, but you know, it might be something.

01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:11.820
Yeah, I think that's a pretty likely name actually, all things considered.

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.580
That's, you know, it makes sense, especially if the whole thing is about motion and it

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:18.860
sees everything in little subtle movements and all that.

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.300
I bet anything that fluid is a very possible name for this.

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.060
Yeah, but we'll see.

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:28.780
actdeft in chat very plainly says MGS4 on 360 ain't happening.

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:32.860
And lazy days follows that up with because Kojima's done.

01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:36.300
That is a hard one to believe, but what about now Metal Gear Solid 5?

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.580
I don't think they would necessarily have a trailer or anything, but what about an announcement?

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.060
I don't think it's going to be Metal Gear Solid 4.

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:46.220
I don't think that's going to come to the 360 because, you know, the amount of data

01:32:46.220 --> 01:32:50.220
that's on there, unless they went back and found a way to compress all that down and

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:51.260
stuff like that.

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:55.180
Or if they have a way that you can now with installations and stuff like that, you can

01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.340
just install all the disks to your hard drive.

01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:01.900
And really, I mean, when you think about it, you know, either waiting, you know, five minutes

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:06.940
to install a game or I don't know, making this swap that one time.

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:07.500
Oh my God.

01:33:07.500 --> 01:33:09.100
It takes like two seconds.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:10.300
Is it such a big deal?

01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:12.620
I don't think so, but who knows?

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:14.380
All right.

01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:18.780
Well, it'll be interesting to see if this actually holds weight at E3 because if it

01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:23.580
does, then this whole little Twitter source is going to be huge in the future.

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:23.900
Watch.

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:27.260
They'll blow up to 60,000 followers if it's the case.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:30.300
Press conference is supposed to be June 1st, 9 a.m.

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:35.420
Tora in chat says, I would gladly disk swap to play Metal Gear Solid 4.

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:37.900
I wish I could be there for the Microsoft conference, but I'm going to be getting into

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.180
town on June 1st.

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.580
I might get to go to Sony's.

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.380
Might.

01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:44.060
I'm watching both.

01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:47.340
I'm not going to go because I'm not going to even be there.

01:33:47.340 --> 01:33:48.300
It's going to be tough.

01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.060
Anyhow, let's move on and go into Rock Band Unplugged.

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.820
Of course, as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, he's got to take a sneak peek at it.

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:58.860
And a lot of people have been taking a sneak peek at the game because the track list is

01:33:58.860 --> 01:33:59.500
at the internet.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.500
This game, by the way, is coming out June 9th, 2009, which is right around the corner

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:04.380
from E3 week.

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.940
That's all that's hit the internet.

01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.260
Yeah, well, I bet a lot of folks have already been getting it.

01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:13.660
But if you are being a good boy or a good girl and waiting until its actual release

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:15.820
day, some of the things you have to look forward to.

01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:19.180
I'm just going to read you some of the songs that are exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged,

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:20.460
at least for a little while.

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.220
They do emphasize for a limited time.

01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:27.980
AFI, Miss Murder, Audioslave, Gasoline, Black Tide, Show Me The Way, Freeze Pop, Let's

01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:28.700
Talk More Rock.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.740
Now, see, I thought that song was in Rock Band.

01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:32.700
I thought it was in Rock Band.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:36.140
I thought it was too, but they're not only an exclusive game, maybe because it was download

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:36.540
content.

01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:36.860
I don't know.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:42.380
Three Doors Down, Kryptonite, Alice in Chains, Wood, Blink-182, What's My Age Again.

01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:45.100
Again, wasn't that download content or am I mixing it up with Dammit?

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:45.580
I don't know.

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:51.660
Tora in chat says it's Guitar Hero.

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:52.620
It's a Guitar Hero song.

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:56.060
That's why they're marking it as an exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged.

01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:01.180
1970s brings us ABC by The Jackson 5.

01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:03.180
That's the other big exclusive song.

01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:07.100
The rest of them are all songs you might recognize from the game already, like some of the ones

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.300
I personally like.

01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.140
Float On by Modest Mouse.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:10.940
That's pretty cool.

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:17.820
Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Today, Smashing Pumpkins, I Was Wrong, Social Distortion,

01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.180
Weezer, Buddy Holly.

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.300
It'll be fun.

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:21.420
White Wedding, Billy Idol.

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:22.620
You gotta have some Billy Idol.

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:26.700
Susie and the Banshees, yes, Killing Jar, pretty decent song list.

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:29.180
I don't know, but Loki seems to maybe disagree.

01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:29.980
It's okay.

01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:35.260
It's something I'd play off and on, but you know, it's not a game I could really get into

01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:41.580
like the normal rock band, unless they have, you know, a more variety of download content,

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:44.700
like, you know, some pop songs and that kind of stuff.

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:49.260
Because this, they could do that, but are they?

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:53.500
I mean, ABC, that's definitely Poppy, so we'll see.

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:57.580
Well, don't we have Lego Rock Band to come fill in the pop void?

01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.260
That's true, but that's another game.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.380
That's not this game.

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:06.220
Lego Rock Band, I am very interested in picking up just, well, after I see the soundtrack,

01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.060
but I don't know.

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:12.220
Well, speaking of download content, there's going to be download stuff available right

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:16.060
off the bat for this game, and some of the songs have already been announced there.

01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:19.260
Now, some of it overlaps with what you can already download.

01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:21.900
Actually, I think all of it does.

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:26.780
Muse with Hysteria, No Doubt, Just a Girl, Paramore, Crush Crush Crush, Red Hot Chili

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:27.820
Peppers Under the Bridge.

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:31.180
Some of the, I think all of these songs are already available on regular rock band, but

01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.540
if you want to pay for it again, you can.

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:39.100
I wish I could get the songs that I have on my rock band over, but I know that's not going

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:39.500
to happen.

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:40.620
Why not?

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.580
They'll charge me twice.

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:45.900
By the way, the chat room always filling in the void when we don't know things right off

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:50.540
the bat, off the top of our head, which, you know, hey, look, we know a lot about video

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:53.260
games, but we don't have the brain capacity to know everything about video games.

01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:56.380
That's why the chat room really helps us out every week.

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:59.900
Act Def says the only Blink 182 songs are Dammit and All the Small Things.

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.140
So I guess What's My Age Again actually isn't in there.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:05.180
Maybe I'm getting it mixed up with Sing Star, because I have too many music games at home.

01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:05.680
I don't know.

01:37:06.540 --> 01:37:07.180
So there you go.

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:12.860
Death Wishing calls Lego rock band Lego Fail Band.

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:13.340
We'll see.

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.260
Game's got a little while before it comes out.

01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:16.620
Does it get hit with the fail pail?

01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:17.900
Hopefully not.

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:19.820
That's my hope.

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:23.340
Well, here's something that may or may not be fail.

01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:24.140
It just depends.

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:29.500
There's a splash page for a particular game showing up on Xbox.com.

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:35.260
But I'm pretty sure that splash page means actual release.

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:39.740
So that'd be Wolfenstein 3D on Xbox Live.

01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.660
And I kind of hope that it's given the HD treatment.

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:47.020
But do you really want to shoot HD red-eyed Hitler in the face?

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:48.940
I don't think it's going to be having the HD treatment.

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.620
And it makes sense with a new Wolfenstein game coming out in a few months.

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:53.020
That's true.

01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:56.700
But I think it'd be nice to give it the HD treatment.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.100
It'd be cool.

01:37:59.100 --> 01:37:59.980
I don't think it's going to be cool.

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:01.100
Cool, but not bloody likely.

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.700
Yeah, not likely.

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:05.500
I mean, they didn't really do that with Doom or Duke Nukem.

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.260
So I don't think they're going to start now.

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:08.460
It'd be kind of...

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:10.060
It'd look weird anyways if he did that.

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.220
It'd kind of take away from the cheapness.

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.940
Now what they needed to have is Rise of the Triad on there.

01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:15.820
Because that'd be sweet.

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.540
Yes, a lot better than...

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.900
Actually, it would be kind of cool with Wolfenstein if they did it.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.340
It was like co-op or something like that.

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:24.380
That'd be kind of cool too.

01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.300
But they're definitely not going to do that either.

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:31.500
Well, there's a couple stories I have here about GameTap.

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:37.180
Including, they're going to start featuring some of the Microsoft Game Studios stuff.

01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:43.660
Including Age of Mythology, Age of Empires II, Fable, The Lost Chapter, Freelancer,

01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:48.700
MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, Rise of the Nation, and Zoo Tycoon.

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:58.860
And apparently right now, the US and Europe have...

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:05.580
Europe is getting Fable, The Lost Chapter, and MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, and Zoo Tycoon.

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:12.220
And then also, I guess, US is getting Age of Empires II and Fable right now.

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.460
And the rest are going to roll out slowly later.

01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.820
Which is kind of neat.

01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:22.860
And then also, GameTap has apparently the rights right now for Panzer Dragoon Saga.

01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:24.380
Sweet!

01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:27.980
However, they're running into some emulation complexities.

01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:31.740
And haven't been able to release it yet.

01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:36.220
But can I say one other thing about my gaming week, since you brought it up?

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:37.740
I tried to get back into GameTap.

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:43.100
I haven't played GameTap since they switched from their little front-end program they used

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.780
to browser integrated.

01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:47.020
And might I say, I hate it.

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.780
I hate the new GameTap.

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:52.140
Like, it took me forever to get it to figure out how to work.

01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.140
Like, the old one was so much better.

01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.820
Why did they make it worse?

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:59.340
I guess they were acquired by this new company or whatever, but I don't like it.

01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:03.260
Now it feels like I'm going on to, like, a cheap Games.Yahoo site or playing things.

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:05.660
Like, you know, right there in the browser window and all that stuff.

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:06.860
I don't like it at all.

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:08.700
Like, it seems like what they had before was just fine.

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:09.980
I don't know.

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:11.740
You know I used to be a huge GameTap fan.

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:13.660
In fact, people thought I was on their payroll and stuff.

01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:16.220
I do not like these changes they've been making lately.

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:20.380
And it kind of, I'm still irritated at the fact that nothing runs in Windows Vista.

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:23.500
This didn't used to bug me because I didn't always use Windows Vista.

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.820
But, you know, I understand emulation, blah, blah, blah.

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:26.700
Not everything's possible.

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:28.460
But it's just, ugh, it's annoying.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:30.700
Well, also, the whole Panzer Dragon thing.

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:34.380
They're all, the complexity of the Saturn emulation is what's holding it back.

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:38.860
I have a perfectly functioning Saturn emulator already, you know.

01:40:38.860 --> 01:40:40.860
So it can be done.

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:43.820
And they're all, well, we're not sure if enough people want this game.

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:48.460
So, you know, if we get enough people wanting it, then we'll spend the large

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.780
development time that's going to take to do this.

01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:55.180
Rama in chat says, run it under XP compatibility.

01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:56.060
Does it work?

01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.660
Look at GameTap's own FAQs.

01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:58.220
It'll tell you.

01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:58.700
It doesn't work.

01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:02.860
I tried that when it was still on the front end system because I can't play Civ 4,

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.300
which kind of makes me mad.

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:04.780
I don't know.

01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:09.820
I just, I see the value of GameTap kind of going down, not up.

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:12.780
And that's what kind of, you know, I still think it's an all right value.

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:14.780
You know, you do get a lot of freaking games.

01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:15.900
And at least you're paying for it.

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:19.340
So you have that whole good karma thing going on instead of just being a maim

01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:20.700
whore with all the ROMs.

01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:22.060
And there's some decent stuff on there.

01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:23.740
But damn, they've got some work to do.

01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:25.900
And I hate the new front end compared to the old one.

01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:27.500
I don't know.

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.540
It's, I was kind of dumb and bought a whole year in advance, but whatever.

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:33.980
They got you hooked and then changed it.

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:35.420
I get, yeah, exactly.

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.620
That's what I feel like exactly is what it is, is that they got me hooked on

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.660
something that was pretty awesome.

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:41.180
And then the rug got pulled out from under me.

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.620
I do not like the browser setup.

01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:43.740
Blah.

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:49.900
Anyhow, one thing I might like a little more than the new GameTap is the slim

01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.260
PlayStation 3.

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:53.580
That is if rumors are to be believed.

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:57.020
Uh, apparently there are pictures floating around on the blogs this week

01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.260
of a PlayStation 3 slim.

01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:03.340
Apparently what will happen on this PlayStation 3 slim is that instead of

01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:06.380
that whole, like, uh, kind of shiny black look, it'll look a little more

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.060
like a PlayStation 2.

01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:12.860
And, uh, apparently now, instead of having a Spider-Man looking logo, it'll

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:15.020
kind of look just like a PlayStation 2.

01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:15.900
Uh, who knows?

01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:18.620
Maybe this is just a Photoshop PlayStation 2 box.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.420
But, uh, who knows?

01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:20.300
It is rumors.

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:23.100
They actually have pictures of the actual diecast step too.

01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:23.740
Do they really?

01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.580
I mean, I don't know.

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.980
It might be a prototype, but then again, they have a box.

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:28.540
So I don't know.

01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:30.940
I, I'm a little iffy on this.

01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:33.580
It's still, doesn't it still seem a little soon?

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.620
Well, not necessarily because if you think about it, remember when we had a

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:40.940
rumor like this for the Xbox 360, that it was getting a built-in HDMI port.

01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:44.540
And sure enough, those pictures leaked out of like the motherboard and

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.540
everything with the HDMI port in it.

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:49.660
And then we got the systems with the HDMI ports now.

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:52.540
So I'm not surprised this is going to eventually happen.

01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.460
And maybe it's happening right now.

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:57.420
Maybe they think this redesigns what's going to get people to buy it.

01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:00.140
I think they're stupid because it's just like the same, you know, Oh,

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.900
let's take out the backwards compatibility.

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:02.700
Oh, let's.

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:04.780
Now take out some of those USB ports.

01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:06.380
Oh, let's do this.

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.300
Put the backwards compatibility back in.

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:09.980
Maybe you'll now you'll be talking.

01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:10.860
But who knows?

01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:13.260
I mean, if they're going to, I don't know, but maybe this is why they keep

01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:13.980
swearing up and down.

01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:16.300
There's not going to be a price drop because there's just going to be

01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.740
a new system instead.

01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:18.300
Who knows?

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:20.700
I don't know if they had the backwards compatibility backyard and

01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:24.060
people are going to get pissed, but then again there are some stupid people out there that will buy

01:43:24.060 --> 01:43:29.180
another system for this, but I don't understand why you can just buy a Playstation 2.

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:32.420
Maybe that's what they're hoping. People are just going to get fed up and buy another

01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:35.700
Playstation 2 or something. I don't know.

01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:42.420
Well, there you go. That's it. Sony is supposedly releasing a slim Playstation 3.

01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:47.460
We will see more at possibly E3 this week. But you know what? I don't know about you guys,

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:51.580
but all these rumors running around left and right, it seems like anybody can come up with

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:55.180
a rumor in this day and age. And not being able to sort all this shit out makes me a

01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:58.940
little angsty. Do you know what happens when we get angsty?

01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.940
People die. That, and there's a nephews of the week segment.

01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:30.700
My nephew is going to go to finals sapping my brain, my strength, my willpower, and any

01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:39.460
ounce of energy I could possibly have. I just want to pass, and I want to take a break.

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:46.340
My nephew uses a stool, it's hurting my butt. At least it's not the other kind of stool.

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:50.180
Yes, that is true. Do you have a hard stool?

01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:58.140
I do have a hard stool right now. Ew, you should put that on Twitter.

01:44:58.140 --> 01:45:02.700
Let's see, my nephew of the week goes to, I don't really have a lot. You know what?

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:06.620
Things are actually going pretty good in my life right now. I can't complain. Chicago

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:08.220
was fun. Make up something.

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:11.860
No, I do have one. But I just want to say, you know what? All things are actually pretty

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:17.000
good except, a few to my broken air conditioner. Because living in a house with no air conditioner

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.460
in 100 degree weather sucks. So a few to that. But thank you to people like Jamie who let

01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:27.740
me come over and sit in their air conditioned house all night.

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:30.780
Actually, now that it's gotten cooler outside, this room is a lot more comfortable.

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:36.460
Yeah, it's nice now. So there you go. But yeah, not having an air conditioning really

01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:43.360
sucks. Anyway, what sucks a little less is your emails. You email us every week at mailbag

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:47.820
at orangelaundry.com and DarkSakura dives head first in the email bag and read some

01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:52.480
of your emails. And yes, we're also going to be giving away a signed autographed copy

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:59.140
of Smile DK signing Supernova. We did have people get all five right. I'll tell you right

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:04.100
off the bat, if you didn't get all five right, sorry, you didn't win. Play again next time.

01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:07.100
But we did have several people that got all five and we're going to be telling you who

01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:11.700
won right after the email bag segment.

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:18.740
DarkSakura, who's sending some email to mailbag this week?

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:27.700
The first one is from, let's see, Taz. Hey there, this is my first email to the OLR mailbag

01:46:27.700 --> 01:46:33.180
and I want to suggest a retro game if it hasn't already been on the show already. Redundant.

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:39.780
The game is Live Alive, an RPG from Squaresoft for the Super Famicom. I know about this game.

01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:43.420
It was not released outside of Japan, but some unofficial translations are out there

01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:50.740
in the net. The real title is sort of a mirror image of Live Alive as with the other lives

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:56.260
spelled backwards where you see evil in the second half rather than live. I thought this

01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:00.100
game had one of the most original ideas for a game to date. You select one of seven playable

01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:04.060
characters and each character belongs to a different time period and has his or her own

01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:10.140
story for the story play like a complete, all stories play like a complete, a completely

01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:13.700
different RPG and they're short and easy to learn. For example, the caveman stories about

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:18.340
a caveman saving his love because they haven't invented the language. There are no text box

01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:24.180
speeches in the story, but they communicate with figures in dialogue bubbles. Hilarity

01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:29.660
ensues. Some of the stories have a much darker tone as others may make you cry. I'm sorry,

01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:32.940
and others may make you cry. I really enjoyed the story for the robot in the future, which

01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:37.980
plays like a survival horror. I suggest anyone who likes retro RPGs pick up this title. I'm

01:47:37.980 --> 01:47:43.140
sure Square won't mind any more about the translated ROM. It'd be awesome if they add

01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:48.100
this game to a virtual console. I'd buy it. P.S. My also favorite RPG is Secret of Mana

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:53.500
followed by Xenogears and Chrono Trigger. All are must plays. I'll give it a download.

01:47:53.500 --> 01:48:00.480
If I have time, I'll give it a download. So sure. Yeah, I've not heard of this game ever,

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.460
but it sounds very interesting. So that's all I got. I like listener submitted classic

01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:08.780
games of the week. They know more obscure shit than we do sometimes. I know of this

01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:12.980
game. Do you really? Yes. I've never heard of it. In fact, I think I know someone who

01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:26.340
owns it. Wow. Um, oh, yeah, this is, never mind. Um, this is from, uh, FrozenRay? I really

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:32.760
don't like it. Oh, GS68, sorry. Um, hey Jamie, hey Loki, hey Robrobrob. So by the time you're

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.220
reading this, your business at ASIN is done. I hope that went well. You've been hyping

01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:40.780
that up, but no mention of Faname, which has led me to believe you're not going this year,

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:45.160
most likely subsequent years, which means, once again, I'll be the only active OLR listener

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:50.100
at Faname. Since I'm rather sure OLR at Faname is not going to happen, I'm going to make

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:54.780
a bet, if you do go to Faname after all, I will make myself cosplay as Rei Ayanami, oh

01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:59.860
my god, don't, at Faname 2010, and that means the whole universe is going to die. Yes, they

01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:04.580
will. I'll also consider a scheme to get Eye of Judgment to sell a million copies by May

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:10.260
2010, so Loki also has to cosplay a tingle at the con. It's never going to happen because

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:17.540
I think they've stopped making it, so, it's done. It's done. If you don't go to Faname,

01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:23.260
then I hope to see Dark Sakura, um, and maybe, maybe Rob at California Extreme this July

01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:29.340
is possible. That is more likely than Faname. I do want to confirm, just, uh, we did not

01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:34.380
make plans to attend Faname this year, nothing against Faname, it's a lovely con, but just

01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.260
so much other stuff going on. I'm actually trying to save up money to go to Las Vegas

01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:43.820
in July. For me, I had stuff going on with, um, you guys know I do some theater stuff

01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.820
on the weekends, and I just had a conflict, so, um, I couldn't do it. But I hope those

01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:53.460
of you guys that are going have a lot of fun. Less than 3 GS68 PS, this email is brought

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:58.260
to you by the South Bay Home of the Never Ending Overcast Weather. However, California

01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:02.060
Extreme I have never been and I really want to go, and this is my year of going to things

01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:06.980
I haven't done before. It's fun. I know, so, I went to ASEN, I've, how many years did it

01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:12.060
take for me to finally get there, like 4 years? So, uh, maybe I'll do California Extreme finally.

01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:15.660
Well, I hope you don't have, you know, my experience of, you know, waiting 3 years to

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:20.060
do something and then it finally sucking when you do it. What was that? Tower of Terror.

01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:26.500
Oh, hey, I love Tower of Terror. It, it freaked me the hell out. I can't do it ever again.

01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:31.500
Aww, it's fun. I heart it. I'm actually trying to go to Disneyland 1-3. I've been in an elevator

01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:37.660
when it fell 2 stories. I know, that can't be fun. And you know what? Mmm. Marissa was

01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:42.100
saying that it's the first part that scares you, that the whole story part was the scary

01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:46.180
part and the psyching you up. Oh no, the drop is the scariest part. Oh no. The lead up was

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:51.360
fun. I loved all that. But the dropping, I was like, yeah, I remember this feeling, only

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:57.740
this is worse because it's pushing you. So yeah. I want to say, chat real quick, chat.orensonshortory.com.

01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:01.220
Tora says, it was fun meeting Rob at ASEN. Thank you, it was fun meeting you too. Though

01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:04.900
he looked kind of out of it on Saturday. Yeah, again, did you hear the part about 9 people

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:09.920
in the hotel room? That was the cocaine. Shut up. Cocaine's a hell of a drug. And then somebody

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:15.100
who didn't change their name, their recruit number 3972 says, what about Comic Con? I

01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:19.820
would love to go to Comic Con and Miss Victoria has been begging me. I don't know if you remember

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:23.220
her. She was on the show a while ago when Jamie was out one week. She'd been begging

01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:26.860
me to go to Comic Con, but this year it's not going to happen because we're going to

01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:31.220
see no doubt the same weekend. I want to go to Comic Con just to, you know, harass my

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:35.100
favorite Marvel people if they're there. I want to go one year because you run into celebrities

01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:39.780
all the time there and I'm dying to meet Zachary Quinto because he's dreamy. But anyway, maybe

01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:45.460
next year. This email, dun dun dun. Hi, OLR crew. I just wanted to say after your last

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:48.100
show, my girlfriend and I went to Safeway and bought three pounds of bacon for eight

01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:53.500
bucks and made bacon and pancakes for her mother on Mother's Day. It was very delicious

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:56.620
and it was even more delicious knowing I was helping save Americans from idiots who think

01:51:56.620 --> 01:52:00.980
swine flu comes from cooked pork meat. You, sir, are American of the week. Thank you very

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:08.700
much. Round of applause, please. Who is this emailer? AZHP. AZHP. You, sir. I'm actually

01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:12.700
a model citizen. I've actually been trying to think of my next big thing that I'm going

01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:16.360
to do. And because, you know, it is the summer and, you know, ice cream stuff, we had this

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:21.160
where we do these questions of the week type thing and they're all what custom ice cream

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:25.260
flavor would you want? And no, not baking, because that's I mean, seriously, that tastes

01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:29.180
like crap. I mean, you just can't. So I don't know. I don't know. Something baking cannot

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:34.100
make sense. I'm buying it up, but candies, bacon, ice cream, ice cream recipe. No, that's

01:52:34.100 --> 01:52:42.700
not good. But I thought of a waffle breakfast ice cream. Follow me. Oh, my God. This sounds

01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:49.380
amazing. Follow me with this. Waffle ice cream? You have waffle ice cream comb bits in there

01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:55.120
mixed in there, maple syrup, vanilla ice cream. And because you have to and I know this probably

01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:59.860
would not be good, but a little bit of butter dripped in there, you know, just because you

01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.460
need that butter flavor. Otherwise, you might be able to mix it with the maple syrup. Oh,

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:09.660
I thought about waffle ice cream and I jizzed in my pants. Wow. Oh, I see it's the alcohol

01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:13.220
in here that makes us good. But I wonder if like if I brought like maple syrup and butter

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:18.060
to like a cold stone or something like that, they could do that. Candied bacon ice cream.

01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:25.220
Hitstun in chat says this is why you're fat. Because I think of stuff. How rude. Oh, he

01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:31.620
followed it up with dot com. There is a website called this is why you're fat dot com. It's

01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:39.020
great. I'm also posting. It's dot com. That on my own Twitter, the candied bacon ice cream.

01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:44.140
There you go. All right. More emails. Sorry, we got to finish our all American email. Yes.

01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:49.420
P.S. Oh, no, there's more. Also, Dark Soccer mentioned on a podcast a few weeks that she

01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:53.700
enjoyed the Toy Story ride very much. I rode this ride back in July after a trip to Anime

01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:57.620
Expo and I thought it was awesome as well. I don't know if it will make your show roll

01:53:57.620 --> 01:54:02.700
this week, but the game is slated to be released on the Wii in some form soon. I didn't know

01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:07.980
that. I have heard this. I have heard this and I have a friend who loves Disney and is

01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:11.100
going to be probably buying a Wii just to this day. The video is on the Internet already.

01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:15.540
Oh, my gosh. I want to I hear it's going to have 3D glasses. I was actually I was actually

01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:22.100
too stunned by another Wii release that I'll be covering later in the show to think about

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:25.860
that. Everyone I'm looking forward to this game is I love the ride, but the line was

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:31.000
atrocious. That's why you go right before park closes. No line. You get in the line

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.220
and they close off the line. Anyway, love AZHP. P.S. I typed this all up on my palm

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:40.220
tree or cell phone just to prove that you can write a grammatically correct email without

01:54:40.220 --> 01:54:48.740
the presence of a full keyboard. This is as I look it up. Yes, very well done. You're

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:54.420
due to be commended. All American with good grammar. You're just like the citizen of the

01:54:54.420 --> 01:55:00.740
week. Honestly, you win a shiny gold star. There you go. Last email. Can we can we have

01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:05.380
like maybe a wiki page gold star email recipients? Yeah. I mean, we should have something where

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:12.220
someone make it like a special club for people who send just a plus quality emails and AZHP

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:19.100
is the first inductee. Yes. Someone make it. I mean, my God. Bacon, grammar, everything

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:29.060
all in one. You make it. I choose you. There you go. Okay. Last email. This is from Clone

01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:38.140
627. Hi, O.L.R. I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game against what game?

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:42.180
I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game has been that it's too soon. But

01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:47.780
oh, didn't Army of Two start with the September 11th attack? So it's too soon for mutual war,

01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:51.940
but not too soon for terrorist attack that killed tons of civilians. Just a thought.

01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:55.940
And I apologize if any spelling or grammar problems. My power is out and I'm typing this

01:55:55.940 --> 01:56:02.140
on the iPhone. Sorry, you've just been owned by AZHP. Just letting you know that you've

01:56:02.140 --> 01:56:06.900
been you've been owned. Grammar has two A's. This must be about six days in Fallujah. I

01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.860
don't really think it's been two. I mean, I don't really care to be honest, you know,

01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:15.220
with how soon it was. I think we were just saying this too soon. That's probably why

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:21.220
they pulled it. You know, honestly, I wouldn't play it anyways, because it's it doesn't look

01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:28.100
good. I mean, it might be good if you want to play that type of thing. But I don't know.

01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:32.180
We don't know Konami for you. They're epic war games.

01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:37.860
Do you remember how Manhunt 2, that game kind of generated all this controversy? It was

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:42.420
like every week we had some goddamn story about Manhunt 2 and what country banned it

01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:49.140
this week. And then the game came out and it sucked. Yeah, I'm kind of reminded of that.

01:56:49.140 --> 01:56:53.220
You know, it's hard to say. I can't judge it till I play it. Six Days of Fallujah is

01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:58.420
not my type of game anyway. But I'm just saying, just because the game's always getting that

01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:01.620
buzz doesn't mean it's going to be worth it. Just saying.

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.380
Well, I lied. There's one more email. It's a doozy.

01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:05.380
All righty.

01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:11.940
Hey, y'all. I had to say it the right way, you know. First of all, thank you, Rob, for

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:15.940
getting the last podcast up in an expedient manner. I look forward to this being a trend

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:18.340
and not an isolated occurrence. Thanks again.

01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:20.100
Well, look at you, Mr. Big Words.

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:22.660
What if it's a Ms. Big Words?

01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:23.660
Fair enough. You're in the way.

01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:24.660
It actually is a Mr. Big Words.

01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:25.660
All right.

01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:30.260
Loki, congrats on the twins and thank you for your statement of not wanting to name

01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:33.860
your children after characters that populate one of your hobbies. I have-

01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:34.860
Yet.

01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:35.860
I have-

01:57:35.860 --> 01:57:38.260
It ain't over till it's over.

01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:43.060
Let me read. I have an uncle, a wrestling fan, who named his kids Austin and Hunter

01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:47.660
and he never hears the end of it. I know who he named him after, too, which is sad. Steve

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.380
Austin and Triple H.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:55.060
Oh, my God. Yeah, not doing that.

01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:59.820
I'm sure that if you act in the way that my uncle did, the ribbing will be exponentially

01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:04.260
worse. After all, there are lots of jackasses online, including this ginger kid who thinks

01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:09.660
he writes a hilarious blog. And, Jamie, let me join you in your assessment of Silent Hill

01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:13.700
3, although I did have to stop playing it near the end after getting overloaded with

01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:17.660
the imagery in the game. Oh, God. Hell, yes. Silent Hill 3 stands as one of my favorite

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:23.060
PlayStation 2 games. I only hope that when I get around to playing Silent Hill Homecoming,

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:27.180
it is fractionally as good as Silent Hill 3 and I'm gonna be starting that soon. I've

01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:30.180
got your copy still, Rob.

01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:31.180
Fun.

01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:35.780
Now, while I'm really emailing you, I didn't just message you to kiss your ass. I appreciate

01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:36.780
ass kissing, by the way.

01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:39.800
I know. You could have just kissed our ass and left it at that. We don't mind.

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:43.780
I noticed something while I was playing Mirrors Edge recently. The first day I played it,

01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:46.860
I was getting into the game and looked forward to playing it more. The second day, I played

01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:51.660
it and enjoyed it more and more. What's the difference between the gaming sessions? Music.

01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:55.140
The first day, I listened to the in-game music, but the second day, I was listening to music

01:58:55.140 --> 01:59:01.580
for my iPod, specifically Nine Inch Nails. I attribute this fact to... I attribute this

01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:07.980
fact to my enhanced... I think you meant enhanced and not enhanced enjoyment, especially since

01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:14.540
I spent the third day I was listening to Dresden Dolls and achieved a similar level of enjoyment.

01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:18.700
As I thought back along my history of playing games, I see my music being an integral part

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:22.660
of my enjoyment. Whether it's listening to Social Distortion while playing Left 4 Dead,

01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:27.760
Cake, Beck, and Seal while playing Tiger Woods PGA, or Core Metallica and Rammstein while

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:33.020
playing Final Fantasy VIII, the occasional monotony of playing games was eliminated from

01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:36.620
me by listening to the music that I love. It makes me wonder how many of us have felt

01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:41.140
the same effect. That is the kind of question I pose to you three. I think it might be interesting

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.940
to hear the kinds of music you mix with the kinds of games that you play. Actually, just

01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:51.180
to say, I usually prefer the in-game music because I think that the games were... I...

01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:58.180
This is from being a musician myself. And actually being a person who is actually getting

01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:06.260
very much into experience and the identity of something, you know, has really been more

02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:11.100
recent transformation. But I think that the music is actually an integral part to the

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:16.260
game. It's part of what defines the action, part of what ties everything in together.

02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:20.620
And yeah, a crap soundtrack can break a game, but it's still part of the experience, you

02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:27.620
know. So in that respect, I prefer to try it at least a few times through with the original

02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:32.900
music. And then if I've played it for a while, then I might try to find something else. You

02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:38.100
know what I mean? Yeah, I rarely use custom soundtracks. As cool as they are, I rarely

02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:41.740
use them, I find, actually. They're for racing games. That's just what I was going to get

02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:46.180
into. It's a Ridge Racer game. Racing games, I always seem to use custom soundtracks with.

02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:50.660
And I like to do like driving type of techno, like, you know, boo boo boo boo boo boo. Just

02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:55.000
throw in the Won Gun CDs. It was serious. Actually, I've done that. I love playing

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.340
Burnout with the Won Gun music. It's pretty fun. But here's a curveball for you. One thing

02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:04.580
I like to do, World of Warcraft, obviously, you know I play that game. And you know, even

02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:08.060
though I agree pretty much with what Jamie said, the soundtrack to World of Warcraft

02:01:08.060 --> 02:01:12.100
gets a little old. You've kind of heard all the same songs over and over and over again.

02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:16.280
I like to listen to talk radio while I play World of Warcraft. There's a particular political

02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:20.340
talk show I listen to in the evenings. I like to listen to that and play World of Warcraft.

02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:23.900
And what I do is I have the talk show play through my headphones, and then I have WoW

02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:27.260
playing through my speakers, so I can kind of hear both, but I'm not being distracted

02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:31.860
by the game noises. That's actually kind of the way I've been gaming lately, like that.

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:35.980
But rarely, yeah, for the same reasons, especially with a lot of games coming out right now that

02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:39.740
have the very driving soundtracks like Space Invaders Xtreme and things like that that have

02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:45.740
the thumpin' soundtracks. I don't really like to switch it out.

02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:52.540
Yeah, sorry. If anyone picked that up, Rob's using my stylus as a mouse.

02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:58.780
It's fine. Now I'm fidgeting with it, even though it's super expensive. But yes. Anyway,

02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:02.980
that's pretty much my answer to the question, is that I do talk radio, if anything else.

02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:08.940
Well, there are some games that, just after having played them for a long time, I will

02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:12.740
listen to other stuff, but really it has to be something that I've played for a long time.

02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:17.720
Or actually, I'll do it when I play RO, because after a while, the music in-game really freakin'

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:18.720
gets on my nerves.

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:21.940
Yeah, I mean, a lot of MMOs, I'm sure, are like that, you know, just even if it's...

02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:24.780
But I didn't do it for other games. I didn't do it for World of Warcraft, and I didn't

02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:26.660
do it for Final Fantasy XI.

02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:30.500
You probably didn't play them enough. I didn't for the first year.

02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:33.420
I played long enough to know that I hated being a freakin' white mage!

02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:36.660
Alright, any more emails, or is that it?

02:02:36.660 --> 02:02:39.660
That, um, oh, there's more.

02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:40.660
Oh dear.

02:02:40.660 --> 02:02:41.660
Just a little more, just a little more.

02:02:41.660 --> 02:02:42.660
Alright.

02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:46.020
Well, that's all. I hope that this wasn't too long and that I used semicolons in a way

02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:49.740
that is effective and grammatically correct. After all, I didn't used to use that particular

02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:53.900
piece of punctuation in school. Thank you for your time, Reddertainment. This message

02:02:53.900 --> 02:03:00.580
has been brought to you by my Who Killed Amanda Palmer, the solo debut by Amanda Palmer, fucking

02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:04.220
awesome, and by Olive Garden, my grandma's favorite way to catch food poisoning.

02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:09.420
Alright, there you go. Free plug for an indie artist there, something worked in.

02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:10.740
I'm down for that.

02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:11.740
By the way, uh...

02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:13.420
Oh my god.

02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:14.420
What's that?

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:17.140
Amanda totally trumped my bacon ice cream.

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:18.340
What'd she get?

02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:19.340
Bacon cinnamon rolls.

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:20.340
That's pretty amazing.

02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:21.340
I don't know.

02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:22.340
Bacon dessert doesn't seem to go well.

02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:23.340
That looks delicious.

02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:24.340
Bacon is meat candy.

02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:25.340
Bacon is meat candy.

02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:26.340
Nice.

02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:27.340
.com.

02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:35.340
Alright. Is that registered yet? Bacon is meat candy dot com? Take a look. Alright,

02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:39.340
anyhow, I've been promising an all night long list giveaway.

02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:49.780
Smile DK, autographing a copy of Darren's Dance Revolution Supernova 2.

02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:54.820
The five songs we played on the last show we had two weeks ago, Don't Clock Me, Have

02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:59.380
You Never Been Mellow, the M.M. Groovin' mix. That was the faster mix of the song.

02:03:59.380 --> 02:04:03.580
In the Heat of the Night, Rain of Sorrow, and the song you just heard there in the background,

02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:06.820
Dancing All Alone. Those were the songs. Of course, we had to have a song in there by Smile

02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:13.500
DK. We had a few people get it right. I had Bobby, our buddy who is on before us, pick

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:19.980
a number, and he picked the number two. So we grabbed the second email, and the winner

02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:25.780
of the Smile DK autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2. This is a pretty big prize, so drum roll

02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:29.780
please, people please.

02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:36.060
The winner is, the winner does not have an alias, so the winner is Lindsay, Lindsay B.

02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:39.900
Send in an email that has the right songs all there. I don't know if she's listening

02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:44.340
right now, but there it is. Lindsay B. won. Congratulations. I will be sending you an

02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:50.700
email. Please make sure we get your address so we can tell Breslil where to send the prize.

02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:56.820
Lindsay B. wins the autographed Smile DK. So congrats. Congrats to you.

02:04:56.820 --> 02:05:00.500
All right. Let's get back into some gaming news then.

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.460
Do we gotta?

02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:03.460
Yes we gotta.

02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:04.460
Woohoo.

02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:13.660
Well, it's kind of funny. The DSi, you know, that system didn't seem to be, wasn't able

02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:22.740
to be hacked for a while there, but it was only for a while. Apparently a new DSi working

02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:32.580
cart from Supercard, they have a new one now, Supercard DS1i, and that actually now works

02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:38.300
with the DSi and, you know, features all the wonderful ways to get around their different

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:43.000
security measures, including all the future ones that may come, because they actually

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:48.500
have for the first time a way to update the firmware on the card. And this is independent

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:54.260
of actually, because usually with these cards you have to use a micro SD card and you, you

02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:57.900
know, run a program on there and you update the program and that kind of stuff. Well,

02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:03.340
now you can actually update the firmware on the card itself using the included USB adapter

02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:12.500
and so, in theory, this could be unpatchable at some point. And I know that there was some

02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:19.580
more information out there about some new methods that they're going to be implementing

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:26.580
in upcoming DSi games, and we'll get into more of that in a little bit, but that might

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:31.980
make that a little bit harder to work. Well, do we always kind of know, like, whenever

02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:38.500
they say something can't be pirated within five minutes, it is, right? Yeah. So, and

02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:44.500
Act F says it in chat right there, you can't stop the homebrew community. You just can't.

02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:49.700
So, I guess that's it then. DSi has already been cracked, and how long has it been out?

02:06:49.700 --> 02:06:55.940
Two weeks? Three weeks? Well, a little while if you count Japan. No, I guess that's true.

02:06:55.940 --> 02:06:59.900
Well, some more E3 news. We talked a lot about some great E3 news earlier in the show, but

02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:06.820
this not so great news. Well, depending on who you're a fan of. Atari, the once great

02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:14.100
makers of the 2600 system, a landmark in gaming, has pulled out of E3. Atari will not be attending

02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:20.940
E3 this year, so sadly, no Ghostbusters, Champions Online, or any of that on the show floor.

02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:25.540
Although Atari does still feel that E3 is beneficial to the industry, they are focused

02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:32.640
on quote, other selling and marketing initiatives. So, there you go. Sadly, Atari has pulled

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:38.140
out of the show. And what's interesting, Atari was always kind of like, every year I went

02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:43.140
to E3 anyway, Atari was always kind of a satellite room. They were never really on the show floor.

02:07:43.140 --> 02:07:46.800
Them and Midway always had satellite rooms. So, it'll be interesting to see what happens

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:52.640
this year. Oh, there you go. Let's hope Ghostbusters sells lots and lots of copies for Atari or

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:56.220
else who knows if they'll be in existence by this time next year for E3. That would

02:07:56.220 --> 02:08:01.780
be a very sad day. That would just be the end of an era. Indeed, but Sega not putting

02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:05.160
out hardware anymore was the end of an era of sorts. Well, you know, there's something

02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:11.980
else though that makes me think that Nintendo hasn't forgotten the sum of its earlier games.

02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:18.100
And it's a game that's called Muscle March, and that's just put out by Namco. It's a game

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:28.100
that's sort of like a puzzle game meets a Mario Kart meets some weird Simon Says sort

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:34.860
of game. Sunshine and rainbows. Oh, and muscle-bound men and an overly-muscled woman. Can I play

02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:38.320
a little bit of the trailer here? Does it have happy, sunshiny music to go with the

02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:49.540
little picture here? Let me fast forward a little bit here. Oh my gosh, this game looks

02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:56.340
silly. I'm getting it. I wish. This looks like Incredible Crisis, but with incredibly

02:08:56.340 --> 02:09:04.020
scantily clad muscle men. No, it's like, do you see how you have to pose the right way?

02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:11.260
It's human Tetris. Oh God, it's that thing. It's like that game show. Yeah. Oh my God.

02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:15.260
Ellen does this on her show all the time. Basically, the premise of this story starts

02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:21.620
off with a football player, like American football, stealing their protein powder. And

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:27.940
so they're chasing after the football player, and as you can see here, an alien takes it

02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:32.100
once they catch the football player. They have to chase after the alien. And basically

02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:36.860
the alien and the football player and the guys are running through different walls,

02:09:36.860 --> 02:09:41.220
and you have to pose the way he posed when you go through the wall. And there's a panda

02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:46.460
bear. Or, what was that? A polar bear. And there is a muscle woman, too, if you're looking

02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:51.540
for that. But they're running on rainbow trails. I mean, this game is too gay for me. This

02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:58.260
game totally reeks of Cho Aniki. Just without being a... I'll get this. And I'm completely

02:09:58.260 --> 02:10:04.980
secure in my homosexuality when I say that. This game looks way too gay for me. I want

02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:12.300
this game. Hey, it's what, only 800 Wii points? I guess so. And that's what, May 29th or something

02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:19.580
in Japan? Yep. So, in fact, I will actually link the article from Joystiq in the chat

02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:26.380
room so that our listeners who are with us live can see it. Bobby Blackwolf says they

02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:30.220
should put that on the box. You know how they always quote people from magazines and trade

02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:34.020
publications? They put it on the box. Even though this is a download title. They should

02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:38.200
put that right there on the box. This game is too gay for me. Rob Roberts. I would be

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:42.300
fine with that. I would be completely fine with that. I mean, I guess I should play it

02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:46.980
before I can definitively say that, but seriously, it's probably, if I were to play it, it would

02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:56.300
be even gayer. But it's... the game is... yeah. And there's also this particular place

02:10:56.300 --> 02:11:00.660
where it freezes the screen. There's a giraffe poking its head out of the clouds and a pig

02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:08.940
flying and muscle-bound men pointing. And gay sex. Lots of butt sex. Surprise butt sex.

02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:14.380
Ahh! That's the sound of surprise butt sex, by the way. That's the bonus level. Surprise!

02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:21.060
Yeah. Well, you think that's pretty surprising. Well then, here's something else that'll blow

02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:28.140
your mind. Apparently someone's actually... Yes, apparently someone has developed a pill

02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:35.420
that will enhance your first person shooter plane. It's called the FPS Brain Pill. And

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:45.140
apparently it will make you see better, I guess. It's a visual performance enhancing

02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:56.180
capsule. And I guess when caffeine and guarana are not enough. I don't know. For when staying

02:11:56.180 --> 02:12:02.380
up until 9 o'clock in the morning playing World of Warcraft just isn't long enough.

02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:08.900
Well this way you can see better. Maybe this will make you see dead people. Maybe this

02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:14.140
will give you a heart attack, is what might happen. I don't know. Deathwishing in the

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:21.820
chatroom asks, chat.orangessauce.com asks, so basically it's caffeine? No, it's not.

02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:26.740
It's made up of complex ingredients which nurture the human eye. Oh, well I'm sorry.

02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:32.620
With essential micronutrients that are not sufficiently produced by the body on its own.

02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:40.220
These and among other trace elements, plant extracts, cartonoids which strengthen and

02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:48.620
protect the eyes when they're under particular strain. Gamers often sit in front of their

02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:54.260
screens for hours during the night, especially for them. A sufficient nutrition of the body

02:12:54.260 --> 02:13:00.440
with vital substance that actively support the eyes as a precondition for healthy and

02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:06.940
effective eyesight. And blah blah blah. Actually, looking through this, these are basically

02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:15.300
the same things that you find in those eye formulas. There's actually some really good

02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:19.900
stuff in here, but really lutein, lycopene, eat a tomato, shit. Eat a tomato every day.

02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:26.180
You'll be fine. Or take a multivitamin. Multivitamins don't have quite that concentration. It's

02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:31.580
still a way to get gamers to take their vitamins, you know, just eat a fucking tomato. Well,

02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:35.500
you can buy it and they have a 110% money back guarantee, so if you don't like it, then

02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:45.300
you get more money. Cool! I don't like it. Prenatal vitamins. Alright, wait, are you

02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:50.140
suggesting gamers should take prenatal vitamins? Actually, the stuff that's in prenatal vitamins

02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:55.260
are pretty freaking good for, you know, keeping the body healthy and hand-eye coordination.

02:13:55.260 --> 02:14:00.140
Also, it's really good for your hair. Okay, as long as I don't get pregnant. No! That

02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:06.060
has got to be the single most dumb buddy thing I've ever heard you say. Really? Because I've

02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:12.540
said a lot in the history of this program. I've said, shut up! I've said a lot of dumb

02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:19.020
things. Oh, but that's not all. See, that's FBS brain zoom. That's the, um, that, but

02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:24.540
apparently they also have some other stuff that enhances your reaction time, the FBS

02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:31.100
brain original. Fortunately, they do not sell anything that will enhance your penis size.

02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:34.980
That's the only thing they're really missing. I'm gonna tell everybody, all of our listeners,

02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:40.820
something right now. These ads are bullshit! These products that say they're gonna do this

02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:47.420
shit, they don't do it! But 110% money back guarantee! That's a guarantee you can stick

02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:54.780
by! Hey, you get 110% back! That's more than 100%! And I'm not saying this as a representative

02:14:54.780 --> 02:15:02.180
of the company. I did work at a GNC, and I've been involved in several natural home remedy,

02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:07.500
you know, courses. I do believe in natural healing, but none of this stuff is gonna be

02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:14.100
an instant fix. The way you improve your hand-eye coordination is using your hands and eyes

02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:19.540
together more. You coordinate them through practice. Um, faster reaction times are gonna

02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:23.260
be done through training. It's not something that a pill's gonna do for you. And there

02:15:23.260 --> 02:15:31.620
is absolutely zero, no way to grow a bigger dick. It doesn't happen. You cannot use a

02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:37.980
vacuum tube. You cannot use pills. You could do it surgically. That's about it. And that's

02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:39.780
not you growing it.

02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:45.340
Alright. Well, there is no pill that will make you a better dancer. That's for sure,

02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:47.380
right? There's no pill that will make you a better dancer.

02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:49.460
I know plenty of people who could use it if it existed.

02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:53.380
But possibly Dance Dance Revolution will make you a better dancer, although I'll tell you

02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:57.240
from first-hand experience it does not. But if you want to try anyway, there might be

02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:01.360
a game coming out a little later for you this year that could be a good starter kit. It's

02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:06.280
Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1 is apparently the game. Of course, take this with a grain

02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:09.780
of salt. Konami's not confirming this yet, but apparently some information's leaked out

02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:15.540
this week that the Wii will be getting this game as well as the Xbox 360 and a debut on

02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:21.180
the PlayStation 3. Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1, it's a best of. That's right, they

02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:27.860
are going to be pulling some of the best songs from DDR's history and putting it all into

02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:32.700
one game. Here's hoping it's not just the Konami originals, because we did already have

02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:36.100
that game several years ago. It was called Konamiics, but I guess it was the first.

02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:40.700
And best hits. Best hits didn't come out in the US. I know, but it's still the same thing.

02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:45.860
I know, this is a little snore, you know, but I guess it's a starter kit for new people,

02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:50.780
whatever. Way to go. That took no effort. You didn't have to have any more, you know,

02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:54.580
step charts made. You just said, okay, I want this, this, this, this, this. Let's say it's

02:16:54.580 --> 02:17:01.300
Konami originals, we can take all that. And we're done. By the way, I just want to say

02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:05.020
Chat is kind of going a little haywire right now. We do tape live on Sunday nights and

02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:08.900
live things happen. Apparently there's just been an earthquake in Southern California.

02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:13.980
Some of our Southern California listeners are saying, whoa, did you feel that one? So

02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:18.980
they're saying on the quake site, it was a 4.7, which I don't believe is too bad. That's

02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:23.620
just a little wake up call. Let's hope this doesn't, this isn't a, what do they call it?

02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:27.880
A pre-quake or what? No, not an aftershock, but a pre-shock to something that's going

02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:31.540
to happen in three weeks. Cause that would suck. I don't know. Don't die. I don't want

02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:39.860
to be in LA when fear not. It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over. Shut up. She lives

02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:45.440
in Florida anyway. Exactly. It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over dark soccer. Please

02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:53.860
save this show from a Loki. There's going to be another Tony Hawk game. Who cares? Actually,

02:17:53.860 --> 02:18:01.580
this is going to be a peripheral based game and, um, it's going to be called, um, Tony

02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:11.140
Hawk Ride. And yeah, this thing is weird. It's going to be on Wii, PS3, and 360. So

02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:17.500
I don't know. I don't really care. Hitstone would like you to know that he cares. There

02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:23.820
you go. Okay. Then you can go check out the official website at thride.com. Yes. And it's

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:31.420
a big old skateboard controller as rumored numerous times before. No one's surprised.

02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:35.180
Yeah. Um, I, I'm like, when I heard this this week, I was like, I thought we already heard

02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:40.000
this, but I guess it was just kinda under the radar before. But, uh, yep. Yet another

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.940
peripheral to fill up your house. There you go. A skateboard controller. Maybe I'll have

02:18:43.940 --> 02:18:48.900
to get it on top of the boxes. I knew it. Dark soccer. The minute she hears, Oh, peripheral.

02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:53.780
She's like, ah, fuck. I got to get this. No, the only way, you know what? There is one

02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:57.580
game. I would have wanted something like that for, and that was, what was it called? Air

02:18:57.580 --> 02:19:03.260
tricks. The Sega skateboarding game. That would have been cool. Otherwise, no, you know

02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:07.620
what? They should put out the skateboard controller and then they should put out jet set radio,

02:19:07.620 --> 02:19:14.380
like a new version of it. Would that not, especially with the Wii, huh? Hey, except

02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:23.900
you are roller bleeding. You know what? Hater haters to the left, please. Thank you. So

02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:30.780
that it's a sequel. Now they're on skateboards. It's a little different. That is lame. I hate

02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:35.740
you. Just a couple more stories. Then we'll be taking your phone calls. A one eight seven

02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:42.100
seven game. Oh, LR. Not just yet though. Let you know when. So, um, as I alluded to earlier,

02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:47.900
they're a metaphoric. They're, um, I guess a former game developer, and now they're frustrated

02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:55.300
by piracy. So they have come up with a new, um, technique that will basically, um, allow

02:19:55.300 --> 02:20:00.020
each game that's put out to have a different security scheme. And it basically turns the

02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:06.260
game into its own security system. And it apparently does a check with some data that's

02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:11.260
stored on the cart. Something that's going to be broken really fast, basically, but will

02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:16.920
hopefully delay releases and that kind of stuff. I don't think it's going to, but not

02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:22.280
related to the story. And I'm going to bring it up anyways right now. We may have talked

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:29.260
about it a little bit before Kojima Productions has a new teaser page for some secret project.

02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:36.420
And wouldn't you know it? There is something that looks like a five or possibly an S. So

02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:44.020
we're either going to get a snatcher game or maybe Metal Gear Solid 5. Uh oh. With a

02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:50.740
new countdown. And maybe that's what they're going to show on the, uh, the press conference

02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:54.620
that they're saying, you know, if, you know. Dude, you know they're going to fucking do

02:20:54.620 --> 02:21:04.060
it. Maybe. I don't know. Who knows? We'll see. Interesting. Alright. Well, one more

02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:07.420
story for you guys and it's one more big, big, big rumor and then we're going to get

02:21:07.420 --> 02:21:12.940
to the calls. This could be interesting. A digital entertainment handheld that they say

02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:20.060
will do absolutely everything if you are to believe the rumors about the Zune HD. That's

02:21:20.060 --> 02:21:25.980
right. Uh, it was a report from Team Xbox apparently. The Zune HD allegedly is going

02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:31.320
to be revealed at E3. It's a portable game console and media player. It will link to

02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:37.100
the Skybox, another Microsoft system. It will integrate current Zune and Xbox marketplaces

02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:42.460
together and apparently something very similar to the NXC is going to be the function that

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:48.240
kind of drives the handheld. So in a way it's their foray into handheld gaming but not really

02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:52.740
because it's still kind of like an iPod-ish type of device. It's still the Zune. But here's

02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:57.460
the other big catch and this is why I'm kind of like, you know, very skeptical about this.

02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:02.100
Personally, the Zune HD, you will also be able to play Xbox Live Arcade games either

02:22:02.100 --> 02:22:06.660
on your Xbox or your handheld. That's where I stop believing that this is true. I think

02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:12.140
that's too much. Well, no. It's not necessarily too much. Only certain games. It's not all

02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:18.060
games. Maybe certain newer games that are developed with both together. You know, just

02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:24.140
like the XNA stuff. The XNA stuff you can develop for the Zune and for Xbox Live Arcade

02:22:24.140 --> 02:22:27.820
and you use that same toolset but now you have that full Xbox Live Arcade games that

02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:32.380
are cross-compatible. I would believe that the XNA games would run on this but I don't

02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:36.320
know. I mean, they have some pretty elaborate shit on Xbox Live Arcade now. I just can't

02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:39.980
imagine you're going to have something with the power of an Xbox 360 in your pocket. You

02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:48.980
know how much noise that'll make? I mean, but really. So. We'll see. Frisbee is mad

02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:53.020
that everything's getting called HD. He says, quit calling everything HD. Blah, blah, blah

02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:58.820
HD. That is kind of a generic name. Don't you think Microsoft could do better than that?

02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:02.340
Especially if they're calling their other thing the Fluid? Couldn't they call this the

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:08.420
Zune Fluid or something? I don't know. It makes me think of P. Don't talk about that.

02:23:08.420 --> 02:23:12.380
I actually have to kind of go to the restroom and we got to take calls. So, we're going

02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:17.780
to open up the Skype line now for your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is

02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:23.300
OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:28.380
Whoa, it's freezing up. Hi, it's freezing up. What's freezing up? Are you having another

02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:34.900
earthquake? Whoa, no. It's springing, but I'm called in. Oh, there we go. Hi, introduce

02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:39.940
yourself for our listeners, please. It's Deathwishing. Hi, Deathwishing. Talk to Jamie while I go

02:23:39.940 --> 02:23:46.380
to the bathroom. Hi. Quick, follow him in there. We can tackle him. That's okay. I'd

02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:52.700
rather not because the cat also uses that bathroom. So, what's up? Fuel. That racing

02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:57.580
game? Yeah. Fuel? Yeah, it's awesome. Or it looks awesome. Oh, I don't know. I'm on a

02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:03.020
pre-order thing here and I can't decide which game to pre-order. It is Red Faction Guerrilla

02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:10.260
or Fuel and that looks like Motorstorm on steroids and then Red Faction's Red Faction.

02:24:10.260 --> 02:24:17.100
Well, it depends if you want a racing game or more of like, you know, a sandbox-y game.

02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:27.580
Or do I want Global Warming or Mars? Yeah. Global Warming for the win, I think. Yay.

02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:35.020
On the other part, we need to strap down Rosie O'Donnell just to get that thought out. I'm

02:24:35.020 --> 02:24:41.500
trying to think here, a little bit of shocker over here, you know what happened, but I'm

02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:48.860
still playing Street Fighter. I think that's all we need to know. Cool. Yeah. Who's actually

02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:57.400
your primary now? Primary? Yeah, entry-fighter. Your main person. Sagat. Sagat now. Really?

02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:07.020
Any particular reason? Tiger uppercut. Is that all? Oh, and Tiger Knee. Looks like he's

02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:13.180
kicking him in the balls. Just way more hardcore. I'm still totally taken with using Sakura,

02:25:13.180 --> 02:25:19.580
of course. That's because your name's Dark Sakura. If she played more like the one from

02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:28.820
SNK vs. Capcom with a really weird run into her uppercut, it'd be really cool. I haven't

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:37.060
noticed that. She plays a lot like an interesting combination of Alpha 2, Alpha 3. Well, Street

02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:43.540
Fighter IV is my first real Street Fighter. What do you want, lazy? Go back and play Alpha

02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:52.640
2. But I'm a young kid. I have to stick with the young games. It makes me hip. That means

02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:56.820
you're doing research. You know what? Respect your elders. Hi, I'm back. Respect your elders.

02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:01.940
You need to discover your roots of gaming. Seriously, go back and play Alpha 2. Young

02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:09.500
whippersnappers. Road Rash is better than every game out. Says you. Alright, says me.

02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:16.860
What did I miss? You missed me wanting to tie down Rosie O'Donnell. Wait, are you in

02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:22.980
L.A., Death Wishing? Hainton Beach. So close enough, did you feel that earthquake? I ran

02:26:22.980 --> 02:26:29.660
down the stairs. Wow, so it was pretty bad then, huh? Right as you guys were talking

02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:34.720
about the first person shooter pill, which, like I said, I have permanent eye improvement

02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:41.980
called glasses. You put them on and you get better vision. Some people in chat asked if

02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:45.300
we felt the earthquake, but we're way too far away to feel an earthquake. Like the big

02:26:45.300 --> 02:26:50.100
one could hit L.A. and we wouldn't feel it up here. Another gamer pill is called carrots.

02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:56.460
They help your eyesight. Carrots are pretty amazing, actually. And they do have pills

02:26:56.460 --> 02:27:01.060
out there, actually, that's just carrots. Just make sure you get the right hole. But

02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:08.980
if you eat, wow, if you eat too many carrots, your face will turn orange. This is true.

02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:12.220
This happened to me when I was a kid. I want to look like an Oompa Loompa. It happened

02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:19.860
to this person, too. Did you ever watch the Partridge Family? Danny Bonaduce? No, Susan

02:27:19.860 --> 02:27:24.500
Day. Really? Yeah, she pretty much starved herself and ate nothing but carrots and she

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:27.820
turned orange. This kid has no idea what the Partridge Family was. Do you know what the

02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:34.980
Partridge Family is? Huh? Oh, God. All right. Do you have any final thoughts before I let

02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:44.980
you go? Should I pre-order Fuel or Red Faction Gorilla? Red Faction Gorilla. Okay. All right,

02:27:44.980 --> 02:27:51.880
bye. I'll see about that. Okay, but thanks, bye. I don't know, I just picked a better

02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:55.680
sounding one. I have no idea what those games are. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's

02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:01.380
this? Hey, C1LE Ronmo. What's up, everyone? Hi, not much. I was just yelling at the previous

02:28:01.380 --> 02:28:05.800
listener. Please tell me you know who the Partridge Family is. I grew up watching the

02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:11.780
Partridge Family. Come on, get happy. There's a song that we're singing. Don't. Come on,

02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:15.380
get happy. All right, come on. Everybody knows that one. All right, Ronmo, what's on your

02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:22.440
mind tonight, buddy? Did you Twitter from the bathroom? I did not Twitter from the bathroom.

02:28:22.440 --> 02:28:27.740
I left my phone in here, thank you very much. Okay, all right, all right, all right. It

02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:33.940
was just a pee, too. It wasn't a poop, so it's a lot harder to Twitter while you pee.

02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:38.180
And I'm afraid of getting the phone wet, so I wouldn't want to do that. You got a point

02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:48.060
there. I always have a point. The chat room's like, ah. Whatever. Anyhow, what's on your

02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:54.340
mind? Shirley, you didn't just call and ask me about my bathroom. Call him Shirley. Or

02:28:54.340 --> 02:29:02.300
Shirley. Speak. Okay, last week I helped a friend download Patapon 2, and it kind of

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:07.620
blew up in our faces. Like the game literally blew up in your face, or what happened? It

02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:14.660
was being held trying to download the software to our PFE. I don't understand. Like, what

02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:19.180
happened? All right, pretty much, we hooked it up to my laptop. I'm running Windows 7,

02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:24.060
so I figured, okay, it'll download. The Sony software stopped halfway and said, I'm running

02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:29.020
an unauthorized operating system, this will now shut down. After doing that twice, we

02:29:29.020 --> 02:29:34.500
went to an XP machine, started downloading everything, it started running, we downloaded

02:29:34.500 --> 02:29:41.380
Patapon, we walked out, we come back, the download timed out. Interesting. Why don't

02:29:41.380 --> 02:29:48.020
you try downloading it through the PSP? The funny thing is, it wouldn't let her update

02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:53.300
the firmware, she was running version 3.7 or something like that. Holy crap. Yeah, and

02:29:53.300 --> 02:29:58.220
we tried to update the firmware, and it was like, it says you're running the latest one.

02:29:58.220 --> 02:30:01.240
Well it sounds like Sony's gonna sell tons of copies of this stuff with all these hurdles

02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:07.400
going on. I bet I can get that game faster then. This almost sounds like a challenge.

02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:11.980
Is it faster to download Patapon 2 legally or illegally? This should be like a challenge

02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:18.020
we do on the show next week. That might be fun. Not for nothing, it took me like 30 minutes

02:30:18.020 --> 02:30:23.660
to pull down Rock Band Unplugged. Did you finally get your copy of Patapon 2, or are

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:27.420
you still kind of waiting? We got it for her, and she was really pissed about it because

02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:33.260
she didn't even realize that it was a downloadable title when she bought it. Oh, I see, she

02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:39.980
bought it at the store? Okay, gotcha. Interesting, well thanks for the heads up. I could probably

02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:44.140
have it in a minute, but I'm not going to. Do not waste the bandwidth in here. Alright,

02:30:44.140 --> 02:30:48.660
so anyway, Rama, anything else you want to call in about tonight? Rock Band Unplugged

02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:55.820
is pretty good, and Rob, in response to 9 people in the hotel room at ASEN, need I remind

02:30:55.820 --> 02:31:01.220
you about Katakan? Yeah, but that room at Katakan was much bigger. Like, you had a suite

02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:07.460
at Katakan. We're talking like a standard two bed room at ASEN. I have stayed in rooms

02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:13.820
where they fed 15 people in there, and people sleep on shifts. I've done it. Oh my god,

02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:21.740
now I'm just, I'm too old for this. You know, no, I mean, and certainly no disrespect, I

02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:25.740
had a lot of fun, and you know, I did finally get my sleep, but you know, I definitely,

02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:28.800
you know, somebody said they could kind of see it in me on Saturday. I was definitely

02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:33.040
feeling tired just because, you know, so many people and so on, so it took me a while to

02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:38.620
catch up. I was so dead at work on Monday and Tuesday, it was not even funny. Like,

02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:42.140
I took like a five hour nap. It was pretty disgusting. Did you call out because you had

02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:46.900
the comp leg? No, I couldn't. You know, in my job, you can't really call in sick unless

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:52.020
you are like really, really sick, especially when you have huge important projects that

02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:57.620
have to be done when you teach, so. Oh, okay. Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you

02:31:57.620 --> 02:32:01.420
go so we can get some more calls, but have a good one, and hopefully the next convention

02:32:01.420 --> 02:32:08.980
I go to, you'll be there. Most definitely. Alright, take care, buddy. Later. Later. 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:32:08.980 --> 02:32:12.420
our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but the calls are coming in back to back tonight.

02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:17.020
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D. Rob, how you

02:32:17.020 --> 02:32:21.860
doing? Not too shabby. Just got home from work, and I'm like, oh my God, has OrangeLoungeRadio

02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:25.980
taken calls yet? I don't know. We just started taking calls. You're just in time. I did talk

02:32:25.980 --> 02:32:29.820
earlier in the show, and I did congratulate you on your Street Fighter IV win at ASUM.

02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:33.900
Thank you very much. And was talking a little bit about the experience in the hotel room

02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:38.520
playing on the Xbox 360 and the two arcade sticks, which actually was a lot of fun. I

02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:42.380
almost want to get an arcade stick. They're nice. I mean, I never thought I'd be one of

02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:45.540
those guys who actually takes arcade sticks, and I despise myself just a little bit more

02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:49.740
as a human being, just for actually being one of those people who uses an arcade stick,

02:32:49.740 --> 02:32:55.940
but it's worth it. How did your panel go? I never got to ask. It went really well. I

02:32:55.940 --> 02:32:59.780
mean, people really got a huge kick out of it, and we ended up getting pretty much in

02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:06.140
almost full room at the biggest panel room at the convention, short of the main programming

02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:10.760
area where they have thousands of seats and that sort of thing. That's amazing. Congratulations.

02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:15.260
I have to admit I'm a little jealous. And I actually just found out that I have a panel

02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:19.700
at Otacon, so that's going to be interesting. Wow. Well, go you. I mean, the stuff I saw,

02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:23.380
I didn't get to see the panel. I wish you guys would have taped it or something, but

02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:30.140
I do have a tape. It's not great quality because it was taken on a really small digital camera.

02:33:30.140 --> 02:33:36.940
I think Misty taped it. Misty gave it to one of Jason, the crazy kid's brothers. Gotcha.

02:33:36.940 --> 02:33:41.380
I have the video. I think I'm going to end up subtitling it and seeing how that turns

02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:45.060
out because you can hardly hear anything. Or if you're going to do the same thing at

02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:48.900
the next panel, take a better camera next time. Be ready. Be ready with a video camera.

02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:53.740
It would be fun. Oh, yeah. But that's great. The stuff I saw, tell the listeners, because

02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:56.620
we're talking about this panel. Nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about. Tell the

02:33:56.620 --> 02:34:01.060
listeners a little bit about what you did at this panel that had a full crowd. Well,

02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:06.140
last year when we went to Otacon, we saw this Sonic the Hedgehog panel, and I laugh if they

02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:09.580
actually listen to this, although I doubt it. And they did a terrible, terrible job.

02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:13.640
The whole thing was basically the people who did it took a timeline of the Sonic games

02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:17.780
and was like, oh, and then Sonic Shovel came out. Who doesn't remember Sonic Shovel? And

02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:21.660
then everyone would go, woo! And that was pretty much it. And it sucked. So we decided,

02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:25.780
okay, if they're going to do bad video game panels, let's make a good video game panel.

02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:29.180
And we realized, what would people actually want to hear about? What would people laugh

02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:34.380
at that they don't really know about? So we decided to compile a list of some of the worst

02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:39.340
writing and some of the worst examples of video game tropes. And we decided to do a

02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:45.540
little presentation about it and compile an hour-long thing about it with slides, with

02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:49.820
pre-written stuff. And it turned out really well. We have a whole section on stupid Mega

02:34:49.820 --> 02:34:54.300
Man robot masters, bad video game covers, the introduction of Blaster Master and the

02:34:54.300 --> 02:35:00.900
Americanization of it, where instead of having this basic storyline of this guy battling

02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:05.900
in a post-apocalyptic world in this Gundam, well, not Gundam-style tank, but in this whole

02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:09.580
one technologically advanced tank that's so much better than everything else, how they

02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:16.140
localize that into this kid is chasing after his giant frog that just turned giant because

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:20.420
this radioactive box that just happened to be in his front yard. And he decided to jump

02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:25.460
down a hole and find this tank and start blowing up this underground society he knows nothing

02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:31.680
about. It's great, really. And this is completely true? Yes. Wow. And see, the thing is that

02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:36.420
I love Blaster Master. It's one of my favorite NES games, definitely my top five. And I never

02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:41.580
knew this. I just never thought to research it. I just accepted the FX9 novelization as

02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:47.860
gospel and never realized there was this whole other real story behind it. It's amazing.

02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:51.820
Yeah, it's hilarious. And like I said, we did a huge list of it. And actually, we still

02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:56.260
have material left over. And we've actually even gotten some good ideas from some of the

02:35:56.260 --> 02:36:00.300
people attending our panel as well. We always ask at the end to see if anyone has anything

02:36:00.300 --> 02:36:04.100
else. Honestly, if we wanted to do a two-hour panel and wanted to put in the work for that,

02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:09.980
we probably could. So you're traveling video game comics. This is pretty amazing. Yeah,

02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:14.100
it's fun so far. We'll see how long we do it and how many cons we can do it at. Basically,

02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:17.940
if you'll give us a free badge and we can find cheap hotel, we'll do it. Well, hey,

02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:23.280
there you go. You know what? Maybe we need to start working on something for Fanime 2010.

02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:29.280
We want to, but California's a little bit far away from us Illinois boys. Take a look

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:34.340
at Southwest out of Midway. They have some direct flights. We'll work on that for next

02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:39.860
year. All right, do that. Anyhow, Rob D, any other con thoughts or thoughts in general

02:36:39.860 --> 02:36:45.260
you want to share tonight? Oh man, the convention was a lot of fun. Actually, it's funny. After

02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:49.060
finals, because I had a couple finals to take right after, I really just need another break

02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:52.340
from reality. So I'm actually going to be going to Anime North, although I have no panel

02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:57.580
this weekend. You're just a blood for punishment with these two. I'm a con whore at this point.

02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:02.980
I have nothing else to say about that. It'll be my first trip to Canada in a good 10 years.

02:37:02.980 --> 02:37:08.060
Part of me, even though I'm not doing anything at Fanime, I do kind of want to go just to

02:37:08.060 --> 02:37:11.740
kind of peek. Part of me thinks I might end up there at least one day just kind of looking

02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:15.860
around because I'm supposed to be in the Bay Area anyway. But we'll see. We'll see. I'm

02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:20.500
a little iffy right now. Maybe they'll have a game room that doesn't have half the TVs

02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:26.380
turned off. Fanime always has a really good game room, actually. So we'll see. We'll see.

02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:31.960
But I have a lot going on next weekend. We'll see. There's a lot. Rob, any other thoughts

02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:32.960
for our listeners before I let you go?

02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:35.860
Well, I'd love to talk about Tatsunoko versus Capcom and how we're actually getting some

02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:40.580
Tatsu with some, you know, I can play as Ryu and Ken. Oh, wait. Wait, not that Ken. But

02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:46.380
no, I'm excited for that coming to the U.S. or at least very, you know, almost confirmed

02:37:46.380 --> 02:37:47.380
for the U.S. if nothing else.

02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:51.580
Now, since you just joined us, did you hear that they have kind of looked at one of the

02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:55.860
screenshots and you can tell that three characters have already been axed, which we kind of figured

02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:58.500
was going to, you know, we said when we were kind of talking about this earlier in the

02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:03.140
show, we were like, well, wait a minute. Maybe they got the licensing, but don't guarantee

02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:07.440
that they got all of it. And sure enough, three of the characters have been cut, apparently.

02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:10.700
That's interesting. I didn't know about that. I'll have to look into that. But I guess it's

02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:14.460
not too surprising considering that's just a nightmare in the U.S. and any other country

02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:15.460
other than Japan.

02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:18.940
Exactly. And folks are asking again which characters got axed. Do you remember, Loki,

02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:21.340
or where you read that? Do you remember who the ones were?

02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:23.740
One of them was Condorno Joe.

02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:33.260
It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and... I don't remember the last one.

02:38:33.260 --> 02:38:36.580
R something real. Riolo? I don't remember.

02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:37.580
Yeah, Ryu.

02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:38.580
Exactly, Ryu.

02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:39.580
No, not Ryu.

02:38:39.580 --> 02:38:40.580
Ryu won't be in there.

02:38:40.580 --> 02:38:41.580
Licensing for Ryu.

02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:44.060
Somebody in chat will yell it out in just a moment. That's what usually happens once

02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:45.700
they get through the delay.

02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:49.580
Will Kiyop from Battle of the Planets be in there or Ace Goodheart from G-Force?

02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:50.580
Sorry.

02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:52.580
I don't think everybody else is still in there.

02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:53.580
We'll see.

02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:59.500
Anyway, Rob, we better let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks for the call

02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:03.300
and congratulations again and good luck with your traveling band of comedy.

02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:05.260
Thank you very much. I'll see you later.

02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:08.420
All right. Take care, buddy.

02:39:08.420 --> 02:39:13.740
We got time for a couple more calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:39:13.740 --> 02:39:18.180
We can probably squeeze at least one more call in before the night's up. Go ahead and

02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:21.740
give us a call. Do we have any last minute stories real quick before we say good night?

02:39:21.740 --> 02:39:23.740
Yes, I've been collecting them.

02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:28.540
Hold on. We got a call. Hi, Aaron. OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:39:28.540 --> 02:39:29.540
It's GS68.

02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:33.980
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:37.260
Don't bother responding to me next year. I think ASEN needs more of your attention.

02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:38.260
Wait. What's this?

02:39:38.260 --> 02:39:46.340
Don't bother responding to me. Nobody in front of Bay Area was able to overlap with me.

02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:49.980
I know. We've skipped out on the past two years. It just hasn't worked out, but dude,

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:53.580
ASEN is expensive to go to. I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it again next

02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:56.180
year, so I definitely want to keep it local, I think.

02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:08.060
Well, at least listeners would go to ASEN, but I don't know anyone who would go to...

02:40:08.060 --> 02:40:13.100
I know anyone who would go to find me if all of them wasn't doing it on our panel.

02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:16.780
Well, if we plugged it more because we're going, we might get it. The one year we did

02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:22.780
do a panel, we had an okay turnout. It was nice. It was cool to meet some people. Plus,

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:26.580
something else to consider, there's a lot of our old DDR buddies are really involved

02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:30.060
with Fonami, which is why I'm not going to talk negative about the con because I have

02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:32.780
nothing negative to say. It's just the timing never seems to work out because they do it

02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:35.160
on a really busy weekend.

02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:40.700
But a lot of our old DDR buddies are very heavily involved with Fonami. Wendell is still

02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:47.700
holding down the fort at stage zero, right? And I know, I can't remember his online name.

02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:53.700
I'm getting called out from the DDR scene. I haven't played DDR regularly in a long time.

02:40:53.700 --> 02:41:01.140
Yeah, so we'll definitely make it back probably next year because next year also is I'm trying

02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:06.500
to plan. I don't know if it's really going to happen, but I'm having an idea for a Japan

02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:10.780
tour dangled in front of me and I kind of want to do it. So it just depends on money

02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:16.860
and all that's good stuff. But if I do that, then no trips to the Midwest next year or

02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:19.980
even probably the East Coast because Japan will.

02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:26.180
I will be mostly doing a con report during the con or the week after and also be leaving

02:41:26.180 --> 02:41:29.700
updates on Twitter about the con at Fonami.

02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:32.300
What you're going to have to do, you're going to have to get some more listeners while you're

02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:33.300
at the show.

02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:34.300
Hopefully.

02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:43.060
I also want to talk about like last week or so, there's a new version of a version that

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:49.700
P3GameNet really plugged on the mailbag several episodes ago and it has speedrun mode after

02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:50.700
you beat the games.

02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:51.700
Wait.

02:41:51.700 --> 02:41:52.700
They got me thinking.

02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:55.940
Sorry, which game is this?

02:41:55.940 --> 02:42:03.140
A version. It's a QT platformer game where you run around like chains of walls and collect

02:42:03.140 --> 02:42:04.140
gems.

02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:05.140
It's okay.

02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:09.020
Yeah, there's a new version where after you beat the games, there's a time attack mode

02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:13.860
and they got me thinking, more games where you, that kind of stuff. I mean, it kind of,

02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:18.700
I mean, it didn't mean to play the game again.

02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:22.180
You know, it's kind of cool. It's kind of cool when they will patch in new modes like

02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:26.140
that and new features to really extend the game's life because yeah, I mean, it gets

02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:30.780
people excited to kind of pop in a game they might've ignored again and go back to. Burnout

02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:36.460
Paradise, excellent example of a game that's been doing this very, very well.

02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:40.740
I know people that bought Burnout Paradise, sold it back, and then bought it again to

02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:43.820
play the download content.

02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:49.020
And on that topic, it hurts me when people say, oh, stop speedrunning the game or stop

02:42:49.020 --> 02:42:55.700
playing for score. Just have fun. I mean, there are ones now telling it, impeding on

02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:00.420
the fun of people like me who like to play for time or for score and there's some people

02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:06.780
playing for score for time is fun. So these kind of people just need to let everyone play

02:43:06.780 --> 02:43:07.660
their own way.

02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:11.700
It's your fucking quarter. Do what you want. Everyone else can buzz off. As long as you're

02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:16.140
not breaking a machine or doing things, just do what you want. It's your quarter.

02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:20.300
Yeah. Last week I was in another chat room and I was talking about guitar heroes scoring

02:43:20.300 --> 02:43:26.220
how the whole multiplier thing and someone was yelling the thing. No, nobody cares about

02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:31.700
the score. You're the guitar hero. Go play the music and I'm like, okay, but what about

02:43:31.700 --> 02:43:33.340
the people who do play for score?

02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:38.060
It's like Perfect Attack versus Freestyle and DDR. People just are into what they're

02:43:38.060 --> 02:43:42.660
into. If you want to really impress me, do both at the same time. There you go. I'd get

02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:46.860
to see that, a Perfect Attack freestyle. That'd be pretty awesome.

02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:50.940
I should maybe provide Poppin' Music freestyle.

02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:55.620
Oh, God. Poppin' Music freestyle. I don't know about that one, especially because there

02:43:55.620 --> 02:44:00.340
hasn't been any consumer one in a long time. I know. It was in a movie once, like a couple

02:44:00.340 --> 02:44:02.020
years ago. They had some guy doing-

02:44:02.020 --> 02:44:03.020
Was that lost in translation?

02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:08.740
Yeah, yeah. It was lost in translation, but yeah, there hasn't been a lot of movement

02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:11.740
in that scene in a while, but also keep in mind, there's been no Poppin' Music consumer

02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:16.340
style in quite a while, so it's kind of a-

02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:23.900
Yeah. We haven't seen- Yeah, Poppin' is going through what I call 2DX consumer syndrome

02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:31.660
style. It's usually between 2DX and 6 on PS2, and then another delay between 6 and 7.

02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:38.420
Oh, yeah. I remember that. It could be. It could be, but if Konami were smart, they would

02:44:38.420 --> 02:44:42.580
just nuke all of their franchises and start them over again on PlayStation 3 or next-gen

02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:46.460
hardware. PlayStation 3 would be good, because then you can import that. There you go. It'd

02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:47.460
be nice.

02:44:47.460 --> 02:44:52.260
I don't think it started on Poppin' last October, so it'll be nice if it could be 15 and 16

02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:58.260
on PS2. Maybe have a single compilation, so that way the series will be caught up.

02:44:58.260 --> 02:45:02.300
We'll see. I mean, the rumor is the next 2DX on PlayStation 2 is just going to have a crap

02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:06.220
load of songs, but rumors are rumors. We'll see. Anyway, JSXTO, we've got to let you go.

02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:10.780
We need to go and wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call, and have fun at Fandame,

02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:12.420
and we expect a full report next week.

02:45:12.420 --> 02:45:13.900
All right. Okay. Bye.

02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:18.140
Take care. All right. That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight. I'm so sorry to

02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:20.740
those that didn't get through. I know some of you folks wanted to call in and talk about

02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:25.060
other things, but it just happened. Sometimes we get slammed on the phone line, so there

02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:26.060
you have it.

02:45:26.060 --> 02:45:29.100
We've got to get out of here, though. It's going to be a late night. We've been here

02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:34.220
since 6 o'clock. It's already 9-12. We still have the live-only segment in a little bit,

02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:37.820
and all that other stuff, so we've got to tie it all up and get out of here, but first,

02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:40.500
other last-minute stories before we pull the plug on tonight's show.

02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:48.140
Oh, yeah. I got a ton. Anyways, so where was I? Oh, so apparently there's a rumor that

02:45:48.140 --> 02:45:52.820
Battlefield Heroes is going to be headed to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Network, and

02:45:52.820 --> 02:45:58.100
Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade. As you remember, I believe Battlefield Heroes is the free-to-play

02:45:58.100 --> 02:46:05.980
game that they have online, a kind of a deathmatch-only flair, but apparently it's listed as coming

02:46:05.980 --> 02:46:13.140
out in June 2009, according to EA's press page, and perhaps this is something they're

02:46:13.140 --> 02:46:22.180
going to be talking about during E3, maybe. Might be neat.

02:46:22.180 --> 02:46:34.040
Also for Wii Sports Resort, there's been two more games revealed from a Japanese commercial.

02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:39.660
Apparently golf and table tennis will be in Wii Sports Resort. You may remember table

02:46:39.660 --> 02:46:45.580
tennis was in Wii Play, and golf was in the original Wii Sports. Awesome! They're recycling

02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:48.660
minigames now. Go Nintendo.

02:46:48.660 --> 02:46:49.660
Wow.

02:46:49.660 --> 02:46:56.740
Let's see, but now it's more precise, but yet they don't have, well, they have table

02:46:56.740 --> 02:47:01.900
tennis, I guess, but they don't have, well, whatever. Yes. This is interesting. Apparently

02:47:01.900 --> 02:47:08.300
a new game has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii. It is mature-rated. It's called Sexy

02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:13.980
Poker. Yes, Sexy Poker, which the content descriptors are nudity, sexual themes, and

02:47:13.980 --> 02:47:19.080
simulated gambling. Apparently the description of it is it's a strip poker game in which

02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:24.020
players engage in games of blackjack and poker against female avatar opponents. The object

02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:27.620
of the game is to win hands in order to remove articles of clothing from still images of

02:47:27.620 --> 02:47:33.360
female characters. Nurses, police, women, office workers, and sports figures can eventually

02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:39.040
be stripped down to show their bare breasts. Ooh, adult games on the Wii. Yeah, I remember

02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:42.780
strip poker games on the Commodore 64. They were epic. Yeah, but you'd think something

02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:49.060
like this. Pixelated boobies. They just wouldn't be, you know, coming out on the Wii, because

02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:55.620
the Wii's a family system, so it's kind of surprising. There's a, this is kind of interesting,

02:47:55.620 --> 02:48:02.500
Hull Breach Online, the first MMORPG for the Wii's internet channel, has now apparently

02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:09.860
been scaled down to run on the DSi browser. So yes, it's a free-to-play MMO, and apparently

02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:15.260
space-themed, and looks very basic, but I can imagine that you can't really do too much

02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:24.420
with the DSi browser. Kind of limited. And then a little bit more information about Tatsunoko

02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:31.560
vs. Capcom. The game's now being called Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars, and apparently

02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:36.360
online play may be added in. New characters might happen, and it's supposed to be due

02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:40.940
out before the end of the year. Actually, I was wondering though, because after some

02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:43.860
thought, the characters that you were saying were cut were never in the Japanese version

02:48:43.860 --> 02:48:53.300
to begin with. Yeah, well, I don't know. And then finally, it's just kind of interesting.

02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:59.940
Coming from CodeJunkies.com, they have a new accessory that's out now for the Xbox 360.

02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:07.080
They apparently have figured out how to reverse-engineer the memory cards. Now you can get a device

02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:15.300
for as cheap as $39.99, and it will use microSD cards, so you can store up to 16GB of data

02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:20.580
on there. And if you think about that, since it doesn't have all the backwards compatibility

02:49:20.580 --> 02:49:26.580
stuff, like the Xbox 360 hard drives, it's actually larger than the Xbox 360 20GB hard

02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:32.860
drives, now in memory card form, so you can get these really cheap. And microSD cards,

02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:37.660
those are pretty damn cheap nowadays, especially the 4GB and 16GB ones. I think I just got

02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:48.580
a, well it wasn't a microSD, but just a standard HD card for $50, so 16GB. So, I mean, that's

02:49:48.580 --> 02:49:53.580
amazing. And now that they come up with this, I'm sure that the hacking scene is going to

02:49:53.580 --> 02:49:57.020
take notice, and they're going to figure out a way to put any sort of hard drive on there.

02:49:57.020 --> 02:50:02.020
Goody goody. So, matter of time. And that's it.

02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:05.980
Alright, well that is going to do it for another week here at Orange Launch Radio. It's time

02:50:05.980 --> 02:50:11.580
to go around and wrap things up with our final thoughts. DarkSakura, whose home we've invaded

02:50:11.580 --> 02:50:14.980
now with Orange Launch Radio, and it looks like we will be for the near future. Your

02:50:14.980 --> 02:50:15.980
final thought tonight?

02:50:15.980 --> 02:50:17.700
Let's go see Star Trek Tuesday.

02:50:17.700 --> 02:50:22.660
Maybe. I don't know yet what I've got going on. But maybe. I do want to see it again.

02:50:22.660 --> 02:50:24.740
Lowkey, your final thought?

02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:29.060
This chair hurts my butt, and I'm going to play some Bion Commander this week.

02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:34.620
Awesome. I don't really have much of a final thought, except I'm excited to be going to

02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:40.060
LA in a couple weeks, and things are good. So that's it. Hopefully I get to play more

02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:43.460
games this week. That's my final thought. Thank you guys so much for downloading and

02:50:43.460 --> 02:50:46.980
supporting independent radio and independent podcasting. Remember, if you like our show,

02:50:46.980 --> 02:50:51.620
all we ask, tell two people you know about our show, whether you love them or hate them.

02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:55.140
Just spread the word about our show. Word of mouth is how a word gets out about our

02:50:55.140 --> 02:50:59.700
show and how we keep things going. And if you don't want to do that, at least leave

02:50:59.700 --> 02:51:04.500
us a review on iTunes or on one of those podcasting review sites or what have you. Help us spread

02:51:04.500 --> 02:51:07.940
the word about Orange Launch Radio. It's a word of mouth that really helps it.

02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:11.580
That's it. Have a great week, everybody, and we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge

02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:12.580
