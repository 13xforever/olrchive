7000	14000	There's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	20000	Tonight, May 24th, 2009, an OLR favorite game is getting remade on the DS and Wii.
20000	23000	Did Sony confirm the smaller PS3 with their lawsuits?
23000	27000	Will I soon be able to rent games on my PSP?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	46000	And joining you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host.
46000	49000	Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	50000	Porn!
50000	51000	How are you doing?
51000	52000	Porn.
52000	53000	Nah, I just wanted to say porn.
53000	54000	Is he internet for porn?
54000	56000	I wanted the first word that I said on the show tonight to be porn.
56000	58000	Alright, well there you go, it was.
58000	60000	Second word of the show, official word of the show.
60000	61000	Yes.
61000	62000	Tribble.
62000	64000	Alright, so are you into Tribble porn or something?
64000	66000	No, I want to see Star Trek again.
66000	67000	Oh dear.
67000	68000	For the third time in the theater.
68000	72000	And then we went back to Becky's house and watched Tribble with Tribbles and then Trial and Tribulations.
72000	74000	Did you see the new, the HD?
74000	77000	Because apparently they remade a bunch of Star Trek episodes in HD.
77000	78000	I have to tell you.
78000	84000	Everyone who goes to see the movie or goes to see it again, when they first show Scotty, look on his desk, there's a Tribble.
84000	86000	Nice. OMG spoilers.
86000	87000	I'm just kidding.
87000	92000	Okay, like the Tribble, oh and the way they defeat the guy is Tribbles.
92000	97000	So since you brought up porn, what would you say is your favorite porn?
97000	102000	The boneheads.
102000	109000	I have actually not seen much in the way of porn, but the boneheads.
109000	113000	My favorite porns are the ones that are based off of like, you know, movies and stuff too.
113000	114000	Ally McKeel was pretty funny.
114000	115000	Ally McKeel is one of my favorites.
115000	119000	But the boneheads is a parody of Coneheads where they had collapsible head attachments.
119000	121000	That was actually the first one I saw.
121000	122000	Nice.
122000	125000	And my favorite animated, Bible Black.
125000	126000	Sorry.
126000	128000	Bible Black is kind of cool.
128000	129000	It's all good.
129000	130000	Hey, look in the chat.
130000	140000	Chat.orangelandtrader.com is always there when, you know, every night, every week that we tape this show, you guys are always there to entertain us with your chat comments.
140000	145000	And we have Tigerclaw says, Sky, the classic Star Trek series in HD is now available in Blu-ray.
145000	147000	And yeah, I've heard about that.
147000	149000	Plus all the old movies are available in Blu-ray too.
149000	152000	But wake me when they have the next generation movies in Blu-ray.
152000	154000	I love the Mesa Summa.
154000	155000	Tribble porn.
155000	156000	Aren't Tribbles born pregnant?
156000	161000	By the way, if you pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.
161000	162000	Nice.
162000	168000	One Night Stands in Chat says, I just saw a porno called Six Fags, Magic Mount Him.
168000	169000	I want to see that.
169000	170000	Yeah, that sounds funny.
170000	171000	See, those are my favorite ones.
171000	172000	The ones that are based off of actual movies.
172000	174000	And no, Final Fuck X was crap.
174000	175000	Good cosplay.
175000	176000	Really crappy porn.
176000	178000	We talk about games sometimes on this show.
178000	180000	But you're probably wondering, where's Loki?
180000	181000	You haven't heard him yet.
181000	182000	Yeah, I mean, I know.
182000	185000	We gagged him with duct tape and taped him in the closet of his house.
185000	187000	Porn gets brought up and where's Loki to comment.
187000	189000	But sadly, he's not here tonight.
189000	190000	But it's for a good reason.
190000	191000	You may or may not have heard.
191000	193000	Loki is now a homeowner.
193000	194000	He got the keys to a house this week.
194000	197000	So him and Mrs. Loki have moved into the house.
197000	200000	But they have, you know, when you first move into a house, I don't know how many of you
200000	204000	know this, but there's like a million things you have to take care of when you're a homeowner,
204000	207000	especially if you're buying a fixer-upper, which I believe they did.
207000	209000	So they're fixing up some things right now.
209000	210000	But he will be back next week.
210000	211000	It's just temporary.
211000	212000	He's out tonight.
212000	216000	We are going to talk about the latest and greatest in video gaming, starting off with
216000	217000	our gaming weeks.
217000	220000	I do want to tell everybody, though, up front, because of the holiday, because of the fact
220000	223000	we have no Loki and because of the fact it's kind of a short news week, we do have a short
223000	224000	show tonight.
224000	226000	We're only going to be going for about an hour and a half tonight as opposed to our
226000	227000	usual three hours.
227000	231000	So apologies to those of you that were hoping for the long show tonight.
231000	233000	But it's kind of a holiday.
233000	234000	So we're going to take it easy tonight.
234000	235000	But we still have your calls.
235000	236000	It's not a drunk show, though.
236000	237000	It's a beer show.
237000	238000	That's right.
238000	239000	Dark Soccer is drinking beer.
239000	241000	I, however, due to everything I went through last year, I'm not drinking.
241000	242000	I have vodka.
242000	243000	I have Odwalla.
243000	244000	I have low fat.
244000	245000	I can't.
245000	246000	Just alcohol in general is a bad idea.
246000	247000	I have some rubbing alcohol.
247000	248000	I have wine once in a while.
248000	249000	I have witch hazel.
249000	250000	I have wine once in a while.
250000	251000	I have wine.
251000	252000	I don't want wine.
252000	253000	I have witch hazel.
253000	254000	I've got to be sober tonight.
254000	256000	I've got to be sober for the kids since you're setting a bad one.
256000	257000	I have peroxide.
257000	258000	All right.
258000	259000	Look.
259000	260000	Shut up.
260000	261000	Shut up and tell us about your gaming week.
261000	262000	I played Sims.
262000	263000	That's about it.
263000	264000	That's it?
264000	265000	Really?
265000	266000	Yeah.
266000	267000	Really.
267000	268000	Because, dude, I've been so...
268000	269000	Oh, you had finals this week, huh?
269000	273560	I had my last final on Monday, and after that, I was like, brain.
273560	276000	But no video games to kind of fill in that void?
276000	277000	That's usually what I do.
277000	278000	Why the hell do you think Sims is?
278000	279000	It's a video game.
279000	280000	It uses my video card.
280000	281000	That's true.
281000	282000	That is one you'll get sucked into.
282000	283960	Well, what kinds of things have you been enjoying in Sims?
283960	285920	Are you prepping for the release of Sims 3?
285920	286920	Kind of.
286920	288600	But I've been enjoying porn in Sims.
288600	292160	I've actually found a bunch of naughty items that I just was curious to see how they worked,
292160	294240	so I downloaded them just to see.
294240	296300	They're really horrible.
296300	299760	Why do you think people go instantly to doing dirty porno things?
299760	300760	Is it just because they can?
300760	301760	The first things that you learn...
301760	302760	Okay.
302760	305980	It goes back to the first things that you learn in any language is how to cuss and how
305980	308600	to talk about sex.
308600	313000	So the first thing that you do in any game, find all the dirty crap, especially if you
313000	314000	didn't mod it.
314000	316480	How else do you think they found hot coffee, please?
316480	319600	How else do you think hot coffee got in the damn game?
319600	322640	They were gonna have some nookie in that game, hell yeah.
322640	325840	So but no, really what I've been doing, and actually my two favorite things to do is to
325840	334240	play with the Sims body shop thing where you can, you know, if you download different skins
334240	337180	and everything, you can make your own Sims look pretty cool.
337180	341680	Like I showed Rob one that I made of a couple of characters I used to have, and I've even
341680	346720	done one for, you know, quite a number of my old tabletop game characters are pretty
346720	348720	cool.
348720	349720	I did one of me.
349720	352000	I'm gonna do one of Rob just because it's funny.
352000	353560	I want to see what that looks like when he finished.
353560	354560	The Rob Sim.
354560	357560	I might not do it in the show, but I don't know.
357560	358560	No later.
358560	359560	You still need to meet later.
359560	364880	But the other thing I like doing is building houses, and I've actually built some pretty
364880	365880	freaking...
365880	366880	My first house was shit.
366880	367880	Okay.
367880	368880	I just...
368880	369880	The first house was crap.
369880	372480	The first house I built, though, is pretty damn cool, and I love it, and I would actually
372480	374660	live in that house if I could.
374660	382240	So I've been, you know, sort of letting out an artistic thing, you know, something that's
382240	385080	been lagging, you know, while I've been in school.
385080	386080	My art...
386080	390800	I guess my artsy stuff has been focused toward my assignments, towards this theme, that theme,
390800	394340	getting this done, getting that done, and I've really just sort of enjoyed having kind
394340	398840	of a point and click kind of artistry lately, you know, where I don't have to really use
398840	401600	my brain so much, I can just pick things as I want to.
401600	403080	It's been pretty cool.
403080	405920	You might need to play some Ragnarok this week, because I'm thinking about signing up,
405920	406920	because...
406920	407920	Really?
407920	408920	I haven't played Ragnarok in about a month now.
408920	409920	Wait a minute.
409920	410920	Wait a minute.
410920	412640	This is the same girl who every week is like, oh, you should sign up on my server.
412640	414320	You should sign up and play some Ragnarok.
414320	415320	And now that I'm finally...
415320	416320	If you sign up and play with me, I'll play.
416320	417320	All right.
417320	420660	Because I might do that, because, you know, transitioning into my gaming week, I was playing
420660	426280	a little bit of World of Warcraft this week, of course, as usual, but there's theatrics
426280	427280	going on.
427280	428280	We'll leave it at that.
428280	430240	But there's theatrics, and it's just kind of making me go, whatever.
430240	432280	I mean, I play games for fun.
432280	434880	I don't know why everybody else can't do the same thing.
434880	439320	But yeah, so I'm thinking about, you know, just chilling out in another game for a little
439320	440320	while while I can.
440320	444160	Because life's going to get very busy with, you know, in a couple weeks being E3 and everything
444160	445160	going on.
445160	449180	So, you know, now's a good time to sell me on other MMOs if you want to get me to check
449180	450180	it out.
450180	452320	Even part of me was like, I should go back and check out Final Fantasy XI, but then I
452320	455320	was like, no, that's really a bad idea.
455320	456320	That's a bad idea, Rob.
456320	458200	That's a disaster waiting to happen.
458200	459200	It is.
459200	461480	And I'm thinking of starting on Perfect Life, now that I finally got it downloaded.
461480	464840	But, you know, Star Trek Online's going to be coming out before too long.
464840	465840	Yeah?
465840	466840	And, oh my god.
466840	467840	I can't wait for that.
467840	468840	So freaking playing it.
468840	469840	Hells yeah.
469840	470840	I'm so there when that comes out.
470840	471840	Other games in my gaming week.
471840	472840	You know, I haven't actually played an awful lot.
472840	475320	I know, it's kind of like, it's affecting both Jamie and I.
475320	480000	But I did fire up the 360 earlier this week and was still playing some Space Invaders Extreme.
480000	484240	And I finally bought Outrun, because I checked out the demo like a while back, but I finally
484240	485560	actually had some time to sit down.
485560	490840	I was like, I want a fun arcade racer, and hello Outrun on the Xbox Live Arcade.
490840	492920	And you know, fun little game.
492920	496880	I like racing games that are not complex, like Outrun.
496880	500600	You know, I can't get into the Forza, because I don't know enough about cars, and I don't
500600	501760	like to customize my cars.
501760	503720	I just like to step on the gas and go.
503720	506600	And Outrun is a fun, you know, it always has been a great little arcade game.
506600	508480	And I like the one on Xbox 360.
508480	509480	It's fun.
509480	510480	I need to play more of the multiplayer, though.
510480	514460	I only really checked out single player this week, and was trying to beat it, and would
514460	519680	come so close, and can't seem to beat it, because I suck at video games.
519680	520680	No, I don't know.
520680	522920	I just, I didn't, I guess, spend enough time with it.
522920	523920	I don't know.
523920	524920	But yeah.
524920	528600	Otherwise, now I've been watching some movies, and you know, just catching up on some other
528600	531840	stuff around the house, and other things going on in my personal life.
531840	534200	Tomorrow's gonna be a big video gaming day, though.
534200	538840	I don't have a lot of other stuff planned, so my things to do are clean and play video
538840	541080	games, and to get in a bunch of things before E3.
541080	547400	So I had a Twitter message asking me to check out Team Fortress 2, which I'm gonna try to
547400	549400	do tomorrow.
549400	553800	Also I really need to get in and play more Left 4 Dead, so I might make it a PC day tomorrow,
553800	557320	but I also want to go back and visit some of my Xbox 360 RPGs, like, I don't know why.
557320	562200	I have this real itch to go back and do Lost Odyssey, because I only really got through,
562200	566520	like, maybe the first third, or the first half, and I really want to go and finish that.
566520	567800	So we'll see.
567800	572720	So, um, yeah, that's my plans for this upcoming week.
572720	573720	How about you guys?
573720	575040	Did you guys have a good gaming week?
575040	576040	I'm looking at chat room.
576040	581120	Uh, Cheeseburger says, I saw Star Trek twice already, and I'm gonna see it again.
581120	586640	Uh, Unfolded Raptor says, I've been playing Bionic Commando all day, and I'm already 63%
586640	587640	done.
587640	589040	I'm kinda curious how fun that is.
589040	592680	I've been hearing some mixed things on it, so I'm kinda curious what our chatters think
592680	593680	of that.
593680	595280	Certainly I like the old school one.
595280	597280	And I like the redone old school one.
597280	600640	That was a real fun one on Xbox Live Arcade.
600640	605120	Um, uh, let's see, also GameGuru asks, when is E3?
605120	610200	E3 is not this upcoming week, like tomorrow, but it's a week after, like it starts a week
610200	611200	from Tuesday.
611200	614640	June 2nd is when it starts, and I'll be going down there Monday night.
614640	618640	So we're still gonna have shows, actually, through E3 week.
618640	622740	Because Dark Sakura is not going, I do not believe we're going to be doing anything live
622740	628200	from E3, but stay tuned to the Twitter and to the website, you never know what surprise
628200	629200	we might have cooked up.
629200	633520	I am gonna take my video camera, but, um, as I was telling Bobby earlier, Bobby Blackwolf
633520	637700	who's before us here on Sunday nights on All Games Radio, I don't think there's a lot we
637700	640440	can do that all the big websites aren't already gonna do.
640440	645240	You know, we're not gonna be the first to report on the news, we rarely are, you know,
645240	649120	we're not gonna really be, you know, on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest E3
649120	650120	news.
650120	654280	All we can do is say, hey, you guys have been reading what's going on at E3, what do you
654280	656120	want us to dig and find?
656120	659680	We're your reporters on the show, we're the show where every gamer has a voice, what do
659680	661060	you want us to find?
661060	664840	So we'll be definitely using Twitter and the website and some of the things to find out
664840	670040	what you guys want us to dig up at E3, so look for that and our reports, be it in video
670040	672460	form or other tweets or what have you.
672460	674680	So we'll be looking at that.
674680	677080	I guess that's pretty much all I have to say for housekeeping tonight, too, there's not
677080	681800	a lot of housekeeping items or things to talk about what's going on, but if you aren't following
681800	685980	us on Twitter, check it out at OLR, please be kind and leave us a nice five-star review
685980	689520	on iTunes as well if you enjoy what you hear because we do the show for free.
689520	693700	Unfortunately, I saw a nice one-star one on there the other day and that's always a bummer,
693700	697560	it's like, dude, and I'm sure the person listens to this show because it seemed like the kind
697560	700560	of thing where it's just to get a rise out of us, it's like, dude, we do this stuff for
700560	705280	free and it's like reading stuff like that is really disheartening, you know, leave five-star
705280	709280	reviews for the show you like, but what good is it to leave a one-star review for these
709280	711760	other shows and people that work hard, you know?
711760	713200	Unless they're really crap.
713200	716320	You know, I would like to think we're not really crap.
716320	720160	You know what, Rob, I honestly, I don't care.
720160	725440	I don't, but it sucks because that, and I blame Apple, it affects your ranking on the
725440	730040	whole, if you go in and look at the lineups of the shows in there, we were on page one
730040	733720	and now we dropped page three, and that's kind of disappointing, you know, that's the
733720	738080	only thing that bugs me about it, otherwise I don't care, but I must say, if you have
738080	741640	feedback or something you think we should be doing better on the show, send us an email,
741640	747640	mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, you know, do that, I'm kidding, all right, anyhow, that
747640	750720	being said, I don't want to get it too far into that, I paid that way too much attention
750720	756200	than it deserved, how about some gaming news, shall we, all right, hey, kind of a follow-up
756200	760040	to something we were talking about last week, 3D Realms, and we were talking about how 3D
760040	764920	Realms went under quote-unquote and took Duke Nukem Forever with it, well, this is interesting
764920	770000	because apparently 3D Realms actually released a public statement this week, you know, after
770000	774360	the whole development team was dissolved that was working on Duke Nukem Forever, and they
774360	779780	said they are not closed and they are not closing, however, they are saying that Take
779780	785140	Two will be retaining the publishing rights to Duke Nukem Forever and they will be able
785140	789320	to sell the game directly to the public, but what's interesting, now they're coming around,
789320	792700	they're kind of doing this little mudslinging there with Take Two, they're saying that Take
792700	798720	Two has actually bullied 3D Realms over the past year on their negotiation, what's going
798720	805240	on, and that 3D Realms is saying that Take Two tried to force a sale out of the situation
805240	809680	and 3D Realms left the table essentially, but you know, I can't help, I don't know,
809680	813320	I feel like there's two sides to every story and I still can't help but think, guys, what
813320	815780	were you producing on this game?
815780	820500	There was not a lot of public buzz going on because they refused to release screenshots,
820500	825020	there was no demo, they hadn't shown at E3 for years, what did they expect was going
825020	826020	to happen?
826020	829800	I mean, as much as I was excited for Duke Nukem Forever like the last guy, tease us
829800	833980	a little bit with something, you know, and I understand Take Two probably had the open
833980	838680	book and they got to see everything that was going on, but still, I mean, it's a business
838680	842360	and if people aren't, it's tough to sell a game in this day and age with, you know, look
842360	846320	at Prey and how kind of disappointing that ended up being sales-wise, you know, if there's
846320	851840	not the buzz out there for the game, it's not going to be pretty, and I bet you anything
851840	855080	now that Take Two does have the rights to this, we're going to see this game out in
855080	859680	a year or two, tops, two years tops, this game comes out.
859680	866840	Well, we can, if it ever really does, I mean, honestly, I sort of lost my expectation of
866840	868160	it really coming out.
868160	871520	I guess that's true, and you know, I don't even think at this point it might be a subpar
871520	874960	game, but I don't know, I'm not going to write it off completely, never write off a game
874960	877320	until you play it, that's what I'm planning to do.
877320	881200	Well, here's a game that some people might get to play if they have a Dreamcast, it's
881200	888040	coming up for Windows, Linux, and Dreamcast, yep, it's a homebrew game called Hypertension
888040	901560	and it is a re-imaging of Blood, which is a Doom-based, uses the Doom-based engine.
901560	908360	So yeah, it's kind of old school in that sense, but it's coming out on Dreamcast, so hey,
908360	911280	why not if you got it, buy it, I guess.
911280	921200	I'm looking a little bit at the play from it, and I'm really not impressed, I mean,
921200	926600	then again, it's old school, it's Doom-like, is that not, well, I don't know, it's got
926600	931080	some 3D, I guess, but it's not pixely, meh.
931080	932960	It looks a little like, yeah, Doomish.
932960	933960	It's quaky.
933960	938000	Doomish meets, yeah, kind of in that vein, the early 90s, or I guess maybe the mid-90s.
938000	943080	But the weapon is aerosol and a lighter, I love it.
943080	946480	But I mean, is there really a market for these types of Dreamcast games, it's kind of funny,
946480	951320	I don't know, does everybody report on these games because it's like, OMG, new Dreamcast
951320	952320	game, who would've thought?
952320	960180	It's a homebrew, I think it's notable, you know, there's being homebrewed, you know,
960180	961180	that's about it.
961180	965600	And people still love the Dreamcast, I guess, I do.
965600	969480	I guess, and one thing I did love about the Dreamcast is that there was so much homebrew
969480	972920	available for it, you know what I play most of all on my Dreamcast?
972920	973920	NES emulator.
973920	977840	I mean, honestly, that's one of the greatest things about it, although, I bested out Marvel
977840	981720	vs Capcom 2 the other night, yeah, yeah, good times.
981720	986520	So you did do some gaming this week, of Dan did, a little bit, we is in my household.
986520	987520	Gotcha.
987520	992440	Well, hey, another first person shooter that's pretty popular, Metroid Prime, you know why,
992440	996840	because it's one of the few AAA first person shooters that they have on the Nintendo Wii,
996840	999640	although granted, there's some others in the works or what have you, but, you know, Metroid
999640	1001320	Prime, you'd definitely say is established.
1001320	1006160	The Metroid series is a hugely established franchise.
1006160	1010520	Of course, Metroid Prime 3 was the only one that's been released on the Wii in this country,
1010520	1015120	however, Metroid Prime 1 and 2 were re-released over in Japan, kind of the whole new Wii controls.
1015120	1016120	Well, guess what?
1016120	1021400	Nintendo announced this week that the Metroid Prime trilogy will be coming to the US, and
1021400	1025160	that means that Metroid Prime will be kind of repackaged, the first two games will have
1025160	1029420	the new Wii controls and the whole wide screen graphics, which, you know, I bet a lot of
1029420	1033380	people have mixed feelings about, but if you never really bought one or two, you know,
1033380	1035640	this might be a good way to revisit those games.
1035640	1039680	The only bummer is, no news here about Metroid Prime 4.
1039680	1044720	You know, if you have a Metroid Prime trilogy, and it kind of insinuates there may not be
1044720	1048900	a Metroid Prime 4, but I do have that hope that maybe that's one of the surprises they're
1048900	1052320	going to pull out at E3, but, I don't know, I wouldn't bet on it.
1052320	1056560	Of course, at the same time, I would like to see a new 2D Metroid, so maybe this is
1056560	1061440	the end of Metroid Prime, but maybe there will be a new Metroid series, like, you know,
1061440	1066360	there was Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero, you know, maybe a new Metroid series.
1066360	1068720	This is the end of Prime, the beginning of something new, I hope.
1068720	1070560	I want old school Metroid.
1070560	1075960	I do too, and I think a lot of people want that, but, I don't know, is it really something
1075960	1081240	that might sell, or something we're not, or something we would get not on the DS?
1081240	1082240	You know what I mean?
1082240	1084120	Even more though, will it blend?
1084120	1087840	I think if a new 2D Metroid's going to come out, it's just going to be on the DS, and
1087840	1091360	that's kind of the bummer about it, is that, you know, yeah, I like the DS and all, but
1091360	1096640	I like to play the old school games on my TV as well, the big surround sound, you know,
1096640	1101520	look at some of the games that are 2D, 3D hybrids that were on consoles that were pretty
1101520	1102520	good.
1102520	1104840	Well, Street Fighter IV is a perfect example, right?
1104840	1107680	2D Fighter, awesome use of 3D in it.
1107680	1108680	Yeah.
1108680	1110920	Why couldn't you make a platformer in that kind of vein?
1110920	1111920	Or a game going back a little bit?
1111920	1115680	Well, that's what we really got for platformers, and I think LittleBigPlanet.
1115680	1116680	That's a great example.
1116680	1120560	I was going to say Beautiful Joe, even though that's back on the GameCube, but still, you
1120560	1122520	know, a good example of, you know, 2D platformers.
1122520	1123680	And Shinagogo.
1123680	1125160	They can still be a lot of fun.
1125160	1126160	Yeah.
1126160	1131040	Well, if anything, I think that LittleBigPlanet proved that, like, right away.
1131040	1136680	Reenie says in chat, Metroid Prime 4, you lost your power-ups again, moron.
1136680	1137680	I guess that's true.
1137680	1139960	How many times can we go through the same story of, whoops, lost my power-ups.
1139960	1141920	Maybe we can use dumb blonde as an excuse.
1141920	1142920	I don't know.
1142920	1143920	Yeah, just make it a prequel.
1143920	1144920	Make it another prequel.
1144920	1148680	Tigerclaw says the next one will be called Metroid Prime 4, Electric Boogaloo.
1148680	1149680	One can hope.
1149680	1152400	That would only be if, that was what they should have called Metroid Prime 2.
1152400	1156400	Brad from Pod Culture says Metroid Prime 4, Mission to Moscow.
1156400	1157400	Who knows?
1157400	1162240	If you want to join us and chat live on this Sunday evening, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1162240	1166720	Well, this is something that I am going to have to get.
1166720	1174900	This is on my must-buy-we list, is they're doing a haunted house simulator.
1174900	1179480	And it is going to be Ju-On, which is The Grudge.
1179480	1184560	Yes, as in the same movie, and probably not including Sarah Michelle Gellar.
1184560	1187040	It already came out in Japan a few weeks ago.
1187040	1190680	It will be localized, hopefully pre-Halloween.
1190680	1195560	So hopefully we'll be able to see it, but it's actually, um, as being consulted on it
1195560	1202960	is, um, is Shimizu Takashi, who was the guy who directed, actually, not only the Japanese
1202960	1205960	version, but he directed the first American one.
1205960	1207720	The second one is utter shit.
1207720	1209280	Don't go see it.
1209280	1215880	Um, but it's basically the, the, you're using the Wiimote as a flashlight on screen and
1215880	1222280	you go through a warehouse, a mannequin factory, um, a hospital, you know, just basically all
1222280	1226640	your usual, oh my god, I'm scared places, you know.
1226640	1234640	Um, but it's supposed to have a twist where you can use your second Wiimote to make in-game
1234640	1237240	things happen immediately.
1237240	1243640	In fact, the actual quote from this article, and I have to read this, Rob, is to make in-game
1243640	1248080	events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.
1248080	1251520	I like that, and I, there's a YouTube they're promoting this with that just shows a bunch
1251520	1252520	of scared people.
1252520	1255200	Hey, I'm all for scary games that are gonna make me jump out of my seat.
1255200	1258040	I don't know though, The Grudge, you know, I'm on it.
1258040	1262240	The first movie was cool, but I've seen the second one, the Japanese movie, I've seen
1262240	1266960	the, um, the TV movie, uh, Jeff and I were renting movies the other night and they, I
1266960	1271560	saw The Grudge 3 on DVD and I looked at that and I was like, lol, there's a third one.
1271560	1272560	Was it American?
1272560	1274120	Yeah, it was American Grudge 3.
1274120	1275120	No.
1275120	1276120	Yes.
1276120	1277120	No.
1277120	1278120	Yes.
1278120	1282760	Unless it said The Grudge 3, I don't know if it was maybe the Japanese one being marketed
1282760	1284920	as an American one, I don't know, but it was there.
1284920	1285920	No.
1285920	1286920	I crap you not.
1286920	1292660	Well, I'll have to, the second one's funny cause it's about what's her face doing dirty
1292660	1295400	things with the main character, it's pretty funny.
1295400	1298640	Not dirty that way, she's, it's very interesting.
1298640	1299640	It's very interesting.
1299640	1302480	Yeah, 2009 direct to video.
1302480	1303480	It came out.
1303480	1304480	That is shit.
1304480	1308400	Stars, uh, Shawnee Smith from the, uh, Saw series is in it.
1308400	1309400	Oh, whatever.
1309400	1310840	There it is.
1310840	1311840	The Grudge 3.
1311840	1312840	I don't know when this came out.
1312840	1314200	It came out 12th, 12th of May.
1314200	1315200	So it just came out.
1315200	1316720	It doesn't exist in my universe.
1316720	1319040	Do you want to hear the plot?
1319040	1320040	No.
1320040	1324400	A young Japanese woman who holds the key to stopping the evil spirit of Kayako travels
1324400	1328040	to the haunted Chicago apartment from the sequel, dot, dot, dot.
1328040	1330560	I'm not going to read the rest cause you didn't really want to hear it anyway.
1330560	1331560	Meh.
1331560	1333800	Cause you recognized it from any of the Japanese ones.
1333800	1338800	No, it goes still moved to Chicago from Japan to Chicago.
1338800	1343800	No, all they have to do is just hop on an airplane.
1343800	1352320	No, the whole, that's someone who completely just knows crap about, you know, hauntings
1352320	1353320	and anything.
1353320	1356320	They usually stay localized.
1356320	1359520	Tiger Claw in chat says they tend to milk those movies by creating crappy direct to
1359520	1360520	DVD sequels.
1360520	1361520	Yep.
1361520	1362520	That's true.
1362520	1365080	Um, you know, there's a sequel to Donnie Darko that just came out too.
1365080	1366080	That was direct to video.
1366080	1367080	I haven't watched that yet.
1367080	1372440	I want to see it's been actually in writing and production for quite a while now and I
1372440	1373440	really want to see it.
1373440	1376880	Well, Jeff rented that and I was, you know, he wanted to watch it, but I was kinda like,
1376880	1378480	I don't remember the first one well enough.
1378480	1381960	I haven't seen the first one in like 10 years cause seriously, they're making a sequel to
1381960	1383840	a movie that's like 10 years old.
1383840	1386200	So I need to just go watch the first one.
1386200	1387200	Here's my copy right here.
1387200	1388200	Really?
1388200	1389200	Add the director's edition.
1389200	1390200	Yeah.
1390200	1391200	Right.
1391200	1392640	Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie.
1392640	1398320	And plus, you know, any movie that Drew Barrymore is going to produce and I love Drew Barrymore.
1398320	1401000	She would be like my secret girlfriend if I could.
1401000	1402000	Yeah.
1402000	1403000	So yeah.
1403000	1410340	Um, you know, I, uh, I don't know, I, I I'll go watch if it's really that good, like Jeff
1410340	1413600	can watch it for me and if it's really that good, I'll, he'll watch it again and I can
1413600	1414600	see it.
1414600	1415600	Right.
1415600	1416600	Yep.
1416600	1417600	All right.
1417600	1418600	Uh, let's see.
1418600	1424720	What if the ghost wanted some deep dish pizza, but I'm bummed.
1424720	1431560	I feel like slipping my wrist now I'm bleeding my pain on your face.
1431560	1433780	That was so Gothic and tragic.
1433780	1434780	Thank you.
1434780	1439620	Hey, um, something Nintendo might come after you and slit your wrist and make you a bleed
1439620	1444440	your pain on their face because Nintendo is pissed about these DS flashcards.
1444440	1446480	Uh, Loki was talking about it a little bit this week.
1446480	1451840	Well guess what eBay and Amazon both now have had to stop selling these DS flashcards.
1451840	1455480	Um, Nintendo is basically, I don't know what they did, but they basically convinced a eBay
1455480	1457280	and Amazon to stop selling them.
1457280	1460960	Quote Nintendo is pleased with the cooperation is received from both eBay and Amazon to prevent
1460960	1463120	the sales of game copying devices.
1463120	1467560	And that was from Nintendo's global head of anti piracy, Jody dot tree.
1467560	1475240	In an interview with MCV, um, eBay is actually pulling the auctions on this and Amazon got
1475240	1478600	a notice and take down and all this fun stuff.
1478600	1482520	So a good luck though, getting all those mom pause stores that still, still sell this,
1482520	1487360	but still puts a little dent in it and makes it a little bit harder to get.
1487360	1492560	If you are looking for these cartridges, um, Rini though, and chat says, flashcards are
1492560	1493560	a waste of money.
1493560	1494560	Hi there.
1494560	1496240	SD card slot on DSI.
1496240	1499200	Gold anthro admits the Amazon is where he got his are for.
1499200	1500200	I don't know.
1500200	1501280	I'm not into the hacking thing.
1501280	1502280	Like a lot of y'all are.
1502280	1504820	I don't, I don't really have the patience for that stuff.
1504820	1506240	So I don't really do it.
1506240	1509880	Um, but I know this is probably a loss to those that were looking forward to the home
1509880	1510880	brew.
1510880	1515180	If you are using it for piracy though, well then, you know, it's hard to feel a little
1515180	1519160	pity for you, but at least the home brew and all that, as far as all that goes, that is
1519160	1520160	kind of a bummer.
1520160	1524400	So, all right, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
1524400	1531000	Well, in other news, we have, uh, some Sega stuff that makes me particularly happy.
1531000	1538080	Um, going to be coming out, um, for DS and Wii is Jambo Safari, actually.
1538080	1545240	Um, they are taking the old arcade title and, you know, making it pretty and more modern
1545240	1549800	looking and having more stuff happen, you know, to make people happy.
1549800	1554400	Um, there'll be customizable characters and vehicles and you can run a safari park and
1554400	1557120	help animals in need.
1557120	1561920	Uh, the DS version, of course, will work with the stylus and the Wii version will have a
1561920	1568760	lasso gameplay that uses the Wiimote and it's a, you can have a two player and four player
1568760	1572400	party version, so there will be more.
1572400	1576440	This is just proof that OLR has friends in high places somewhere, even though they're
1576440	1580560	not admitting who they are, seriously, who would have thought that Jambo fucking Safari
1580560	1581720	will get a remake.
1581720	1585200	This is the best news of the year so far, really.
1585200	1586800	I am so all about this game.
1586800	1591200	I just really hope it doesn't suck, but I don't know, Sega's got a pretty good track
1591200	1592600	record with the remakes.
1592600	1596960	I'm looking past Sonic because Sonics were like reinventions, but, uh, you know, Sega's
1596960	1600280	got a pretty good track record otherwise, so I'm really excited about Jambo Safari.
1600280	1603040	I don't know about you, DarkSakura, are you looking forward to this?
1603040	1605800	Yeah, pretty much, I like to play the game.
1605800	1609480	I still want my freaking Planet Harrier, do you hear me, Sega?
1609480	1610480	Whores.
1610480	1612980	I mean, I love you.
1612980	1616400	So I'm excited, I'm hoping that this announcement came out because this is one of the things
1616400	1618520	that's going to be playable at E3, do you think?
1618520	1619520	You think, you think, you think?
1619520	1620520	I hope.
1620520	1621520	I won't be there.
1621520	1622520	I know, but I will bring you-
1622520	1624120	I'm trying not to speculate on-
1624120	1628320	Maybe they'll have a Jambo keychain I can bring back for you, see?
1628320	1629320	There you go.
1629320	1630320	That'll be worthwhile.
1630320	1631320	Exactly, exactly.
1631320	1636320	Well, hey, we don't know much about Jambo Safari yet, hopefully a little more after
1636320	1639480	E3, but we do know about some of the games that are coming out this week.
1639480	1641800	Let's travel around the world and look at this week's release dates.
1641800	1645640	I'm going to start with the US, sadly Loki is not here to do US release dates, but I'll
1645640	1646960	fill in for him tonight.
1646960	1651920	On the Nintendo DS this week, Jake Hunter Detective Story, Memories of the Past, Johnny
1651920	1657520	Bravo, Datorama, a couple games with the preface of Crazy Chicken, including Star Carts, Pharaoh's
1657520	1662720	Treasure, Imagine Boutique Owner comes out this week as well, as well as Space Camp,
1662720	1665800	which I thought I remembered Loki reading a couple weeks ago, so I don't know if this
1665800	1667560	game was pushed back or what.
1667560	1671880	Sadly no, it is not based on the great 80s movie with the same name, so don't get your
1671880	1672880	hopes up.
1672880	1677240	On the personal trainer, Walking, also on the DS this week.
1677240	1678240	L.O.L.
1678240	1679240	What?
1679240	1681320	Learn How to Walk this week.
1681320	1682320	L.O.L.
1682320	1683320	What?
1683320	1688840	On the PC, Hinterland, Orc Lords, Age of Pirate 2, City of Abandoned Ships, Dragon
1688840	1694960	Sky, Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper, damnation is another game that comes out on the PC this
1694960	1695960	week.
1695960	1699880	Moving on to the consoles, one release on PS2 this week, it's Secret Agent Clank, and
1699880	1706360	on the Playstation 3 you also get Damnation, Infamous, Cross Edge, Trash Panic on the PSP
1706360	1712400	Crimson Gems Saga, and on the Wii, another version of Space Camp and the Munchables,
1712400	1717960	and on the Xbox 360, Damnation as well as Wallace and Gromit 2, Wallace and Gromit Episode
1717960	1722220	2, The Last Resort, which I believe is a Xbox Live game.
1722220	1725760	That is all that's coming out in the US this week, let's travel over to the UK, Dark Soccer.
1725760	1728560	For the UK on PS2 we have Secret Agent Clank.
1728560	1734800	On the 28th we have Inferno Pool and Saints Row 2 Corporate Warfare, and Trash Panic,
1734800	1745040	whatever that is, we have Artanelico, Two Melody of Metafalka, I guess, if I can, Falisa,
1745040	1746040	I guess?
1746040	1747040	I can't read it.
1747040	1748040	My brain doesn't work.
1748040	1751680	Is Trash Panic what my mother does when I leave a Coke can on the table because I forgot
1751680	1754480	to throw it away or what have you, or got lazy and just walked away?
1754480	1755480	That sounds like what it is.
1755480	1756480	Maybe.
1756480	1757480	Trash Panic.
1757480	1758480	Don't worry, mama will clean it.
1758480	1764200	On the 29th, Boom Blocks Bash Party, Brain Exercise with Dr. Kaleishima, and Fuel and
1764200	1773360	Virtua Tennis 2009, PDC World Championship Darts, and Valhalla Knights 2 on PSP.
1773360	1780160	Looking at the Japanese release dates on the Xbox 360 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou 5 Empires
1780160	1784920	comes out in both Japan and the general Asian regions.
1784920	1790960	This is Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires, basically, is what this is, your version of that.
1790960	1796560	Coming out in other places, I'm sorry, coming out on other consoles in the same place, Infamous
1796560	1800520	comes out in Asian regions, but it's not quite out in Japan this week.
1800520	1806360	However, Shin Sangoku Musou 5 comes out as well on the Playstation 3, and Agra Senki comes
1806360	1811600	out with a price reduction this week, down to $44.90.
1811600	1815960	Also a game called The Last Guy comes out from Sony computers themselves.
1815960	1820440	I am not sure, this is an action game, I'm not sure what this is a port of, but it looks
1820440	1823680	to be some type of shooter game, but what's kind of cool about it, it looks like it uses
1823680	1824680	Google Earth.
1824680	1828560	Like, seriously, doesn't the backgrounds here look like something you'd see in Google Earth?
1828560	1829560	Yeah, a bit.
1829560	1830560	That's kind of cool about it.
1830560	1831560	That's pretty cool.
1831560	1832560	Yeah.
1832560	1833560	So that comes out this week.
1833560	1837360	And looking on other consoles, going over to the Nintendo Wii, just one release this
1837360	1845360	week, Ogon no Kizuna comes out this week, which is not a game I've heard of.
1845360	1852260	It looks kind of similar to a Dynasty Warriors-ish type of game, but with a little more role-playing
1852260	1855620	elements mixed in, so check that out if you'd like.
1855620	1859640	On the Playstation 2, the Grand Theft Auto games get a price reduction this week, that's
1859640	1861180	something I look forward to in Japan.
1861180	1867180	On the Nintendo DS, Claymore, Gengan no Majo comes out this week, as well as Days of Memories
1867180	1874100	3 from SNK, Gaya Kukuten Kenji comes out as well, has a premium edition release as well
1874100	1877560	from Capcom, oh, you know what that is?
1877560	1880180	That's Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.
1880180	1884040	You know what, Rob, I do have to say that your Japanese is improving greatly.
1884040	1887600	At least this show's been good for something, huh?
1887600	1888600	Yeah.
1888600	1895880	Also, on the Nintendo DS, one more release for you from Sega, Suzumiya Haruhi no Shokurietsu.
1895880	1898200	It's a melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
1898200	1899200	That's what it is.
1899200	1901880	It's maids, is what this looks to be.
1901880	1908120	No, it's their school club, and Haruhi actually has a really good time dressing up the really
1908120	1912320	pretty girl up in bunny suits and different things to get stuff done for their club.
1912320	1915280	Well, there you go, bunny suit, to your heart's content this week.
1915280	1916280	They're school girls.
1916280	1918280	Because Haruhi is God.
1918280	1921040	No, actually, she is.
1921040	1922520	That's the premise of the story, she's God.
1922520	1928640	Quickly looking at the PSP release dates, Ghost in the Shell, oh, these are all movies.
1928640	1931840	I don't see any games this week.
1931840	1936920	Bamboo Blade is the only game it looks to be this week, so check that out if you'd like.
1936920	1938920	There you go, that's it for Japanese release dates.
1938920	1943580	Let's go back into some gaming news and talk about some music that's been licensed for
1943580	1945920	an upcoming Q Entertainment game.
1945920	1950960	Kind of interesting about this, apparently, Tiesto and BT songs have been licensed for
1950960	1953240	this new game from Q Entertainment.
1953240	1959400	The game is called QJ, based on some, I guess some folks have been digging around some of
1959400	1964760	the licensing information sites, the songs that were licensed.
1964760	1967440	Love Comes Again from Tiesto.
1967440	1969440	So there you go.
1969440	1974400	I don't know much about this, but if it's Q Entertainment, then it's Mizuguchi, and
1974400	1976120	I love him.
1976120	1980000	There's very few games he's put out that I haven't liked, and I'm even counting 99 Nights.
1980000	1985240	I forgave that game's shortcomings, just because I'm a whore for Tetsuya Mizuguchi games.
1985240	1987420	So there you go.
1987420	1989600	More about this game, hopefully at E3, hopefully.
1989600	1990600	Fingers crossed.
1990600	1995840	Well, what we have for the PlayStation Network is we do have some updates.
1995840	2001480	We have some demos of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10, Killzone 2, Bullet
2001480	2006720	4D Interactive AD, whatever, Red Faction, Guerrilla, Multiplayer, and Infamous, which
2006720	2007720	I sold a commercial for today.
2007720	2010600	I was like, dude, is this Comic Zone?
2010600	2016160	PS3 game content, Riddick Dark Athena Premium Multiplayer Pack.
2016160	2020960	We've got some more for Fear 2, Tom Clancy's Hawks, Pain, Modistore Pacific Rift, Little
2020960	2023360	Big Planet, a bunch of stuff for Little Big Planet.
2023360	2028000	Guitar Hero World Tour, the European track, Rock Band Alice Cooper Pack.
2028000	2029000	That's cool.
2029000	2034320	Rock Band Taking Back Sunday, and Kids Don't Follow by the Replacements.
2034320	2041960	For PSP games, we have Fading Shadows and Creatures Raised in Space.
2041960	2043720	Creatures Raised in Space?
2043720	2044720	Amazing.
2044720	2047280	I actually logged into Home this week.
2047280	2049440	That's one other game, quote unquote, I played.
2049440	2051640	Boy, that, Home is really expanding.
2051640	2057300	Say what you will about, you know, whether Home is a game or any fun, all with quotes,
2057300	2060760	but they're sure pouring a lot of expansions into it, which I guess is kind of cool.
2060760	2063720	It seems like you have a lot of new stuff to explore if you haven't used it in a while.
2063720	2065520	So props to them for that.
2065520	2069860	Like there's a new like area that you can go to where I guess they're going to do like
2069860	2072160	announcements inside Home.
2072160	2075440	Like there's a big giant screen in there, but it has like this weird jungle theme to
2075440	2076440	it.
2076440	2077440	I don't know.
2077440	2078440	I thought it was kind of interesting.
2078440	2079440	So we'll see.
2079440	2084040	Before I get to the next story, this chat comment made me lol.
2084040	2086420	Renee asks, Sky, here's a question.
2086420	2088480	Is Cooking Mama a MILF?
2088480	2091540	Please answer very important.
2091540	2093600	Is Cooking Mama a MILF?
2093600	2094600	Lord, no.
2094600	2095600	Yeah.
2095600	2096600	I unfortunately would have to say no.
2096600	2097600	She's too prudish.
2097600	2098600	That's why she's in the kitchen.
2098600	2100320	She's always in the kitchen and never in the bedroom.
2100320	2105240	Here you go, ba-dum-bum.
2105240	2111120	Moving on with some more news, talking about Sony and, well, it looks like Sony is going
2111120	2115360	to be threatening to sue companies that are publishing images of the PS3.
2115360	2117680	Remember we were talking about this last week?
2117680	2120360	We had some images leak out of the new PS3.
2120360	2124840	Well, apparently, Sony has been demanding that these companies stop doing this.
2124840	2128440	I know this all started from, I guess, their Taiwanese branch or something.
2128440	2133960	But dude, when you've threatened to sue, doesn't it kind of prove that the story is true?
2133960	2137680	That was my first thought, is like, well, way to give it away, right?
2137680	2142400	I mean, otherwise, wouldn't they just release that good old-fashioned line of, oh, Sony
2142400	2146080	will not comment on rumors and speculation at this time.
2146080	2148560	Look for our E3 speech.
2148560	2152800	But if you stick the lawyers on them, doesn't it kind of prove it to be true?
2152800	2154800	Maybe I'm crazy.
2154800	2161600	Well, how about some, I guess, happier news?
2161600	2170480	We are actually going to be getting some PlayStation 1 classic games for the PS1 Classic Store.
2170480	2174880	We have been getting information from the ESRB because you know how they love sleek
2174880	2180440	stuff and five games are supposed to be coming to the online service.
2180440	2186800	We have, among them, Resident Evil Director's Cut and Metal Gear Solid.
2186800	2193320	Also among those rated is Special Ops Covert Assault and Ranger Elite and Tom Clancy's
2193320	2194520	Rainbow Six.
2194520	2195960	So that's pretty cool.
2195960	2201760	But dude, Metal freaking Gear and Resident Evil Director's Cut, I will have to go along
2201760	2206120	with all the bad voice acting because I can quote that game, you know.
2206120	2207120	What is it?
2207120	2212080	I hope this is not Chris's blood.
2212080	2217480	Maybe the hidden porn chat will be kind of embedded in the game somewhere.
2217480	2218480	Who knows?
2218480	2219480	Because remember that?
2219480	2221480	There's YouTube out there where they mix and match all the dialogue into something disgusting.
2221480	2222480	You know what that was?
2222480	2224220	I'm going to tell you this because I know how you can do it.
2224220	2230680	There was a file reader that let you read the audio and video files off of PlayStation
2230680	2235200	games, because I don't know if you remember, back in the day, the first MP3s out for Bus
2235200	2236200	to Move 2.
2236200	2238480	Sorry, I did those.
2238480	2242600	You know, on my old website, I was the first person that I saw that I noticed that had
2242600	2247240	them online right after the game came out.
2247240	2254320	But there's a little reader program that you can get to pull, to rip the files off and
2254320	2259000	then just record them, you know, convert them to WAV or whatever and record them or whatever.
2259000	2260800	So that's actually how they pulled this off.
2260800	2264960	That's also how they got the thing about Maria in Castlevania, where an ending they didn't
2264960	2269840	put into the game of her actually being taken over by the succubus.
2269840	2275040	So you can find out it was a lot easier to find stuff on the old readers.
2275040	2277720	Apparently it sounds like that way.
2277720	2280760	So what does somebody just kind of dump all the dialogue and then edit it together?
2280760	2286860	I mean, that's pretty impressive, but you could also kind of like, you could dump the
2286860	2291000	audio like we used to do this, like to get some of the DDR songs off the home versions
2291000	2292000	of the game.
2292000	2293000	That was only when they were mixing audio.
2293000	2297280	Right, but no, I'm saying after that, we used to rip them by hooking them through the mixing
2297280	2298280	board.
2298280	2299280	I'm surprised people didn't do that.
2299280	2305920	Yeah, there was, you could still also pull them off doing the, was it, it wasn't RA,
2305920	2311360	it was like SX or SA reader or something?
2311360	2312360	I don't remember.
2312360	2313920	But yeah, I used to do that back in the day.
2313920	2317040	This was really easy to do those.
2317040	2318040	Hmm.
2318040	2323360	All right, well, apparently there's a lot of rumbling going on about what's going on
2323360	2329080	at E3 and possibly a new version of Metal Gear Solid apparently being rumored right
2329080	2330080	now.
2330080	2334000	And a lot of this has to do with the teaser graphic that showed up on the Kojima Productions
2334000	2337040	website.
2337040	2341920	Apparently what's going on is that something is being listed in next week's Famitsu that
2341920	2347160	the PSP and the PS3 apparently is indicating a new Metal Gear is going to be coming out.
2347160	2352240	Now, is that Metal Gear Solid 5 or some other type of Metal Gear game in the same vein?
2352240	2353240	Who knows?
2353240	2356840	But some rumors about the teaser graphic is that the outline was actually showing a 5.
2356840	2358200	I'm actually kind of surprised.
2358200	2359360	I saw that too.
2359360	2363400	Yeah, I'm surprised if this is Metal Gear Solid 5 because it seems kind of soon.
2363400	2367320	Is it just me or does it seem like 4 hasn't really been out long enough?
2367320	2369680	Am I crazy?
2369680	2371880	I don't know.
2371880	2377240	But you know, between the magazine, Famitsu magazine, E3 coming up next week with this
2377240	2381480	countdown seems to be pointing to, and all this, I mean, if there's a time to make a
2381480	2384960	big announcement, I suppose this will be it.
2384960	2390440	But you know, I don't know, it just seems too soon for Metal Gear Solid 5.
2390440	2393240	Another type of Metal Gear Solid game?
2393240	2397440	Like a new online one or, you know, I don't know, even heck, a new acid game is just coming
2397440	2399840	to PSP as well?
2399840	2401840	I don't know.
2401840	2403560	Is there anything you're hoping it is, Dark Sakura?
2403560	2404560	I don't know.
2404560	2407800	Do you think, is it just me or does it seem too soon for 5?
2407800	2408800	I don't know.
2408800	2409800	I don't know.
2409800	2414400	Because you know how while the market is, you know, struck while the iron's hot, pretty
2414400	2415400	much?
2415400	2417520	I really don't want to put any speculation on it.
2417520	2419000	I really don't.
2419000	2423240	Because I build myself way too much up to be too excited about something.
2423240	2426720	I want to wait for something a little bit more concrete before I make my judgment.
2426720	2428880	Comment from your chat room, chat.orangelandraday.com.
2428880	2432960	ActDeaf says, the countdown is a countdown for a countdown for a countdown for a countdown.
2432960	2435640	Yeah, I'm getting kind of sick of that crap too.
2435640	2436640	You know what I mean?
2436640	2437640	Just announce it.
2437640	2439040	Announce it or don't.
2439040	2442380	One countdown to a big announcement might be okay.
2442380	2445780	But counting down to another countdown is stupid.
2445780	2448600	Very stupid.
2448600	2453120	One Night Stands in Chat says, was the 5 outline a definite 5 or could it have been an S?
2453120	2454120	Very good comment.
2454120	2457040	Some people are speculating it might have been an S. So maybe it's a new like Metal
2457040	2460160	Gear Solid S type game or something.
2460160	2462200	Let me look at it for a second.
2462200	2468900	It was kind of like, well it's one of those like fonts where it's very like pixelated.
2468900	2471960	So it could be a 5 or an S. Very easy.
2471960	2475340	Let me have a look if it loads.
2475340	2476340	It's not loading.
2476340	2477340	My computer is being a butthole.
2477340	2478340	Trust me.
2478340	2480840	It could be either one.
2480840	2482840	Let's see.
2482840	2487020	Other comments, Alpha Cananagram in Chat says, it's just an announcement.
2487020	2488020	Which is true.
2488020	2489020	It's only an announcement.
2489020	2490960	It's not something we should get too excited about.
2490960	2493920	So there you go.
2493920	2496840	Well how about something that might be worth getting excited about.
2496840	2502240	I mean if you don't have iTunes or an iPhone I guess.
2502240	2506440	PSP and maybe having a music download service.
2506440	2508280	Sony's been thinking about it.
2508280	2511960	They released a survey in January to check for consumer interest.
2511960	2519320	So it seems that they are considering on having other recording companies work with them.
2519320	2522880	And Sony, they have their own music division.
2522880	2525780	But they're just thinking about it right now.
2525780	2530480	So they might have a digital music download but maybe not.
2530480	2531480	It might happen.
2531480	2532480	They're thinking about it.
2532480	2535760	They're sending their little slimy tentacles out to feel for it.
2535760	2538200	I'm kind of surprised it's one of those things they haven't been thinking about for quite
2538200	2539200	some time.
2539200	2540200	You know what I mean?
2540200	2541200	Like I don't know.
2541200	2544320	A lot of, again I use the whole college kid thing.
2544320	2546200	Who do PSP's sell best to?
2546200	2547200	College kids.
2547200	2551720	To replace iPods because they do everything else like games and the internet and all this.
2551720	2554720	So it kind of seems like one of those things that I'm surprised they didn't do this a long
2554720	2556480	freaking time ago.
2556480	2559320	Especially when you consider the fact, what else does Sony have?
2559320	2562560	A big music label, right?
2562560	2564800	So why is this taking so long?
2564800	2572560	Sony's got a big, they're big stinky tentacle fingers in the music industry so why not?
2572560	2576280	I just think though that they tend to behave a bit conservatively when they don't need
2576280	2577440	to.
2577440	2578680	Have you noticed that?
2578680	2580840	Eh, I guess a little bit.
2580840	2584400	They'll venture out into something that they think is innovative and new but with something
2584400	2586760	that they see as tried and true.
2586760	2590040	They're like, ehhh, I don't wanna.
2590040	2591040	They're doing it.
2591040	2592040	I don't wanna.
2592040	2600120	Alpha Canonogram in chat says, Sky they did, it was called Connect, the ATRAC Atorac 3
2600120	2601760	store which closed down.
2601760	2603200	They were planning on doing it.
2603200	2604200	Hmm, interesting.
2604200	2605200	I don't remember that.
2605200	2607480	Was that something for just the PSP specifically?
2607480	2611200	Or was that something to, you know, there were like a million people that were gonna
2611200	2615120	launch something to compete with iTunes and very few of them succeeded.
2615120	2618360	I mean you could say that Napster somewhat succeeded because it's a different business
2618360	2619360	model.
2619360	2625280	I think the biggest competition for iTunes has probably been, what, Amazon.com maybe?
2625280	2629200	But I mean, what else is out there that's successfully competed with iTunes?
2629200	2634240	And when I say successfully, carries a market share even one tenth the size of what Apple
2634240	2635240	has.
2635240	2636240	No.
2636240	2637240	No one.
2637240	2638240	It's practically a monopoly on Apple's part.
2638240	2640240	Yeah, so and that's what they're kind of saying there in chat.
2640240	2645060	So is this something new that maybe is trying to launch and Alpha Canonogram confirms Connect
2645060	2646060	with Sony's iTunes.
2646060	2649320	Okay, well a million people tried to launch something to compete with iTunes and they
2649320	2651600	all failed because none of them stood out.
2651600	2655240	It was too much competition amongst each other and iTunes already had the, you know, they
2655240	2660140	had the player to go with the store.
2660140	2663920	But also, oh I want to read this comment from Marissa Congusto in chat.
2663920	2666100	Yes, that's right, it's Marissa.
2666100	2669280	My dad thought he was doing me a big favor getting me a mini disc player instead of an
2669280	2671980	iPod ages ago, facepalm.
2671980	2672980	That's alright.
2672980	2673980	I feel your pain.
2673980	2674980	I want a mini disc player.
2674980	2675980	I have an HD DVD player.
2675980	2680520	I actually want a mini disc player pretty badly, they do some good things with mini
2680520	2681520	discs.
2681520	2682520	Really?
2682520	2684800	It's still, I think somewhat supported in Japan.
2684800	2685800	Huh.
2685800	2686800	Weird.
2686800	2690440	But you know, it's another example where Sony's tried to go, huh, we're going to do all this
2690440	2691440	new stuff.
2691440	2697240	I mean, Betamax, Betamax was better, mini disc was great, but the first thing that they've
2697240	2700860	done in a long time that really caught on, I think like that was Blu-ray.
2700860	2704240	One Night Stands in Chat asks, wasn't Zune a competitor for iTunes?
2704240	2709240	Zune was a competitor for the iPod, and certainly Microsoft launched their own store to go with
2709240	2714560	it, but it didn't really go, you know, one could argue with me whether it was successful
2714560	2718640	or not, but I think it's pretty clear iTunes has by far the most dominant share.
2718640	2719640	You know what I mean?
2719640	2722260	Like it hasn't really put a blip on the radar of what iTunes has.
2722260	2726360	So whether they're still supporting that whole Microsoft marketplace or what, I don't know.
2726360	2728160	But we'll see.
2728160	2731760	Well how about some happy, happy, happy news?
2731760	2734720	Just a moment, let me talk about this PSP rental service here real quick.
2734720	2739680	There was a PSP survey that was hinting that a rental service might be on its way to the
2739680	2744760	PSP, which is kind of interesting because we know that the PSP, you know, there's this
2744760	2749360	new PSP coming out that nobody's confirming, but we all know it's probably happening, it's
2749360	2755060	going to be announced at E3 this year, that's a discless PSP.
2755060	2758040	It's kind of interesting, one thing they're thinking about doing is a rental service,
2758040	2763000	and this is something that I guess was hinted at by a survey that came out recently that
2763000	2766920	Sony's doing to market to see the potential for a rental service.
2766920	2768240	Wouldn't that be interesting?
2768240	2775660	I don't think we've ever seen anything like this in the years of video gaming, where instead
2775660	2781560	of a company boo-hooing and yelling and bitching and screaming about blockbusters and Hollywood
2781560	2786960	videos and places that rent video games and how they chip into game sales, a company deciding
2786960	2790560	to, well hell, we'll do game rentals of our own.
2790560	2795040	If you can't beat them, join them, and we'll compete with them directly.
2795040	2800120	Very interesting, if this actually happens, that could be kind of interesting, I mean
2800120	2801120	why not?
2801120	2806960	Apple has proved that it can happen with the movies on iTunes, why not rent games through
2806960	2807980	a similar service?
2807980	2811320	This could be big if it's true, you know, it's all kind of a big grain of salt right
2811320	2814560	now because a survey isn't the official word, but it could be very interesting.
2814560	2817200	Well, it could be.
2817200	2819720	Alright, that's all I had.
2819720	2821920	Well, I did have my happy news.
2821920	2822920	Sure!
2822920	2825080	It has been confirmed!
2825080	2829200	We are getting Tatsunoko vs Capcom in the US.
2829200	2838260	The Nintendo power scan was true, and Capcom said on their Twitter that Tatsunoko vs Capcom
2838260	2847120	is being localized for a US release, well US, Canada, North America, whatever.
2847120	2852440	And the quote says, Cat is officially out of the bag on Capcom Mystery Game number 1
2852440	2854480	and linked to the scan.
2854480	2860040	And then there was also one made by Capcom Unity on their blog.
2860040	2865480	But there's one more mystery game they should be having at E3, so I hope it doesn't suck.
2865480	2870160	That Arinean chat is yelling out with online and bug fixes, god I hope that's true.
2870160	2873800	Why not, especially if it's true they have to cut back a few characters, well then hell,
2873800	2874800	let's make it better!
2874800	2877360	But the characters that were listed on there aren't even in the damn game anyway.
2877360	2882040	Oh, oh yeah, we had some back and forth last week on whether those characters were really
2882040	2883040	going to be there or not.
2883040	2887520	The only gachamon characters that were in the game is Ken and June.
2887520	2888520	Joe wasn't in it.
2888520	2892640	If Joe was in it, I'd be screaming, because I'd want him in the release.
2892640	2900920	Arinean chat says, Sky mystery game number 2 is Mega Man Legends 3 on Wii.
2900920	2905920	God I hope you're, if you're lying to me, so help me god, that would be amazing though
2905920	2907120	if that's the mystery game.
2907120	2909080	I would love that.
2909080	2912320	But it seems like it's all speculation to me.
2912320	2913440	We'll see.
2913440	2916240	By the way, we were talking about the Zune earlier, and we actually have some news about
2916240	2920880	the Zune, including some leaked images of what is supposed to be the Zune X, which I
2920880	2925400	guess you could think of as, you know, Microsoft's little competitor to the iPhone.
2925400	2927560	We talked about this a little bit last week.
2927560	2931600	Apparently yeah, some new images have come out, and I guess the best way I could describe
2931600	2935620	this, since this is radio and I can't really show you the images, is it looks kind of like
2935620	2937680	a scaled down PSP.
2937680	2941600	Very rectangular in shape though, not that round shape, and you definitely have the four
2941600	2942600	buttons there on the side.
2942600	2945740	It's just four buttons and a crosshair, and it looks like what's, I'm sorry, the cross
2945740	2949140	pad, and definitely what looks to be some shoulder buttons.
2949140	2951900	I don't know though, kind of take this with a grain of salt, but if some of this is to
2951900	2953840	be believed, then this could be pretty cool.
2953840	2959280	Again, this is supposed to have a micro SD slot, SIM card tray, support for Bluetooth
2959280	2962840	headphones in it, some optical digital output in there as well.
2962840	2968640	Apparently it will actually work with Zune X originals, Xbox Live and on live ready game
2968640	2969640	streaming.
2969640	2974360	There'll be a 32 gigabyte flash drive, and the battery is built in and rechargeable.
2974360	2976360	And it will bake scones.
2976360	2978060	It just well might.
2978060	2979060	And run Linux.
2979060	2980060	So we'll see.
2980060	2982280	Maybe there will be more info about this at E3.
2982280	2986040	I dare whoever gets one of these to put Linux on it.
2986040	2988400	That'll make me go squee for a little bit.
2988400	2992480	Well, this is something that probably won't make people squee, although to be completely
2992480	2996000	honest, I don't think anyone will really freaking give a damn.
2996000	3003400	Watchmen The End is Nigh, the second episode of it is not coming out for PC, and sad trombone
3003400	3004440	I guess.
3004440	3013400	It will come out on Xbox 360 and PS3, but of course it's also going to be selling like
3013400	3020200	a special edition that has this and the first episode on it.
3020200	3024000	Warner is doing the Watchmen The End is Nigh Complete Experience.
3024000	3028600	It has the PS3 versions and the director's cut of the film on Blu-ray.
3028600	3032560	So maybe that'll be worth buying, because the movie was freaking good, but meh, the
3032560	3037080	rest of it, meh, who cares?
3037080	3038880	I can fart better games.
3038880	3044200	Well, somebody out there might care, you don't know.
3044200	3046000	Maybe.
3046000	3048920	Question in the chat room that I kind of like, and this is a very unpronounceable name and
3048920	3056500	I'm sorry, but rlbx327 asks, how would the new PSP work if a person does not have an
3056500	3057500	internet connection?
3057500	3059080	How would that work?
3059080	3062000	That's a great question, one that we'd all like to know the answer to as well, I'm hoping
3062000	3063840	we'll get some results at E3.
3063840	3068400	I don't know if maybe you can take it into a game store and buy things that way, but
3068400	3071560	I guess the assumption is everybody has an internet connection at this point.
3071560	3074280	It's like the DS download stations, could be something similar?
3074280	3075280	I guess.
3075280	3078840	I mean, there's definitely ways around it, but I think they just assume everybody has
3078840	3084160	an internet connection, and even dial up if you have to, but who has dial up anymore?
3084160	3087200	I guess, well I shouldn't say that, because there'll be somebody that sends me a message.
3087200	3093640	Me, I have dial up, my parents have dial up, but geez, my iPod 3G's faster than their internet
3093640	3099440	at home on dial up, but I guess some areas still aren't wired for broadband, but I guess
3099440	3106120	you could still use a PSP Go on dial up, but maybe Sony is only marketing to those people
3106120	3107760	that have internet connections.
3107760	3112720	I mean, let's face it, a vast portion of the population has an internet connection that's
3112720	3113720	fast.
3113720	3118440	If every one of them bought a PSP Go, they would do very well, so why bother catering
3118440	3121760	to those that don't have an internet connection, right?
3121760	3125720	Yeah, well, this is the modern world, everyone's supposed to be connected.
3125720	3129640	Super X-Link in chat has an interesting comment, go to a free Wi-Fi spot.
3129640	3133280	Remember when, I think it was Nintendo did that at all the McDonalds, the McDonalds or
3133280	3134280	something like that?
3134280	3140400	I don't remember, so, anyhow, some more stories involving Capcom, actually, and talking about
3140400	3141400	E3.
3141400	3146280	Apparently, it is going around that Capcom of Japan is apparently going to be pulling
3146280	3147280	out of E3.
3147280	3150400	Now, this doesn't mean that Capcom is not going to have a booth or anything like that,
3150400	3155080	it just means that the international travel looks to be pulling out of E3.
3155080	3159100	This is due to concern over, guess what, swine flu.
3159100	3163480	That's right, apparently the Japanese branch of the company, they are not committing fully
3163480	3169800	to attending the E3, they are still contemplating what to do about the swine flu outbreak that's
3169800	3176360	going on in Keihanshin, which is where Capcom's main office is in Japan.
3176360	3179620	Very interesting, and what they're already saying is that because of this, Dead Rising
3179620	3181800	2 is not going to be showing up at E3.
3181800	3186760	Capcom has confirmed that Dead Rising 2 is not going to be there at E3.
3186760	3191280	And this has to do with Japanese government restrictions and the advisory in Japan right
3191280	3192500	now.
3192500	3199780	By the way, doesn't just end there, Square, Koei, also not attending E3 from their Japanese
3199780	3203640	branches because of, apparently, swine flu concerns.
3203640	3209160	A quote from an article on gamepolitics.com, quote, Square Enix has canceled plans for
3209160	3213460	its Kingdom Hearts team to attend the show, whilst Koei has confirmed that an unspecified
3213460	3217920	number of its Japanese employees will not be traveling to the event.
3217920	3219120	That's sad face.
3219120	3220760	Very, very sad.
3220760	3222880	And also incredibly freaking stupid.
3222880	3227060	It is incredibly stupid to still be concerned about the swine flu, my god.
3227060	3229640	How many people contracted swine flu, like what, 800?
3229640	3230640	How many people died?
3230640	3231640	10?
3231640	3234380	Yeah, maybe 10 at most, but there was a couple, granted there was a couple thousand that got
3234380	3237360	swine flu, but how many people get regular flu?
3237360	3238360	All the time!
3238360	3239840	Fucking shit.
3239840	3245800	This is a mass hysteria pandemic thing to sell flu masks and get people to think about
3245800	3248240	something other than the war or something, you know?
3248240	3249380	It's just stupid.
3249380	3250380	It's fabricated.
3250380	3251380	It's fabricated.
3251380	3256720	There's been outbreaks of swine flu before, and it did just about as much damage.
3256720	3261280	The only reason it did more damage is because we had less medical technology to deal with
3261280	3262280	it.
3262280	3263280	Seriously.
3263280	3265520	I'm just, ugh.
3265520	3270320	So the fact that stupid swine flu or H1N1 or whatever the fuck you want to call it is
3270320	3271320	ruining E3.
3271320	3272320	Fuck people.
3272320	3291000	I say we dedicate the FUs of the week to this.
3291000	3295880	My FU of the week goes to just those stupid people who are willing to believe any and
3295880	3301680	everything that they see on TV, on the internet, you gullible, gullible fucking sheep.
3301680	3303560	I hope you get swine flu.
3303560	3304720	Just get it.
3304720	3313800	I hope you get swine flu of the colon and can do nothing but shit viruses or something.
3313800	3314800	That's what I wish.
3314800	3317000	I love you stupid people.
3317000	3318000	Wow.
3318000	3319000	Swine.
3319000	3322960	And also I want Dick Cheney to shut up.
3322960	3325280	And I just want, I just want people to shut up.
3325280	3327480	I want people to just shut up.
3327480	3328480	Stop it.
3328480	3330480	Knock it the fuck off.
3330480	3333320	Knock it the fuck off.
3333320	3334320	Swine flu.
3334320	3335320	YouTube.
3335320	3336320	No, I'm kidding.
3336320	3337320	No, seriously.
3337320	3342640	I just want people to think for themselves, to think intelligently.
3342640	3348640	And really I want all of those networks, especially Fox news, may they burn in hell forever.
3348640	3353640	I want, I want them to, I want real news on my TV.
3353640	3354640	I want real news.
3354640	3356520	I want what's actually going on in the world.
3356520	3359440	I want to know what's going on outside of America.
3359440	3361480	Do you hear me CNN?
3361480	3368200	That's why BBC news, BBC America's news owns yours completely and utterly.
3368200	3369200	Sorry.
3369200	3370200	It just does.
3370200	3371200	And I like CNN.
3371200	3375800	I like CNN much better than Fox news because Fox news is the, the shit that rats shit.
3375800	3376800	Okay.
3376800	3383120	It's like the, the feces of slugs and I hate slugs.
3383120	3384360	You know, you get more accuracy.
3384360	3386000	You should have a political talk show.
3386000	3393120	I have a blog whenever I post on it, but I mean, seriously, it's like, I think it's completely
3393120	3397920	sad to find out anything that's actually going on in America and in the world.
3397920	3400440	I have to go to BBC.
3400440	3407520	It should be CNN or one of the good networks reporting our shit properly.
3407520	3417360	So a big, big finger to our American media, a big finger to the gullible people who believe
3417360	3418360	it.
3418360	3427400	You know, I have a, I have a magnet on my door of my refrigerator that says, um, bless
3427400	3431080	them to the effect of respect people that seek the truth, doubt those who find it.
3431080	3432080	Wow.
3432080	3433960	Can I talk now?
3433960	3434960	Yeah.
3434960	3437560	Uh, I actually don't have a lot, so that's fine.
3437560	3438560	You went a little long.
3438560	3439560	Does not really have anything.
3439560	3441120	My FU goes to drama.
3441120	3446940	I just, I'm sick of it and I choose not to be around it, so whatever.
3446940	3449120	I got better things to do.
3449120	3450420	That's right.
3450420	3452120	Better things.
3452120	3453200	That's it for the FUs of the week.
3453200	3456840	How about something a little more pleasant, uh, even though this might drive us to some
3456840	3457840	FUs too.
3457840	3460640	Apparently our mailbag is quite thin this week and that's very sad.
3460640	3466160	Uh, mailbag orange laundry.com is the place to send your emails and one of the only dark
3466160	3468720	soccer will read them as she'll do right now.
3468720	3469720	What?
3469720	3473600	We have like one, two, maybe one actually that came in while we were broadcasting cheeseburger.
3473600	3474600	All right.
3474600	3478640	Hey guys, I'm curious about your opinions on the new Star Trek movie.
3478640	3481880	I've seen it three times in a theater.
3481880	3485720	I'm 15 and I'm obsessed with Star Wars, but I never really saw anything in Star Trek.
3485720	3489640	I saw the movie two weeks ago with no expectations because I've never experienced anything Star
3489640	3490640	Trek before.
3490640	3494080	I was blown away and it was the first movie I had ever gone to where everyone clapped
3494080	3495080	at the end.
3495080	3497400	Actually, all three times I saw that people clapped.
3497400	3501720	Um, I knew I wanted to see it again as I was leaving the theater, which I did yesterday
3501720	3503120	and plan to again next week.
3503120	3507780	I plan on buying the old shows and movies on eBay to catch up on some of the older stuff.
3507780	3512760	I have researched some stuff about the movie and I'd like to say, uh, red shirt guy dies
3512760	3513760	if you know what that means.
3513760	3514760	You're awesome.
3514760	3517600	If you don't go look it up, it's not really a spoiler, just something they threw in from
3517600	3518600	the old series.
3518600	3519600	Dude.
3519600	3521000	I will give you the rule right now.
3521000	3525280	If you're wearing a red shirt and no one knows who you are, you are going to die.
3525280	3529640	You know, next generation is yellow, but security officers die.
3529640	3530640	Red shirt.
3530640	3535960	In fact, they sell on ThinkGeek a red, a red ringer t-shirt that says expendable on it
3535960	3537960	in the Star Trek font.
3537960	3538960	Nice.
3538960	3542040	Um, I will go ahead and say something and I've said this before.
3542040	3544440	I was not a Trekkie originally.
3544440	3545880	I was a Whovian.
3545880	3549240	I grew up watching Doctor Who on PBS and not watching Star Trek.
3549240	3553400	Although I've seen a number of the original episodes and almost all of next generation
3553400	3558400	and maybe a smattering here of DS9 and, uh, you know, Voyager.
3558400	3563200	And I watched three episodes of Enterprise and decided it was shit, but there are references
3563200	3566240	to all the other series all throughout the movie.
3566240	3573200	Like, um, I was just saying, you know, like the scene where they go into, you know, the,
3573200	3578440	the Delta Vega, you know, place and there's a Tribble just sitting there going, hi, I'm
3578440	3584600	a Tribble and you know, it's, I actually, you know, I purchased something recently that
3584600	3588840	was like the best four episodes of Star Trek ever, the original series, and they're great
3588840	3589840	episodes.
3589840	3594240	And I want to say, if you want to get a feel for the original series that will give you
3594240	3598760	a decent smattering of what to expect, just get this.
3598760	3606400	It's four episodes and among them are, um, the, one of them is, uh, Trouble with Tribbles,
3606400	3609880	which is supposed to be like the big favorite and I love that episode.
3609880	3618720	And also, um, it's just fantastic, but yeah, go, go get some of those little samples first,
3618720	3620400	see how you feel about it.
3620400	3624280	Um, I like next generation going back and watching a bunch of it though, you're going
3624280	3626640	to find it really dated.
3626640	3629920	The old stuff will hold up because you expect it to be old, but next generation we're talking
3629920	3633840	about when I was, you know, early high school, which next generation now, believe it or not,
3633840	3635160	is getting to be 20 years old.
3635160	3636160	Yeah.
3636160	3637160	Like, Oh boy.
3637160	3642800	But, um, DS9, you know, I didn't watch much of it.
3642800	3646080	I'm actually going to be going back and watching a bunch of it just because from what I understand
3646080	3648400	is probably the best of the series.
3648400	3650660	Um, Voyager has its ups and downs.
3650660	3651660	I've seen crap episodes.
3651660	3655480	I've seen great episodes and yeah, I'm sorry, Jerry Ryan is hot.
3655480	3660480	Um, but Enterprise is like, I keep expecting Scott Bakula to jump.
3660480	3661480	I'm sorry to leap.
3661480	3663360	Cause he was, you know, from Quantum Leap.
3663360	3665920	I do want to remind though, Jerry Ryan didn't show up till season four.
3665920	3666920	I know.
3666920	3667920	That's right.
3667920	3670680	Um, by the way, Star Trek, me personally loved it.
3670680	3671680	Loved the movie.
3671680	3672680	Thought it was great.
3672680	3677920	It was, um, you know, it definitely kind of JJ Abrams definitely said, I am fucking turning
3677920	3682600	this car around right the fuck now and taking it a new direction, but it needed it.
3682600	3683920	It needed it.
3683920	3685720	I hope we get a new series out of it.
3685720	3689560	I mean, even if the series isn't related to the movie, I hope it invigorates interest
3689560	3695200	in Star Trek enough that we do get the Uber nerdy series in the Voyager next generation
3695200	3696560	deep space nine cannon.
3696560	3698840	Like, I want to see a new show like that.
3698840	3699840	That's not enterprise.
3699840	3705080	I actually, I'll tell you what they've confirmed, um, uh, writing on the sequel now and got
3705080	3707360	the whole cast.
3707360	3708360	And I'm, don't get me wrong.
3708360	3710960	I'm, I'm thrilled about that too, but where's my weekly dose.
3710960	3712240	You know, I want to see that too.
3712240	3713480	That would be very exciting.
3713480	3716040	I don't think I could watch the movie a million times in the theater.
3716040	3717240	Like dark soccer does.
3717240	3721520	Maybe I'd see it one more time, but, uh, I'll just buy it on Blu-ray when it comes out.
3721520	3725760	I think I might do what, uh, dark soccer is suggesting though and get the, uh, uh, episodes
3725760	3726760	sampling.
3726760	3727760	Cause you're right.
3727760	3729720	I saw those on, uh, what I'm done with it.
3729720	3731320	I have the one with the four episodes on it.
3731320	3735000	I also want to, I really want the next generation movies on Blu-ray.
3735000	3740440	No disrespect to the old movies, but I really want the next generation ones.
3740440	3744640	Cause I went and saw every single one of those in the theater, but I always loved the next
3744640	3745640	generation.
3745640	3747120	Who is your favorite character in all of Star Trek?
3747120	3749760	Well, I have to do it by, by season.
3749760	3750760	Sorry.
3750760	3755720	So original season, um, well in the movie, I'm going to say right now, Scotty, cause
3755720	3756720	I'm sorry.
3756720	3759880	I love Simon Pegg between him and Carl Urban.
3759880	3762320	I'm sorry that that made the movie for me.
3762320	3768720	His, Carl Urban's McCoy was perfect and oh my God, ah, Southern guy, he just did the
3768720	3769720	accent and everything.
3769720	3770720	Just right.
3770720	3771720	It made me really happy.
3771720	3775160	But, but Simon Pegg as Scotty was just like, actually he was probably my favorite in the
3775160	3777120	original series too.
3777120	3778840	Yeah.
3778840	3779840	Next generation.
3779840	3780840	It depends.
3780840	3787800	Cause as a kid, I was that age, I was a Wesley fangirl, but getting older, it's all about
3787800	3794560	Q. All about Q. I love Q. I love every bit of Q. So I actually have to say Q for Voyager
3794560	3800560	as well since we've had Q and I think that the seven and the doctor are funny together.
3800560	3801560	Yeah.
3801560	3802800	The doctor was probably my favorite in Voyager.
3802800	3809800	For DS9, I'd actually have to say, um, Judzia or, um, Worf.
3809800	3811740	I really liked Odo though.
3811740	3813920	My favorite was Guinan.
3813920	3815560	Guinan will always be my favorite.
3815560	3816560	I know.
3816560	3817560	I love Whoopi.
3817560	3818560	What can I say?
3818560	3819560	All right.
3819560	3821960	We're, we're being way too, this is a video game show, but I will say this, the fact that
3821960	3826800	Star Trek is being made into this MMO, please don't suck.
3826800	3827800	Please don't suck.
3827800	3834080	I'm still making the race the O.L.O.R.I.E.N.D. Please, if there's God out there, do not let
3834080	3839100	this game suck because right now, Star Trek is riding such a high, high wave and there
3839100	3844360	is so much potential, but at the same time, there is so much they could fuck up beyond
3844360	3845360	all belief.
3845360	3849920	And I am praying that this game doesn't suck because I will be leaving all my other MMOs
3849920	3850920	to play it.
3850920	3854720	I have to quote Game Guru on this cause honestly, I fully agree with this.
3854720	3858360	Carl Urbans McCoy makes me wonder if reincarnation exists.
3858360	3859360	Yes.
3859360	3860680	All right.
3860680	3863560	Uh, that's it for the mailbag.
3863560	3866800	If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
3866800	3869120	Hey guys, your calls soon.
3869120	3872880	Uh, but first we have a little bit of gaming news for you guys and of course the classic
3872880	3873880	game of the week.
3873880	3877960	We haven't forgot that yet, but, uh, one more news story for you guys has to do with Forza
3877960	3879560	Motorsport 3.
3879560	3881520	I think y'all know it's coming.
3881520	3887480	Y'all know it had to happen and sure enough, the German retail version of amazon.com called
3887480	3896440	amazon.de has listed Forza Motorsport 3, Prima's official game guide out on September 30th.
3896440	3897760	Whoops.
3897760	3901720	Looks like that spilled the beans that Forza Motorsport 3 is coming.
3901720	3904920	Uh, so that means that game is probably coming out around October.
3904920	3907640	The guides usually come out a little bit before the games to help raise hype.
3907640	3911560	Uh, it sounds like the game should come out in Europe in October, which probably is going
3911560	3914480	to be a worldwide, worldwide release kind of thing.
3914480	3921000	Um, granted it could always be a bug, take it with a grain of salt, but, uh, yep.
3921000	3922000	There you go.
3922000	3924720	Forza Motorsport 3 is coming at some point.
3924720	3926800	Um, comments and chat.
3926800	3928400	Why didn't you read my email?
3928400	3929800	Because you sent it too late.
3929800	3930800	Yep.
3930800	3931800	We'll read it next week.
3931800	3932800	All right.
3932800	3933800	Maybe.
3933800	3934800	Maybe.
3934800	3936800	We'll, uh, go to the email or go to, not the emails, we already went to the emails.
3936800	3938800	We'll go to the Classic Game of the Week now.
3938800	3942200	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer likes to dig through the archives and
3942200	3944040	find a game she thinks y'all ought to be playing.
3944040	3945040	So here it is.
3945040	3948040	Classic Game of the Week.
3948040	3949800	Classic Game of the Week is beer pong.
3949800	3950800	Awesome.
3950800	3951800	I'm kidding.
3951800	3952800	It's actually DuckTales.
3952800	3953800	Woo.
3953800	3954800	Woo.
3954800	3955800	Yeah.
3955800	3956800	Yay.
3956800	3958480	It's about damn time I picked this one.
3958480	3961480	I didn't actually put in a gameplay one up because I wanted the music, best music in
3961480	3962480	the game.
3962480	3988320	So anyway, it is, of course, based off of the Disney TV show, and it came out of Nintendo
3988320	3989320	in 1989.
3989320	3995080	And so you basically go around as Scrooge McDuck, who is going around to collect treasures
3995080	3997720	all over the world and the moon.
3997720	4002920	It came out on Game Boy, and it has nothing to do with DuckTales and Quest for Gold.
4002920	4011680	So basically, this is really one of the top Capcom games for the Nintendo.
4011680	4019480	It actually had Tokoru Fujiwara and Yuki-chan's Pop-Up.
4019480	4021440	You gotta read the credits on some of the old Capcom games.
4021440	4022440	I love it.
4022440	4029440	It was really tight to play if you used a Scrooge's cane as a weapon and a poco stick
4029440	4030440	and was non-linear.
4030440	4037520	So basically, you're going around and you're helping NPCs and whacking enemies with a cane
4037520	4041240	and telling them to get off your lawn or whatever.
4041240	4044720	And you can actually play any of the levels in order.
4044720	4046080	Like I said, non-linear.
4046080	4052320	You have a boss you have to fight at the end of each level, two hidden treasures, there's
4052320	4055880	a golden ring in the African mines and a golden mirror in the moon level.
4055880	4061640	And after you've done all that, you go to Transylvania for some reason to do boss fights.
4061640	4065760	So you can keep going back and unlock different parts of the levels and do different stuff.
4065760	4072320	So you've got basically your DuckTales characters, you have Scrooge, you have Kiwi, Dewi, and
4072320	4078920	Lily, Webby, Gizmo, Duck, Launchpad, Maquack, Gyro Gearloose, Ms. Beakley, Bubba, Magica
4078920	4086880	Dispel, who is in Transylvania, Flintheart, Glomgold, and the Beagle Boys.
4086880	4092760	And then you also have an alternate ending in the NES version, where if you finish the
4092760	4103000	game with ten million dollars and have both of the hidden treasures, then you will have
4103000	4107160	the news article come up with Scrooge winning, but he has a crown on his head, and a paper
4107160	4111280	stating that he has stunned the world with his discovery of two lost treasures.
4111280	4114360	So that's pretty cool.
4114360	4116240	So yeah, it was by Capcom.
4116240	4122160	There was actually a beta version that was out too, and actually we were releasing the
4122160	4124920	Consumer's Guide hot tip for Coolest Nintendo's game.
4124920	4128480	They had different levels, there was the Jungle, Ghost House, Underground, Snow Mountain, and
4128480	4129840	Moon Surface.
4129840	4133320	Hamburgers were your power-ups instead of ice cream.
4133320	4143000	The coffins in the Ghost House had crosses on them instead of R.E.P., although if you
4143000	4147720	look in the NES Atlas, there are pictures of the original.
4147720	4152440	The Moon music had a slower tempo music, and I've actually heard it, it's actually pretty
4152440	4153440	good.
4153440	4158480	The Ghost House had a different music track, and Gizmo Duck went by Roboduck.
4158480	4167060	In the French version, it was called La Bande a Pichot, so it's the same DuckTales thing.
4167060	4172720	And there was, the Famicom version was called Wanpaku Daku Yume Boken, which is Naughty Duck's
4172720	4179480	Dream Adventure, and it didn't have all the censorship.
4179480	4184040	So there was a DuckTales 2 game, it was not as popular.
4184040	4196200	So it really though is, and by the way Yuki-chan's papa is Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, so gay, and it's
4196200	4201960	really one of the classic classic classics, and like I had to play the Moon level music
4201960	4208320	first, that is the identifiable stage, you play the beginning of that, and anyone who
4208320	4214760	knows their gaming history will be able to point that right out, so yeah.
4214760	4218240	Alright, maybe that'll be a Capcom surprise announcement.
4218240	4221400	They have a secondary surprise announcement, they're supposed to make it E3, right?
4221400	4224600	How about DuckTales 3 on the Wii?
4224600	4228680	That's the sound you would hear across the world, fanboys shitting their pants.
4228680	4229680	That's right.
4229680	4238200	You know, also though, just to say, you know, if we want to even look at any more of Yoshihiro
4238200	4247760	Sakaguchi's games, we have 1943, well 1943 Kai, we have Final Fight, Legendary Wings,
4247760	4253360	Forgotten Worlds, Mega Man, Mega Man 2, we have Street Fighter, Street Fighter 2, did
4253360	4258720	sound design, Warriors of Fate, so pretty cool.
4258720	4260600	Very cool.
4260600	4264160	One Night Stands asks, hey Dark Soccer, exactly why was this such a great game?
4264160	4267900	I loved it as a kid, but it plays like a lot of other platformers.
4267900	4272760	It just really, it's all of the elements combined, really, when you look at everything together,
4272760	4273760	it's all those pieces.
4273760	4277400	Yeah, I mean, yeah, there were a lot of platformers on the NES, but I think you had so many things
4277400	4278760	falling into place on this one.
4278760	4282880	You had a pretty good game, which is very important, you had a great license.
4282880	4286440	You could go back and do your favorite levels as much as you wanted to.
4286440	4287440	Right?
4287440	4294040	You know, it was kind of like that Mega Man mixed with, I don't know, Mario-style platformer,
4294040	4295040	and great music.
4295040	4297200	I mean, just everything kind of fell into place with this game.
4297200	4305000	I think one other reason, think about all the crap movie and cartoon and TV show tie-in
4305000	4306000	games you have.
4306000	4307000	God, I know, right?
4307000	4311000	DuckTales breaks that mold, and I think for one, that might be one reason why people love
4311000	4314560	it so much, is that DuckTales was actually a pretty enjoyable game at the time it came
4314560	4315560	out.
4315560	4316560	I really think so.
4316560	4317560	That would be my best answer.
4317560	4318560	I really agree with that.
4318560	4322080	That, Rob, dear friend, is a proper assessment.
4322080	4323560	All right, thank you.
4323560	4326160	See, sometimes I say some good things on this program.
4326160	4328940	It doesn't happen very often, but there you go.
4328940	4332640	Tiger Claw says, I think what sets DuckTales apart from other platformers is the game mechanic
4332640	4334620	involving Scrooge's cane.
4334620	4335620	That's true, too.
4335620	4338480	You know, what other game really had that new mechanic of using the cane to kind of
4338480	4343000	knock things around and brought things into puzzles in a different way?
4343000	4346400	But yeah, I mean, it's certainly a fair question to ask.
4346400	4352400	If you have more questions you want to ask us, our Skype line is open right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
4352400	4356320	or our username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio, you can call right now and give us a call.
4356320	4358520	In the meantime, I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories.
4358520	4359520	I don't have anything.
4359520	4360920	I don't think Dark Soccer would have anything.
4360920	4363120	Actually, you never know.
4363120	4365120	Oh, gosh.
4365120	4369960	All right, let's go to the phones.
4369960	4370960	We got a call.
4370960	4371960	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
4371960	4372960	Shut that thing up.
4372960	4373960	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
4373960	4374960	Who's this?
4374960	4375960	Hi, this is Stephanie.
4375960	4376960	Hi, this is Spazinator.
4376960	4377960	Hi, Spazinator.
4377960	4378960	What's on your mind tonight?
4378960	4379960	Not much.
4379960	4393240	I was going to join the IRC chat, but unfortunately it won't work on my PlayStation 3.
4393240	4398880	If you heard the Taylor and Bobby show, I was asking about possibly buying an arcade
4398880	4399880	machine.
4399880	4416520	What I'm specifically looking for is a classic game anywhere from the 80s up until the mid-90s.
4416520	4420260	Let me ask you, are you looking to buy a specific game?
4420260	4424840	You want an actual authentic, this might have sat in a pizzeria back in the 80s type of
4424840	4425840	game.
4425840	4430600	Or you want something, you know, you want something that will play all these games.
4430600	4435720	You want like a main cabinet or you, I guess my question is, are you looking to collect
4435720	4437880	or are you just looking to play?
4437880	4446720	Um, I collect, uh, like the alphemics and singing, maybe the mayor's team and a pizzeria.
4446720	4448400	I would go eBay, honestly.
4448400	4450400	eBay or flea markets.
4450400	4451960	Or even like Craigslist.
4451960	4457280	DeNio's here in the Brisbane Sacramento area, they sell old arcade cabinets.
4457280	4462640	You can even check, um, some of the entertainment companies that rent out the games and ask
4462640	4467280	if they're putting anything for sale, eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, we've come to them that
4467280	4468280	way.
4468280	4471160	And I know this might sound, I know this might sound really cruel, but in this economy you
4471160	4476040	have a lot of places going under, um, especially like arcades and some pizzerias.
4476040	4477640	These places might be unloading their stuff.
4477640	4481600	So look for, you know, listings on Craigslist and so on, but you'd be surprised.
4481600	4483360	eBay is a great place to start.
4483360	4487640	Um, but here's one thing you want to keep in mind, Spaznator, shipping is going to be
4487640	4490060	a arm and a leg for a lot of these games.
4490060	4493960	You might see some really cheap listings, like, you know, a $200 arcade machine.
4493960	4497480	But at that, and if I remember right, you're in upstate New York.
4497480	4501480	So if you buy a game from the West coast, you know, you're going to have to pay an arm
4501480	4503080	and a leg in shipping fees.
4503080	4504920	So you probably want to stick to things.
4504920	4508400	I mean, you could certainly find your widest selection there on eBay, but you would definitely
4508400	4511680	want to stick to things like Craigslist and things that are going to be a little more
4511680	4515320	local in your areas that you don't have to pay that obscene shipping fee.
4515320	4518920	You have the perk of having New York city, not too, too far away.
4518920	4522960	If you're especially willing to drive and pick something up with a pickup truck, you
4522960	4524280	can probably get some good deals.
4524280	4525280	Yeah.
4525280	4528760	The thing is I never drove a day in my life.
4528760	4532040	I never bothered to get my license.
4532040	4539920	And I don't think, well, I don't have any relatives that really live in the area that
4539920	4546680	have a driver's license and have enough, you know, free time on their hands that would
4546680	4555520	be willing to, you know, essentially take me out to wherever, you know, to pick up arcade
4555520	4558160	gatherings and drive me back to my place.
4558160	4559160	Well that's fair.
4559160	4561480	I mean, if you don't have a license yourself, it's going to be kind of harder to get around
4561480	4562480	and stuff.
4562480	4565560	So you may have to just, you know, you may have to fork over those shipping fees, but
4565560	4566600	just be prepared.
4566600	4570620	There's going to be shipping fees and sometimes they're as much as the games are themselves
4570620	4574720	because you're talking about, you know, sending a gigantic cabinet, which basically has to
4574720	4576080	go on the back of a truck.
4576080	4578400	You know, you are going to be spending a couple hundred dollars on shipping.
4578400	4581560	So that's something you got to prepare yourself for when shopping, but if you can afford it,
4581560	4584280	if that's within your budget, go for it.
4584280	4585280	Yeah.
4585280	4593680	Well, you know, if I do decide to go forward with this and get one, it'll probably be probably
4593680	4599240	a few months before I get it, but, you know, I kind of figured, you know, it just would
4599240	4604840	probably go hand in hand with, you know, my councils, you know, it would be a nice conversation
4604840	4611120	for you to talk about and not only that, but, you know, I kind of miss, you know, the whole
4611120	4615320	arcade experience that I used to have when I was, you know, a little kid, you know, going
4615320	4617560	to the pizzerias and playing games.
4617560	4621560	And let me ask you a question actually, Spaznator, since you're about to drop hundreds of dollars
4621560	4626200	possibly on buying one of these machines for the nostalgia, you know, if you're going for
4626200	4629320	the collector's route, you're going to get one game.
4629320	4633060	It's not going to be a main cabin or something like that, that you can fix, switch between
4633060	4634060	the different games.
4634060	4635560	You're going to get one game.
4635560	4639600	And I know there's people that would spend a lot of money to have one game.
4639600	4643000	Like I myself, I don't know that, well, I don't know, I'd have to think about it, but
4643000	4645120	there's certainly some games I would, I would buy.
4645120	4648520	And you know, I see in chat right now, for instance, Brad and from Pod Culture says,
4648520	4651560	I would kill for a classic Star Wars arcade machine.
4651560	4654840	What machine do you think you're going to drop the money on?
4654840	4664560	Um, well, I have like, uh, uh, top five first left, uh, you, uh, it would be like, uh, wall
4664560	4669760	of combat two, uh, super street fighter two turbo.
4669760	4675920	Um, and then of course, uh, killer, uh, killer instance two.
4675920	4682360	And uh, you know, then, uh, like the, you know, Neo Geo MBS, the four swap one.
4682360	4685620	Now that, you know what, look into that.
4685620	4688840	That sounds like it might be a great option for you as those Neo Geo cabinets, because
4688840	4692720	of the fact you can fit like four games in there and that way you get that classic collectible
4692720	4696280	thing mixed in with, uh, Hey, I have more than just one game in here.
4696280	4699520	That might be a good thing to look into, but the good news is with those fighting games,
4699520	4701600	they made so many of them, especially street fighter twos.
4701600	4703880	I'm sure you wouldn't have a hard time finding one at all.
4703880	4707280	Finding a working one might be more of a challenge, but you never know people.
4707280	4709760	I mean, there's people that fix that shit up as a hobby.
4709760	4711280	So you might be, yeah.
4711280	4712280	Yeah.
4712280	4713280	Yeah.
4713280	4717520	I kind of figured with the, at least with the fighting games, it's, uh, at least joysticks
4717520	4718520	on them.
4718520	4722800	Those two stars are going to be kind of beating out the joysticks themselves will probably
4722800	4723800	beat these off.
4723800	4724800	Yep.
4724800	4725800	All right.
4725800	4727360	Well, a spasinator, we're going to let you go, but good luck in your quest.
4727360	4728360	Okay.
4728360	4729360	All right.
4729360	4730360	Thank you very much.
4730360	4731360	No problem.
4731360	4732360	Let us know when you get one.
4732360	4733360	Okay.
4733360	4734360	Goodbye.
4734360	4735360	Wow.
4735360	4737560	That was kind of a funny goodbye message there.
4737560	4742680	Uh, this kind of caused some, uh, my question to spasinator kind of caused this, uh, snowball
4742680	4747200	and chat talking about what games, uh, they would pay money for an S2 100.
4747200	4748560	Matt wanted to throw out there.
4748560	4751000	I would tell him to look for arcades that are closing down.
4751000	4754440	Um, some other comments in chat, I want to say real quick, uh, one night stands said
4754440	4756560	he would pay the money for X-Men arcade.
4756560	4759560	Renee says, prop cycle, the poor man's DDR.
4759560	4761840	Vid power says Simpsons arcade.
4761840	4763880	Um, and let's see what else is there.
4763880	4764880	Uh, captain.
4764880	4765880	Yes.
4765880	4767200	Said I would kill for a super scope cabinet.
4767200	4768680	So there you go.
4768680	4771640	Um, and we just had Skype crash.
4771640	4772640	That was weird.
4772640	4773640	At least didn't crash my whole computer.
4773640	4774640	Thank God.
4774640	4777400	Skype just crashed sadly, and I was in the middle of a call when it did.
4777400	4779520	So, so I apologize to the caller.
4779520	4782760	Hopefully they will be able to get through again, but I am firing Skype back up so we
4782760	4785520	can take more calls and we look like we're back up.
4785520	4786880	Sorry about that.
4786880	4788520	That's kind of crappy.
4788520	4790280	One eight seven seven game.
4790280	4793160	Oler username on Skype, live radio guys.
4793160	4796600	Sometimes Skype will crash on us as we're doing the show live.
4796600	4797600	Yeah.
4797600	4801600	I like what Bobby and Chad is saying, uh, talking about getting a 2d X cabinet.
4801600	4804760	You know, I think if I were to drop the money, I'd have to get something Bemani related.
4804760	4808800	Yeah, I think I'd get a 2d X and probably honestly I think I'd want a happy sky.
4808800	4809800	We'll see.
4809800	4810800	Hey, we got another call.
4810800	4811800	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
4811800	4812800	Who's this?
4812800	4813800	Wow.
4813800	4814800	I can't believe I got through for this.
4814800	4815800	This is my first time calling.
4815800	4816800	This is excellent.
4816800	4817800	Well, hi, excellent.
4817800	4818800	Congratulations on making it through.
4818800	4821600	You might've lucked out cause some other, unfortunately we were on the line with another
4821600	4825880	call and then Skype crashed and I really feel bad, but that's just live radio sometimes
4825880	4828520	and Hey, you got through and you've never been on before.
4828520	4830000	So what's on your mind?
4830000	4837000	Well, first off, I, I don't know about exactly about the pinball games exactly, uh, uh, arcade.
4837000	4838000	I'm sorry.
4838000	4839000	Arcade games.
4839000	4841440	I know about more, a little more about pinballs than I do arcade because I used to work on
4841440	4842840	them working at arcade.
4842840	4848920	But um, yeah, the, um, the, the ones like street fighters and the use of those ones
4848920	4852320	are a little more commonplace to find than you would with some of the other ones.
4852320	4855040	Um, the more newer they are, the easier to find.
4855040	4859060	Of course, the more harder they're fine is the more older they are.
4859060	4863360	So you really would have to search and I know he's overseas, so that'd probably be even
4863360	4867000	more hard than it is over here in the U S where it's just a tad bit more commonplace
4867000	4870960	maybe than say like over there in Sweden.
4870960	4877080	Uh, it really depends on all of those factors, but I do agree the best way to find an arcade
4877080	4880040	game without having to pay all the shipping, look for an, look for an arcade near you that's
4880040	4881040	closing down.
4881040	4882040	Yeah.
4882040	4883040	No joke.
4883040	4884040	I'm bad.
4884040	4888080	Like I said, before we closed down, unfortunately my arcade, we had like four and a half pages
4888080	4890080	full of arcade, different arcade games.
4890080	4893520	So I mean, yeah, if you find one that's nearly getting ready to close down, you probably
4893520	4896080	can pick one up for a good price.
4896080	4897080	Well there you go.
4897080	4900760	Hopefully the advice will be taken, even though I think that last caller wasn't overseas,
4900760	4904380	they're upstate New York, but I know we do have other listeners that are overseas that
4904380	4907400	can take that, um, uh, advice to heart.
4907400	4909720	Well what else is on your mind?
4909720	4910720	Glee.
4910720	4911720	Great show.
4911720	4912720	First off.
4912720	4920760	Yes, I was calling more in tone to THQ and their golden Wii that they sent over to overseas
4920760	4921760	there.
4921760	4922760	Yes.
4922760	4926600	Glee was amazing, by the way, if folks need a new TV show to watch, even though there's
4926600	4931280	only the one episode, definitely reminded me of being a music geek in high school.
4931280	4936020	But ah, yes, we actually were gonna, before we made it a short show tonight when Loki
4936020	4938860	wasn't able to be here, we were gonna talk about the golden Wii.
4938860	4941960	Tell us a little bit about this and what you wanted to say about it.
4941960	4948440	THQ, which unfortunately lost a major amount of money over the last year, which I thought
4948440	4954800	that was even more ironic, decided to send a golden Wii overseas to the UK to give to
4954800	4958380	the queen as a thank you.
4958380	4959380	For what?
4959380	4960380	A thank you for what?
4960380	4961380	Just being queenly?
4961380	4965960	Well, as a, as a, as a way to promoting their new game.
4965960	4966960	Gotcha.
4966960	4970840	I was gonna say though, come on, I don't think the queen is really gonna play this
4970840	4971840	Wii.
4971840	4977040	She's obviously a little old and I think every time I've seen her in, in, you know, on TV
4977040	4980280	and stuff, she seems to be, have limited mobility.
4980280	4983680	I'm sure someone would argue with me whether that means she can't play the Wii or not,
4983680	4986840	but you know, come on, she's a queen, she's the freaking queen of England.
4986840	4989920	I think she's got better things to do than sit there and play the Wii.
4989920	4993960	However, I think it's one of those things that you'll see in a museum someday as the
4993960	4997640	Wii the queen once owned, even though she never touched it.
4997640	5002920	Supposedly she, she has a, uh, supposedly she was playing the Wii before with the prince.
5002920	5006480	Supposedly there was articles about that, so that's why they sent her over one, so she
5006480	5007480	could have one of her own.
5007480	5012800	I stand corrected, what a great photo op that must have been.
5012800	5016680	I just like to see her play Mike Tyson's punch out, I think that'd be even funnier.
5016680	5021100	I don't know about that, I, she probably was playing something, probably Wii bowling, cause
5021100	5026040	I know that's something that, uh, this is gonna sound terrible, especially considering
5026040	5029600	I'm talking about the queen of England, but look, this is life, part of life is getting
5029600	5030600	old.
5030600	5033920	Uh, the Wii bowling is really popular in, like, senior citizen centers, and like, all
5033920	5037480	these things, like, they'll actually have Wii bowling night at the senior citizen center
5037480	5042000	and all these really fun things, so I betcha that's what she was playing, if anything.
5042000	5043800	And if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong again.
5043800	5044800	What else is new?
5044800	5047680	Nah, that's pretty much about it I can think of.
5047680	5051260	I'm looking forward to seeing what comes out of E3 in a couple weeks out of all these rumors
5051260	5054080	and stuff, and see which ones are true and which ones are false.
5054080	5055080	Me too.
5055080	5059160	So, out of curiosity, what do you, since, you know, OLR can't compete with the commercial
5059160	5064080	sites, what do you want us to bring you from E3?
5064080	5067600	Whatever news is not given, I guess, because a lot of it's gonna be hard, because a lot
5067600	5071000	of the news, as soon as it's gonna break, is gonna be put all, posted all over the web
5071000	5073920	and Twitter and Facebook and all that, so.
5073920	5079000	It's gonna be harder this year, cause there's no Kensha Hall for everyone to ignore, or
5079000	5083920	do the nice fluff piece that is, uh, you know, the one article on the entirety of Kensha
5083920	5084920	Hall.
5084920	5088440	And from what I understand, we're not having that this year, so, uh, it's gonna be difficult
5088440	5093700	to really dig around, but we will try to find the Kensha in E3 for you guys.
5093700	5099720	What I would like to see is maybe even, you know, like, what the independent people are
5099720	5100720	doing.
5100720	5103920	What are some of these games that are blowkey that should have been up to par, you know,
5103920	5108160	that should have been, you know, the major hits that are maybe not as hits.
5108160	5111640	I will do my best to dig up the independent stuff for you guys, and I think that's where
5111640	5114400	we're gonna have to find our niche this year, is that I bet there's a lot of people that
5114400	5119760	want to be heard, and they're gonna be excited, uh, to have somebody care, and, uh, certainly,
5119760	5122640	you know what, let's find the next Braid.
5122640	5124800	Let's find the next Katamari Damacy.
5124800	5128720	Let's find that next big thing that hasn't been discovered yet.
5128720	5129720	I like that idea.
5129720	5133280	All right, well, XLink, we gotta let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank
5133280	5137320	you so much, first time caller, and, uh, we'll, uh, call us again sometime.
5137320	5138320	Oh, definitely.
5138320	5140320	All right, later, dude.
5140320	5141320	Thanks.
5141320	5142320	Uh, we'll take some more calls.
5142320	5147400	Uh, by the way, some other comments from Chat Rehman, what they want to see from E3, rlbx327
5147400	5152400	wants to know about the iPhone games at E3, uh, actdef says, King of Fighter XII details.
5152400	5155680	You know, I did get an email about a pre-tournament that's going on, but it's going on, like,
5155680	5160320	I think the Sunday before E3, so, sadly, we'll still be here, we can't go, but I know there's
5160320	5165360	gonna be some tournaments going on, uh, AlphaKananagram wants some Katamari Forever footage in a soundtrack
5165360	5166360	bootleg.
5166360	5170400	I don't know how Namco would feel about a bootleg on our site, but we'll try.
5170400	5174120	Ha, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
5174120	5178080	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
5178080	5185880	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio, okay, the caller isn't there, apparently, uh, 1877
5185880	5189520	Game OLR, or username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio, remember, you can always test the calls
5189520	5194480	before giving us a call at Echo123 is the username on Skype, and that's a great way
5194480	5197480	to make sure that your microphone is working and all that fun stuff before you actually
5197480	5198480	call us.
5198480	5201680	Of course, that doesn't work with a touch tone phone, um, touch tone phones are much
5201680	5204600	easier though, you just pick up the phone and call, I don't think I've ever seen a phone
5204600	5208560	not work, although I have seen them be quiet, I've just never seen them, like, not actually
5208560	5209560	work at all.
5209560	5210560	Let's try this again.
5210560	5211560	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
5211560	5214040	Sorry about that, my mic's screwed up, it's Gold Anthro.
5214040	5216200	That's alright, I'm glad you got through, because I know you were the caller that we
5216200	5218160	crashed on earlier, well, what's on your mind?
5218160	5220000	Ah, don't worry about it.
5220000	5226600	Um, well, I guess I could say I had a, uh, quite a weekend, uh, uh, along with, uh, one
5226600	5233480	of the OLR staff members, DJ Ron Mass, I went to Anime Boston 2009 this weekend, on Saturday.
5233480	5234800	Ah, and how was that?
5234800	5238680	I'm happy to hear that, uh, there was some OLR meetups going on, because I know somewhere
5238680	5243340	in the Bay Area right now, GS68 is crying because he's the only OLR guy at Fanime, which
5243340	5248000	I'm very sad I didn't get to this year, but, next year, next year, well, how was Anime
5248000	5249000	Boston?
5249000	5254700	Uh, it was good, um, I guess, uh, it was my first convention, I really didn't know what
5254700	5260360	to expect, but, um, uh, it was pretty good, it was pretty good, um, one of the first things
5260360	5266160	I did was find, uh, DJ Ron Mass, um, he, uh, was selling some stuff, he didn't seem to
5266160	5271160	have any good luck this, uh, weekend, but he said overall he had a good time, I guess,
5271160	5275480	I guess he'll be calling in maybe next week to talk about it, I think he's getting home
5275480	5276480	late.
5276480	5277480	Oh, I'm sure he will.
5277480	5280480	Today's his birthday too, if I'm not mistaken, so happy birthday to you guys, if you're with
5280480	5281480	me.
5281480	5283000	Yes, yes it is, everybody wish him a happy birthday, I know I did.
5283000	5286000	So he's probably out enjoying that and not listening to the show tonight, which I completely
5286000	5287000	understand.
5287000	5290080	Um, here's something I'm gonna ask you, one thing that always impressed me about Anime
5290080	5293120	conventions, you know, I'm not super into Anime, I don't know how much you're into it
5293120	5296560	or what have you, but one thing that always kind of impressed me about the conventions,
5296560	5301680	despite my lack of knowledge, is the art dealer rooms, and some of the fan inspired art that
5301680	5305800	you see in these rooms, um, you know, and this crosses over into video games too, because
5305800	5309060	I'll tell you, you can't walk through one of these, uh, hallways without seeing some
5309060	5311960	Kingdom Hearts inspired, you know, fan art or something.
5311960	5315400	Did you see any art, I don't know if you looked around the art dealer room, did you see some
5315400	5318720	art that really jumped out of you that you thought was awesome, and what was it?
5318720	5324240	I saw a lot of stuff, I saw anything from like, like Anime stuff from like Death Note,
5324240	5329560	if I've seen the typical, stereotypical, stupid Naruto stuff, that's just my opinion, not
5329560	5331600	fact, but I just, that's not my thing.
5331600	5337960	Uh, I also found video game stuff, uh, like basically, uh, what did you say you were wondering
5337960	5338960	if there was there?
5338960	5342560	Oh, I don't know, I know there's always something Kingdom Hearts, but did anything kind of jump
5342560	5343560	out of you?
5343560	5344560	Kingdom Hearts, yes.
5344560	5345560	Okay, let me give you an example.
5345560	5350680	Let me give you an example, when I was at, um, ASEN, I actually bought this, I thought
5350680	5355600	it was so rad, because I bought it for, um, my boyfriend, who, um, I know is a big fan
5355600	5360560	of this, but, um, they actually had an art dealer table, and she had a drawing of David
5360560	5365160	Bowie from Labyrinth, and I just thought that was so awesome, I'm like, how random to find
5365160	5368760	something like that in an Anime con, but did you see anything that like, like, jumped out
5368760	5369760	of you like that?
5369760	5373160	Like, wow, I didn't expect to see that at an art dealer table.
5373160	5380960	Um, I, I, I guess, a lot, pretty much everything was unexpected for me, like I said, this was
5380960	5386560	my first con, I, I saw, I mean, there was someone with little, uh, I also have a friend
5386560	5391800	in chat called our Robocon that doesn't seem to get to listen to OLR a lot, but he tries
5391800	5397720	to catch the podcast, he's live in there now, um, but, uh, we, we went together on Saturday,
5397720	5402160	and I got, I got some, uh, they had like little buttons they were selling for like 50 cents
5402160	5406160	to a hundred, I mean, one dollar, uh, I got like a little thing from The World Ends With
5406160	5411240	You, that little pin that you'd get in the RPG game, that portable RPG game that says
5411240	5415280	you're, you're in, you're in the, uh, game thing, I don't know if you...
5415280	5418960	Oh, yeah, no, I know, I, okay, that's cool, and yeah, The World Ends With You definitely
5418960	5424440	is, uh, has its fans, especially the Squeenix fans, so okay, cool, cool.
5424440	5430120	Yeah, I also saw, I saw something interesting, it was a stained glass thing, um, of various
5430120	5436000	Death Note anime characters, um, it had the character, the Detective L, but it was like
5436000	5441080	a vampire version of him with like blue hair, and it was pretty cool, it was like stained
5441080	5442080	glass.
5442080	5445080	That sounds kind of neat, stained glass is always pretty cool, well look, I want to ask
5445080	5447320	you about this before we let you go, but how about the game room?
5447320	5448320	Sure.
5448320	5451480	I mean, we're video games and gaming, how was the game room in anime Boston?
5451480	5457160	I was, I was going to bring that up, yeah, the game room was, um, it, it was, uh, I think
5457160	5462520	they used like the, uh, Grand Ballroom and the, see this is in Boston, Massachusetts,
5462520	5467960	the Heinz Convention Center, they were, I think they used the ballroom for the, uh,
5467960	5473360	video game thing, uh, when they, what?
5473360	5474360	Go ahead, Will.
5474360	5477080	What kind of games did you see in the room when you went there?
5477080	5483960	Um, I saw, they had a Street Fighter IV tournament going on, they had, uh, I, I finally got to
5483960	5487240	play popin' music, it was pretty, that was a pretty cool experience.
5487240	5489240	I love popin' music.
5489240	5495000	Yeah, I know, uh, that's why I had, that's why I brought that up, and, um, the interesting
5495000	5498920	thing is, they had, they had, they had the Rock Band 2 set up with the, uh, on the Xbox
5498920	5505840	360, the interesting thing I saw was that Nintendo Wii that they had actually was using,
5505840	5509440	running on the homebrew channel, uh, the, uh, homebrew channel, which allows you to
5509440	5515480	run, like, um, self-made applications, among other things, and they were using it for perfectly,
5515480	5518280	uh, legitimate reasons, so I thought, I thought it was kinda cool.
5518280	5519280	Of course.
5519280	5520280	Of course.
5520280	5521560	Okay, I got one more question for you before we let you go, and it actually comes from
5521560	5525400	our chat room, from our good buddy Bobby Black Wolf, heard before us here Sunday nights on
5525400	5526400	All Games Radio.
5526400	5531960	Uh, Bobby asked, Anime Boston is in the same place as PAX Boston is going to be.
5531960	5536480	How was the size of the place, because some people are speculating it may not be big enough
5536480	5538920	for an event the size of PAX.
5538920	5546520	Um, I think, I think that it's, uh, well, I think there's, there's like three floors,
5546520	5552560	um, three, I think it's like a three-floor place, and, uh, we were all around it, and,
5552560	5557280	uh, uh, it's pretty big, it really is, it's, it's bigger than, uh, I thought it was gonna
5557280	5558280	be.
5558280	5562080	Like, there's a, there's a mall that's, like, attached to it, like, uh, and we got some
5562080	5566440	food there afterwards, but, but it's, it's pretty big, I mean, even without that, the
5566440	5571200	convention center itself, I mean, it, it, so yeah, I think it could handle PAX, PAX
5571200	5575400	East, because, I mean, the attendance just keeps climbing every year on Anime Boston
5575400	5578760	as it is, so yeah, it could probably handle that.
5578760	5583380	That's interesting news, because I was, uh, I saw that the, uh, I was expecting it to
5583380	5588400	be Memorial Day weekend the next week, and it wasn't, so I, I saw that it was, like,
5588400	5593480	April 2nd or 4th from, uh, Anime Boston, so probably somebody else, like, took, took the
5593480	5594480	Memorial Day weekend.
5594480	5597600	Yeah, it happens, it happens, there's a lot of big conventions, Memorial Day weekend.
5597600	5601360	Alright, well, um, we gotta let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for the report, and, uh,
5601360	5603040	glad to hear you enjoyed your first con.
5603040	5605280	Yeah, thanks a lot, Rob.
5605280	5606280	No problem.
5606280	5609200	Maybe I'll see you at PAX Boston, speaking of which, since it sounds like this is your
5609200	5610200	neck of the woods.
5610200	5614680	I'll see what I can do, uh, I have to, I, I'll have to work things out, but we'll, we'll
5614680	5615680	meet someday.
5615680	5616680	Alright, someday.
5616680	5617680	I'll see you later.
5617680	5618680	Alright, take care, buddy.
5618680	5619680	Someday, Gadget.
5619680	5620680	Bye.
5620680	5622440	I'll get you next time, Gadget.
5622440	5623440	Next time.
5623440	5624440	Um, why not?
5624440	5626920	We'll do one more call if it comes in pretty soon here on the phones.
5626920	5628040	How you doing over there, Doc Soccer?
5628040	5629040	You've...
5629040	5630840	I'm doing fine, I'm actually checking for video game sims.
5630840	5631840	Oh, yeah?
5631840	5636600	I found one of, uh, Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 4, so that's a pretty good one.
5636600	5637600	That's fun.
5637600	5640160	You know, I still have yet to play Resident Evil 5, what the hell's wrong with me?
5640160	5642800	But, outside, outside of the demo.
5642800	5647200	Alright, well, our phones, sadly, are not really ringing right now, so we're gonna go
5647200	5648200	ahead and close up the lines.
5648200	5649200	Dammit, call!
5649200	5650200	Nah, it's too late, I closed up the lines.
5650200	5654160	We're at about an hour and a half now, anyway, and I wanna go run out and get some food and,
5654160	5657680	and enjoy the rest of my Memorial Day weekend, as I'm sure a lot of you folks do.
5657680	5660680	So we're gonna go ahead and go around and start to wrap things up, and get on out of
5660680	5661680	here for the evening.
5661680	5662680	So, um...
5662680	5663680	In ribbons and bows?
5663680	5664680	If we want to.
5664680	5666040	Uh, we'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
5666040	5669500	I guess we'll start with me tonight, although I don't have much of a final thought tonight.
5669500	5671160	My final thought is...
5671160	5672160	Yogurt.
5672160	5673160	I want yogurt.
5673160	5674160	I want some too!
5674160	5676800	That would be amazing right now, would be some yogurt.
5676800	5678480	That would be fant- fantastical.
5678480	5679480	Not fro-gurt.
5679480	5680480	But yogurt.
5680480	5684320	Cause the fro-gurt has potassium benzoate.
5684320	5685320	Never mind.
5685320	5686320	Uh...
5686320	5687920	Dark Sakura, what's your final thought tonight?
5687920	5688920	Um...
5688920	5689920	Porn.
5689920	5692480	There you go, it ended how it began.
5692480	5696760	Hey, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us tonight and supporting Independent Podcasting.
5696760	5701440	Loki should be back next week, as will I, as will Dark Sakura, for our big pre-E3 show.
5701440	5704920	I know you've probably heard E3 talked about to death on other shows, but we are gonna
5704920	5709000	be taking your last request for what you want to see us cover at E3, and all of that we'll
5709000	5712240	be doing next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5712240	5716800	If- again, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about the program, help
5716800	5720480	spread the good word about the show, help offset those a-holes that leave negative reviews
5720480	5724100	on websites because they have nothing better to do with their sorry-ass lives, uh, because
5724100	5728920	it really helps, you know, us have the motivation to keep going when you guys, uh, say good
5728920	5732800	things about us and- and just knowing we have certain people that would be here every week.
5732800	5733800	You know-
5733800	5735480	I also like when you send me money.
5735480	5739440	Although sometimes it can be frustrating when people bitch and moan and bellyache when you
5739440	5744900	go a week without a show, or that the podcast was late or whatever, it does show that people
5744900	5749800	care enough to complain, so I actually kind of see the good in that, and thanks everybody
5749800	5754080	for your passion around the show, it- it- that is very motivating, surprisingly enough.
5754080	5756480	So keep us on our toes, I guess is what I'm saying.
5756480	5757480	Twinkle toes!
5757480	5758480	There you go.
5758480	5759480	Alright, that's it.
5759480	5760480	We're out of here.
5760480	5763840	Have a great night everybody, and uh, tune in next week, we'll be back with more of Orange
5763840	5764840	Lounge Radio.
5764840	5765840	Have a great night.
