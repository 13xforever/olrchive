14124	19810	Tonight, May 24th, 2009, an OLR favor game is getting remade on the DS and Wii.
20030	23234	Did Sony confirm the smaller PS3 with their lawsuits?
23534	25836	Will I soon be able to rent games on my PSP?
31667	36368	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36428	42229	We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42969	49050	And joining you every week is myself, Rob Roberts, and my awesome co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49370	49890	Porn!
50150	50770	How are you doing?
50970	51290	Porn.
52131	53351	No, I just wanted to say porn.
53471	54391	Is the internet for porn?
54491	56651	I wanted the first word that I said on the show tonight to be porn.
56671	57992	Alright, well there you go, it was.
58052	60212	Second word of the show, official word of the show.
60532	60812	Yes?
60952	61373	Tribble.
61833	64095	Alright, so are you into Tribble porn or something?
64135	67799	No, I went to see Star Trek again for the third time in the theater.
68099	72583	And then we went back to Becky's house and watched Tribble with Tribbles and then Trial and Tribblations.
72863	74465	Did you see the new HD?
74485	77387	Because apparently they remade a bunch of Star Trek episodes in HD.
77448	84414	I have to tell you, everyone who goes to see the movie or goes to see it again, when they first show Scotty, look on his desk, there's a Tribble.
84932	85152	Nice.
85753	86554	OMG spoilers.
86754	87194	I'm just kidding.
87875	89177	Okay, like the Tribble.
89757	92240	Oh, and the way they defeat the guy is Tribbles.
94362	97345	So since you brought up porn, what would you say is your favorite porn?
101750	102311	The Boneheads.
102771	103572	The Boneheads.
105674	106154	Ali McFeel Bible Black
126403	128044	Sorry, that's kind of cool.
128324	128845	It's all good.
128925	140272	Hey, look in the chat, chat.orangelonestradio.com is always there when, you know, every night, every week that we tape this show, you guys are always there to entertain us with your chat comments.
140292	144995	And we have Tiger Claw says, Sky, the classic Star Trek series in HD is now available in Blu-ray.
145595	147517	And yeah, I've heard about that.
147577	149538	Plus all the old movies are available in Blu-ray too.
149958	152860	But wake me when they have the next generation movies in Blu-ray.
152900	153901	I love the Mesa Suma.
154321	156422	Triple porn aren't triples born pregnant.
157002	160423	By the way, if you pluralize something, do not use an apostrophe.
161544	161784	Nice.
161924	166506	One Night Stands in chat says, I just saw a porno called Six Fags Magic Mount Him.
167746	169007	I want to see that.
169047	169667	That sounds funny.
169727	170647	See, those are my favorite ones.
170667	172288	The ones that are based off of actual movies.
172308	173888	And no, Final Fuck X was crap.
174549	176309	Good cosplay, really crappy porn.
176389	178130	We talk about games sometimes on this show.
178830	180251	But you're probably wondering, where's Loki?
180271	180991	You haven't heard him yet.
181571	183632	We gagged him with duct tape and tape.
183732	184672	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
212822	214303	It's not a drunk show though, it's a beer show
237876	238877	DarkSakura is drinking beer.
239077	241677	I, however, due to everything I went through last year, I'm not drinking.
241817	242298	I have vodka.
242538	243278	I have vodka.
243638	243998	I can't.
244578	246259	Yeah, just alcohol in general is a bad idea.
246579	247459	I have some rubbing alcohol.
247679	248899	I have wine once in a while.
249260	250080	I have wine once in a while.
250400	250900	I don't want wine.
251140	251740	I have witch hazel.
252100	252941	I got to be sober tonight.
252981	255621	I got to set a good example for the kids since you're setting a bad one.
255701	256462	I have peroxide.
256782	257282	All right, look.
259243	260583	Shut up and tell us about your gaming week.
261483	262183	I played Sims.
263244	263844	That's about it.
264482	265623	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
286684	287865	I've been enjoying porn and sims.
288665	293307	I've actually found a bunch of naughty items that I just was curious to see how they worked so I downloaded them just to see.
294147	295088	They're really horrible.
296268	299770	Why do you think people go instantly to doing dirty porno things?
300470	306873	It goes back to the first things that you learn in any language is how to cuss and how to talk about sex.
308564	309385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
328447	336673	The Sims Body Shop thing, where you can, you know, if you download different skins and everything, you can make your own Sims look pretty cool.
337073	347020	Like, I showed Rob one that I made of a couple of characters I used to have, and I've even done one for, you know, quite a number of my old tabletop game characters are pretty cool.
348861	349521	I did one of me.
349822	351463	I'm going to do one of Rob, just because it's funny.
352099	352459	Rob Sim Rob Sim
369113	373875	The last one I built, though, is pretty damn cool, and I love it, and I would actually live in that house if I could.
374575	384779	So, I've been, you know, sort of letting out an artistic thing, you know, something that's been lagging, you know, while I've been in school.
385139	387860	I guess my artsy stuff has been focused toward...
388320	391822	My assignments towards this theme, that theme, getting this done, getting that done.
392002	396545	And I've really just sort of enjoyed having kind of a point-and-click kind of artistry lately.
397065	399587	You know, where I don't have to really use my brain so much.
399647	401408	I can just pick things as I want to.
401988	402549	It's been pretty cool.
403049	405691	You might need to play some Ragnarok this week, because I'm thinking about signing up.
406471	406831	Really?
407292	408833	I haven't played Ragnarok in about a month now.
408893	410053	Wait a minute.
410093	412595	This is the same girl who every week is like, oh, you should sign up on my server.
412615	413816	You should sign up and play some Ragnarok.
414696	416137	If you sign up and play with me, I'll play.
416337	417738	Alright, because I might do that.
418539	423402	Transitioning into my gaming week, I was playing a little bit of World of Warcraft this week, of course, as usual, but...
424636	426897	There's theatrics going on.
426917	427538	We'll leave it at that.
427578	428258	There's theatrics.
428298	430099	It's just kind of making me go, whatever.
430259	432000	I mean, I play games for fun.
432321	434242	I don't know why everybody else can't do the same thing.
434682	440065	But, yeah, so I'm thinking about just chilling out in another game for a little while while I can.
440646	444548	Because life's going to get very busy with, you know, in a couple weeks being E3 and everything going on.
444908	449511	So, you know, now's a good time to sell me on other MMOs if you want to get me to check it out.
449591	451953	Even part of me was like, I should go back and check out Final Fantasy XI.
451973	452513	But then I was like...
452933	454094	No, that's really a bad idea.
455135	456155	That's a bad idea, Rob.
470355	485340	Other games in my gaming week You know, I haven't actually played an awful lot I know, it's kind of like, it's affecting both Jamie and I But I did fire up the 360 earlier this week And was still playing some Space Invaders Extreme And I finally bought Outrun Because I checked out the demo like a while back But I finally actually had some time to sit down
485640	486220	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
509293	510535	I need to play more of the multiplayer though.
510555	519625	I only really checked out single player this week and was trying to beat it and would come so close and can't seem to beat it because I suck at video games.
520266	520727	No, I don't know.
520747	522909	I just didn't spend enough time with it.
522949	523269	I don't know.
523830	524871	But, yeah.
525805	531488	Otherwise, I've been watching some movies and just catching up on some other stuff around the house and other things going on in my personal life.
531809	534190	Tomorrow's going to be a big video gaming day, though.
534250	540934	I don't have a lot of other stuff planned, so my things to do are clean and play video games and to get in a bunch of things before E3.
541154	543336	I had a Twitter...
544196	572385	message asking me to check out Team Fortress 2 which I'm going to try to do tomorrow also I really need to get in and play more Left 4 Dead so I might make it a PC day tomorrow but I also want to go back and visit some of my Xbox 360 RPGs like I don't know why I have this real itch to go back and do Lost Odyssey because I only really got through like maybe the first third or the first half and I really want to go and finish that so we'll see so yeah that's my plans for this upcoming week
573223	573823	How about you guys?
573903	575004	Did you guys have a good gaming week?
575044	575825	I'm looking at chat room.
576405	580407	Cheeseburger says, I saw Star Trek twice already and I'm going to see it again.
581908	582628	I got you beat.
582869	587091	Unfolded Raptor says, I've been playing Bionic Commando all day and I'm already 63% done.
587351	588712	I'm kind of curious how fun that is.
589112	592974	I've been hearing some mixed things on it, so I'm kind of curious what our chatters think of that.
593375	594675	Certainly I like the old school one.
595236	597237	And I like the redone old school one.
597257	599858	That was a real fun one on Xbox Live Arcade.
600459	600579	Um...
603256	605197	GameGuru asks when is E3?
605577	630305	E3 is not this upcoming week like tomorrow but it's a week after like it starts a week from Tuesday June 2nd is when it starts and I'll be going down there Monday night so we're still going to have shows actually through E3 week because DarkSakura is not going I do not believe we're going to be doing anything live from E3 but stay tuned to the Twitter and to the website you never know what surprise we might have cooked up I am going to take my video camera
630785	640275	But as I was telling Bobby earlier, Bobby Blackwolf, who's before us here on Sunday nights on All Games Radio, I don't think there's a lot we can do that all the big websites aren't already going to do.
640655	642477	We're not going to be the first to report on the news.
642517	643498	We rarely are.
645220	649344	We're not going to really be on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest E3 news.
649644	650645	But what we can do...
651606	653568	Hey, you guys have been reading what's going on at E3.
653909	655930	What do you want us to dig and find?
655991	657452	We're your reporters on the show.
657772	659534	We're the show where every gamer has a voice.
659574	660655	What do you want us to find?
661015	666721	So we'll be definitely using Twitter and the website and some other things to find out what you guys want us to dig up at E3.
666781	671645	So look for that and our reports, be it in video form or other tweets or what have you.
672426	673187	So we'll be looking at that.
674721	675161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
694918	698981	And I'm sure the person listens to this show because it seemed like the kind of thing where it's just to get a rise out of us.
699361	701042	It's like, dude, we do this stuff for free.
701122	703984	And it's like reading stuff like that is really disheartening.
704664	706906	Leave five-star reviews for the shows you like.
707446	710788	But what good is it to leave a one-star review for these other shows and people that work hard?
711148	712709	Unless they're really crap.
714230	716031	I would like to think we're not really crap.
716252	716772	You know what, Rob?
717492	719454	Honestly, I don't care.
720453	723698	I don't, but it sucks because that, and I blame Apple.
723978	728785	It affects your ranking on the whole if you go in and look at the lineups of the shows in there.
729005	731148	We were on page one and now we dropped to page three.
731429	732931	That's kind of disappointing.
733451	734913	That's the only thing that bugs me about it.
734974	735755	Otherwise, I don't care.
737093	737874	We'll elaborate it.
737894	738134	I'm kidding.
738214	739536	How about some gaming news, shall we?
739556	739656	About.
754373	754893	All right.
755294	757655	Hey, kind of a follow-up to something we were talking about last week.
757915	758515	3D Realms.
758595	763257	And we were talking about how 3D Realms went under, quote-unquote, and took Duke Nukem Forever with it.
763657	773381	Well, this is interesting because apparently 3D Realms actually released a public statement this week after the whole development team was dissolved that was working on Duke Nukem Forever.
773921	777163	And they said they are not closed and they are not closing.
777683	786777	However, they are saying that Take-Two will be retaining the publishing rights to Duke Nukem forever, and they will be able to sell the game directly to the public.
787702	788382	Thank you for watching!
808595	809696	I don't know.
809716	815260	I feel like there's two sides to every story, and I still can't help but think, guys, what were you producing on this game?
815720	820103	There was not a lot of public buzz going on because they refused to release screenshots.
820423	821544	There was no demo.
821944	823585	They hadn't shown at E3 for years.
823926	825487	What did they expect was going to happen?
825807	831110	I mean, as much as I was excited for Duke Nukem Forever, like the last guy, tease us a little bit with something.
831731	837915	And I understand, Take-Two probably had the open book, and they got to see everything that was going on, but still, I mean, it's a business.
838595	867692	and if people aren't it's tough to sell a game in this day and age with you know look at Prey and how kind of disappointing that ended up being sales wise you know if there's not the buzz out there for the game it's not going to be pretty and I bet you anything now that Take-Two does have the rights to this we're going to see this game out in a year or two tops two years tops this game comes out well we can if it ever really does I mean honestly I sort of lost my expectation of it really coming out
868277	868878	I guess that's true.
868958	871961	And I even think at this point it might be a subpar game, but I don't know.
871981	873142	I'm not going to write it off completely.
874223	875544	Never write off a game until you play it.
875664	877086	That's what I'm planning to do.
877671	880553	Here's a game that some people might get to play if they have a Dreamcast.
881113	883695	It's coming out for Windows, Linux, and Dreamcast.
883755	883975	Yep.
884435	900225	It's a homebrew game called Hypertension, and it is a re-imaging of Blood, which uses the Doom-based Edge engine.
901525	906829	So yeah, it's kind of old school in that sense, but it's coming out on Dreamcast, so...
907509	908730	Hey, why not?
908770	910351	If you got it, buy it, I guess.
911371	920756	I'm looking a little bit at the play from it, and I'm really not impressed.
920796	922577	I mean, then again, it's old school.
922838	923658	It's Doom-like.
924819	925319	Is that not?
925699	926299	Well, I don't know.
926339	927740	It's got some 3D, I guess.
928200	928881	It's not pixely.
930671	932992	It looks a little like, yeah, Doomish.
933012	933532	It's quakey.
934072	938193	Doomish meets, yeah, kind of in that vein, the early 90s, or I guess maybe the mid-90s.
938213	941173	But the weapon is aerosol and a lighter.
941393	941873	I love it.
942994	945774	But I mean, is there really a market for these types of Dreamcast games?
945794	946354	It's kind of funny.
946955	947275	I don't know.
947815	951596	Does everybody report on these games because it's like, OMG, new Dreamcast game.
951636	952996	Who would have thought?
953696	958597	I think it's notable, you know, that there's being homebrewed, you know.
959992	960672	That's about it.
961613	963094	People still love the Dreamcast, I guess.
963714	963975	I do.
965676	966056	I guess.
966616	970178	And one thing I did love about the Dreamcast is that there was so much homebrew available for it.
970218	972060	You know what I play most of all on my Dreamcast?
972860	973580	NES emulator.
974801	977003	I mean, honestly, that's one of the greatest things about it.
977143	979044	We busted out Marvel vs. Capcom 2 the other night.
979224	979444	Yeah?
979664	979824	Yeah.
980044	980525	Good times.
981665	983046	So you did do some gaming this week.
983587	984087	Oh, Dan did.
984467	984967	A little bit.
985268	986248	We is in my household.
986949	987189	Gotcha.
987209	987309	Yeah.
987915	988756	Thanks for watching!
1006167	1010209	Of course, Metroid Prime 3 was the only one that's been released on the Wii in this country.
1010309	1015131	However, Metroid Prime 1 and 2 were re-released over in Japan, kind of the whole new Wii controls.
1015171	1015711	Well, guess what?
1016012	1020194	Nintendo announced this week that the Metroid Prime Trilogy will be coming to the U.S.
1020694	1023575	And that means that Metroid Prime will be kind of repackaged.
1023595	1030758	The first two games will have the new Wii controls and the whole widescreen graphics, which, you know, I bet a lot of people have mixed feelings about.
1030778	1031819	But if you never really bought...
1032279	1035001	One or two, you know, this might be a good way to revisit those games.
1035621	1038503	The only bummer is, no news here about Metroid Prime 4.
1039644	1045648	You know, if you have Metroid Prime Trilogy, it kind of insinuates there may not be a Metroid Prime 4.
1046309	1051853	But I do have that hope that maybe that's one of the surprises they're going to pull out of E3, but I don't know, I wouldn't bet on it.
1052273	1052773	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1070845	1073928	I do too, and I think a lot of people want that, but I don't know.
1075309	1076751	Is it really something that might sell?
1077051	1080895	Or something we would get not on the DS?
1081195	1081696	You know what I mean?
1081936	1082957	Even more the Willa Blend.
1084161	1087302	I think if a new 2D Metroid is going to come out, it's going to just be on the DS.
1087682	1088802	And that's kind of the bummer about it.
1089483	1094104	Yeah, I like the DS and all, but I like to play the old school games on my TV as well.
1094124	1096405	The big surround sound.
1096565	1101586	Look at some of the games that are 2D, 3D hybrids that were on consoles that were pretty good.
1102367	1104367	Well, Street Fighter 4 is a perfect example, right?
1104987	1107788	2D fighter, awesome use of 3D in it.
1107988	1109949	Why couldn't you make a platformer in that kind of vein?
1110909	1111850	or a game going back a little bit.
1111870	1114611	Last we really got for platformers was, I think, LittleBigPlanet.
1115272	1116453	Oh, that's a great example.
1116513	1119514	I was going to say Beautiful Joe, even though that's back on the GameCube.
1119574	1122416	It's still a good example of 2D platformers.
1122436	1123417	And Shinagogo.
1123637	1124778	They can still be a lot of fun.
1124998	1125638	Yeah.
1126038	1130181	Well, if anything, I think that LittleBigPlanet proved that right away.
1131742	1135886	Rene says in chat, Metroid Prime 4, you lost your power-ups again, moron.
1136747	1137267	I guess that's true.
1137307	1140070	How many times can we go through the same story of, whoops, lost my power-ups.
1140110	1142332	Maybe we can use dumb blonde as an excuse, I don't know.
1142372	1143373	Yeah, just make it a prequel.
1143433	1144293	Make it another prequel.
1144954	1148157	TigerClaw says the next one will be called Metroid Prime 4, Electric Boogaloo.
1148677	1149138	One can hope.
1149298	1151460	That would only be if, that was what they should have called Metroid Prime 2.
1152360	1155743	Brad from PodCulture says, Metroid Prime 4, Mission to Moscow.
1156363	1156703	Who knows?
1157404	1162467	If you want to join us and chat live on this Sunday evening, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1163328	1166490	Well, this is something that I am going to have to get.
1166670	1168751	This is on my must-buy Wii list.
1170412	1179297	They're doing a haunted house simulator, and it is going to be Ju-on, which is The Grudge.
1180217	1183339	Yes, as in the same movie, and probably not including Sarah Michelle Gellar.
1184559	1186780	It already came out in Japan a few weeks ago.
1187060	1189940	It will be localized hopefully pre-Halloween.
1190621	1192221	So hopefully we'll be able to see it.
1192261	1205964	But it's actually being consulted on it is Shimizu Takashi who was the guy who directed actually not only the Japanese version but he directed the first American one.
1205984	1207485	The second one is utter shit.
1207605	1208145	Don't go see it.
1210314	1236268	but it's basically you're using the Wiimote as a flashlight on screen and you go through a warehouse a mannequin factory a hospital just basically all your usual oh my god I'm scared places but it's supposed to have a twist where you can use your second Wiimote to make in game things happen immediately
1237248	1246777	In fact, the actual quote from this article, and I have to read this Rob, is to make in-game events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.
1248174	1248634	I like that.
1248714	1252275	And there's a YouTube they're promoting this with that just shows a bunch of scared people.
1252555	1255216	Hey, I'm all for scary games that are going to make me jump out of my seat.
1255316	1255876	I don't know, though.
1255916	1257297	The Grudge, you know.
1257337	1257797	I'm on it.
1258057	1259618	The first movie was cool, but.
1259698	1261718	I've seen the second one, the Japanese movie.
1261738	1264379	I've seen the TV movie.
1265039	1268420	Jeff and I were renting movies the other night, and I saw The Grudge 3 on DVD.
1268700	1270761	And I looked at that, and I was like, lol, there's a third one.
1271434	1272374	Was it American?
1272514	1273795	Yeah, it was American Grudge 3.
1273915	1274315	No.
1274455	1274755	Yes.
1275595	1276015	No.
1276495	1276815	Yes.
1277115	1277536	No.
1278236	1279216	It said The Grudge 3.
1279256	1283597	I don't know if it was maybe the Japanese one being marketed as an American one.
1283637	1284437	I don't know, but it was there.
1284937	1285238	No.
1285778	1286598	I crap you not.
1287738	1294200	The second one's funny because it's about What's-Her-Face doing dirty things with the main character.
1294240	1294720	It's pretty funny.
1295310	1296170	Not dirty that way.
1296231	1298252	She's... It's very interesting.
1298572	1299352	It's very interesting.
1299392	1301493	Yeah, 2009, direct-to-video.
1302454	1302994	It came out.
1303354	1304235	That is shit.
1304375	1308077	Stars Shawnee Smith from the Saw series is in it.
1308497	1309097	Oh, whatever.
1309277	1309738	There it is.
1310814	1312535	The Grudge 3, I don't know when this came out.
1312575	1315056	It came out 12th of May, so it just came out.
1315076	1316477	It doesn't exist in my universe.
1317938	1318778	Do you want to hear the plot?
1319499	1319699	No.
1319799	1330445	A young Japanese woman who holds the key to stopping the evil spirit of Kayako travels to the haunted Chicago apartment from the sequel... I'm not going to read the rest, because you didn't really want to hear it anyway.
1330965	1333146	I just wanted to see if you recognized it from any of the Japanese ones.
1335867	1336088	No.
1336488	1338449	Ghosts don't move from Japan to Chicago.
1340464	1340824	No.
1341265	1342766	All they have to do is just hop on an airplane.
1343407	1344007	No.
1345949	1352996	That's someone who completely just knows crap about, you know, hauntings and anything.
1353116	1354337	They usually stay localized.
1356129	1360353	TigerClaw in chat says they tend to milk those movies by creating crappy direct-to-DVD sequels.
1360393	1361154	Yeah, that's true.
1362335	1365838	You know, there's a sequel to Donnie Darko that just came out too that was direct-to-video.
1365858	1366559	I haven't watched that yet either.
1366579	1367460	Actually, that I want to see.
1368240	1371643	It's been actually in writing and production for quite a while now.
1372344	1373065	and I really want to see it.
1373145	1378549	Well, Jeff rented that and he wanted to watch it but I was kind of like, I don't remember the first one well enough.
1378569	1383372	I haven't seen the first one in like 10 years because seriously, they're making a sequel to a movie that's like 10 years old.
1383833	1386114	So, I need to just go watch the first one.
1386134	1387075	Here's my copy right here.
1387215	1387455	Really?
1387716	1388736	I have the director's edition.
1388856	1390418	Yeah, I need to watch it at some point.
1390438	1397403	Donnie Darko is a fantastic movie and plus, you know, any movie that Drew Barrymore is going to produce and I love Drew Barrymore.
1398263	1400585	She would be like my secret girlfriend if I could.
1400805	1401025	Yeah.
1401326	1401506	So...
1403206	1404627	I feel like slitting my wrist now.
1404767	1407348	I'm bleeding my pain on your face.
1431496	1433217	That was so gothic and tragic.
1457230	1457430	Quote,
1471900	1478503	eBay is actually pulling the auctions on this and Amazon got a notice and takedown and all this fun stuff.
1479583	1488886	Good luck though getting all those mom and pop stores that still sell this but still puts a little dent in it and makes it a little bit harder to get if you are looking for these cartridges.
1490990	1493272	Rini, though, in chat says, Flashcards are a waste of money.
1493332	1495253	Hi there, SD card slot on DSi.
1496214	1498876	Goldanthro admits that Amazon is where he got his R4.
1499336	1499657	I don't know.
1499717	1502138	I'm not into the hacking thing like a lot of y'all are.
1502359	1505861	I don't really have the patience for that stuff, so I don't really do it.
1506702	1510204	But I know this is probably a loss to those that were looking forward to the homebrew.
1510725	1515849	If you were using it for piracy, though, well, then, you know, it's hard to feel a little pity for you.
1516189	1519771	But at least the homebrew, as far as all that goes, that is kind of a bummer.
1521348	1523897	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
1524775	1530639	Well, in other news, we have some Sega stuff that makes me particularly happy.
1531740	1537483	Going to be coming out for DS and Wii is Jumbo Safari, actually.
1539145	1549712	They are taking the old arcade title and making it pretty and more modern looking and having more stuff happen to make people happy.
1555195	1571390	Animals in Need The DS version of course will work with the stylus and the Wii version will have a lasso gameplay that uses the Wiimote and you can have a 2 player and 4 player party version so there will be more
1573106	1575307	OLR has friends in high places
1595991	1600297	But, you know, Sega's got a pretty good track record otherwise, so I'm really excited about Jumbo Safari.
1600317	1601439	I don't know about you, DarkSakura.
1601479	1602521	Are you looking forward to this?
1603542	1604524	Yeah, pretty much.
1604884	1605645	I like to play the game.
1605966	1607608	I still want my freaking Planet Harrier.
1608049	1608870	Do you hear me, Sega?
1608890	1609951	Whores.
1610392	1610953	I mean, I love you.
1613155	1614516	I'm trying not to speculate on... Bring me swag!
1614556	1615037	That'll be worthwhile.
1629488	1632331	Jake Hunter Detective Story, Memories of the Past
1651551	1666804	Johnny Bravo, Datorama, a couple games with the preface of Crazy Chicken, including Star Carts, Pharaoh's Treasure, Imagine Boutique Owner comes out this week as well, as well as Space Camp, which I thought I remembered Loki reading a couple weeks ago, so I don't know if this game was pushed back or what.
1667245	1672289	Sadly, no, it is not based on the great 80s movie with the same name, so don't get your hopes up.
1672729	1676272	And Personal Trainer Walking, also on the DS this week.
1677433	1678394	LOL what?
1678534	1680917	Learn how to walk this week.
1681157	1681998	LOL what?
1683379	1691067	On the PC, Hinterland, Orc Lords, Age of Pirate 2, City of Abandoned Ships, Dragon Sky, Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper.
1691328	1692148	Ooh, that might be kind of fun.
1692629	1695252	Damnation is another game that comes out on the PC this week.
1695312	1699416	Moving on to the consoles, one release on PS2 this week, it's Secret Agent Clank.
1699776	1720983	and on the PlayStation 3 you also get Damnation, Infamous, Cross Edge, Trash Panic on the PSP Crimson Gems Saga and on the Wii another version of Space Camp and the Munchables and on the Xbox 360 Damnation as well as Wallace and Gromit 2, Wallace and Gromit Episode 2 The Last Resort which I believe is a Xbox Live game.
1722099	1723640	That is all that's coming out in the U.S.
1723660	1723981	this week.
1724001	1725602	Let's travel over to the U.K., DarkSakura.
1725722	1726323	For the U.K.
1726383	1728405	on PS2, we have Secret Agent Clank.
1729105	1735391	28th, we have Inferno Pool and Saints Row 2 Corporate Warfare and Trash Panic, whatever that is.
1736092	1742818	We have R. Tonelico, Two Melody of Metafalca, I guess.
1743038	1745460	If I can, Falisa, I guess.
1745620	1746161	I can't read it.
1746721	1747381	My brain doesn't work.
1747561	1754123	Is trash panic what my mother does when I leave a Coke can on the table because I forgot to throw it away or what have you or got lazy and just walked away?
1754403	1755183	That sounds like what it is.
1755584	1756084	Trash panic.
1756104	1756444	Don't worry.
1756504	1757204	Mama will clean it.
1757864	1758784	More on the 29th.
1758884	1760165	Boom Blox Bash Party.
1760265	1766547	Brain Exercise with Dr. Kalashima and Fuel and Virtua Tennis 2009.
1767027	1770968	PDC World Championship Darts and Valhalla Nights 2 on PSP.
1773154	1774515	Shinsengoku Musou 5 Empires
1790784	1800090	Coming out in other places, I'm sorry, coming out on other consoles in the same place, Infamous comes out in Asian regions, but it's not quite out in Japan this week.
1800811	1809537	However, Shinsengoku Musou 5 comes out as well on the PlayStation 3, and Agaresenki comes out with a price reduction this week, down to $44.90.
1811458	1815221	Also a game called The Last Guy comes out from Sony Computer themselves.
1816121	1817882	I am not sure, this is an action game.
1818823	1821846	I'm not sure what this is a port of, but it looks to be some type of shooter game.
1821866	1824388	But what's kind of cool about it, it looks like it uses Google Earth.
1825550	1828532	Seriously, doesn't the backgrounds here look like something you'd see in Google Earth?
1828993	1829794	Yeah, a bit.
1830014	1830554	That's pretty cool.
1831235	1832116	So that comes out this week.
1832416	1837701	And looking on other consoles, going over to the Nintendo Wii, just one released this week.
1838502	1843807	Ogon no Kizuna comes out this week, which is not a game I've heard of.
1845313	1854119	It looks kind of similar to a Dynasty Warriors-ish type of game, but with a little more role-playing elements mixed in, so check that out.
1854879	1859402	If you like, on the PlayStation 2, the Grand Theft Auto games get a price reduction this week.
1859422	1860723	That's something to look forward to in Japan.
1861124	1868408	On the Nintendo DS, Claymore, Gingan no Majo comes out this week, as well as Days of Memories 3 from SNK.
1869709	1872251	Gaia Kukuten Kenji comes out as well.
1872271	1874853	It has a Premium Edition release as well from Capcom.
1875773	1877354	That, oh, that's, you know what that is?
1877414	1879855	That's Ace Attorney Investigations, Miles Edgeworth.
1880095	1880615	You know what, Rob?
1880655	1883696	I do have to say that your Japanese is improving greatly.
1883997	1884957	At least the show's been good.
1885237	1886598	This show's been good for something, huh?
1886958	1888838	Yeah.
1888939	1895681	Also on the Nintendo DS, one more release for you from Sega, Suzumiya Haruhi no Shokuryetsu.
1895781	1897322	It's the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.
1898177	1900359	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1916713	1918394	Because Haruhi is God.
1919295	1919996	No, actually she is.
1920896	1921677	That's the premise of the story.
1921697	1922057	She's God.
1922417	1924239	Quickly looking at the PSP release dates.
1925560	1926580	Ghost in the Shell.
1927421	1928301	Oh, these are all movies.
1928702	1929863	I don't see any games this week.
1931844	1934406	Bamboo Blade is the only game it looks to be this week.
1934486	1935687	So check that out if you'd like.
1936834	1937134	There you go.
1937174	1938535	That's it for Japanese release dates.
1938795	1945760	Let's go back into some gaming news and talk about some music that's been licensed for an upcoming Q Entertainment game.
1945820	1946861	Kind of interesting about this.
1947261	1952865	Apparently, Tiesto and BT Songs have been licensed for this new game from Q Entertainment.
1953205	1961470	The game is called QJ based on some... I guess some folks have been digging around some of the licensing information sites.
1962931	1964052	The songs that were licensed.
1964613	1966234	Love Comes Again from Tiesto.
1967369	1967969	So there you go.
1969290	1972952	You know, I don't know much about this, but if it's Q Entertainment, then it's Mizuguchi.
1973052	1975073	And, you know, I love him.
1975293	1978215	There's very few games he's put out that I haven't liked.
1978335	1979976	And I'm even counting 99 Nights.
1980056	1984778	I forgave that game's shortcomings just because I'm a whore for Tetsuya Mizuguchi games.
1985218	1985779	So there you go.
1987359	1989020	More about this game hopefully at E3.
1989160	1989541	Hopefully.
1989601	1990101	Fingers crossed.
1991035	1994798	Killzone 2, Bullet 4D Interactive Ad, Red Faction, Guerrilla Multiplayer, and Infamous
2011671	2038158	PS3 game content Riddick, Dark Athena, Premium Multiplayer Pack We've got some more for Fear 2 Tom Clancy's Hawks, Pain Motorstorm Pacific Rift, Little Big Planet A bunch of stuff for Little Big Planet Guitar Hero World Tour, the European track Rock Band Alice Cooper Pack That's cool Rock Band Taking Back Sunday Kids Don't Follow by The Replacements For PSP games we have Fading Shadows and Creatures Raised in Space
2041553	2043094	Creatures raised in space.
2043895	2044355	Amazing.
2045716	2047118	I actually logged into Home this week.
2047158	2048979	That's one other game, quote-unquote, I played.
2049279	2051441	Boy, Home is really expanding.
2051541	2056765	Say what you will about whether Home is a game or any fun, all with quotes.
2057146	2060708	But they're sure pouring a lot of expansions into it, which I guess is kind of cool.
2060729	2063551	It seems like you have a lot of new stuff to explore if you haven't used it in a while.
2063631	2065773	So props to them for that.
2065793	2066233	There's a new...
2067654	2067994	Lord, no.
2094426	2096750	Yeah, I unfortunately would have to say no.
2097011	2098173	That's why she's in the kitchen.
2098333	2100036	She's always in the kitchen and never in the bedroom.
2100517	2100858	There you go.
2105014	2107535	Moving on with some more news, talking about Sony.
2108175	2115498	And, well, it looks like Sony is going to be threatening to sue companies that are publishing images of the PS3.
2115758	2117258	Remember we were talking about this last week?
2117618	2120139	We had some images leak out of the new PS3.
2120279	2124521	Well, apparently Sony has been demanding that these companies stop doing this.
2124641	2128042	And I know this all started from, I guess, like their Taiwanese branch or something.
2128362	2133084	But, dude, when you threaten to sue, doesn't it kind of prove that the story is true?
2133904	2137467	That was my first thought, is like, well, way to give it away, right?
2138347	2145292	I mean, otherwise, wouldn't they just release that good old-fashioned line of, oh, Sony will not comment on rumors and speculation at this time.
2145993	2147073	Look for our E3 speech.
2148474	2151657	But if you stick the lawyers on them, doesn't it kind of prove it to be true?
2152617	2153338	Maybe I'm crazy.
2155649	2159531	Well, how about some, I guess, happier news?
2161552	2168696	We are actually going to be getting some PlayStation 1 classic games for the PS1 Classic Store.
2170437	2175300	We have been getting information from the ESRB because you know how they love to leak stuff.
2176060	2180222	And five games are supposed to be coming to the online service.
2180423	2181003	We have...
2181643	2184965	Among them, Resident Evil Director's Cut and Metal Gear Solid.
2186606	2194111	Also among those rated is Special Ops Covert Assault and Ranger Elite and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six.
2194471	2195572	So that's pretty cool.
2196193	2205018	But dude, Metal Freakin' Gear and Resident Evil Director's Cut, I will have to go along with all the bad voice acting because I can quote that game, you know.
2206019	2206599	What is it?
2207180	2208841	I hope this is not Chris's blood.
2210542	2210702	So.
2211880	2217366	Maybe the hidden porn chat will be kind of embedded in the game somewhere.
2217386	2217946	Who knows?
2217966	2218527	Because remember that?
2218547	2221890	There's like YouTube out there where they mix and match all the dialogue into something disgusting.
2221910	2223992	I'm going to tell you this because I know how you can do it.
2224132	2224853	There was a...
2226916	2230800	A file reader that let you read the audio and video files off of PlayStation games.
2230840	2235604	Because, I don't know if you remember, back in the day, the first MP3s out for Bus to Move 2?
2236264	2237045	Sorry, I did those.
2238426	2239687	You know, on my old website.
2239867	2244411	I was the first person that I saw, that I noticed, that had them online, right after the game came out.
2245292	2245372	Um...
2247066	2273015	but there's a little reader program that you can get to rip the files off and then just record them, convert them to WAV or whatever and record them or whatever so that's actually how they pulled all this off there there's also how they got the thing about Maria in Castlevania where an ending that they didn't put into the game of her actually being taken over by the succubus so you can find out, it was a lot easier to find stuff
2273973	2274374	RedbookAudio.com
2293826	2295047	Right, but no, I'm saying after that.
2295087	2297588	We used to rip them by hooking them through the mixing board.
2298068	2299169	I'm surprised people didn't do that.
2299469	2311415	Yeah, you could still also pull them off doing the... It wasn't RA, it was like SX or SA reader or something.
2311755	2312235	I don't remember.
2312556	2313996	But yeah, I used to do that back in the day.
2314016	2315177	So it was really easy to do those.
2317138	2317278	Hmm.
2319068	2329420	All right, well, apparently there's a lot of rumbling going on about what's going on at E3 and possibly a new version of Metal Gear Solid apparently being rumored right now.
2329781	2333625	And a lot of this has to do with the teaser graphic that showed up on Kojima Productions' website.
2336687	2337067	I saw that too
2359805	2363167	I'm surprised if this is Metal Gear Solid 5 because it seems kind of soon.
2363387	2363988	Is it just me?
2364468	2366929	Or does it seem like 4 hasn't really been out long enough?
2367790	2368330	Am I crazy?
2369751	2370071	I don't know.
2371852	2383239	But you know, between the magazine, Famitsu Magazine, E3 coming up next week with this countdown seems to be pointing to, and all this, I mean, if there's a time to make a big announcement, I suppose this would be it.
2384835	2387477	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2407961	2408422	I don't know.
2408682	2409063	I don't know.
2409083	2413328	Because you know how while the market is, you know, struck while the iron's hot, pretty much.
2415170	2417533	I really don't want to put any speculation on it.
2417573	2418114	I really don't.
2418635	2423281	Because I build myself way too much up to be too excited about something.
2423381	2425924	I want to wait for something a little bit more concrete before I make my judgment.
2426520	2433003	Comment from your chat room, chat.orange-radio.com Actdeft says, the countdown is a countdown for a countdown for a countdown for a countdown.
2433263	2434823	Yeah, I'm getting kind of sick of that crap too.
2434843	2436024	You know what I mean?
2436064	2436664	Just announce it.
2436784	2437645	Announce it or don't.
2439005	2442046	One countdown to a big announcement might be okay.
2442326	2444347	But counting down to another countdown is stupid.
2445648	2446228	Very stupid.
2448574	2452455	One Night Stands in chat says, was the five outlined a definite five or could it have been an S?
2452935	2454035	Very good comment.
2454055	2459137	Some people are speculating it might have been an S. So maybe it's a new like Metal Gear Solid S type game or something.
2460097	2461117	Let me look at it for a second.
2461137	2462957	Let me look at it.
2463918	2468319	It was kind of like, well, it's one of those like fonts where it's very like pixelated.
2468859	2470939	So it could be a five or an S. Very easy.
2471339	2473400	Well, let me have a look if it loads.
2475271	2476873	It's not loading.
2477173	2477574	Trust me.
2477754	2478495	It could be either one.
2480738	2481119	Let's see.
2482761	2483402	Other comments.
2484323	2487427	Alpha Cananogram in chat says it's just an announcement, which is true.
2487487	2488268	It's only an announcement.
2488308	2489810	It's not something we should get too excited about.
2491652	2491913	There you go.
2493820	2496761	Well, how about something that might be worth getting excited about?
2496961	2500502	I mean, if you don't have iTunes or an iPhone, I guess.
2502182	2505503	PSP may be having a music download service.
2506383	2507703	Sony's been thinking about it.
2508243	2511764	They released a survey in January to check for consumer interest.
2511904	2514845	So, it seems that they are considering on...
2515586	2519231	and having other recording companies work with them.
2519291	2524760	And Sony, they have their own music division, but they're just thinking about it right now.
2525742	2529027	So they might have a digital music download, but maybe not.
2530470	2531051	It might happen.
2531231	2532291	They're thinking about it.
2532412	2535714	They're sending their little slimy tentacles out to feel for it.
2535814	2538716	I'm kind of surprised it's one of those things they haven't been thinking about for quite some time.
2539017	2539537	You know what I mean?
2539717	2541038	I don't know.
2542319	2544261	Again, I use the whole college kid thing.
2544301	2545822	Who do PSPs sell best to?
2545922	2546642	College kids.
2547063	2551686	To replace iPods because they do everything else like games and the internet and all this.
2551726	2555689	So it kind of seems like one of those things that I'm surprised they didn't do this a long freaking time ago.
2556030	2558772	Especially when you consider the fact what else does Sony have?
2559412	2561575	A big music label, right?
2562516	2564398	So, why is this taking so long?
2564578	2571025	Seriously, Sony's got a big, you know, they're big stinky tentacle fingers in the music industry, so why not?
2572667	2576571	I just think, though, that they tend to behave a bit conservatively when they don't need to.
2577412	2578153	Have you noticed that?
2579628	2580529	I guess, a little bit.
2580770	2585879	They'll venture out into something that they think is innovative and new, but with something that they see as tried and true.
2586640	2589925	They're like, I don't wanna.
2589966	2590647	They're doing it.
2590667	2591188	I don't wanna.
2594507	2601192	Alpha Catanagram in chat says, Sky, they did, it was called Connect, the ATRAC Atarak 3 store, which closed down.
2601772	2602953	They were planning on doing it.
2603073	2603813	Hmm, interesting.
2604054	2604814	I don't remember that.
2604874	2607096	Was that something for just the PSP specifically?
2607516	2608877	Or was that something to, you know...
2609737	2612899	There were like a million people that were going to launch something to compete with iTunes.
2613399	2614860	And very few of them succeeded.
2615280	2618822	I mean, you could say that Napster somewhat succeeded because it's a different business model.
2619102	2624725	And I think the biggest competition for iTunes has probably been, what, Amazon.com maybe?
2625205	2629227	But, I mean, what else is out there that's successfully competed with iTunes?
2629667	2634409	And when I say successfully, carries a market share even one-tenth the size of what Apple has.
2634670	2634830	No.
2634970	2635290	No one.
2635530	2637311	It's practically a monopoly on Apple's part.
2637984	2640205	Yeah, and that's what they're kind of saying there in chat.
2640225	2646049	So is this something new that maybe is trying to launch, and Alpha Caninogram confirms, connect with Sony's iTunes.
2646089	2650972	Okay, well, a million people tried to launch something to compete with iTunes, and they all failed because none of them stood out.
2651352	2657435	It was too much competition amongst each other, and iTunes already had the player to go with the store.
2660086	2663748	But also, oh, I want to read this comment from Marissa Congusto in chat.
2664688	2665208	Yes, that's right.
2665228	2665608	It's Marissa.
2666109	2670510	My dad thought he was doing me a big favor getting me a mini-disc player instead of an iPod ages ago.
2670670	2671251	Face palm.
2671871	2672291	That's all right.
2672311	2672671	I feel your pain.
2672691	2673572	I want a mini-disc player.
2673892	2675132	I have an HD DVD player.
2675452	2679074	So do I. I actually want a mini-disc player pretty badly.
2679494	2680855	They do some good things with mini-discs.
2680895	2681135	Really?
2681655	2684576	It's still, I think, somewhat supported in Japan.
2684916	2685157	Huh.
2685837	2685937	Weird.
2685957	2686077	Weird.
2686924	2690910	It's another example where Sony's tried to go, we're going to do all this new stuff.
2690970	2691952	I mean, Betamax.
2692613	2693594	Betamax was better.
2694436	2695497	Minidisc was great.
2696319	2699564	But the first thing that they've done in a long time that really caught on, I think that was Blu-ray.
2700794	2703937	OneNightStands in chat asks, wasn't Zune a competitor for iTunes?
2704317	2718208	Zune was a competitor for the iPod, and certainly Microsoft launched their own store to go with it, but it didn't really go... One could argue with me whether it was successful or not, but I think it's pretty clear iTunes has by far the most dominant share.
2718588	2719069	You know what I mean?
2719509	2721771	It hasn't really put a blip on the radar of what iTunes has.
2722211	2725534	So whether they're still supporting that whole Microsoft marketplace or what, I don't know.
2726635	2727075	But we'll see.
2728096	2730238	Well, how about some happy, happy, happy news?
2731115	2734197	And just a moment, let me talk about this PSP rental service here real quick.
2734637	2749263	There was a PSP survey that was hinting that a rental service might be on its way to the PSP, which is kind of interesting because we know that the PSP, you know, there's this new PSP coming out that nobody's confirming, but we all know it's probably happening.
2749303	2751284	It's going to be announced at E3 this year.
2751964	2753625	That's a diskless PSP.
2754955	2755776	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2773601	2789549	VideoGaming, where instead of a company boohooing and yelling and bitching and screaming about blockbusters and Hollywood videos and places that rent video games and how they chip into game sales, a company deciding to, well, hell, we'll do game rentals of our own.
2790509	2791590	If you can't beat them, join them.
2792310	2793471	And we'll compete with them directly.
2794827	2795487	Very interesting.
2795888	2799910	If this actually happens, that could be kind of interesting.
2799950	2800631	I mean, why not?
2801191	2804053	Apple has proved that it can happen with the movies on iTunes.
2804573	2807835	Why not rent games through a similar service?
2807875	2809196	This could be big if it's true.
2809596	2814439	You know, it's all kind of a big grain of salt right now because a survey isn't the official word, but it could be very interesting.
2815319	2815900	Well, it could be.
2817481	2817761	All right.
2818922	2819462	That's all I have.
2819682	2821403	Well, I did have my happy news.
2822324	2822544	Sure.
2823286	2824988	It has been confirmed!
2825068	2827651	We are getting Tatsunoko vs. Capcom in the U.S.
2829193	2832416	The Nintendo Power Scan was true.
2833137	2840726	And Capcom said on their Twitter that Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is being localized for a U.S.
2840806	2841166	release.
2841747	2844210	Well, U.S., Canada, North America, whatever.
2846969	2864237	and the quote says Cat is officially out of the bag on Capcom Mystery Game number one and linked to the scan and then there was also one made by Capcom Unity on their blog but there's one more mystery game they should be having at E3 so I hope it doesn't suck
2865547	2868408	and Renie in chat is yelling out with online and bug fixes.
2868508	2869628	God, I hope that's true.
2870088	2870408	Why not?
2870848	2872889	Especially if it's true they have to cut back a few characters.
2872949	2874449	Well, then, hell, let's make it better.
2874669	2877129	But the characters that were listed on there aren't even in the damn game anyway.
2878390	2879150	Oh, yeah.
2879170	2882571	We had some back and forth last week on whether those characters were really going to be there or not.
2882591	2887012	The only Gatchaman characters that were in the game is Ken and June.
2887412	2888152	Joe wasn't in it.
2888212	2891773	If Joe was in it, I'd be screaming because I'd want him in the release.
2892533	2892673	So...
2896414	2910832	Rini in chat says Sky, Mystery Game number 2 is Mega Man Legends 3 on Wii God, I hope you're If you're lying to me So help me God That would be amazing though if that's the Mystery Game I would love that But it seems like it's all speculation to me
2912233	2913374	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2937495	2938456	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2954294	2962421	Again, this is supposed to have a micro SD slot, SIM card tray, support for Bluetooth headphones in it, some optical digital output in there as well.
2962821	2969046	Apparently it will actually work with Zunex Originals, Xbox Live and OnLive ready game streaming.
2969306	2973950	There'll be a 32 gigabyte flash drive and the battery is built in and rechargeable.
2974290	2975291	And it will bake scones.
2976351	2977152	It just well might.
2978013	2978553	And run Linux.
2979134	2979774	So we'll see.
2979874	2981636	Maybe there will be more info about this at E3.
2982398	2985000	I dare whoever gets one of these to put Linux on it.
2985901	2987502	That'll make me go squee for a little bit.
2988463	2991365	Well, this is something that probably won't make people squee.
2991385	2994228	Although, to be completely honest, I don't think anyone will really freaking give a damn.
2995829	2998311	Watchmen, the end is nigh.
2998931	3001714	The second episode of it is not coming out for PC.
3002394	3003895	And a sad trombone, I guess.
3004456	3006097	It will come out on Xbox 360 and PS3 soon.
3008979	3018645	But, of course, it's also going to be selling a special edition that has this and the first episode on it.
3020106	3023949	Warner is doing The Watchmen, The End is Nigh, Complete Experience.
3023969	3028212	It has the PS3 versions and the director's cut of the film on Blu-ray.
3028552	3033435	So maybe that'll be worth buying because the movie was freaking good, but meh, the rest of it, meh.
3033455	3033815	Who cares?
3034475	3035036	Who cares?
3037153	3038314	I can fart better games.
3039396	3040718	Well, somebody out there might care.
3040738	3041119	You don't know.
3045681	3057387	Question in the chat room that I kind of like, and this is a very unpronounceable name, and I'm sorry, but RLBX327 asks, how would the new PSP work if a person does not have an internet connection?
3057447	3058247	How would that work?
3058947	3061729	That's a great question, one that we'd all like to know the answer to as well.
3061749	3063610	I'm hoping we'll get some results at E3.
3064010	3071614	I don't know if maybe you can take it into a game store and buy things that way, but I guess the assumption is everybody has an internet connection at this point.
3071634	3073134	It's like the DS download stations.
3073174	3074155	Could be something similar?
3074355	3074876	I guess?
3075476	3079700	I mean, there's definitely ways around it, but I think they just assume everybody has an internet connection.
3080261	3082383	And even dial-up, if you have to.
3082463	3083704	But who has dial-up anymore?
3084245	3087108	I guess, well, I shouldn't say that, because there'll be somebody that sends me a message.
3087168	3088009	Me, I have dial-up.
3088229	3089230	My parents have dial-up.
3089931	3094575	You know, but, jeez, my iPod 3G's faster than their internet at home on dial-up.
3095276	3120017	But I guess some areas still aren't wired for broadband But I guess you could still use a PSP Go on dial-up But maybe Sony is only marketing to those people that have internet connections I mean, let's face it, a vast portion of the population has an internet connection that's fast If every one of them bought a PSP Go, they would do very well So why bother catering to those that don't have an internet connection, right?
3122114	3123876	Well, this is the modern world.
3123916	3124957	Everyone's supposed to be connected.
3125577	3127459	SuperXLink in chat has an interesting comment.
3127679	3129000	Go to a free Wi-Fi spot.
3129481	3132383	Remember when... I think it was Nintendo did that at all the McDonald's?
3132804	3133945	The McDonald's or something like that?
3134345	3134825	I don't remember.
3136207	3140590	Anyhow, some more stories involving Capcom, actually, and talking about E3.
3141531	3142092	Thanks for watching!
3163215	3191544	Fully to attending the E3 They are still kind of contemplating What to do about the swine flu outbreak That's going on in Keihanshin, which is where Capcom's main office is in Japan Very interesting And what they're already saying is that because of this Dead Rising 2 is not going to be showing up at E3 Capcom has confirmed that Dead Rising 2 Not going to be there at E3 And this has to do with Japanese government restrictions And the advisory in Japan right now
3192461	3203388	By the way, doesn't just end there, Square, Koei, also not attending E3 from their Japanese branches because of apparently swine flu concerns.
3203948	3216356	A quote from an article on GamePolitics.com, quote, Square Enix has canceled plans for its Kingdom Hearts team to attend the show, whilst Koei has confirmed that an unspecified number of its Japanese employees will not be traveling to the event.
3217896	3218577	That's sad face.
3219850	3220751	Very, very sad.
3220791	3223194	And also incredibly freaking stupid.
3223354	3226097	It is incredibly stupid to still be concerned about the swine flu.
3226157	3226717	My God.
3227098	3228679	How many people contracted swine flu?
3228699	3229400	Like what, 800?
3229661	3230401	How many people died?
3230421	3230401	10?
3230662	3232584	Yeah, maybe 10 at most.
3232604	3235006	But there was a couple, granted there was a couple thousand that got swine flu.
3235286	3236868	But how many people get regular flu?
3237369	3237969	All the time.
3238470	3239231	Fucking shit.
3240044	3241584	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3262731	3271445	Seriously, I'm just... So the fact that stupid swine flu or H1N1 or whatever the fuck you want to call it is ruining E3.
3271645	3272166	Fuck people.
3272988	3274931	I say we dedicate the FUs of the week to this.
3290982	3297924	My FU of the week goes to just those stupid people who are willing to believe any and everything that they see on TV, on the internet.
3298244	3300365	You gullible, gullible fucking sheep.
3301805	3303205	I hope you get swine flu.
3303425	3304206	Just get it.
3304766	3307487	I hope you get swine flu of the colon.
3308527	3312228	And can do nothing but shit viruses or something.
3313587	3314508	That's what I wish.
3315690	3316751	I love you stupid people.
3316991	3317793	Wow.
3318353	3320917	And also, I want Dick Cheney to shut up.
3322819	3325262	And I just want people to shut up.
3325322	3326764	I want people to shut up.
3327245	3327765	Stop it.
3328306	3329668	Knock it the fuck off.
3329968	3330549	Can I talk?
3333055	3339938	I want real news on my TV, I want real news, I want what's actually going on in the world I want to know what's going on outside of America, do you hear me CNN?
3361388	3367929	That's why BBC America's news owns yours completely and utterly.
3368070	3369230	Sorry, it just does.
3369850	3370850	And I like CNN.
3370890	3375291	I like CNN much better than Fox News because Fox News is the shit that rats shit.
3375851	3376151	Okay?
3376731	3379652	It's like the feces of slugs.
3380052	3381032	And I hate slugs.
3383133	3384393	You know, you get more accuracy.
3384413	3385833	You should have a political talk show.
3386094	3387874	I have a blog whenever I post on it.
3389059	3390239	But, I mean, seriously.
3390740	3399443	It's like, I think it's completely sad that to find out anything that's actually going on in America and in the world, I have to go to the BBC.
3400483	3406806	It should be CNN or one of the good networks reporting our shit properly.
3407526	3413368	So, big finger to our American media.
3413868	3416789	A big finger to the gullible people who believe it.
3417830	3418130	You know,
3420544	3433571	I have a magnet on the door of my refrigerator that says listen to the effect of respect people that seek the truth doubt those who find it wow can I talk now?
3435752	3448039	I actually don't have a lot so that's fine you went a little long because I don't really have anything my FU goes to drama I'm sick of it and I choose not to be around it so whatever I got better things to do
3448922	3449402	That's right.
3450243	3450764	Better things.
3451924	3453045	That's it for the FUs of the week.
3453105	3454867	How about something a little more pleasant?
3455727	3457329	Even though this might drive us to some FUs, too.
3457349	3460051	Apparently our mailbag is quite thin this week, and that's very sad.
3461152	3463694	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
3463934	3468758	And the one and only DarkSakura will read them, as she'll do right now.
3468798	3470059	What, we have like one, two maybe?
3470239	3474282	One, actually, that came in while we were broadcasting from Cheeseburger.
3474623	3474923	All right.
3475816	3478518	Hey guys, I'm curious about your opinions on the new Star Trek movie.
3478918	3479859	I've seen it three times.
3480940	3481320	In a theater.
3482001	3485723	I'm 15, and I'm obsessed with Star Wars, but I never really saw anything in Star Trek.
3485803	3490247	I saw the movie two weeks ago with no expectations, because I'd never experienced anything Star Trek before.
3490387	3494830	I was blown away, and it was the first movie I'd ever gone to where everyone clapped at the end.
3495290	3496872	Actually, all three times I saw it, people clapped.
3497992	3503115	I knew I wanted to see it again as I was leaving the theater, which I did yesterday and plan to again next week.
3503175	3507377	I plan on buying the old shows and movies on eBay to catch up on some of the older stuff.
3507857	3513559	I've researched some stuff about the movie and I'd like to say Red Shirt Guy dies if you know what that means.
3513579	3515160	You're awesome if you don't go look it up.
3515800	3518181	It's not really a spoiler, just something they threw in from the old series.
3518342	3520863	Dude, okay, I will give you the rule right now.
3521043	3525085	If you're wearing a red shirt and no one knows who you are, you are going to die.
3526166	3530013	You know, next generation is yellow, but security officer, die, red shirt.
3531355	3536805	In fact, they sell on ThinkGeek a red ringer t-shirt that says expendable on it in the Star Trek font.
3539433	3542036	I will go ahead and say something, and I've said this before.
3542256	3544458	I was not a Trekkie originally.
3544698	3545459	I was a Whovian.
3546020	3560774	I grew up watching Doctor Who on PBS and not watching Star Trek, although I've seen a number of the original episodes in almost all of Next Generation and maybe a smattering here of DS9 and Voyager, and I watched three episodes of Enterprise and decided it was shit.
3562048	3562789	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3580982	3609438	and you know it's I actually you know I purchased something recently that was like the best four episodes of Star Trek ever the original series and they're great episodes and I want to say if you want to get a feel for the original series that will give you a decent smattering of what to expect just get this it's four episodes and among them are the one of them is Trouble with Tribbles which is supposed to be like the big favorite and I love that episode and
3609838	3614541	And also, it's just fantastic.
3614941	3618604	But yeah, go get some of those little samples first.
3618684	3619785	See how you feel about it.
3621145	3622346	I like Next Generation.
3622426	3625909	Going back and watching a bunch of it, though, you're going to find it really dated.
3626629	3631532	The old stuff will hold up because you expect it to be old, but Next Generation, we're talking about when I was early high school, 1990.
3632513	3634954	Next Generation now, believe it or not, is getting to be 20 years old.
3635155	3635415	Yeah.
3635435	3636656	So it's kind of like, oh boy.
3638177	3638337	But...
3640439	3666604	DS9 you know I didn't watch much of it I'm actually going to be going back and watching a bunch of it just because from what I understand it's probably the best of the series Voyager has its ups and downs I've seen crap episodes I've seen great episodes and yeah I'm sorry Jerry Ryan is hot but Enterprise is like I keep expecting Scott Bakula to jump I'm sorry to leap because he was you know from Quantum Leap I do want to remind though Jerry Ryan didn't show up until season 4 no that's right so
3668007	3670290	By the way, Star Trek, me personally, loved it.
3670550	3671792	Loved the movie, thought it was great.
3671952	3675677	It definitely kind of, J.J.
3675757	3681986	Abrams definitely said, I am fucking turning this car around right the fuck now and taking it in a new direction, but it needed it.
3682586	3683047	It needed it.
3683587	3685649	I hope we get a new series out of it.
3685789	3696437	I mean, even if the series isn't related to the movie, I hope it invigorates interest in Star Trek enough that we do get the uber nerdy series in the Voyager, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine canon.
3696798	3698339	Like, I want to see a new show like that.
3698699	3699600	That's not Enterprise.
3700481	3701361	Actually, I'll tell you what.
3701421	3705665	They've confirmed writing on the sequel now and got the whole cast.
3707290	3711177	And don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled about that too, but where's my weekly dose?
3711317	3712219	I want to see that too.
3712259	3713260	That would be very exciting.
3713641	3716786	I don't think I could watch the movie a million times in a theater like DarkSakura does.
3716947	3720753	Maybe I'd see it one more time, but I'll just buy it on Blu-ray when it comes out.
3721733	3723274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3747446	3749606	Well, I have to do it by season.
3749726	3750006	Sorry.
3750146	3750407	Fine.
3750767	3751927	So, original season?
3753767	3755447	Well, in the movie, I'm going to say right now, Scotty.
3755907	3757128	Because, I'm sorry, I love Simon Pegg.
3758148	3761968	Between him and Carl Urban, I'm sorry, that made the movie for me.
3762649	3764849	Carl Urban's McCoy was perfect.
3765189	3765809	And, oh my god.
3766929	3767489	Southern guy.
3768210	3769830	He just did the accent and everything just right.
3769870	3771090	It made me really happy.
3771250	3776111	But, Simon Pegg as Scotty was just like, Actually, he was probably my favorite in the original series, too.
3777451	3777691	Yeah.
3778712	3780052	Next Generation, it depends.
3780072	3782514	Because as a kid, I was that age.
3782834	3784094	I was a Wesley fangirl.
3784935	3800522	But getting older, it's all about Q. All about Q. I love Q. I love every bit of Q. So I'd actually have to say Q for Voyager as well since we've had Q. And I think that Seven and the Doctor are funny together.
3800885	3802586	Yeah, the Doctor was probably my favorite in Voyager.
3802767	3808511	For DS9, I'd actually have to say Jadzia or Worf.
3809852	3810953	I really liked Odo, though.
3811734	3813656	My favorite was Guinan.
3813896	3815057	Guinan will always be my favorite.
3815077	3815357	Yeah, Whoopi.
3815697	3815978	I know.
3816098	3816698	I love Whoopi.
3816798	3817319	What can I say?
3817479	3817719	All right.
3818420	3819881	We're being way too... This is a video game show.
3820121	3821322	But I will say this.
3821662	3825926	The fact that Star Trek is being made into this MMO, please don't suck.
3826426	3827167	Please don't suck.
3827287	3829589	Remember, I'm still making the race the Olarians.
3830612	3835115	Please, if there's God out there, do not let this game suck.
3835435	3838617	Because right now, Star Trek is riding such a high, high wave.
3838937	3840758	And there is so much potential.
3840798	3845101	But at the same time, there is so much they could fuck up beyond all belief.
3845441	3847863	And I am praying that this game doesn't suck.
3848003	3850424	Because I will be leaving all my other MMOs to play it.
3850564	3854207	I have to quote GameGuru on this, because honestly, I fully agree with this.
3854667	3857789	Carl Urbans McCoy makes me wonder if reincarnation exists.
3859190	3859430	Yes.
3859450	3859510	Yes.
3861624	3861864	All right.
3862765	3863525	That's it for the mailbag.
3863545	3867107	If you want to send us some emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
3867147	3868768	Hey, guys, your call soon.
3869608	3873491	But first, we have a little bit of gaming news for you guys and, of course, the classic game of the week.
3873511	3874811	We haven't forgot that yet.
3875272	3878754	But one more news story for you guys has to do with Forza Motorsport 3.
3879614	3880956	I think y'all know it's coming.
3881296	3882498	Y'all know it had to happen.
3882718	3895633	And sure enough, the German retail version of Amazon.com called Amazon.de has listed Forza Motorsport 3, Prima's official game guide, out on September 30th.
3896254	3896654	Whoops!
3897608	3899630	Forza Motorsport 3 is coming at some point.
3925988	3926748	Comments in chat.
3926788	3927949	Why didn't you read my email?
3928189	3929630	Because you sent it too late.
3930351	3930571	Yep.
3930871	3931632	We'll read it next week.
3932392	3932752	Maybe.
3933113	3933353	Maybe.
3933693	3935594	We'll go to the email.
3935654	3936195	Not the emails.
3936215	3936835	We already went to the emails.
3936855	3938276	We'll go to the Classic Game of the Week now.
3938696	3943980	Every week here on Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura likes to dig through the archives and find a game she thinks y'all ought to be playing.
3944020	3944480	So here it is.
3945701	3946902	Classic Game of the Week.
3948002	3949403	Classic Game of the Week is beer pong.
3950044	3950544	Awesome.
3950564	3950884	I'm kidding.
3951265	3953306	It's actually DuckTales.
3953606	3953946	Woo-hoo.
3954087	3954367	Woo-hoo.
3956938	3958439	It's about damn time I picked this one.
3958459	3961681	I didn't actually put in a gameplay one up because I wanted the best music in the game.
3961741	3963842	It's the moon music.
3963862	3965162	Sorry, moon level had the best music.
3979196	3996791	Um, so anyway, um, it is, um, of course, based off of the, uh, the Disney TV show, and it came out on Nintendo in 1989, and so you basically go around as Scrooge McDuck, um, who is going around to collect treasures all over the world, and the moon!
3997732	4002133	It came out on Game Boy, and it has nothing to do with DuckTales Quest for Gold.
4002873	4009915	So basically, this is really one of the top Capcom games from the Nintendo.
4011655	4017937	It actually had Tokoro Fujiwara and Yuki-chan's papa.
4019397	4021878	You gotta read the credits on some of the old Capcom games, I love it.
4023920	4026323	It was, you know, really tight to play.
4026523	4030747	You could use Scrooge's cane as a weapon and a PocoStick and was non-linear.
4031588	4039576	Um, so basically you're going around and you're helping NPCs and whacking enemies with a cane and telling them to get off your lawn or whatever.
4040457	4045683	Um, and you can actually play any of the levels in order, like I said, non-linear.
4045863	4060678	Um, you have a boss you have to fight at the end of each level, two hidden treasures, um, there's a golden ring in the African Mines and a golden mirror in the moon level, and after you've done all that, you go to Transylvania for some reason to do the boss fight.
4061599	4065220	So you can keep going back and unlock different parts of levels and do different stuff.
4065680	4068581	So you've got basically your DuckTales characters.
4068601	4076763	You have Scrooge, you have Kiwi, Dewey, and Lily, Webby, Gizmo, Duck, Launchpad, McQuack, Gyro, Gearloose, Ms.
4076823	4084805	Beakley, Bubba, Magica, Dispel, who is in Traptopania, Flintheart, Glomgold, and the Beagle Boys.
4086832	4099771	and then you also have an alternate ending in the NES version where if you finish the game with 10 million dollars and have both of the hidden treasures then you will have...
4101964	4110914	Uh, the news article come up with Scrooge winning, but he has a crown on his head, and a paper stating that he has stunned the world with his discovery of two lost treasures.
4111634	4112395	So that's pretty cool.
4114157	4116139	Um, so yeah, it was by, um, Capcom.
4116179	4118381	There were actually, there was actually a beta version that was out, too.
4119382	4124844	Um, and, uh, actually we were releasing the Consumer's Guide Hot Tip for, uh, coolest Nintendo's game.
4125244	4129245	At different levels, there was the Jungle, Ghost House, Underground, Snow Mountain, and Moon Surface.
4129805	4131885	Hamburgers were your power-ups instead of ice cream.
4132706	4139648	There, the coffins in the Ghost House had, um, uh, crosses on them, the coffins, sorry, had crosses on them instead of R.E.P.,
4141748	4151775	um although if you look in the NES Atlas um there are pictures of the original uh the moon music has a slower tempo music and I've actually heard it it's actually pretty good
4152778	4156543	The Ghost House had a different music track, and Gizmoduck went by Roboduck.
4158465	4162209	In the French version, it was called La Bande à Pichot.
4164872	4166394	It's the same DuckTales thing.
4166974	4173622	And the Famicom version was called One Paku Daku Yume Boken, which is Naughty Duck's Dream Adventure.
4176228	4178392	and it didn't have all the censorship.
4179414	4181658	So there was a DuckTales 2 game.
4181819	4183061	It was not as popular.
4183968	4190931	So, it really, though, is... And by the way, Yuki-chan's papa is Yoshihiro Sakaguchi.
4191691	4193552	So, yay.
4195372	4199734	And it's really one of the classic, classic, classics.
4199954	4202215	And, like, I had to play the moon level music first.
4202735	4205156	That is the identifiable stage.
4205196	4206837	You play the beginning of that.
4207497	4211019	And anyone who knows their gaming history will be able to point that right out.
4211419	4211779	So, yeah.
4211799	4211879	Yeah.
4214790	4217771	Alright, maybe that'll be Capcom's surprise announcement.
4218191	4221352	They have a secondary surprise announcement, they're supposed to make at E3, right?
4221392	4223192	How about DuckTales 3 on the Wii?
4224452	4227633	That's the sound you would hear across the world, fanboys shitting their pants.
4228533	4228994	That's right.
4230734	4238396	You know, also, just to say, you know, if we want to even look at any more of Yoshihiro Sakaguchi's games, we have 1943, well, 1943 Kai.
4243812	4264170	We have Final Fight, Legendary Wings, Forgotten Worlds, Mega Man, Mega Man 2 We have Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2, did sound design, Warriors of Fate So, pretty cool Very cool OneNightStands asks, hey DarkSakura, exactly why was this such a great game?
4264210	4266492	I loved it as a kid, but it plays like a lot of other platformers
4267893	4270394	It just really, it's all of the elements combined.
4270634	4273514	Really, when you look at everything together, it's all those pieces.
4273734	4278695	Yeah, I mean, yeah, there were a lot of platformers on the NES, but I think you had so many things falling into place on this one.
4278735	4281936	You had a pretty good game, which is very important.
4281956	4283136	You had a great license.
4283196	4286137	If you go back and do your favorite levels as much as you wanted to.
4286397	4286677	Right.
4286777	4290858	You had, you know, it was kind of like that Mega Man mixed with...
4291698	4294659	I don't know, like Mario style platformer and great music.
4295079	4296859	I mean, just everything kind of fell into place with this game.
4297539	4305821	I think one other reason, think about all the crap movie and cartoon and TV show tie-in games you have.
4306041	4306781	God, I know, right?
4306881	4308661	DuckTales breaks that mold.
4308681	4314782	And I think that might be one reason why people love it so much is that DuckTales was actually a pretty enjoyable game at the time it came out.
4315142	4315823	I really think so.
4316883	4317483	That would be my best answer.
4317503	4318063	I really agree with that.
4318922	4322065	That, Rob, dear friend, is a proper assessment
4346345	4350268	If you have more questions you want to ask us, our Skype line is open right now.
4350288	4354151	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4354171	4355532	You can call right now and give us a call.
4356252	4358474	In the meantime, I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories.
4358574	4359215	I don't have anything.
4359235	4360796	I don't think DarkSakura would have anything.
4360936	4361997	Actually... You never know.
4363178	4363978	Oh, gosh.
4368121	4369883	Alright, let's go to the phones.
4369923	4370483	We got a call.
4370543	4372425	Hi, you're on... Shut that thing up.
4372465	4373505	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4373525	4373886	Who's this?
4375168	4376569	Hi, this is Spazinator.
4377129	4377750	Hi, Spazinator.
4377770	4378530	What's on your mind tonight?
4380932	4381392	Not much.
4382573	4388857	I was going to join the IRC chat, but unfortunately it won't work on my PlayStation 3.
4391798	4399683	If you heard the Tale in a Bible show, I was asking about possibly buying an arcade machine.
4402048	4406256	What I'm specifically looking for is a classic game from the 80s up until the mid-90s.
4414227	4415248	Are you looking to buy a specific game?
4415288	4418009	Are you looking to collect or are you just looking to play?
4418029	4418309	I collect.
4441583	4448248	I would go eBay, honestly.
4448488	4449849	eBay or flea markets.
4450349	4451510	Or even like Craigslist.
4451910	4457153	Denios here in Roosevelt, Sacramento area, they sell old arcade cabinets.
4457213	4464158	You can even check some of the entertainment companies that rent out the games and ask if they're putting anything for sale.
4464378	4467360	eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, we've come to them that way.
4467600	4467800	Newspapers
4497382	4524041	so if you buy a game from the west coast you know you're going to have to pay an arm and a leg in shipping fees so you probably want to stick to things I mean you can certainly find your widest selection there on eBay but you would definitely want to stick to things like Craigslist and things that are going to be a little more local in your areas that you don't have to pay that obscene shipping fee you have the perk of having New York City not too too far away if you're especially willing to drive and pick something up with a pickup truck you can probably get some good deals
4525273	4528754	Yeah, the thing is, I never drove a day in my life.
4528854	4530855	I never bothered to get my license.
4531855	4552081	And I don't think, well, I don't have any relatives that really live in the area that have a driver's license and have enough free time on their hands that would be willing to essentially take me out to wherever, you know,
4552970	4557608	to pick up our kid gathering and drive her back to my place.
4558069	4558569	Well, that's fair.
4558609	4562050	I mean, if you don't have a license yourself, it's going to be kind of harder to get around and stuff.
4562810	4566411	So you may have to fork over those shipping fees, but just be prepared.
4566451	4576233	There's going to be shipping fees, and sometimes they're as much as the games are themselves because you're talking about sending a gigantic cabinet, which basically has to go on the back of a truck.
4576413	4580514	You are going to be spending a couple hundred dollars on shipping, so that's something you've got to prepare yourself for when shopping.
4580554	4583575	But if you can afford it, if that's within your budget, go for it.
4585086	4595093	Yeah, you know, if I do, you know, decide to go forward with this and get one, it'll probably be probably a few months before I get it.
4595133	4602517	But, you know, I kind of figured, you know, this would probably go hand in hand with, you know, my councils.
4602537	4606160	You know, it would be a nice conversation piece to talk about.
4606460	4608962	And not only that, but, you know, I kind of miss...
4610389	4614931	The whole arcade experience that I used to have when I was a little kid, going to the pizzeria to play games.
4614951	4616051	You're going to get one game.
4616071	4618252	And I know there's people that would spend a lot of money to have
4638738	4641259	Well, I have like a top five wish list.
4641939	4642279	It would be like...
4664355	4673271	World of Combat 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and then of course, Killer Instinct 2, and...
4677551	4682054	and then like the Neo Geo MVS, the four-slot one.
4682294	4684435	Now that, you know what?
4684595	4685295	Look into that.
4685435	4695780	That sounds like it might be a great option for you is those Neo Geo cabinets because of the fact you can fit like four games in there and that way you get that classic collectible thing mixed in with, hey, I have more than just one game in here.
4696181	4697301	That might be a good thing to look into.
4697361	4703264	But the good news is with those fighting games, they made so many of them, especially Street Fighter IIs, I'm sure you wouldn't have a hard time finding one at all.
4703664	4704745	Finding a working one,
4705506	4706146	Alright, thank you very much.
4706186	4706527	Have a good one.
4706547	4706727	Goodbye.
4735270	4736950	Rene says Prop Cycle, the poor man's DDR
4759455	4763717	Vid Power says Simpsons Arcade and let's see what else is there.
4763997	4766499	Captain Yes said I would kill for a Super Scope cabinet.
4767099	4767679	So there you go.
4770121	4771501	We just had Skype crash.
4771561	4772102	That was weird.
4772142	4773342	At least it didn't crash my whole computer.
4773382	4773923	Thank God.
4774403	4778965	Skype just crashed sadly and I was in the middle of a call when it did so so I apologize to the caller.
4779426	4785089	Hopefully they will be able to get through again but I am firing Skype back up so we can take more calls and we look like we're back up.
4786189	4786689	Sorry about that.
4786729	4787770	That's kind of crappy.
4789936	4791437	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype.
4791977	4792758	Live radio, guys.
4792818	4796100	Sometimes Skype will crash on us as we're doing the show live.
4797301	4801505	Yeah, I like what Bobby in chat is saying, talking about getting a 2DX cabinet.
4801545	4804727	You know, I think if I were to drop the money, I'd have to get something Mamani-related.
4804947	4806789	Yeah, I think I'd get a 2DX.
4807249	4808530	Honestly, I think I'd want a Happy Sky.
4809071	4809371	We'll see.
4809671	4810532	Hey, we got another call.
4810592	4811533	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4811573	4811873	Who's this?
4812557	4813838	Wow, I can't believe I got through for this.
4813858	4814839	This is my first time calling.
4814859	4815559	This is X-Link.
4815659	4816540	Well, hi, X-Link.
4816560	4817981	Congratulations on making it through.
4818121	4819062	Thank you.
4819262	4822985	You lucked out because some other, unfortunately, we were on the line with another call and then Skype crashed.
4823005	4825948	And I really feel bad, but that's just live radio sometimes.
4825988	4828209	And hey, you got through and you've never been on before.
4828490	4829110	So what's on your mind?
4829871	4834794	Well, first off, I don't know exactly about the pinball games exactly.
4836685	4837865	Arcade, I'm sorry, arcade games.
4838005	4842607	I know a little more about pinballs than I do arcade because I used to work on them working at arcade.
4842687	4852209	But yeah, the ones like Street Fighters and the use of those ones are a little more commonplace to find than you would with some of the other ones.
4853169	4855410	The more newer they are, the easier to find, of course.
4855430	4859231	The more harder they're to find is the more older they are, so...
4859994	4871322	You really would have to search, and I know he's overseas, so that would probably be even more hard than it is over here in the US, where it's a tad bit more commonplace, maybe than, say, over here in Sweden.
4872403	4880849	It really depends on all of those factors, but I do agree, the best way to find an arcade game without having to pay all the shipping, look for an arcade near you that's closing down.
4881550	4882971	Yeah, no joke.
4883593	4908176	um but like I said before we closed down unfortunately my arcade we had like four and a half pages full of arcade different arcade games so I mean yeah if I want this nearly getting ready to close down you probably can pick one up for a good price well there you go hopefully uh the advice will be taken even though I think that last caller wasn't overseas they're upstate New York but I know we do have other listeners that are overseas that can take that um uh advice to heart well what else is on your mind
4909755	4911637	Glee, great show, first off.
4912198	4920867	But I was calling more in tone to THQ and their golden weed that they sent over to overseas there.
4922156	4923738	Glee was amazing, by the way.
4923798	4930765	If folks need a new TV show to watch, even though there's only the one episode, definitely reminded me of being a music geek in high school.
4931185	4938313	Before we made it a short show tonight when Loki wasn't able to be here, we were going to talk about the Golden Wii.
4938833	4941136	Tell us a little bit about this and what you wanted to say about it.
4942177	4957135	THQ which unfortunately lost a major amount of money over the last year which I thought that was even more ironic decided to send a golden Wii overseas to the UK to give to the Queen as a thank you
4958940	4959640	Thank you for what?
4959941	4961002	Just being queenly?
4961803	4965146	Well, it's a way to promote their new game.
4965807	4966227	Gotcha.
4966848	4971092	I was going to say, though, come on, I don't think the queen is really going to play this Wii.
4971152	4980062	I mean, you know, she's obviously a little old, and I think every time I've seen her on TV and stuff, she seems to have limited mobility.
4980602	4984845	I'm sure some would argue with me whether that means she can't play the Wii or not, but, you know, come on.
4985005	4986926	She's the freaking queen of England.
4986966	4989127	I think she's got better things to do than sit there and play the Wii.
4989587	4996011	However, I think it's one of those things that you'll see in a museum someday, is the Wii the queen once owned, even though she never touched it.
4997452	5002395	Actually, she has a, supposedly she was playing the Wii before with the prince.
5002495	5004296	Supposedly there was articles about that.
5004356	5007337	So that's why they sent her over one, so she could have one of her own.
5007638	5008578	I stand corrected.
5008618	5010099	What a great photo op that must have been.
5010989	5011594	Thanks for watching!
5012964	5014525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5041963	5043704	and if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong again.
5043764	5044425	What else is new?
5045645	5047687	Nah, that's pretty much about it I can think of.
5047707	5051829	I'm looking forward to see what comes out of E3 in a couple weeks out of all these rumors and stuff.
5051949	5053790	Let's see which ones are true and which ones are false.
5054070	5054491	Me too.
5055191	5061075	Out of curiosity, since OLR can't compete with the commercial sites, what do you want us to bring you from E3?
5063840	5069062	Whatever news is not given, I guess, because a lot of it's going to be hard because a lot of the news soon is going to break.
5069122	5072703	It's going to be posted all over the web and Twitter and Facebook and all that.
5073923	5075824	It's going to be harder this year.
5076004	5084267	There's no Kensha Hall for everyone to ignore or do the nice fluff piece that is the one article on the entirety of Kensha Hall.
5084847	5092750	From what I understand, we're not having that this year, so it's going to be difficult to really dig around, but we will try to find the Kensha in E3 for you guys.
5093624	5099966	What I would like to see is maybe even what the independent people are doing.
5100006	5107209	What are some of these games that are below key that should have been the major hits that are maybe not as hits?
5108245	5110546	I will do my best to dig up the independent stuff for you guys.
5110566	5113026	I think that's where we're going to have to find our niche this year.
5113086	5118508	I bet there's a lot of people that want to be heard and they're going to be excited to have somebody care.
5118928	5120168	And certainly, you know what?
5120728	5122208	Let's find the next Braid.
5122568	5124409	Let's find the next Katamari Damacy.
5124709	5127750	Let's find that next big thing that hasn't been discovered yet.
5128830	5129410	I like that idea.
5130750	5131010	All right.
5131171	5133071	Well, X-Link, we've got to let you go so we can take some more calls.
5133111	5134451	But thank you so much, first-time caller.
5134651	5136432	No problem.
5136492	5137332	Call us again sometime.
5137918	5138338	Oh, definitely.
5138459	5139039	Alright, later, dude.
5139579	5139800	Thanks.
5141461	5142422	We'll take some more calls.
5142982	5145685	By the way, some other comments from chatroom on what they want to see from E3.
5146105	5149127	RLBX327 wants to know about the iPhone games at E3.
5149888	5152090	Actdeft says, King of Fighter 12 details.
5152370	5158896	You know, I did get an email about a pre-tournament that's going on, but it's going on, like, I think the Sunday before E3, so sadly we'll still be here.
5158976	5159516	We can't go.
5159897	5161678	But I know there's going to be some tournaments going on.
5162359	5165962	AlphaCatanagram wants some Katamari Forever footage and a soundtrack bootleg.
5165982	5166422	Hmm.
5166882	5169584	I don't know how Namco would feel about a bootleg on our site, but we'll try.
5171285	5172346	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5172366	5172746	Who's this?
5175788	5176869	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5176889	5177209	Who's this?
5180327	5182128	Hello, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
5182248	5183429	Okay, the caller isn't there apparently.
5183449	5187752	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
5188032	5193315	Remember, you can always test the calls before giving us a call at echo123 is the username on Skype.
5193595	5197898	And that's a great way to make sure that your microphone is working and all that fun stuff before you actually call us.
5198278	5200139	Of course, that doesn't work with a touchtone phone.
5201040	5202160	Touchtone phones are much easier though.
5202180	5203241	You just pick up the phone and call.
5203601	5206323	I don't think I've ever seen a phone not work, although I have seen them be quite...
5206443	5208585	DJ Ranma S, I went to Anime Boston 2009 this weekend on Saturday
5233818	5234759	Ah, and how was that?
5234819	5246209	I'm happy to hear that there was some OLR meetups going on, because I know somewhere in the Bay Area right now, GS68 is crying because he's the only OLR guy at Faname, which I'm very sad I didn't get to this year, but next year, next year.
5246389	5247310	Well, how was Anime Boston?
5249111	5249571	It was good.
5251053	5253695	I guess it was my first convention.
5254035	5255636	I really didn't know what to expect, but...
5257072	5258474	It was pretty good.
5259395	5265381	One of the first things I did was find DJ Ranma S. He was selling some stuff.
5265741	5271126	He didn't seem to have any good luck this weekend, but he said overall he had a good time, I guess.
5271146	5274790	I guess he'll be calling in maybe next week to talk about it.
5274830	5275911	I think he's getting home late.
5276251	5277012	Oh, I'm sure he will.
5277212	5280275	Today's his birthday, too, if I'm not mistaken, so happy birthday to that if you're listening.
5280296	5280636	Yes, it is.
5280896	5282137	Everybody wish him a happy birthday.
5282157	5282798	I know I did.
5303417	5311880	Um, you know, and this crosses over into video games too, because I'll tell you, you can't walk through one of these hallways without seeing some Kingdom Hearts inspired, you know, fan art or something.
5311920	5312860	Did you see any art?
5312920	5314601	I don't know if you looked around the art.
5314641	5317462	Did you see some art that really jumped out of you that you thought was awesome?
5317502	5318022	And what was it?
5318892	5320073	I saw a lot of stuff.
5320213	5324097	I saw anything from like anime stuff from like Death Note.
5324437	5328121	I've seen the typical stereotypical stupid Naruto stuff.
5328221	5331304	That's just my opinion, not fact, but that's not my thing.
5332065	5333766	I also found video game stuff.
5334547	5338691	Like basically, what did you say you were wondering if there was there?
5339338	5339798	Oh, I don't know.
5340039	5342901	I know there's always something Kingdom Hearts, but did anything kind of jump out at you?
5342921	5344142	Kingdom Hearts, yes.
5344162	5345203	Okay, let me give you an example.
5345703	5347245	Let me give you an example.
5347285	5350447	When I was at ASEN, I actually bought this.
5350487	5355932	I thought it was so rad because I bought it for my boyfriend, who I know is a big fan of this.
5356292	5361757	But they actually had an art dealer table, and she had a drawing of David Bowie from Labyrinth.
5361877	5363559	And I just thought that was so awesome.
5363619	5366642	I'm like, how random to find something like that at an anime con.
5366902	5369425	But did you see anything that jumped out at you like that?
5369465	5372087	Like, wow, I didn't expect to see that at an art dealer table.
5375591	5380253	I guess pretty much everything was unexpected for me.
5380293	5381994	Like I said, this was my first con.
5382594	5392919	I saw, I mean, they were selling a little... I also have a friend in chat called Robocon that doesn't seem to get to listen to OLR a lot, but he tries to catch the podcast.
5392939	5393860	He's live in there now.
5395501	5403406	We went together on Saturday and they had little buttons they were selling for $0.50 to $1.
5404427	5412232	I got a little thing from The World Ends With You, that little pin that you'd get in that portable RPG game that says you're in the game thing.
5414927	5416308	Oh yeah, I know.
5416388	5417089	Okay, that's cool.
5417289	5422712	And yeah, The World Ends With You definitely has its fans, especially the Squeenix fans.
5422752	5423693	So okay, cool, cool.
5424434	5424694	Yeah.
5425795	5432499	I also saw something interesting as a stained glass thing of various Death Note anime characters.
5432679	5438463	It had the character, the Detective L, but it was like a vampire version of him with blue hair.
5438483	5439484	That was pretty cool.
5440543	5443365	I think they used the ballroom for the video game thing.
5474003	5476005	What kind of games did you see in the room when you went there?
5478368	5481111	I saw they had a Street Fighter 4 tournament going on.
5481652	5485376	I finally got to play poppin' music.
5485496	5487018	That was a pretty cool experience.
5487378	5488199	I love poppin' music.
5489332	5492073	Yeah, I know.
5492093	5493193	That's why I brought that up.
5493754	5499436	And the interesting thing is they did have the Rock Band 2 set up on the Xbox 360.
5499776	5507939	The interesting thing I saw was the Nintendo Wii that they had actually was running on the Homebrew channel.
5507999	5509960	The Homebrew channel which allows you to run like...
5511132	5513714	Selfmade Applications, among other things.
5514134	5518817	And they were using it for perfectly legitimate reasons, so I thought it was kind of cool.
5519057	5526101	Okay, I've got one more question for you before we let you go, and it actually comes from our chat room from our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf, heard before us here Sunday nights on All Games Radio.
5526641	5531484	Bobby asks, Anime Boston is in the same place as PAX Boston is going to be.
5531944	5533605	How is the size of the place?
5533705	5537948	Because some people are speculating it may not be big enough for an event the size of PAX.
5539797	5557592	Um, I think, I think that it's, well, I think there's like three floors, um, three, I think it's like a three floor place, and, uh, we were all around it, and, uh, it's pretty big, it really is, it's bigger than I thought it was gonna be.
5558112	5567920	It's like, there's a mall that's like attached to it, like, and we got some food there afterwards, but it's pretty big, I mean, even without that, the convention center itself, I mean...
5569228	5597462	so yeah I think it could handle PAX East because I mean the attendance just keeps climbing every year on Anime Boston as it is so yeah it could probably handle that that's interesting news because I was I saw that the I was expecting it to be Memorial Day weekend the next week and it wasn't so I saw that it was like April 2nd or 4th from Anime Boston so probably somebody else like took the Memorial Day weekend it happens it happens there's a lot of big conventions Memorial Day weekend
5597863	5602663	Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, but thanks so much for the report, and glad to hear you enjoyed your first con.
5604129	5604830	Thanks a lot, Rob.
5606031	5609713	Maybe I'll see you at PAX Boston, speaking of which, since it sounds like it's in the neck of the woods.
5609813	5610794	I'll see what I can do.
5612775	5615557	I'll have to work things out, but we'll meet someday.
5616378	5618339	I'll see you later.
5619220	5619480	Bye.
5620621	5622802	I'll get you next time, Gadget.
5624103	5624403	Why not?
5624423	5626985	We'll do one more call if it comes in pretty soon here on the phones.
5627005	5628106	How are you doing over there, DarkSakura?
5628706	5629246	I'm doing fine.
5629266	5630728	I'm actually checking for video game sims.
5631088	5631328	Oh yeah?
5631488	5636252	I found one of Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 4, so that's a pretty good one.
5636432	5636872	That's fun.
5637332	5639174	You know, I still have yet to play Resident Evil 5.
5639214	5640034	What the hell's wrong with me?
5640515	5642416	But outside of the demo.
5644337	5647980	Alright, well, our phones sadly are not really ringing right now, so we're going to go ahead and close up the lines.
5648000	5648440	Damn it, call!
5648621	5649161	No, it's too late.
5649181	5649862	I closed up the lines.
5650302	5651843	We're at about an hour and a half now anyway, and
5652213	5657236	I want to go run out and get some food and enjoy the rest of my Memorial Day weekend as I'm sure a lot of you folks do.
5657596	5661218	So we're going to go ahead and go around and start to wrap things up and get on out of here for the evening.
5661819	5662559	In ribbons and bows?
5663179	5663760	If we want to.
5664380	5666021	We'll go around and get everybody's final thought.
5666101	5669103	I guess we'll start with me tonight, although I don't have much of a final thought tonight.
5669483	5671844	My final thought is yogurt.
5672445	5673305	I want yogurt.
5673365	5674446	I want some too.
5674466	5675847	It would be amazing right now.
5675867	5676547	It would be some yogurt.
5676587	5677908	It would be fantastical.
5678351	5680215	Not FroGurt, but Yogurt.
5680416	5682420	Because the FroGurt has potassium benzoate.
5684304	5684684	Never mind.
5685767	5687150	DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?
5689334	5689655	Porn.
5690848	5691569	Thank you for watching!
5712812	5716294	Again, if you like the show, please tell two people you know about the program.
5716614	5718195	Help spread the good word about the show.
5718275	5723018	Help offset those a-holes that leave negative reviews on websites because they have nothing better to do with their sorry ass lives.
5723898	5729581	Because it really helps us have the motivation to keep going when you guys say good things about us.
5730062	5732783	And just knowing we have certain people that would be here every week.
5733123	5734324	I also like when you send me money.
5735464	5746351	Although sometimes it can be frustrating when people bitch and moan and bellyache when you go a week without a show or that the podcast was late or whatever, it does show that people care enough to complain.
5746931	5751234	So I actually kind of see the good in that and thanks everybody for your passion around the show.
5751654	5753875	That is very motivating, surprisingly enough.
5754135	5756257	So keep us on our toes, I guess is what I'm saying.
5756417	5757097	Twinkle toes.
5757277	5757697	There you go.
5758158	5758838	All right, that's it.
5759258	5759779	We're out of here.
5759939	5762120	Have a great night, everybody, and tune in next week.
5762140	5764522	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
