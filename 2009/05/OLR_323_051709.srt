00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,280
Today, May 17, 2009, the studio behind Duke Nukem Forever closes.

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,480
Details are revealed on Guitar Hero 5.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,640
And could a popular import fighting game be U.S. bound?

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,780
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,880
Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,800
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,400
That's right, we're back May 17, 2009.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,980
We were off last week, that was my bad.

10
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,200
This is Rob Roberts here with you every week on the show, except last week.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,040
Joining us, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,800
What are you doing in my house?

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Yes, we have a studio change tonight, which is kind of interesting.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,080
The AC at Studio Roberts broke, so now we're here at Studio Dark Sakura, and it's kind

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,960
of different, but good.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,180
I'm hoping the sound is still the same and everybody is hearing things like they were

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,580
before.

19
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,620
This is kind of nice though, because in this compacted space, I'm able to adjust audio

20
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,160
a little easier as we go, so hopefully there's no popping and breaking tonight on the show.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
We'll see.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Although I think Dark Sakura might have been a little loud, but that's all right.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,540
We'll fix these things as we go.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,540
It's live radio.

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,540
What can you do?

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,800
You just have to kind of fix things as they come up, but we'll still be taking your calls.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,920
We're wired for everything except Justin TV, sadly.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,540
We have to say goodbye to Justin TV for tonight, but we're hoping to get that back in a future

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,920
week.

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,440
We might actually relocate within the relocation for the summer into a bigger space here in

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
the house.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
We'll see.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,680
Anyway, I won't bore you with the details, but I will bore you with the one and only

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
tech master, Loki.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Hello.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,400
How are you doing, Loki?

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Could be better.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Oh, really?

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm sitting on a step stool that's as hard as a rock.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
We'll figure it out.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,500
Maybe at the halfway point we can switch and you can stay on.

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,560
We can get you a chair for next week.

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,000
We'll figure something out.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We'll work it out.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,600
Anyhow, we're back, and of course we have a little time to catch up on, so we'll play

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,400
a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, because that's how we always start things

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
off.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
So How Was Your Gaming Week?

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Well, I played Sims.

51
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Sims 2.

52
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
That's about it.

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,400
Do you like to torture your Sims, or do you actually play it legitimately?

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,160
I actually have been tweaking my Sims to try to put more stuff, modding more this, that,

55
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,560
and the other, and now I have a dirty object.

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,840
So, just to see how it worked, and now I'm curious.

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Okay.

58
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
We'll leave it at that then, I suppose.

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Yes.

60
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,480
Are you excited for Sims 3?

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Kind of.

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,280
I was looking on the Twitter earlier, and looking at the friends list on the Twitter,

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,680
and apparently some of our listeners are pretty excited, because I guess Sims 3 just leaked

64
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,480
out, so some folks are already downloading that and having fun with it.

65
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Really?

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
Uh-oh.

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
No, not during the show.

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Yeah, not during the show.

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,440
Leave it to Loki in five minutes to try and pirate something from the new location, geez.

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
And share.

71
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Alright.

72
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I'm not surprised, though, especially with, although I am surprised it's so early, a lot

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,920
of EA leaks this week.

74
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,520
But of course, Loki will buy the game if he enjoys it.

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Of course I will.

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Alright.

77
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Anyhow.

78
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,240
No, I probably won't enjoy it, though, just like I enjoyed Spore.

79
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,560
I found the case for that today with the DVD inside, and I'm like, oh yeah, I have Spore.

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
More like Bore.

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Alright.

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,040
Well, that's it for Dark Cyros gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,200
My gaming week was pretty brief, I spent most of the week flashing all my drives, upgrading

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,960
the drive firmwares in all my 360s, so now instead of having one modded 360, I have four

85
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,320
of the five so far, because the last one which had the light on drive, which is a bitch and

86
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:12,080
a half the flash, the setup I had didn't want to work with it correctly, and so it was able

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,240
to grab the key and that kind of stuff, but I had to actually take my broken 360 and take

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,480
that drive and spoof it as the one.

89
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,340
Anyways, so basically I have four modded systems now, and the whole reason we have four modded

90
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,800
systems is because we're playing four modded copies of Grand Theft Auto IV in our company

91
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,880
Deathmatch that we do, and it's all sorts of fun.

92
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,460
Right now we're testing out some of the new weapons that I'm building for it.

93
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,640
One of them is kind of like, I'm calling it the Hurricane Bomb, and basically what it

94
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:50,000
does is you fire it and it creates a giant physics force that will toss people around.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
No damage, but it will throw people and you can throw them into walls and stuff and that

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,440
causes damage.

97
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,180
So we've been playing with that and it's absolutely distracting.

98
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,880
You know what kind of weapon you need to make?

99
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,180
And maybe I just have Star Trek on the brain because that movie was so fucking epic.

100
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,880
You need a red matter weapon, that's what you need.

101
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,320
I tried making something- How could you program a singularity in a game?

102
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,080
Something to create a black hole- Something to make the game suck!

103
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,960
There's nothing to create, unfortunately, a negative physics force.

104
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,080
You can sort of, I don't know, the game won't let you do that, because if it could, I've

105
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,880
already thought about that and, you know, a bomb that would explode, suck everything

106
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,960
towards it, which would be pretty sweet.

107
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
But that doesn't work.

108
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,880
And I tried creating a flamethrower and that didn't really work as well.

109
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,120
The game's just very sensitive and some of the things I'm trying to make it do causes

110
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,160
the crash and that's not good.

111
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,940
So that's just fun, you know, to basically play against each other.

112
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,280
Really the only reason I need to mod all four systems is because if you put one of the weapons

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,520
on- The way it calculates damage and physics and stuff like that, you actually have to

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,840
have all the systems modded the same with the same kind of, you know, edits to the game

115
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,200
in order for it to work correctly, because otherwise it just doesn't work.

116
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,640
But yeah, it's been a lot of fun and I'm trying to get some more stuff added into that.

117
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,440
So aside from playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC and Lost and Damned on the 360,

118
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,160
I've also been playing Rock Band Unplugged because that somehow leaked online and so,

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,240
you know, I have to check it out.

120
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,960
Honestly I'm glad I checked it out this way because I can't see myself purchasing this

121
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
game.

122
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,000
I think I get bored with it really fast.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Really?

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why?

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Because I get bored with Rock Band pretty fast.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,720
It's just not the same as playing like Rock Band.

127
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,880
I mean it's, you know, frequency amplitude so at least that way they can kind of add

128
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,200
music that would normally not be in like Rock Band, you know, doesn't have to necessarily

129
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
be rock music.

130
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,220
They can do electronica and all that sort of stuff.

131
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,480
But I don't know.

132
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,400
Like I spent more time I think customizing my characters than I did actually playing

133
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
the game.

134
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,520
And it's alright.

135
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,000
It's what it is I guess.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,560
But I don't know.

137
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
It's just alright.

138
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,560
I don't think I'd buy it though.

139
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,140
How does it compare to like frequency and amplitude in all those games we think this

140
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,440
game was inspired by?

141
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,060
Honestly I've never really, I haven't played too much of frequency or amplitude but from

142
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,280
the little that I have played it's pretty much the same type of thing.

143
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,240
You know, except kind of the Rock Band set up where you have the same sort of graphics

144
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,120
that you'd see in Rock Band except you're jumping between three, you know, four different

145
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
tracks.

146
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,720
And you are switching a lot through there and that's kind of where I mess up usually

147
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
in the songs.

148
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,280
Because the songs themselves aren't that hard.

149
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,040
Obviously I'm not playing on like expert difficulty or anything like that but I'm just playing

150
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,320
on normal difficulty that's in the game.

151
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,720
It's not that hard but it's just, you know, jumping back and forth between tracks.

152
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,960
You know, I miss usually the first note or something like that because I'm like oh crap

153
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,520
oh it doesn't want me to jump here it wants me to jump here and it's like uhh, it's kind

154
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
of annoying.

155
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,080
But I don't know, it's alright.

156
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,640
I guess, I mean there's no real good music games on the PSP other than like DJ Max so

157
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,120
you know, more than merrier I guess.

158
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,640
I still kind of want to buy it, we'll see, we'll see.

159
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,180
Okay so my gaming week, before I get to my gaming week since I did kind of invoke Star

160
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,460
Trek I just have to say, oh my god, was that not like the greatest thing ever?

161
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,800
Like that movie was so awesome and like I know there's probably some people out there

162
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,840
that don't really want to hear it because like you know every movie has it's detractors

163
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,760
but I got to tell you, you don't have to be a Trekkie to appreciate Star Trek.

164
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,000
That was the goal I think.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,080
You'll appreciate it more probably if you aren't a Trekkie.

166
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,200
You'll pick up on a lot of in-jokes if you're a Trekkie but I think one thing I like about

167
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
what J.J. Abrams did is that they took out, and the writers, they took out a lot of like

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,020
the techno talk.

169
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,520
You know, they made it very accessible to anybody and the acting was great.

170
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,480
I was so surprised by the guy who played Kirk.

171
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,360
I think was actually my favorite which is amazing because usually I'm a huge Sylar fan

172
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,880
but I was just kind of thinking about it today.

173
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,600
I do think though that his Spock was pretty hardcore.

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,280
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, he was awesome.

175
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
They were all great.

176
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,360
The closest though of anybody was McCoy.

177
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:07,040
He must have had his séance before you know filming every day and channeled De Force Kelly

178
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,120
because he was perfect and better than being Cupid.

179
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
It makes me more excited.

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Did you recognize him?

181
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
No, I didn't.

182
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
No, I didn't.

183
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
He was Cupid in Xena.

184
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Okay, okay.

185
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,600
No, I haven't seen Xena in so long but it made me more excited for the Star Trek MMO

186
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
because I'm hoping this invigorates a whole new life into Star Trek like I hope we get

187
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,240
a new show like I don't think we'll get a show out of this movie like you know the actors

188
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,480
in this are too big I think to want to do a TV show every week in fact one of them's

189
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
already doing a TV show every week but I'm all considering the way that show's gonna

190
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,480
you know kind of headed he may not be doing that TV show much longer true he might be

191
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,440
suddenly available but I'm I'm hoping that at least we'll get a new like you know maybe

192
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,480
something in the next generation canon you know some something after you know that I

193
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,480
just don't want another prequel I'd like to see something later well these aren't this

194
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,760
isn't a prequel I know I don't want spoilery but you know what I mean it's it's I know

195
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,040
I know I just want out there now that you can say it's a franchise reboot yeah that's

196
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,120
that's for sure that's for sure it's very interesting they're talking about that possibly

197
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,800
in the in the sequel they're gonna do Khan again which would be very interesting they

198
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,080
could do Khan the first time around it's we have no Montalban I know it'd be weird we

199
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,120
have no rich Corinthian leather all right anyhow sorry I didn't mean to derail the show

200
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,100
but you know what this this this Star Trek movie being so good makes me excited like

201
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,040
for the game that's coming out you know in a little while and I haven't played the Xbox

202
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,600
Live arcade game that's out there but like the MMO I'm talking about it makes me all

203
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,520
excited for Star Trek I'm making us a race huh I'm making us an official race the olorians

204
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,560
the olorians that'd be awesome and of course my other character is gonna be an Orion side

205
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,760
girl so why not all right anyhow my gaming week though I didn't play a whole lot of new

206
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,360
stuff I've just been kind of busy in my personal life like Dark Sakura but I did get a chance

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,840
to check out space invaders extreme on the Xbox Live arcade marketplace which is of course

208
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,640
pretty much a port of the PSP version of the game although there have been some changes

209
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,560
of course now they have the multiplayer mode and things a lot of fun it's fun to play on

210
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,760
my big TV with my big sound system and I think it's great for 10 bucks I think it's a lot

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,440
of fun I think the game itself is pretty simple which I think is a good thing I think it's

212
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,920
very easy to get into and you know I think it's a type of game I might want to put some

213
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,120
headphones on and just kind of get sucked into which is weird because you think I'd

214
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
enjoy it more on the PSP and I do it's a great PSP game but I like the fact that now it has

215
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,160
some online modes it's kind of expanded on Xbox Live Arcade so is the game worth buying

216
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,120
twice yes I think so I think $10 is a fair price for the game and I think it's fun but

217
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,560
of course I also love retro upgraded classics like you know I loved Pac-Man versus I even

218
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,880
like the new Galaga you know I love these souped up retro games usually you know when

219
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,040
it comes to like Leisure Shoot Larry not so much but you know so a lot of the ones especially

220
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,820
they've been putting out on Xbox Live Arcade lately have been great now one other place

221
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,800
that I did get to play a lot of arcade games this week was I went to of course Anime Central

222
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,080
or Asen for short which is where I was and why we weren't here last week on the show

223
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
but they had a little game room set up and I got to play some of the arcade games they

224
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,800
had in there such as BeatMania 2DX Gold I believe it was was in there which is cool

225
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,480
because I hadn't played 2DX in a couple months even though we have one here in town I just

226
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,820
never seemed to check out there and then I also played Guitar Freaks which is interesting

227
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:30,620
because I haven't played Guitar Freaks in a very long time like the last time I remember

228
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:36,240
actually playing Guitar Freaks was probably not long after I originally bought Guitar

229
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,760
Hero on the Xbox you know so it's been like a long time and it's kind of interesting that

230
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,920
can your Guitar Hero and Rock Band skill help you improve in Guitar Freaks yes a little

231
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,220
bit except the timing is much different and Guitar Freaks I'm sorry is still not as great

232
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,360
of a game it needs a reboot it needs JJ Abrams to come fix it is what Guitar Freaks needs

233
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,040
Rock Revolution not so much so I don't know if that series is dead or what but it was

234
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,720
it was fun to revisit I mean it does have songs you know if you like the j-rock you

235
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
know you're not really going to get a lot of those songs in the games over here but

236
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,480
uh yeah Guitar Freaks stick a fork in it it's pretty much done it needs a reboot like most

237
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,360
Bomani games right now need a reboot JJ Abrams needs to go work for Konami and reboot everything

238
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,440
over there I think except for Metal Gear Solid that franchise is doing alright still he should

239
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,280
be directing Metal Gear Solid movie that'd be amazing but you know that guy's gonna be

240
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,360
in demand now so dream on on that one alright um let's see what else did I play at the con

241
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,480
I watched people playing in the groove 2 and pump it up NX and DDR but there was so many

242
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,720
people playing all those games I was a little disappointed by their console showing though

243
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,240
especially the first night like half their TVs weren't even on and I was like how did

244
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,960
they not have Tatsunoko versus Capcom at an anime convention of course they had it by

245
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,040
Saturday night but a little disappointed in the console showing in their game room but

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,440
it got a little better as the con went on I don't know if they had some snafus or what

247
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,460
but um one of the things I thought was cool was at the con there were nine of us sharing

248
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,540
a hotel room yes nine of us sharing a hotel room Misty of course if you listen to show

249
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,000
a long time you probably recognize that name as one of our OLR supporters organized this

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,360
whole thing amongst you know a lot of folks she knew and just what have you kind of like

251
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,680
friends of friends and there were nine of us in a room but what was cool about that

252
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,360
is one night we had Street Fighter IV going on the TV in the hotel room which was a plasma

253
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,200
HD TV it was a nice TV because this is the Hyatt it was a pretty nice hotel so we hooked

254
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,860
up two arcade sticks to the TV and just had a ball with it it was a lot of fun and congrats

255
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:50,360
by the way to OLR me member Rob D for winning the Street Fighter IV tournament at ASEN very

256
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,920
nice work so that was pretty much it for my gaming week I had a good time I had fun at

257
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,160
the convention and yeah thanks to everybody who came out for the panel and if you are

258
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,700
a new listener of the show because of the panel I'm surprised there were a lot of people

259
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,000
there that hadn't really heard the show before but said they would check it out so hello

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,640
to everybody from ASEN who is listening and thank you very much for tuning in to Orange

261
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,120
Lounge Radio so let's move on and get into some news you're probably sick about hearing

262
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,440
about us let's give them some news first we have some housekeeping to take care of the

263
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,040
SmileDK giveaway is tonight and you have about like 10 minutes to get your entries in I know

264
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,160
I said on the Twitter 5 o'clock but because of the studio move you got a little extra

265
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,240
time but we're going to have to take care of that during the break tonight so if you

266
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,840
don't know what I'm talking about guess you should have downloaded last week's podcast

267
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,940
you might be too late now unless you hurry Dark Soccer you have housekeeping tonight

268
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,720
yeah we had um didn't he also win the turbo graphics he did and I wasn't able to take

269
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,160
that to him but yeah because I can't find it uh oh well no it's just I mean you see

270
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,640
how much stuff I have I I have an idea where it is trust me as soon as I locate the turbo

271
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,520
graphics it's yours yeah otherwise I was saying a Saturn with no cords he uh well maybe we

272
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,240
can give that away in a future show I think I have a spare hookups he asked he actually

273
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,920
asked me about it but he you know I was like oh she didn't have a chance to see me he understood

274
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,080
he knew you've been busy so he he knows he'll get it pulling my brain out through my ears

275
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,440
that's all right school sucks uh and let's see uh of course I already mentioned that

276
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,720
we're at a new summer home for the show so we've for those of you stalking at home we've

277
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,440
moved from Rancho Cordova to what Citrus Heights are we in now are we technically in Citrus

278
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,080
Heights yes we have no longer in Rancho Cambodia all right so we've uh moved the show that's

279
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,880
right there'll be less gunshots here in uh Citrus Heights that'll be nice unless uh police

280
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,160
helicopters flying overhead at the end of the show uh and unfortunately though there's

281
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,920
no justin tv tonight we're hoping to have it up again next week but it may be a little

282
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,600
while just because we had to move a lot over here and justin tv has a lot of cable and

283
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,800
wires so remember guys it's a radio show first video show and it's too bad too because I

284
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,720
had by net commando oh bummer but hey at least we have to play that after the show yeah all

285
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,960
right anyhow um let's get into some gaming news that's what we're here it's been a very

286
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,600
very busy week as we start to ramp up to e3 stuff is just spilling out and we have lots

287
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,240
of e3 rumors but first some facts and loki's gonna start us off with a cold hard facts

288
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:19,280
tonight fact duke nukem forever is still not out and um this isn't helping 3d realms the

289
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,580
developer of said game is actually or i should say publishing said game is no longer around

290
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:33,960
they've actually shut down and um have seats to um operate due to funding issues and apparently

291
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,960
um apogee software has also laid off all the staff that probably doesn't help the game

292
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,960
come out any sooner now when you think about it um and then on top of all that you may

293
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:51,800
not know this but um take two i was apparently financing duke nukem forever and um had invested

294
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:59,480
approximately 12 million dollars according to take two and never and according to um

295
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,120
scott miller at 3d realms of course they're saying that they never received any of that

296
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,920
money and of course the game's not done yet so now take two is actually filed a lawsuit

297
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:18,040
against um the former 3d realms members and demanding that they get their source code

298
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,440
kind of sounds like a whole lot of um stuff that was going on with uh you know scratching

299
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,080
dj hero but hopefully if they do finally turn over that source code take two the game will

300
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,400
actually be finished and you know take two makes some pretty awesome games so that could

301
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,720
be good definitely would come out a lot sooner than say 10 years or more than 10 years god

302
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,480
i don't even know how many years it is now well sorry to hear it 3d realms this has been

303
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:56,040
forever this salutes for you no that does suck because it is people's jobs and things

304
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,000
but you know this is one of those things that when it was announced i don't know about you

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,760
guys but when i heard the news i was kind of like i'm kind of surprised this didn't

306
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,980
happen sooner and i don't mean to sound like insensitive but in this economy when we've

307
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,060
seen what's been happening to studios left and right i was kind of surprised that when

308
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,480
i when i heard this news i was like oh yeah how did this studio that had a game that's

309
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,360
been in development for like 12 years survive as long as they've had you know what i mean

310
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,280
i'm just surprised that take two would keep throwing money at this you know seeing as

311
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,360
there's i mean especially since it's been like 10 years i mean come on i would think

312
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,600
it by now they would be like okay we're gonna pass this on to somebody else or well i guess

313
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,280
maybe they're just you know it's not their game so i don't know well since the word of

314
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,640
the night seems to be reboot doesn't it seem like they've rebooted duke nukem forever internally

315
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,040
several times and we've seen this game kind of develop over the years and what's weird

316
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,960
is that we've seen more media after the game was you know essentially essentially frozen

317
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,440
again here with the closing of 3d realms uh we've seen more on it now and it seems like

318
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,880
it seems that the game reinvented itself over the past few years doesn't it yeah a few times

319
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,620
that's the engines you know were being developed and so i think at one time it was running

320
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,520
on you know one of the quake engines and then you know they ran it on something else and

321
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,600
now it's on it's like something that's like unreal ish but i think it's their own engine

322
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,040
but yeah it's definitely not what it used to be and unfortunately it should have come

323
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:29,480
out a long time ago but i swear it's elvis well or tupac loki in your you know expert

324
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,560
opinion i use that term loosely what do you think do you think we're ever going to see

325
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,760
this game or is it now officially deader than a doornail we're never going to see it uh

326
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,720
no i think that we'll see this game because take two's got money and they want another

327
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,600
franchise that's going to do well and duke nukem i mean you think the last take two thing

328
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,840
that they've uh or take two game that uh published at 3d realm was a prey this is the last 3d

329
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,080
realm game that they published uh oh and that did not meet expectations either that wasn't

330
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,320
very good but at the same time i mean they actually for what it's worth i enjoyed prey

331
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,200
because prey was a great game for those of us that suck at first-person shooters because

332
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,780
of the fact that you couldn't die and actually prey was kind of epic it just felt like prey

333
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,520
ended very abruptly that was praise biggest detractor but everything leading up to that

334
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,040
point was actually pretty awesome i actually really enjoyed prey well they need to still

335
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,980
have a good first-person shooter franchise because they don't have one right now they

336
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,880
have basically your sandbox games like grand theft auto and red dead revolver those two

337
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,680
franchises they've got their sports games um you know all the 2k sports stuff and also

338
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,400
you know um if they ever do another table tennis game so you've got that but they don't

339
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,240
have a first-person shooter franchise they have their kids lines and stuff like that

340
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,120
like that um you know nickelodeon nick jr stuff but they need a good first-person shooter

341
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,240
thing and what better but you know than duke nukem i mean i think it'd be awesome if they

342
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,360
actually put out a good game and that's the problem is the expectations for are so high

343
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,120
and they want to set like this new precedent for interactivity in the game well that's

344
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,000
good but the game's got to be good also i mean and it's also got to get finished within

345
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,920
timely manner just like fable to fable to oh let's you know make this really amazing

346
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,640
ai you know the dog and all that stuff awesome that i'm glad that you did all that stuff

347
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,480
but the game was still mediocre so come on i don't know let's go to the chat room i've

348
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,360
been um totally ignoring them tonight and i really apologize chat that orange lounge

349
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,800
trader.com of course is always open when we're here uh we're just trying to get used to the

350
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,180
new setup tonight so it's taking me a little longer to get around to them however i want

351
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,160
to read this because it's something what i'm thinking too unfolded raptor in chat says

352
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,960
i heard about prey 2 and it sounded awesome and this news saddens me so come to think

353
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,240
of it that just kind of made me think oh yeah this means prey 2 is is definitely deader

354
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,000
than a doornail right because since the first one didn't do that hot well let's let's say

355
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,160
you know the whole deal with them investing money is that they get rights to this kind

356
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,600
of stuff because obviously you know it they may sell the rights to somebody else you know

357
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,960
because they're no longer around um you know and uh act f pointed out in chat room uh max

358
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,800
pain 3 is another game franchise that they have who's a third person shooter you know

359
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,560
if we're gonna draw straws here but it's not a first person shooter still very good action

360
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,440
franchise but i don't know i think that they they need something like this you know what

361
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,500
take two should do if they're gonna inherit all the rights to all these you know apogee

362
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,480
games and 3d realms they should just give us a new commander keen game how about that

363
00:23:35,480 --> 00:24:00,940
if you're gonna

364
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,480
kind of sucked, you know.

365
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,360
Dr. Sacker?

366
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,020
Well, I was actually going to try and wanted

367
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,120
to make a point earlier about them, you know,

368
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,700
with Duke Nukem Forever.

369
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,100
The other thing they're going to have going for them

370
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,740
to their advantage is, was 10 years now of coverage press

371
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,700
hype?

372
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,140
They could slap out a game that sucks

373
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,020
with the Duke Nukem Forever name on it, and it'll still sell.

374
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,940
And do you think that's what's going to happen?

375
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,220
Do you think that maybe 3D Realms was holding out

376
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,460
for the perfect game, and now Take Two maybe,

377
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,900
and I'm just theorizing here, is going to rush something

378
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,860
out the door based on whatever they get that's just going

379
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,620
to have the Duke Nukem Forever name on it,

380
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,740
just get it out there and say, finally, it's done.

381
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,620
Here, slap.

382
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,540
Well, also you've got to look at Take Two.

383
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,020
I mean, what kind of idiots were running

384
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,900
the whole process of them getting this game done?

385
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,100
Because seriously, usually they have different checkpoints

386
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,260
that they have to make before they get funding for this stuff.

387
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,300
I mean, and how could this go on for 10 years?

388
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,740
$12 million later, how could they just let it go?

389
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,300
I mean, there's got to be some sort of progress being made.

390
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,340
And the fact that over 10 years worth of work

391
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,980
and nothing's out, I'm sorry.

392
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,900
But even Grand Theft Auto IV and all these other big blockbuster

393
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,740
games only took a few years to put out, if that.

394
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,700
So come on, what the hell?

395
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,900
Get a better development team.

396
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,860
Somebody was holding out for perfection,

397
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,060
and it just never arrived.

398
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,180
I guess.

399
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:27,660
All right.

400
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,900
Well, moving on, let's go into music game worlds,

401
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,740
because it's interesting we talk about source codes

402
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,500
and legal settlements and so on, because there

403
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,740
was some interesting development in the whole Scratch

404
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,940
versus Activision versus this whole thing.

405
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,300
And what happened is that this week an LA Superior Court

406
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,380
judge ordered that the source code for Scratch

407
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,720
the Ultimate DJ must be turned over to Genius and Newmark.

408
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,500
These are the two companies that formed the Scratch the Ultimate

409
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,620
DJ LLC.

410
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,140
There was actually a company, a limited liability court,

411
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,660
formed behind this.

412
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,420
Seven Studios is, of course, now owned by Activision.

413
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,020
They are also going to have to hand over everything

414
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,880
they used to make the game.

415
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,620
Scratch LLC says they are going to finish the game,

416
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,200
and they will continue their lawsuit against Activision

417
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,980
as well.

418
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,100
But the bad news, I'm reading between the lines here,

419
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,340
nothing's been said for sure.

420
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,380
But the bad news is don't expect to see this game

421
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,740
until at least next year now, after all this, probably,

422
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,500
which is too bad.

423
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,620
Because, I mean, at that point, then we're

424
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,740
going to have DJ Hero out there as well.

425
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,220
And is it just going to be oversaturation at that point?

426
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,060
Or is there room for two, like there was room

427
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,300
for Guitar Hero and Rock Band?

428
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,100
There's room for two.

429
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,260
The only real experience I have with DJ Hero

430
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,020
is what I've been reading in Game Informer.

431
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,700
And they do kind of show how the game's

432
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,380
going to play, which is quite different than how

433
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,300
this is going to play.

434
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,340
Because Scratch plays pretty much like Beatmania,

435
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,200
but now they have a more enhanced scratching system

436
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,140
and that kind of stuff.

437
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,740
And you can do a little bit of improv.

438
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,180
But when you look at the two games, clearly,

439
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,260
and I hate to say this, clearly, DJ Hero

440
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,520
is actually kind of changing the way you play the game

441
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,700
and more innovative in that sense.

442
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,300
But I don't know.

443
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,780
I mean, yeah, it does suck.

444
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,840
But at the same time, when we first saw Guitar Hero,

445
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,300
most of us looked at it and went, eh, it's just guitar

446
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,660
freaks, but a little bit different.

447
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,100
I mean, in Scratch the Ultimate DJ,

448
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,740
we kind of look at it and go, eh, it's Beatmania,

449
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,300
but it's hip hop instead of techno music.

450
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,100
So I mean, is that necessarily a bad thing?

451
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,680
Because those first looks can be deceiving, right?

452
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,980
Because Guitar Hero ended up being a pretty awesome game.

453
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,580
Not necessarily a bad thing.

454
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,340
And they might have had a chance if they

455
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,820
could get to market first like they were planning on.

456
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,500
Because if everything had gone as planned,

457
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,980
they would be putting this game out in a couple weeks.

458
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,100
But that's not what happened.

459
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,540
So now you've got this monster of a game coming

460
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,060
from Activision that's due out in October.

461
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,620
And this game is, unless they do some serious miracle working

462
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,180
and haul some ass on getting this game done,

463
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,260
I don't think it's going to be done before it.

464
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,560
That means we're probably not going to see it at E3 either.

465
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,540
But wouldn't it be interesting if we did?

466
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,180
But I'm not going to hold my breath.

467
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,940
They were saying that they were going to have it there,

468
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,580
I thought.

469
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,740
But I don't know.

470
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,860
We'll see what happens.

471
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,900
More to develop, I'm sure.

472
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,020
It seems like some of the new is coming out

473
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,460
on this whole thing every week.

474
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,420
And E3 is just going to be kind of the climax of that.

475
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,460
Because you know DJ Hero is going to be there.

476
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,900
So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.

477
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,380
But for now, we move on.

478
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,620
And moving on to Guitar Hero 5, where there

479
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,140
have been some details released.

480
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,500
It's to be out on PS2, PS3, Wii, Xbox 360.

481
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,140
No word about new instruments yet.

482
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,980
But they say that it will allow you

483
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:51,900
to use any combination of instruments, multiple drums,

484
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,180
multiple guitars, different microphones.

485
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,140
So maybe we have a quartet mode.

486
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,420
I don't know.

487
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,460
That would be weird.

488
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,720
So if I wanted to get four singers to sing these songs,

489
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,380
I could do that.

490
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,420
They better all freaking be on pitch,

491
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,820
or I will not listen to them.

492
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,180
Four drummers, too.

493
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,140
I could just have a house full of clacking drums.

494
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,940
That'd be hilarious.

495
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,440
Interesting.

496
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,300
Yes, you could do that.

497
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:14,940
And great.

498
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,780
There's also another option for party play,

499
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,900
meaning that you can come in and out of the songs as you will.

500
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,660
So it's not going to be the, ah, dropping.

501
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,740
It'll be the, oh, they left.

502
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:40,260
There's supposed to be the music creation studio to be reworked.

503
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,780
And that you can actually trigger all of your band moments

504
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,740
when you hit parts simultaneously.

505
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,700
And there are some challenges and different things.

506
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,940
I guess they're trying to make it interesting.

507
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,140
On top of that, it will be compatible with Guitar Hero

508
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,120
World Tour.

509
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,780
And you can actually upgrade the old game

510
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,660
to use all the new enhancements in Guitar Hero 5.

511
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,620
They're supposed to also have some Johnny Cash.

512
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,540
That's the best news of all.

513
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,580
INGN0 in chat asks, could you do four singers, four guitarists,

514
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,860
and four drummers?

515
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,260
I don't think all at once.

516
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,020
Any combination of five, I think.

517
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,700
Four, maybe.

518
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,460
Well, maybe five.

519
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:28,980
I don't know.

520
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,500
I'm sorry, four.

521
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:29,900
That's right.

522
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,660
Yeah, because there's only four control slots.

523
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,380
I was looking at five.

524
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,820
I think it's a combination of four.

525
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,660
But who knows what's going to be able to be done on the internet?

526
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,820
That'd be kind of neat to have band versus band

527
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,780
at the same time.

528
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,540
Be interesting.

529
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,060
That's a lot of people, though.

530
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,020
Well, have you, well, someone did that without a game.

531
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,540
The YouTube band.

532
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,500
I haven't heard of this.

533
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
It's a page that has different embedded YouTube

534
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,820
videos of people playing chords and different passages

535
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,940
in the same key.

536
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,660
Oh, weird.

537
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,660
And you can actually play them all at once

538
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,740
or at different times.

539
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,380
And they're all harmonious.

540
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,100
It's really cool.

541
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,460
I'll try to find the link again.

542
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,060
Gotcha.

543
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,700
OK.

544
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,900
But in theory, you could have it.

545
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,420
OK.

546
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,260
Could be interesting.

547
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,180
Could be interesting.

548
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,540
I'm curious to see how this plays out.

549
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,300
But I bet you, this is just going to, you know,

550
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,700
all the YouTubes you see out there,

551
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,540
speaking of which of people playing Guitar Hero and stuff,

552
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,820
this is just going to up the craziness of those videos.

553
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,100
Because now I can just see it.

554
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,700
We're going to have the four people all singing,

555
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,580
you know, crazy, Journey or whatever.

556
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,620
Then we're going to have just people doing all the mad

557
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,900
drumming, four people at once.

558
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,580
You know you're going to see that expert, everybody in sync,

559
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,900
four people playing video.

560
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,340
It's going to be interesting.

561
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,220
I don't know.

562
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,900
But I don't know if it'll be fun.

563
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,660
That's the real question.

564
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,340
So we'll see.

565
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,900
We'll see.

566
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,500
I'm sure this will also be at E3.

567
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,580
We'll know more about it then.

568
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,740
Well, to make things even more complicated in the DJ game

569
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,620
genre, apparently there's another DJ game coming out.

570
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,220
Armin van Buuren is actually releasing a brand new game

571
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,900
on the Wii called Armin van Buuren in the mix.

572
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,140
And it's due out this fall.

573
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,380
Apparently the developer at Cloud9

574
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,820
is developing the game with him and allow

575
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,660
players to remix his music.

576
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,260
I don't know.

577
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,420
That sounds kind of cheap.

578
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,460
Well, now see, usually I would write this off.

579
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,580
I'd go, eh, it's going to be on the Wii.

580
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,980
It's probably just going to be another one of those cheesy

581
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,220
party games or whatever.

582
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,500
But dude, Armin van Buuren's actually pretty awesome.

583
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,100
So with his name behind it, and granted,

584
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,060
just because you have a big name behind it doesn't

585
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,440
mean the game's going to be good.

586
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,940
But if it's his music and stuff, it

587
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,900
has the potential to be pretty decent.

588
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,260
I mean, it's hard to say with no screenshots and no peripherals.

589
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,740
But the potential's there.

590
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,780
It's just if history has taught us anything,

591
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,380
I think a lot of us have very low expectations,

592
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,900
if you know what I mean.

593
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,020
So we'll see.

594
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,940
We'll see.

595
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,140
Yeah, and a very good point in the chat room.

596
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,140
Tiger Kala says, this is good for trance music.

597
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,380
And that's a good point, too, is that with Scratch,

598
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,060
we're looking at hip hop music.

599
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,700
With DJ Hero, we're looking at mashups.

600
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,020
Maybe this is going to be the game

601
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,200
that the Beatmania fans are drawn towards,

602
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,700
because it's more of the trancey music they're

603
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,340
used to from Beatmania.

604
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,860
Maybe.

605
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,560
With a very big question mark there.

606
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,140
Who knows?

607
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,520
A lot could happen with this game.

608
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,100
But if you think about it, for those folks that

609
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,700
are trying to find a new home, since Konami is not really

610
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,420
doing anything with 2DX in the States,

611
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,500
maybe this Armin Van Buren game is going

612
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,700
to actually be kind of cool.

613
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,700
Do you think we're going to see something like Rock Revolution

614
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,020
but coming out from the Beatmania type of thing?

615
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,100
I am actually tempted to say no, because of how horrifically

616
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Rock Revolution did.

617
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,060
But it depends.

618
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,500
If they put some new creative energy behind it,

619
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,060
it's just they're so retarded now.

620
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,180
It's like, what happened?

621
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,860
I mean, I know what happened.

622
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,860
You got rid of all the people that actually had some ideas

623
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,980
of where to take the whole Bomani genre.

624
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,540
Instead, you got rid of all of them,

625
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,620
and now you're coming out, potentially,

626
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,700
with a collection of older songs, like another Best Hits.

627
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,300
Yeah.

628
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,660
Oh, that takes some thought.

629
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,960
Oh, let's take some old songs.

630
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,580
We don't even have to do shit.

631
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,540
Let's just put it into a new game.

632
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,700
Done.

633
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,420
I'm going to go vacation for the rest of the year.

634
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
I don't know.

635
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,980
It is disappointing how the mighty

636
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,460
have fallen in terms of creativity and innovation.

637
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,460
But stranger things have happened.

638
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,020
Let's push some more Frogger games.

639
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,580
That'd be perfect.

640
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,660
Because Frogger, that's a franchise that'll never die.

641
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,700
That's gold right there.

642
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,460
Well, speaking of competition, a lot of talk

643
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,500
has come up this week about the different turntables

644
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,820
between the Scratch game and DJ Hero.

645
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,660
And what's interesting is that if you actually

646
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,860
look at the Scratch turntable, the Scratch turntable

647
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,700
looks somewhat like a BeatMania controller.

648
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,500
Of course, I hope your left side pried,

649
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,020
because that's the direction it looks like it goes.

650
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:00,460
Ah, that does flip.

651
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,100
Although, does it do it?

652
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,900
It does flip.

653
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,660
Oh, that's good.

654
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,820
But it has five keys on it.

655
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,380
But they're not staggered like you would see on a BeatMania

656
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,900
controller.

657
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,820
They're all in a row.

658
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,500
Kind of looks very much like it looks

659
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,700
like someone ripped off a Guitar Hero controller

660
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,500
and just kind of laid it next to a turntable.

661
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,300
That's what the Scratch turntable looks like.

662
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,540
So don't expect it to look the piano look of BeatMania,

663
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,380
if that makes sense.

664
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,320
It's all in a row.

665
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,820
And otherwise, it looks like there's

666
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,500
a little kind of crossfader, a little switch at the very, very

667
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,420
end as well that's going to be used in the game.

668
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,340
Kind of a bonus thing.

669
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,540
Yeah, basically, the Scratch turntable,

670
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,060
it's got a really nice made turntable.

671
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,300
It's being developed by Newmark.

672
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
The platter itself is actually the same type

673
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,820
of platter you'd find on an MP3 turntable.

674
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,400
And that's where people got confused.

675
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,540
They're all, oh, it's a real MP3 turntable.

676
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,780
I can use this as an actual turntable.

677
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,360
No, you can't use it as an actual turntable

678
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,300
for your MP3s.

679
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,380
But it's the same hardware going into it.

680
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,140
And then, of course, the buttons, as you said,

681
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,860
they're all color coded and everything.

682
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,940
Actually, I think that one is the 360 one,

683
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,220
based off of the little x in the corner.

684
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
So it has to be the 360.

685
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,060
And so it's color coded to the 360.

686
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,500
And the actual crossfader on the side

687
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,300
is basically for the scratching, for different Scratch

688
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,180
techniques.

689
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,420
So the game plays very similar beat mania type of game.

690
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,540
But the scratching itself, you can do all the Scratch

691
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,900
techniques and all the cutouts and stuff

692
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,940
like that with the crossfader.

693
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,860
That's what that's there for.

694
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,580
Now, earlier this week also, they

695
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,660
had a partial picture of the game.

696
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,580
Can I say that before you move on to DJ Hero?

697
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,120
I just want to remind folks, we talked

698
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,120
about the song list of this game a long time ago.

699
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,980
And Loki had a cutting edge first look at the game

700
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,100
before a lot of people did.

701
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,140
I just want to remind everybody, Milkshake by Kelis

702
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
is in this game.

703
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,480
It needs to come out.

704
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:52,980
That's all.

705
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,540
Potentially in this game.

706
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,020
That is all.

707
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,780
That can all change.

708
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,060
Who knows?

709
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,420
Hopefully they don't lose the licensing

710
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,460
with everything going on.

711
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,820
But come on, your Milkshake will bring all the boys to the yard

712
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,980
if this game comes out.

713
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,200
Now, the DJ Hero controller did put out

714
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,500
some pictures of what looks like the turntable platter

715
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,220
with three color buttons on it.

716
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,260
Now, the picture that went out on the internet

717
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,220
is obviously only half of what actually the controller is.

718
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,740
If you had gotten your latest copy of Game Informer magazine,

719
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,980
they actually did a six page write up on it.

720
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,180
And they actually have a picture of the full turntable

721
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,020
controller in here.

722
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,040
Of course, you've got the turntable as well with the three

723
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,660
buttons on there.

724
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,020
You've also got attached to it is a cross fader as well.

725
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,860
And there's also an effector dial and then

726
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,980
a button that's called the euphoria button,

727
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,420
or basically the overdrive or whatever that you

728
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,780
would have in Guitar Hero.

729
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,820
Now, the way the game's played, similar to Guitar Hero,

730
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,580
you're going to have your icons coming down the screen.

731
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,180
And you've got to hit them with those three buttons.

732
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,980
However, each of those buttons also represents other things.

733
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,360
The green button, which is the farthest on the left,

734
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,600
is going to be the first track.

735
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,060
So anything that you see over there

736
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,100
is going to basically be beats or whatever

737
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,700
that are part of the first track that you're mixing in.

738
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,380
The center is going to be the red, which

739
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:18,980
is also for effects and stuff that appear on both tracks.

740
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,940
It's also the cue up, I guess, your different effects

741
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,180
that you can throw in there.

742
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,620
And then finally, the blue, which is on the right,

743
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,020
is everything that's on the second song.

744
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,500
Also, the three tracks themselves

745
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,320
have other variations that are going to be coming down.

746
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,180
For example, the green on the far left,

747
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,700
you'll see that the line that follows the track basically

748
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,060
is going to shift back left and right.

749
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,560
And that's where you're going to be doing the cross-fading.

750
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,420
That's your cue to move the cross-fader, kind of like

751
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,780
if you've ever played it, Scratch or was it Crackin' DJ,

752
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,260
very similar to that.

753
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,580
And then also, they've got in the center

754
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,500
is going to cue when you or give you

755
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,000
the cue when you can do the different sound effects

756
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,100
and change your actual effector dial.

757
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,900
And then finally, the far right, the blue,

758
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,780
is going to also have your cues for scratching.

759
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,460
And I think that might also be able to go

760
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,020
on the different tracks altogether.

761
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,380
I'm not sure if it's just limited to those.

762
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,340
But basically, you have to hold down those keys

763
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,980
while you're doing the scratching, cross-fading stuff.

764
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,080
So it's a different style of gameplay

765
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,940
than, say, a Guitar Hero game or Beat Mania.

766
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,940
But it's going to have that kind of same effect.

767
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,500
And then also, all the tracks in the game

768
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,220
are all basically mash-ups, some of the examples

769
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,420
they had in here.

770
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,140
Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc. versus Marvin Gaye,

771
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,460
I heard it through the grapevine.

772
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,540
What?

773
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,220
Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers,

774
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,020
Bustin' Loose versus The Zombies, Time of the Season,

775
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,220
DJ Shadowmix, because DJ Shadow did a lot of stuff

776
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,140
in the game.

777
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,460
David Bowie, Let's Dance versus KRS-One, Jack of Spades,

778
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,380
DJ Shadowmix.

779
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,020
Nirvana, All Apologies versus Rick James, Give it to Me Baby,

780
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,260
the DJ Shadowmix.

781
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,220
What the hell?

782
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,020
This sounds crazy.

783
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,580
Tears for Fears, Shout versus Air Prayids,

784
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,500
Pean Joe or Peano.

785
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,140
Wow.

786
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,900
No, I know what you're talking about.

787
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,060
Yeah, this is a new single.

788
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,940
Yeah.

789
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,420
And then other artists, they've got

790
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,940
BC Boys Back, Blondie, and Billy Squier

791
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,260
are some other confirmed artists in there as well.

792
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,060
But yeah, the game itself, and actually, I take that back.

793
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,060
It looks like the scratching cues are on all three tracks.

794
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,100
But basically, you're going to have two sets of cues

795
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,060
that you're looking for, button presses and then

796
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,580
actions with the crossfader and stuff.

797
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,940
Just seeing how they're going to do this,

798
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm actually more excited now about DJ Hero

799
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,780
than I was Scratch.

800
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,820
Because Scratch is basically kind of a fancy beat mania,

801
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,700
but this looks a lot different.

802
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,820
And it's going to be interesting to see what

803
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,100
you're going to be able to do.

804
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,820
Also, they've got two player mode in this

805
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,060
where you can do the guitars in some of the songs.

806
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,560
And you're also going to be able to hook up a microphone to it

807
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,620
if you want to MC over everything.

808
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
Wow.

809
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,900
That sounds interesting.

810
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,540
Yeah, so very cool stuff.

811
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,340
They got the right idea with this stuff.

812
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,860
Let's see if we can get this on mic.

813
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,580
Very interesting.

814
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,980
Are you trying to get Shermie to meow on mic for us?

815
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,740
Oh, her purr?

816
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,460
I don't know what the purr will pick up.

817
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,220
That mic's probably not sensitive enough.

818
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,780
No, it's not coming through.

819
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,460
No.

820
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,580
It's not registering.

821
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,160
But we're trying to get a Shermie cameo.

822
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,380
Definitely, definitely.

823
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,780
I'd say, if anything, go to your bookstore, Barnes & Noble

824
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,740
or whatever.

825
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,140
Just pick up a copy of the new Game of War magazine

826
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,300
or just browse through it.

827
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,140
And at least check out the section

828
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,160
that they have on DJ Hero.

829
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,700
It's actually very interesting seeing

830
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,860
as they haven't shown anything really yet for it.

831
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,260
I'm sure we're going to see a lot more out of E3.

832
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,780
And I think it's going to be really fun to check out.

833
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,740
And yeah, it is another thing you've got to buy,

834
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,580
another instrument.

835
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,300
But looking at this, though, I don't

836
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,580
see how they're really going to add anything

837
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,500
to this beyond just the turntable.

838
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,760
And really, you can't play this game two player

839
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,780
with two turntables yet.

840
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,100
Maybe that's for the next game.

841
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Maybe for the next game.

842
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,020
But right now, it's just one turntable, so.

843
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,740
By the way, the chat is saying I'm on crack

844
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,000
and that they could hear the purr.

845
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,580
So there you go.

846
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,120
Sure need to make a cameo on the show.

847
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,620
Yay.

848
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,580
Although no lights came on on the mixing board,

849
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
unless I'm looking at it.

850
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,460
Yeah, I saw the move.

851
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,720
Oh, maybe I just, maybe that knob is in the way.

852
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,800
I can't see it very well.

853
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,300
Anyway.

854
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,100
You said knob.

855
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,940
Yeah, I said knob.

856
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,780
Jamie, your knob's in the way.

857
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,540
Anyway, let's move on.

858
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,500
This DJ Hero game sounds pretty cool.

859
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,920
Definitely probably one of the first things

860
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,860
we're going to check out of E3.

861
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,340
I know that.

862
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,220
One of the things, yeah, definitely.

863
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,940
OK, let's move on to some release dates.

864
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,820
Talk about some of the things that are

865
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,020
going to be coming out soon.

866
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,900
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with a trip to the UK?

867
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,700
Well, we have a few things.

868
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,900
On the 19th, Warrior Epic for PC,

869
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,180
and then a bunch of stuff for the 22nd.

870
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,100
Big Family Games on Wii, Terminator Salvation for PC,

871
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,340
UFC 2009 Undisputed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,

872
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,340
Bionic Commando for the same two, Pokemon Platinum for DS,

873
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,740
and Steel Princess.

874
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,500
Is this a typo?

875
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,980
I found a typo.

876
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,820
Why?

877
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,660
Is Steel Princess supposed to be as in the act of theft

878
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,020
or as in metal?

879
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,100
As in the act of theft.

880
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,940
OK, never mind, then it's not a typo.

881
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,620
Yeah, it's supposed to be funny, like that.

882
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,700
OK.

883
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,940
So you just, is that like kidnapping the princess,

884
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,900
or what happens there?

885
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,380
No, I think it's the princess is a thief.

886
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,700
Oh, OK, sort of like Zelda?

887
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,620
I'm going to find out.

888
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,780
Maybe.

889
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,340
That was chic.

890
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:26,820
Like chic?

891
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,380
Well, you know what I mean, same thing.

892
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:28,980
Same thing.

893
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,300
Oops, spoiler.

894
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:30,900
Oops.

895
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,580
Oh, no, I did not know that.

896
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,060
Oh, no, because I've never played Smash Bros. Brawl.

897
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,500
Interesting looking puzzle platformer.

898
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,140
Huh, all right.

899
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,260
And you can have a map maker.

900
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,220
It looks cute.

901
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,460
All right, let's move on.

902
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,500
Traveling the world, how about the US?

903
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,620
US, we've got actually quite a bit of stuff

904
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,500
coming out this week.

905
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,180
On PC, Hinterland Orc Lords.

906
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,780
Never heard of that, but could be good, maybe.

907
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,980
Puzzle Kingdoms on the Wii, that's

908
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,420
a rip off of Puzzle Quest, but it's

909
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,820
done by the same developer, so they're ripping off themselves.

910
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,340
So they're ripping off themselves.

911
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,300
Well, that's OK, right?

912
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,340
Yeah, that's all right.

913
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,060
Bionite Commando on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

914
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,300
No word on PC.

915
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,500
I can't remember if that's coming out at the same time.

916
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,460
Punch-Out this week, big game on the Wii, that'll be fun.

917
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,220
If you're into some movie games, Terminator Salvation.

918
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,820
Is it?

919
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,420
I don't know.

920
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,060
I'm a little skeptical about Punch-Out.

921
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,540
I'm sorry.

922
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,140
I'm derailing the train, but Loki, is it?

923
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,620
Do you really think it's going to be great,

924
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,580
or do you think it's going to be a little cheesy?

925
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,660
I think it's going to be about as good as the first Punch-Out.

926
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,020
I love the first Punch-Out.

927
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:38,540
Exactly.

928
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,300
And basically, they brought all the graphics up to date,

929
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,820
and they gave you the first Punch-Out again

930
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,660
with some other bells and whistles.

931
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,940
That's all right.

932
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,440
We'll see.

933
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:48,940
We'll see.

934
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,260
I'm a little skeptical.

935
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,220
I want to demo it before I buy it, that's for sure.

936
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:57,540
Terminator Salvation coming out on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC,

937
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,420
also done by the same developers as Buy It Commando.

938
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,020
Boom Blocks, Bash Party coming out on the Wii,

939
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,700
kind of a reissue there with extra puzzles.

940
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,780
Tournament Pool coming out on the Wii,

941
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,620
your generic billiards game.

942
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,180
Yu-Gi-Oh!

943
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,980
Stardust Accelerator World Championship 2009.

944
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,700
Here's what Konami's working on.

945
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,580
More Yu-Gi-Oh!

946
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,060
games.

947
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,540
EA Sports Active.

948
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,500
Hey, they sell.

949
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,260
Brand new fitness game from EA, hoping

950
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,580
to capitalize on the whole wheat fit craze.

951
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,600
Although, this does have an elastic resistance band

952
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,340
with it, so you can actually do some pretty good exercises

953
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,060
with it.

954
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,420
Thinking about getting it, but probably won't use it.

955
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,740
Jagged Alliance for the DS.

956
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,300
And talking about an old game ported over.

957
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,460
Rock Band, classic rock track pack coming out

958
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,500
on all four systems.

959
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:57,100
UFC 2009 Undisputed coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.

960
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,140
Space Camp coming out on DS and on the Wii.

961
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,900
Like the 80s movie?

962
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,740
No, not based off the 80s movie.

963
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,940
Damn it, why can't it be?

964
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,740
I know, that would be an awesome game.

965
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,940
It's just another party game from Activision, sorry.

966
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,940
You can pretend, I guess.

967
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,100
Poochie Poochie Virus coming out on Nintendo DS.

968
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,980
Is that a sexually transmitted disease?

969
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,780
I don't know.

970
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,060
Yeah.

971
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,140
Yu-Gi-Oh!

972
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,260
Don't sleep with her.

973
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,780
She's got Poochie Poochie Virus.

974
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,020
Yeah.

975
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,900
Yu-Gi-Oh!

976
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,740
It's an STD transmitted by Charo.

977
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,940
Yeah, that's what Charo got on the love boat, Poochie Poochie

978
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,460
Virus.

979
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,620
Then we've got Yu-Gi-Oh's 50s Wheelie Breaker.

980
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,620
Yes, see, this and the last game were actually

981
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,660
part of the new Yu-Gi-Oh series.

982
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,020
It's kind of extreme, so they car battle on motorcycles

983
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,900
while racing.

984
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,300
Extreme Yu-Gi-Oh if you're extremely nerdy.

985
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,020
I don't know.

986
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,340
I can't follow the Yu-Gi-Oh stuff.

987
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,180
Never gotten into the card games.

988
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,540
Party Pigs Farmyard Games.

989
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,580
Yes, it's a barnyard themed sports game

990
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,300
from Destineer who puts out all sorts of crap.

991
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,020
And it will give you swine flu.

992
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,500
It probably will.

993
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,540
This is awesome.

994
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,140
The DS, I Love Beauty.

995
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,220
How about a game called Excuse My Beauty?

996
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,580
That's the game I want to say.

997
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,900
Excuse My Beauty.

998
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,220
Excuse My Beauty, officer.

999
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,860
I'll go over to Arizona, I swear.

1000
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,420
If you haven't seen that YouTube,

1001
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,100
after you're done listening to the show tonight,

1002
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,980
please go to YouTube.

1003
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,900
Do yourself a favor and look up Excuse My Beauty.

1004
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,980
It's the funniest cops you'll ever see.

1005
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,700
And coming along with that, Imagine Makeup Artists.

1006
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,740
Awesome.

1007
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,260
And that's, of course, on the DS.

1008
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,540
Because, of course, you need to be

1009
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,540
beauty to be excused.

1010
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,340
Exactly.

1011
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,300
And then we've got some other cool stuff.

1012
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,580
The Munchables, which is coming out on the Wii.

1013
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,060
This is the game that's from Namco

1014
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,020
that's sort of like Katamari, because there's

1015
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,700
a lot of games sort of like Katamari.

1016
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,860
But you basically are an alien that's

1017
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,220
eating these food themed alien invaders.

1018
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,780
And as you eat more of them, you get bigger

1019
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,700
and you can eat bigger creatures and so on and so forth.

1020
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,620
This is kind of neat.

1021
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,980
And let's see here.

1022
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,740
Finally, oh, actually, that's it.

1023
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,260
Great.

1024
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,700
Let's move on to Japan now and talk about the Japanese release

1025
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,540
dates, where I mispronounce the release names horribly.

1026
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,540
Yay.

1027
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,180
Actually, this one will be easy, though.

1028
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,740
Mass Effect, I can pronounce that.

1029
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,940
That comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.

1030
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,360
That would be the localized version

1031
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,020
of Mass Effect, which, of course, came out here

1032
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,180
quite a while ago.

1033
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,000
But they've taken some time to make

1034
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,220
it special for the Japanese.

1035
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,700
And that will finally be making its way out this week.

1036
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,160
If you're a PlayStation 3 owner, not a lot for you,

1037
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,020
except UFC 2009, undisputed, will make its way

1038
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,140
to Asian regions, at least, as does Bionic Commando,

1039
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,380
but not technically a Japanese release.

1040
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,980
You don't get anything on the PlayStation 3 in Japan

1041
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,900
locally until next week.

1042
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,180
But on the Nintendo Wii, you have Tact of Magic

1043
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,180
is a game you have to look forward to.

1044
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,460
It is coming out from Nintendo themselves,

1045
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,940
is the game.

1046
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,300
It is looking to be some type of RPG.

1047
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,980
I'm not sure if it's something else.

1048
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,260
It doesn't look like it's based off an anime or anything.

1049
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,140
I'm not sure if that's something else here.

1050
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,260
Not familiar to you, Loki?

1051
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,660
The artwork does not look familiar.

1052
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,620
I don't know if it's a new IP or what.

1053
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,340
But that is coming out on the Wii from Nintendo, Tact of Magic.

1054
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,140
But it may not be an anime right now.

1055
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:29,540
Doesn't mean they won't become an anime later on.

1056
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,960
Somebody in the chat room may be able to enhance on that.

1057
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,300
Nothing on the PlayStation 2.

1058
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,940
Either.

1059
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,700
However, the Nintendo DS does see a few releases this week,

1060
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,980
including Happy Star Band comes out this week,

1061
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,100
as well as some new cases and things for the DS

1062
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,420
if that's something you're into.

1063
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,820
Another simple DS game this time, series number 48.

1064
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,300
Wow.

1065
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,220
And then, let's see.

1066
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:57,100
Also, Ora ga Ome o Mamoru comes out this week

1067
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,300
from Idea Factory, which is an action game.

1068
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,860
Something like Protecting Something?

1069
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,260
I Will Protect You is the English translation

1070
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,700
of that game.

1071
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,860
Comes out this week.

1072
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,180
Lastly, looking at the PSP, it looks

1073
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,260
to be kind of a slow week.

1074
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,940
I don't know if we're getting anything on the PSP this week.

1075
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,180
Well, you do get SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.

1076
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,320
And Space Invaders Extreme gets a price cut.

1077
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,820
So that's some good news on the PSP.

1078
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,740
I bet some folks might even import that SNK Classic 1 that

1079
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,660
has King of Fighters 94, King of Monsters, Metal Slug,

1080
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,180
Last Resort.

1081
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,540
I would hope not, since it's already come out.

1082
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,620
So there you go.

1083
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,860
Well, there might be at least.

1084
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,140
We have a couple listeners in Japan.

1085
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,220
Maybe they're going to pick that up for their local version.

1086
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,020
We'll see.

1087
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,660
There you go.

1088
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:42,660
That's what's coming out in Japan.

1089
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,940
Let's get back into some gaming news

1090
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,140
before we get to the end of part A

1091
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,600
with the classic game of the week.

1092
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,300
But first, some news.

1093
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,400
Dark Sakura has some exciting news, right?

1094
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,060
Well, there is an issue of Nintendo Power

1095
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:59,340
Out that's saying that a particular game that a lot

1096
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,860
of people have been importing is going to be coming out

1097
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,820
in the US, and that is Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

1098
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:12,380
The issue is saying that it is definitely headed out

1099
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,260
that Capcom has been attempting to bring it out

1100
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,820
to North America.

1101
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,860
But I'm still sort of, I mean, then again,

1102
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,140
it's Nintendo's official magazine.

1103
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:21,940
Wait, wait, wait.

1104
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,460
Nintendo Power, what's that?

1105
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,540
I've never heard of Nintendo Power.

1106
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,700
That sounds fake.

1107
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,040
Well, maybe people are thinking it's a Photoshop picture.

1108
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,700
But I mean, this is going to be proven or disproven

1109
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,660
in a couple days when the issue actually comes out, right?

1110
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,220
Yeah, I mean, we'll find out for sure.

1111
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,620
In fact, it says it's page 46.

1112
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,260
So look and see if it's page 46.

1113
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,300
I'm looking this over, by the way,

1114
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,660
just with a very critical eye.

1115
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:53,500
And let me see if I can't make this a little bit larger.

1116
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Well, I mean, what was preventing

1117
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
the game from coming out here in the first place?

1118
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,180
Licensing, right?

1119
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,660
Because the licensing in the America

1120
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,060
lies with all these different companies.

1121
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,580
But if they see the demands there,

1122
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,920
they're going to let it come out.

1123
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,660
Do you think, though, maybe some characters might get cut?

1124
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,780
Maybe that's the sacrifice that'll be made.

1125
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,260
That would be unfortunate.

1126
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,660
Let's hope not.

1127
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,900
I don't know.

1128
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,140
From looking at this, it doesn't really

1129
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,780
look very Photoshopped to me because of the way

1130
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,340
that the glare.

1131
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:25,340
The glare on this is far too uniform to be.

1132
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,540
It's either expertly Photoshopped or it's real.

1133
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,940
I think it's the real deal, but we

1134
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,940
need to be prepared for the fact that some of these characters

1135
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,980
might be cut.

1136
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,860
But that could be good news for some people

1137
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,700
because that means they might get

1138
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,500
replaced with additional Capcom characters.

1139
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,220
Who knows?

1140
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,720
I mean, I think we should be prepared to see the character

1141
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,660
roster possibly shift slightly.

1142
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,860
But we'll see, right?

1143
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,500
That we will.

1144
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,500
But I'm honestly putting my money on this being legit.

1145
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,020
Good.

1146
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,740
And now I have to import it.

1147
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,580
Hooray.

1148
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,340
It's too bad this isn't coming out instead.

1149
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,980
What's that?

1150
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,140
Someone's photoshopped Kellogg's versus Capcom.

1151
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,140
The new age of breakfast.

1152
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,940
I've seen that.

1153
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,700
Now that would be a game I'd like to play.

1154
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,380
That would be a lot of fun.

1155
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,180
I would play that.

1156
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:05,980
That was all right.

1157
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,020
Tony the Tiger would throw down.

1158
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,740
Snap, Crackle, Pop would do like a team attack.

1159
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,140
Anyway, moving on.

1160
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,920
Moving on.

1161
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,500
Some other interesting things.

1162
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,300
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1163
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,140
Can I say that real quick?

1164
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:18,300
Yeah.

1165
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,020
But you said this before the show tonight, Loki.

1166
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,900
We were actually talking about this Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

1167
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,700
You said maybe this is something Nintendo

1168
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,580
was trying to keep under wraps until E3 to go, see,

1169
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,380
core gamers, we heart you.

1170
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,260
I'm sure it was.

1171
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,220
But as all things with E3, they never stay under wraps.

1172
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,700
Because if you tell somebody, they'll

1173
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,420
tell somebody untrustworthy.

1174
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,060
Like us.

1175
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,260
Yes.

1176
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,540
Hey, except we're trustworthy sometimes.

1177
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,660
When we want to be, yeah.

1178
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,180
When we want to be.

1179
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,780
Anyways, Pokemon Gold and Silver are being remade.

1180
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:54,860
And that's not a huge surprise.

1181
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,860
But yeah.

1182
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,380
No time frame, I guess, other than the fact

1183
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,660
that it's supposed to be in Japan this fall

1184
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,580
and probably coming out here sometime in the spring.

1185
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,380
If I remember correctly, the last two games we had it,

1186
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:14,340
like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Time,

1187
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,780
and I forget the other one was.

1188
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:21,660
Anyways, those were both around April, so that'd be spring.

1189
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,300
I don't know.

1190
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,260
Pokemon's just not my thing.

1191
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,380
It's just really not.

1192
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,100
I think I'm out of the age bracket for that.

1193
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,580
I'm kind of over it, but I'm a little disappointed

1194
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,820
it's yet another remake.

1195
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,460
I don't know.

1196
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,620
I would kind of like to see one of these games on the Wii.

1197
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,580
Have you run out of ideas?

1198
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,100
I mean.

1199
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,180
I would like to see one of these games on the Wii.

1200
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,460
And I understand Pokemon was born as a handheld

1201
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,700
or what have you, but I don't know.

1202
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,980
Or just give us a Pokemon MMO already.

1203
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,940
I mean, Pokemon was born to be an MMO.

1204
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,180
Couldn't it?

1205
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,540
Maybe I'm crazy.

1206
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,500
I don't know.

1207
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,700
Anyhow, moving on, another game that I guess some were born

1208
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,500
to play on the Nintendo Wii, Contra.

1209
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,220
It's a brand new version of Contra called Contra Rebirth.

1210
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,300
And if you're in Japan, this game already came out.

1211
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,700
It came out on May 12.

1212
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,500
It was released in Japan for $10.

1213
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,860
It's awesome.

1214
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,700
Have you heard?

1215
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,580
I haven't heard.

1216
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,080
Tell us a little bit what the game's like.

1217
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,780
No, it's awesome.

1218
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,700
It's very 16-bit Contra-ish, but they've

1219
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,660
got a bunch of crazy ass levels in there.

1220
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,340
Like there's one where you're skydiving

1221
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:31,180
on parts of a broken spaceship and stuff

1222
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,500
like that, fighting monsters, and all the typical stuff

1223
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,100
that you would see in a Super Nintendo Contra game.

1224
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,660
But awesome.

1225
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,580
Well, the game does have co-op, just like the original Contra,

1226
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:44,860
but no word yet on when it's going to come out over here

1227
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,060
on this side of the ocean.

1228
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,700
But I would imagine it's going to come out soon.

1229
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,140
Probably just a little bit of localizing time.

1230
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,020
Going to chat for some comments, Tora is in chat tonight

1231
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,280
and is commenting on the Pokemon story, saying,

1232
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,980
Rob, the creators already said Pokemon will never be an MMO.

1233
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,260
Well, you know what?

1234
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,860
Never say never.

1235
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,420
Yeah, pass enough money their way,

1236
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,820
and they'll be like, whatever.

1237
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,420
Exactly.

1238
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,300
Just like, didn't everybody say just a few weeks ago,

1239
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,580
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom would never come out in the US, right?

1240
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,100
Never say never.

1241
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,500
But I mean, I get the point.

1242
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,420
But you know, where there's money.

1243
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,420
Didn't they also say there'd never be another Katamari game?

1244
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,460
Yeah, we saw how long that lasted.

1245
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,500
So we'll see.

1246
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,300
Technically, it's not new.

1247
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:27,940
I get it.

1248
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,700
It's a snowball's chance in hell.

1249
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,200
But there's a chance.

1250
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,980
There's a chance.

1251
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,100
Just a few more stories for you guys

1252
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,020
before we get to a little break here tonight.

1253
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,100
But first, our Sakura.

1254
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Do we get to break things?

1255
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,140
Actually, no, not in my house.

1256
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,380
Actually, we're at your house.

1257
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,460
So yeah, tonight we can.

1258
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,060
Let's start with the Dalek up there.

1259
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:49,940
No.

1260
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,440
See?

1261
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,940
Stop.

1262
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,980
That's our new mascot, by the way, is Dalek Sec.

1263
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,060
Because the ferret's at the OLR Studios, so.

1264
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,660
See?

1265
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,180
Anyway.

1266
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,820
Oh, god.

1267
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,740
Doesn't quite have the charm of the ferret.

1268
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:16,620
Not quite as charming as the ferret.

1269
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,540
I had to.

1270
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,220
Kind of annoying.

1271
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,260
I kind of wish I could be exterminated for real.

1272
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,140
Anyway.

1273
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:26,220
So new game coming out for the iPhone, which makes me happy

1274
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,620
because it's one of my favorites,

1275
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,460
and I have to think about getting it now,

1276
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:32,220
is Dick Doug Remix.

1277
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,780
It is out for $5.99 on the iTunes App Store.

1278
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:42,100
And you have a D-pad and a flick mode.

1279
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,620
The flick will let you fling dirt around

1280
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,700
by flicking your finger on the screen and what?

1281
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,100
I'm just laughing at the concept of taking dirt around

1282
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,100
with your finger.

1283
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,860
Now with enhanced moving dirt technology.

1284
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,780
And you have enhanced shovels so you

1285
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,700
can dig faster and balloon blocks to protect you

1286
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,180
from falling rocks.

1287
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,820
And hey, it looks pretty fun.

1288
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:13,460
It's definitely got big air pumping power.

1289
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,860
So yay.

1290
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:19,340
The chat room is commenting on the Dalek being a new mascot.

1291
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,380
Brad from Pod Culture is suggesting

1292
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,940
Capcom versus Dalek versus ferret.

1293
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,980
And Act F adds on to that versus Clicky.

1294
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,340
So somebody needs to hit up Mujin quick.

1295
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,060
We'll just dump Shermie on them and they'll all die.

1296
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:33,620
All right.

1297
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,380
Shermie will cute them to death.

1298
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,100
He'll purr them to death.

1299
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,380
All right, moving on.

1300
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,540
Loki, what do you got for us?

1301
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,860
Well, I've got some interesting information.

1302
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,500
Of course, right around the corner, we've got BlizzCon.

1303
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,100
And I really heard this week tickets went on sale.

1304
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,700
And of course, they sell out very fast.

1305
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,660
And this probably is not helping slow that down any.

1306
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,780
But Blizzard has confirmed that the special pet

1307
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,700
you will get for attending BlizzCon

1308
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:10,340
will be the Grunty the Marine Murloc.

1309
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,620
Yes, it's Murloc dressed up like one of the Space

1310
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,300
Marines from StarCraft.

1311
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,100
And there are people that will pay lots of money for it.

1312
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,660
Yes, in fact, some of the tickets

1313
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,980
have already gone out on eBay already,

1314
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,380
which is not a surprise.

1315
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,700
And hopefully you were there early

1316
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,020
to get your tickets for the first round

1317
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,780
because they sold out within 30 minutes.

1318
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,820
I didn't talk to Extifer.

1319
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,940
I didn't see if he got his ticket.

1320
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,300
I know he was trying to go.

1321
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,660
I don't think he's going to go.

1322
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,220
He said he didn't want it because the tickets are $125

1323
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:40,500
now.

1324
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,020
Oh, dang.

1325
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,580
Wow.

1326
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,460
Yeah.

1327
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,500
And he was trying to get me to go.

1328
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,020
But he doesn't want me to go to Penny Arcade Expo.

1329
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,640
He says I should go to BlizzCon instead.

1330
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,820
But dude, Seattle.

1331
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:55,140
And Penny Arcade Expo is kind of awesome.

1332
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,060
BlizzCon's too limiting for me.

1333
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,340
But if you can't afford to go to BlizzCon

1334
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:01,540
and you don't get a ticket, you can, however,

1335
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,660
for the first time, watch the event on DirecTV

1336
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,900
or online for $39.99.

1337
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,300
So I should pay an additional $40 to the company.

1338
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,540
I'm already paying $15 a month too.

1339
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,540
Hey, well, if you want to see all the stuff that

1340
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,660
will be covered probably on other press sites.

1341
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,300
It will be on the internet in 30 seconds

1342
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:21,740
after it's on this channel.

1343
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,580
Wow Insider, one of those wow sites.

1344
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,660
There's a billion of them out there.

1345
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,740
Not even 30 seconds.

1346
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,260
They will be live blogging that shit.

1347
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,300
Have you ever noticed that all the top podcasts right now

1348
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,100
on iTunes, like if you look at gaming, almost half of them

1349
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,780
are Warcraft podcasts.

1350
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,580
I'm like, dude, if we wanted to be super famous,

1351
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,320
we'd just talk about Warcraft all the time.

1352
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,780
Because that's apparently what makes

1353
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,020
you popular on the internet.

1354
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,940
Just kind of surprised me.

1355
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,240
I thought it would be way too saturated for Warcraft podcasts.

1356
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,380
But they do very well.

1357
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,620
Which, by the way, reminds me, be kind.

1358
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,940
Rate us a five in iTunes.

1359
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,380
They have a new rating system now.

1360
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,780
Even if you've written a review for the show,

1361
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,220
you can go back and rate the show five stars.

1362
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,500
And by the way, thanks so much to those

1363
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,620
that have already done it.

1364
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,580
Because we are on page one right now of the podcast.

1365
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,100
That makes us very happy.

1366
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,700
Because word of mouth's all we got

1367
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,940
to spread the word of the show.

1368
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,220
So that's all we ask.

1369
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,900
Thank you.

1370
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,860
So let's see.

1371
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:17,700
Tora, by the way, in chat is mentioning something

1372
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:22,620
about Nintendo Power and the whole Capcom vs. Tatsunoko

1373
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:23,140
thing.

1374
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:23,860
Let me read this.

1375
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,900
My ex has scans of the Nintendo Power talking

1376
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,660
about Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.

1377
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,140
There's three characters missing from the roster.

1378
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,420
Two of them don't have licensing over here in the States.

1379
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,060
He's sending them to me now, ha ha.

1380
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,580
So that doesn't surprise me at all.

1381
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,840
That's kind of what we were saying earlier,

1382
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,380
is that prepare that there might be some roster changes.

1383
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,700
But they'll try to sell it to you.

1384
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,780
They'll add more stuff back in.

1385
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,420
We'll see.

1386
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,660
We'll see.

1387
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:46,380
OK.

1388
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,980
Anyhow, so BlizzCon.

1389
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:48,820
Yeah, I don't know.

1390
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,320
I think I'm going to pass this year in favor of just reading

1391
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,360
about it on the internet.

1392
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,940
There's $125 for a pet or even $40 for the pet.

1393
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,660
No, thank you.

1394
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,420
I mean, wow is cool and all, but it's not that cool.

1395
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,020
Also, what is that cool?

1396
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,100
You know who is that cool?

1397
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,100
Steve Weeby.

1398
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,100
He is that cool.

1399
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,060
And some companies are willing to pay more than $40

1400
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,260
in the name of Steve Weeby.

1401
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,780
In fact, Stride Gum apparently is

1402
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:21,060
going to be spending $10,001 in quarters.

1403
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:24,980
That's a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum,

1404
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,180
is their little tagline for Stride Gum,

1405
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,300
if Steve Weeby accomplishes the task

1406
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,540
of taking over the Donkey Kong world record at this year's E3.

1407
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,700
So apparently, what's going to happen,

1408
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,140
the reward will be paid.

1409
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:41,980
If Weeby does beat Billy Mitchell's record score,

1410
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,060
then apparently Stride is going to provide him

1411
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:48,340
with a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum

1412
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,780
and $10,001 in quarters.

1413
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,460
Huh.

1414
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,620
So I have the names of the people cut

1415
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,500
from Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

1416
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,940
Oh, who's that?

1417
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,860
It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.

1418
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:07,940
Hm, there they are.

1419
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,100
Well, you know, again, it was probably a licensing thing,

1420
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,900
but does this mean maybe Capcom characters will replace them

1421
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,420
or just get used to it?

1422
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,700
I didn't hear who.

1423
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,860
I said Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.

1424
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,060
So what are you QQing about over there, Darusakura?

1425
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,820
Dude, Joe's awesome.

1426
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:31,580
All right, more to come on the whole King of Kong debacle,

1427
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,100
which still goes on to this day at E3.

1428
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,980
But for now, more news.

1429
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,540
There's a game that I have been banging myself in the head

1430
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,140
over trying to make myself understand and remember

1431
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,620
that much Japanese to be able to play it properly.

1432
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,220
And I've kind of hit an impasse.

1433
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,580
But Ragnarok DS.

1434
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:53,100
Well, thankfully, I won't have to give myself a migraine

1435
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,260
every time I try to play it.

1436
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,020
And it's a fun game, don't get me wrong.

1437
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,540
I love it.

1438
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,420
I'm all like, yeah.

1439
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:05,180
But XSeed is having a match-up with Gung Ho Works

1440
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,780
to bring Ragnarok Online DS out in the winter.

1441
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,460
So that makes me happy.

1442
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,980
Pourings for all, yay.

1443
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,020
I just know the first town you have to go

1444
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,940
is Prontera, just to let you know.

1445
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,980
But I love the game.

1446
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,100
And especially for people who, like me,

1447
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,580
have been playing RO for like ever.

1448
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,300
Addict.

1449
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,100
I haven't touched the game in a month and a half, Rob.

1450
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,580
I haven't touched WoW a lot lately.

1451
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,540
You'd be proud of me.

1452
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,180
Well, I've just been so busy.

1453
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,660
It's not that I don't want to play WoW.

1454
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,340
I just kind of had other stuff going on.

1455
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,700
I've had way too much to do.

1456
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:42,740
But the whole part of the game, the story of the game

1457
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:47,500
is that you play a guy named Ares, who meets this girl.

1458
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,580
And she's a job class that does not exist in the game at all.

1459
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,900
But she's there.

1460
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,980
And you have to, she's lost her memory.

1461
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,140
And you have to help her, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1462
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,300
You can change the rest of your job and everything.

1463
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:08,020
But it's pretty much RPG with RO flavor.

1464
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,180
Now, Death Wishing in Chat at chat.orangetraday.com,

1465
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,940
live on this Sunday night, is sharing

1466
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:15,780
that he could never get into Ragnarok.

1467
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,180
Because there was no quest, and he likes quest-based MMOs.

1468
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,540
So does this DS game kind of add the whole quest element?

1469
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:22,940
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

1470
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,020
They're not being quests.

1471
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,340
Because there's quests aplenty in RO.

1472
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,500
Is that something they added later?

1473
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,780
Because it seems like when I was playing like years ago,

1474
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,300
they didn't have them.

1475
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,740
Rob, you were playing with me in the beta.

1476
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,020
I know.

1477
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:34,740
It was years ago.

1478
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,100
So they have them now, though.

1479
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,940
Yeah, dude, there's even a quest.

1480
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,980
And it's like a really simple, easy, stupid quest

1481
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,980
where you get a bajillion experience points just

1482
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,180
for doing it.

1483
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:47,100
And you've got the ones that give you experience points,

1484
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,780
the ones questing for items.

1485
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,180
Especially the questing for items,

1486
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,060
that's how you get some of the really rare crap in the game.

1487
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:56,420
I have to admit, there's a tiny, tiny part of me,

1488
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,940
just very, very tiny, but a tiny, tiny part of me

1489
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,940
that kind of wants to go back and check out RO.

1490
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:01,940
Play on the server I play on.

1491
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,500
But there's also a tiny, tiny part of me

1492
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,220
that wants to do the same for Final Fantasy XI.

1493
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,420
Play on the server I play on.

1494
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,220
But I also know my guildies in WoW

1495
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,700
would kill me in the face if I did something like that.

1496
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,580
And I don't want to be killed in the face.

1497
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,460
Play Ragnarok with me.

1498
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,420
It's free.

1499
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:14,940
We'll see.

1500
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:15,580
Play on the server I play on.

1501
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,620
We'll see.

1502
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,940
I don't have time for more crack right now.

1503
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:20,380
I'm a busy boy.

1504
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:20,900
We'll see.

1505
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,100
Maybe after E3 when things settle down a little bit.

1506
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,380
We'll see.

1507
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,340
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.

1508
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,740
Then we got the Classic Game of the Week coming up.

1509
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,740
Well, the Classic Game Flashback is now

1510
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:36,700
available on the App Store for your iPhone or iPod Touch.

1511
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:40,620
However, there's something a little interesting about it.

1512
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,260
The game itself is $4.99.

1513
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:48,100
And it's basically a port of the Amiga version.

1514
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:53,460
However, apparently Pocket Gamer has done a report on the game.

1515
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,260
And they said that basically you're paying for an emulator.

1516
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:01,940
And then the ROM is downloaded independently

1517
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,700
using the emulator, I guess.

1518
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:08,140
And so because of that, it's not exactly designed for the iPhone.

1519
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,940
And it's kind of wonky as far as the controls go.

1520
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,020
Uh-oh.

1521
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,180
Another Mega Man 2.

1522
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,460
Yeah, I was going to say, sadly, there's

1523
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,660
been a couple of those on the iPhone,

1524
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,620
hasn't there, where there have been emulators.

1525
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:20,740
Not just on the iPhone.

1526
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,500
You kind of get the sense that maybe on Xbox Live

1527
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,260
you get a lot of that too, where it's just

1528
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:27,740
you're basically paying $5 for an emulator in the ROM.

1529
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,420
Well, hell, that is what you're paying for on the Wii.

1530
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,620
But it's a little different.

1531
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,700
Because Nintendo put out the Wii and Nintendo

1532
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,540
put out all those games.

1533
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,820
So a little different.

1534
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,780
Anyhow, one more story for you guys.

1535
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,980
And it has to do with a really funny guy.

1536
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,780
I don't know if you ever watched The Soup, which is a show on E,

1537
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,880
but it's awesome.

1538
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,540
It's hosted by a guy named Joel McHale, who's pretty funny.

1539
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,580
And yes, this does tie into video games.

1540
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,680
Because Joel McHale is apparently

1541
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,100
going to be giving the Ubisoft press conference this year

1542
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,420
at E3.

1543
01:07:57,420 --> 01:07:58,380
Interesting.

1544
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:02,100
He also was appearing live in LA that same week.

1545
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,740
Oh, funny.

1546
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,140
On the 6th.

1547
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,900
Or wait, wherever that Friday is.

1548
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,820
Well, I'm sure that show tapes in LA too.

1549
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,860
So it's probably just roll out of bed and into the show

1550
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,140
for him, you know what I mean?

1551
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,420
So that's pretty cool, though, that he's

1552
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,980
going to be doing that E3.

1553
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,560
Apparently, you will be able to watch the whole thing yourself

1554
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,220
the next day.

1555
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,420
It will be available on Ubisoft's website.

1556
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,260
That's pretty cool.

1557
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,180
I plan on doing it.

1558
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,060
Absolutely.

1559
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,500
If we can't get tickets in person,

1560
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,380
because they hating on the independent media.

1561
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,820
I think that's actually the day before I arrive.

1562
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,580
Oh, bummer.

1563
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,540
Bummer, bummer.

1564
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,140
All right, it's time.

1565
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,140
We're finally going to get into the classic video

1566
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:37,800
game of the week.

1567
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,100
That's right.

1568
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,760
We'd like to take some time on the show

1569
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,900
every week to dig into the archives.

1570
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,140
And Dark Soccer digs into her vault.

1571
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:47,180
And now I have seen the vault. It's a very impressive vault.

1572
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,900
And she pulls out one game that she

1573
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,780
thinks you guys should pay some respect to.

1574
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:54,340
So it's time to pay me tribute.

1575
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,180
Pay her tribute.

1576
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:56,420
Pay her classic game tribute.

1577
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:57,380
The classic of the week.

1578
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,540
What should the kids be playing this week, Dark Soccer?

1579
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,580
Pac-Man.

1580
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,980
Well, now that's a classic.

1581
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:04,220
Yeah.

1582
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:06,780
And actually, it was suggested to me by Sauce.

1583
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:10,900
So I thought it was actually very, very, very a good one

1584
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,560
to put in there.

1585
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,940
And really, a whole year plus of doing this segment,

1586
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,300
and you've never done Pac-Man.

1587
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:15,820
Amazing.

1588
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:16,320
Nope.

1589
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,100
This is Pac-Man.

1590
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,300
Basically, if you don't know how to play Pac-Man,

1591
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,420
then you've been living with your head under the dirt

1592
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,900
forever.

1593
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,020
For decades.

1594
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,140
Basically, it's a maze game.

1595
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,860
You play as a little circular guy

1596
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,300
who runs around eating dots.

1597
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,980
And he's chased by ghosts.

1598
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:42,020
And if you eat a big dot, you can chase the ghost.

1599
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,100
Did you get Chermey to talk?

1600
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,140
Hey, baby.

1601
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:47,900
Hey, radio.

1602
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,400
Not kiddie.

1603
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,460
Yeah, Chermey on mic now.

1604
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,980
So anyway, really what I wanted to bring up

1605
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:57,140
about this is the Pac-Man franchise,

1606
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,140
which has gone kablooey.

1607
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:07,380
Also, it is possible to get a perfect game of Pac-Man,

1608
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,260
but it was only done by the world's biggest asshole, Billy

1609
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:13,100
Mitchell.

1610
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:19,860
And there also was an eight-year-old boy

1611
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:25,180
who, in 1982, made it through the split screen level, which

1612
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:32,340
is basically what happens when it basically gets over more

1613
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,700
than what the memory of the game can handle,

1614
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,500
because it just basically recalculates every time

1615
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,160
it goes through.

1616
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,820
So the game was actually made by Namco, brought up

1617
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:45,500
by Midway in America.

1618
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,060
And the way that the name of the game

1619
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:55,580
came around was from a Japanese phrase, paku paku taberu.

1620
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:58,820
Paku paku is the sound the mouth makes

1621
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:03,820
when open and closed right away.

1622
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,020
I never do that.

1623
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:11,100
So basically, and taberu is to eat.

1624
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,860
So basically, the character is supposed

1625
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:16,780
to sort of look like pizza, missing a piece.

1626
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:26,180
So as it came out, it went kind of meh in Japan.

1627
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:29,420
But when Midway grabbed it over here,

1628
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,780
it was totally, totally, totally explosive.

1629
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:33,820
It went crazy.

1630
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:36,180
And everyone liked it, because all they really had before

1631
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,620
was Space Invaders, that realm.

1632
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,580
Yeah, the music's getting a little monotonous here.

1633
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,180
So I thought maybe we could switch it up a little bit,

1634
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:49,100
and I'll play something else for the Classic Game of the Week

1635
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:49,620
here.

1636
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,780
Well, we can play a little bit of background music here.

1637
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:01,580
OK, anyway.

1638
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:08,060
So also, since Pac-Man made it really, really happy over here,

1639
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,420
that also we're able to bring out a few other games,

1640
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,460
like Rally-X. And Pac-Man actually

1641
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:20,660
even surpassed Asteroids as the best-selling arcade

1642
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:25,540
game of all time when it was released.

1643
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:30,140
So basically, we can just say that Pac-Man was,

1644
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:35,820
I want to say, the game that really propelled video games

1645
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:38,020
more closer to the mainstream, apart from just

1646
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,700
being something for kids.

1647
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,020
I remember being little and seeing adults playing it.

1648
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:45,100
I remember playing Pac-Man on roller skates.

1649
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,060
Yes, Pac-Man on roller skates.

1650
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,100
I remember roller skating to this song

1651
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,060
that's playing in the background right now.

1652
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,100
That was hardcore.

1653
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,980
Well, also, I have somewhere in the vault,

1654
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,180
or actually not in the vault, in the garage, a Pac-Man plushie

1655
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,540
with the little ghost in his mouth

1656
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:04,380
wearing a t-shirt and everything that came out in the 80s.

1657
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,820
You know, I had Pac-Man glasses, the glasses

1658
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,740
that they had at Burger King, or was it?

1659
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,540
You remember those?

1660
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,380
I had the Pac-Man board game.

1661
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,420
I remember that.

1662
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,100
And I seem to recall there was Pac-Man cereal,

1663
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,500
if I'm not mistaking.

1664
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,740
And I'm pretty sure I had that, too.

1665
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,340
Well, I'll tell you something else

1666
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,060
that this might be interesting.

1667
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:25,340
In Japan, it was actually called Pac-Man.

1668
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,540
And they changed it to Pac-Man because they

1669
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:30,420
were afraid that vandals were going to change the P to an F,

1670
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,100
so it would be Pac-Man.

1671
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,740
That's awesome.

1672
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,940
You can still find Pac-Man.

1673
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:36,980
I'm not sure they did in ROMs somewhere.

1674
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:37,480
Sure.

1675
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,500
You can still find Pac-Man machines in Europe,

1676
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,380
apparently.

1677
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,420
I want a Pac-Man machine.

1678
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:49,620
Now, let's go ahead and talk about sequels.

1679
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:51,140
Well, actually, the different ports.

1680
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:55,940
There was the Apple II series, Atari 2600, Atari 5200,

1681
01:13:55,940 --> 01:14:00,340
the 8-bit computers, IBM, the early IBM PC, and television

1682
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:02,420
Commodore 64 NES.

1683
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:05,340
On handheld, we had Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket

1684
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,500
Color, which I have.

1685
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,700
Actually, I've got so many versions of this damn game.

1686
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,940
Christ, it's only a three-hour show, you know.

1687
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,900
There were just all the different versions.

1688
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,940
And, of course, we have them all in the Namco Museum,

1689
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,020
Xbox Live Arcade.

1690
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,420
We've got the Championship Edition.

1691
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:29,900
My favorite to this date is the one on GameCube.

1692
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,820
Hi, baby.

1693
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,740
Sorry, it's my cat.

1694
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:37,740
Where you play as the ghost.

1695
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,580
Stop trying to get your cats to talk during the segment.

1696
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:43,380
Where you play as the ghost trying to catch Pac-Man.

1697
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:44,620
That one was pretty fun.

1698
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:49,540
So, since then, and by the way, I love the little flashing

1699
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:53,460
thing on this article, because the Atari 2600 version sucked.

1700
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,260
Sucked.

1701
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,580
Sorry.

1702
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,340
Yeah, I do have it.

1703
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,620
Sequels.

1704
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,180
Dude, do we have spin-offs and sequels?

1705
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:07,580
We have Ms. Pac-Man, which Ms. Pac-Man was great.

1706
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:10,940
Um, Super Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, Junior Pac-Man, Pac and

1707
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,620
Pal, Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp.

1708
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,900
I think Chomp Chomp was his dog, wasn't it?

1709
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,460
We have Professor Pac-Man, which was an unauthorized one

1710
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:19,860
that Midway created.

1711
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:26,820
Pac-Land, which I've actually got on the PC Engine duo.

1712
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,940
By the way, this is for you, DarkSakura.

1713
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,820
This is just for you here.

1714
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:31,420
If I can get to it.

1715
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,300
Is it a 7-Up commercial?

1716
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,940
No.

1717
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,060
Even worse.

1718
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,980
Far worse.

1719
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:41,140
Oh, fuck.

1720
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,740
That's the Atari 2600 version.

1721
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,420
Has everybody's ears bleed?

1722
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:49,860
We had Pac-Mania, which is actually a really, really good

1723
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:50,980
follow-up game.

1724
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,900
Pac-Man VR, Pac-Man Arrangement, which was in the

1725
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,780
Namco Classics Volume 2.

1726
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:01,540
Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga Class of 81, Pac and Party.

1727
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,140
Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Frogger Classic Combo, Pac-Man 25th

1728
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,060
Anniversary, and then Pinball.

1729
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:09,220
We had Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man, which was created specifically

1730
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:09,900
by Midway.

1731
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,740
And we had Baby Pac-Man, another unauthorized one,

1732
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:16,340
which is a game I really want in the collection, even though

1733
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:20,100
it kind of sucks ass to play, because it's a combination

1734
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,420
pinball video game.

1735
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:24,260
It actually, I think, was one of the inspirations, I want

1736
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,660
to say, eventually, for what gave us the

1737
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,900
Pinball 2000 franchise.

1738
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,740
Also for console, we had Pac-Attack, Pac-Man 2, Pac in

1739
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:35,820
Time, Pac-Man World, Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness.

1740
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,380
Dude, there's so many different ones.

1741
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:43,980
Pac-Man Carnival this year, multiple home versions, all

1742
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,220
kinds of stuff.

1743
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,100
So yeah, we have had.

1744
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:51,120
I would have to say that my favorite Pac-Man game in the

1745
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,580
series, overall, just as far as fun to play, is Super Pac-Man.

1746
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,180
That's what I was just loading up right now.

1747
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,260
I love Super Pac-Man.

1748
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,740
That game is so much fun.

1749
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:05,180
And of course, there were clones like Funny Man and

1750
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,420
blah, blah, blah.

1751
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,420
Now, this was kind of cool.

1752
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,100
And I remember reading up on this a while back that there

1753
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,880
were a bunch of students that went to Simon Fraser

1754
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,820
University, who did Lifesize Pac-Man, who used laptops and

1755
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:24,580
mobile phone GPS to track where the dots were and where

1756
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,100
Pac-Man was.

1757
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:30,900
And it is now played regularly in downtown Vancouver.

1758
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:35,100
There's also another one that's Pac-Manhatten, where

1759
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:39,140
Pac-Man is played around Washington Square Park.

1760
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,540
And I've actually seen video of that one.

1761
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:43,220
That one's pretty cool.

1762
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:47,620
Actually, they were going to do a Pac-Man movie in 2004.

1763
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,420
Crystal Sky Pictures said they were going to do it.

1764
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,940
And no.

1765
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:53,340
Thank god, because it would have been terrible.

1766
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,580
It was supposed to be $200 million.

1767
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,700
And as you heard in the background, there was Pac-Man

1768
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:04,860
Fever, which was just put out for fun.

1769
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,580
And it actually made it to number nine on

1770
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,020
Billboard Hot 100 charts.

1771
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:16,620
Guinness World Records gave Pac-Man eight records in 2008,

1772
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,500
including first perfect Pac-Man game for Billy

1773
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,840
Mitchell, asshole, most successful coin-operated game,

1774
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,660
largest Pac-Man game for Pac-Manhatten.

1775
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,180
Really, it's been sort of a generation-defining game.

1776
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,740
And also, Rob, now you have to find this, because we have to

1777
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,080
play this.

1778
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:42,500
There was the Pac-Man 7-Up commercial, set sort of to a

1779
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,420
modified tune like Betty Davis' eyes.

1780
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,500
I would be happy to, but act-deaf is going to have a

1781
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,980
coronary if you don't mention Pac-Man Championship Edition.

1782
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:50,700
I did.

1783
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,700
Oh, you must have missed it.

1784
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,660
Amongst the gazillion other Pac-Man games you mentioned.

1785
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,340
Of course, I'm sure you mentioned the Pac-Man animated

1786
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:58,980
series.

1787
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:00,220
Oh, yes.

1788
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:15,140
We'll look at each other.

1789
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,380
This is creepy.

1790
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,900
This is very creepy.

1791
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,140
Only in the Amex.

1792
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,020
This is actually on TV.

1793
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:38,700
Yes, it was.

1794
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,260
I don't remember ever seeing this.

1795
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:42,100
This is kind of scary.

1796
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,340
All right.

1797
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,420
Just look down in the chatroom for

1798
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,260
what you want us to watch.

1799
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:47,500
Sure, sure.

1800
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,540
You see what I mean by the sound of Betty Davis' eyes?

1801
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,540
Oh, yeah, I hear it.

1802
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,900
Hold on, I'm going to fire up my favorite Pac-Man parody

1803
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,460
while Jamie finishes up the game.

1804
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,100
Oh, I'm pretty much done.

1805
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,980
But yeah, Pac-Man.

1806
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:05,860
OK, this is my favorite frickin' Pac-Man

1807
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,660
parody they ever had, OK?

1808
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,260
This is like the best thing ever.

1809
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,500
Here we go.

1810
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,700
Math Man, your mission is?

1811
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,460
Math Man is not here.

1812
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,380
Oh, where is he?

1813
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,260
He's in the math room.

1814
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,340
OK.

1815
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:30,740
Mr. Glitch, your mission is to eat all the pentagons on the

1816
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,780
board and no other polygons.

1817
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:34,580
When you encounter a polygon, you'll have to be

1818
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,580
health-free to make her to see.

1819
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,940
Thank you very much.

1820
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:38,940
End of discussion.

1821
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:40,100
There is no further debate.

1822
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,540
Math Man was the greatest.

1823
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,740
Forget that 7UP commercial.

1824
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:44,980
Math Man was the bomb.

1825
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,260
All right.

1826
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:46,740
That's it.

1827
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,740
We're going to take a break now here on

1828
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,860
Orange Lawns Radio.

1829
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,500
And if you're listening on the podcast, the good news is you

1830
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:53,900
only have to wait like 10 seconds.

1831
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,660
For those of you listening live, we need a moment to

1832
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:59,180
stretch and refill our drinks and so forth and have a little

1833
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:00,100
break here in studio.

1834
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,340
But we'll be back in just a few more minutes here with

1835
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,060
more of Orange Lawns Radio and some stories coming up.

1836
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,700
Xbox 360, we've barely touched on what's going on in

1837
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,780
Microsoft's world.

1838
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,900
Their whole damn E3 lineup might have just

1839
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:12,820
leaked to the internet.

1840
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:15,800
We'll discuss what's been leaked and if it carries any

1841
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,500
weight or not.

1842
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,940
We'll be back in a little bit with more

1843
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,380
of Orange Lawns Radio.

1844
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:24,260
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lawns Radio on this

1845
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:28,420
lovely Sunday evening, May the 17th of 2009.

1846
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:32,660
We tape live every Sunday here at All Games Radio.

1847
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,660
That's www.allgames.com.

1848
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:39,860
We follow the Bobby Blackwolf Show at Roughly.

1849
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:40,820
See, we're amateur radio.

1850
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:41,740
We can't speak right.

1851
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:42,620
Bobby Blackwolf.

1852
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,740
The Bobbily Bobbily.

1853
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,660
Jeez, Louise.

1854
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,620
OK, the Bobby Blackwolf Show.

1855
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:51,020
Which is at Roughly 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9

1856
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:53,300
o'clock Eastern Time every Sunday night, right here on

1857
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,420
All Games Radio.

1858
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,540
It's a fun time, so you should definitely tune in.

1859
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,220
Anyhow, we've got more gaming news to get back into.

1860
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,980
It's myself and Loki and Dark Soccer all joining you on this

1861
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:03,860
lovely evening.

1862
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:05,820
And I was just thinking, how funny would it be if somebody

1863
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,620
didn't get the memo that we moved studios tonight and was

1864
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:10,420
showing up at the old studio unannounced?

1865
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,820
Funny for us, not for them.

1866
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,260
Yeah, I know exactly.

1867
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,940
Funny, not funny.

1868
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,780
All right, we have some Xbox 360 news to get

1869
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:18,860
into right now.

1870
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:20,380
Loki.

1871
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:26,740
Apparently, there's a new Xbox exclusive coming.

1872
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:30,300
And this is coming from a new company that Microsoft has

1873
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,660
purchased, Big Park.

1874
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:37,540
And apparently, they're responsible for such

1875
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,180
franchises, or at least they had a hand in it, for Need

1876
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:42,540
for Speed, SSX, and NBA Street.

1877
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:46,300
And this new game, though, is supposed to be something that

1878
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:51,020
will broaden audiences and will be playable at E3.

1879
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:51,820
Huh.

1880
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:52,980
Let me guess.

1881
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,660
Could it be something that ties in with that motion

1882
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:58,140
camera that doesn't exist?

1883
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:02,060
That could be like a Wii Sports type of game.

1884
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,260
I'm going to guess yes.

1885
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,460
That's probably what it's going to be.

1886
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:08,380
Well, that is a completely baseless guess right there.

1887
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,260
How dare you, sir?

1888
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:09,820
What do I know?

1889
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:13,740
I'm not an industry analyst.

1890
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,500
So I apparently know nothing about this.

1891
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,140
What exactly does it take to have the title industry

1892
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:18,780
analyst?

1893
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:21,340
Because maybe I would like to just have that after my name.

1894
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,580
Kiss enough ass to get promoted.

1895
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:24,980
Well, I promote myself.

1896
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:25,940
How's that?

1897
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:28,500
At Orange Lawns Radio, I am the industry analyst.

1898
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,500
I just promoted myself.

1899
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,060
Well, you have to be, I guess, on call with big companies

1900
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:39,420
and have to make a, or have to be on call with big companies.

1901
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,780
Or help them make decisions.

1902
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,260
I don't know.

1903
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,860
I can do that.

1904
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:45,260
I'd be good at that.

1905
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,540
Whatever.

1906
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:46,860
All right.

1907
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:50,060
Well, anyhow, moving on with some other gaming news.

1908
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:53,580
By the way, I forgot to mention it at the top of the hour.

1909
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:56,860
But we are going to still be giving away that Smile DK

1910
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:00,620
signed copy of PlayStation 2 DDR Supernova 2.

1911
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:02,460
We're going to give that away in a little while.

1912
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:03,500
We'll probably do it around, yeah, we'll

1913
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:06,620
do it around the mailbag segment a little later this hour.

1914
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,900
Anyhow, we got some news from Q Entertainment

1915
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,420
has filed a trademark.

1916
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,900
Now, of course, you know I love me some Q Entertainment.

1917
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:15,820
They're the folks that put out Luminous.

1918
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:19,740
And let's see, they put out, well, they put out Luminous.

1919
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:20,220
Res.

1920
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:20,700
No, I'm just kidding.

1921
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,380
Yeah, they res every extend extra.

1922
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,420
If you want to trace back Mizuguchi,

1923
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,180
who's behind Q Games, he did such great things

1924
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:28,300
to Space Channel 5.

1925
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,180
99 Nights?

1926
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,340
Yeah, well, we just overlooked 99 Nights.

1927
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:33,340
Hopefully, this game is going to be amazing.

1928
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:36,700
It's called Guardian Hearts, is the name of the trademark.

1929
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,660
Now, you want to keep in mind, this is just

1930
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,100
a trademark that's been filed.

1931
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,820
Nothing is definitely concrete about this yet.

1932
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:44,300
We don't know.

1933
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,380
It could, you know, games sometimes change names

1934
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:47,660
and so on and so forth.

1935
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,420
However, I hold out hope that somehow Mizuguchi

1936
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,740
got the rights to make the sequel to Guardian Legend,

1937
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,340
and it's called Guardian Hearts.

1938
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,780
That's what I'm holding out for.

1939
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:57,740
Not bloody likely.

1940
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,780
Yeah, not bloody likely.

1941
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:01,260
But it does sound, it doesn't sound a little role playing-ish

1942
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:01,580
to you.

1943
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,020
Doesn't it?

1944
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:03,580
Like a little bit?

1945
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:05,820
Like, Guardian Hearts kind of sounds role playing-ish.

1946
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,180
Or magical girl game.

1947
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,700
So, well, that could be fun too.

1948
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,020
But either way, you know, I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi,

1949
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,220
so I would be very happy if he's doing a role playing game,

1950
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:16,140
as long as it's not like 99 Nights.

1951
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,740
But there you have it.

1952
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,900
Guardian Hearts possibly coming soon.

1953
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:20,380
Who knows?

1954
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,700
Maybe as soon as E3, but don't hold your breath.

1955
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:27,820
Well, Telltale has some new episodic series for E3.

1956
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:33,020
They are, um, well, they're not saying what it is,

1957
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:35,820
but then again, these are the people that gave us Sam & Max

1958
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:37,820
and Showing Bads Cool Game for Attractive People

1959
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:38,780
and Wallace & Gromit.

1960
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:45,420
But it's also going to commemorate, as far as I'm aware,

1961
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,420
the fifth year anniversary for the company,

1962
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:48,300
which is pretty cool.

1963
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,780
Especially making it while the market's gone to shit.

1964
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:55,180
So, um, hopefully it'll be something really cool.

1965
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:55,820
I'm sure it will.

1966
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:59,180
Everything they've put out so far, you know, recently has been pretty cool.

1967
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:05,900
And also, um, for, uh, uh, people who like a good deal,

1968
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,660
the entire season of Strong Bads Cool Game for Attractive People

1969
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:12,220
is half price on Steam until Monday.

1970
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:14,460
Yikes. Better hurry.

1971
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:15,020
Yep.

1972
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:15,740
That's pretty cool.

1973
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:17,180
All right.

1974
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:20,380
Well, uh, I know I'm, uh, I'm curious to see what they cook up next.

1975
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,660
That company's been doing very well.

1976
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,060
You're right.

1977
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,900
I think one point you made there is they've been doing pretty well

1978
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,220
in the face of a company's closing and so forth.

1979
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,980
Day of the Tentacle! Day of the Tentacle! Day of the Tentacle!

1980
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:29,820
Uh, don't hold your breath, but you never know.

1981
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,700
You never know.

1982
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:32,300
It's the only Luke Starts franchise-

1983
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,180
Well, one of them that they haven't touched yet.

1984
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:36,860
Day of the Tentacle! Come on!

1985
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:39,580
That's what we need.

1986
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,700
More Maniac Mansion.

1987
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,340
Um, anyways.

1988
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:46,140
So, I don't know.

1989
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:50,540
Other than, uh, Day of the Tentacle, what more can we talk about?

1990
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:51,260
I know!

1991
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:59,900
How about the supposed, and this is all rumor, lineup for a Microsoft press conference?

1992
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:07,980
Apparently, there is a new industry source, or somebody that's claiming to be an industry source,

1993
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:16,220
in tradition of Surfer Girl, who apparently has gone into retirement from leaking information.

1994
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:20,380
Um, Game Fork. This is coming from Twitter.

1995
01:27:20,380 --> 01:27:25,740
And they have been tweeting about different things coming from the Microsoft press conference.

1996
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,500
Um, including-

1997
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,500
So it's not like your normal Twitter where it's like,

1998
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,220
I just ate a ham sandwich and it was delicious.

1999
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,340
No, it's not.

2000
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:34,460
BRB pooping.

2001
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:36,620
Not quite.

2002
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:40,540
By the way, if you want to join the OLR Twitter, we don't put Twits like that.

2003
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:44,380
We just like to remind you when the show is live and post other little tidbits about the show,

2004
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,980
but we will not share when we are pooping like other people do on Twitter.

2005
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:50,780
Like you have time to type that, if you gotta go, you gotta go.

2006
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:52,460
Unless you lie about it.

2007
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:55,180
But you can, you know, instead of reading a magazine, you could Twitter from the potty,

2008
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:00,060
and I've seen, I've actually, I have a friend that has updated her Facebook status

2009
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,140
to say, hi, I'm on the toilet.

2010
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:04,800
Nice.

2011
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:08,460
That's the day and age we live in.

2012
01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:13,980
Well, um, apparently, uh, here are some of the things that were on that list.

2013
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:18,700
Starting off with, of course, they're going to reveal a new motion sensing camera controller.

2014
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:21,020
It's going to be called the Xbox Fluid.

2015
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:25,980
Um, apparently they're going to end the whole thing with a finale.

2016
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:32,140
And I don't know if I can believe this, but Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus Oxide.

2017
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:37,740
It's apparently a rumor of the X, or a Xbox 360 port with, you know, kind of that

2018
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,780
extra added content on there.

2019
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:43,500
You were right.

2020
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,100
That's apparently going to be their finale.

2021
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:53,020
And then, there's supposed to be a top secret exclusive Xbox 360 tile that nobody outside

2022
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:55,900
of Konami has been told what this is.

2023
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,500
Yet, this guy knows what it is.

2024
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:06,140
But, I have a feeling that that might be the new Castlevania game, since they haven't

2025
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:08,220
really shown much of that.

2026
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:08,720
Ooh!

2027
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:10,380
That's right!

2028
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,340
We haven't had one on the new Next Gen series, have we?

2029
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:14,620
They had a little preview video.

2030
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:15,980
That's right!

2031
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,620
It was like two seconds of nothing.

2032
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:19,100
Yeah.

2033
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:19,740
Interesting.

2034
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:20,060
Okay.

2035
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:20,860
So there might be that.

2036
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:27,900
The second Grand Theft Auto 4 download content was supposed to be announced and being subtitled

2037
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:36,540
Blood and a Four Leaf Clover, which may follow the other character that was in the game,

2038
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:42,700
Packey, and his brothers as they try to pull off a bank heist or something like that, because

2039
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,500
that was in the game.

2040
01:29:44,620 --> 01:29:45,180
Interesting.

2041
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:53,820
The new Peter Milano project, codenamed Richter, is supposed to be shown.

2042
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:59,260
They're going to show some stuff about Forza 3, that's going to be playable.

2043
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:06,700
Alan Wake is going to be there, as well as APB, which is going to be announced, available

2044
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:11,580
for the Xbox 360, I'm assuming, unless they're going to be covering games for Windows there.

2045
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:17,340
Splinter Cell Conviction will be on hand, Lost Planet 2, Assassin's Creed 2, Bioshock

2046
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:22,140
2, Halo 3 ODST, which is not surprising.

2047
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:31,100
And then, I think that was it, but it's interesting because of course Microsoft responded back

2048
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:36,700
with, no that's not even close to what we have, but I guess we'll have to see if that's

2049
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:41,180
actually, I mean some of this stuff could be educated guesses, I mean everyone's assuming

2050
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:44,380
that Alan Wake will be there, obviously they're going to have the new Grand Theft Auto download

2051
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:46,860
content since it's due out in the fall.

2052
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:49,340
But seriously, Blood and a Four Leaf Clover?

2053
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:53,260
Like, that's a very interesting title for a game.

2054
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:59,340
Yeah, it is interesting, although it doesn't really fit with what everyone was thinking

2055
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:04,140
the next game's going to be, because basically there's a mission where you have this drug

2056
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:06,140
deal and there's three people involved.

2057
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:11,900
The first one being Nico from the first game, the second one being Johnny from the second

2058
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:16,860
download content, and then the third one is some other guy who they're thinking is going

2059
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:21,740
to be the third download content, and it's all supposed to merge on that one mission.

2060
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:25,740
But, I don't know, we'll see I guess what happens there.

2061
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:33,820
Interesting nonetheless though, and Rockstar did say that they are going to announce the

2062
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:37,420
next download content, so I mean we kind of figured that was going to happen anyways,

2063
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:40,700
but they didn't confirm that that's the subtitle that they had.

2064
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:48,700
So, and then the guys behind APB said yes, they will be at E3 with a big announcement.

2065
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,540
So, a lot of stuff just hints at that, but see then again you can take all those hints

2066
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,980
and kind of come up with educated guess.

2067
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:58,460
I don't know, but the point is, you know, why fake, you know, these announcements or

2068
01:31:58,460 --> 01:31:59,660
something other, I don't know.

2069
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,900
Well, I think some of it holds weight.

2070
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,420
I think the fluid thing is going to happen.

2071
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:04,940
I think we all know that...

2072
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:07,420
It may not be called the fluid, but you know, it might be something.

2073
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:11,820
Yeah, I think that's a pretty likely name actually, all things considered.

2074
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,580
That's, you know, it makes sense, especially if the whole thing is about motion and it

2075
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:18,860
sees everything in little subtle movements and all that.

2076
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:22,300
I bet anything that fluid is a very possible name for this.

2077
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,060
Yeah, but we'll see.

2078
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:28,780
actdeft in chat very plainly says MGS4 on 360 ain't happening.

2079
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:32,860
And lazy days follows that up with because Kojima's done.

2080
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:36,300
That is a hard one to believe, but what about now Metal Gear Solid 5?

2081
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,580
I don't think they would necessarily have a trailer or anything, but what about an announcement?

2082
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,060
I don't think it's going to be Metal Gear Solid 4.

2083
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,220
I don't think that's going to come to the 360 because, you know, the amount of data

2084
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:50,220
that's on there, unless they went back and found a way to compress all that down and

2085
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:51,260
stuff like that.

2086
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:55,180
Or if they have a way that you can now with installations and stuff like that, you can

2087
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:57,340
just install all the disks to your hard drive.

2088
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:01,900
And really, I mean, when you think about it, you know, either waiting, you know, five minutes

2089
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:06,940
to install a game or I don't know, making this swap that one time.

2090
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:07,500
Oh my God.

2091
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,100
It takes like two seconds.

2092
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:10,300
Is it such a big deal?

2093
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,620
I don't think so, but who knows?

2094
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:14,380
All right.

2095
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:18,780
Well, it'll be interesting to see if this actually holds weight at E3 because if it

2096
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:23,580
does, then this whole little Twitter source is going to be huge in the future.

2097
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:23,900
Watch.

2098
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:27,260
They'll blow up to 60,000 followers if it's the case.

2099
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:30,300
Press conference is supposed to be June 1st, 9 a.m.

2100
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:35,420
Tora in chat says, I would gladly disk swap to play Metal Gear Solid 4.

2101
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,900
I wish I could be there for the Microsoft conference, but I'm going to be getting into

2102
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,180
town on June 1st.

2103
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:41,580
I might get to go to Sony's.

2104
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:42,380
Might.

2105
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:44,060
I'm watching both.

2106
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:47,340
I'm not going to go because I'm not going to even be there.

2107
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:48,300
It's going to be tough.

2108
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,060
Anyhow, let's move on and go into Rock Band Unplugged.

2109
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:55,820
Of course, as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, he's got to take a sneak peek at it.

2110
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,860
And a lot of people have been taking a sneak peek at the game because the track list is

2111
01:33:58,860 --> 01:33:59,500
at the internet.

2112
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,500
This game, by the way, is coming out June 9th, 2009, which is right around the corner

2113
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,380
from E3 week.

2114
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,940
That's all that's hit the internet.

2115
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:09,260
Yeah, well, I bet a lot of folks have already been getting it.

2116
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:13,660
But if you are being a good boy or a good girl and waiting until its actual release

2117
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:15,820
day, some of the things you have to look forward to.

2118
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:19,180
I'm just going to read you some of the songs that are exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged,

2119
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,460
at least for a little while.

2120
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,220
They do emphasize for a limited time.

2121
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:27,980
AFI, Miss Murder, Audioslave, Gasoline, Black Tide, Show Me The Way, Freeze Pop, Let's

2122
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:28,700
Talk More Rock.

2123
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:31,740
Now, see, I thought that song was in Rock Band.

2124
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:32,700
I thought it was in Rock Band.

2125
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:36,140
I thought it was too, but they're not only an exclusive game, maybe because it was download

2126
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:36,540
content.

2127
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:36,860
I don't know.

2128
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:42,380
Three Doors Down, Kryptonite, Alice in Chains, Wood, Blink-182, What's My Age Again.

2129
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,100
Again, wasn't that download content or am I mixing it up with Dammit?

2130
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:45,580
I don't know.

2131
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:51,660
Tora in chat says it's Guitar Hero.

2132
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,620
It's a Guitar Hero song.

2133
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:56,060
That's why they're marking it as an exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged.

2134
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:01,180
1970s brings us ABC by The Jackson 5.

2135
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:03,180
That's the other big exclusive song.

2136
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:07,100
The rest of them are all songs you might recognize from the game already, like some of the ones

2137
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,300
I personally like.

2138
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:10,140
Float On by Modest Mouse.

2139
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:10,940
That's pretty cool.

2140
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:17,820
Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Today, Smashing Pumpkins, I Was Wrong, Social Distortion,

2141
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:19,180
Weezer, Buddy Holly.

2142
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:20,300
It'll be fun.

2143
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,420
White Wedding, Billy Idol.

2144
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,620
You gotta have some Billy Idol.

2145
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:26,700
Susie and the Banshees, yes, Killing Jar, pretty decent song list.

2146
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:29,180
I don't know, but Loki seems to maybe disagree.

2147
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:29,980
It's okay.

2148
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:35,260
It's something I'd play off and on, but you know, it's not a game I could really get into

2149
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:41,580
like the normal rock band, unless they have, you know, a more variety of download content,

2150
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:44,700
like, you know, some pop songs and that kind of stuff.

2151
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:49,260
Because this, they could do that, but are they?

2152
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:53,500
I mean, ABC, that's definitely Poppy, so we'll see.

2153
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:57,580
Well, don't we have Lego Rock Band to come fill in the pop void?

2154
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,260
That's true, but that's another game.

2155
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,380
That's not this game.

2156
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:06,220
Lego Rock Band, I am very interested in picking up just, well, after I see the soundtrack,

2157
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:08,060
but I don't know.

2158
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:12,220
Well, speaking of download content, there's going to be download stuff available right

2159
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:16,060
off the bat for this game, and some of the songs have already been announced there.

2160
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:19,260
Now, some of it overlaps with what you can already download.

2161
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:21,900
Actually, I think all of it does.

2162
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:26,780
Muse with Hysteria, No Doubt, Just a Girl, Paramore, Crush Crush Crush, Red Hot Chili

2163
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,820
Peppers Under the Bridge.

2164
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:31,180
Some of the, I think all of these songs are already available on regular rock band, but

2165
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:32,540
if you want to pay for it again, you can.

2166
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:39,100
I wish I could get the songs that I have on my rock band over, but I know that's not going

2167
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:39,500
to happen.

2168
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:40,620
Why not?

2169
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:41,580
They'll charge me twice.

2170
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:45,900
By the way, the chat room always filling in the void when we don't know things right off

2171
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:50,540
the bat, off the top of our head, which, you know, hey, look, we know a lot about video

2172
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:53,260
games, but we don't have the brain capacity to know everything about video games.

2173
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:56,380
That's why the chat room really helps us out every week.

2174
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:59,900
Act Def says the only Blink 182 songs are Dammit and All the Small Things.

2175
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,140
So I guess What's My Age Again actually isn't in there.

2176
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:05,180
Maybe I'm getting it mixed up with Sing Star, because I have too many music games at home.

2177
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:05,680
I don't know.

2178
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:07,180
So there you go.

2179
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,860
Death Wishing calls Lego rock band Lego Fail Band.

2180
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:13,340
We'll see.

2181
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,260
Game's got a little while before it comes out.

2182
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:16,620
Does it get hit with the fail pail?

2183
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:17,900
Hopefully not.

2184
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:19,820
That's my hope.

2185
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:23,340
Well, here's something that may or may not be fail.

2186
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:24,140
It just depends.

2187
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:29,500
There's a splash page for a particular game showing up on Xbox.com.

2188
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:35,260
But I'm pretty sure that splash page means actual release.

2189
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:39,740
So that'd be Wolfenstein 3D on Xbox Live.

2190
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:43,660
And I kind of hope that it's given the HD treatment.

2191
01:37:43,660 --> 01:37:47,020
But do you really want to shoot HD red-eyed Hitler in the face?

2192
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:48,940
I don't think it's going to be having the HD treatment.

2193
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:52,620
And it makes sense with a new Wolfenstein game coming out in a few months.

2194
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:53,020
That's true.

2195
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:56,700
But I think it'd be nice to give it the HD treatment.

2196
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,100
It'd be cool.

2197
01:37:59,100 --> 01:37:59,980
I don't think it's going to be cool.

2198
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,100
Cool, but not bloody likely.

2199
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,700
Yeah, not likely.

2200
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,500
I mean, they didn't really do that with Doom or Duke Nukem.

2201
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,260
So I don't think they're going to start now.

2202
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:08,460
It'd be kind of...

2203
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,060
It'd look weird anyways if he did that.

2204
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:12,220
It'd kind of take away from the cheapness.

2205
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:14,940
Now what they needed to have is Rise of the Triad on there.

2206
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:15,820
Because that'd be sweet.

2207
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,540
Yes, a lot better than...

2208
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,900
Actually, it would be kind of cool with Wolfenstein if they did it.

2209
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,340
It was like co-op or something like that.

2210
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,380
That'd be kind of cool too.

2211
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:26,300
But they're definitely not going to do that either.

2212
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:31,500
Well, there's a couple stories I have here about GameTap.

2213
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:37,180
Including, they're going to start featuring some of the Microsoft Game Studios stuff.

2214
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:43,660
Including Age of Mythology, Age of Empires II, Fable, The Lost Chapter, Freelancer,

2215
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:48,700
MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, Rise of the Nation, and Zoo Tycoon.

2216
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:58,860
And apparently right now, the US and Europe have...

2217
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:05,580
Europe is getting Fable, The Lost Chapter, and MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, and Zoo Tycoon.

2218
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:12,220
And then also, I guess, US is getting Age of Empires II and Fable right now.

2219
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:14,460
And the rest are going to roll out slowly later.

2220
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:15,820
Which is kind of neat.

2221
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:22,860
And then also, GameTap has apparently the rights right now for Panzer Dragoon Saga.

2222
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:24,380
Sweet!

2223
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:27,980
However, they're running into some emulation complexities.

2224
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:31,740
And haven't been able to release it yet.

2225
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:36,220
But can I say one other thing about my gaming week, since you brought it up?

2226
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,740
I tried to get back into GameTap.

2227
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:43,100
I haven't played GameTap since they switched from their little front-end program they used

2228
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,780
to browser integrated.

2229
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:47,020
And might I say, I hate it.

2230
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,780
I hate the new GameTap.

2231
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:52,140
Like, it took me forever to get it to figure out how to work.

2232
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,140
Like, the old one was so much better.

2233
01:39:54,140 --> 01:39:55,820
Why did they make it worse?

2234
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:59,340
I guess they were acquired by this new company or whatever, but I don't like it.

2235
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:03,260
Now it feels like I'm going on to, like, a cheap Games.Yahoo site or playing things.

2236
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:05,660
Like, you know, right there in the browser window and all that stuff.

2237
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:06,860
I don't like it at all.

2238
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:08,700
Like, it seems like what they had before was just fine.

2239
01:40:09,340 --> 01:40:09,980
I don't know.

2240
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,740
You know I used to be a huge GameTap fan.

2241
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:13,660
In fact, people thought I was on their payroll and stuff.

2242
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:16,220
I do not like these changes they've been making lately.

2243
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:20,380
And it kind of, I'm still irritated at the fact that nothing runs in Windows Vista.

2244
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:23,500
This didn't used to bug me because I didn't always use Windows Vista.

2245
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,820
But, you know, I understand emulation, blah, blah, blah.

2246
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:26,700
Not everything's possible.

2247
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:28,460
But it's just, ugh, it's annoying.

2248
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:30,700
Well, also, the whole Panzer Dragon thing.

2249
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:34,380
They're all, the complexity of the Saturn emulation is what's holding it back.

2250
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:38,860
I have a perfectly functioning Saturn emulator already, you know.

2251
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:40,860
So it can be done.

2252
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,820
And they're all, well, we're not sure if enough people want this game.

2253
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:48,460
So, you know, if we get enough people wanting it, then we'll spend the large

2254
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,780
development time that's going to take to do this.

2255
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:55,180
Rama in chat says, run it under XP compatibility.

2256
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:56,060
Does it work?

2257
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:57,660
Look at GameTap's own FAQs.

2258
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,220
It'll tell you.

2259
01:40:58,220 --> 01:40:58,700
It doesn't work.

2260
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:02,860
I tried that when it was still on the front end system because I can't play Civ 4,

2261
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,300
which kind of makes me mad.

2262
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:04,780
I don't know.

2263
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:09,820
I just, I see the value of GameTap kind of going down, not up.

2264
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:12,780
And that's what kind of, you know, I still think it's an all right value.

2265
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:14,780
You know, you do get a lot of freaking games.

2266
01:41:14,780 --> 01:41:15,900
And at least you're paying for it.

2267
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:19,340
So you have that whole good karma thing going on instead of just being a maim

2268
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:20,700
whore with all the ROMs.

2269
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,060
And there's some decent stuff on there.

2270
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:23,740
But damn, they've got some work to do.

2271
01:41:23,740 --> 01:41:25,900
And I hate the new front end compared to the old one.

2272
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:27,500
I don't know.

2273
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:30,540
It's, I was kind of dumb and bought a whole year in advance, but whatever.

2274
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:33,980
They got you hooked and then changed it.

2275
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,420
I get, yeah, exactly.

2276
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:38,620
That's what I feel like exactly is what it is, is that they got me hooked on

2277
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:39,660
something that was pretty awesome.

2278
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:41,180
And then the rug got pulled out from under me.

2279
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,620
I do not like the browser setup.

2280
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:43,740
Blah.

2281
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:49,900
Anyhow, one thing I might like a little more than the new GameTap is the slim

2282
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:51,260
PlayStation 3.

2283
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:53,580
That is if rumors are to be believed.

2284
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:57,020
Uh, apparently there are pictures floating around on the blogs this week

2285
01:41:57,020 --> 01:41:59,260
of a PlayStation 3 slim.

2286
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,340
Apparently what will happen on this PlayStation 3 slim is that instead of

2287
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:06,380
that whole, like, uh, kind of shiny black look, it'll look a little more

2288
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:08,060
like a PlayStation 2.

2289
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:12,860
And, uh, apparently now, instead of having a Spider-Man looking logo, it'll

2290
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,020
kind of look just like a PlayStation 2.

2291
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:15,900
Uh, who knows?

2292
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:18,620
Maybe this is just a Photoshop PlayStation 2 box.

2293
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,420
But, uh, who knows?

2294
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:20,300
It is rumors.

2295
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:23,100
They actually have pictures of the actual diecast step too.

2296
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:23,740
Do they really?

2297
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:25,580
I mean, I don't know.

2298
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:27,980
It might be a prototype, but then again, they have a box.

2299
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:28,540
So I don't know.

2300
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,940
I, I'm a little iffy on this.

2301
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:33,580
It's still, doesn't it still seem a little soon?

2302
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:36,620
Well, not necessarily because if you think about it, remember when we had a

2303
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:40,940
rumor like this for the Xbox 360, that it was getting a built-in HDMI port.

2304
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:44,540
And sure enough, those pictures leaked out of like the motherboard and

2305
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:46,540
everything with the HDMI port in it.

2306
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,660
And then we got the systems with the HDMI ports now.

2307
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:52,540
So I'm not surprised this is going to eventually happen.

2308
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,460
And maybe it's happening right now.

2309
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,420
Maybe they think this redesigns what's going to get people to buy it.

2310
01:42:57,420 --> 01:43:00,140
I think they're stupid because it's just like the same, you know, Oh,

2311
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:01,900
let's take out the backwards compatibility.

2312
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,700
Oh, let's.

2313
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:04,780
Now take out some of those USB ports.

2314
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,380
Oh, let's do this.

2315
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,300
Put the backwards compatibility back in.

2316
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:09,980
Maybe you'll now you'll be talking.

2317
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:10,860
But who knows?

2318
01:43:10,860 --> 01:43:13,260
I mean, if they're going to, I don't know, but maybe this is why they keep

2319
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:13,980
swearing up and down.

2320
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:16,300
There's not going to be a price drop because there's just going to be

2321
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:17,740
a new system instead.

2322
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:18,300
Who knows?

2323
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:20,700
I don't know if they had the backwards compatibility backyard and

2324
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:24,060
people are going to get pissed, but then again there are some stupid people out there that will buy

2325
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:29,180
another system for this, but I don't understand why you can just buy a Playstation 2.

2326
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:32,420
Maybe that's what they're hoping. People are just going to get fed up and buy another

2327
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:35,700
Playstation 2 or something. I don't know.

2328
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:42,420
Well, there you go. That's it. Sony is supposedly releasing a slim Playstation 3.

2329
01:43:42,420 --> 01:43:47,460
We will see more at possibly E3 this week. But you know what? I don't know about you guys,

2330
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:51,580
but all these rumors running around left and right, it seems like anybody can come up with

2331
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:55,180
a rumor in this day and age. And not being able to sort all this shit out makes me a

2332
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:58,940
little angsty. Do you know what happens when we get angsty?

2333
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,940
People die. That, and there's a nephews of the week segment.

2334
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:30,700
My nephew is going to go to finals sapping my brain, my strength, my willpower, and any

2335
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:39,460
ounce of energy I could possibly have. I just want to pass, and I want to take a break.

2336
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:46,340
My nephew uses a stool, it's hurting my butt. At least it's not the other kind of stool.

2337
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:50,180
Yes, that is true. Do you have a hard stool?

2338
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:58,140
I do have a hard stool right now. Ew, you should put that on Twitter.

2339
01:44:58,140 --> 01:45:02,700
Let's see, my nephew of the week goes to, I don't really have a lot. You know what?

2340
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:06,620
Things are actually going pretty good in my life right now. I can't complain. Chicago

2341
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,220
was fun. Make up something.

2342
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:11,860
No, I do have one. But I just want to say, you know what? All things are actually pretty

2343
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:17,000
good except, a few to my broken air conditioner. Because living in a house with no air conditioner

2344
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:23,460
in 100 degree weather sucks. So a few to that. But thank you to people like Jamie who let

2345
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:27,740
me come over and sit in their air conditioned house all night.

2346
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:30,780
Actually, now that it's gotten cooler outside, this room is a lot more comfortable.

2347
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:36,460
Yeah, it's nice now. So there you go. But yeah, not having an air conditioning really

2348
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:43,360
sucks. Anyway, what sucks a little less is your emails. You email us every week at mailbag

2349
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:47,820
at orangelaundry.com and DarkSakura dives head first in the email bag and read some

2350
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:52,480
of your emails. And yes, we're also going to be giving away a signed autographed copy

2351
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:59,140
of Smile DK signing Supernova. We did have people get all five right. I'll tell you right

2352
01:45:59,140 --> 01:46:04,100
off the bat, if you didn't get all five right, sorry, you didn't win. Play again next time.

2353
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:07,100
But we did have several people that got all five and we're going to be telling you who

2354
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:11,700
won right after the email bag segment.

2355
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:18,740
DarkSakura, who's sending some email to mailbag this week?

2356
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:27,700
The first one is from, let's see, Taz. Hey there, this is my first email to the OLR mailbag

2357
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:33,180
and I want to suggest a retro game if it hasn't already been on the show already. Redundant.

2358
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:39,780
The game is Live Alive, an RPG from Squaresoft for the Super Famicom. I know about this game.

2359
01:46:39,780 --> 01:46:43,420
It was not released outside of Japan, but some unofficial translations are out there

2360
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:50,740
in the net. The real title is sort of a mirror image of Live Alive as with the other lives

2361
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:56,260
spelled backwards where you see evil in the second half rather than live. I thought this

2362
01:46:56,260 --> 01:47:00,100
game had one of the most original ideas for a game to date. You select one of seven playable

2363
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:04,060
characters and each character belongs to a different time period and has his or her own

2364
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:10,140
story for the story play like a complete, all stories play like a complete, a completely

2365
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:13,700
different RPG and they're short and easy to learn. For example, the caveman stories about

2366
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:18,340
a caveman saving his love because they haven't invented the language. There are no text box

2367
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:24,180
speeches in the story, but they communicate with figures in dialogue bubbles. Hilarity

2368
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:29,660
ensues. Some of the stories have a much darker tone as others may make you cry. I'm sorry,

2369
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:32,940
and others may make you cry. I really enjoyed the story for the robot in the future, which

2370
01:47:32,940 --> 01:47:37,980
plays like a survival horror. I suggest anyone who likes retro RPGs pick up this title. I'm

2371
01:47:37,980 --> 01:47:43,140
sure Square won't mind any more about the translated ROM. It'd be awesome if they add

2372
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:48,100
this game to a virtual console. I'd buy it. P.S. My also favorite RPG is Secret of Mana

2373
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:53,500
followed by Xenogears and Chrono Trigger. All are must plays. I'll give it a download.

2374
01:47:53,500 --> 01:48:00,480
If I have time, I'll give it a download. So sure. Yeah, I've not heard of this game ever,

2375
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:05,460
but it sounds very interesting. So that's all I got. I like listener submitted classic

2376
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:08,780
games of the week. They know more obscure shit than we do sometimes. I know of this

2377
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:12,980
game. Do you really? Yes. I've never heard of it. In fact, I think I know someone who

2378
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:26,340
owns it. Wow. Um, oh, yeah, this is, never mind. Um, this is from, uh, FrozenRay? I really

2379
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:32,760
don't like it. Oh, GS68, sorry. Um, hey Jamie, hey Loki, hey Robrobrob. So by the time you're

2380
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:37,220
reading this, your business at ASIN is done. I hope that went well. You've been hyping

2381
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:40,780
that up, but no mention of Faname, which has led me to believe you're not going this year,

2382
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:45,160
most likely subsequent years, which means, once again, I'll be the only active OLR listener

2383
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:50,100
at Faname. Since I'm rather sure OLR at Faname is not going to happen, I'm going to make

2384
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:54,780
a bet, if you do go to Faname after all, I will make myself cosplay as Rei Ayanami, oh

2385
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:59,860
my god, don't, at Faname 2010, and that means the whole universe is going to die. Yes, they

2386
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:04,580
will. I'll also consider a scheme to get Eye of Judgment to sell a million copies by May

2387
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:10,260
2010, so Loki also has to cosplay a tingle at the con. It's never going to happen because

2388
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:17,540
I think they've stopped making it, so, it's done. It's done. If you don't go to Faname,

2389
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:23,260
then I hope to see Dark Sakura, um, and maybe, maybe Rob at California Extreme this July

2390
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:29,340
is possible. That is more likely than Faname. I do want to confirm, just, uh, we did not

2391
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:34,380
make plans to attend Faname this year, nothing against Faname, it's a lovely con, but just

2392
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:39,260
so much other stuff going on. I'm actually trying to save up money to go to Las Vegas

2393
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:43,820
in July. For me, I had stuff going on with, um, you guys know I do some theater stuff

2394
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:47,820
on the weekends, and I just had a conflict, so, um, I couldn't do it. But I hope those

2395
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:53,460
of you guys that are going have a lot of fun. Less than 3 GS68 PS, this email is brought

2396
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:58,260
to you by the South Bay Home of the Never Ending Overcast Weather. However, California

2397
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:02,060
Extreme I have never been and I really want to go, and this is my year of going to things

2398
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:06,980
I haven't done before. It's fun. I know, so, I went to ASEN, I've, how many years did it

2399
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:12,060
take for me to finally get there, like 4 years? So, uh, maybe I'll do California Extreme finally.

2400
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:15,660
Well, I hope you don't have, you know, my experience of, you know, waiting 3 years to

2401
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:20,060
do something and then it finally sucking when you do it. What was that? Tower of Terror.

2402
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:26,500
Oh, hey, I love Tower of Terror. It, it freaked me the hell out. I can't do it ever again.

2403
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:31,500
Aww, it's fun. I heart it. I'm actually trying to go to Disneyland 1-3. I've been in an elevator

2404
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:37,660
when it fell 2 stories. I know, that can't be fun. And you know what? Mmm. Marissa was

2405
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:42,100
saying that it's the first part that scares you, that the whole story part was the scary

2406
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:46,180
part and the psyching you up. Oh no, the drop is the scariest part. Oh no. The lead up was

2407
01:50:46,180 --> 01:50:51,360
fun. I loved all that. But the dropping, I was like, yeah, I remember this feeling, only

2408
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:57,740
this is worse because it's pushing you. So yeah. I want to say, chat real quick, chat.orensonshortory.com.

2409
01:50:57,740 --> 01:51:01,220
Tora says, it was fun meeting Rob at ASEN. Thank you, it was fun meeting you too. Though

2410
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:04,900
he looked kind of out of it on Saturday. Yeah, again, did you hear the part about 9 people

2411
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:09,920
in the hotel room? That was the cocaine. Shut up. Cocaine's a hell of a drug. And then somebody

2412
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:15,100
who didn't change their name, their recruit number 3972 says, what about Comic Con? I

2413
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:19,820
would love to go to Comic Con and Miss Victoria has been begging me. I don't know if you remember

2414
01:51:19,820 --> 01:51:23,220
her. She was on the show a while ago when Jamie was out one week. She'd been begging

2415
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:26,860
me to go to Comic Con, but this year it's not going to happen because we're going to

2416
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:31,220
see no doubt the same weekend. I want to go to Comic Con just to, you know, harass my

2417
01:51:31,220 --> 01:51:35,100
favorite Marvel people if they're there. I want to go one year because you run into celebrities

2418
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:39,780
all the time there and I'm dying to meet Zachary Quinto because he's dreamy. But anyway, maybe

2419
01:51:39,780 --> 01:51:45,460
next year. This email, dun dun dun. Hi, OLR crew. I just wanted to say after your last

2420
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:48,100
show, my girlfriend and I went to Safeway and bought three pounds of bacon for eight

2421
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:53,500
bucks and made bacon and pancakes for her mother on Mother's Day. It was very delicious

2422
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:56,620
and it was even more delicious knowing I was helping save Americans from idiots who think

2423
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:00,980
swine flu comes from cooked pork meat. You, sir, are American of the week. Thank you very

2424
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:08,700
much. Round of applause, please. Who is this emailer? AZHP. AZHP. You, sir. I'm actually

2425
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:12,700
a model citizen. I've actually been trying to think of my next big thing that I'm going

2426
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:16,360
to do. And because, you know, it is the summer and, you know, ice cream stuff, we had this

2427
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:21,160
where we do these questions of the week type thing and they're all what custom ice cream

2428
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:25,260
flavor would you want? And no, not baking, because that's I mean, seriously, that tastes

2429
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:29,180
like crap. I mean, you just can't. So I don't know. I don't know. Something baking cannot

2430
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:34,100
make sense. I'm buying it up, but candies, bacon, ice cream, ice cream recipe. No, that's

2431
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:42,700
not good. But I thought of a waffle breakfast ice cream. Follow me. Oh, my God. This sounds

2432
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:49,380
amazing. Follow me with this. Waffle ice cream? You have waffle ice cream comb bits in there

2433
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:55,120
mixed in there, maple syrup, vanilla ice cream. And because you have to and I know this probably

2434
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:59,860
would not be good, but a little bit of butter dripped in there, you know, just because you

2435
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:03,460
need that butter flavor. Otherwise, you might be able to mix it with the maple syrup. Oh,

2436
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:09,660
I thought about waffle ice cream and I jizzed in my pants. Wow. Oh, I see it's the alcohol

2437
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:13,220
in here that makes us good. But I wonder if like if I brought like maple syrup and butter

2438
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:18,060
to like a cold stone or something like that, they could do that. Candied bacon ice cream.

2439
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:25,220
Hitstun in chat says this is why you're fat. Because I think of stuff. How rude. Oh, he

2440
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:31,620
followed it up with dot com. There is a website called this is why you're fat dot com. It's

2441
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:39,020
great. I'm also posting. It's dot com. That on my own Twitter, the candied bacon ice cream.

2442
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:44,140
There you go. All right. More emails. Sorry, we got to finish our all American email. Yes.

2443
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:49,420
P.S. Oh, no, there's more. Also, Dark Soccer mentioned on a podcast a few weeks that she

2444
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:53,700
enjoyed the Toy Story ride very much. I rode this ride back in July after a trip to Anime

2445
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:57,620
Expo and I thought it was awesome as well. I don't know if it will make your show roll

2446
01:53:57,620 --> 01:54:02,700
this week, but the game is slated to be released on the Wii in some form soon. I didn't know

2447
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:07,980
that. I have heard this. I have heard this and I have a friend who loves Disney and is

2448
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:11,100
going to be probably buying a Wii just to this day. The video is on the Internet already.

2449
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:15,540
Oh, my gosh. I want to I hear it's going to have 3D glasses. I was actually I was actually

2450
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:22,100
too stunned by another Wii release that I'll be covering later in the show to think about

2451
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:25,860
that. Everyone I'm looking forward to this game is I love the ride, but the line was

2452
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:31,000
atrocious. That's why you go right before park closes. No line. You get in the line

2453
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,220
and they close off the line. Anyway, love AZHP. P.S. I typed this all up on my palm

2454
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:40,220
tree or cell phone just to prove that you can write a grammatically correct email without

2455
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:48,740
the presence of a full keyboard. This is as I look it up. Yes, very well done. You're

2456
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:54,420
due to be commended. All American with good grammar. You're just like the citizen of the

2457
01:54:54,420 --> 01:55:00,740
week. Honestly, you win a shiny gold star. There you go. Last email. Can we can we have

2458
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:05,380
like maybe a wiki page gold star email recipients? Yeah. I mean, we should have something where

2459
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:12,220
someone make it like a special club for people who send just a plus quality emails and AZHP

2460
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:19,100
is the first inductee. Yes. Someone make it. I mean, my God. Bacon, grammar, everything

2461
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:29,060
all in one. You make it. I choose you. There you go. Okay. Last email. This is from Clone

2462
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:38,140
627. Hi, O.L.R. I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game against what game?

2463
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:42,180
I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game has been that it's too soon. But

2464
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:47,780
oh, didn't Army of Two start with the September 11th attack? So it's too soon for mutual war,

2465
01:55:47,780 --> 01:55:51,940
but not too soon for terrorist attack that killed tons of civilians. Just a thought.

2466
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:55,940
And I apologize if any spelling or grammar problems. My power is out and I'm typing this

2467
01:55:55,940 --> 01:56:02,140
on the iPhone. Sorry, you've just been owned by AZHP. Just letting you know that you've

2468
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:06,900
been you've been owned. Grammar has two A's. This must be about six days in Fallujah. I

2469
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:10,860
don't really think it's been two. I mean, I don't really care to be honest, you know,

2470
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:15,220
with how soon it was. I think we were just saying this too soon. That's probably why

2471
01:56:15,220 --> 01:56:21,220
they pulled it. You know, honestly, I wouldn't play it anyways, because it's it doesn't look

2472
01:56:21,220 --> 01:56:28,100
good. I mean, it might be good if you want to play that type of thing. But I don't know.

2473
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:32,180
We don't know Konami for you. They're epic war games.

2474
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:37,860
Do you remember how Manhunt 2, that game kind of generated all this controversy? It was

2475
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:42,420
like every week we had some goddamn story about Manhunt 2 and what country banned it

2476
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:49,140
this week. And then the game came out and it sucked. Yeah, I'm kind of reminded of that.

2477
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:53,220
You know, it's hard to say. I can't judge it till I play it. Six Days of Fallujah is

2478
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:58,420
not my type of game anyway. But I'm just saying, just because the game's always getting that

2479
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:01,620
buzz doesn't mean it's going to be worth it. Just saying.

2480
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:04,380
Well, I lied. There's one more email. It's a doozy.

2481
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,380
All righty.

2482
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:11,940
Hey, y'all. I had to say it the right way, you know. First of all, thank you, Rob, for

2483
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:15,940
getting the last podcast up in an expedient manner. I look forward to this being a trend

2484
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:18,340
and not an isolated occurrence. Thanks again.

2485
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:20,100
Well, look at you, Mr. Big Words.

2486
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,660
What if it's a Ms. Big Words?

2487
01:57:22,660 --> 01:57:23,660
Fair enough. You're in the way.

2488
01:57:23,660 --> 01:57:24,660
It actually is a Mr. Big Words.

2489
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:25,660
All right.

2490
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:30,260
Loki, congrats on the twins and thank you for your statement of not wanting to name

2491
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:33,860
your children after characters that populate one of your hobbies. I have-

2492
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:34,860
Yet.

2493
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:35,860
I have-

2494
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:38,260
It ain't over till it's over.

2495
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:43,060
Let me read. I have an uncle, a wrestling fan, who named his kids Austin and Hunter

2496
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:47,660
and he never hears the end of it. I know who he named him after, too, which is sad. Steve

2497
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,380
Austin and Triple H.

2498
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:55,060
Oh, my God. Yeah, not doing that.

2499
01:57:55,060 --> 01:57:59,820
I'm sure that if you act in the way that my uncle did, the ribbing will be exponentially

2500
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:04,260
worse. After all, there are lots of jackasses online, including this ginger kid who thinks

2501
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:09,660
he writes a hilarious blog. And, Jamie, let me join you in your assessment of Silent Hill

2502
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:13,700
3, although I did have to stop playing it near the end after getting overloaded with

2503
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:17,660
the imagery in the game. Oh, God. Hell, yes. Silent Hill 3 stands as one of my favorite

2504
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:23,060
PlayStation 2 games. I only hope that when I get around to playing Silent Hill Homecoming,

2505
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:27,180
it is fractionally as good as Silent Hill 3 and I'm gonna be starting that soon. I've

2506
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:30,180
got your copy still, Rob.

2507
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:31,180
Fun.

2508
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:35,780
Now, while I'm really emailing you, I didn't just message you to kiss your ass. I appreciate

2509
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:36,780
ass kissing, by the way.

2510
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:39,800
I know. You could have just kissed our ass and left it at that. We don't mind.

2511
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:43,780
I noticed something while I was playing Mirrors Edge recently. The first day I played it,

2512
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,860
I was getting into the game and looked forward to playing it more. The second day, I played

2513
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:51,660
it and enjoyed it more and more. What's the difference between the gaming sessions? Music.

2514
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:55,140
The first day, I listened to the in-game music, but the second day, I was listening to music

2515
01:58:55,140 --> 01:59:01,580
for my iPod, specifically Nine Inch Nails. I attribute this fact to... I attribute this

2516
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:07,980
fact to my enhanced... I think you meant enhanced and not enhanced enjoyment, especially since

2517
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:14,540
I spent the third day I was listening to Dresden Dolls and achieved a similar level of enjoyment.

2518
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:18,700
As I thought back along my history of playing games, I see my music being an integral part

2519
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:22,660
of my enjoyment. Whether it's listening to Social Distortion while playing Left 4 Dead,

2520
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:27,760
Cake, Beck, and Seal while playing Tiger Woods PGA, or Core Metallica and Rammstein while

2521
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:33,020
playing Final Fantasy VIII, the occasional monotony of playing games was eliminated from

2522
01:59:33,020 --> 01:59:36,620
me by listening to the music that I love. It makes me wonder how many of us have felt

2523
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:41,140
the same effect. That is the kind of question I pose to you three. I think it might be interesting

2524
01:59:41,140 --> 01:59:44,940
to hear the kinds of music you mix with the kinds of games that you play. Actually, just

2525
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:51,180
to say, I usually prefer the in-game music because I think that the games were... I...

2526
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:58,180
This is from being a musician myself. And actually being a person who is actually getting

2527
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:06,260
very much into experience and the identity of something, you know, has really been more

2528
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:11,100
recent transformation. But I think that the music is actually an integral part to the

2529
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:16,260
game. It's part of what defines the action, part of what ties everything in together.

2530
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:20,620
And yeah, a crap soundtrack can break a game, but it's still part of the experience, you

2531
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:27,620
know. So in that respect, I prefer to try it at least a few times through with the original

2532
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:32,900
music. And then if I've played it for a while, then I might try to find something else. You

2533
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:38,100
know what I mean? Yeah, I rarely use custom soundtracks. As cool as they are, I rarely

2534
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:41,740
use them, I find, actually. They're for racing games. That's just what I was going to get

2535
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:46,180
into. It's a Ridge Racer game. Racing games, I always seem to use custom soundtracks with.

2536
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:50,660
And I like to do like driving type of techno, like, you know, boo boo boo boo boo boo. Just

2537
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:55,000
throw in the Won Gun CDs. It was serious. Actually, I've done that. I love playing

2538
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,340
Burnout with the Won Gun music. It's pretty fun. But here's a curveball for you. One thing

2539
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:04,580
I like to do, World of Warcraft, obviously, you know I play that game. And you know, even

2540
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:08,060
though I agree pretty much with what Jamie said, the soundtrack to World of Warcraft

2541
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:12,100
gets a little old. You've kind of heard all the same songs over and over and over again.

2542
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:16,280
I like to listen to talk radio while I play World of Warcraft. There's a particular political

2543
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:20,340
talk show I listen to in the evenings. I like to listen to that and play World of Warcraft.

2544
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:23,900
And what I do is I have the talk show play through my headphones, and then I have WoW

2545
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:27,260
playing through my speakers, so I can kind of hear both, but I'm not being distracted

2546
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:31,860
by the game noises. That's actually kind of the way I've been gaming lately, like that.

2547
02:01:31,860 --> 02:01:35,980
But rarely, yeah, for the same reasons, especially with a lot of games coming out right now that

2548
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:39,740
have the very driving soundtracks like Space Invaders Xtreme and things like that that have

2549
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:45,740
the thumpin' soundtracks. I don't really like to switch it out.

2550
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:52,540
Yeah, sorry. If anyone picked that up, Rob's using my stylus as a mouse.

2551
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:58,780
It's fine. Now I'm fidgeting with it, even though it's super expensive. But yes. Anyway,

2552
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:02,980
that's pretty much my answer to the question, is that I do talk radio, if anything else.

2553
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:08,940
Well, there are some games that, just after having played them for a long time, I will

2554
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:12,740
listen to other stuff, but really it has to be something that I've played for a long time.

2555
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:17,720
Or actually, I'll do it when I play RO, because after a while, the music in-game really freakin'

2556
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:18,720
gets on my nerves.

2557
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:21,940
Yeah, I mean, a lot of MMOs, I'm sure, are like that, you know, just even if it's...

2558
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:24,780
But I didn't do it for other games. I didn't do it for World of Warcraft, and I didn't

2559
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:26,660
do it for Final Fantasy XI.

2560
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:30,500
You probably didn't play them enough. I didn't for the first year.

2561
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:33,420
I played long enough to know that I hated being a freakin' white mage!

2562
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:36,660
Alright, any more emails, or is that it?

2563
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:39,660
That, um, oh, there's more.

2564
02:02:39,660 --> 02:02:40,660
Oh dear.

2565
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:41,660
Just a little more, just a little more.

2566
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:42,660
Alright.

2567
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:46,020
Well, that's all. I hope that this wasn't too long and that I used semicolons in a way

2568
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:49,740
that is effective and grammatically correct. After all, I didn't used to use that particular

2569
02:02:49,740 --> 02:02:53,900
piece of punctuation in school. Thank you for your time, Reddertainment. This message

2570
02:02:53,900 --> 02:03:00,580
has been brought to you by my Who Killed Amanda Palmer, the solo debut by Amanda Palmer, fucking

2571
02:03:00,580 --> 02:03:04,220
awesome, and by Olive Garden, my grandma's favorite way to catch food poisoning.

2572
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:09,420
Alright, there you go. Free plug for an indie artist there, something worked in.

2573
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:10,740
I'm down for that.

2574
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:11,740
By the way, uh...

2575
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:13,420
Oh my god.

2576
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:14,420
What's that?

2577
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:17,140
Amanda totally trumped my bacon ice cream.

2578
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:18,340
What'd she get?

2579
02:03:18,340 --> 02:03:19,340
Bacon cinnamon rolls.

2580
02:03:19,340 --> 02:03:20,340
That's pretty amazing.

2581
02:03:20,340 --> 02:03:21,340
I don't know.

2582
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:22,340
Bacon dessert doesn't seem to go well.

2583
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:23,340
That looks delicious.

2584
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:24,340
Bacon is meat candy.

2585
02:03:24,340 --> 02:03:25,340
Bacon is meat candy.

2586
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:26,340
Nice.

2587
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:27,340
.com.

2588
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:35,340
Alright. Is that registered yet? Bacon is meat candy dot com? Take a look. Alright,

2589
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:39,340
anyhow, I've been promising an all night long list giveaway.

2590
02:03:39,340 --> 02:03:49,780
Smile DK, autographing a copy of Darren's Dance Revolution Supernova 2.

2591
02:03:49,780 --> 02:03:54,820
The five songs we played on the last show we had two weeks ago, Don't Clock Me, Have

2592
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:59,380
You Never Been Mellow, the M.M. Groovin' mix. That was the faster mix of the song.

2593
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:03,580
In the Heat of the Night, Rain of Sorrow, and the song you just heard there in the background,

2594
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:06,820
Dancing All Alone. Those were the songs. Of course, we had to have a song in there by Smile

2595
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:13,500
DK. We had a few people get it right. I had Bobby, our buddy who is on before us, pick

2596
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:19,980
a number, and he picked the number two. So we grabbed the second email, and the winner

2597
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:25,780
of the Smile DK autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2. This is a pretty big prize, so drum roll

2598
02:04:25,780 --> 02:04:29,780
please, people please.

2599
02:04:29,780 --> 02:04:36,060
The winner is, the winner does not have an alias, so the winner is Lindsay, Lindsay B.

2600
02:04:36,060 --> 02:04:39,900
Send in an email that has the right songs all there. I don't know if she's listening

2601
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:44,340
right now, but there it is. Lindsay B. won. Congratulations. I will be sending you an

2602
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:50,700
email. Please make sure we get your address so we can tell Breslil where to send the prize.

2603
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:56,820
Lindsay B. wins the autographed Smile DK. So congrats. Congrats to you.

2604
02:04:56,820 --> 02:05:00,500
All right. Let's get back into some gaming news then.

2605
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,460
Do we gotta?

2606
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:03,460
Yes we gotta.

2607
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:04,460
Woohoo.

2608
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:13,660
Well, it's kind of funny. The DSi, you know, that system didn't seem to be, wasn't able

2609
02:05:13,660 --> 02:05:22,740
to be hacked for a while there, but it was only for a while. Apparently a new DSi working

2610
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:32,580
cart from Supercard, they have a new one now, Supercard DS1i, and that actually now works

2611
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:38,300
with the DSi and, you know, features all the wonderful ways to get around their different

2612
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:43,000
security measures, including all the future ones that may come, because they actually

2613
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:48,500
have for the first time a way to update the firmware on the card. And this is independent

2614
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:54,260
of actually, because usually with these cards you have to use a micro SD card and you, you

2615
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:57,900
know, run a program on there and you update the program and that kind of stuff. Well,

2616
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:03,340
now you can actually update the firmware on the card itself using the included USB adapter

2617
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:12,500
and so, in theory, this could be unpatchable at some point. And I know that there was some

2618
02:06:12,500 --> 02:06:19,580
more information out there about some new methods that they're going to be implementing

2619
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:26,580
in upcoming DSi games, and we'll get into more of that in a little bit, but that might

2620
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:31,980
make that a little bit harder to work. Well, do we always kind of know, like, whenever

2621
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:38,500
they say something can't be pirated within five minutes, it is, right? Yeah. So, and

2622
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:44,500
Act F says it in chat right there, you can't stop the homebrew community. You just can't.

2623
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:49,700
So, I guess that's it then. DSi has already been cracked, and how long has it been out?

2624
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:55,940
Two weeks? Three weeks? Well, a little while if you count Japan. No, I guess that's true.

2625
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:59,900
Well, some more E3 news. We talked a lot about some great E3 news earlier in the show, but

2626
02:06:59,900 --> 02:07:06,820
this not so great news. Well, depending on who you're a fan of. Atari, the once great

2627
02:07:06,820 --> 02:07:14,100
makers of the 2600 system, a landmark in gaming, has pulled out of E3. Atari will not be attending

2628
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:20,940
E3 this year, so sadly, no Ghostbusters, Champions Online, or any of that on the show floor.

2629
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:25,540
Although Atari does still feel that E3 is beneficial to the industry, they are focused

2630
02:07:25,540 --> 02:07:32,640
on quote, other selling and marketing initiatives. So, there you go. Sadly, Atari has pulled

2631
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:38,140
out of the show. And what's interesting, Atari was always kind of like, every year I went

2632
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:43,140
to E3 anyway, Atari was always kind of a satellite room. They were never really on the show floor.

2633
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:46,800
Them and Midway always had satellite rooms. So, it'll be interesting to see what happens

2634
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:52,640
this year. Oh, there you go. Let's hope Ghostbusters sells lots and lots of copies for Atari or

2635
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:56,220
else who knows if they'll be in existence by this time next year for E3. That would

2636
02:07:56,220 --> 02:08:01,780
be a very sad day. That would just be the end of an era. Indeed, but Sega not putting

2637
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:05,160
out hardware anymore was the end of an era of sorts. Well, you know, there's something

2638
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:11,980
else though that makes me think that Nintendo hasn't forgotten the sum of its earlier games.

2639
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:18,100
And it's a game that's called Muscle March, and that's just put out by Namco. It's a game

2640
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:28,100
that's sort of like a puzzle game meets a Mario Kart meets some weird Simon Says sort

2641
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:34,860
of game. Sunshine and rainbows. Oh, and muscle-bound men and an overly-muscled woman. Can I play

2642
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:38,320
a little bit of the trailer here? Does it have happy, sunshiny music to go with the

2643
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:49,540
little picture here? Let me fast forward a little bit here. Oh my gosh, this game looks

2644
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:56,340
silly. I'm getting it. I wish. This looks like Incredible Crisis, but with incredibly

2645
02:08:56,340 --> 02:09:04,020
scantily clad muscle men. No, it's like, do you see how you have to pose the right way?

2646
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:11,260
It's human Tetris. Oh God, it's that thing. It's like that game show. Yeah. Oh my God.

2647
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:15,260
Ellen does this on her show all the time. Basically, the premise of this story starts

2648
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:21,620
off with a football player, like American football, stealing their protein powder. And

2649
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:27,940
so they're chasing after the football player, and as you can see here, an alien takes it

2650
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:32,100
once they catch the football player. They have to chase after the alien. And basically

2651
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:36,860
the alien and the football player and the guys are running through different walls,

2652
02:09:36,860 --> 02:09:41,220
and you have to pose the way he posed when you go through the wall. And there's a panda

2653
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:46,460
bear. Or, what was that? A polar bear. And there is a muscle woman, too, if you're looking

2654
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:51,540
for that. But they're running on rainbow trails. I mean, this game is too gay for me. This

2655
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:58,260
game totally reeks of Cho Aniki. Just without being a... I'll get this. And I'm completely

2656
02:09:58,260 --> 02:10:04,980
secure in my homosexuality when I say that. This game looks way too gay for me. I want

2657
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:12,300
this game. Hey, it's what, only 800 Wii points? I guess so. And that's what, May 29th or something

2658
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:19,580
in Japan? Yep. So, in fact, I will actually link the article from Joystiq in the chat

2659
02:10:19,580 --> 02:10:26,380
room so that our listeners who are with us live can see it. Bobby Blackwolf says they

2660
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:30,220
should put that on the box. You know how they always quote people from magazines and trade

2661
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:34,020
publications? They put it on the box. Even though this is a download title. They should

2662
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:38,200
put that right there on the box. This game is too gay for me. Rob Roberts. I would be

2663
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:42,300
fine with that. I would be completely fine with that. I mean, I guess I should play it

2664
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:46,980
before I can definitively say that, but seriously, it's probably, if I were to play it, it would

2665
02:10:46,980 --> 02:10:56,300
be even gayer. But it's... the game is... yeah. And there's also this particular place

2666
02:10:56,300 --> 02:11:00,660
where it freezes the screen. There's a giraffe poking its head out of the clouds and a pig

2667
02:11:00,660 --> 02:11:08,940
flying and muscle-bound men pointing. And gay sex. Lots of butt sex. Surprise butt sex.

2668
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:14,380
Ahh! That's the sound of surprise butt sex, by the way. That's the bonus level. Surprise!

2669
02:11:14,380 --> 02:11:21,060
Yeah. Well, you think that's pretty surprising. Well then, here's something else that'll blow

2670
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:28,140
your mind. Apparently someone's actually... Yes, apparently someone has developed a pill

2671
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:35,420
that will enhance your first person shooter plane. It's called the FPS Brain Pill. And

2672
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:45,140
apparently it will make you see better, I guess. It's a visual performance enhancing

2673
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:56,180
capsule. And I guess when caffeine and guarana are not enough. I don't know. For when staying

2674
02:11:56,180 --> 02:12:02,380
up until 9 o'clock in the morning playing World of Warcraft just isn't long enough.

2675
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:08,900
Well this way you can see better. Maybe this will make you see dead people. Maybe this

2676
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:14,140
will give you a heart attack, is what might happen. I don't know. Deathwishing in the

2677
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:21,820
chatroom asks, chat.orangessauce.com asks, so basically it's caffeine? No, it's not.

2678
02:12:21,820 --> 02:12:26,740
It's made up of complex ingredients which nurture the human eye. Oh, well I'm sorry.

2679
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:32,620
With essential micronutrients that are not sufficiently produced by the body on its own.

2680
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:40,220
These and among other trace elements, plant extracts, cartonoids which strengthen and

2681
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:48,620
protect the eyes when they're under particular strain. Gamers often sit in front of their

2682
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:54,260
screens for hours during the night, especially for them. A sufficient nutrition of the body

2683
02:12:54,260 --> 02:13:00,440
with vital substance that actively support the eyes as a precondition for healthy and

2684
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:06,940
effective eyesight. And blah blah blah. Actually, looking through this, these are basically

2685
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:15,300
the same things that you find in those eye formulas. There's actually some really good

2686
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:19,900
stuff in here, but really lutein, lycopene, eat a tomato, shit. Eat a tomato every day.

2687
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:26,180
You'll be fine. Or take a multivitamin. Multivitamins don't have quite that concentration. It's

2688
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:31,580
still a way to get gamers to take their vitamins, you know, just eat a fucking tomato. Well,

2689
02:13:31,580 --> 02:13:35,500
you can buy it and they have a 110% money back guarantee, so if you don't like it, then

2690
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:45,300
you get more money. Cool! I don't like it. Prenatal vitamins. Alright, wait, are you

2691
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:50,140
suggesting gamers should take prenatal vitamins? Actually, the stuff that's in prenatal vitamins

2692
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:55,260
are pretty freaking good for, you know, keeping the body healthy and hand-eye coordination.

2693
02:13:55,260 --> 02:14:00,140
Also, it's really good for your hair. Okay, as long as I don't get pregnant. No! That

2694
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:06,060
has got to be the single most dumb buddy thing I've ever heard you say. Really? Because I've

2695
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:12,540
said a lot in the history of this program. I've said, shut up! I've said a lot of dumb

2696
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:19,020
things. Oh, but that's not all. See, that's FBS brain zoom. That's the, um, that, but

2697
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:24,540
apparently they also have some other stuff that enhances your reaction time, the FBS

2698
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:31,100
brain original. Fortunately, they do not sell anything that will enhance your penis size.

2699
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:34,980
That's the only thing they're really missing. I'm gonna tell everybody, all of our listeners,

2700
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:40,820
something right now. These ads are bullshit! These products that say they're gonna do this

2701
02:14:40,820 --> 02:14:47,420
shit, they don't do it! But 110% money back guarantee! That's a guarantee you can stick

2702
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:54,780
by! Hey, you get 110% back! That's more than 100%! And I'm not saying this as a representative

2703
02:14:54,780 --> 02:15:02,180
of the company. I did work at a GNC, and I've been involved in several natural home remedy,

2704
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:07,500
you know, courses. I do believe in natural healing, but none of this stuff is gonna be

2705
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:14,100
an instant fix. The way you improve your hand-eye coordination is using your hands and eyes

2706
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:19,540
together more. You coordinate them through practice. Um, faster reaction times are gonna

2707
02:15:19,540 --> 02:15:23,260
be done through training. It's not something that a pill's gonna do for you. And there

2708
02:15:23,260 --> 02:15:31,620
is absolutely zero, no way to grow a bigger dick. It doesn't happen. You cannot use a

2709
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:37,980
vacuum tube. You cannot use pills. You could do it surgically. That's about it. And that's

2710
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:39,780
not you growing it.

2711
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:45,340
Alright. Well, there is no pill that will make you a better dancer. That's for sure,

2712
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:47,380
right? There's no pill that will make you a better dancer.

2713
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:49,460
I know plenty of people who could use it if it existed.

2714
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:53,380
But possibly Dance Dance Revolution will make you a better dancer, although I'll tell you

2715
02:15:53,380 --> 02:15:57,240
from first-hand experience it does not. But if you want to try anyway, there might be

2716
02:15:57,240 --> 02:16:01,360
a game coming out a little later for you this year that could be a good starter kit. It's

2717
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:06,280
Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1 is apparently the game. Of course, take this with a grain

2718
02:16:06,280 --> 02:16:09,780
of salt. Konami's not confirming this yet, but apparently some information's leaked out

2719
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:15,540
this week that the Wii will be getting this game as well as the Xbox 360 and a debut on

2720
02:16:15,540 --> 02:16:21,180
the PlayStation 3. Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1, it's a best of. That's right, they

2721
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:27,860
are going to be pulling some of the best songs from DDR's history and putting it all into

2722
02:16:27,860 --> 02:16:32,700
one game. Here's hoping it's not just the Konami originals, because we did already have

2723
02:16:32,700 --> 02:16:36,100
that game several years ago. It was called Konamiics, but I guess it was the first.

2724
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:40,700
And best hits. Best hits didn't come out in the US. I know, but it's still the same thing.

2725
02:16:40,700 --> 02:16:45,860
I know, this is a little snore, you know, but I guess it's a starter kit for new people,

2726
02:16:45,860 --> 02:16:50,780
whatever. Way to go. That took no effort. You didn't have to have any more, you know,

2727
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:54,580
step charts made. You just said, okay, I want this, this, this, this, this. Let's say it's

2728
02:16:54,580 --> 02:17:01,300
Konami originals, we can take all that. And we're done. By the way, I just want to say

2729
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:05,020
Chat is kind of going a little haywire right now. We do tape live on Sunday nights and

2730
02:17:05,020 --> 02:17:08,900
live things happen. Apparently there's just been an earthquake in Southern California.

2731
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:13,980
Some of our Southern California listeners are saying, whoa, did you feel that one? So

2732
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:18,980
they're saying on the quake site, it was a 4.7, which I don't believe is too bad. That's

2733
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:23,620
just a little wake up call. Let's hope this doesn't, this isn't a, what do they call it?

2734
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:27,880
A pre-quake or what? No, not an aftershock, but a pre-shock to something that's going

2735
02:17:27,880 --> 02:17:31,540
to happen in three weeks. Cause that would suck. I don't know. Don't die. I don't want

2736
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:39,860
to be in LA when fear not. It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over. Shut up. She lives

2737
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:45,440
in Florida anyway. Exactly. It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over dark soccer. Please

2738
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:53,860
save this show from a Loki. There's going to be another Tony Hawk game. Who cares? Actually,

2739
02:17:53,860 --> 02:18:01,580
this is going to be a peripheral based game and, um, it's going to be called, um, Tony

2740
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:11,140
Hawk Ride. And yeah, this thing is weird. It's going to be on Wii, PS3, and 360. So

2741
02:18:11,140 --> 02:18:17,500
I don't know. I don't really care. Hitstone would like you to know that he cares. There

2742
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:23,820
you go. Okay. Then you can go check out the official website at thride.com. Yes. And it's

2743
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:31,420
a big old skateboard controller as rumored numerous times before. No one's surprised.

2744
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:35,180
Yeah. Um, I, I'm like, when I heard this this week, I was like, I thought we already heard

2745
02:18:35,180 --> 02:18:40,000
this, but I guess it was just kinda under the radar before. But, uh, yep. Yet another

2746
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,940
peripheral to fill up your house. There you go. A skateboard controller. Maybe I'll have

2747
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:48,900
to get it on top of the boxes. I knew it. Dark soccer. The minute she hears, Oh, peripheral.

2748
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:53,780
She's like, ah, fuck. I got to get this. No, the only way, you know what? There is one

2749
02:18:53,780 --> 02:18:57,580
game. I would have wanted something like that for, and that was, what was it called? Air

2750
02:18:57,580 --> 02:19:03,260
tricks. The Sega skateboarding game. That would have been cool. Otherwise, no, you know

2751
02:19:03,260 --> 02:19:07,620
what? They should put out the skateboard controller and then they should put out jet set radio,

2752
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:14,380
like a new version of it. Would that not, especially with the Wii, huh? Hey, except

2753
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:23,900
you are roller bleeding. You know what? Hater haters to the left, please. Thank you. So

2754
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:30,780
that it's a sequel. Now they're on skateboards. It's a little different. That is lame. I hate

2755
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:35,740
you. Just a couple more stories. Then we'll be taking your phone calls. A one eight seven

2756
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:42,100
seven game. Oh, LR. Not just yet though. Let you know when. So, um, as I alluded to earlier,

2757
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:47,900
they're a metaphoric. They're, um, I guess a former game developer, and now they're frustrated

2758
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:55,300
by piracy. So they have come up with a new, um, technique that will basically, um, allow

2759
02:19:55,300 --> 02:20:00,020
each game that's put out to have a different security scheme. And it basically turns the

2760
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:06,260
game into its own security system. And it apparently does a check with some data that's

2761
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:11,260
stored on the cart. Something that's going to be broken really fast, basically, but will

2762
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:16,920
hopefully delay releases and that kind of stuff. I don't think it's going to, but not

2763
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:22,280
related to the story. And I'm going to bring it up anyways right now. We may have talked

2764
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:29,260
about it a little bit before Kojima Productions has a new teaser page for some secret project.

2765
02:20:29,260 --> 02:20:36,420
And wouldn't you know it? There is something that looks like a five or possibly an S. So

2766
02:20:36,420 --> 02:20:44,020
we're either going to get a snatcher game or maybe Metal Gear Solid 5. Uh oh. With a

2767
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:50,740
new countdown. And maybe that's what they're going to show on the, uh, the press conference

2768
02:20:50,740 --> 02:20:54,620
that they're saying, you know, if, you know. Dude, you know they're going to fucking do

2769
02:20:54,620 --> 02:21:04,060
it. Maybe. I don't know. Who knows? We'll see. Interesting. Alright. Well, one more

2770
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:07,420
story for you guys and it's one more big, big, big rumor and then we're going to get

2771
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:12,940
to the calls. This could be interesting. A digital entertainment handheld that they say

2772
02:21:12,940 --> 02:21:20,060
will do absolutely everything if you are to believe the rumors about the Zune HD. That's

2773
02:21:20,060 --> 02:21:25,980
right. Uh, it was a report from Team Xbox apparently. The Zune HD allegedly is going

2774
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:31,320
to be revealed at E3. It's a portable game console and media player. It will link to

2775
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:37,100
the Skybox, another Microsoft system. It will integrate current Zune and Xbox marketplaces

2776
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:42,460
together and apparently something very similar to the NXC is going to be the function that

2777
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:48,240
kind of drives the handheld. So in a way it's their foray into handheld gaming but not really

2778
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:52,740
because it's still kind of like an iPod-ish type of device. It's still the Zune. But here's

2779
02:21:52,740 --> 02:21:57,460
the other big catch and this is why I'm kind of like, you know, very skeptical about this.

2780
02:21:57,460 --> 02:22:02,100
Personally, the Zune HD, you will also be able to play Xbox Live Arcade games either

2781
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:06,660
on your Xbox or your handheld. That's where I stop believing that this is true. I think

2782
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:12,140
that's too much. Well, no. It's not necessarily too much. Only certain games. It's not all

2783
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:18,060
games. Maybe certain newer games that are developed with both together. You know, just

2784
02:22:18,060 --> 02:22:24,140
like the XNA stuff. The XNA stuff you can develop for the Zune and for Xbox Live Arcade

2785
02:22:24,140 --> 02:22:27,820
and you use that same toolset but now you have that full Xbox Live Arcade games that

2786
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:32,380
are cross-compatible. I would believe that the XNA games would run on this but I don't

2787
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:36,320
know. I mean, they have some pretty elaborate shit on Xbox Live Arcade now. I just can't

2788
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:39,980
imagine you're going to have something with the power of an Xbox 360 in your pocket. You

2789
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:48,980
know how much noise that'll make? I mean, but really. So. We'll see. Frisbee is mad

2790
02:22:48,980 --> 02:22:53,020
that everything's getting called HD. He says, quit calling everything HD. Blah, blah, blah

2791
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:58,820
HD. That is kind of a generic name. Don't you think Microsoft could do better than that?

2792
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:02,340
Especially if they're calling their other thing the Fluid? Couldn't they call this the

2793
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:08,420
Zune Fluid or something? I don't know. It makes me think of P. Don't talk about that.

2794
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:12,380
I actually have to kind of go to the restroom and we got to take calls. So, we're going

2795
02:23:12,380 --> 02:23:17,780
to open up the Skype line now for your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is

2796
02:23:17,780 --> 02:23:23,300
OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2797
02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:28,380
Whoa, it's freezing up. Hi, it's freezing up. What's freezing up? Are you having another

2798
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:34,900
earthquake? Whoa, no. It's springing, but I'm called in. Oh, there we go. Hi, introduce

2799
02:23:34,900 --> 02:23:39,940
yourself for our listeners, please. It's Deathwishing. Hi, Deathwishing. Talk to Jamie while I go

2800
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:46,380
to the bathroom. Hi. Quick, follow him in there. We can tackle him. That's okay. I'd

2801
02:23:46,380 --> 02:23:52,700
rather not because the cat also uses that bathroom. So, what's up? Fuel. That racing

2802
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:57,580
game? Yeah. Fuel? Yeah, it's awesome. Or it looks awesome. Oh, I don't know. I'm on a

2803
02:23:57,580 --> 02:24:03,020
pre-order thing here and I can't decide which game to pre-order. It is Red Faction Guerrilla

2804
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:10,260
or Fuel and that looks like Motorstorm on steroids and then Red Faction's Red Faction.

2805
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:17,100
Well, it depends if you want a racing game or more of like, you know, a sandbox-y game.

2806
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:27,580
Or do I want Global Warming or Mars? Yeah. Global Warming for the win, I think. Yay.

2807
02:24:27,580 --> 02:24:35,020
On the other part, we need to strap down Rosie O'Donnell just to get that thought out. I'm

2808
02:24:35,020 --> 02:24:41,500
trying to think here, a little bit of shocker over here, you know what happened, but I'm

2809
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:48,860
still playing Street Fighter. I think that's all we need to know. Cool. Yeah. Who's actually

2810
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:57,400
your primary now? Primary? Yeah, entry-fighter. Your main person. Sagat. Sagat now. Really?

2811
02:24:57,400 --> 02:25:07,020
Any particular reason? Tiger uppercut. Is that all? Oh, and Tiger Knee. Looks like he's

2812
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:13,180
kicking him in the balls. Just way more hardcore. I'm still totally taken with using Sakura,

2813
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:19,580
of course. That's because your name's Dark Sakura. If she played more like the one from

2814
02:25:19,580 --> 02:25:28,820
SNK vs. Capcom with a really weird run into her uppercut, it'd be really cool. I haven't

2815
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:37,060
noticed that. She plays a lot like an interesting combination of Alpha 2, Alpha 3. Well, Street

2816
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:43,540
Fighter IV is my first real Street Fighter. What do you want, lazy? Go back and play Alpha

2817
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:52,640
2. But I'm a young kid. I have to stick with the young games. It makes me hip. That means

2818
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:56,820
you're doing research. You know what? Respect your elders. Hi, I'm back. Respect your elders.

2819
02:25:56,820 --> 02:26:01,940
You need to discover your roots of gaming. Seriously, go back and play Alpha 2. Young

2820
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:09,500
whippersnappers. Road Rash is better than every game out. Says you. Alright, says me.

2821
02:26:09,500 --> 02:26:16,860
What did I miss? You missed me wanting to tie down Rosie O'Donnell. Wait, are you in

2822
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:22,980
L.A., Death Wishing? Hainton Beach. So close enough, did you feel that earthquake? I ran

2823
02:26:22,980 --> 02:26:29,660
down the stairs. Wow, so it was pretty bad then, huh? Right as you guys were talking

2824
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:34,720
about the first person shooter pill, which, like I said, I have permanent eye improvement

2825
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:41,980
called glasses. You put them on and you get better vision. Some people in chat asked if

2826
02:26:41,980 --> 02:26:45,300
we felt the earthquake, but we're way too far away to feel an earthquake. Like the big

2827
02:26:45,300 --> 02:26:50,100
one could hit L.A. and we wouldn't feel it up here. Another gamer pill is called carrots.

2828
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:56,460
They help your eyesight. Carrots are pretty amazing, actually. And they do have pills

2829
02:26:56,460 --> 02:27:01,060
out there, actually, that's just carrots. Just make sure you get the right hole. But

2830
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:08,980
if you eat, wow, if you eat too many carrots, your face will turn orange. This is true.

2831
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:12,220
This happened to me when I was a kid. I want to look like an Oompa Loompa. It happened

2832
02:27:12,220 --> 02:27:19,860
to this person, too. Did you ever watch the Partridge Family? Danny Bonaduce? No, Susan

2833
02:27:19,860 --> 02:27:24,500
Day. Really? Yeah, she pretty much starved herself and ate nothing but carrots and she

2834
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:27,820
turned orange. This kid has no idea what the Partridge Family was. Do you know what the

2835
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:34,980
Partridge Family is? Huh? Oh, God. All right. Do you have any final thoughts before I let

2836
02:27:34,980 --> 02:27:44,980
you go? Should I pre-order Fuel or Red Faction Gorilla? Red Faction Gorilla. Okay. All right,

2837
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:51,880
bye. I'll see about that. Okay, but thanks, bye. I don't know, I just picked a better

2838
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:55,680
sounding one. I have no idea what those games are. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's

2839
02:27:55,680 --> 02:28:01,380
this? Hey, C1LE Ronmo. What's up, everyone? Hi, not much. I was just yelling at the previous

2840
02:28:01,380 --> 02:28:05,800
listener. Please tell me you know who the Partridge Family is. I grew up watching the

2841
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:11,780
Partridge Family. Come on, get happy. There's a song that we're singing. Don't. Come on,

2842
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:15,380
get happy. All right, come on. Everybody knows that one. All right, Ronmo, what's on your

2843
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:22,440
mind tonight, buddy? Did you Twitter from the bathroom? I did not Twitter from the bathroom.

2844
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:27,740
I left my phone in here, thank you very much. Okay, all right, all right, all right. It

2845
02:28:27,740 --> 02:28:33,940
was just a pee, too. It wasn't a poop, so it's a lot harder to Twitter while you pee.

2846
02:28:33,940 --> 02:28:38,180
And I'm afraid of getting the phone wet, so I wouldn't want to do that. You got a point

2847
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:48,060
there. I always have a point. The chat room's like, ah. Whatever. Anyhow, what's on your

2848
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:54,340
mind? Shirley, you didn't just call and ask me about my bathroom. Call him Shirley. Or

2849
02:28:54,340 --> 02:29:02,300
Shirley. Speak. Okay, last week I helped a friend download Patapon 2, and it kind of

2850
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:07,620
blew up in our faces. Like the game literally blew up in your face, or what happened? It

2851
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:14,660
was being held trying to download the software to our PFE. I don't understand. Like, what

2852
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:19,180
happened? All right, pretty much, we hooked it up to my laptop. I'm running Windows 7,

2853
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:24,060
so I figured, okay, it'll download. The Sony software stopped halfway and said, I'm running

2854
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:29,020
an unauthorized operating system, this will now shut down. After doing that twice, we

2855
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:34,500
went to an XP machine, started downloading everything, it started running, we downloaded

2856
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:41,380
Patapon, we walked out, we come back, the download timed out. Interesting. Why don't

2857
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:48,020
you try downloading it through the PSP? The funny thing is, it wouldn't let her update

2858
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:53,300
the firmware, she was running version 3.7 or something like that. Holy crap. Yeah, and

2859
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:58,220
we tried to update the firmware, and it was like, it says you're running the latest one.

2860
02:29:58,220 --> 02:30:01,240
Well it sounds like Sony's gonna sell tons of copies of this stuff with all these hurdles

2861
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:07,400
going on. I bet I can get that game faster then. This almost sounds like a challenge.

2862
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:11,980
Is it faster to download Patapon 2 legally or illegally? This should be like a challenge

2863
02:30:11,980 --> 02:30:18,020
we do on the show next week. That might be fun. Not for nothing, it took me like 30 minutes

2864
02:30:18,020 --> 02:30:23,660
to pull down Rock Band Unplugged. Did you finally get your copy of Patapon 2, or are

2865
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:27,420
you still kind of waiting? We got it for her, and she was really pissed about it because

2866
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:33,260
she didn't even realize that it was a downloadable title when she bought it. Oh, I see, she

2867
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:39,980
bought it at the store? Okay, gotcha. Interesting, well thanks for the heads up. I could probably

2868
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:44,140
have it in a minute, but I'm not going to. Do not waste the bandwidth in here. Alright,

2869
02:30:44,140 --> 02:30:48,660
so anyway, Rama, anything else you want to call in about tonight? Rock Band Unplugged

2870
02:30:48,660 --> 02:30:55,820
is pretty good, and Rob, in response to 9 people in the hotel room at ASEN, need I remind

2871
02:30:55,820 --> 02:31:01,220
you about Katakan? Yeah, but that room at Katakan was much bigger. Like, you had a suite

2872
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:07,460
at Katakan. We're talking like a standard two bed room at ASEN. I have stayed in rooms

2873
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:13,820
where they fed 15 people in there, and people sleep on shifts. I've done it. Oh my god,

2874
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:21,740
now I'm just, I'm too old for this. You know, no, I mean, and certainly no disrespect, I

2875
02:31:21,740 --> 02:31:25,740
had a lot of fun, and you know, I did finally get my sleep, but you know, I definitely,

2876
02:31:25,740 --> 02:31:28,800
you know, somebody said they could kind of see it in me on Saturday. I was definitely

2877
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:33,040
feeling tired just because, you know, so many people and so on, so it took me a while to

2878
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:38,620
catch up. I was so dead at work on Monday and Tuesday, it was not even funny. Like,

2879
02:31:38,620 --> 02:31:42,140
I took like a five hour nap. It was pretty disgusting. Did you call out because you had

2880
02:31:42,140 --> 02:31:46,900
the comp leg? No, I couldn't. You know, in my job, you can't really call in sick unless

2881
02:31:46,900 --> 02:31:52,020
you are like really, really sick, especially when you have huge important projects that

2882
02:31:52,020 --> 02:31:57,620
have to be done when you teach, so. Oh, okay. Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you

2883
02:31:57,620 --> 02:32:01,420
go so we can get some more calls, but have a good one, and hopefully the next convention

2884
02:32:01,420 --> 02:32:08,980
I go to, you'll be there. Most definitely. Alright, take care, buddy. Later. Later. 1-877-GAME-OLR,

2885
02:32:08,980 --> 02:32:12,420
our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but the calls are coming in back to back tonight.

2886
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:17,020
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D. Rob, how you

2887
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:21,860
doing? Not too shabby. Just got home from work, and I'm like, oh my God, has OrangeLoungeRadio

2888
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:25,980
taken calls yet? I don't know. We just started taking calls. You're just in time. I did talk

2889
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:29,820
earlier in the show, and I did congratulate you on your Street Fighter IV win at ASUM.

2890
02:32:29,820 --> 02:32:33,900
Thank you very much. And was talking a little bit about the experience in the hotel room

2891
02:32:33,900 --> 02:32:38,520
playing on the Xbox 360 and the two arcade sticks, which actually was a lot of fun. I

2892
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:42,380
almost want to get an arcade stick. They're nice. I mean, I never thought I'd be one of

2893
02:32:42,380 --> 02:32:45,540
those guys who actually takes arcade sticks, and I despise myself just a little bit more

2894
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:49,740
as a human being, just for actually being one of those people who uses an arcade stick,

2895
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:55,940
but it's worth it. How did your panel go? I never got to ask. It went really well. I

2896
02:32:55,940 --> 02:32:59,780
mean, people really got a huge kick out of it, and we ended up getting pretty much in

2897
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:06,140
almost full room at the biggest panel room at the convention, short of the main programming

2898
02:33:06,140 --> 02:33:10,760
area where they have thousands of seats and that sort of thing. That's amazing. Congratulations.

2899
02:33:10,760 --> 02:33:15,260
I have to admit I'm a little jealous. And I actually just found out that I have a panel

2900
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:19,700
at Otacon, so that's going to be interesting. Wow. Well, go you. I mean, the stuff I saw,

2901
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:23,380
I didn't get to see the panel. I wish you guys would have taped it or something, but

2902
02:33:23,380 --> 02:33:30,140
I do have a tape. It's not great quality because it was taken on a really small digital camera.

2903
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:36,940
I think Misty taped it. Misty gave it to one of Jason, the crazy kid's brothers. Gotcha.

2904
02:33:36,940 --> 02:33:41,380
I have the video. I think I'm going to end up subtitling it and seeing how that turns

2905
02:33:41,380 --> 02:33:45,060
out because you can hardly hear anything. Or if you're going to do the same thing at

2906
02:33:45,060 --> 02:33:48,900
the next panel, take a better camera next time. Be ready. Be ready with a video camera.

2907
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:53,740
It would be fun. Oh, yeah. But that's great. The stuff I saw, tell the listeners, because

2908
02:33:53,740 --> 02:33:56,620
we're talking about this panel. Nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about. Tell the

2909
02:33:56,620 --> 02:34:01,060
listeners a little bit about what you did at this panel that had a full crowd. Well,

2910
02:34:01,060 --> 02:34:06,140
last year when we went to Otacon, we saw this Sonic the Hedgehog panel, and I laugh if they

2911
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:09,580
actually listen to this, although I doubt it. And they did a terrible, terrible job.

2912
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:13,640
The whole thing was basically the people who did it took a timeline of the Sonic games

2913
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:17,780
and was like, oh, and then Sonic Shovel came out. Who doesn't remember Sonic Shovel? And

2914
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:21,660
then everyone would go, woo! And that was pretty much it. And it sucked. So we decided,

2915
02:34:21,660 --> 02:34:25,780
okay, if they're going to do bad video game panels, let's make a good video game panel.

2916
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:29,180
And we realized, what would people actually want to hear about? What would people laugh

2917
02:34:29,180 --> 02:34:34,380
at that they don't really know about? So we decided to compile a list of some of the worst

2918
02:34:34,380 --> 02:34:39,340
writing and some of the worst examples of video game tropes. And we decided to do a

2919
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:45,540
little presentation about it and compile an hour-long thing about it with slides, with

2920
02:34:45,540 --> 02:34:49,820
pre-written stuff. And it turned out really well. We have a whole section on stupid Mega

2921
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:54,300
Man robot masters, bad video game covers, the introduction of Blaster Master and the

2922
02:34:54,300 --> 02:35:00,900
Americanization of it, where instead of having this basic storyline of this guy battling

2923
02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:05,900
in a post-apocalyptic world in this Gundam, well, not Gundam-style tank, but in this whole

2924
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:09,580
one technologically advanced tank that's so much better than everything else, how they

2925
02:35:09,580 --> 02:35:16,140
localize that into this kid is chasing after his giant frog that just turned giant because

2926
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:20,420
this radioactive box that just happened to be in his front yard. And he decided to jump

2927
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:25,460
down a hole and find this tank and start blowing up this underground society he knows nothing

2928
02:35:25,460 --> 02:35:31,680
about. It's great, really. And this is completely true? Yes. Wow. And see, the thing is that

2929
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:36,420
I love Blaster Master. It's one of my favorite NES games, definitely my top five. And I never

2930
02:35:36,420 --> 02:35:41,580
knew this. I just never thought to research it. I just accepted the FX9 novelization as

2931
02:35:41,580 --> 02:35:47,860
gospel and never realized there was this whole other real story behind it. It's amazing.

2932
02:35:47,860 --> 02:35:51,820
Yeah, it's hilarious. And like I said, we did a huge list of it. And actually, we still

2933
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:56,260
have material left over. And we've actually even gotten some good ideas from some of the

2934
02:35:56,260 --> 02:36:00,300
people attending our panel as well. We always ask at the end to see if anyone has anything

2935
02:36:00,300 --> 02:36:04,100
else. Honestly, if we wanted to do a two-hour panel and wanted to put in the work for that,

2936
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:09,980
we probably could. So you're traveling video game comics. This is pretty amazing. Yeah,

2937
02:36:09,980 --> 02:36:14,100
it's fun so far. We'll see how long we do it and how many cons we can do it at. Basically,

2938
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:17,940
if you'll give us a free badge and we can find cheap hotel, we'll do it. Well, hey,

2939
02:36:17,940 --> 02:36:23,280
there you go. You know what? Maybe we need to start working on something for Fanime 2010.

2940
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:29,280
We want to, but California's a little bit far away from us Illinois boys. Take a look

2941
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:34,340
at Southwest out of Midway. They have some direct flights. We'll work on that for next

2942
02:36:34,340 --> 02:36:39,860
year. All right, do that. Anyhow, Rob D, any other con thoughts or thoughts in general

2943
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:45,260
you want to share tonight? Oh man, the convention was a lot of fun. Actually, it's funny. After

2944
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:49,060
finals, because I had a couple finals to take right after, I really just need another break

2945
02:36:49,060 --> 02:36:52,340
from reality. So I'm actually going to be going to Anime North, although I have no panel

2946
02:36:52,340 --> 02:36:57,580
this weekend. You're just a blood for punishment with these two. I'm a con whore at this point.

2947
02:36:57,580 --> 02:37:02,980
I have nothing else to say about that. It'll be my first trip to Canada in a good 10 years.

2948
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:08,060
Part of me, even though I'm not doing anything at Fanime, I do kind of want to go just to

2949
02:37:08,060 --> 02:37:11,740
kind of peek. Part of me thinks I might end up there at least one day just kind of looking

2950
02:37:11,740 --> 02:37:15,860
around because I'm supposed to be in the Bay Area anyway. But we'll see. We'll see. I'm

2951
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:20,500
a little iffy right now. Maybe they'll have a game room that doesn't have half the TVs

2952
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:26,380
turned off. Fanime always has a really good game room, actually. So we'll see. We'll see.

2953
02:37:26,380 --> 02:37:31,960
But I have a lot going on next weekend. We'll see. There's a lot. Rob, any other thoughts

2954
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:32,960
for our listeners before I let you go?

2955
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:35,860
Well, I'd love to talk about Tatsunoko versus Capcom and how we're actually getting some

2956
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:40,580
Tatsu with some, you know, I can play as Ryu and Ken. Oh, wait. Wait, not that Ken. But

2957
02:37:40,580 --> 02:37:46,380
no, I'm excited for that coming to the U.S. or at least very, you know, almost confirmed

2958
02:37:46,380 --> 02:37:47,380
for the U.S. if nothing else.

2959
02:37:47,380 --> 02:37:51,580
Now, since you just joined us, did you hear that they have kind of looked at one of the

2960
02:37:51,580 --> 02:37:55,860
screenshots and you can tell that three characters have already been axed, which we kind of figured

2961
02:37:55,860 --> 02:37:58,500
was going to, you know, we said when we were kind of talking about this earlier in the

2962
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:03,140
show, we were like, well, wait a minute. Maybe they got the licensing, but don't guarantee

2963
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:07,440
that they got all of it. And sure enough, three of the characters have been cut, apparently.

2964
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:10,700
That's interesting. I didn't know about that. I'll have to look into that. But I guess it's

2965
02:38:10,700 --> 02:38:14,460
not too surprising considering that's just a nightmare in the U.S. and any other country

2966
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:15,460
other than Japan.

2967
02:38:15,460 --> 02:38:18,940
Exactly. And folks are asking again which characters got axed. Do you remember, Loki,

2968
02:38:18,940 --> 02:38:21,340
or where you read that? Do you remember who the ones were?

2969
02:38:21,340 --> 02:38:23,740
One of them was Condorno Joe.

2970
02:38:23,740 --> 02:38:33,260
It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and... I don't remember the last one.

2971
02:38:33,260 --> 02:38:36,580
R something real. Riolo? I don't remember.

2972
02:38:36,580 --> 02:38:37,580
Yeah, Ryu.

2973
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:38,580
Exactly, Ryu.

2974
02:38:38,580 --> 02:38:39,580
No, not Ryu.

2975
02:38:39,580 --> 02:38:40,580
Ryu won't be in there.

2976
02:38:40,580 --> 02:38:41,580
Licensing for Ryu.

2977
02:38:41,580 --> 02:38:44,060
Somebody in chat will yell it out in just a moment. That's what usually happens once

2978
02:38:44,060 --> 02:38:45,700
they get through the delay.

2979
02:38:45,700 --> 02:38:49,580
Will Kiyop from Battle of the Planets be in there or Ace Goodheart from G-Force?

2980
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:50,580
Sorry.

2981
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:52,580
I don't think everybody else is still in there.

2982
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:53,580
We'll see.

2983
02:38:53,580 --> 02:38:59,500
Anyway, Rob, we better let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks for the call

2984
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:03,300
and congratulations again and good luck with your traveling band of comedy.

2985
02:39:03,300 --> 02:39:05,260
Thank you very much. I'll see you later.

2986
02:39:05,260 --> 02:39:08,420
All right. Take care, buddy.

2987
02:39:08,420 --> 02:39:13,740
We got time for a couple more calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2988
02:39:13,740 --> 02:39:18,180
We can probably squeeze at least one more call in before the night's up. Go ahead and

2989
02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:21,740
give us a call. Do we have any last minute stories real quick before we say good night?

2990
02:39:21,740 --> 02:39:23,740
Yes, I've been collecting them.

2991
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:28,540
Hold on. We got a call. Hi, Aaron. OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2992
02:39:28,540 --> 02:39:29,540
It's GS68.

2993
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:33,980
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

2994
02:39:33,980 --> 02:39:37,260
Don't bother responding to me next year. I think ASEN needs more of your attention.

2995
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:38,260
Wait. What's this?

2996
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:46,340
Don't bother responding to me. Nobody in front of Bay Area was able to overlap with me.

2997
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:49,980
I know. We've skipped out on the past two years. It just hasn't worked out, but dude,

2998
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:53,580
ASEN is expensive to go to. I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it again next

2999
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:56,180
year, so I definitely want to keep it local, I think.

3000
02:39:56,180 --> 02:40:08,060
Well, at least listeners would go to ASEN, but I don't know anyone who would go to...

3001
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:13,100
I know anyone who would go to find me if all of them wasn't doing it on our panel.

3002
02:40:13,100 --> 02:40:16,780
Well, if we plugged it more because we're going, we might get it. The one year we did

3003
02:40:16,780 --> 02:40:22,780
do a panel, we had an okay turnout. It was nice. It was cool to meet some people. Plus,

3004
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:26,580
something else to consider, there's a lot of our old DDR buddies are really involved

3005
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:30,060
with Fonami, which is why I'm not going to talk negative about the con because I have

3006
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:32,780
nothing negative to say. It's just the timing never seems to work out because they do it

3007
02:40:32,780 --> 02:40:35,160
on a really busy weekend.

3008
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:40,700
But a lot of our old DDR buddies are very heavily involved with Fonami. Wendell is still

3009
02:40:40,700 --> 02:40:47,700
holding down the fort at stage zero, right? And I know, I can't remember his online name.

3010
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:53,700
I'm getting called out from the DDR scene. I haven't played DDR regularly in a long time.

3011
02:40:53,700 --> 02:41:01,140
Yeah, so we'll definitely make it back probably next year because next year also is I'm trying

3012
02:41:01,140 --> 02:41:06,500
to plan. I don't know if it's really going to happen, but I'm having an idea for a Japan

3013
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:10,780
tour dangled in front of me and I kind of want to do it. So it just depends on money

3014
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:16,860
and all that's good stuff. But if I do that, then no trips to the Midwest next year or

3015
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:19,980
even probably the East Coast because Japan will.

3016
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:26,180
I will be mostly doing a con report during the con or the week after and also be leaving

3017
02:41:26,180 --> 02:41:29,700
updates on Twitter about the con at Fonami.

3018
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:32,300
What you're going to have to do, you're going to have to get some more listeners while you're

3019
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:33,300
at the show.

3020
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:34,300
Hopefully.

3021
02:41:34,300 --> 02:41:43,060
I also want to talk about like last week or so, there's a new version of a version that

3022
02:41:43,060 --> 02:41:49,700
P3GameNet really plugged on the mailbag several episodes ago and it has speedrun mode after

3023
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:50,700
you beat the games.

3024
02:41:50,700 --> 02:41:51,700
Wait.

3025
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:52,700
They got me thinking.

3026
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:55,940
Sorry, which game is this?

3027
02:41:55,940 --> 02:42:03,140
A version. It's a QT platformer game where you run around like chains of walls and collect

3028
02:42:03,140 --> 02:42:04,140
gems.

3029
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:05,140
It's okay.

3030
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:09,020
Yeah, there's a new version where after you beat the games, there's a time attack mode

3031
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:13,860
and they got me thinking, more games where you, that kind of stuff. I mean, it kind of,

3032
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:18,700
I mean, it didn't mean to play the game again.

3033
02:42:18,700 --> 02:42:22,180
You know, it's kind of cool. It's kind of cool when they will patch in new modes like

3034
02:42:22,180 --> 02:42:26,140
that and new features to really extend the game's life because yeah, I mean, it gets

3035
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:30,780
people excited to kind of pop in a game they might've ignored again and go back to. Burnout

3036
02:42:30,780 --> 02:42:36,460
Paradise, excellent example of a game that's been doing this very, very well.

3037
02:42:36,460 --> 02:42:40,740
I know people that bought Burnout Paradise, sold it back, and then bought it again to

3038
02:42:40,740 --> 02:42:43,820
play the download content.

3039
02:42:43,820 --> 02:42:49,020
And on that topic, it hurts me when people say, oh, stop speedrunning the game or stop

3040
02:42:49,020 --> 02:42:55,700
playing for score. Just have fun. I mean, there are ones now telling it, impeding on

3041
02:42:55,700 --> 02:43:00,420
the fun of people like me who like to play for time or for score and there's some people

3042
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:06,780
playing for score for time is fun. So these kind of people just need to let everyone play

3043
02:43:06,780 --> 02:43:07,660
their own way.

3044
02:43:07,660 --> 02:43:11,700
It's your fucking quarter. Do what you want. Everyone else can buzz off. As long as you're

3045
02:43:11,700 --> 02:43:16,140
not breaking a machine or doing things, just do what you want. It's your quarter.

3046
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:20,300
Yeah. Last week I was in another chat room and I was talking about guitar heroes scoring

3047
02:43:20,300 --> 02:43:26,220
how the whole multiplier thing and someone was yelling the thing. No, nobody cares about

3048
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:31,700
the score. You're the guitar hero. Go play the music and I'm like, okay, but what about

3049
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:33,340
the people who do play for score?

3050
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:38,060
It's like Perfect Attack versus Freestyle and DDR. People just are into what they're

3051
02:43:38,060 --> 02:43:42,660
into. If you want to really impress me, do both at the same time. There you go. I'd get

3052
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:46,860
to see that, a Perfect Attack freestyle. That'd be pretty awesome.

3053
02:43:46,860 --> 02:43:50,940
I should maybe provide Poppin' Music freestyle.

3054
02:43:50,940 --> 02:43:55,620
Oh, God. Poppin' Music freestyle. I don't know about that one, especially because there

3055
02:43:55,620 --> 02:44:00,340
hasn't been any consumer one in a long time. I know. It was in a movie once, like a couple

3056
02:44:00,340 --> 02:44:02,020
years ago. They had some guy doing-

3057
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:03,020
Was that lost in translation?

3058
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:08,740
Yeah, yeah. It was lost in translation, but yeah, there hasn't been a lot of movement

3059
02:44:08,740 --> 02:44:11,740
in that scene in a while, but also keep in mind, there's been no Poppin' Music consumer

3060
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:16,340
style in quite a while, so it's kind of a-

3061
02:44:16,340 --> 02:44:23,900
Yeah. We haven't seen- Yeah, Poppin' is going through what I call 2DX consumer syndrome

3062
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:31,660
style. It's usually between 2DX and 6 on PS2, and then another delay between 6 and 7.

3063
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:38,420
Oh, yeah. I remember that. It could be. It could be, but if Konami were smart, they would

3064
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:42,580
just nuke all of their franchises and start them over again on PlayStation 3 or next-gen

3065
02:44:42,580 --> 02:44:46,460
hardware. PlayStation 3 would be good, because then you can import that. There you go. It'd

3066
02:44:46,460 --> 02:44:47,460
be nice.

3067
02:44:47,460 --> 02:44:52,260
I don't think it started on Poppin' last October, so it'll be nice if it could be 15 and 16

3068
02:44:52,260 --> 02:44:58,260
on PS2. Maybe have a single compilation, so that way the series will be caught up.

3069
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:02,300
We'll see. I mean, the rumor is the next 2DX on PlayStation 2 is just going to have a crap

3070
02:45:02,300 --> 02:45:06,220
load of songs, but rumors are rumors. We'll see. Anyway, JSXTO, we've got to let you go.

3071
02:45:06,220 --> 02:45:10,780
We need to go and wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call, and have fun at Fandame,

3072
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:12,420
and we expect a full report next week.

3073
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:13,900
All right. Okay. Bye.

3074
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:18,140
Take care. All right. That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight. I'm so sorry to

3075
02:45:18,140 --> 02:45:20,740
those that didn't get through. I know some of you folks wanted to call in and talk about

3076
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:25,060
other things, but it just happened. Sometimes we get slammed on the phone line, so there

3077
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:26,060
you have it.

3078
02:45:26,060 --> 02:45:29,100
We've got to get out of here, though. It's going to be a late night. We've been here

3079
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:34,220
since 6 o'clock. It's already 9-12. We still have the live-only segment in a little bit,

3080
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:37,820
and all that other stuff, so we've got to tie it all up and get out of here, but first,

3081
02:45:37,820 --> 02:45:40,500
other last-minute stories before we pull the plug on tonight's show.

3082
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:48,140
Oh, yeah. I got a ton. Anyways, so where was I? Oh, so apparently there's a rumor that

3083
02:45:48,140 --> 02:45:52,820
Battlefield Heroes is going to be headed to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Network, and

3084
02:45:52,820 --> 02:45:58,100
Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade. As you remember, I believe Battlefield Heroes is the free-to-play

3085
02:45:58,100 --> 02:46:05,980
game that they have online, a kind of a deathmatch-only flair, but apparently it's listed as coming

3086
02:46:05,980 --> 02:46:13,140
out in June 2009, according to EA's press page, and perhaps this is something they're

3087
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:22,180
going to be talking about during E3, maybe. Might be neat.

3088
02:46:22,180 --> 02:46:34,040
Also for Wii Sports Resort, there's been two more games revealed from a Japanese commercial.

3089
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:39,660
Apparently golf and table tennis will be in Wii Sports Resort. You may remember table

3090
02:46:39,660 --> 02:46:45,580
tennis was in Wii Play, and golf was in the original Wii Sports. Awesome! They're recycling

3091
02:46:45,580 --> 02:46:48,660
minigames now. Go Nintendo.

3092
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:49,660
Wow.

3093
02:46:49,660 --> 02:46:56,740
Let's see, but now it's more precise, but yet they don't have, well, they have table

3094
02:46:56,740 --> 02:47:01,900
tennis, I guess, but they don't have, well, whatever. Yes. This is interesting. Apparently

3095
02:47:01,900 --> 02:47:08,300
a new game has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii. It is mature-rated. It's called Sexy

3096
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:13,980
Poker. Yes, Sexy Poker, which the content descriptors are nudity, sexual themes, and

3097
02:47:13,980 --> 02:47:19,080
simulated gambling. Apparently the description of it is it's a strip poker game in which

3098
02:47:19,080 --> 02:47:24,020
players engage in games of blackjack and poker against female avatar opponents. The object

3099
02:47:24,020 --> 02:47:27,620
of the game is to win hands in order to remove articles of clothing from still images of

3100
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:33,360
female characters. Nurses, police, women, office workers, and sports figures can eventually

3101
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:39,040
be stripped down to show their bare breasts. Ooh, adult games on the Wii. Yeah, I remember

3102
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:42,780
strip poker games on the Commodore 64. They were epic. Yeah, but you'd think something

3103
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:49,060
like this. Pixelated boobies. They just wouldn't be, you know, coming out on the Wii, because

3104
02:47:49,060 --> 02:47:55,620
the Wii's a family system, so it's kind of surprising. There's a, this is kind of interesting,

3105
02:47:55,620 --> 02:48:02,500
Hull Breach Online, the first MMORPG for the Wii's internet channel, has now apparently

3106
02:48:02,500 --> 02:48:09,860
been scaled down to run on the DSi browser. So yes, it's a free-to-play MMO, and apparently

3107
02:48:09,860 --> 02:48:15,260
space-themed, and looks very basic, but I can imagine that you can't really do too much

3108
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:24,420
with the DSi browser. Kind of limited. And then a little bit more information about Tatsunoko

3109
02:48:24,420 --> 02:48:31,560
vs. Capcom. The game's now being called Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars, and apparently

3110
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:36,360
online play may be added in. New characters might happen, and it's supposed to be due

3111
02:48:36,360 --> 02:48:40,940
out before the end of the year. Actually, I was wondering though, because after some

3112
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:43,860
thought, the characters that you were saying were cut were never in the Japanese version

3113
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:53,300
to begin with. Yeah, well, I don't know. And then finally, it's just kind of interesting.

3114
02:48:53,300 --> 02:48:59,940
Coming from CodeJunkies.com, they have a new accessory that's out now for the Xbox 360.

3115
02:48:59,940 --> 02:49:07,080
They apparently have figured out how to reverse-engineer the memory cards. Now you can get a device

3116
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:15,300
for as cheap as $39.99, and it will use microSD cards, so you can store up to 16GB of data

3117
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:20,580
on there. And if you think about that, since it doesn't have all the backwards compatibility

3118
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:26,580
stuff, like the Xbox 360 hard drives, it's actually larger than the Xbox 360 20GB hard

3119
02:49:26,580 --> 02:49:32,860
drives, now in memory card form, so you can get these really cheap. And microSD cards,

3120
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:37,660
those are pretty damn cheap nowadays, especially the 4GB and 16GB ones. I think I just got

3121
02:49:37,660 --> 02:49:48,580
a, well it wasn't a microSD, but just a standard HD card for $50, so 16GB. So, I mean, that's

3122
02:49:48,580 --> 02:49:53,580
amazing. And now that they come up with this, I'm sure that the hacking scene is going to

3123
02:49:53,580 --> 02:49:57,020
take notice, and they're going to figure out a way to put any sort of hard drive on there.

3124
02:49:57,020 --> 02:50:02,020
Goody goody. So, matter of time. And that's it.

3125
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:05,980
Alright, well that is going to do it for another week here at Orange Launch Radio. It's time

3126
02:50:05,980 --> 02:50:11,580
to go around and wrap things up with our final thoughts. DarkSakura, whose home we've invaded

3127
02:50:11,580 --> 02:50:14,980
now with Orange Launch Radio, and it looks like we will be for the near future. Your

3128
02:50:14,980 --> 02:50:15,980
final thought tonight?

3129
02:50:15,980 --> 02:50:17,700
Let's go see Star Trek Tuesday.

3130
02:50:17,700 --> 02:50:22,660
Maybe. I don't know yet what I've got going on. But maybe. I do want to see it again.

3131
02:50:22,660 --> 02:50:24,740
Lowkey, your final thought?

3132
02:50:24,740 --> 02:50:29,060
This chair hurts my butt, and I'm going to play some Bion Commander this week.

3133
02:50:29,060 --> 02:50:34,620
Awesome. I don't really have much of a final thought, except I'm excited to be going to

3134
02:50:34,620 --> 02:50:40,060
LA in a couple weeks, and things are good. So that's it. Hopefully I get to play more

3135
02:50:40,060 --> 02:50:43,460
games this week. That's my final thought. Thank you guys so much for downloading and

3136

3138
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:55,140
