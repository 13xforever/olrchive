and I on May 31st, 2009.
The PSP Go gets confirmed a bit early, Matrix Online decides to pull the plug, and on the eve of the Expo, we go over all the eve
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.
Say hello as well to my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
How are you doing?
At least you have a voice.
My voice is leaving.
I had a busy weekend.
I should make you some coffee or some tea or something.
Coffee would be awesome, actually.
Why don't I make some coffee?
That would be super exciting.
I will do that after I announce my gaming week.
Yeah, I was going to say, we're trying to do a show right now, so maybe we'll get into that in a little bit.
I will use my Sensio.
Awesome.
Awesome.
I can't wait for hot coffee.
Fresh from Dark Sakura.
Oh.
On second thought, go get yourself.
Also say hello to Tech Master Loki who has a thread on his shirt that's bugging the hell out of me.
There it is.
Why did she do that?
Should I put it back?
No.
Okay.
I see.
That's what wives are supposed to do.
How are you, Tech Master Loki?
I'm doing fine.
Yeah?
That's what I try to do.
I've been busy Getting ready for E3?
Uh, no
No, me neither.
I am so not ready for E3, which is actually why I'm kind of excited that I don't have a lot of commitments.
You know, the great thing about you and I, and unfortunately DarkSakura can't go this year, but hopefully next year she can go again.
The great thing about us going to E3 is that we don't answer to nobody.
We only answer to you guys, the listeners, really direct what we do at E3.
And we don't answer to them either.
And sometimes we decide not to listen to them either.
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Screw responsibility!
E3 this year, I'm not feeling it as much as I have in years past.
And I know there's a lot of people that are like, you effing bastard.
I have always wanted to go to E3, and you're sitting there going, well, I'm going to E3, but I feel kind of half-assed about it this year.
From my perspective, in my defense a little bit,
DarkSakura.com
Right.
And none of my friends, you know, outside of the three of us are really going except for some of my long distance friends like Bobby and, you know, Kropotkin and some of the, you know, all games people are going to be there.
But I'm talking about, you know, some of my local friends used to be like 10 of us that would go and none of them are going.
So it's kind of weird this year.
I'm going to feel a little lonely at E3.
So if you happen to be going to E3, I might need a hug.
Because I'm feeling a little lonely this year.
Sinbad will hug you.
Yay.
And you know how we used to have the kick in Ultracade?
This is a hug-a-Rob.
So everyone go around, hug Rob, post your pictures to pics at orangejohnsradio.com And just remind me that I don't have to be alone.
Give Rob some love before he cries like an emo child.
I don't understand, Robb.
I'm in another city, I'm having fun You had lesbians to hang out with
I know, and I got to see the lesbians there.
But the lesbians aren't going to E3.
How is E3 supposed to be any fun without lesbians?
Hopefully there's some lesbians at E3 somewhere.
Every convention needs more gays.
I need a hug from lesbians at E3.
That's what I need.
Every convention is better with more gays.
Enough of my whining.
Let me introduce the chat room as well.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And look, I got a hug from Redertainment already in chat.
A nice virtual hug.
Well, thank you guys very much.
And from...
and Milma13120 as well.
So hooray for hugs.
And hooray for new people.
I see a lot of people in the chat that I have not seen before.
So I think we have some new listeners.
CyberBeast41, I think, was saying he's in Belgium and listening for the first time.
So welcome.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was pretty much The Sims, as I'm doing right now.
Awesome.
And actually, I did do some looking into Sims 3, so I'm very much looking forward to getting my hands on that.
and you know this we do have to remember you know there might be some people out there going oh my gosh The Sims but The Sims is like the best-selling PC game ever so you know we do have to remember that there is a huge audience for these games and a lot of anticipation I don't know about your neck of the woods folks but I was seeing a bunch of billboards in the Bay Area this weekend for Sims 3 they have this whole let there be Sims campaign going on so this is setting up to be a big event and it's all next week same time as E3
I'll be honest, the biggest thing that I like to do, and I quit playing it because that was all I was doing for a while, it's pretty much the thing that I like to do is make houses.
I love designing shit.
I love designing shit.
I mean, I guess maybe that's why I'm in school for it, maybe?
But the most fun for me has really been getting these bizarro little houses and putting them together.
I've been greatly enjoying it.
I can sympathize, DarkSakura, because that's why I love Quake Life.
Because I love shooting people in the face.
I love shooting people in the face, too!
That's what I'm trying to study in school, is shooting people in the face.
What a coincidence!
I had to make my own major for that.
That's actually part of a designer's job, is shooting their clients in the face when they're belligerent.
I'm sorry, I'm kidding.
That won't get me any clients.
Obviously, I'm just teasing DarkSakura.
That was a little parody there.
I was parodying your parody.
I was paradizing your parody.
I consider my parody parried.
Yeah, I'm going to get your coffee now.
Alright, yay.
Good, because I don't want you to hear about my gaming week.
Loki, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
I only played really two different things.
First being the modified version of Grand Theft Auto 4.
We're still tweaking it to get it just right, but now we have flying police cars, super ambulances, guns that shoot fire, guns that shoot explosions, guns that shoot blasts of air that launch people into the air.
So it's been a lot of fun.
I'm actually looking forward to one of the stories we're going to get into later, where they're actually going to have the expansions on their own disc, because then I can actually edit everything in Lost and Damned and the new expansions, so that'll be cool.
And then today I decided to play my copy of Fuel that I got a little early, and that's actually really fun.
And when they tell you that it has 1,800 square kilometers in the game...
Thanks for watching!
I'm talking like the most direct route I could possibly take.
Like, not on roads, just going straight towards the next outpost, over mountains, everything.
It's just insane, the size of the game.
And what's even better, though, is the fact that you don't really have to do the races, because there's actually... The currency in the game is fuel, and there's these oil barrels that you'll find that you just run into them and you get...
More fuel to buy new cars.
But it's an awesome game, and it's going to be really fun online.
So if you're a fan of racing games, especially like Motorstorm, definitely going to be a game for you.
Now, here's the burning question I have about this game Fuel, because they talk about, you know, that there's all this vast amount of land, that it's like huge, you know, all this area that you can drive, but is it interesting backdrop, drop, or is it desert bus thrilling?
I mean... No, it's very, there's a lot of variety in the terrain.
I mean, a lot of variety.
I mean, you'll get up on top of a mountain, you'll look, and you can see like mountains way in the distance, and you can actually drive there.
So it's kind of like Oblivion, but for driving.
Because that's the feel I get from Oblivion.
It's like, Oblivion is effing huge.
You will never see everything in that game unless you are a sick, sad person.
You know what I mean?
This seriously... Okay, I got tired from driving.
Like, it took me so long to get to the next destination.
I got, like, driver's syndrome or whatever, you know?
I felt tired.
In fact, that's actually when I turned the game off because I'd been playing for a few hours, but...
It's actually really fun.
There's a lot of variety.
There's a lot of events that you can do or you can just drive around.
You can make your own events and challenge people online with them.
There's a bunch of different environments, day-night cycles, different weather effects that you have.
Lots of forests.
I was driving through forests and then driving across farmland.
DarkSakura
F-Zero or Forza?
What are the controls?
and probably just like Motorstorm.
I mean, there's no nitrous in it, but it's very simple.
It's like, you know, right trigger for accelerator, left trigger for brake, and then X for handbrake.
That's it.
I'm very curious about this.
You definitely piqued my interest.
Actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com says, it's made by Codemasters and they make pretty damn awesome driving games.
Yeah, like Dirt was a really... That was Codemasters, right?
That was Codemasters, yeah.
That was a really interesting game to look at, but I couldn't control it for crap.
See, this is the other thing.
The graphics in it aren't...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
I haven't heard a lot about this game, so maybe this is going to be a sleeper hit.
It's been getting okay reviews.
I mean, it's fun.
Where are people critical of the game, and do you agree?
I haven't read the reviews yet, but I just saw the number of reviews, and they're getting mid-8s, mid-7s, low-8s.
But, I mean, it's just a number.
I've been looking forward to this game ever since they announced it, and I think it's worth it.
It's going to be very fun.
You know, the fact that they have online, you can do online free mode, so basically you're just driving with your friends.
Well, that was kind of Test Drive, wasn't it?
It was very similar to that?
Test Drive sucked.
I mean... I thought it was okay.
Okay, Test Drive was awful.
I mean, like, the landscape was very plain, and the police couldn't chase after you off the road.
It was just... I don't know.
But, um... Yeah, it's gonna be a good game.
Comes out next week.
Um...
Definitely worth picking it up.
Redertainment in our chatroom asks, Racing Tornadoes, is Helen Hunt involved in this game?
I don't know.
People have been looking for tornadoes.
I mean, I haven't found one yet.
I've just, the only kind of weather that I've driven through, maybe just because I'm only in the one section of the map.
Although, I mean, the other sections of the map are locked, but not necessarily.
I mean, you can drive to them and stuff, but none of the events appear until you've unlocked so many races and stuff.
But, I mean, free mode, you can drive across the whole thing.
And I would be willing to bet it'd take a few hours to get from one side of the map to the other.
I mean, it's huge.
Wow.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My game of the week has been interesting.
I haven't had a lot of time to play games because I've been out of town this week, but I decided to try something different this week.
If you were listening to the show last week, you heard that I've been kind of disillusioned with a lot of stuff that's been going on in Warcraft lately.
I think I've just kind of hit my saturation point with the game itself.
I just need a break.
The expansion, even though they have the new dungeon, the old war and all that stuff, I'm just not feeling it.
I needed a break from WoW.
So I got a great idea for something I could do actually as an article for OrangeLawnTrader.com and what I'm doing is an article about what I have missed in two and a half years in Final Fantasy XI and I reactivated my account this week on Final Fantasy XI.
Oh my god!
I had to come right back in the room to hear Rob say something that I was dreading.
Now, something you should know, I have not told anybody this.
Not a single... No.
One person I told this because of another conversation we were having.
One person.
New.
Until now.
Now, like, what?
However many people are listening, no.
So it's kind of something I was keeping a little bit under wraps because it was something, you know, I wanted to kind of see...
what's what I've been missing and what I could pick up on I'll tell you what damn there is a lot that has changed it was really hard for me to kind of get back into it but I will say this one thing I've noticed and I'll write a full because I'm not I'm nowhere near ready enough to write something full for the website yet and believe me there will be a long article coming on the website later I will notice this one of the first things I noticed right away they have made it way easier to solo in that game like there is so much more you can do in the first like 15 levels than you could before me to go back and play
I am honestly going to say, if you quit this game because grouping was too much for you, there might be more in this game for you now.
Well, that was the big thing, is I hated being the party bitch.
With the addition of the field manuals and this stuff, where you can kind of get experience for WoW-style questing, and the fact that now easy prey monsters are a lot easier to kill and give you like 60 experience, whereas before they would give you like 15 experience.
Thank you for watching!
It's going to be interesting to see what happens.
I don't know how long I'm going to stick with it.
I don't know.
You know, a big reason I stuck with WoW as long as I did is the people.
And in Final Fantasy XI right now, there is no people.
I know one person that's playing and I have yet to run into them in the game.
So I don't know.
I don't know how it's gonna go, but I wanted to really see because part of the reason I did this is because I have been so critical of Final Fantasy XI on the show and I've kind of joked with listeners that I do feel I owe it to give the educated opinion if I'm gonna knock on the game to see what I've missed in two and a half years because every single person I talk to
that still plays the game says, Rob, it has changed.
Level syncing revolutionized the game.
You need to go back.
So, I went back.
So we'll see what happens.
So I'm giving it a month.
If I like it, I'll stay.
If I don't, I'll go back to WoW because I'll probably miss it in about a month's time.
But honestly, with E3 this week and everything else, I don't expect to see the story on OrangeLondrina.com for about two weeks.
Because this next week, I'm not going to be... So it won't be for like two weeks.
In case of irony, I'm actually going to...
Sony Online.
They're going to give me a walkthrough of all their MMOs, which is great because I don't have time to play any of them.
But man, I want to check out APB when that's there.
That's going to be there.
I hope Star Trek Online makes an appearance.
We'll see.
To quote GS68 in the chat room, it says, an e-drinking game rule, every time Sky talks about MMOs, chug until he stops talking about them.
And I told him not to do that because I'd die of liver failure.
I know, it seems like all I ever talk about is MMOs.
Well, I needed something, you know, just Warcraft just kind of, you know, I needed a break.
Which is sad because I had a break not that long ago, but, you know, it is what it is.
If games aren't fun, I don't play them.
So I decided to try to have fun somewhere else.
So we'll see.
Anyhow, more to come on that in future weeks.
That was pretty much it for my game of the week.
I played some Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but it's all stuff I've talked about before.
I'm sure you all were going to get a kick out of that one anyway.
Oh, and the show wasn't uploaded because his drive failed.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But at least I hope, I didn't check But I don't think there would be a reason I'm pretty sure we always would copy them over So we should be caught up on the podcast sometime this week It's going to be very tough with E3 and everything going on But I want to get at least last week's show up Like tomorrow before I leave We'll slowly get caught up But that's the reason why the podcast feed is behind And we are really, really sorry But these things happen Technical difficulties I wasn't here last week because I was laying floor
Which I just finished today.
It took forever.
But it looks nice.
Ranma in chat says, Sky, it's not lost.
I can tell you how to retrieve it.
Don't worry, we have a backup copy here on this computer.
It's not going to need anything fancier or what have you.
Especially if somebody's been bootlegging the show now, which I heard has been happening, just in case of future loss.
We're fine.
We should have everything on this computer.
Stay tuned to our Twitter for more updates.
And by the way, if you're not on the Twitter for OLR,
Please get on there.
Twitter.com slash OLR because I'm telling you what, the Twitter users are going to be controlling E3 for Orange Lounge Radio.
We are going to be tweeting from the show floor.
What do you want us to look at?
What do you want pictures of?
What do you want us to ask?
What games are you not hearing enough about on the main sites?
Because you know everybody's going to be talking about PSP Go and whatever Microsoft says and if Nintendo throws out a new Mario game, they're going to be talking about that and that there's going to be so many games that are overlooked.
That's what we're focusing on at E3 this year.
The stuff that everyone else...
You have to find the Korean porn games.
We will be looking for the Korean porn games.
You betcha.
I hope they're there.
I hope the loss of Kensha Hall did not make us lose the porn games.
I love Kensha Hall.
I know.
I'm very sad to see it's gone.
But it looks like they have a lot of those developers in West Hall on the side.
So we'll see.
I'm thinking they just did some clever rearranging of things.
And there are a few people that aren't there this year.
We don't have Atari this year, which, by the way, Loki reminded me.
There won't be Star Trek online because Atari's not there.
But, you know, there's some other companies that aren't there.
You're normally in the closet anyways over there.
Remember last time?
Oh, Atari, you're only one of the big innovators.
Stupid douchebag.
Who was that douchebag with the skateboard with carpet on it?
With the PSP inside the skateboard?
Nah.
Oh, God.
Yeah, I remember that guy.
Anyway, I will be at the show Tuesday, Wednesday.
Loki will be at the show Wednesday, Thursday.
So between the two of us, we'll have the show covered all three days.
At least I think I am going to a party Wednesday night.
I'm hearing all these people talk about, oh, I got invited to seven parties and all this stuff.
I think we're going to a party Wednesday night for Games for Windows.
And thank you very much for passing along the invite for that.
We're going to check it out, see what that's all about.
PC games.
I know that's something DarkSakura's into, obviously.
So I think for her, we need to check out what Games for Windows is all about and see what they're going to be announcing there.
Find out what doesn't suck.
Definitely.
Alright, speaking of what doesn't suck, we got so much news this week to get to.
We're already 20 minutes into the show and then some.
Let's get into the gaming news this week.
Loki, start us off.
Yes.
So, the rumor is that the PlayStation Slim or PlayStation 3 Slimmer model, whatever they're going to call it, is supposed to be coming out August or September according to the Ars Technica Mole.
Now,
Why should we believe this?
Well, because they were the one that talked about PSP Go.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What's interesting though, there's a lot of people that say the PS3 Slim is still BS.
And I was listening to Bobby, who's on right before us on All Games Radio, and he was talking about how his hardware expert folks that help him do Friday Night Gaming don't think that it could fit.
That there's so much that goes with Blu-ray that you can't slim it down that much more.
Now my thought is maybe there's a technology we're unaware of yet, I don't know.
I think that it's going to happen.
I mean, we're going to find out about it tomorrow.
Or, not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.
Well, I don't think we're actually going to find out about it tomorrow.
I think there's a good argument being made that they want to keep this thing under wraps.
Notice how this got ceased and desisted.
Whereas nothing else that's been leaked from Sony, including things we're going to get into later and so on, that a lot of you probably heard about, have not been ceased and desisted.
But there's a reason for that.
The reason why... Because it's all going to be revealed Wednesday anyway.
It's all about hype, right?
This was probably going to be a big surprise or something, but the other PSP Go stuff, that's already been released by Sony.
I mean, it's...
If the PS3 comes out, or they come out Wednesday and say the PlayStation 3 is going to be getting a slim model in a few months, sales of the PlayStation 3 will stop.
It will come to a standstill because everybody's going to be waiting for this new system.
No, it won't.
And you know why?
It's because of the same reason why there's a new SKU of the PlayStation 3 every time.
They don't stop sales.
And if anything, what they'll do is a price drop on the current system.
They'll drop it down.
to clear out inventory, and then you'll have the new system coming out at this normal price.
They've done the same pattern every time.
It was $4.99, or before it was $5.99, $4.99, and then they would drop the system that was $5.99 down to $4.99 and clear it out, and then the new system would come out at $5.99.
Well, now that they've dropped it to $100 again, it's $4.99, $3.99, same type of thing's going to happen.
These are going to drop down to maybe $50.00,
and they're going to clear them out or they may even just keep offering it on the side and just have this one SKU or whatever later on towards the holidays but they're just going to drop the price of it a little bit until the systems clear out and then they're going to have the new one.
All right, well, we'll see.
I mean, there's a lot to be seen out of the press conference, and I think this is one of the will-they-or-won't-they items.
But one interesting thing, I don't know if it's going to be covered tomorrow at the whole press conference, but apparently Africa is finally getting some type of U.S.
release.
That's right.
Apparently Africa is finally going to be coming to the U.S., but they changed the spelling back.
It's actually going to be Africa with a C now.
It's not going to be with a K. Apparently it was a big part of it.
How could they do that to us?
It's not Africa.
It's Africa.
Oh, sorry.
Africa.
But apparently with less K and more C. I don't know.
Was it offensive or something?
I don't know why, but yeah.
They are deciding to change the name back to Africa with a C. But it is finally coming out for the PlayStation 3, so if you were importing it, you don't really have to do that anymore.
Can we hunt animals?
No.
Dang it.
I am not buying this at all.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Real quick before we get to the next story.
TigerClaw says, that's a damn shame.
I kind of like the other title, Hakuna Matata.
Well, it is kind of a cute title, but I bet Disney would glare if that happened here in the U.S.
That game actually came out with release.
I mean, it's not like they own the rights to that phrase, but, you know, come on.
Whenever you hear Hakuna Matata, you can't help but think of Hakuna Matata.
Well, now they're going to try to trademark the word up, so, you know.
They've already got one of the directions.
I mean, why not?
Hopefully they don't trademark Orange Lounge Radio or we're going to be in trouble.
I don't know.
We'll see.
We need to hurry up and actually get some sort of trademark.
Patent pending.
Yeah, patent pending.
Actually, did you know, if you search the internet, obviously there's the banned act that we do take our namesake from in Japan, although that's a Japanese artist, not an American artist.
Um...
There's some place, like some building or something, there's actually a music thing called the Orange Lounge, where I guess they have these musical acts come perform.
I think it's in Southern California, too.
I think it's some type of gallery or whatever.
I found it when doing a search one night, you know, randomly, just like, ooh, what else is named Orange Lounge out there?
How big are we on the internet?
Well, it's interesting because you would think they would have...
Really not like the fact that there's an Orange Lounge radio out there because we're both music oriented in a way.
But here's the catch.
We've been around since 2001.
They haven't.
So if they did say anything, we'd be able to say, we were first.
You change your name.
No, you.
But, I mean, you know.
Oh, you.
It would be interesting to see what happens.
Anyhow, enough of that.
Let's move on with the gaming news.
Well, we have some very interesting stuff.
And actually, it's a confirmation for something that...
Loki brought up is that Sony did accidentally let stuff out on the PSP Go, which, you know what, honestly, I think sometimes this accidental stuff is half on purpose.
Accidental my ass.
They throw it out enough for it to catch on and then say, oh no, cease and desist, get this crap off of here.
You know, just tease, tease, tease, tease, tease.
It's enough for the fanboys to get aroused by it, but not enough for the big sites, the AP, CNN, and all these to report on it just yet.
It's bait.
Exactly.
It's bait because it's basically generating buzz for this now so that you want to hear what's going to happen at the press conference and you all tune in to that to find out their other announcements.
It's bait is what it is.
Tell us a little more about it, DarkSakura.
Well, on Sony's core gaming show that they do, they posted the episode and then pulled it because they had talked about the PSP Go on there.
It has 16 gigabyte flash memory and Bluetooth support for mobile phone tethering.
That's pretty cool.
and also it mentioned Gran Turismo, LittleBigPlanet, Jak and Daxter and Metal Gear Games.
So there actually are some photos of it out and about and I'm trying to pull those up right now.
Well, that's very interesting.
I didn't catch the part about the mobile phone tethering, but isn't that interesting because we've heard reports that the new Apple firmware is supposed to support the whole tethering thing.
You're going to have to pay more money, but I wonder.
It's a very interesting time kind of thing.
I think the Bluetooth is there for the mobile phone tethering.
Yeah, just looking at this.
I think it's just.
DarkSakura.com
GoCondom
and you have a PS button and a Bluetooth light and some shoulder buttons of course are on the top.
But I don't know, it looks kind of cheap to me.
Interesting comment from SonOfDad in chat.
I like this observation.
If you notice John Collar say that with some games be announced at E3, they knew it was going to be leaked before E3.
So maybe the phrasing that they used in some of the interviews, they knew this was going to be leaked before E3 actually happened.
Oh, no doubt.
No doubt about it.
I mean, this is Sony.
And please excuse my voice tonight.
I don't know if I said it earlier in the show, but I've thrown out my voice this weekend with some of the other stuff I had going on.
Rob's changed his throat now.
He sounds like a 12-year-old boy.
I know.
If I crack while reading some of your chat comments, it's not puberty, okay?
It's just I've really hurt my voice this weekend.
But here's what really happened.
What?
Nothing.
Oh, I get it.
You were making a joke.
All right.
Anyhow.
Loki, make yourself useful.
Read some gaming news.
Alright, so more information from the quote-unquote leaked issue of Core.
They also had some different games that were being announced in there as well, including Gran Turismo PSP.
Right, Gran Turismo PSP being announced for the, or being announced.
Wasn't that supposed to have come out like years ago?
Yeah, I was like, wasn't Gran Turismo for the PSP announced like in 2005?
Exactly.
A new Jak and Daxter game for the PSP, well that's a surprise.
And also a new Metal Gear Solid game for the PSP.
which is interesting.
They also had other clips including footage from LittleBigPlanet which that looks awesome.
And some other stuff.
Possibility of Warhawk as well.
I don't know.
But I'm sure we're going to get a lot of PSP buzz coming from the press conference at E3.
To shut up those people that says that they really haven't released anything on the PSP in the past year which would be somewhat true.
You know what I mean?
A Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP?
That's huge.
And it's not, you know, the portable ops.
It's not acid.
It's freaking solid.
Solid.
It's a solid game.
Now, one thing that didn't make our show roll tonight is about the Kojima countdowns that have been going on.
Because, you know, stories about countdowns are getting a little old here on Horizons Radio.
But, I mean, if this is what it is building up towards... I think it's building up to multiple things, actually.
I think that the countdown's building up to three different announcements.
One being a Raiden Metal Gear Solid game, which is probably going to be for the PS3.
The other being this probably Metal Gear Solid game based off of kind of the timeline of Metal Gear Solid 3, you know, with Big Boss.
And also, I think, that game Mask, which looks like a survivor horror game that he was supposed to be working on, a survivor horror game.
Another survival horror from Konami?
I mean, that would be their third.
That's big.
Behind Silent Hill, Saw, and now this?
Really?
Yeah.
Interesting.
Well, it was supposed to be a zombie, like, you know, Left 4 Dead type of game, but still Survivor Horror.
Oh, so like maybe more action-y than what we're used to.
I don't know, but it's a creepy picture that they have, so.
DarkTetsuya seems to agree with you, says in chat, you know, Loki's probably right.
You might want to be careful when you say things like that.
Don't let it get to his head.
All right, I'm curious, chat room, what do you guys think?
Do you think Loki's right?
Do you think it means three different games could possibly be on their way?
Or this could be the E3 of nothing but Metal Gear, which would kind of make sense a little bit because we haven't heard a lot coming out of Konami's camp.
We'll have more later on, and I'm sure they're going to be showcasing the Saw game and some of their music games.
But what else?
They've also got that other... There wasn't a lot that came out of their Gamers Day.
Well, there was that one that looked like Castlevania, but it wasn't Castlevania, which I don't remember the hell that game was called.
But we were supposed to be talking about it last week.
And then there was also... You know, their music games saw Silent Hill, the new one that's Shattered Memories or whatever that was.
Oh, yeah, the Wii one.
Silent Hill.
Which actually looks really cool.
It's apparently different each time you play it, depending on how you answer their personality profile thing.
It's like the eHarmony of Survivor Horror.
Oh, hooray.
You better hurry up and trademark that.
I hope it doesn't reject me for being a fag, just like eHarmony would.
I'll just put a gay bar where the bar normally goes.
No, and then they have some other game.
It's like tornadoes.
It'll make all the zombies just want to dance.
That's horrible.
Prop 8 will attack you instead of...
Prop 8 will kick me in the face.
That's what I'll get.
There's way too much gay going on the show right now.
They've got stuff that haven't been announced yet.
Tornado Outbreak was the other game, which is coming out in September.
Don't know what the hell it is, but it's a game from Konami.
It has tornadoes in it.
It's like tornadoes.
Sony doesn't just make PlayStations and PSPs.
You'll actually be able to use Remote Play to access your PlayStation 3.
And here's the thing, the device has 3G on it, so here's the deal.
When you get on this, you can use the 3G to stream movies, images, music from your PlayStation 3 hard drive.
Isn't that kind of neat?
Yeah, so if you have porn saved on your drive, you could have that anywhere, streaming over 3G.
What a waste of our bandwidth.
Porn anywhere?
Wow, that sounds like the internet.
Oh, wait, it is the internet.
Well, here's the other deal.
In Europe, you can get Play TV.
You'll be able to view, rewind, pause, whatever live television.
And you can also record it while you're on the go, the way the mobile phone is.
That's technology we've never seen before.
So if you forget, like, oh crap, I was supposed to record Grey's Anatomy or whatever, you can set it from your phone, I guess.
Keep in mind, though, for the most part, cell phones in Japan have been just decades ahead of what we've had here for the longest time until we started trickling out with trios and BlackBerrys and finally the iPhone.
And now we have all these apps for iPhones that will do all this crap for us.
But still, I mean...
This is probably really nothing major.
This is expected probably.
Yeah, I don't think the Sony I know has a shaking baby application.
That's something that's missing.
The iPhone does not have it anymore.
Not anymore?
They don't have the cocaine application anymore either.
There was a cocaine application?
You could sort the thing and then... It's a hell of a drug.
We actually talked about it in my typography class.
Wow.
How is that relevant to typography?
Do you make letters out of the coke?
I know a lot of... Were some of the best fonts designed?
Never mind.
Some of the best fonts were designed by lots of people who were on lots of stuff.
Alright.
Let's see.
Ranma says, so grab your dick and double click for porn, porn, porn.
GameGuru says, why would I TiVo Grey's Anatomy?
I don't know.
Obviously someone is.
The show's still on.
Exactly.
You'd have to watch it live.
Misty says, no, the internet is for OLR, which is the gateway to porn.
Get it right, GameGuru.
Oh, sorry.
Dark Shy says 3G coverage isn't exactly everywhere, is it?
I saw a map of 3G coverage for the newest iPhone.
I don't think it's everywhere, but for the big city people, like I don't know where you live, but I can tell you living here in Sacramento and the places I go the most are San Francisco, LA, you know, the places I drive.
I don't ever lose 3G unless I'm in like the basement of a building or behind, you know, solid walls where the signal can't reach and I'll go on edge.
Like I get 3G everywhere.
Well, I, and to be perfectly honest, you don't even need 3G, really, to get good signal in a major city.
Yeah.
To be perfectly honest, I've never wanted it.
I mean, I know I've heard a lot of complaints about AT&T and their coverage, but it's been fine for me.
Very, very rare do I not have 3G.
So, I don't know, maybe I'm just lucky.
Now they have 4G.
Yeah, I know.
Freaking Apple.
Did you hear about this rumor about the dormant video thing that's been in everybody's phone the whole time that they're finally going to turn on with iPhone 3.0?
Boy, oh boy.
You mean the thing that there's been homebrew apps that have already been doing it?
Yeah, that.
DarkSakura
Well, something that I've been particularly looking forward to and I'm glad finally has somewhat of a date is Star Trek Online.
Because I want my own ship, damn it.
And I would like to throw Tribbles at DarkSakura.
As long as you don't feed them.
Remember, if you feed them, then they breed.
I have, by the way, had the most Tribble-tastic week because I think I've watched Trials and Tribblations like four times this last week.
Nerd.
And Trouble with Tribbles once.
and then we tried to watch the animated episode and then the people watching it with me complained about the bad animation quality I swear I didn't mean to derail your story
anyway, according to one of Atari's financial documents it says that they expect Star Trek Online to be out no later than March 31st, 2010 and it will be both console and PC, according to the document nothing official from Cryptic yet but I'm sure that we should see something soon
I want to play I know, talk about the game that will make me leave any MMO I'm playing wherever my fickle ass is at the moment World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI, Hell Ragnarok I don't know, maybe I'll get into EVE before this is all over I'm going to Star Trek Online the minute this comes out I need to make the Oelarians I will be putting official data out for what these specs are to make an Oelarian and I want nothing but, I want to captain my own ship of nothing but redshirt people
You can't because you have to have command people.
Damn it!
You have to have doctors.
So if you think the MMO talk is bad now, just wait until this game comes out.
Wait to see how nerdy we all get.
Again, and I say this every time, and I'm going to say it every time, every week, every time this game gets brought up, I'm going to say this.
This game better not suck.
Star Trek has so much momentum going for it right now.
Please.
There will be riots in the streets.
It will be me.
It'll just be Rob.
He'll be out there going, riot!
And maybe DarkSakura.
I will throw a Slurpee against a window of a 7-Eleven.
That'll be my riot.
I will be pissed if this game sucks.
And we'll put it on YouTube or something.
You know, as the classic line from the movie goes, better to be pissed off than pissed on.
Ranma says, Sky will request a pink starship with sparkles.
No.
No.
You're freaking like stereotyping or something?
No, I do not want a pink starship with sparkles.
I want a purple starship with sparkles, ass.
And Stick Axe asks, what if the game sucks, Rob?
Well, you heard me.
Riot.
Then we take to the streets.
Then we protest in front of Atari.
We get all the people at Cryptic and we It'll be a dual protest.
One side of the sign will say overturn Prop 8 and the other side will say remake Star Trek because this version sucks.
And then we subject the people at Cryptic that are in charge of that to investigation by special means.
Alright.
By probing.
That's right.
There you go.
There's the answer.
If this game sucks, anal probes.
Exactly.
All right.
And I'll tell you what, just for that, I'm putting a model of the Enterprise in my home.
Let's probe around the world right now and look at the upcoming release dates for upcoming games.
Hey listen, I'm sorry every time you say that the Metallica song pops into my head.
Give me fuel, give me fire, give me that which I desire I like how you said that, it's kind of eh
Okay, but other things coming out.
Age of Pirates 2, City of Abandon on PC.
Arr, it's abandoned.
Crazy Chicken Atlantis Quest on DS Fuck these games, weren't there like three of them last week?
Crazy Chicken Star Carts on DS These are probably the same games from last week, they just never came out Gee, I wonder why Crazy Chicken Pharaoh's Treasure on DS Yes, Mumbo Jumbo doesn't know anything about hitting dates as far as releases go
Red Faction Guerrilla coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3.
That game looks awesome.
The main feature, I guess, was explosions.
Can't go wrong there.
It's on Mars.
If any of these Crazy Chicken games are actually good games, I will eat a cup of mayonnaise.
And anyone who knows me...
and DarkSakura.
Oh, well, even better.
No disrespect to whatever they like over there in the UK, but then you're basically just telling me, oh, on top of already thinking these games are going to suck, you're telling me they're licensed games off of TV and movie properties.
How often are those games any good?
They're not.
Night's in the Nightmare on DS, coming from Atlus.
And then, of course, one of the bigger titles of the week, Sims 3, coming out on PC, also available in a collector's edition, where you get a bunch of useless crap.
And then the game with the longest title of the week, and I don't know why, but Johnny Bravo and the Huckamega Mighty Ultra Extreme Datorama.
Yes, the title may be long, but the game still sucks.
and then of course we've got some other fun stuff more party games from Majesco go play Lumberjacks with Lumberjack themed games and go play Circus Star where you can play as a circus performer is it a Lumberjack and it's okay?
and then Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad coming to the DS from Destineer and finally a week from today the legendary Starfy a game that apparently is a franchise in Japan I don't know anything about it and it looks stupid but that's just my dumb American opinion
Questions from chat.
Marissa is in chat.
Hi, Marissa.
Marissa Congusto asks, No, Rob, not Mayo.
Don't do it.
You know what?
I'm that confident that I'm right, so I'm not even worried about it.
It's just like Loki doing the bet on Eye of Judgment, the legendary bet that people still haven't shut up about two years later.
He was that confident in it, and you know what?
He was right.
Stick Axe asks, how would we determine whether they're any good, Rob?
Would it be that the games have a Metacritic score above a certain amount?
I suppose, but honestly, you've been listening to this show long enough.
You can trust me.
If the games are good, I will tell you.
And we will do it.
And if you don't believe me, you think I'm lying, we can agree upon a non-discriminatory panel or something.
I don't know.
But I'm that confident these games are no good.
Come on.
Games like this are a dime a dozen.
Do you really think there's a chance in hell I'm eating the mayonnaise?
Hell no, otherwise I wouldn't have said it.
Are you looking it up on Metacritic right now?
Okay, this has got to go then on the official stuff, ongoing bets on the show.
You know, I think this game is so awesome, it's not even on there.
Oh, wait, here we go.
Here's the last one that came out on DS.
Chicken Hunter, which is also the same franchise, they just changed the name, got a Metacritic rating of 39.
That's quality right there.
There you go, exactly.
I have nothing to worry about.
You could probably go off Metacritic and I'd be just fine.
Hey, let's talk about something interesting, and that is the Japanese release date.
Although I do like Marissa's idea of making it Bacon-A's to make it a little easier on me.
Bacon-A's is great.
So if I do... I do want to put that clause in the contract, just in case.
The cup of mayonnaise do be Bacon A's, and I think everybody would agree, just for my own sanity and well-being, that would be the way to do it.
Thank you.
I will end up in the hospital again with pancreatitis if I lose this bet.
Just wait.
Anyway... That's why we'll get you some fat-free mayonnaise.
Yeah.
Fat-free Bacon A's?
Good luck.
They're gonna have to, like, invent it.
Alright, on the Xbox 360, I'm gonna have to fucking eat...
Miracle Whip on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
Nothing.
It is completely empty until June 25th.
There is like nothing on the calendar right now for the Xbox 360.
It's pretty boring right now over in Japan.
Just not a busy time of year for them.
PlayStation 3 really doesn't look much different, I have to be honest.
It's a very slow week over there.
Moving on, however, to the Nintendo Wii.
At least you get Ark Rise Fantasia comes out in Japan from Marvelous.
That comes out on the Wii this week.
That's really the only release to look forward to there.
And taking a look at the PlayStation 2, Evangelion Joe comes out there.
What?
More Eva games?
Of course, of course.
There's just no other...
No other way to do it over there.
And on the Nintendo DS, you have a few more options.
You have Kotowari Sahai Simulation, Ochanoma Pro Yaku DS is the name of that game.
I'm not sure what exactly you're simulating.
Oh, it looks like baseball.
It looks like a baseball coach game.
So there you go.
Looking really quick on the PSP to see if there's anything of interest there, although I highly doubt it.
Oh, you get a port of that same Evangelion game on the PSP.
And that's really it.
Kids like Ava.
That's right.
That's really it for Japanese releases.
Kind of a slow week for them.
Well, how about we go overseas in another direction?
Here's stuff that is coming out in UK.
We have on the 5th actually a bunch of releases.
At least a handful anyway.
New Play Control Donkey Kong Jungle Beat on Wii.
Red Faction Guerrilla on Xbox 360 and PS3.
Sacred 2 Fallen Angel on Xbox 360 and PS3.
Star Ocean The Last Hope on Xbox 360.
Walk With Me Do You Know Your Walking Routine on DS.
No, I forgot how to walk.
It's your walking routine.
Left, right, left, right, left, right.
So do I get to make a walking dance routine or something?
It's scheduling your walks, I guess.
I guess.
And then Sims 3, of course, which, yay!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
All right.
You've built this live on air.
You started from scratch at the beginning of the night?
No, I didn't start on... I actually started it last night.
Oh, I thought you did the whole thing on air tonight.
Here's my entire house.
See, there's my potty.
Oh.
And there's the upstairs.
All right, anyhow.
This is horrible radio.
They can't see it.
I'll put pictures up eventually.
All right.
Let's move on with some more gaming news.
We will get into the classic game of the week and our break tonight pretty soon.
We still have about ten more stories to go over, so, Loki, we better get to it.
Ha ha.
Sorry, I'm looking at a picture.
It's funny.
DJ Hero, a game that we've been talking about for quite a while now.
Lots of stuff coming out this week.
Especially game trailers ran.
An exclusive E3 trailer that they put out.
Showing some of the gameplay.
Which is not surprising, you know, it looks very much how they described it in the magazine.
But we've got some more details now.
They're going to have a few different versus modes, including DJ versus DJ, DJ plus DJ, you know, like a co-op, or DJ plus guitar, you know, for the 10 tracks that they have, you know, guitar support for.
And, of course, you know, the game's going to be coming out on all platforms, rumored to be $120.
That's kind of expensive, and...
Also, they're going to be having a limited edition pack coming out that's going to be tying in with Jay-Z and Eminem.
Apparently, it's going to come with an advanced version of the controller, a DJ stand, a metal traveling case, and also the greatest hit CDs from both rappers.
And sadly enough, I want to get that.
Not because I'm fans of them, but because I like the idea of, you know...
a DJ stand and a metal traveling case that would be all sorts of nerdy cool this is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3 I want to see how they're pulling this off because I love the concept I was a little nervous when I first heard they were making this game but everything I'm hearing I love the idea of the songs all being mashups everything sounds good but it's all in the execution this is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3 same here
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, our chat room is lighting up right now with comparisons.
Of course, whenever it seems like the DJ games get brought up, 2DX gets brought up.
Interesting enough, the next story I have has to do with Bomani and what could possibly be next in the U.S.
It's about another music series, not Beatmania, but Poppin' Music.
Now, you might remember we all declared Poppin' Music dead in the U.S.
when Beat and Groovy crashed and burned.
Remember that one on Xbox Live Marketplace?
Oh, my God.
Damn it, Rob.
I've been trying
I'm trying to forget about that.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
The 9 configuration without having to release a new controller.
No idea.
This could be very interesting.
They're not going to put in freestyle mode or anything, are they?
No idea.
Some people are saying maybe it's like a pop and music adventure kind of game.
I don't know.
Which is, I guess, a spin-off series that happened in Japan.
I'm not as familiar with it.
Despite all the bumani I do know about, I'm not as familiar with the adventure series.
But apparently the game is coming out August 6th.
So if there is an American version of this coming out, which the trademark would lead you to believe, we might see it at E3.
That would be very interesting.
That's just bizarre.
Yeah, very bizarre.
Who knows?
More to come on this probably this next week.
We'll see.
Well, I do have sad news for the five people still playing Matrix Online.
All five of you.
I'm counting you.
Well, you're SOL now.
It's actually...
You know what?
I picked the wrong thing.
Oh, that's... No, yeah, I did.
Sorry.
I did pick the right thing.
Oops!
Live radio.
These things happen sometimes.
Why don't you start it from the top?
Well, for the five people who are still playing this, sorry guys.
Sony hates you.
They really do hate you.
Actually, Sony of Europe is pulling Matrix Online.
It is being shut down.
I'm sorry, why did I say Sony of Europe?
Sony Online Entertainment will be closing it down on July 31st.
You better get in your Matrix-ing while you can.
and then prepare to swallow your blue pill.
Before somebody unplugs you.
You're done.
No more.
Wait for private servers to pop up.
I'm not surprised.
Me neither.
I really didn't realize.
I actually thought it ended a long time ago.
Didn't they do the end of the world event or something in there?
That was a beta.
Oh, I thought the damn thing was done a long time ago.
I thought so too, but I think that was just the beta.
Yeah.
Actually, it was Ben Chamberlain, who was the designer and GM, was the one doing all the content updates, the one keeping everything alive, and then he left.
So, basically, they're going to be doing some sort of monumental end of the world thing, and then that's it.
The exact same thing they did for the beta.
I'm kind of curious here.
Gold Anthro is in chat and apparently is somewhat of a fan of the Matrix Online.
Says, I was following the story of that.
They could at least finish the story properly.
Maybe make a second Animatrix collection based on the events of the MMO.
But Jamie, a lot of fun of that game is the story.
That's why I followed it and tried the free trial.
So, another opinion from chat.orangeentree.com.
I mean, for hardcore fans of The Matrix, to be fair, as much as we're teasing the game because the game itself didn't look to be a lot of fun, at least when I saw Loki playing it a long time ago, it was, for fans of The Matrix, they were continually building in that universe.
They were continuing the story.
Didn't they kill off one of the major characters from the movie, like, in the game or something?
Yeah.
I don't remember.
I'm just kind of asking that out loud.
I'm sure I'd get a response from Jack.
Really?
I didn't keep up with it enough to notice.
Thank you.
Morpheus apparently allegedly died.
I thought one of the main characters there.
Well, who misses him?
Chat.HornslawnTrader.com Well, if you're a fan of the Matrix series, then you might.
Alright, well, we'll see if any pirate servers pop up or what game these fans plan to go to, if anything.
And as the Matrix Online dies, another thing comes back from the dead.
EGM actually is back now, to the praise of many of its fans.
Apparently EGM was sold to its original founder, and he's planning on starting a publication in print and as well as online.
and no word yet if any of the staff members that were fired back when UGO bought up the 1UP brand, if they're going to somehow bring those people back.
Maybe some people will return back.
I'm sure if they're asked.
But they have an exciting plan for taking this magazine to the next evolution, they say.
It's interesting, though, because that was actually a pretty good magazine.
With it gone, it's pretty much just...
Game Informer, which isn't bad.
You know, is there a lot, now an interesting question is playing devil's advocate here, especially in this economy, in this world we live in, with the internet and everything, is there a demand for print publication?
I think, well, I mean, like, Game Informer's pretty good.
You know, I'd
I wouldn't probably voluntarily sign up for it unless I get the discount cards through GameStop and that's really the only incentive.
But they've had a lot of exclusive stories lately and probably because they're GameStop and can afford to say, hey, give us the exclusive story on this or we won't buy as much.
That type of stuff.
So...
which has to violate some type of antitrust law just by the way or it could be the other way around it could be that they're giving them that because they're like hey look at our user base for this magazine is huge and yeah it is huge because you get it when you sign up for this card that basically pays for itself pretty quick I don't know it's not bad but still I think there is room for more gaming publications out there I mean hell EGM hasn't even gone that long
Rob, you're such a goof.
So there you go.
EGM, coming soon to a bathroom near you.
Hey, hopefully not going to end up in your bathroom but in your console.
Squeenix!
has a brand new... Believe it or not, it's not Final Fantasy XIV.
It's not Kingdom Hearts XI.
It is a brand new franchise.
It's something called N.I.E.R.
Nier.
Although that might be a little bit deceptive because I guess it's like a new type of front mission game.
No, no.
There's two different games.
Okay, so N.I.E.R.
Nier is one of the... It's a hack and slash action game.
It looks fucking awesome.
Really?
I didn't look at the videos of this yet.
What's it kind of look like?
Um...
I don't know.
It's really like...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Oh, that's tough.
By the way, just kind of on a side note, this is a Final Fantasy and the PSP bundle that will be coming with it August 25th.
Yeah, new Front Mission game that's coming out is going to be a little bit different because you remember Front Mission is more of a tactical strategy game, whereas this one's going to be like Armored Core.
It's just, you know, get mech, kill things, which I can get behind that.
Shadow Next Gen in chat says, I want Kingdom Hearts 3, damn it.
You know what?
Me too.
I know they have these spin-off games coming this year, and sadly, I think that's all we're going to get is the DS and PSP Kingdom Hearts games.
I think the ones that are coming out in Japan are going to come here too, inevitably.
But you know what?
Disney has a huge booth at E3 this year, and granted, I know they have all their little Hannah Montana and whatever type games that they do, which is probably in reality all you're going to see there.
There's a part of me that just really hopes maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 is a surprise announcement.
At least something.
Throw me a freaking bone here.
Show me a new teaser trailer.
Give me something to look forward to in 2010 after Final Fantasy XIII is out.
I would hope if nothing else, if they do the whole Square Theater or whatever again, that we see a little bit of a tease of Kingdom Hearts 3.
Well, Square likes to tease games that aren't
And that's all I'm asking for.
Just let me know it's really happening.
Remind me that Kingdom Hearts 3 is happening.
Remind me that you're not going to do this weird-ass spin-off that makes no sense to a seven-year-old like you were trying to show at the end of Kingdom Hearts 2.
Remember that ending?
That was awesome.
It was awesome, but what the fuck did it have to do with Disney?
Nothing.
What does Kingdom Hearts really have to do with Disney?
Not a lot, but damn it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't remember when it was.
I don't remember if it was this March or if it was the time before.
But we actually saw a little kid dressed up as Sora in the park in Haunted Mansion.
I thought I was with you.
We saw him in line for Haunted Mansion.
So sometimes you see it.
I don't know, but it's just random.
Because remember they were from Australia or something and the costume was really well done.
And then they asked him to leave.
No, they didn't ask him because you're allowed to be dressed up in the park if you're a kid.
Anyhow, I've ever seen one thing in the park, Kingdom Hearts related, one thing, official Disney in the park, and that was a California venture in the collectible store they were selling where they sell all the little mini statues.
I saw Sora.
That's the only thing I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related.
Really?
I haven't seen that at all.
Yes, and it was gone when I looked again this last time I was there.
So I guess it's kind of like Where's Waldo across two theme parks.
Where's Sora?
Good luck.
Anyhow.
More stories, if we could.
DarkSakura.
Well, as I mentioned, I believe it was last week, there was the rumor about Wolfenstein 3D coming out.
And it is going to be on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
It will be June 4th and June 5th, respectively.
That means Xbox fans, get it first!
Ha ha!
Bringing it home.
Huh?
That's part of the E3's Bring It Home.
Or, you know, where Microsoft does that Bring It Home thing.
Oh, okay.
They have demos.
I bet you anything we're going to see a Lost Planet 2 demo coming this week.
Since they said they were going to do that anyways.
Maybe I'll get some cool new shirts for my avatar.
Whoopty shit.
But there will be actually...
Of course, achievements, whatever you want to call it.
And also for the new Wolfenstein game, you can earn accolades and be awarded gold for customizable weapon upgrades for the new Wolfenstein.
So that'll be pretty cool.
And that, of course, is coming out on August 4th.
No idea on price yet.
Sorry.
I don't know.
Probably $10.
I want to shoot Hitler in the head.
It should be $5.
I want to shoot a giant pixelated Hitler.
I mean, Wolfenstein 3D, honestly, unless they did something really cool with this, which I heard about the whole integration with the new Wolfenstein or whatever.
I'm sorry, that's not enough.
Unless they did something really fucking cool, like suddenly put multiplayer in it somehow, which I doubt they did, I don't think it's worth it.
Yeah.
The game was not that great by today's standards.
Was it an important and revolutionary game at the time?
Yes.
But does it hold up to today's standards?
Hell the fuck no.
You are going to download this and be, why did I waste $10?
Remember Pub Games?
Fable 2?
Remember how that was going to integrate stuff?
Remember how crappy those were?
Yeah.
I'm not falling for that twice.
Sorry.
I'm going to get it.
I love- I freaking love Wolfenstein.
I love Doom, and I also love Duke Nukem 3D.
Bought both of those, played them for about- 30 minutes.
30 minutes, and then that was it.
And you're like, yay, nostalgia.
Okay, done now.
I will- I will bet money.
I will bet money DarkSakura does the same thing.
She'll buy it, play it for 30 minutes, and be done.
That is if I actually go through with buying it.
And it's nothing against her.
I'm just saying, it's the same thing, the same nostalgia bug.
I say that with crap anyway.
The same nostalgia bug that you and me.
Honestly, honestly, honestly, this is really what I'm going to do is probably just freaking download it and play it on my computer like, you know, God intended.
Marissa Conguso in chat says, anyone remember Heretic?
Hell yeah!
I'm sorry.
I was the big Hexen fan.
Now if that and Hexen come out on Xbox Live, we will play that for hours.
Guaranteed.
We will stream it on the internet to prove it.
I will go on leave from work and play it.
We will play like eight hours of that game on a weekend.
We will do it.
I will watch Rob do it too.
Gee, thanks.
You're a real pal.
No, I'd play.
I'd do it.
All right, good, because I might want to sleep at some point or eat, I don't know, during those eight hours.
You're not allowed to eat anymore, Rob.
If you release, what, Heretic or Hexen or both or which one?
You should do a pack.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There are too many bets being made tonight, and I'm really afraid the public is going to win one of them.
You know what, Rob?
My thought is on bets.
I never intend on going through with them, so why?
You're a bad bet maker.
I fully intended on going through with the Eye of Judgment thing.
If somebody says, hey, we heard about this bet, we just sold another 750,000 copies of it, which will never happen, but if it did...
Then yes, I would go through with the bet.
He wouldn't have half-assed it either.
The wife would have made the costume.
It would have been tremendous.
Things that could have been, but no, nobody had to buy Eye of Judgment.
We're even going to have him go through the happy tingle dance.
When Loki makes the bet, he makes the damn bet.
I will say this.
I've done this show with Loki a long time, known the man many years.
He is a man of his word.
And God forbid they try to make a sequel and no...
I don't think I will.
We'll have to look at it.
Yeah, it depends.
Don't say anything until you see it because the sequel could be cool if there is one.
So you want to watch it, Loki.
Watch it.
Something that probably will be cool, but I won't be picking it up.
Guitar Hero 5.
It will be coming out a little bit earlier this year, September 1st.
And of course, new to Guitar Hero 5 will be a new party play mode where you can mix up what instruments you have.
And also, I think drop in and drop out play as well, which is kind of sweet.
And there's also a full confirmation of all the artists that will be featured in the game.
And...
Blur, Blink-182, Iron Maiden Duran Duran, Tom Petty
Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, David Bowie, Johnny Cash One that made me excited, Rammstein Beck, Garbage, Billy Idol Finally, one that made me perk up, I love Garbage Queen and David Bowie That means we're getting under pressure Probably
I just bought Guitar Hero 5, son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
That's like the one song I have to have.
You all know it.
You out there listening, you know there is that one song you have to have.
If you haven't already got it, there's that one song you have to have that's going to make you buy the game regardless.
And he just said it.
Elton John.
Oh man, there's like...
I don't know, it looks pretty cool.
And Deep Purple.
Maybe we'll get Highway Star in there again.
I love Highway Star.
Alright, sweet.
And that's just a selection of some of the stuff there.
But they have the full list that's out there now.
Apparently it was leaked out by a UK magazine.
I believe the UK equivalent to Rolling Stone or something.
Posted the full list.
But we'll hear more about Guitar Hero 5.
You'll actually get to see it in a few days.
All right, well, we got just a little more news for you, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week, and this has to do with Nintendo.
Now, the leaks aren't just kept to Sony.
Nintendo might have leaked some things out thanks to some trademarks they've been filing.
One of the trademarks that have been filed, Wii Fit Plus.
Boom!
Boom!
Boom!
WeFit Plus is a real deal.
WeMotion Plus is going to be supported.
That's a big part of this game, is that now they'll be able to detect the motion a little better, and it's going to have online functionality.
Very limited online functionality.
This is probably just sharing data across the internet so you can motivate each other, which is okay.
I mean, it's not something to buy the game over, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's not a bad thing.
I gotta say, I'm very interested in Wii Fit Plus.
As embarrassed as I am to say it, I'm interested to see what they do with it.
I know, and that's kind of cool that they're putting out another game that some of these people that bought Wii Fit are gonna buy, but they just keep putting out sequels to games that they already have.
And yes, I know that everybody releases sequels, but my god, okay?
Seriously, let's see here.
Wii Sports Resort.
Wii Sports 2, basically, which has games that repeat themselves
Okay, hold up, though.
Isn't Wii Sports, like, if it's not the top-selling console game of all time at this point, one of the top?
Come on.
They've got to have a Wii Sports 2.
That may be true.
You know there's going to be a Mario, which, by the way, next part of the story, rumor is the Mario is the big unveiling at E3, the new Mario game.
Why aren't we seeing anything new, anything innovative?
It's basically just rehashes of...
Old stuff.
Because the rehashes are what people want to see.
Hey, guess what?
We could have had more motion sensors, but we were cheap and decided not to put it in there.
But hey, now if you buy this, buy more accessories that we're going to sell you now, you can buy the same game again with now some online functionality, which should have been in there in the first place.
And you can have some enhanced motion capturing that should have been in there in the first place.
Awesome!
I get to pay for your mistakes.
Again.
Oh, wait, no, I don't have to because I'm not buying it.
Comments from chat, chat.orangeandreta.com Tell us what you really feel.
Redertainment says, next year they'll have Wii Fit++ with Wii Motion+, Wii Vision+, and Wii Internet+.
Marissa Congusto says, I refer back to my old comment that video games are turning into porns with multiple sequels and endless sequel numbers.
Same content, different cast.
INGN0 The only non-Nintendo game that is good on the Wii is Mad World.
by the way one other thing I wanted to say one other game that was trademarked by Nintendo Art Academy so maybe that's something new question mark hope it's Mario Paint 2 that would be cool now okay well wait a minute you just said you didn't want to see sequels and now you're like give me Mario Paint 2 that would be new though okay that would be new they could do more innovative stuff with Mario Paint 2 now if they just put Mario Paint new Wii Control you know Mario Paint or whatever
with the Wii controls now to the old game, then yes, that would be rehashed crap.
But this is basically Wii Fit.
Maybe they'll have some different mini-games in there.
Whoopee!
And they're going to just throw it back at the consumer again.
And guess what?
The Nintendo consumer is dumb enough to buy this stuff again, and so the cycle will never end, and the people who actually want to play good games on the system will never get to play those good games.
So you know what?
You just have to move on, which I have.
Ranma in chat says, with all these motion controller adapters, it's just a matter of time before we see Masturbation the game.
And that is what we're hoping to see from the Korean developers at E3.
And damn it, if Masturbation the game is at E3, OLR will bring it to you, because no one else will.
No one else will want to.
No one else will want to touch it, literally.
Fanboy wank the game.
We did play 3 Feel that one time.
We extensively covered 3 Feel on this show.
And what the hell ever happened to that game?
That's what I love about E3.
I'll play all these games.
I will never fucking see again.
Whatever happened to that one game that was like a 360 game about some guy that was like Spring Break or something.
You can go on panty raids and stuff like that.
Remember, whatever happened to that?
I don't know.
You know what did come out?
Tulip came out.
Chulip did come out, finally.
The smooching game.
After like two years.
And Xtango.
Still no Xtango.
We need an Xtango.
I'm sorry, that game had so much potential.
We should go hunt these people down and go, why the hell haven't you released your game, you lazy bastard?
Give me some Xtango or I'll smack you down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, guys.
Hold on.
Serious moment here.
The reality of the situation is none of those games could get picked up because of the fact people are wanting their Mario 2s and people are wanting more of the same thing.
Serious, guys.
These games fizzled because they couldn't get the backing.
No, they could have put it on Xbox Live Arcade.
They could easily do that.
Or on XNA.
Well, define easily.
The money dries up at some point.
Who's paying for it?
The game's done.
Just port it.
They just need a distributor.
Somebody has to port it.
You have to pay someone to port it.
It's not just presto chango, it's on Xbox Live.
There's small game publishers out there that will do that.
I mean, there's people picking up rights to like M&M's and fucking Jelly Belly and stuff because they think that's an awesome IP.
Oh my god, it's recognizable, but no one wants to play the game.
Because people buy that shit.
I mean, if I put out a game that was like Nabisco something or other, I mean, no one's going to pick that up.
Lego my ego, you know, the game.
Nabisco presents Xtango.
I would play Nabisco Presents X-Tango.
Dancing for Oreos.
I would play Cookie Dancing.
Purina Dog Chow Presents.
Oh, great.
X-Alpo.
X-Alpo.
Anyways, I'm going to look and see what happened to Three Feel.
Will you do that during the break?
Will you try to research?
I want to find out what happened to Three Feel, X-Tango, and what was the other one?
Anything that we've talked about from the old Kensha Halls day.
Because it's been like three years since we've been doing E3 because we didn't get invited the hotel years.
So the years that don't count.
All right.
Look, we got the classic game of the week we got to get to.
We got to find out what's happened to some really old games.
Really old?
DarkSakura is going to dig through her archive of games and find a game to highlight just for you guys and what the heck is going on with it.
It's called the Classic Game of the Week.
Here it is here on Orange Lounge Radio.
What is the Classic Game of the Week that all the kids should be playing, DarkSakura?
The Classic Game of the Week is I'm actually going into the arcade archives.
Even though there were home releases of this, I'm going to really focus on the arcade version.
And that's a game called Starblade.
And yeah, I put up our customary, you know, audio thing, but there's really not a lot of music.
But for when it came out, it had some pretty good audio.
So this particular game was in a special pod cabinet.
Um...
Put out by Namco.
And it was running on the Namco System 21 hardware at the time.
This game came out when I think I was still in... Yeah, I was still in high school.
It came out in 1991.
And I was all over this game.
My dollar theater had it.
And the guys there used to put it on free play for me.
So I have beaten Starblade a number of times.
But the way that it goes is you have a really large 2-axis 4-button controller with an LED lamp.
So basically you flash it as you shoot them.
When you get hit, the seat rumbles and you get strobes going off so that it would be like...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You are flying out through space and you're shooting all the bad guys.
They have big flashing red sections kind of like it did in Star Fox.
Basically you just go around and just shoot stuff.
It's a lot of fun.
It's a lot, a lot of fun.
Really kind of a difficult game too.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Galaxian 3 Project Dragoon
No, but I wanted to say really quick.
I can see this game's influence on Star Fox.
This game looks a lot like Star Fox to me.
It's a mix of Star Wars, the arcade game, and Star Fox.
I never played this game back in the day, but it looks a lot like it.
Just the graphics, the way things flash that you are supposed to target and kill.
Wow.
Well, Galaxian 3 is a walk-in style game that runs off a laser disc and the arcade hardware, so it has some pre-rendered stuff going on in the background.
It's super awesome, too.
But it was out for Namco's Theater 6 arcade system, which the only other game that came out was Attack of the Zulgir.
The cool thing about this, though, is that actually a lot of the audio from Starblade made it into Galaxian 3.
The path of the game is almost identical, you know, through the asteroid field with battleships, going through the planet, desert canyons, blah, blah, blah.
And the music in it was a rearrangement of Starblade.
So Starblade led directly to Galaxian 3.
It's a predecessor.
Also, do you know how Tekken 5 had their loading screens?
They had different games?
Starblade was in Tekken 5 so that always made me go someone in chat actually recognized that too and it was unlockable in the arcade history area of the game and Starblade also shows up in Ridge Racer 7 as a wheels manufacturer so it has wheels from the game there was supposed to be a sequel to it that was called Starblade Operation Blue Planet but the game never made production
It was supposed to be running on the Namco Orbs cabinet with a projector and a slide-in seat and everything.
It's supposed to be pretty neat.
But it never happened, which is a damn shame.
Bye.
But that's totally my game of the week.
All right, there you have it.
Your classic game of the week, Starblade, on the arcade.
I'm sorry, that's a game that still, I think, holds solid today.
It may look a little dated, but if you can find one in the cabinet, plunk the money into it, it's well worth it.
All right.
Very well-received pick by the chat room as well.
A lot of fans of that game in chat.
It is seriously, for arcade games, it's one of my favorites.
All right.
Well, we are going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
I need to rest my voice.
I need to get some more tea or something hot to drink because you can hear I'm getting the whole puberty thing going on again.
I have tons of tea.
And we're going to rest a little bit.
Our voices take a quick break.
Come back in Part B. We haven't even touched Microsoft News yet.
And believe me, there's a lot of it.
So we're going to get to that after the break.
And, of course, your call is a little later on.
It's probably going to be a bit of a long show tonight.
So buckle up and hold on.
We'll get through it together, guys.
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the 31st of 2009, where we are taping live on All Games Radio, as we do every Sunday night.
The fun begins around 6 o'clock Pacific, but sometimes we're on the phone with Bobby Blackwolf, the guy who goes before us with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and it will cause us to start a little late, as what happened tonight.
But that's okay.
We've still got plenty of stuff to talk to you guys about, so let's get right back into it.
enough BS hopefully you've already heard part A I don't know why you would I guess maybe if you're joining us late here live on this Sunday evening the shame on you for missing part A but you missed a lot about Sony and Nintendo now we're going to get into Microsoft news right Loki?
Yes, the rumored Zune HD is real.
Microsoft has now officially unveiled it.
And what it will do is also tie the Zune Marketplace into the Xbox 360, which is going to be pretty cool.
They're actually planning on mainly adding, I think, the music portion of the Zune Marketplace, perhaps showing you'll be able to...
Buy the Zune Pass and stuff like that so you can download songs.
Also, they're going to have maybe a different music service on top of that that's going to be similar to the Zune Marketplace for the 360, which is kind of cool.
And the system itself actually looks pretty sleeker.
I don't know.
It looks kind of neat.
And a lot bigger screen.
I don't know.
It's pretty cool.
I'm sure they're going to show a little bit.
Even though it's not really gaming, they may show a little bit more of it during a Microsoft Press conference tomorrow.
I don't know.
It looks kind of cool.
I kind of want to get one.
Really?
Really?
Maybe.
I don't know.
I have my new stereo in my car.
This is interesting though from you because you usually are not a big portable person.
I know you have a lot of iPhone hate, but it would be interesting to see you get the Zoom out of all this.
What is it about this that makes you excited?
Well, apparently they're going to integrate the Zune into Xbox Live, creating a game-changing entertainment experience, as they say.
But that could be just a whole bunch of PR fluff.
I don't know.
I have to see what functions they're actually going to do.
Remember they were talking back before that they're going to have X and A games available to play on the Zune, so that might be kind of cool.
I don't know.
We'll see.
I probably won't end up actually getting one, but it would be neat to see what they're going to offer for it.
All right, well, I guess we will see what happens as more is revealed on the Zune HD.
I'm sure this is going to be one of the big things at Microsoft's press conference, which is weird, though, because this is not necessarily games unless they're going to be talking about the gaming aspect of it, right?
Probably, yeah.
I hope it's something.
I'm sure they're going to try to do something like X and A for the Zoom.
It only makes sense because they'd be competing with Apple in that sense because they're going to have a marketplace that has applications and games similar to the Apple App Store.
Most importantly, however, will it blend?
That's the big question.
No way.
No way.
I don't really know why they would need to make competition for PlayStation Home.
I don't think
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and how many people do you honestly know that are going to sit down at the Sony PlayStation and go, okay, I'm going to go into home to launch this game, right?
Nobody really does that except maybe the one time to check out how it works.
You know, there isn't a lot of draw in home to make that the place I start my gaming experience right now.
Maybe Microsoft, if they build this into a future NXE, is going to make something like home the place to start your gaming experience.
Well, they're going to have to do a lot.
XBLA announces Uno Clusterfuck I would check out Uno Clusterfuck I would play Uno Clusterfuck I could be with 300,000 people all at once Drop 4, bitches!
I could see that Uno Clusterfuck That'd be fun So we'll see what happens I doubt this will be an announcement at E3 this year anyway Maybe next year, who knows
Oh, maybe.
Well, how about some other stuff, though?
How about it?
How about betas?
Beta, beta, betas.
I thought you couldn't get those anymore.
It was all VHS now.
But I'm pumped.
This was me blinking at Rob.
There was the 1 vs. 100 beta.
It was going on in Canada.
Or as some people say, Canadia.
I say Canada.
It is supposed to be, though, coming to America as of June 1st.
So if anyone cares, there you go.
Microsoft's bringing it home, beta style.
And all of us that are traveling to E3 won't get a chance to play this, really, unless we bring our Xboxes with us.
I suppose I could try playing it.
Yeah, but weren't you asking me before the show, what the hell is this?
I've been hearing about it, and honestly, I was like... But have you ever seen the game show?
No, I don't watch TV.
Because it wasn't that great.
I mean, for one, it wasn't that great.
But if you heard a lot of good things about it, would you watch it, maybe?
Check it out?
No.
You didn't have that buzz with us.
He's not doing anything.
He just goes to E3.
But...
I would like to quote a line from Wayne's World.
Monkeys might fly out of my butt.
So you don't see yourself playing it.
No.
Red Entertainment says, am I only going to be able to play 1 vs. 100 only at a set time during the day?
Yeah, I think that's how I understand it set up, right?
Like they have show times, but I think it's not like they only let 101 people in.
No, it's people in the audience, there's also the actual mob, which is 100 people, and then there's the players.
Interesting.
So I would have thought maybe they have 30 different games, but they're all going at the same time.
That way everybody gets to be in the mob, but they're not going to do it that way, huh?
No, it doesn't quite work like that.
I think you have to register or something.
Well, that sucks.
What if I want to actually get to play the game?
Fat chance, right?
No, you will not.
This is where the $300,000 comes in.
SonOfDad says, only good thing about 1v100 is Bob Saget, who will not be a part of this.
And BlackWolf is correcting us, saying, no registration.
The reason there's a showtime is because there's a live host who conducts interviews.
That's kind of cool.
Screw the live host.
We don't need a live host.
Well, I mean, no, I like the idea of a live host.
I just kind of thought, I don't know, I thought... Just outsource it to India.
To a common... Oh, God.
So we can have it 24 hours.
Can you imagine?
Wow.
I don't know who you are anymore.
That still earns me the Who Cares award of the week.
I'd care.
I'm a big fan of game shows.
I want to check this out.
Primetime Survivor.
I would be all over that game.
Tooth and Nail playing Primetime Survivor.
I hope that's the next game.
Or was it The Amazing Race?
Any of those games.
I don't know how you play The Amazing Race on Xbox.
I don't think that would work.
Tap A to run.
Tap A to be amazing.
Alright, anyhow.
Well, you know, 1 vs. 100 still weighs off from actually coming out.
But Sims 3, that's on its way out later this week.
And already!
and DarkSakura.com.
And then props.
Is that a new verb you just invented?
Nippliest?
The most... Nipple-less.
The most nippliest women.
No, nipple-less.
Oh, nipple-less.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were using it to describe somebody.
She was quite nipply.
That actually is the word that people use, Rob.
Oh, I guess that's true, but not to just say it's cold.
I would not be able to take credit for that phrase.
I believe Chevy Chase said it a long time ago in Christmas Vacation.
It's a bit nipply outside.
Alright, whatever.
Fine.
That is true.
So, and then, besides that, The Sims 3 apparently, within the first four days of its online debut...
It had been downloaded 180,000 times.
And apparently they claim that you are playing a non-final, unauthorized copy of The Sims 3.
Which is crap.
Yes, that is absolute crap, because I can tell you right now, retailers have had this game for two weeks now.
So, it's absolute crap, and what they mean by non-final is that you haven't registered it, so you can't download the other town they have available, Riverview, and also you get 1,000 sim points that you can buy virtual objects with.
But, you know what, it's only a matter of time before that gets leaked too, so just give it time.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yes, Bor will not get any more of my money.
I don't know, I feel like there's so many other games for me to play right now, I don't know if I could get sucked into Sims 3, but I'll watch Jamie play it, and if it looks interesting, I'll buy it.
I only want to kill naked Sims in this game, so I can't see myself actually spending money and time to play this game.
So all I'm going to do is download the Uncensored patch, download the new skins that make naked Sims, because that's funny for some reason.
Naked Sim party, naked Sim death party.
I have naked Sims.
and, you know, the other costumes and skins that they have, like the Make a Joker Sim and, you know, just ridiculous stuff.
And then just...
Kill them all in really interesting ways.
And that's how I'll spend an evening.
And then we're done.
Then I don't play it ever again.
That's what happened to The Sims.
And then every now and then I'll go back to it, reinstall it, and do it all over again.
And then we're done.
So I really don't see a point in me buying this full retail game for this.
I don't care about the other town.
I don't need another town to visit to kill The Sims in this way.
It's just...
You don't want to kill the Sims in the other town?
I guess I could.
Why not?
I just don't really care.
and totally enjoyed it.
DarkSakura, have you ever gone on the naked death spree in The Sims?
No, not yet because I told you I'm too busy building houses.
I was trying to make a haunted house once and there was another time that the mailman came and then I trapped them with a moat and that was funny too because they couldn't figure out how to leave and then I killed the mail person by starving them to death.
I would love to see like a real absurd Sims type game.
Maybe this game exists somewhere.
Someone will have to tell me.
Like a very absurd Sims type game or an add-on that is all about the horrific death of your Sims.
Why not?
I don't know if you remember this.
They had a freeware game that someone made called Lamers and it was a spin-off of Lemmings where you had a gun and different weapons and you shot the Lemmings as they ran across the street.
All the stuff would be AI-driven so they would be doing the builders and that kind of stuff.
But no, you couldn't let them get to the home.
You had to kill them.
I would play that.
It was awesome.
I bet it's online somewhere.
Just look up Lamers.
The freeware Lemmings spit on.
I hate Lemmings.
Yeah, Lemmings was awesome like 10 years ago.
Lemmings reminds me of people I know.
But now, like, Lemmings, they re-released it for the PSP and the PlayStation 3.
Like, it's popular all over again or something.
I don't know.
I can't talk.
I had a fan site for drawings I would do.
Just because apparently the only thing I could draw at one time was Lemmings.
Sonic R
I love Sonic R!
Oh my god.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't even understand, okay?
I'm sure it was one of your games of the week before.
Yeah, actually I think it has been, but I was so... The one thing I was super mad about Vista is that I couldn't play Sonic R unless I play in compatibility mode, then it fucks up my resolution.
What does this game sound like to you?
No!
Thanks for watching!
Sonic Plus Monkeys.
Did you just say Sonic Butt Monkeys?
No, Sonic Plus Monkeys.
That's what the game is.
And the DS in 2010.
I wonder if Ulala will be in it.
I swear you said Sonic Butt Monkeys.
Instant purchase if Ulala's in it.
Well, remember, she was in Sega Superstar Tennis, I believe.
So, um...
I fucking hate that Sega keeps teasing Ooh La La in front of us, though.
Like, remember Space Channel 5?
Too bad you're never gonna see another one.
I wonder if we're gonna have if Ooh La La's in it, if Space Michael will be in it.
Nope.
Don't hold your breath.
I like Space Michael.
It's the only cool incarnation he's had since, you know, Thriller, when he was a zombie.
Leo Shen agrees with me.
I will only buy this game if Ooh La La is a guest again.
She was in Riders.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Um, Sega is going to be doing downloadable vintage games on Xbox Live Arcade.
Um, starting off with one of the pinnacle of video games, Gunstar Heroes, on June 10th.
And, of course, the next day it'll be out on PlayStation Network.
Um, it is actually, um...
That's the only one that's supposed to be coming out on PlayStation Network so far but there were seven other titles announced for Xbox Live Arcade which I think that I've already covered this.
Arcade Shinobi, Comic Zone, Altered Beast, Sonic 3, Phantasy Star 2, Sonic & Knuckles, and Gunstar Heroes.
Great, except for the fact I already own that Sega collection.
Do you know how many copies of Gunstar Heroes we have in Gunstar Superheroes?
And, you know, all versions of... And let me guess, this will be one more because you need the achievements, right?
It's Dan.
He'll get it.
He'll get it.
I know he'll get it.
By the way...
Loki found that clip of Lamers on YouTube that we were talking about earlier.
I think I've played that game before.
I think I played it before.
It looked very familiar to me.
Can you link that in chat?
I know this does no good for our podcast listeners, but can you at least link it in chat so they can kind of see what you're looking at here?
I just saw the best mashup game, Rob.
What's that?
Mashup game of the week.
Worms and Lemmings.
Wait, is this a real game or something you want to exist?
I'm going to start my mashup game of the week.
That's a lot.
Mashup game.
It is worms and lemmings.
Imagine your lemmings are running around and you blow them up with the... That's what this is.
Look at this.
Well, no.
You actually wage war on each other and your lemmings are your innocent bystanders.
WarGames WarGames
It might have.
Because the thing was, let's play Global Thermonuclear War.
Yeah, maybe it was that, but it came out much later than the movie was out.
I remember it was on VGA and all that.
They have this game available for download in the DOS Museum.
Nice.
I linked it in chat.
Very nice.
Thank you.
So you can check that out, dosmuseum.com.
Just look for Lamers.
And yes, you just gun down people.
That's all you do.
Somewhere right now in the world, a phone call is being made from an angry parental association.
Some folks in chat remember the game, too.
Redertainment says they're in chat.
Chat.orangeonsradio.com I remember playing this game.
When I saw the YouTube, then I was like, oh yeah, I have played this before.
Anyhow, more news.
Sorry, Loki.
So there's a possibility, according to Volition, that they may port Saints Row or Red Faction to the Wii.
And that's pretty awesome.
I guess during the Red Faction Guerrilla launch event in New York, someone apparently asked them about that.
And they said, though THQ may do Wii versions of our games in the future...
Volition won't be doing them, at least not for the next year or so.
So they may have another party or another company port them over.
I don't know.
I think Saints Row on the Weave is pretty awesome.
Why is that?
Even though graphically it would probably have to be scaled down, but what is it just with the motion control and everything?
Yeah, it'd just be murdering things.
Yeah, but wasn't that what Manhunt 2 was supposed to be?
And look how that turned out.
Yeah, but there's other games that are like that that are fun, like Scarface.
Scarface was pretty fun, and it was kind of the same type of game.
But just Saints Row is really over the top.
But yeah, I would rather see a Saints Row 3.
Saints Row is kind of one of those overlooked type friends.
How did the second one sell?
Not very well.
Yeah, it's too bad.
I'm actually planning on picking up the other expansion pack.
I still haven't played the last expansion pack that they had come out.
I've been too busy with other things, but I do want to go back to it because it's pretty fun.
I also have Left 4 Dead I haven't played yet and Fallout 3.
All these games that are just sitting waiting.
Oh, and Killzone 2 and Resistance 2.
It's too much.
All right, well, moving on with some more gaming news.
Another series that seems to be making a comeback, Trauma Team.
This is coming out from Atlas.
It's putting this out on the Wii.
And yes, this does appear to be in the same vein as Trauma Center and all that.
This is now Trauma Team is the game that's going to be coming out on the Wii.
It's going to be gameplay six different medical fields.
So you're not just necessarily a doctor now.
You're going to be a general surgeon, diagnostician, orthopedic surgeon, endoscope technician.
Oh great, you can do colonoscopies in a video game now.
Now I've heard everything.
Medical Examiner and EMT.
Very interesting.
Dude that mops up hospital rooms.
I just, I am shocked.
Because you know what an endoscopy is?
Yes, I do know it.
That's where they put a tube in your body somewhere.
So like, either you're going to be doing examinations down the mouth and throat, which I guess is probably likely, or up a butt.
This could be very interesting gaming.
is Trauma Team about me when I play it and not the victims in the game?
It'd be even better if you could do it.
Will it be Katie Couric showing it live on TV?
Do they have two-player in the last game?
I think they did, yes.
They should have two-player in this.
Except you would never want to play with me because I'd be like, let's play tic-tac-toe on his colon.
But it looks like, look at this, you're pounding on a guy's chest in this screenshot here.
God damn it, Liv!
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor.
That would be awesome if they had some sort of vocal recognition software or something in there.
It's like Karaoke Revolution, so you gotta yell a phrase or something.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look at this picture here.
I gotta link this in chat.
Look at this.
Some person lifting up their shirt, exposing their bra while the doctor's operating on them.
This is like little kids playing doctor realized it's a video game.
It's not a mastectomy.
Wow.
Wow, we're looking at Grey's Anatomy the game now.
Apparently.
My gosh.
Except Grey's Anatomy the game sucks.
Tigerclaw in chat says the tagline for the game would be explore your anus.
Okay, that was probably one of the single most beautiful things I've ever heard from a listener ever.
Boldly go.
Do it!
Oh my god, do it.
You have to do it right.
Do we have the option?
Do we have an option of leaving a sponge behind?
Oh, crap.
Like, you have to count the sponges and stuff and make sure that they're all there and then you don't.
And then later on, you know, it flashes to a cut scene where the guy's, like, feeling, you know, like, chest pains and stuff like that.
I can see the scenario now.
All right.
Scenario one.
Okay, here it is.
You've got the diagnostician is playing with the endoscopy.
It's like your team here.
So, okay, this patient has come in and is complaining of pains.
Okay.
and he's feeling some little tapping pains in his rear end and him and his partner were playing with gerbils a little while ago you gotta diagnose and treat someone put gerbils up his butt let's operate do we get to hear the Lemmy Winks song at that time?
this could be the most beautiful video game of all time this has so much potential so much potential
And then when they die on the operating table, then we have the spin-off, you know, the Phoenix Wright or the Ace Attorney series, you know.
Medical malpractice, Ace Attorney.
TheLegendOfZaku, we are so mature tonight.
TheLegendOfZaku in chat says, I seriously want to leave a junior mint on the patient before I stitch him up.
What, so your farts start smelling minty?
No, didn't you see that?
No, what?
No.
It's from Seinfeld.
They had a junior mint, they're watching an operation and they drop a junior mint and it gets into his body.
It makes him really sick, I guess.
What would happen if you really left a Junior Mint in someone's body?
It would suck.
You would not be happy.
That's all.
You would not be happy.
Alright.
This is getting way too... Frisbee is mentioning the sequel, Morgue Center.
Death is upon us.
Dude!
God, I love our chatters.
That is seriously the most fantastic name ever.
I love our chatters so much.
All right.
Look, we love the listeners so much.
Let's do a segment dedicated to them.
No!
Yes.
Why they hate.
You've just lavished praise upon our listeners for their genius comments tonight, DarkSakura.
And now you know what segment I'm getting to and you're complaining.
I'm sorry to take you away from house building, but it is that time where we open up the mailbag.
and read your emails at mailbag at orangelaundry.com and see what you guys have to say.
By the way, Marissa Congusto, you could die.
You would get a terrible infection.
That's what would happen with the Junior Men.
Just so you know.
See, chat room can answer the questions that we can't sometimes.
All right, DarkSakura, open up the old email bag at mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
You're going to have to put your house building away.
I know.
I was saving.
All right.
And let us know.
Look at this, Rob.
Look at this.
Oh, she's up and ready to go.
I had it ready.
Alright, email number one.
Dear OLR.
Dear Rob, I think you should stop giving Jamie a hard time and go eat a Junior Minute.
Love, OLR member number one.
Okay, first one is Cheeseburger.
Hey guys, last week I was listening live on my PSP, so cool, and was not in the chat room.
The thing I wanted to chime in was the discussion of arcade cabinets.
I don't remember who said they would kill for an original Star Wars arcade machine, but I would so kill for an original Star Wars arcade machine.
I'm 15, so obviously didn't grow up in the 80s, but I have always thought, and everyone tells me, that I was born in the wrong decade.
I would give anything to have grown up in the 80s.
No, Reagan, that's all.
I roam eBay for countless hours for classic video games.
I watch all of the AVGN videos and, well, the Angry Video Game Nerd, to translate.
And while this email is getting too long, my longest OLR email so far, I'm going to shut up.
P.S.
Sky, I mess around with iPod custom firmware and would like to make an OLR custom firmware for iPod, so could you send me or link me to some OLR picks to work with?
I will totally forget that request, so send me a message to my personal email at rob at orangeandre.com and I will be happy to do that.
Also, I do want to commend our dear friend Cheeseburger for vastly improving in spelling and grammar.
The most improved award!
You win a shiny, shiny gold star.
Seriously!
This is probably one of the most legible emails I've received from Cheeseburger.
Here you go, have a Junior Mint.
You get a golden Junior Mint, which you don't want to know why it's gold.
Next email!
This is from Alpha Cananogram.
Dear OLR, this is a quick last minute email.
Well, it's a lot longer than I thought it would be, actually.
I plan on getting a PSP Go, but I'm keeping my PSP 2000, which has the earliest motherboard and firmware version 3.90.
The one I had to fix and asked y'all's advice.
God, I miss people saying that.
advice on removing that damned stripped screw, which I finally got out.
I pre-ordered a game that comes out in a month that is on UMD.
I'm importing slash paying for this one since it comes with a physical pre-order bonus that you can't pirate.
But I have just realized that I haven't bought any recent PSP games that require a firmware update since my PSP's D-pad was previously broken for the longest time until recently.
And this game probably will have a firmware update on it that will want to be installed before the game can be played.
The thing is, with multiple commas, is that I still want to hack this PSP and play the game without updating, but I have no Pandora battery or Magic Memory Stick.
Do y'all know anyone or any place that is reputable and cheap or free to get either of these items from?
I probably can make the memory stick thing.
I'm not sure about the battery part.
You can make the battery, but you need to have another PSP to do that.
So borrow a friend's?
Another PSP of the custom firmware, and then there's a program that you can run to make the battery.
And then to make a battery for a 2000, it's a pain in the ass.
Because you have to do some extra steps.
But it's not that hard.
I did it.
I still have one.
Oh.
I still have one.
Also, if we're ready then for the conclusion of the email, that's answered the question.
This email has been brought to you by Yoshi's Island, home of the never-ending crying baby Marios.
Whee!
God, I hated Toys R Us when that thing was there.
Oh, man.
Did you used to play that demo?
Did you used to work at Toys R Us?
No, I just used to frequent Toys R Us when they had toys in there.
Now that it's Baby RS slash Toys R Us.
I have to say, though, Touch Fuzzy, Get Dizzy, one of the greatest stages in all of video gaming.
P.S.
I didn't notice a USB port or spot to access battery on the PSP Go pictures, comma, comma, comma.
Hmm.
Well, then again, E3 hasn't happened yet, so I suppose it is a secret to everybody.
P.P.S.
I am probably going to grammar hell, ain't I?
P.P.P.S.
to DarkSakura, comma, comma, comma, heart.
I know you did that on purpose.
Okay.
Whatever.
Next email, dun-dun-dun.
Hmm.
I think this is from Actdeft.
Yeah, it is.
Hi, OLR crew, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft.
I'm writing today to ask a couple of questions and to fill some space up in the old mailbag.
I hope you can answer them.
I'm probably getting a PSP soon, and yeah, I know the PSP Go is coming and all that stuff, but I personally think the design sucks.
Amen!
Oh my god, it looks like cell phone.
of course one of my immediate purchases is Rock Band Unplugged and I already have Prinny Can I Be the Hero and Pump It Up Portable my question is what other games should I look out for especially cheap ones since my budget isn't that big right now any type of game except SRPGs are good
Hotapon 2 and LocoRoco 2, both $20.
LocoRoco.
Luminous is one of the greatest puzzle games you'll ever play and the PSP is the platform to play it on, especially if you can find Luminous 2.
The sequel was really effing good and unfortunately didn't quite have that same magic and momentum of its first game.
Although the first game does have Shining and some really good tracks.
Luminous 2, don't overlook it.
It's a great little puzzler game.
If you can find it on the cheap, definitely pick that up.
And the Grand Theft Auto games are pretty good too.
also since you're going to be at E3 I would like to ask you to look for any info on a possible American release of Space Invaders Extreme 2 I love the first game and have the Xbox Live Arcade version I would love to have a localized version of it instead of importing it
I also want to follow up on a call of mine from a few weeks back in the Latin America release of Patapon 2, since it's download only in the States.
I searched in some stores here in Mexico a few days ago and found they were selling Patapon 2, and surprisingly it was on UMD, no download copies here apparently.
Thank God Sony did the right thing here and released it on physical media, it would have been a pain in the ass just to download the thing from the PSN store, though of course the game costs double the price in the U.S.,
Well, those are my questions for now.
I wish you a good trip to E3, Sky and Loki, and I hope you have a great time there.
P.S., bring us some E3 swag.
We just might.
Okay, I guess this is Dan Shadow.
What's your favorite kind of flour?
Mine's chocolate.
What?
Whatever.
I like tuna.
Mine's tuna.
Type of, wait, what, flour?
Flour?
The game on PlayStation 3.
I don't know.
Baking.
That's F-L-O-W-E-R.
You didn't say that.
I said flower, not flower.
You know what?
Go stuff a junior, man.
Where the sun don't shine.
How about the last email?
Of virgins.
Hello?
I see what you did there.
Okay.
You made a dumb email pretty good, Loki.
Good job.
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio crew.
This is Blue Swim from the LOL Army's Twitter division.
Over the Memorial Day weekend last week, my beloved cat of 13 years, Goldie, took ill.
After her condition worsened, I had to do the toughest thing I've ever done and had her put to sleep.
Her passing was the first time I've cried since I was a kid.
What a downer.
Why did you have to end with this one?
This is sad.
I'm so sorry to hear about that.
It's never easy to lose a pet.
It's like losing a baby.
My kitty died.
It's sad.
It's sad.
Now I'm going to be in a bad mood the rest of the night.
Oh, let me finish reading the email.
Fine.
Stop being a baby.
It wasn't uncommon for her to walk over and plop herself down on my lap while I was in the middle of playing a game.
She'd do it even while I was playing the drums and rock band.
It's actually one of my favorite gaming memories, which leads to my question for this email.
This is so sad.
Do you guys have any gaming-related memories involving a pet or pets that you've had?
Thank you for doing OLR all this time.
Keep doing what you're doing, Blue Swim.
My old cat, Madeline, really the only cat I had because I haven't had one in many years.
She passed away several years ago.
She was actually named after the actress Madeline Kahn.
That's fantastic.
Yeah, because Clue was my favorite movie growing up.
So when we got my cat, I named my cat after Madeline Kahn because, of course, Mrs. White was one of the best characters in that movie.
Anyhow, my cat would actually – while I was playing video games, my cat liked to hang out – Shermie's not on her box, I can tell you that –
My cat liked to hang out in this patio room that we had.
We had an indoor patio, and that was basically the cat's room.
My mom didn't like the cat in the house because it would get fur everywhere, but the cat basically had her own room.
But we had a glass door leading to this indoor patio.
So when I would play video games, I remember my cat would run up and just kind of stare through the door at the TV.
But we all know cats don't really see the same images we do.
It was something about the TV.
I don't know.
But when I was a young kid, I used to think, oh, she loves watching me play video games.
I remember that with my cat.
Do you have a pet-related story, Loki?
Yeah, my cat chases the Wii pointer on the screen.
Like, when Animal Crossing would come, when we'd play Animal Crossing, and the little bus logo thing would pop up on the screen, she'd get down the bottom of the TV and start pawing at it.
When I got DDR Second Mix, this was actually not too long after I first got Shermie, so she was probably about two years old at the time.
She used to hit the analog button on the Dreamcast pads and start the game for me or put me in another, you know, put me in SSR.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Marissa in chat says, that has inspired me to name a cat if I ever get one, Gilda.
What an amazing name for a cat.
What an amazing woman Gilda Ranma was, by the way.
My sons have a cat named Sylvia.
Sorry.
I'm going to get all weepy if we keep talking about these cats.
Let me see if I've got another email.
Don't we have a dick and fart joke?
Can't we tell more Junior Men jokes?
Something?
Oh, shoot, I forgot to read the very last part of that email.
Oh, okay.
In case you were curious, the title of this email, and lost a friend, is a reference to the Exploder Evacuated Part 2 radio commercial from GTA Vice City.
Now you know annoying is half the battle.
Peace.
Smiley.
Well, best of luck with, and I'm really sorry to hear about your loss.
And if your family decides to get another cat, there are many, many cats out there who need love.
Adopt a cat.
Everyone, go out there and adopt a cat.
Well, some people are allergic.
So, I'm allergic.
I have air filters in my house and I take sinus medicine every day.
I love my cat.
I will do whatever I can to keep my cat.
So, if I can't... The only thing, I won't get a dog.
Because I'm actually so allergic to dogs that allergy medicine does not touch it.
I actually... I don't know if I've ever gotten into this on the show, and maybe I shouldn't, but I actually have a fear of dogs.
It's taken me a little... Do you?
Yes, I have a definite case of fear of dogs.
It doesn't matter the size.
I get really nervous around dogs.
I've gotten a lot better with it in the past five years than I would say from the time I was five through about the time I was like 21.
It was really bad.
Like, whenever I get around dogs, I get really nervous.
Like, I...
Can't, like, be around dogs.
And this goes back to, I was bit by one when I was five, and it was very traumatic.
Be careful with that, it's older than me.
Oh, yeah.
You know what, though?
You should meet Pocket.
I think, actually, you'd scream like a little girl about Pocket.
See, here's the thing, and I don't want to disappoint you, but everybody tells me I would feel different about their dog, and I won't.
I think you'd scream like a little girl around Pocket.
Pocket is this big.
Oh, then I would scream in terror.
You want to put me in my own personal hell?
Sure, I'll do that.
She's part chihuahua and part toy something and has the loudest bark ever.
That's not even... I won't have a dog.
I won't have a dog and I don't let them in my house.
So you don't have to worry about it for me.
The only kind of dog I want is a corgi.
INGN0 and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not pronouncing your name right probably says Rob you fear guns projectiles and dogs yeah that about covers it you know I wonder if you would be okay with a Basenji
They're not really like a modern dog.
I will say this.
There has been one dog that I was able to get along with.
And it was my grandma's old Dachshund wiener dog.
Because, yeah, it was missing an eye.
So it was a handicapped dog and very, very quiet, very slow moving, very, you know, like very just peaceful dog.
So you need an old lazy dog.
I need an old lazy dog, if anything.
Well, I don't need a dog.
I will always be a cat person.
If you were to have a dog.
Which won't happen.
If someone told us to bring a dog in your house, it would have to be an old, lazy, fat dog.
Blind in one eye.
Answers to Lucky.
No offense to you dog owners out there, but just understand, this goes back to a childhood fear that I can't shake.
You have a fish called Kitty.
A fish called Puppy.
That's my roommate's.
You should get a cat.
Uh, Roommate doesn't want one.
And I understand.
So maybe later on.
Maybe later on.
But not right now.
I definitely am getting a cat at some point.
But, you know, when there's somebody else to take care of him.
If you get a boy cat named Frank.
I haven't even thought of names yet.
If I get a boy cat, his name is going to be Frank.
After Frank Converter.
Cheeseburger in our chatroom says, Rob Hell is a great Dane with mayo and guns.
Pretty much.
Pretty much that about sums it up.
All right, look, some more news because we want to take your calls.
We don't want to be here all night long.
Jeez Louise.
Yeah, you people got to get out of my house.
All right, Loki, please.
Well, I don't know if anyone remembers the old toy Madballs.
Yes.
But apparently Madballs are coming back with an Xbox Live arcade game called Madballs in Babbo Invasion.
And it's going to be an action game where you can basically like a shoot-em-up action game.
And it's going to have four-player co-op, 16-player multiplayer, and randomly generated maps.
and I have their PR guy keeps hounding me.
So we have actually a meeting with them at E3.
It's my first meeting.
So we'll find out more about it.
But, you know, when I first saw this, I'm like, Madballs, really?
Is that like a smart IP to try to bring back?
I mean, really?
But reading the comments on like some of these news stories, everybody's like really enthusiastic about it.
I'm like, okay.
Yeah.
You know who won't be playing that?
Me.
I will wait for Loki's report before I make a decision either way.
Oh, I was going to drag you along.
Oh, goody.
When is this?
Wednesday?
Noon, yeah.
Fine, I'll go.
We'll see.
It'll be short.
At least I'll feel like someone cares because I don't have a lot of meetings planned.
I find, especially with the smaller companies, if you walk up and care, they will talk your ear off.
So I'm all for it.
Why not?
Well, I don't want to spend an hour looking at this one game.
Well, yeah.
I mean, well, it depends.
It depends.
I'm going to open mind.
Open mind.
Give me a 15-minute spiel and that's it.
Well, they don't have a booth, so they don't really have anything to demonstrate.
I mean...
We'll see.
We'll see.
All right.
More to come, of course, next week.
Wait, we're not doing a show next week, are we?
Because of E3?
I'll be back.
Are you going to be back?
I'll be back, but I don't know.
We'll see.
We may or may not be here next week.
I know it's Bobby's 200th show.
He may want to go long or he might be tired too.
More to come on that if we will be here next week or not.
But we'll definitely do something to cover E3.
Anyhow.
I want to move on, though, with some of the news that came out this week, and the next story has to do with Grand Theft Auto.
This is some news that kind of got trumped a little bit by everything else, all the leaks coming out of E3, but this is certainly huge news.
The Ballad of Gay Tony
and apparently in this you will be taking on Luis Lopez, who is a part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to nightclub impresario Tony Prince, who is gay Tony.
Now, I don't know enough about the story.
Loki, please explain.
Who is gay Tony and is he just happy or is he gay?
Thank you for watching!
Both Nico and Johnny are there doing an exchange with the triads.
They're selling them diamonds.
And Louise comes in and basically robs them of their diamonds.
breaks up the whole thing and there's a big gun battle in the Museum of Natural History so that all goes down I'm not really sure what they're going to cover with this there's a lot of speculation saying because the last expansion they updated like the rock and rap stations and stuff this is going to be more of the electronica updates as far as music goes and stuff and it's supposed to focus around Algonquin his nightclub and stuff like that maybe like the safe house and stuff
Now, before you might think my feathers are ruffled being the gay guy on the show that they're naming this the Ballad of Gay Tony or whatever, I actually kind of don't care because Rockstar has a track record of handling these issues pretty good.
I mean, we remember Bully, you know, actually kind of handled it fairly interesting.
And, you know, I don't see any, you know, if it's a gay character in a story, who cares?
I think you run into Gay Tony in the first game, well, like the main storyline.
You know what it's all about and how they handle it.
Yeah.
Now, but let me tell you what pisses... Well, is there anything else you want to mention about this?
Because I'm going to segue into the FUs of the week here.
Because there is one thing about this that kind of pisses me off.
And it's the whole fact that you can call this game the Ballad of Gay Tony, but heaven forbid you can't put gay in your profile.
Remember that whole thing that came up a couple weeks ago?
Where Microsoft says you can't talk about the sexuality stuff in your profile?
But yet it's okay to name the game the Ballad of Gay Tony.
So, I see a double standard here.
And when I see double standards, I get very irritated.
Not that I want to put gay in my profile, but if somebody does, why shouldn't they be allowed to?
You know, if somebody wants to put, hi, I'm gay or whatever, then that's their prerogative.
If somebody puts, I hate gays, well, that's a lot different.
See what I'm saying?
But anyhow, there's a clear double standard here.
Double standards piss me off.
It's time for the FUs of the week.
Sorry to hear it.
Sorry I'm not laughing.
It's just funny out of everything that comes out of it.
You got that?
Sorry to hear it.
FU to housework and because my knees hurt because I've been crawling around on laminate flooring and they're all bruised so that sucks and I still have lots of painting to do and I have a lot of other stuff I have to do and we're moving in in two weeks so yikes so FU to work oh and I've been getting up at 8 in the morning working until like 6 at night I took off a day of work after morning lay of work at the house so
Yeah, long days.
But how is it being in your own house now?
It'll be cool when it's done.
We have the baseboards to do and the painting and stuff.
Luckily, my parents are helping out with the kitchen and stuff.
My dad's been really cool.
He's been coming down to actually help me during the days.
He's offered to come in during the time I'll be gone and read stuff.
He'll come in and do all the baseboards.
And my mom's going to be painting while I'm gone and stuff.
Couldn't have done it without him, so it's really cool.
But yeah, it's pretty awesome.
I'm tempted because my wife promised when we get a house, I can get an arcade cabinet.
Of course, she said that a long time ago.
So, maybe.
But I'm not building it this time.
It'll be pre-cut, pre-fab.
and I will go ahead and say my FU of the week goes to spammers oh my god I've been getting more spam on Gmail lately like I don't know what happened but over the weekend the spammers figured out how to get through or something and I've been getting spam messages like crazy on Gmail I don't know if it's just me I've been too, I've been too
I'm getting so pissed off.
I fucking hate spammers.
I fucking hate them.
Why do they do this?
They slow down the internet with all their traffic.
Do people actually buy the shit in these emails?
Do people actually legitimately believe this stuff?
And sadly, even if one person out of a million believes it, it's probably worth it to these people.
But they're just the parasites of pawn scum.
I hate it.
I hate it.
That's a pretty epic F.E., Rob.
Seriously, in countries that support spammers, we need to just drop a nuclear bomb or something.
Get rid of these people.
Alright, I'm being a little extreme.
But it is just obscene.
Like, we need to do something to stop this.
And it's not just that I'm annoyed.
I am annoyed.
It's not just that, but the fact that they slow down the internet with their poop.
that flies out of their keyboards.
I get more spam in my actual Orange Lounge account than I do... Seriously, we get inundated with the Orange Lounge and Gmail.
God!
I'm so sick of spam.
Unfortunately, it's part of the hazards of being on the internet.
However, I do not advocate just sitting back and letting it happen, of course.
All right, Bobby linked me to a website here with actually kind of a clarification, I suppose, on the whole, you called the game Gay Tony, but you can't have gay in your profile or whatever.
And this is a website called step2.com, which is, I think he's a guy who's involved with the, what is he, the community...
I don't think he's community director or something, but he does stuff with Microsoft.
Anyway, he basically says that the code of conduct policy does allow you to express vocally on the surface your relationship preference.
People get this wrong in saying all instances the word gay, for instance, are forbidden from all of Xbox Live.
Therefore, this new download content represents a violation.
This is not the case.
I appreciate the appearance of a disconnect, but there isn't.
There's other content in Grand Theft Auto 4 that would likewise not be allowed in a gamertag or profile.
Quotes from movies that you can obtain on Marketplace that are not allowed in gamertags or profiles.
Rated purchable content with all sorts of technical rules and restrictions as to what type of accounts can view them.
Limitations, synopsis, and plot summary and so forth that gamertags and profiles do not currently have.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm still not 100% convinced.
I'm thankful that they're aware that there's a disconnect here, but I don't know.
I'm not 100% convinced when we do see some of these reports coming out and so forth.
But I do appreciate the clarification, if nothing else.
And they say they're working with these organizations, etc., etc.
They've been working with them for months and months.
Let's see what happens.
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.
We're almost to the phone.
DarkSakura, if you wouldn't mind.
Well, this is... I don't know.
Tecmo Bowl for Wii is actually put on hold and is being converted into Family Fun Football.
Um...
They are basically saying that they're switching it to a family-oriented game because of market research and to go to the Wii's target audience.
Because that's everybody that owns the Wii is the family demographic and they are not going to recognize the name Tecmo Bowl.
So they're selling out.
Sad, but it makes sense.
Makes complete sense, sadly.
But on Xbox 360 there will be Tecmo Bowl for Xbox Live Arcade and that will be in early 2010.
Hunt for that at E3.
Let us know.
Cool.
There's some pretty cool stuff coming over from XSEED.
They're a company that localizes a lot of games that normally come out in Japan.
Are modern working designs?
Yes, basically.
In fact, some of the cool stuff that they're bringing to E3 this year, Ju-on the Grudge for the Wii, Fragile Farewell Ruins of the Moon, Lunar Silver Star Harmony for the PSP,
HalfMinuteHero for the PSP.
Remember that Yussa 30 game that they had?
That looks pretty sweet.
Arkrise Fantasia, Flower, Sun, and Rain, Little King Story, Ragnarok Online DS, and Valhalla Knights Elder Saga.
So lots of cool import-friendly stuff coming from them.
Probably a booth I'll have to visit.
Alright, well something else that is going to definitely appeal to some folks out there, and maybe not to others, but you might remember there was some talk about a Tony Hawk skateboard peripheral coming out very soon.
Well, some more details have leaked on Tony Hawk Ride.
That is the game, and this is from GameStop.
The game is coming out October 13th.
It's going to set you back $120.
That's right, Tony Hawk Ride, which comes with a little skateboard controller, so...
Could be interesting.
Could be dangerous, too.
I mean, God, I could just see people breaking their TVs left and right with this thing if you're having a little too much fun.
I don't know.
How much fun can this really be?
Am I just being a pessimist?
How much fun can this really be?
I mean, isn't part of riding a skateboard having wheels?
I mean, I guess you could make the same argument.
Well, how much fun is Wii Sports because it's not actual tennis?
Or why do people play Wii Bowling and not actual bowling?
I don't know.
There's something about this specifically that I'm looking at going, how can this really be fun?
This is a little curvy board that sits on your floor.
I don't know.
It'd be like, what was the arcade game?
But then again, I was defending Wii Fit earlier, so what the hell right do I have to bash this game?
I don't know.
Yeah, Rob.
No, really.
It'd be like, though, what was that one Sega game that you, you know, got to do all the... The Activator?
No, I'm talking about the arcade.
It would be something along those lines, I think.
You know... Oh, oh God, Alpine Racer.
Well, no, they had the skateboard game.
It was similar to that, though.
I know what you're talking about.
Trish State or something?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I guess, but even that, I don't know, had movement or something.
I mean, it wasn't just a board that was lying on the ground.
You know what I mean?
It actually spun around.
I remember that.
You used to have the golf lamp back in the day, right?
It would actually kind of spin around, and you had the railings to hold on to.
This is not going to be that elaborate.
You still had that feeling of motion in the game because of the whole elaborate setup it had.
That's true.
That is true.
SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelandredu.com says, seriously, $120?
I can put that towards a real skateboard.
Hitstun corrects the name.
Topskater and Airtrix.
Topskater, that was it.
Airtrix is what I was actually thinking of.
And Rob D says, there were two arcade skateboarding games, but I don't remember the names.
Well, there they were.
So there it is.
Topskater.
Yeah, I think that's one of the ones I'm thinking of.
And I think we had both those games at one point at Golf Land.
But this isn't it.
I'll tell you that much.
One more story from all of us, then we're going to get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.
But first, a few more stories, DarkSakura.
Well, how about something for LEGO Indiana Jones?
This is kind of cool.
Well, for LEGO Indiana Jones 2, I should say, is that you're going to be able to build your own stages.
So basically you can do levels, tombs, challenges, sandbox areas, put down plates, traps, all that kind of fun stuff.
You can actually save everything and go back and do your playthrough again on your homemade level.
It's like Forge, but for LEGO Indiana Jones.
Yep.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
E3, Gladiator AD
An ultra bloody fighting game that puts you in the role of a roaming gladiator.
Looks pretty sweet.
And then to go along with that, something more like a normal traditional shooter.
A game called The Grinder, which is going to be kind of like a supernatural shooter game.
It's got like vampires and stuff like that and werewolves.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Sometimes a game being at E3, though, is just a trailer showing on a monitor.
You know what I mean?
A lot of these games are probably like that.
It's possible.
Maybe we will see this.
I don't know, though.
Not every game is playable.
I think we forget that a lot.
A lot of shit at E3 is not touchable.
Like everything from Square Enix.
Usually.
I bet that new Kingdom Hearts game will be playable though.
Oh yeah, it's already out in Japan.
That's what, 328.3 or whatever it's called?
Some weird name.
Again, I don't understand because I thought this was a series aimed at kind of kids and they do all this weird stuff with it, but I don't know.
I don't understand some of the Kingdom Hearts logic sometimes.
I love the games though.
I do.
I really do.
And I know I'm not going to see Kingdom Hearts 3 at this year's E3 and I'm just going to be pissed.
Oh.
Are we going to go to the theater?
Thank you.
GameGuru says 3.58, two days is the name of it.
Yeah, I'd love to go to the theater and check it out if they have it again this year, which I assume they will.
Because it's always a waste of time.
No, I mean, not that I don't like doing it.
You know what?
I actually like seeing the epic Squeenix trailers on the big screen.
It's like, oh my god, it's a trailer for Final Fantasy XI!
Look, I make this comparison.
What about when you see trailers for movies on the big screen?
Like when you saw the trailer for The Dark Knight for the first time, or when you see the trailers for Harry Potter, if you're into that or whatever.
When you see these trailers on the big screen, isn't it so much better than when you're watching them on your tiny-ass computer screen?
Same thing.
Same thing.
It depends.
It really depends.
How so?
Well, I mean, because really, sometimes there's been, I'll just see movies that I really could care less about, honestly.
So, I was like, why did I have to see this big?
Why does it have to be involved in my life right now?
So, that's what I mean.
Alright, well let's move on to one more gaming story and then we're going to take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio Please make sure if you're going to use Skype make sure you've tested your call with Echo123 as the username on Skype We had some issues last week with some of our callers so please make sure that your volume is okay by giving Echo123 a call
We got one more story for you guys, though, before we get to the phones, and it has to do with the DSi.
And I guess this is one of those, you knew this rumor would show up at some point.
I'm sure it's come up before.
Well, guess what?
It's coming up again.
Apparently, as you know, the DSi had the Game Boy Advance port removed from the game.
Well, could this possibly be because something a little shadier is in store?
You're going to soon be able to download Game Boy Advance titles onto your DSi.
Just like you download old school Nintendo games to your Wii pretty soon.
Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games on your DSi through the DSiWare store.
And move goes the cow.
I know, and the sheep will herd into this and buy this crap, I'm sure.
Tons and tons.
You know, I don't know though.
And at the same time, why can't they just put this stuff online?
I think some people forgot as well, we had a Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.
Yes, I remember that.
So they can put those games on your TV.
They'll find a Game Boy Color player on the Super NES.
That's right.
So they can put it on your TV.
So don't listen to that garbage that they can't do it.
Because they can.
They have.
Yeah, I was about to just say they can and have.
But, I mean, honestly, though, you know what the deal is for them.
In the end, the only thing that it is is the bottom line.
They can make money.
It's instant money.
It's free money.
They're going to find free money wherever they can.
That's the plan.
Anyhow, let's go to the phones.
They're ringing off the hook tonight.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's GS68.
Hello, GS68.
How you doing?
All right, I'm here to talk about Fandomate.
That's right, I don't think you were there last week while our show was going on, so how was Fandomate?
Yeah, unlike last year, I didn't get to call in at all or listen at all, so... That's all right, we had a short show last week because of the holidays, so we didn't end up doing a whole lot, and Loki wasn't here, so... And I know it hasn't gone on the podcast feed yet, but it will soon.
So what's on your mind?
How was the con?
Tell us about it.
It was pretty good.
I was mostly in the gaming room this year and I saw the most badass 2DX setup.
Like someone had actual arcade hardware hooked up to a PS2 with one of the PS2 versions of 2DX.
So my one complaint was that it was on an HDTV so it was very laggy.
That's pretty cool.
What else was in the game room?
They had a bunch of scrolling shooters like Radiant Silvergun and Gradius.
One of my friends brought his Tetris and Grandmaster arcade board so I got to play that.
I didn't really use my DS so much this year, but I will say this for Bomani fans, I'll
The arcade finally had an actual version of poppin' music.
Not NMLO2, thankfully.
Hmm.
Alright.
Matt, go ahead.
Yeah, instead of poppin' music, NMLO2 did poppin' 14.
That's good.
That's definitely worthwhile.
How about anime stuff?
I know we don't talk a lot about anime on this show, but did you see some cool stuff going on?
Any cool panels that you saw?
I know we weren't there this year, but...
I went to one gathering, but it wasn't as good as the same one from last year, and I went to a panel called Bonsai Arcade.
It was a video game trivia show panel thingy, and it was pretty awesome.
That's one thing I really want to get into doing at these cons, is these game show type things, because I think it would be a lot of fun.
Like, a lot of references to, like, older video, like, 16-bit video games, like,
Your questions are represented by enemies, and so do enemies or versions of enemies from older games like Mr. Batty from Earthbound or Dr. Robotnik from 12 Balls and Chains.
or just Labyrinth Zone Dance Party thing where if you get the question right, it ends.
But if you get it wrong, you get a sonic drown and you get to get it drowned.
Interesting.
Some people have a lot of time.
A lot of free time on their hands.
You know what's... I gotta say this because I don't think I ever said this about Anime Central when I was talking about this.
That was the most recent con I went to.
But one of the panels that they were supposed to do was like live recreations of cases from Phoenix Wright where they were going to basically do the cases from Phoenix Wright as a play.
At least that's how it read in the book.
I remember that one.
Even though I went to the Ace Attorney Gathering.
It was not what we thought it would be.
We tried to go there to the panel and it was hard to hear.
They weren't really reading off a script.
They were just kind of making it up.
It seems we left after five minutes.
We were like, god damn it, this seemed so much better in the panel.
This could have been epic.
Objection!
They could have gone off the script from the game and it would have been beautiful.
Yeah, what else?
I went to cosplay chess, which is like basically you have a chess board, two people playing chess, and then you have a bigger chess board where they represent the chess gameplay on the huge board with cosplayers.
That was pretty fun.
Any good video game cosplay that you saw?
A whole lot.
Hold on, let me just post my pictures from fun in the chat room.
That's at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
If you want to check that out, I see the link there.
Yeah, I saw a few video game cosplay gatherings, and I cosplayed as a character myself, and that was kind of funny.
Like, I went in my Paul Justice cosplay, and a lot of people recognized me.
And I went in my Poppin' cosplay, and like, only three people recognized me.
Then again, I wasn't really surprised.
What would you say was the best video game cosplay you saw?
I'm not sure.
Like,
Yeah, I saw Captain Commander cosplay, and that's pretty cool, because the cosplayer had neon lights on his costume, which was awesome.
Alright, fair enough.
Well, GS68, any other thoughts about Fandomay before we let you go and take some more calls?
Yeah, I went to YaoiCon Bingo for the hell of it.
I didn't win anything, but... YaoiCon Bingo...
Yes.
This sounds like one of those things I have to experience at least once in my life.
I've heard of YaoiCon for probably 10 years now, and I've never really gone.
You probably should.
I've been to YaoiCon before, Rob.
It's interesting.
Maybe at some point.
Yeah, I might go to YaoiCon this year, but only for one day.
Same with SakAnime's summer version.
Okay.
Well, maybe with SakAnime's in our neck of the woods, we haven't been there in forever.
We'll see.
All right.
We've got to let you go, though, so we can get some more calls.
But thank you so much, GS68.
I'm glad to hear you had a fun time at Faname, and we should be back next year.
Alright, see you next year then.
Later.
You know what I meant.
I know, but you opened the door for me.
You don't do that.
I did.
Hey, you got me back for the purple spaceship from earlier in the show, so there you go.
Oh, that was a good play.
I loved it.
That was a good play.
The chat room is telling me to hang up on you for that, so you better talk quick to save yourself.
What else is on your mind?
Two words.
Animate Boston.
All right.
How was Animate Boston?
Between.
and many more.
Penny Arcade Expo East Coast Version
I've been saying no, no, and no.
Because the convention center holds maybe between 10,000 to 15,000 people, and AB has hit anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000.
It has been jam-packed.
If they do it right, they may be able to pull it off.
If not, when you get there late Friday afternoon or Friday evening, don't be too surprised to see signs on the door that says, filled to capacity due to fire code.
Wow.
Rob D in chat clarifies they are estimating 20,000 people for PAX East.
They're insane.
And if that's the case, the Heinz might just be able to pull it off.
It's three floors.
It's not tremendously huge as like…
The Baltimore Convention Center, which can hold about 24,000 people.
I can see the Hinds maybe half that.
They'll probably spill into some neighboring facilities and some of the hotels that I imagine are right nearby there.
That's kind of what ASEN does.
They have the convention center, but they also spill into the nearby hotels.
So I'm sure PAX will do something like that if there's that much demand there.
Yeah, because there's two hotels attached to the Hinds, and there's two more hotels within walking distance.
Interesting.
Anything else on your mind tonight?
Or actually, I want to ask you real quick, what did you see at Anime Boston gaming-wise that you wanted to share with us?
DDR4th Mix Plus Machine.
Epic win.
I missed that one.
And I also discovered what the whole Nintendo booth was, and since you went to ASA, you probably saw it too.
Hmm.
You didn't see it?
No, what, the Nintendo booth?
Yeah, it was in the dealer's room.
They had a complete display for Fire Emblem.
Yes, they did.
They were selling the hell out of that new Fire Emblem game, yeah.
Yes, yes it was.
Indeed.
I keep forgetting that I thought that was the makers, I guess it was Nintendo publishing it, but I thought for some reason, I don't know, it didn't click in my mind.
I'm slow.
But yeah, I definitely saw that on the floor.
They were a very popular booth.
All right, well, Ranma, we're going to let you go to get in some more calls and then go wrap up the show.
So thanks so much for calling, okay?
Ain't no problem.
Take care, guys.
Later, bud.
Later.
All right, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype.
Orange Lounge Radio is the phone number to call.
We'll take a few more calls before we leave you guys tonight.
I just answered one and they hung up right away.
I think somebody is redialing so fast that they're not actually able to get through.
I think we got one call here, though.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is Ingo.
Hey, Ingo.
What's good?
I was wondering how to say that.
What's on your mind, Ingo?
Um, nothing really much.
Um, I was wondering, is it really worth 200 bucks to get a three?
I already have a PS3, but I was just wondering.
The golden rule of gaming we've said time and again here on Orange Launch Radio is a console is only as good as the games that are on it.
You have to really look at what's available on the Xbox 360 and you have to look, are these games that I can't get on the PlayStation 3?
Or are these games giving me an experience I can't get on the PlayStation 3?
And I'm phrasing it like that to you because you already own a PlayStation 3.
Most people are usually going the other way around where they already have the Xbox, they want to get the PlayStation 3, or...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But since you already have that, you're really going to have to look at the Xbox exclusive games.
Are you somebody that plays Halo?
Are you somebody that plays Mass Effect 1 and some of these other games that are exclusive on Xbox 360?
I'm having a total brain lapse right now.
What are some of the other games?
Gears of War.
Gears of War, DDR Universe.
Fable 2.
Are these games of interest to you?
I'll have to think about it for a little bit.
Just some exclusive.
Well, here's my question to you, and you should ask yourself the same thing.
If I were to drop $200 on Xbox 360, what would be the first game I'd play on it?
For me, it'd probably be Grand Theft Auto 4.
Well, there you go.
But see, Grand Theft Auto 4 is also a game that you can get on the PlayStation 3.
But, of course, Xbox 360 also has the multiplayer.
They have the multiplayer in the PS3 as well.
They have expansions.
That's pretty much it for right now.
The multiplayer on the PS3 sucks.
Are you happy with the PlayStation 3 or are you a little disgruntled with where they've gone with it and that's why you're thinking about maybe going to Xbox?
I'm really happy with my PS3, uh, because, uh, well, yeah, I, I don't know why, but, no, I really shouldn't, until, uh, Twitter went down, then, uh, but, hey, I got a 500 gig, uh, PS3 now, so.
Nice, a modded PS3.
And hey, maybe you can get one of those phones where you can stream your pornography to anywhere you want in the world over 3G.
No, I'm not one of those people.
Alright.
I'm trying to think of what else I want to ask you in regards to this.
Wait until after E3 and then they'll announce all their new games and you can see if there's anything that tickles your fancy.
That's a really good point as well.
With all these rumors of the motion control device and everything that Xbox is supposed to be coming out, maybe that's going to be your incentive.
There also might be a price drop or two.
Definitely don't buy anything until at least after noon tomorrow after the press conference.
If you can wait that long.
If you were to tell me that, Loki, and I really wanted an Xbox 360, I'd be like, no, I can't wait that long.
I want it now.
I'll pay the extra $100.
I don't care.
I want it now.
I mean, any of us that buy a console the first day it comes out, we all know the damn thing's going to drop.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Exactly.
Who was it that paid how much for an Xbox 360?
$700.
That's what I thought.
Thank you very much.
I also own five of them.
Thank you very much.
Case in point.
Sorry, Ingo.
Well, good luck to you.
I hope you are able to figure it out.
And let us know if you do end up buying the Xbox 360 and what you do play on it.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
Um, Loki, uh, you should check your friend requests on your PS3.
I haven't been on my PS3 in, well, I have been on my PS3, but not browsing games.
We've been streaming the porn.
Watching porn, exactly.
No, we've been streaming movies out of it, um, but yeah, I haven't been on PlayStation Network in a while.
BlackWolf would like to remind everybody that he is Loki's only friend.
Not anymore, BlackWolf.
Sorry.
Oh, you cheated on him.
I would cry if I were Bobby.
All right, Ingo, we're going to let you go to get a couple more calls and get out of here, but have a good night, okay?
You too.
Later, bud.
What was I going to say?
TheRobD in chat says, because motion on the three... Oh, actually, this is his call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
What's up guys, it's the Rob D I was just about to read one of your comments in chat Because motion on the 360 is going to be good Laugh What if it is, Rob
Um, then I'll gladly eat crow, but I really doubt it's actually going to be good.
You think it's going to be anything more than a gimmick?
It's a cup of mayonnaise tonight, Rob.
I don't know if you were here earlier in the night.
Honestly, there is going to be a motion controller, regardless of this camera thing, because the third-party game accessory developer PDP is putting out their magic wand controller thing.
It has a game that comes with it called Squeeballs.
And it looks like the Wii remote.
It's got, yeah...
As long as I can waggle my squeeballs, I'll be good.
Wow.
You know, there could be something good out of this.
I don't know.
You know, it might be a hell of a party thing.
I don't think it's something I'm going to sit there and play in the room by myself.
Look at me flailing about like an asshole.
Oh my god, can we get a Totem Ball sequel?
Can I buy another useless camera?
I somehow don't think Rob called in tonight to talk about Microsoft Motion Control.
Let me turn it over to Rob.
What's on your mind tonight?
I have to ask you guys to bear with me a little bit because I'm currently sick and I'm coughing all over the place.
I have no voice and I've been doing the show all night tonight, so it's fine.
Would you like your third convention report of the night since I went to Anime North in Toronto?
Apparently we are the convention hub on the internet.
I guess so.
We should just name ourselves the convention cast.
That's all right.
How was it?
It was fun.
Toronto was actually a really cool city.
It's the first time I've been there in about a decade.
Though they don't really care too much for copyright infringement, as you can see from the picture I just posted in chat, which is hilarious.
It was a great place to have a convention, even though it was a little bit outside the city, but I managed to have a friend show me around anyway.
Mario Bros.
Fast Foods
Do they serve Mario broth soup there or something?
What the hell?
I don't know.
You can actually see they're under renovation.
I would have totally eaten there, but I decided to eat this little concoction for lunch instead.
Something called poutine.
Oh, God, yes.
I've heard of this.
It's like the french fries and gravy, right?
French fries, cheese curds, and gravy.
If that doesn't stop your heart, I don't know what will.
But either way, the convention, though.
Instant pancreas attack right there if I eat that.
Sorry, convention, yes.
Yes.
Wow.
Video game related, the game room.
I know this is a theme with me lately, but the game room kind of sucked.
You know how you said it's great when the conventions actually spill over into the surrounding hotels?
It's not so great when that surrounding hotel is a half mile away.
Oh, yeah, that's not good.
That sounds very Anime Expo.
Which is why I quit going.
Yeah, I went over there for most of Saturday, and of course they ended up scrapping the Street Fighter IV tournament three hours after it was supposed to start, but I'm not bitter.
Not at all.
I went there in the morning, and all they had to play was Brawl, a pinball game on the PS2, I don't even know what it was, and SBC Chaos.
Oh, and Ikaruga, which is... I guess that's fine.
But the real highlight of the convention...
was me taking a picture with the voice of Link, Nobuyuki Hiyama, and the voice of Joe Higashi, the voice of Iroh, the voice of Siegfried from Soul Calibur.
They got some pretty good celebs up there in Canada, don't they?
I know, right?
Wow.
That was a ton of fun.
I'm looking at the picture right now.
There you are.
There he is.
Too bad it wasn't the voice of Navi.
Hey, listen.
Hey, listen.
I would love to get that person to do a bumper for OLR.
Hey, listen.
Hey, listen.
To OLR.
To OLR.
Sorry, I don't know what the hell possessed me for that.
So on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blow your mind awesome con of the year, like better than Penny Arcade Expo, 1 being, oh my god, this sucked, where would you rate this convention?
I'd rate it at about a solid 8.
I expect Otakon to be better, because last year at Otakon was just a really great experience, and especially since I have a panel at Otakon this year, it's going to be a ton of fun.
Of course, that makes everything better.
A Rob D panel makes everything better.
The only thing better than a Rob D panel?
A Rob Roberts panel.
Is a Sky panel?
That's right.
I'm just messing.
All right, Rob, we've got to let you go so we can go wrap up the show, but thank you for making our show now with more poutine.
I appreciate that.
You know it.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
You always need more French fries and cheese curds.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
See you later, man.
Bye.
All right.
We're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line tonight.
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're at about 920 in between this and our afterbirth and everything.
We don't want to be here too late tonight.
So we're going to go ahead and go around and wrap everything up.
Remember, if you guys didn't get through, we do need more emails always.
Put Jamie to work.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send it.
I'm not here to work.
ESRB is rated Final Fantasy 7 for the PS3 and PSP.
Basically the PlayStation Network version of it where you can download the PlayStation 1 game.
Most people's guess is that it's going to come out with the release of the Blu-ray of Final Fantasy Advent Children Complete, since that's when it came out in Japan, so in a few more weeks.
Another surprise Sony-related, apparently there was a Sony PlayStation Blog E3 2009 meetup in LA.
Well, apparently the first hundred people in line also got E3 passes, so lucky them.
Um...
Let's see here.
That is very lucky.
I would like to know if any of our listeners were one of those hundred people.
Remember, I'm looking for hugs at E3 if you are.
Halo 3 Forum Halo Reach Halo Reach
Yes, it is.
Ubisoft is bringing more game show based games to the Wii, including Press Your Luck, Family Feud, and they're going to do another Price is Right game.
Fuck no.
I'm just kidding.
I haven't played the Price is Right game.
It might be interesting.
by the way completely unrelated but I have to ask did anyone see that clip on the internet of the Price is Right episode from last week where this contestant got so excited she jumped up on Drew Carey and kneed him in the balls oh my god like it was an accident thing she didn't mean to do it but she totally kneed him in the balls and took him down like he was like oh my god I think it was on TMZ or something if you have to see it it's hilarious sorry completely random but fuck yes to press your luck
They have a Splinter Cell banner, of course, outside of the LA Convention Center, kind of confirming still that it's an Xbox 360 exclusive.
No big surprise there.
And some other homebrew stuff, actually, interesting.
There's a project someone's working on called Metroid 2.5.
It's going to be kind of a 2.5D version of Metroid 2 and kind of 3.
Oh, in other words, what Metroid on the GameCube should have been, in my opinion.
There's a lot of Prime fans that would disagree with me.
It's quite different than what you would think.
It's actually...
It's really weird, like he can kind of, like Super Paper Mario almost, but, like, you know, not Metroid, Mega Man, I'm sorry, Mega Man 2.5.
Oh, well, you just changed everything, alright, Mega Man.
Not Metroid.
No, there is still Metroid 2.5 type of game that's coming out that someone's making, that Metroid 2 fusion thing.
That looked interesting.
Um...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, the ROM leaked out.
I fucking told you this would happen.
I fucking said it that night that we covered this story.
It's going to leak anyway, and they're going to be like, oops, I didn't know.
Sorry, guys.
Didn't mean to.
We all knew it was going to come out anyway.
Originally, they thought, though, it was going to be the 98% finished version of it, but now it's an alpha version of it, so it's not
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm not surprised one bit that that came out.
And there's millions of people downloading it now, I'm sure.
I better include myself.
I know, I'm like, things to do when I get home.
And then finally, there's a new music game coming out from the founders of Rockstar Games.
Actually, founders of...
Yippee!
Alright!
We're getting out of here.
We're done for the night.
Are we?
We got to wrap up.
Yeah, we got to do our live-only segment real quick and then get out of here.
It's almost 10 o'clock on the West Coast, if you can believe it.
Long show tonight, but we had a lot of news.
What did you expect?
Really?
I mean, we've got E3 coming up.
Exactly.
Wait till next time.
And if we are here next Sunday, which I don't see why we wouldn't be, but we'll see.
We'll see.
Maybe like a short show Sunday.
That's what I'm thinking is going to happen.
Maybe we'll do – well, we'll talk because I know Bobby might want to go along because this is his 200th show.
We'll worry about it later.
I know we've got to do some type of E3 impression show.
We've got to.
And Dark Sakura, since you're not going, you've got to keep an eye on it from home.
I guess.
And keep an eye on all the blogs and all that fun stuff.
I guess.
All right.
Anyhow, let's see.
We're going to –
Wrap up and get on out of here.
Everybody's final thought tonight.
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
Your final thought.
I made my garage too big.
Loki, your final thought.
I have to play more Fuel and then kill some Sims.
My final thought is I got to check out this fuel as well.
And I'm looking forward to going to E3.
And remember, I'm looking for hugs and just to meet more people.
So if you do happen to see me out there at E3, please stop and say hello.
Post it.
I promise I'm not mean.
Just come up and say hi.
Introduce yourself.
Ask anyone who met me at ASEN or anything.
I swear I'm not mean.
But I am.
Yes, but Loki is.
So avoid him at all costs.
I am too.
But if I'm with Loki, then you're okay because I will keep him in check and he won't be mean to you.
In reality, actually, Loki's one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.
It's just a radio persona.
It's all a lie.
It's all a lie.
I'm absolutely mean.
I hate to break it to you guys here, but the mean guy persona is all a lie.
Great.
They're going to have Tony Hawk's ride at the Microsoft E3 keynote.
That's going to be boring to watch.
Hooray.
Maybe that's why they suddenly did the five-minute increase or whatever in time.
TheRobD in chat says, Sky punched me in the face and threw a drink at me.
in true diva fashion.
All right.
No, really, we're out of here.
