00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,360
Today, May 31, 2009, the PSP Go gets confirmed a bit early, Matrix Online decides to pull

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,760
the plug, and on the eve of the expo we go over all the E3 leaks and rumors.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,240
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Radio.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,600
We are that show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
lifestyle.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,820
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you every week.

8
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,040
Say hello as well to my co-host, the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,860
How are you doing?

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,000
At least you have a voice.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,720
My voice is leaving, I had a busy weekend.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,280
I should make you some coffee or some tea or something.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,640
Coffee would be awesome actually.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,080
Why don't I make some coffee?

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,080
That would be super.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,680
I will do that after I announce my gaming week.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,480
Yeah, I was going to say, we're trying to do a show right now, so maybe we'll get into

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
that in a little bit.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
I will, I will use my sensio.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Awesome.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Awesome.

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,040
I can't wait for hot coffee, fresh from DarkSakura.

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,280
On second thought, go get yourself.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,580
Also say hello to TechMasterLoki who has a thread on his shirt that's bugging the hell

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,580
out of me.

26
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,580
There it is.

27
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,080
Why did she do that?

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,080
Should I put it back?

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
No.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
I see.

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
How are you?

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
That's what wives are supposed to do.

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
How are you, TechMasterLoki?

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm doing fine.

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Yeah?

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
That's what I try to do.

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
Been busy.

38
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
I think your mic is off, Loki.

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I'm not.

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
That's right, I turned it off.

41
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
There you go.

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
I forgot that I did that too.

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Oh, well, welcome back.

44
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,840
Apparently you're gone one week and you forget how the damn show works.

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Yes.

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Just kidding.

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
All right, so how are you doing, Loki?

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,400
I've been busy.

49
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Yes, been busy?

50
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Getting ready for E3?

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Uh, no.

52
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
No.

53
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Me neither.

54
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,120
I am so not ready for E3, which is actually why I'm kind of excited that I don't have

55
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,440
a lot of commitments.

56
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,800
The great thing about you and I, and unfortunately Dark Soccer can't go this year, but hopefully

57
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
next year she can go again.

58
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,240
The great thing about us going to E3 is that we don't answer to nobody.

59
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
We only answer to you guys, the listeners, really direct what we do.

60
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,200
And we don't answer to them either.

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,160
Sometimes we decide not to listen to them either.

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
No, I'm kidding.

63
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm kidding.

64
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,760
But I mean, if we're going to let anybody boss us around, it's the listeners.

65
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,980
You know what I mean?

66
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,880
We don't have anybody to, you know, nobody pays us to cover or write or edit video or

67
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
any of that stuff.

68
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
And why not?

69
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
We just kind of get to do whatever.

70
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Someone should pay us.

71
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Well, but if they did, then we'd have that responsibility.

72
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,120
And I kind of like the fact that we're going to E3 as gamers to just soak it all in, see

73
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,680
what interests us outside of all the media hype.

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,320
Maybe we're going to find something in a dark corner somewhere that gets half a page

75
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,000
right up on sites that are way overlooked and all the PSP Go and whatever other news

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
is going to come out of E3.

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
And you know, we can focus on that.

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,880
And that's going to be the cool thing about E3, I think this year.

79
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,080
Because right now, I have to admit you guys, E3 this year, I'm not feeling it as much as

80
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
I have in years past.

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,760
And I know there's a lot of people that are like, you effing bastard.

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
You know, I have always wanted to go to E3.

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,720
And you're sitting there going, well, I'm going to E3, but I don't feel kind of half

84
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,000
asked about it this year.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,900
From my perspective, in my defense a little bit, you know, this used to be a big deal.

86
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,480
Like everybody I knew, knew went to E3.

87
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,740
And this year, like not even, I think it's the economy plays a big part in it.

88
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,960
Not even Dark Soccer is going.

89
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,140
One of our own hosts here on the show is not able to go to the show.

90
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,660
And like, you know, it's a choice not to go to the show, right?

91
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,680
And none of my friends, you know, outside of the three of us are really going except

92
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,480
for some of my long distance friends like Bobby and, you know, Kropotkin and some of

93
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,280
the, you know, All Games people are going to be there.

94
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,960
But I'm talking about, you know, some of my local friends, there used to be like 10 of

95
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,640
us that would go and none of them are going.

96
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,960
So it's kind of weird this year.

97
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm going to feel a little lonely at E3.

98
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,520
So if you happen to be going to E3, I might need a hug because I'm feeling a little lonely

99
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
this year.

100
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
All right, everyone.

101
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Yay.

102
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,160
And you know how we used to have the kick in UltraCade?

103
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
This is a hug-a-rob.

104
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,400
So everyone go around, hug Rob, post your pictures to pixx.com.

105
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,360
And just remind me that I don't have to be alone.

106
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,760
Give Rob some love before he cries like an emo child.

107
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,440
I don't know why I'm feeling weird about E3 this year, but I know, you know what, it's

108
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
going to be the same as every year.

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm going to get to LA and I'm going to have a blast.

110
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,840
You know, because this, you guys have to understand, you know, I'm a normal gamer person just like

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
the rest of you.

112
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Don't get paid to do this stuff.

113
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
I don't understand, Rob.

114
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,600
It's just, it's one of those things where I do this all the time with trips.

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,800
Even right before I went to ASEN, Chicago, I was like dragging my feet.

116
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
Like, why the hell did I sign up to do this?

117
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
Why am I going to Chicago?

118
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,520
Oh my God.

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,080
Like I'm just, this is just getting in the way right now.

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,160
I don't have, and then once the plane landed, I was like, woo, I'm in another city.

121
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
I'm having fun.

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
You know, I'm meeting so many new people.

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
But what?

124
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,840
You have lesbians to hang out with.

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,600
I know, and I got to see the lesbians there, but the lesbians aren't going to E3.

126
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,720
How is E3 supposed to be any fun without lesbians?

127
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Hopefully there's some lesbians at E3 somewhere.

128
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Every convention needs more gay.

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,840
I need a hug from lesbians at E3.

130
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
That's what I need.

131
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,120
Every convention is better with more gay.

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,320
Enough of my whining.

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
Let me introduce the chat room as well.

134
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,440
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

135
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,800
And look, I got a hug from Retertainment already in chat.

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
A nice virtual hug.

137
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,880
Well, thank you guys very much.

138
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,040
And from Milma13120 as well.

139
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,120
So hooray for hugs and hooray for new people.

140
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,160
I see a lot of people in the chat that I have not seen before, so I think we have some new

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
listeners.

142
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,520
I think CyberBeast41 I think was saying he's in Belgium and listening for the first time.

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,680
So welcome.

144
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
I like Belgium.

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,000
I've never been there, but I like it.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,720
We like having, I like the fries.

147
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,480
We like having new, and waffles, I'm just kidding, but we like having new listeners.

148
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,980
It's pretty cool.

149
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,980
And new people in chat.

150
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,760
And I think maybe part of that has to do with the podcast feed being so far behind.

151
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,620
And God, I hate that it's become habit here at OLR, but I swear there's a good reason

152
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,560
for it and I will get to it in just a moment.

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,160
But I do want to get into how we always start off the show.

154
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
How was your gaming week?

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
DarkSoccer, how was your gaming week?

156
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,600
My gaming week was pretty much The Sims, as I'm doing right now.

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Awesome.

158
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:26,280
And actually, I did do some looking into Sims 3, so I'm very, very much looking forward

159
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,160
to getting my hands on that.

160
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,640
And you know, we do have to remember, there might be some people out there going, oh my

161
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,960
gosh, The Sims, but The Sims is like the best selling PC game ever.

162
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,240
So you know, we do have to remember that there is a huge audience for these games.

163
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
And a lot of anticipation.

164
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,800
I don't know about your neck of the woods, folks, but I was seeing a bunch of billboards

165
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,580
in the Bay Area this weekend for Sims 3.

166
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,160
They have this whole Let There Be Sims campaign going on.

167
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,360
So this is setting up to be a big event, and it's all next week, same time as E3.

168
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,920
I'll be honest, I actually, you know, the biggest thing that I like to do, and I quit

169
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,160
playing it because that was all I was doing for a while, it's pretty much the thing that

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,120
I like to do is make houses.

171
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,540
I love designing shit.

172
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,480
I love designing shit.

173
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,840
I mean, I guess maybe that's why I'm in school for it, maybe?

174
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,220
But the most fun for me has really been, you know, getting these bizarro little houses

175
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
and putting them together.

176
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,400
I've been greatly, greatly enjoying it.

177
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,080
You know, I can sympathize, DarkSakura, because that's why I love Quake Live, because I love

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,120
shooting people in the face.

179
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
And that's what I'm trying to-

180
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I love shooting people in the face, too!

181
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,400
That's what I'm trying to study in school, is shooting people in the face.

182
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
But they don't-

183
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
What a coincidence!

184
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
I had to make my own major for that.

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,600
That's part of, that's actually part of a designer's job, is shooting their clients

186
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,440
in the face when they're belligerent.

187
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I'm sorry, I'm kidding.

188
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
That won't get me any clients, will it?

189
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Obviously, I'm just teasing DarkSakura.

190
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,840
That was a little parody there.

191
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,280
I was parodying your parody.

192
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,320
I was parodizing your parody.

193
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,360
I consider my parody parodied.

194
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,280
Yeah, I'm gonna get your coffee now.

195
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Alright, yay!

196
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,600
Good, because I don't want you to hear about my gaming week.

197
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Loki, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

198
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I only played really two different things.

199
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,920
First being the modified version of Grand Theft Auto IV.

200
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,640
We're still tweaking it to get it just right, but now we have flying police cars, super

201
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,720
ambulances, guns that shoot fire, guns that shoot explosions, guns that shoot blasts of

202
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
air that launch people into the air.

203
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,880
So it's been a lot of fun.

204
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm actually looking forward to one of the stories we're gonna get into later where they're

205
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,520
actually gonna have the expansions on their own disc, because then I can actually edit

206
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,840
everything in Lost and Damned and the new expansions, so that'll be cool.

207
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,320
And then today I decided to play my copy of Fuel that I got a little early, and that's

208
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
actually really fun.

209
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,600
And when they tell you that it has 1,800 square kilometers in the game, it does, and it feels

210
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
like it.

211
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
And it actually breaks it down to 19 different zones in the game.

212
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,960
The one you start off in, when you look at the map it doesn't look that big, but then

213
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,800
when you actually try driving in it, it's huge.

214
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,120
And one of the achievements is actually driving from the first outpost that you get to the

215
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,560
next outpost you unlock.

216
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,320
And it took me a good 30 minutes to drive that.

217
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,560
And I'm talking the most direct route I could possibly take, not on roads, just going straight

218
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
towards the next outpost, over mountains, everything.

219
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,960
It's just insane, the size of the game.

220
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,600
And what's even better, though, is the fact that you don't really have to do the races,

221
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,120
because there's actually, the currency in the game is fuel, and there's these oil barrels

222
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,680
that you'll find that you just run into them and you get more fuel to buy new cars.

223
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,880
But it's an awesome game, and it's going to be really fun online.

224
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,560
So if you're a fan of racing games, especially like Motorstorm, definitely going to be a

225
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
game for you.

226
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,040
Now, here's the burning question I have about this game, fuel.

227
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,240
Because they talk about, you know, that there's all this vast amount of land, that it's like

228
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,480
huge, you know, all this area that you can drive.

229
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,400
But is it interesting backdrop drop, or is it desert bus thrilling?

230
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I mean...

231
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,000
No, it's very, there's a lot of variety in the terrain.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,120
I mean, a lot of variety.

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,680
I mean, you'll get up on top of a mountain, you'll look, and you can see mountains way

234
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,560
in the distance, and you can actually drive there.

235
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
I mean...

236
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,320
So it's kind of like Oblivion, but for driving.

237
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,240
Because that's the feel I get from Oblivion, is like, Oblivion is effing huge.

238
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,520
You will never see everything in that game unless you are a sick, sad person.

239
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
You know what I mean?

240
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,200
This seriously, okay, I got tired from driving.

241
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,120
Like, it took me so long to get to the next destination, I got like driver's syndrome

242
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
or whatever, you know.

243
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I felt tired.

244
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,360
In fact, that's actually when I turned the game off, because I'd been playing for a few

245
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
hours.

246
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,400
But it's actually really fun.

247
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,660
There's a lot of variety, there's a lot of events that you can do, or you can just drive

248
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
around.

249
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,000
You can make your own events and challenge people online with them.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,920
You can, there's a bunch of different, you know, environments, day night cycles, different

251
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,240
weather effects that you have.

252
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Lots of forests.

253
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,360
I mean, like, I was driving through forests, and then driving across farmland, and then

254
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
I got to the desert.

255
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,360
I mean, it literally, there's a ton of stuff.

256
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,640
And I mean, it has some stuff that, I guess it's supposed to be similar to the United

257
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
States.

258
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,880
Obviously the map's not set up like the United States, but it's got parts that like, okay,

259
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,440
maybe this is supposed to be Seattle, maybe this is like, you know, Nevada or something

260
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,140
like that.

261
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,420
But it's actually pretty sweet, so, um, you know, really gonna be holding my attention

262
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,460
for a while, at least as far as racing games go.

263
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,600
And it's an arcade style racer, so you'd probably like it.

264
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,680
I was gonna say, this, you know what, I was kind of feeling like, okay, I'm kind of looking

265
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,360
a little apprehensive about this game.

266
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,920
But now I'm hearing you describe it, I'm like, wow, I like want this game right now.

267
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
It's fun, yeah.

268
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,800
How does, what would you compare the controls to?

269
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,680
What's the closest game you can think of that this controls to?

270
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Is it like F-Zero, or is it Forza?

271
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
You know, how, what are the controls?

272
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,660
Probably just like Motorstorm, I mean, there's no nitrous in it, but it's very simple.

273
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,360
It's like, you know, right trigger for accelerator, left trigger for brake, and then X for hand

274
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
brake.

275
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
That's it.

276
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm, I'm very curious about this.

277
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
You, you definitely piqued my interest.

278
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,800
Um, actdeft in our chatroom at chat.orangetonstrader.com says, it's made by Codemasters, and they make

279
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
pretty damn awesome driving games.

280
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Yeah, like, Dirt was a really, that was Codemasters, right?

281
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
That was Codemasters, yeah.

282
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,720
That was a really interesting game to look at, but I couldn't control it for crap.

283
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,440
See, this is the other thing, it, the graphics in it aren't, like, they're good, but they're

284
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,600
not like, you know, the level of polish that you see in, like, Dirt 2's trailers and stuff

285
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,700
like that.

286
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,340
But I mean, it makes sense, because they have this huge landscape that they have to pop

287
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
you with everything.

288
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,880
And there's actually stuff around, you'll see, um, you know, I've ran over a dead, uh,

289
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,480
horse skeleton, I ran, um, there's, like, all these barns and farmland and stuff like

290
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,440
that, and you can, all of them have, like, ramps on them, so you can jump those.

291
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Um, I don't know, there's, like, different events.

292
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,720
They have one that's, like, chase the copter, and you basically have to just try to navigate

293
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,280
your way to a helicopter, and, although I haven't seen it yet, there's tornadoes, so

294
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,720
you have to race through tornadoes.

295
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,760
That's awesome.

296
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,520
This could be, you know, I haven't heard a lot about this game, so maybe this is, like,

297
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
gonna be a sleeper hit.

298
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
I don't know.

299
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
It's been getting OK reviews.

300
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
I mean, it's fun.

301
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,600
Where are people critical of the game, and do you agree?

302
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
I haven't read the reviews yet, but I just saw the number of reviews, and they're, like,

303
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,160
getting mid eights, low, mid sevens, low eights, you know.

304
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,600
But I mean, it's just a number.

305
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,800
It's really, I've been looking forward to this game ever since they announced it, and

306
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,880
I think it's worth it.

307
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,160
It's gonna be very fun, and, you know, the fact that they have online, you can do online

308
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,120
free mode, so basically you're just driving with your friends.

309
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,840
Well, that was kind of test drive, wasn't it?

310
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
It was very similar to that.

311
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Test drive sucked.

312
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
I mean...

313
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I thought it was OK.

314
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
OK, test drive was awful.

315
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,920
I mean, like, the landscape was very plain, and the police couldn't chase after you off

316
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
the road.

317
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,200
It was just...

318
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I don't know.

319
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,320
But, yeah, it's gonna be a good game.

320
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,960
Comes out next week.

321
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Definitely worth picking it up.

322
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,680
Redertainment in our chat room asks, racing tornadoes, is Helen Hunt involved in this

323
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
game?

324
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
I don't know.

325
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
People have been looking for tornadoes.

326
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,800
I mean, they haven't...

327
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,240
I haven't found one yet.

328
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
I've just...

329
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,240
The only kind of weather that I've driven through, and maybe just because I'm only in

330
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,240
the one section of the map, although, I mean, the other sections of the maps are locked,

331
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
but not necessarily...

332
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,420
I mean, you can drive through them and stuff, but none of the events appear until you've

333
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,480
unlocked, you know, so many races and stuff, but, I mean, free mode, you can drive across

334
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,280
the whole thing, and I would be willing to bet it'd take a few hours to get from one

335
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
side of the map to the other.

336
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
I mean, it's huge.

337
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Wow.

338
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,520
It's like walking in oblivion would take about that long, right?

339
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,680
Yeah, well, and then they do have helipads.

340
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,880
You can fly to different things, but, you know, for that achievement that I wanted to

341
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,640
get, it was drive from one without the use of helicopter, you know, it's like, wow, this

342
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
is long.

343
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
All right, all right.

344
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Well, it sounds interesting.

345
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
I'll have to check that out.

346
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
When's this game released?

347
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Probably on the 3rd, I believe.

348
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Check it out.

349
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
That's Fuel.

350
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
Xbox 360 and PS3?

351
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Yep.

352
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
All right.

353
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
My Gaming Week.

354
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Okay.

355
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,760
My Gaming Week's been interesting.

356
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
There's really only been one...

357
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,080
I haven't had a lot of time to play games because I've been out of town this week, but

358
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,000
I decided to try something different this week, and, you know, if you were listening

359
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,680
to the show last week, you heard that I've been kind of disillusioned with a lot of stuff

360
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,920
that's been going on in Warcraft lately.

361
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,000
I think I've just kind of hit my saturation point with the game itself, like, I just need

362
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,080
a break at the expansion, even though they have the new dungeon, the old war and all

363
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,880
that stuff, I'm just not feeling it.

364
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,200
I needed a break from WoW.

365
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,960
So I got a great idea for something I could do, actually, as an article for Orangelaundrator.com,

366
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,100
and what I'm doing is an article about what I have missed in two and a half years in Final

367
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,360
Fantasy XI, and I reactivated my account this week on Final Fantasy XI.

368
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Oh, my God.

369
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,040
I had to come right back in the room to hear Rob say something that I was dreading.

370
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,280
Now, something you should know, I have not told anybody this, not a single, no, one person

371
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,160
I told this because of another conversation we were having, one person knew until now,

372
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
now like what?

373
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,040
However many people are listening, no.

374
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,300
So it's kind of something I was keeping a little bit under wraps because it was something,

375
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,360
you know, I wanted to kind of see what I've been missing and what I could pick up on.

376
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,000
And I'll tell you what, damn, there is a lot that has changed.

377
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,720
It was really hard for me to kind of get back into it.

378
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,120
But I will say this, one thing I've noticed, and I'll write a full because I'm nowhere

379
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,680
near ready enough to write something full for the website yet, and believe me, there

380
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,720
will be a long article coming on the website later.

381
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,480
I will notice this, one of the first things I noticed right away, they have made it way

382
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,280
easier to solo in that game.

383
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,480
Like there is so much more you can do in the first like 15 levels than you could before.

384
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,640
Is that worth it for me to go back and play?

385
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,200
I might, I am honestly gonna say, if you quit this game because grouping was too much for

386
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,040
you, there might be more in this game for you now.

387
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,480
That between these- Well that was the big thing is I hated being

388
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
the party bitch.

389
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,920
With the addition of the field manuals and this stuff where you can kind of get experience

390
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,500
for WoW style questing, and the fact that now Easy Prey monsters are a lot easier to

391
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,600
kill and give you like 60 experience, whereas before they would give you like 15, you know,

392
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,280
there seems to be a lot more you can do soloing.

393
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,520
Like I got from level 9 to level 12 in a couple hours of play, whereas before, like, man you'd

394
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,000
have to go to the dunes or you'd have to be soloing, it was a lot harder before.

395
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,880
So it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.

396
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,080
I don't know how long I'm gonna stick with it, I don't know.

397
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,160
You know a big reason I stuck with WoW as long as I did is the people, and in Final

398
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,140
Fantasy XI right now, there is no people, I know one person that's playing, and I have

399
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,360
yet to run into them in the game, so I don't know.

400
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,680
I don't know how it's gonna go, but I wanted to really see, because part of the reason

401
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,840
I did this is because I have been so critical of Final Fantasy XI on the show and I've kind

402
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,440
of joked with listeners that I do feel I owe it to give the educated opinion if I'm gonna

403
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,680
knock on the game to see what I've missed in two and a half years, because every single

404
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,040
person I talk to that still plays the game says, Rob, it has changed.

405
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,760
Level syncing revolutionized the game, you need to go back.

406
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,600
So I went back, so we'll see what happens.

407
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,680
So I'm giving it a month, if I like it I'll stay, if I don't, I'll go back to WoW because

408
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,520
I'll probably miss it in about a month's time.

409
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,860
But honestly, with E3 this week and everything else, I don't expect to see the story on orangeonjurator.com

410
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,040
for about two weeks, because this next week I'm not gonna be in, so it won't be for like

411
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
two weeks.

412
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,240
In case of irony, I'm actually gonna go to Sony online, they're gonna give me a walkthrough

413
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,720
of all their MMOs, which is great because I don't have time to play any of them, so

414
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,720
you know, but man, I wanna check out APB when that's there, because that's gonna be there.

415
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,340
I hope Star Trek Online makes an appearance, we'll see.

416
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,140
To quote GS68 in the chatroom, it says, an e-drinking game rule, every time Sky talks

417
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,720
about MMOs, chug until he stops talking about them, and I told him not to do that because

418
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
of die of liver failure.

419
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,840
I know, it seems like all I ever talk about is MMOs, well I needed something, you know,

420
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,400
just Warcraft just kinda, you know, I needed a break, which is sad because I had a break,

421
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
not that long ago, but you know, it is what it is.

422
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,000
If games aren't fun, I don't play them, so I decided to try to have fun somewhere else,

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
so we'll see.

424
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,120
Anyhow, more to come on that in future weeks.

425
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,360
That was pretty much it for my gaming week.

426
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,920
I played some Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but it's all stuff I've talked about before.

427
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm sure you all were gonna get a kick out of that one anyway.

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,600
Oh, and the show wasn't uploaded because his drive failed.

429
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes, actually, which I was gonna get into on housekeeping, thank you.

430
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,480
Sorry, I thought you were doing housekeeping.

431
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,440
No, it had nothing to do with Final Fantasy XI keeping me from uploading the show or anything.

432
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,920
We have a storage drive, since we moved into Studio Dark Soccer, we have a storage drive

433
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,540
that, well wouldn't you know it, the storage drive failed this week and will not read anymore,

434
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,780
so everything we have on that drive is lost.

435
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,280
Now the good news is, everything is saved to this local computer in the studio anyway,

436
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,680
so it's not like we lost the files completely, but at least I hope, I didn't check, but I

437
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,040
don't think there would be a reason.

438
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,720
I'm pretty sure we always would copy them over.

439
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,480
So we should be caught up on the podcast sometime this week.

440
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,160
It's gonna be very tough with E3 and everything going on, but I want to get at least last

441
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,040
week's show up, like tomorrow before I leave, you know, and we'll slowly get caught up.

442
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,880
But that's the reason why the podcast feed is behind and we are really, really sorry,

443
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,640
but these things happen.

444
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Technical difficulties.

445
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,560
I wasn't here last week because I was laying floor, which I just finished today.

446
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,200
It took forever.

447
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
But it looks nice.

448
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,880
Rama in chat says, Sky, it's not lost, I can tell you how to retrieve it.

449
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,080
Don't worry, we have a backup copy here on this computer, it's not gonna need anything

450
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,800
fancy or what have you, especially if somebody's been bootlegging the show now, which I heard

451
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,920
has been happening, just in case a future loss, we're fine.

452
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,160
We should have everything on this computer.

453
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,200
Stay tuned to our Twitter for more updates.

454
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,800
And by the way, if you're not on the Twitter for OLR, please get on there, twitter.com

455
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,080
slash OLR, because I'm telling you what, the Twitter users are going to be controlling

456
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,800
E3 for Orange Lounge Radio.

457
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,040
We are going to be tweeting from the show floor, what do you want us to look at?

458
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,480
What do you want pictures of?

459
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,160
What do you want us to ask?

460
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,440
What games are you not hearing enough about on the main sites, you know, because you know

461
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,760
everybody's gonna be talking about PSP Go and whatever Microsoft says, and if Nintendo

462
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,240
throws out a new Mario game, they're gonna be talking about that.

463
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,840
And that there's gonna be so many games that are overlooked.

464
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,880
That's what we're focusing on E3 this year, the stuff that everyone else overlooks.

465
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,600
We have to find the Korean porn games.

466
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,000
We will be looking for the Korean porn games, you betcha.

467
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I hope they're there.

468
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,360
I hope the loss of Kensha Hall did not make us lose the porn games.

469
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,880
I love Kensha Hall.

470
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,440
I know, I'm very sad to see it's gone, but it looks like they have a lot of those developers

471
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,760
in West Hall on the side.

472
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
So we'll see, I'm thinking they just did some clever rearranging of things, and there are

473
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,920
a few people that aren't there this year.

474
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,000
You know, we don't have Atari this year, which by the way, Loki reminded me, there won't

475
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,600
be Star Trek Online, because Atari's not there.

476
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
But, you know, there's some other companies that aren't there, so we'll see what happens.

477
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,080
They're normally in the closet anyways over there.

478
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,200
Remember last time, you know.

479
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,960
Oh, Atari, you're only one of the big innovators of the...

480
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Stupid douchebag.

481
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,320
Who was that douchebag with the, like, skateboard with carpet on it, with the PSP inside the

482
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
skateboard?

483
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Nah.

484
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
Oh, yeah.

485
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Oh, God.

486
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I hate that guy.

487
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Yeah, I remember that guy.

488
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Anyway, I will be at the show Tuesday, Wednesday.

489
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,320
Loki will be at the show Wednesday, Thursday.

490
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,840
So between the two of us, we'll have the show covered all three days.

491
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,240
We're going, at least I think I am going to a party Wednesday night.

492
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm hearing all these people talk about, oh, I got invited to seven parties and all that.

493
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,520
I think we're going to a party Wednesday night for Games for Windows, and thank you very

494
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,680
much for passing along the invite for that.

495
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,400
We're going to check it out, see what that's all about.

496
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
PC games.

497
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,900
I know that's something Dark Soccer is into, obviously, so I think for her, we need to

498
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,000
check out what Games for Windows is all about and see what they're going to be announcing

499
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
there.

500
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Find out what doesn't suck.

501
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Definitely.

502
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
All right.

503
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,720
So what does suck, we got so much news this week to get to, we're already 20 minutes into

504
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,560
the show and then some, let's get into the gaming news this week.

505
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,240
Loki, start us off.

506
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Yes.

507
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,720
So the rumor is that, you know, the PlayStation Slim, or PlayStation 3's, Slimmer model, whatever

508
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,920
they're going to call it, is supposed to be coming out August or September, according

509
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,720
to the Ars Technica Mole.

510
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Now, why should we believe this?

511
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,520
Well, because they were the one that talked about PSP Go, and, well, we'll be getting

512
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,000
into that later, but I think you all know that that was true, and there's actually box

513
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,040
shots that were leaked also of the PSP Go, which looked very similar to the PS3, so it

514
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
probably will be true.

515
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,120
I mean, you pretty much guessed that most of the stuff that's rumored and being hammered

516
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,920
in that it's going to happen is probably going to be true, and a lot of the stuff won't come

517
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
as a surprise.

518
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,360
What's interesting, though, there's a lot of people that say the PS3 Slim is still BS,

519
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,960
and I was listening to Bobby, who's on Right Before Us on All Games Radio, and he was talking

520
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,960
about how they don't, his hardware expert folks that help him do Friday night gaming,

521
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,840
don't think that it could fit, that there's so much that goes with Blu-ray that you can't

522
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,760
slim it down that much more, unless there, now my thought is maybe there's a technology

523
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,040
we're unaware of yet, I don't know, but, you know.

524
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,200
I think that it's going to happen.

525
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,880
I mean, we're going to find out about it tomorrow, or not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.

526
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,640
I don't think, well, I don't think we're actually going to find out about it tomorrow, I think

527
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,180
there's a good argument being made that they want to keep this thing under wraps, notice

528
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:38,440
how this got cease and desisted, whereas nothing else that's been leaked from Sony, including

529
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,360
things we're going to get into later and so on, that a lot of you probably heard about,

530
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,240
have been, or have not been cease and desisted, but Sony's kind of confirmed that.

531
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,960
The reason why, and, you know, because it's all going to be revealed Wednesday anyway,

532
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
it's all about hype, right?

533
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,240
Well, yes, but this hasn't been, this was probably going to be a big surprise or something,

534
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,080
but the other PSP Go stuff, that's already been released by Sony.

535
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,280
I mean, it's, you know, their online magazine or whatever that's releasing the information

536
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
about it.

537
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,320
If the PS3 comes out, if this PS3 slim comes out, or they come out Wednesday and say the

538
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,200
PlayStation 3 is going to be getting a slim model in a few months, sales of the PlayStation

539
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,720
3 will stop, because everybody is going, it will come to a standstill, because everybody's

540
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,960
going to be waiting for this new system.

541
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,080
No it won't, and you know why?

542
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,040
It's because the same reason why there's a new skew of the PlayStation 3 every time.

543
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,540
They don't stop sales, and if anything, what they'll do is a price drop on the current

544
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,000
system, they'll drop it down to clear out inventory, and then you'll have the new system

545
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,200
coming out at this, you know, normal price.

546
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,440
They've done the same pattern every time.

547
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,960
You know, it was $4.99, or before it was $5.99 and $4.99, and then they would drop the system

548
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,560
that was $5.99 down to $4.99 and clear it out, and then the new system would come out

549
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
at $5.99.

550
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,200
Well, now that they've dropped it to $100 again, it's $4.99 and $3.99, same type of

551
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
thing is going to happen.

552
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,360
These are going to drop down to maybe $50, and they're going to clear them out, or they

553
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,520
may even just keep offering it on the side and just have this one skew or whatever later

554
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,800
on towards the holidays.

555
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,040
But they're just going to, you know, drop the price of it a little bit until the, you

556
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,320
know, systems clear out, and then they're going to have the new one.

557
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,920
All right, well, we'll see.

558
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,480
I mean, there's a lot to be seen out of the press conference, and I think this is one

559
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,120
of the will they or won't they items.

560
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,520
But one interesting thing, I don't know if it's going to be covered tomorrow at the whole

561
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,800
press conference, but apparently Africa is finally getting some type of U.S. release.

562
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
That's right.

563
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,640
I mean, apparently Africa is finally going to be coming to the U.S., but they changed

564
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,000
the spelling back.

565
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
It's actually going to be Africa with a C now.

566
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,040
It's not going to be with a K. Apparently it was a big part of it.

567
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Rob.

568
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
How can they do that to us?

569
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
It's not Africa.

570
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
It's Africa.

571
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Oh, sorry.

572
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
Africa.

573
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,880
But apparently with less K and more C. I don't know.

574
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,120
Was it offensive or something?

575
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,020
I don't know why, but yeah.

576
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,480
They are deciding to change the name back to Africa with a C. But it is finally coming

577
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,560
out for the PlayStation 3, so if you were importing it, you don't really have to do

578
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
that anymore.

579
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
I want to hunt animals.

580
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Can we hunt animals?

581
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
No.

582
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Dang it.

583
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Why, I am not buying as well.

584
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,980
Yeah, there's still that Jambo Safari remake we talked about last week to look forward

585
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,980
to much more.

586
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,320
You missed that, by the way, Loki.

587
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,560
The Jambo Safari announcement, I'm sure you read about it, but you know, we were very

588
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,840
excited about that last week.

589
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
That totally excites me.

590
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,880
Now if you want a game like Africa where you can run over the animals, you need to buy

591
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Far Cry 2.

592
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,400
That's basically Africa with running over animals.

593
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,680
Although you have malaria, that's not fun either.

594
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,480
Real quick before we get to the next story, Tiger Claw says, that's a damn shame.

595
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,120
I kind of like the other title, Hakuna Matata.

596
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,880
It is kind of a cute title, but I bet Disney would glare if that happened here in the US.

597
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,360
That game actually came out with release.

598
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,880
I mean, it's not like they own the rights to that phrase, but you know, come on.

599
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,280
Whenever you hear Hakuna Matata, you can't help but think of Hakuna Matata.

600
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,680
Well now they're going to try to trademark the word up, so you know.

601
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,360
They've already got one of the directions, I mean, why not?

602
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,040
Hopefully they don't trademark Orange Launch Radio or we're going to be in trouble.

603
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
I don't know.

604
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
We'll see.

605
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,080
We need to hurry up and you know, actually get some sort of trade.

606
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Patent pending.

607
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Yeah, patent pending.

608
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,880
Actually, did you know, if you search the internet for, well obviously there's the band

609
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,840
act that we do take our namesake from in Japan, although that's a Japanese artist, not an

610
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,400
American artist.

611
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,400
There's some place, like some building or something.

612
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,720
There's actually like a music thing called the Orange Lounge where I guess they have

613
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,680
these musical acts come perform.

614
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,280
I think it's in Southern California too.

615
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,000
I think it's some type of gallery or whatever.

616
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,800
I found out when doing a search one night, you know, randomly just like, what else is

617
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
named Orange Lounge out there?

618
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
How big are we on the internet?

619
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,040
It's, well, it's interesting because you would think they would have really not liked the

620
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,960
fact that there's an Orange Lounge radio out there because we're both music oriented in

621
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
a way.

622
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
But here's the catch.

623
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,080
We've been around since 2001.

624
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
They haven't.

625
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,000
So if they did say anything, we'd be able to say, uh, we were first.

626
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You change your name.

627
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
No, you.

628
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But I mean, you know, it would be interesting to see what happens.

629
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Anyhow, enough of that.

630
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Let's move on with the gaming news.

631
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,760
Well, we have some very interesting stuff.

632
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,960
And actually it's a confirmation for something that, uh, Loki brought up is that Sony did

633
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:34,100
accidentally let stuff out on the PSP go, which, you know what, honestly, I think sometimes

634
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,680
this accidental stuff is half on purpose.

635
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Accidental my ass.

636
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,160
They throw it out enough for it to catch on and then say, oh no, cease and desist, get

637
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
this crap off of here.

638
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,340
You know, just tease, tease, tease, tease, tease.

639
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:53,760
It's enough for the fanboys to get aroused by it, but not enough for the big sites, the

640
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,040
AP, CNN, and all these to report on it just yet.

641
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,480
It's bait.

642
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,440
It's exactly, it's bait because it's basically generating buzz for this now so that you want

643
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,920
to hear, you know, what's going to happen at the press conference and you all tuned

644
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,120
into that to find out their other announcements.

645
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,680
It's bait is what it is.

646
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,800
I'll tell us a little more about it.

647
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Dark saga.

648
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:25,840
On Sony's core gaming show that they do, they posted the episode and then pulled it because

649
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,600
they had talked about the PSP go on there.

650
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,800
It has 16 gigabyte flash memory and Bluetooth support for mobile phone tethering.

651
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,640
That's pretty cool.

652
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:42,820
And also it mentioned Gran Turismo, LittleBigPlanet, Jak and Daxter, and Metal Gear Games.

653
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:50,280
So there actually are some photos of it out and about, and I'm trying to pull those up

654
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
right now.

655
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Well, that's very interesting.

656
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,160
I didn't, I didn't catch the part about the mobile phone tethering, but isn't that interesting

657
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,080
because we've heard reports that the new Apple firmware is supposed to support the whole

658
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
tethering thing.

659
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,640
You're gonna have to pay more money, but I wonder, it's a very interesting time kind

660
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
of thing.

661
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
I think the Bluetooth is there for the mobile phone tethering.

662
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,440
Yeah, just looking at this.

663
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,400
I think it's just, I don't think your mic's on.

664
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,120
Just looking at this thing though, it really looks pretty cheap to me.

665
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,320
I mean, hey, look, you've got a little hook on there.

666
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,160
You can wear it, I guess, or some, something, or have a strap on it or something.

667
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,240
That's for the little, like, wrist strap thing that they have, so you don't throw it through

668
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,920
your TV.

669
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,440
Are they gonna make the, the, the go condom or something?

670
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
Perhaps.

671
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Whatever.

672
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Go condom.

673
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
That's funny.

674
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,920
But we should be seeing an 8 gigabyte and a 16 gigabyte version.

675
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:48,600
It of course has an analog nub, but not a full stick, because of course the screen slides

676
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
upwards.

677
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,240
You've got your D-pad, start select, and your four buttons.

678
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,480
You have a Wi-Fi indicator at the top left above the screen, and you have a PS button

679
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:11,440
and a Bluetooth light, and some shoulder buttons, of course, are on the top, so.

680
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,600
But I don't know, it looks kind of cheap to me.

681
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,200
Interesting comment from SonOfDad in chat, I like this observation.

682
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,040
If you notice John Collar say that with some games being announced at E3, they knew it

683
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,680
was gonna be leaked before E3.

684
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,440
So maybe the phrasing that they used in some of the interviews, they knew this was gonna

685
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,280
be leaked before E3 actually happened.

686
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Oh, no doubt.

687
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
No doubt about it.

688
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,720
I mean, this is Sony.

689
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
And please excuse my voice tonight.

690
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,560
I don't know if I said earlier in the show, but I've like thrown out my voice this weekend

691
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,200
with some of the other stuff I had going on, so.

692
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Rob's changed his throat now.

693
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
If I crack.

694
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
He's still got a 12 year old boy.

695
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,620
I know if I crack while reading some of your chat comments, it's not puberty, okay?

696
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,940
It's just I've really hurt my voice this week.

697
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,080
But here's what really happened.

698
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,480
What?

699
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,720
Nothing.

700
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,080
So I get it, you were making a joke, all right.

701
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Anyhow.

702
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Haha.

703
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Loki, make yourself useful.

704
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
I'm giving you some gaming news.

705
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
All right.

706
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,560
So more information from the quote unquote leaked issue of CORE.

707
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,600
They also had some different games that were being announced in there as well, including

708
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,840
Gran Turismo PSP.

709
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,680
Right.

710
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,240
Gran Turismo PSP being announced for the, or being announced.

711
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,480
Was that supposed to have come out like years ago?

712
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,960
Yeah, I was like, wasn't Gran Turismo for the PSP announced like in 2005?

713
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Exactly.

714
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,000
A new Jak and Daxter game for the PSP.

715
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,520
Oh, that's a surprise.

716
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,040
And also a new Metal Gear Solid game for the PSP.

717
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Which is interesting.

718
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,440
They also had other clips, including footage from LittleBigPlanet, which that looks awesome.

719
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,240
And you know, some other stuff, possibility of Warhawk as well.

720
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I don't know.

721
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,840
But I'm sure we're going to get a lot of PSP buzz coming from the press conference N8E3.

722
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,080
To shut up those people that says that they really haven't released anything on the PSP

723
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,040
in the past year, which would be somewhat true.

724
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,140
You know what I mean?

725
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,100
Like this is to derive, I mean, especially come out on Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP.

726
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
That's huge.

727
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,800
And it's not, you know, the portable ops.

728
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
It's not acid.

729
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
It's not port.

730
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
It's, it's fricking solid.

731
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,960
So, you know, I, and I, solid.

732
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
It's a solid game.

733
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,240
Here's now one thing that didn't make our show real tonight is about the Kojima countdowns

734
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,480
that have been going on because, you know, stories about countdowns are getting a little

735
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,400
old here on horizontal radio.

736
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,000
But I mean, if this is what it is building up towards, I think it's building up to

737
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,240
multiple things, actually.

738
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,360
I think that the countdown's building up to three different announcements.

739
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,240
One being a Raiden Metal Gear Solid game, which is probably going to be for the PS3.

740
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,680
The other being this probably Metal Gear Solid game based off of kind of the timeline of

741
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,940
Metal Gear Solid 3, you know, with Big Boss.

742
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,920
And also, I think, that game Mask, which looks like a survivor horror game that he was supposed

743
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,720
to be working on a survivor horror game, so.

744
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,560
Another survival horror from Konami?

745
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,160
I mean, that would be their third.

746
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
That's big.

747
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,960
Behind Silent Hill, Saw, and now this?

748
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Really?

749
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Yeah.

750
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Interesting.

751
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,280
Well, it was supposed to be a zombie, like, you know, Left 4 Dead type of game, but still

752
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
survivor horror.

753
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,400
Oh, so, like, maybe more action-y than what we're used to.

754
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,880
I don't know, but it's a creepy picture that they have, so.

755
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,680
Uh, DarkTetsuya seems to agree with you.

756
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,440
It says in chat, you know, Loki's probably right.

757
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,720
You might want to be careful when you say things like that.

758
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,440
Don't let it get to his head.

759
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,080
Alright, I'm curious, chat room, what do you guys think?

760
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,720
Do you think Loki's right?

761
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,160
Do you think it means three different games could possibly be on their way?

762
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,760
Or this could be the E3 of nothing but Metal Gear, which would, you know, kind of make

763
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,760
sense a little bit, because we haven't heard a lot coming out of Konami's camp.

764
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
They've got some good stuff.

765
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,240
We'll have more later on, and I'm sure they're going to be showcasing the Saw game and some

766
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
of their music games.

767
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Boo!

768
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
What else?

769
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,280
They've also got that, uh, there wasn't a lot that came out of their Gamers' Day.

770
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,440
There's that one that looked like Castlevania, but wasn't Castlevania, which I don't remember

771
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,120
the hell that game was called, but we were supposed to be talking about last week, and

772
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:16,480
then there was also, you know, their music games, Saw, Silent Hill, the new one that's

773
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,280
Shattered Memories or whatever that was.

774
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,960
Oh yeah, the Wii one.

775
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
Which actually looks really cool.

776
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,440
It's apparently different each time you play it, depending on how you answer their personality

777
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
profile thing.

778
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,520
It's like the eHarmony of Survivor Horror.

779
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
Hooray!

780
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,000
You better hurry up and trademark that!

781
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,680
I hope it doesn't reject me for being a fag, just like eHarmony would.

782
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,640
Don't just put a gay bar where the bar normally goes.

783
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:50,200
No, and then they have some other game, it's like Tornadoes.

784
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,320
It'll make all the zombies just want to dance.

785
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,320
That's horrible.

786
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:03,160
Prop 8 will attack you instead.

787
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,240
Prop 8 will kick me in the face.

788
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
That's what I'll get.

789
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,760
There's way too much gay going on in the show right now.

790
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,800
Anyway, so they've got stuff that haven't been announced yet.

791
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,920
Tornadoes Outbreak was the other game, which is coming out in September.

792
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,880
I don't know what the hell it is, but it's a game from Konami, and it has tornadoes in

793
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
it.

794
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
It's like tornadoes!

795
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,680
An outbreak of them.

796
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,960
Alright well guess what, Sony doesn't just make Playstations and PSPs.

797
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,800
Believe it or not, they're actually a pretty big company.

798
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm not sure if you've heard of Sony before, but they do a lot outside of just the games.

799
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,640
One of the things they develop is mobile phones.

800
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
Sony what?

801
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,120
That's right, Sony develops a phone called the iKnow.

802
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
I think I'm saying that right.

803
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,840
A-I-N-O, the iKnow mobile phone.

804
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,760
Now this is like a new phone that they're doing.

805
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,820
It's not something that's out yet, and it's not to be confused with that PSP phone that's

806
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,320
been rumored about before, but apparently what this phone will do, you'll actually be

807
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,360
able to use remote play to access your PlayStation 3.

808
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,680
And here's the thing, the device has 3G on it, so here's the deal.

809
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,480
When you get on this, you can use the 3G to like stream movies, images, music from your

810
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,200
PlayStation 3 hard drive.

811
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Isn't that kind of neat?

812
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,960
Yeah, so if you have porn saved on your drive, you could have that anywhere streaming over

813
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,960
3G.

814
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,880
What a waste of our bandwidth.

815
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Porn anywhere?

816
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,200
Wow, that sounds like the internet.

817
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,960
Oh wait, it is the internet.

818
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,680
Well here's the other deal, in Europe you can get Play TV.

819
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,240
You'll be able to view, rewind, pause, whatever live television, and you can also record it

820
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,920
while you're on the go, the way the mobile phone is.

821
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,280
That's technology we've never seen before.

822
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,600
So if you forget like, oh crap, I was supposed to record Grey's Anatomy or whatever, you

823
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,680
can set it from your phone I guess.

824
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,480
Keep in mind though, for the most part, cell phones in Japan have been just decades ahead

825
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,880
of what we've had here for the longest time until we started trickling out with Trios

826
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,200
and Blackberries and finally the iPhone.

827
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,080
Now we have all these apps for iPhones that will do all this crap for us.

828
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,840
But still, I mean, this is probably really nothing major.

829
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,320
This is expected probably.

830
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,800
Yeah, I don't think the Sony I know has a shaking baby application.

831
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
That's something that's missing.

832
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,120
The iPhone doesn't have it anymore.

833
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Not anymore.

834
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,520
They don't have the cocaine application anymore either.

835
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
There was a cocaine application?

836
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,320
You could sort the thing and then...

837
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
It's a hell of a drug.

838
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,760
We actually talked about it in my typography class.

839
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Wow.

840
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,840
How is that relevant to typography?

841
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,640
Do you make letters out of the coke?

842
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,480
I know a lot of...

843
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,960
Were some of the best fonts designed?

844
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Never mind.

845
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,960
A lot of some of the best fonts were designed by a lot of people who were on lots of stuff.

846
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Alright.

847
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Let's see.

848
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,760
Rama says, so grab your dick and double click for porn, porn, porn.

849
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,720
Game Guru says, why would I TiVo Grey's Anatomy?

850
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
I don't know.

851
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Obviously someone is.

852
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
The show's still on.

853
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
Exactly.

854
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
You have to watch it live.

855
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,560
Misty says, no, the internet is for OLR, which is the gateway to porn.

856
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Get it right, Game Guru.

857
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,040
Oh, sorry.

858
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,120
Dark Shy says, 3G coverage isn't exactly everywhere, is it?

859
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,480
I saw a map of 3G coverage for the newest iPhone.

860
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,320
I don't think it's everywhere, but for the big city people, I don't know where you live,

861
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,400
but I can tell you living here in Sacramento and the places I go the most are San Francisco,

862
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,280
LA, the places I drive.

863
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,680
I don't ever lose 3G unless I'm in the basement of a building or behind solid wood.

864
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,960
Walls where the signal can't reach and I'll go on edge.

865
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,280
Like I get 3G everywhere.

866
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,080
Well, I, and to be perfectly honest, you don't even need 3G really to get good signal in

867
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
a major city.

868
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Yeah.

869
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,340
So I've never wanted it.

870
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,780
I mean the, I know I've heard a lot of complaints about AT&T and their coverage, but it's been

871
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,780
fine for me.

872
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,960
Very, very rare.

873
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,800
Do I not have 3G?

874
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
So I don't know.

875
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Maybe I'm just lucky.

876
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Now we have 4G.

877
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,300
Yeah, I know.

878
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,300
Fricking Apple.

879
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,300
Yay.

880
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,680
Do you hear this rumor about the, the dormant video thing that's been in everybody's phone

881
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,040
the whole time that they're finally going to turn on with iPhone 3.0?

882
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
Boy.

883
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Oh boy.

884
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,280
You mean the thing that there's been a homebrew apps that have already been doing it?

885
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Yeah.

886
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
That.

887
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,900
So, I mean just a huge selling point they could have with the iPhone this whole time

888
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,280
that they just, just, just because they can do that.

889
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,160
But then again, Nintendo does the same shit.

890
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,040
So there's also, um, uh, apps for, um, video play for not video, but for a sound recording.

891
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
Yeah.

892
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,760
That, that, you know, I've, I've had mine forever.

893
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,320
I haven't used it, but I have it.

894
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,360
Alright, well let's move on with some more, uh, gaming news, Dark Sakura.

895
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,920
Well, something that I have been particularly looking forward to, and I'm glad finally has

896
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,360
somewhat of a date, is, um, Star Trek Online.

897
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,400
Because I want my own ship, dammit.

898
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,480
Um, and according to- And I would like to throw tribbles at Dark

899
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Sakura.

900
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,040
As long as you don't feed them.

901
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,080
Remember if you feed them, then they breed.

902
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,440
I have, by the way, had the most tribble-tastic week, because I think I've watched trials

903
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,440
and tribulations, like, four times this last week.

904
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Nerd.

905
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,800
And trouble with tribbles once.

906
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,920
And then we tried to watch the animated episode, and then the people watching it with me complained

907
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,160
about the bad animation quality.

908
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,120
I swear I didn't mean to derail your story.

909
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,400
Um, anyway.

910
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,160
According to one of, um, Atari's financial documents, it says that they expect Star Trek

911
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,360
Online to be out no later than March 31st, 2010.

912
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:38,240
And it will be, um, both console and PC, according to the document.

913
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:46,160
Um, nothing official from Cryptic yet, um, but I'm sure that we should see something

914
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
soon.

915
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
All right.

916
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Hopefully.

917
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,800
I want to play!

918
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,080
I know.

919
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,600
Talk about the game that'll make me leave any MMO I'm playing.

920
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,520
Wherever, wherever my fickle ass is at the moment, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XI,

921
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,920
Hal-Ragnarok, I don't know, maybe I'll get into EVE before this is all over.

922
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,080
I'm going to Star Trek Online the minute this comes out.

923
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,560
I need to make the O.L.O.R.I.E.N.s.

924
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,560
Yes.

925
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,400
I will be putting official data out for what these specs are to make an O.L.O.R.I.E.N.

926
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,760
And I want nothing but, I want to captain my own ship of nothing but red-shirt people.

927
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,520
You can't, because you have to, you have to have command people.

928
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Damn it!

929
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
You have to have doctors.

930
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,960
All right.

931
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,440
Every MMO talk is bad now.

932
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
Just wait until this game comes out.

933
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,160
Wait to see how nerdy we all get.

934
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Again, and I say this every time, and I'm going to say it every time, every week, every

935
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,240
time this game gets brought up, I'm going to say this.

936
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,100
This game better not suck.

937
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,160
Star Trek has so much momentum going for it right now.

938
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Please.

939
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,120
There will be riots in the streets.

940
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
It will be me.

941
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
It'll just be Rob.

942
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
It will be me.

943
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
He'll be out there going, riot!

944
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,720
I made a dark sakura, I will like throw a Slurpee against a window of a 7-11.

945
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,200
That'll be my riot, okay?

946
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,320
I will be pissed if this game sucks, and we'll put it on YouTube or something.

947
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,120
You know, as the classic line from the movie goes, better to be pissed off than pissed

948
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
on.

949
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,440
Rama says, Sky will request a pink starship with sparkles.

950
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
No.

951
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
No.

952
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,520
You, wait, you're freaking like stereotyping or something?

953
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
No, I do not want a pink starship with sparkles.

954
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,080
I want a purple starship with sparkles, ass.

955
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,520
And Stickaxe asks, what if the game sucks, Rob?

956
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Well, you heard me, riot.

957
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,440
Then we take to the streets.

958
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,560
Then we protest in front of Atari.

959
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,040
It'll be a- We get all the people at Cryptic and we-

960
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,740
It'll be a dual protest.

961
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,900
One side of the sign will say, overturn Prop 8, and the other side will say, remake Star

962
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,560
Trek because this version sucks.

963
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,120
And then we subject the people at Cryptic that are in charge of that to-

964
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,760
Um, investigation by special means.

965
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,760
Alright.

966
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,200
By, um, probing.

967
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,560
That's right.

968
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,560
There you go.

969
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,560
There's the answer.

970
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
If this game sucks, anal probes.

971
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,560
Exactly.

972
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,560
Alright.

973
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,640
And I'll tell you what, just for that, I'm putting a model of the Enterprise in my home.

974
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,000
Let's probe around the world right now and look at the upcoming release dates for upcoming

975
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
games.

976
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yes.

977
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,360
We've got a few things coming up this week, um, including Fuel, which is gonna be awesome.

978
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,880
That's on, uh, PS3 and Xbox 360, I think also the PC, but I don't see that.

979
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,160
Hey, last thing, I'm sorry, every time you say that, the Metallica song pops into my

980
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
head?

981
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
Yes.

982
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,640
Give me fuel, give me fire, give me that, what's hard to say?

983
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,800
That's the only thing that's disappointing about that game.

984
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,240
The music kinda sucks, cause it's not really any licensed music except for the theme song,

985
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,720
which is by Uncle, which is pretty cool, and actually one of my previous cage match picks

986
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,680
um, but yeah, all the rest of the music in the game is just kind of like, eh.

987
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,280
But they do support custom soundtracks, so that's always good.

988
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,840
I like how you said that, it's kinda eh.

989
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,960
Um, okay, but other things coming out.

990
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,640
Age of Pirates 2, City of Abandoned, on PC.

991
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,200
Arrrrr, it's abandoned.

992
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,480
Uh, Chicken, er, Crazy Chicken Atlantis Quest on DS.

993
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,760
Fuck these games, weren't there like three of them last week?

994
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,480
Crazy Chicken Star Carts on DS.

995
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,240
These are probably the same games from last week, they just never came out.

996
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,240
Um.

997
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
Gee, I wonder why.

998
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,000
Crazy Chicken Pharaoh's Treasure on DS.

999
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,040
Yes, Mumbo Jumbo doesn't know anything about hitting dates as far as releases go.

1000
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:35,120
Um, Red Faction Guerrilla coming out on Xbox 360 and PS3, that game looks awesome.

1001
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,000
The main feature, I guess, was explosions, and you know, can't go wrong there.

1002
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I like explosions.

1003
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And it's on Mars.

1004
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,240
Crazy Chicken is actually, if any of these Crazy Chicken games are actually good games,

1005
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,120
I will eat, like a cup of mayonnaise.

1006
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,160
And anyone who knows me, knows that that is like my own personal hell right there.

1007
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,880
If these games are actually any good, I will down an entire cup of mayonnaise, live on

1008
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,880
air.

1009
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,120
No, you have to understand, this is a character that's popular, apparently popular, in, um,

1010
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,120
the UK.

1011
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,840
And so they, they get the licensing rights really cheap, and they bring them over here.

1012
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,600
It's just like Moomin, which, you know, this company Graffiti is bringing over.

1013
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
I don't even know what the hell that is.

1014
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,640
It's even better that, you know, I, no disrespect to whatever they like over there in the UK,

1015
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,880
but then you're basically just telling me, oh, on top of already thinking these games

1016
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,040
are gonna suck, you're telling me they're licensed games, and how, you know, off of

1017
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,600
TV and movie properties, how often are those games any good?

1018
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,600
They're not.

1019
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,120
Um, Knights of the Nightmare on DS, coming from Atlus.

1020
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,840
And then, of course, you know, one of the bigger titles of the week, Sims 3, coming

1021
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,800
out on PC, also available in a collector's edition, where you get a bunch of useless

1022
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
crap.

1023
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,400
Um, and then the game with the longest title of the week, and I don't know why, but Johnny

1024
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,720
Bravo and the hunk-a-mega-mighty ultra-extreme Datorama.

1025
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,200
Yes, the title may be long, but the game still sucks.

1026
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,560
Wow.

1027
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,760
And, um, then, of course, we've got some other fun stuff.

1028
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,280
More party games from Majesco, go play lumberjacks, lumberjack-themed games, and go play Circus

1029
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,320
Star, where you can play as a, you know, circus performer.

1030
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,600
Is it a lumberjack and it's okay?

1031
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
Maybe.

1032
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:20,680
And then Emergency Disaster Rescue Squad, coming to the DS from Destineer.

1033
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,760
And finally, a week from today, the legendary Starfy, a game that apparently is a franchise

1034
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,000
in Japan.

1035
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,360
I don't know anything about it and it looks stupid, but, you know, that's just my dumb

1036
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,160
American opinion.

1037
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
Questions from chat.

1038
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
Marissa is in chat.

1039
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Hi, Marissa.

1040
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,740
Marissa Gungusto asks, no Rob, not Mayo, don't do it.

1041
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,540
You know what, I'm that confident that I'm right, so I'm not even worried about it.

1042
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,320
It's just like Loki doing the bet on Eye of Judgment, the legendary bet that people still

1043
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,480
haven't shut up about two years later.

1044
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,280
He was that confident in it, and you know what, he was right.

1045
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,600
Stickaxe asks, how would we determine whether they're any good, Rob?

1046
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,160
Would it be that the games have a Metacritic score above a certain amount?

1047
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,920
I suppose, but honestly, you've been listening to this show long enough.

1048
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,920
You can trust me.

1049
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,960
If the games are good, I will tell you, and we will do it.

1050
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,440
And if you don't believe me, you think I'm lying, we can get like a, we can agree upon

1051
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,880
a non-discriminatory panel or something.

1052
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,880
I don't know.

1053
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,280
But I'm that confident these games are no good.

1054
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,400
Come on.

1055
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,760
Games like this are a dime a dozen.

1056
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,280
Do you really think there's a chance in hell I'm eating the mayonnaise?

1057
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,480
Hell no, otherwise I wouldn't have said it.

1058
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,040
Are you looking it up on Metacritic right now?

1059
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:36,080
Okay, this has got to go then on the official, you know, the official stuff, you know, ongoing

1060
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,280
bets on the show.

1061
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,360
You know, I think this game is so awesome, it's not even on there.

1062
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,480
Oh wait, here we go, here's the last one that came out on DS.

1063
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,720
Chicken Hunter, which is also the same franchise, they just changed the name, got a Metacritic

1064
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,640
rating of three, or thirty-nine.

1065
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,360
It's quality right there.

1066
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,360
There you go, exactly.

1067
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,360
I have nothing to worry about.

1068
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,760
You could probably go off Metacritic and I'd be just fine.

1069
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,960
Hey, let's talk about something interesting, and that is the Japanese release dates, although

1070
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,000
I do like Marissa's idea of making it bacon-aise, to make it a little easier on me.

1071
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,560
Dude, bacon-aise is great.

1072
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,240
So if I do, I do want to put that clause in the contract, just in case.

1073
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,160
The cup of mayonnaise do be bacon-aise, and I think everybody would agree, just for my

1074
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,960
own sanity and well-being, that would be the way to do it, thank you.

1075
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,800
I will end up in the hospital again with pancreatitis if I lose this bet.

1076
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
Just wait.

1077
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,800
Uh, anyway.

1078
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,960
That's why we'll get you some fat-free mayonnaise.

1079
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,440
Yeah, fat-free bacon-aise, good luck.

1080
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,200
They're gonna have to like, invent it.

1081
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:40,320
Alright, on the Xbox 360, I'm gonna have to fucking eat Miracle Whip.

1082
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,040
Eww, gross.

1083
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:49,080
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan, nothing.

1084
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,240
It is completely empty until June 25th.

1085
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,320
There is like, nothing on the calendar right now for the Xbox 360.

1086
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,560
It's pretty boring right now over in Japan.

1087
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,080
Just not a busy time of year for them, and PlayStation 3 really doesn't look much different,

1088
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,080
I have to be honest.

1089
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,880
It's a very slow week over there.

1090
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,320
Um, moving on, however, to the Nintendo Wii, at least you get Ark Rise Fantasia comes out

1091
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,920
in Japan from Marvelous.

1092
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,200
That comes out on the Wii this week.

1093
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,000
That's really the only release to look forward to there.

1094
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,200
And taking a look at the PlayStation 2, Evangelion Joe comes out there.

1095
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
What?

1096
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,200
More Eva games?

1097
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
Of course, of course.

1098
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,320
There's just no other, uh, no other way to do it over there.

1099
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,480
And on the Nintendo DS, you have a few more options.

1100
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:34,040
You have Kotowari Sahai Simulation Ochanomapro Yaku D.S. is the name of that game.

1101
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,720
I'm not sure what exactly you're simulating.

1102
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,600
Oh, it looks like baseball, looks like a baseball coach game.

1103
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,660
This is, yeah.

1104
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,660
So there you go.

1105
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,660
That's baseball.

1106
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,040
Very quick on the PSP to see if there's anything of interest there, although I highly doubt

1107
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,040
it.

1108
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,200
Oh, you get a port of that same Evangelion game on the PSP.

1109
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,200
And that's really it.

1110
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
Kids like Eva.

1111
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,200
That's right.

1112
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
That's really it for Japanese releases.

1113
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,000
It's kind of a slow, uh, week for them.

1114
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,040
Well, how about we go overseas, um, in another direction?

1115
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,200
Here's, um, stuff that, uh, is coming out in, um, UK.

1116
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:09,160
We have, on the 5th, actually, a bunch of releases, um, at least a handful, anyway.

1117
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:17,080
We play Control Donkey Kong Jungle Beat on Wii, Red Faction Gorilla on Xbox 360 and PS3,

1118
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:24,740
Sacred 2 Fallen Angel on Xbox 360 and PS3, Star Ocean The Last Hope on Xbox 360, Walk

1119
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,760
With Me Do You Know Your Walking Routine on DS.

1120
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,840
No, I forgot how to walk.

1121
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,840
It's your walking routine.

1122
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,840
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

1123
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
Routine.

1124
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,240
So do I get to make a walking, like, dance routine or something?

1125
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,680
It's scheduling your walks, I guess.

1126
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,680
I guess.

1127
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,960
And then Sims 3, of course, which, yay!

1128
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,960
Happy.

1129
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,000
That's it.

1130
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,240
I don't remember you being so Sims fangirly.

1131
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,360
It's like it came out of the woodworks, or we awakened a sleeping beast within or something.

1132
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,360
I'm not sure where the- Well, it basically took at least, you know,

1133
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,920
four people I know starting to play and playing again, but I was like, uh, me as well.

1134
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,360
And then I was like, I really just like building houses.

1135
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,360
That's really it.

1136
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,640
I don't care about playing the game.

1137
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:12,160
I don't care about how many babies my Sims have, or, you know, who gets bitten by a vampire

1138
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,400
and who kills zombies.

1139
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,560
I care about building the houses.

1140
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,200
You sound kind of similar to Loki in how he, a lot of these games he plays, he doesn't

1141
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,200
really care about the game.

1142
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,520
He just cares about how he can hack it to his liking.

1143
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,720
I'm, like, look at my house.

1144
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,600
I am building a freaking gorgeous house.

1145
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,600
It's very red, so far.

1146
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,160
Well, that's just a wall.

1147
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,680
Well, the walls are red.

1148
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Let's see.

1149
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,680
All right.

1150
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,680
You've built this live on air.

1151
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,680
You started from scratch at the beginning of the night, right?

1152
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,680
I started on, I actually started it last night.

1153
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,680
Oh, I thought you did the whole thing on air tonight.

1154
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,680
Here's my entire house.

1155
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,680
There's, see, there's my potty.

1156
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Oh.

1157
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,680
And there's the upstairs.

1158
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,680
All right.

1159
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,680
Anyhow.

1160
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,680
This is horrible radio.

1161
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,680
They can't see it.

1162
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,680
I'll put pictures up eventually.

1163
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,680
All right.

1164
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
Uh, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1165
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,080
We will get into the classic game of the week and our break tonight pretty soon.

1166
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,440
We still have about 10 more stories to go over, so, uh, Loki, we've got to get to it.

1167
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,440
Sorry.

1168
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm looking at a picture.

1169
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That's funny.

1170
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,820
Um, DJ Hero, a game that we've been talking about for quite a while now, lots of stuff

1171
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:10,420
coming out this week, especially, um, game trailers ran an exclusive, um, E3 trailer

1172
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:16,280
that they put out showing some of the gameplay, um, which is not surprising, you know, it

1173
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,980
looks very much how they described it in the magazine, but we've got some more details

1174
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,980
now.

1175
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,720
They're going to have a few different versus modes, including DJ versus DJ, uh, DJ plus

1176
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,980
DJ, you know, like a co-op or DJ plus guitar, um, you know, for the 10 tracks that they

1177
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:36,640
have, um, you know, guitar support for, and, um, of course, you know, the game's going

1178
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,840
to be coming out on all platforms, rumored to be $120.

1179
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:47,520
Yeah, that's kind of expensive, and, um, also they're going to be having a limited edition,

1180
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,840
um, pack coming out that's going to be, uh, tying in with Jay-Z and Eminem.

1181
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:59,120
Apparently this is going to come with an advanced version of the controller, a DJ stand, a metal

1182
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:06,960
traveling case, and also, um, the greatest hit CDs from both rappers, and sadly enough

1183
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,820
I want to get that.

1184
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:14,240
Not because I'm fans of them, but because I like the idea of, you know, a DJ stand and

1185
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,500
a metal traveling case, so it would be all sorts of nerdy cool.

1186
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,160
This is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3.

1187
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,480
I want to see how they're pulling this off, because I love the concept, everything I'm

1188
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,000
seeing, you know, I was a little nervous when I first heard they were making this game,

1189
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,200
but everything I'm hearing, I love the idea of the songs all being mashups, everything

1190
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,480
sounds good, but it's all in the execution.

1191
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,480
This is the game I am most looking forward to playing at E3.

1192
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,940
Yep, same here.

1193
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,360
Did you see the video though this week where they did, uh, it was, um, Rick James, Give

1194
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,840
It To Me Baby, and then also, um, Hollaback Girl mixed together?

1195
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,240
No, I hadn't seen that.

1196
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,360
Oh, you gotta see that.

1197
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,120
Oh my god, they have video of gameplay now?

1198
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,120
Yeah.

1199
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
No, I totally missed that.

1200
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,120
Yeah.

1201
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Oh my gosh, I gotta see that.

1202
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,800
So, um, they have an interview, uh, video that shows some gameplay, and then they also

1203
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,280
have the actual official trailer that has that song in there, but it's interesting.

1204
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,480
Well, our chat room is lighting up right now with comparisons, of course, whenever it seems

1205
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,320
like the DJ games get brought up, 2DX gets brought up, um, interesting enough, the next

1206
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,780
story I have has to do with Bamani and, uh, what could possibly be next in the US.

1207
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,560
It's about another music series, not Beatmania, but Poppin' Music.

1208
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,840
Now, you might remember, we all declared Poppin' Music dead in the US, uh, when Beat and Groovy

1209
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
crashed and burned.

1210
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,200
Remember that one on Xbox Live Marketplace?

1211
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,200
Oh my god.

1212
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,760
Damn it, Rob, I've been trying to forget about that.

1213
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,760
It was terrible.

1214
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,080
It was basically an American translation of Poppin' Music, but to call it that would be

1215
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,160
like, I don't even know how to begin to describe it.

1216
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,240
It was, it was a terrible, terrible, uh, port of Poppin' Music.

1217
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,760
It should have been cancelled by Konami before it ever came out.

1218
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,560
Uh, but what's interesting though, we might have been wrong.

1219
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,160
Poppin' Music may not be dead in the US.

1220
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,600
Apparently, there has been a trademark filed that indicates that Poppin' Music is coming

1221
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,760
to North America, and of course, if you've never played Poppin' Music before, it's like

1222
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,680
these nine giant, like, imagine the Poppa-matic bubbles from Trouble.

1223
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,440
Imagine there's nine of them all laid out in kind of a keyboard-y format.

1224
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,840
Uh, that's what the machine looks like, and it plays very similar to these beat-matching

1225
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,840
games.

1226
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,320
Um, but now this trademark was filed, and everybody thought, okay, well, maybe they

1227
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,720
are gonna bring it to the US.

1228
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,000
Well, apparently, a little more was released when Konami actually dropped the Poppin' Music

1229
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,120
Wii page.

1230
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,040
That's right, Poppin' Music appears to be headed towards the Wii, but what's most interesting

1231
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,360
about it, the screenshots do not look 100% like the Poppin' Music we know and love right

1232
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,360
now.

1233
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,160
It looks like, uh, the game could be a little bit different.

1234
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,760
Uh, apparently, there might be some online support as well.

1235
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,880
Maybe that could be download songs, who knows?

1236
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,140
But apparently, even box art has gone up for Japan, and, uh, it does look like it's gonna

1237
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,200
bring over a lot of the Japanese characters.

1238
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,480
It'll be very interesting to see if this is, uh, debuted at E3, because apparently, the

1239
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,360
Wii remote and nunchucks do come into play, which is weird, because they weren't a part

1240
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,680
of the original game.

1241
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,120
But maybe they're trying to translate this somehow for play with the Wiimotes, and not

1242
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,600
the 9 configuration without having to release a new controller.

1243
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,600
No idea.

1244
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
This could be very interesting.

1245
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,860
They're not gonna put in, like, like, freestyle mode or anything, are they?

1246
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,860
No idea.

1247
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,560
Some people are saying maybe it's like a Poppin' Music adventure kind of game, I, I don't,

1248
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,560
which is, I guess, a spin-off series that happened in Japan.

1249
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,640
I'm not as familiar with it, despite all the Bomani I do know about.

1250
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,520
I'm not as familiar with the adventure series, but, uh, apparently, the game is coming out

1251
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
August 6th.

1252
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,400
So, if there is an American version of this coming out, which the trademark would lead

1253
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,440
you to believe, we might see it at E3.

1254
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,080
That would be very interesting.

1255
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,080
That's just bizarre.

1256
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,080
Yeah.

1257
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,080
Very bizarre.

1258
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,080
Who knows?

1259
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,080
More to come on this, uh, probably this next week.

1260
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,080
We'll see.

1261
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,820
Well, I do have sad news for the five people still playing Matrix online.

1262
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,820
All five of you.

1263
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,440
I'm counting you.

1264
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,760
Well, you're SOL now.

1265
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,400
It's, uh, actually, you know what?

1266
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
I picked the wrong thing.

1267
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
Oh, that's...

1268
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
No, no, yeah, I did.

1269
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,400
Sorry.

1270
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,400
I did pick the right thing.

1271
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Oops!

1272
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,400
Live radio!

1273
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,400
These things happen sometimes.

1274
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,400
Why don't you start it from the top?

1275
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:13,880
Well, um, for the five people who are still playing this, um, sorry, guys, Sony hates

1276
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,120
you.

1277
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,920
They really do hate you.

1278
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,280
Um, actually, uh, Sony of Europe is pulling, um, Matrix online.

1279
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,640
It is being shut down.

1280
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:29,680
You, I'm sorry, Sony, I want to say Sony of Europe, uh, Sony Online Entertainment, sorry,

1281
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,000
will be, um, closing it down on July 31st.

1282
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,720
You better get in your, your Matrixing while you can, and then prepare to swallow your

1283
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,040
blue pill.

1284
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,560
Before somebody unplugs you.

1285
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,560
You're done.

1286
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,560
No more.

1287
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,760
Wait for private servers to pop up.

1288
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,760
I'm not surprised.

1289
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,760
Neither am I.

1290
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,760
Me neither.

1291
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,760
I really didn't realize.

1292
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,880
I actually thought it ended a long time ago.

1293
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,880
Exactly.

1294
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,680
Was that the end of the world event or something in there?

1295
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,680
Like a long time?

1296
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,680
That was the beta.

1297
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,000
Oh, I thought the damn thing was done a long time ago.

1298
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,600
I thought so, too, but I think that was just the beta.

1299
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Yeah.

1300
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:08,120
Actually, um, it was, uh, the, Ben Chamberlain, who was the designer in GM, um, was the one

1301
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:12,480
doing all the content updates, the one keeping everything alive, and then he left.

1302
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,840
So, um, basically, they're gonna be doing, though, some sort of monumental end of the

1303
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,480
world thing, and then that's it.

1304
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,760
They'll do the exact same thing they did for the beta.

1305
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,480
I'm, I'm kinda curious here, Gold Anthro is in chat, and apparently, as somewhat of a

1306
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,880
fan of The Matrix Online, says, I was following the story of that.

1307
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,800
They could at least finish the story properly, maybe make a second Animatrix collection based

1308
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,000
on the events of the MMO.

1309
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Um, but, Jamie, a lot of fun of that game is the story.

1310
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
That's why I followed it and tried the free trial.

1311
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,680
So, another opinion from chat.orangelandraday.com.

1312
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,880
I mean, for hardcore fans of The Matrix, to be fair, as much as we're teasing the game,

1313
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,240
because the game itself didn't look to be a lot of fun, at least when I saw Loki playing

1314
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:55,200
it a long time ago, um, it, it was, for fans of The Matrix, they were continually building

1315
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,560
in this, that universe.

1316
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,560
They were continually the story.

1317
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,560
They really were.

1318
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:03,760
Didn't they kill off one of the major characters from the movie, like, in the game or something?

1319
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,440
Uh, I don't, I don't remember, I just, kinda asking that out loud, I'm sure I'd get a response

1320
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,440
from chat.

1321
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,660
Really, I didn't keep up with it enough to notice, so.

1322
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,660
Thank you.

1323
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,660
Morpheus, apparently, allegedly died.

1324
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,200
I thought one of the main characters there.

1325
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,560
Well, who misses him?

1326
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,040
Chat.orangelandraday.com, well, if you're a fan of The Matrix series, then you might.

1327
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,600
So, alright, well, uh, we'll see, um, I guess, uh, if, uh, any pirate servers pop up or what

1328
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,200
the, what game these fans plan to go to, if anything.

1329
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,200
Yes.

1330
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:38,200
And, as, uh, The Matrix Online dies, another thing comes back from the dead.

1331
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
What?

1332
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,000
EGM, actually, is back now, um, to the, you know, praise of many of its fans.

1333
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Um, apparently, EGM was sold to its original founder, and, um, he's planning on starting

1334
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,280
a publication in print and as well as online, and, uh, no word yet if, you know, any of

1335
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:04,420
the staff members that were fired, you know, back when UGO bought up, um, the 1UP brand,

1336
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,060
if they're going to, somehow, um, you know, bring those people back.

1337
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,180
Maybe some people will return back, you know, I'm sure if they're asked, but, um, they have

1338
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:16,120
an exciting plan for, um, you know, taking this magazine to the next evolution, they

1339
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:20,140
say, so, um, it's interesting, though, because that was actually a pretty good magazine.

1340
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:27,040
With it gone, it's pretty much just Game Informer, which is in bed.

1341
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,300
You know, um, is there a lot, now, an interesting question is, playing devil's advocate here,

1342
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,760
especially in this economy, in this world we live in, with the internet and everything,

1343
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,860
is there a demand for print publication?

1344
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:39,880
I think, well, I mean, like, Game Informer's pretty good.

1345
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:46,000
Um, you know, I, if, I wouldn't probably voluntarily sign up for it, unless, you know, I get the

1346
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,400
discount cards through GameStop, and that's really the only incentive, but, um, you know,

1347
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,360
they've had a lot of exclusive stories lately, and probably because they're GameStop and

1348
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:00,600
can afford to say, hey, give us the exclusive story on this, or, um, you know, we won't

1349
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,800
buy as much, you know, that type of stuff, so.

1350
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,840
Which has to violate some type of antitrust law, just by the way.

1351
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
Or it could be the other way around.

1352
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,640
It could be that they're giving them that because they're like, hey, look at, you know,

1353
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:17,080
our user base, you know, for this magazine, it's huge, and yeah, it is huge because you,

1354
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:22,400
you get it when you sign up for this card that basically pays for itself pretty quick.

1355
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,400
I don't know.

1356
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,680
Um, it's not bad, but still, I think there is room for more, you know, gaming publications

1357
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,680
out there.

1358
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,560
I mean, hell, I mean, EGM hasn't even gone that long.

1359
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,520
Well, you know what, one thing I am gonna appreciate for Electronic Gaming Monthly being

1360
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
back is that now-

1361
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,360
You're a game pro if you need to get rid of one.

1362
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,520
One thing I do miss about Electronic Gaming Monthly is that now I'll have something to

1363
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,380
read on the shitter again, because what a better, what better place to read video gaming

1364
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,380
magazines, because, you know, certainly some of the articles in Electronic Gaming Monthly

1365
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:58,760
make me want to facilitate release, so I'm extremely happy that I will have a new bathroom

1366
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,760
reader.

1367
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,420
Rob, you're such a goof.

1368
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,420
So there you go.

1369
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:05,720
EGM coming soon to a bathroom near you.

1370
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:10,960
Hey, uh, hopefully not gonna end up in your bathroom, but in your, uh, console.

1371
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,160
Squeenix has a brand new, believe it or not, it's not Final Fantasy XIV, it's not, you

1372
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:22,000
know, Kingdom Hearts XI, it is a brand new franchise, it's something called N.I.E.R.

1373
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Nier, although that might be a little bit deceptive, because I guess it's like a new

1374
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,400
type of front mission game.

1375
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,400
No, no.

1376
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,400
There's two different games.

1377
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,400
Oh, okay.

1378
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
It's two different ones.

1379
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,400
Phew.

1380
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
Okay, so N.I.E.R.

1381
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,400
Nier is, uh, one of the, oh, okay, I see what you're saying.

1382
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,760
It's a hack and slash action game, it looks fucking awesome.

1383
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,760
Really?

1384
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,760
I didn't look at the videos of this yet.

1385
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,760
Yeah, you need to.

1386
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,760
What's it kinda look like?

1387
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:47,960
Um, I don't know, it's just, it's really like, um, like a bloody action game, I mean, you

1388
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,760
know, there's not, it's not like a Castlevania or anything like that, it's just really cool

1389
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,760
looking.

1390
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,480
Well apparently this is a game being developed by the Bullet Witch and Resident Evil Umbrella

1391
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:05,120
Chronicles Makers, same folks who made those games, but it wasn't Bullet Witch kinda, no.

1392
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:10,520
I hope they learn their lesson, because, uh, see, it kinda sucks, because Umbrella Chronicles

1393
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:17,520
wasn't that bad, but Bullet Witch was really fucking bad, so, uh, that's tough.

1394
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,940
By the way, just kind of on a side note, this is a Final Fantasy and the PSP bundle that

1395
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:23,720
will be coming with it, August 25th.

1396
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,640
Yeah, the new front mission game that's coming out is gonna be a little bit different, because

1397
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,160
you remember, front mission is more of a tactical strategy game, whereas this one's gonna be

1398
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:35,080
like Armored Core, it's just, you know, get in the mech, kill things, which I can get

1399
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,080
behind that.

1400
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,920
Shadow Next Gen in chat says, I want Kingdom Hearts 3, dammit.

1401
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,920
You know what, me too.

1402
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,300
Like, I know they have these spin-off games coming this year, and sadly I think that's

1403
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,260
all we're gonna get is the DS and PSP Kingdom Hearts games that, you know, I think the ones

1404
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:50,840
that are coming out in Japan are gonna come here too inevitably, but you know what, Disney

1405
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:54,960
has a huge booth at E3 this year, and granted I know they have all their little, you know,

1406
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,360
Hannah Montana and, you know, whatever type games that they do, which is probably in reality

1407
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:04,520
all you're gonna see there, there's a part of me that just really hopes maybe Kingdom

1408
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,880
Hearts 3 is a surprise announcement.

1409
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,600
They have split second, which looks awesome.

1410
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,440
At least something, throw me a frickin' bone here, show me a new teaser trailer, give me

1411
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,060
something to look forward to in 2010 after Final Fantasy 13 is out.

1412
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:20,000
You know, I would hope if nothing else, if they do the whole Square Theater or whatever

1413
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,200
again, that we see a little bit of a tease of Kingdom Hearts 3.

1414
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,960
Well, Square likes to tease games that aren't coming out for a few years anyway, so...

1415
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,720
And that's all I'm asking for.

1416
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,840
Just let me know it's really happening.

1417
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:35,380
Remind me that Kingdom Hearts 3 is happening, remind me that you're not gonna do this weird

1418
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:40,120
ass spinoff that makes no sense to a seven year old like you were trying to show at the

1419
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,720
end of Kingdom Hearts 2, like, remember that?

1420
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
That was awesome.

1421
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,560
It was awesome, but what the fuck did it have to do with Disney?

1422
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,560
Nothing.

1423
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,560
Show me...

1424
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,120
What does Kingdom Hearts really have to do with Disney?

1425
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,160
Not a lot, but dammit, it gives me something to look forward to.

1426
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,440
I'm surprised we haven't seen anything Kingdom Hearts related in Disneyland.

1427
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:02,400
Well, that's a whole nother story, because technically it's licensed, it's not a part

1428
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,640
of Disney, so you don't really see, I mean, but in Japan, apparently they have more, and

1429
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:12,360
I'll tell you what, one time, I think I told this on the show, one trip I took to Disneyland,

1430
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,960
was it with you, Darkseid, or was it...

1431
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,960
I don't remember when it was.

1432
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,600
I don't remember if it was this March or if it was last, the time before, but we actually

1433
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,320
saw a little kid dressed up as Sora.

1434
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,320
Yeah, we did.

1435
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,320
In the park.

1436
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,320
In a haunted mansion.

1437
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,320
I thought I was with you.

1438
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,040
We saw him in line for a haunted mansion, so sometimes you see it, you know, I don't

1439
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,720
know, but it's just, you know, random.

1440
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,200
Because remember they were from Australia or something, and the costume was really well

1441
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,200
done.

1442
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,200
That was right.

1443
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,200
And then they asked him to leave.

1444
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,080
No, they didn't ask him, because you're allowed to be dressed up in the park if you're a kid.

1445
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Yep.

1446
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:46,140
So, anyhow, I've ever seen one thing in the park, Kingdom Hearts related, one thing, official

1447
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,700
Disney in the park, and that was a California venture in the collectible store they were

1448
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,920
selling where they sell all the little mini statues, I saw as Sora.

1449
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,760
That's the only thing I've ever seen Kingdom Hearts related.

1450
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,760
Really?

1451
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,760
Yes.

1452
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,760
I haven't seen that at all.

1453
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,760
Yes.

1454
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,760
And it was gone when I looked again this last time I was there.

1455
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:05,000
So, I guess it's kind of like Where's Waldo across two theme parks.

1456
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Where's Sora.

1457
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Where's Sora.

1458
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Good luck.

1459
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,280
Anyhow, more stories, if we could.

1460
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,520
Dark Sakura.

1461
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:19,240
Well, as I mentioned, I believe it was last week, there was the rumor about Wolfenstein

1462
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:26,880
3D coming out, and it is going to be on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

1463
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,360
It will be June 4th and June 5th, respectively.

1464
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,440
That means Xbox fans get it first.

1465
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
Ha ha.

1466
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,240
Bringing it home.

1467
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,240
Huh?

1468
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:40,640
That's part of the E3 is bringing it home, or, you know, where Microsoft does that bringing

1469
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,640
it home thing.

1470
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,640
Oh, okay.

1471
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,640
They have demos.

1472
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:48,240
I bet you anything we're going to see a Lost Planet 2 demo coming this week, since they

1473
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,800
said they were going to do that anyways.

1474
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,160
Maybe I'll get some cool new shirts for my avatar, whoopty shit.

1475
01:08:54,160 --> 01:09:02,120
But there will be, actually, um, of course, achievements, whatever you want to call it.

1476
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:07,520
And also for the new Wolfenstein game, there's going to be, um, you can earn accolades and

1477
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,880
be awarded gold for customizable weapon upgrades for the new Wolfenstein, so that'll be pretty

1478
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
cool.

1479
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,760
And that, of course, is coming out on August 4th.

1480
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,160
No idea on price yet.

1481
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,160
Sorry.

1482
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,160
I don't know.

1483
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,160
It'll probably be 10 bucks.

1484
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,160
They're all 10 bucks.

1485
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,160
I want to shoot Hitler in the head.

1486
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
They're all, I, I...

1487
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,160
It should be five bucks.

1488
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,840
I want to shoot a giant pixelated Hitler.

1489
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:29,400
I mean, Wolfenstein 3D, honestly, I, unless they did something really cool with this,

1490
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,240
which I, you know, I heard about the whole integration with the new Wolfenstein or whatever,

1491
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,000
I'm sorry, that's not enough, unless they did something really fucking cool, like suddenly

1492
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,480
put multiplayer in it somehow, which I doubt they did, I don't think it's worth it, because

1493
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,800
if the game was not that great by today's standards, was it an important and revolutionary

1494
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,380
game at the time, yes, but does it hold up to today's standards?

1495
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:50,380
Hell the fuck no.

1496
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,880
You are going to download this and be, why did I waste $10?

1497
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,120
Remember PUBGAMES Fable 2?

1498
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,680
Remember how that was going to integrate stuff?

1499
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,920
Remember how crappy those were?

1500
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:58,920
Yeah.

1501
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,920
I don't, I'm not falling for that twice.

1502
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,920
Sorry.

1503
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,640
Um, I'm going to get it.

1504
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,480
I love, I freaking love Wolfenstein.

1505
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,640
I love Doom, and I also love Duke Nukem 3D.

1506
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,600
Bought both of those, played them for about, you know, 30 minutes, and then that was it.

1507
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,600
You're like, yay, nostalgia.

1508
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,020
Okay, done now.

1509
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,720
I will, I will bet money.

1510
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,160
I will bet money Dark Soccer does the same thing.

1511
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,200
She'll buy it, play it for 30 minutes, and be done.

1512
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,800
No, that is if I actually go through with buying it.

1513
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,800
And it's nothing against, I'm just saying, it's the same thing, the same nostalgia bug,

1514
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,000
the same nostalgia bug that, that, that you and me.

1515
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,120
Honestly, honestly, honestly, this is really what I'm going to do is probably just freaking

1516
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,160
download it and play it on my computer like, you know, God intended.

1517
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,080
Marissa Cunguso in chat says, anyone remember Heretic?

1518
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,400
Hell yeah, I'm sorry, I was the big Hexen fan.

1519
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:55,160
Now if, if that and Hexen come out on Xbox Live, we will play that for hours, guaranteed.

1520
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,440
We'll just, we will stream it on the internet to prove it.

1521
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,400
I will go on leave from work and play it.

1522
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,760
We will play like eight, eight hours of that game on a weekend.

1523
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,800
We will, we will do it.

1524
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,320
I will watch Rob do it too.

1525
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,200
Gee, thanks.

1526
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,200
You're a real pal.

1527
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,200
No, I will.

1528
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,200
I'd play.

1529
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,200
I'd do it.

1530
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,200
All right, good.

1531
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,200
Cause I might want to like sleep at some point or eat.

1532
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,200
I don't know.

1533
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,200
During those eight hours.

1534
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
You're not allowed to eat anymore, Rob.

1535
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,040
If you release what Heretic or Hexen or both or which one?

1536
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,080
They should do a pack.

1537
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,040
All right, so if Heretic and Hexen come out on Xbox Live Arcade, Dark Soccer and I will

1538
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,560
do an eight hour marathon.

1539
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,560
We will.

1540
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,560
We will.

1541
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,200
No, we will do a 24 hour marathon.

1542
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,200
No.

1543
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,200
Yes.

1544
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,960
We will do the Uber marathon.

1545
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,160
Is there enough gameplay to last for 24 hours?

1546
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,160
I guess.

1547
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,160
We'll find a way.

1548
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,160
All right.

1549
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,160
Isn't there like multiple episodes or something?

1550
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,160
All right.

1551
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:51,680
Look, there are too many bets being made tonight and I'm really afraid, I'm really afraid the

1552
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,280
public is going to win one of them.

1553
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,560
So you know what, Rob, you know what my, my thought is on bets?

1554
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,560
What?

1555
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:00,240
I never intend on going through with them, so why?

1556
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,240
You're a bad bet maker.

1557
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,160
I fully intended on going through with the Eye of Judgment thing.

1558
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:09,400
If somebody says, Hey, we heard about this bet, we just sold another 750,000 copies of

1559
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,040
it, which will never happen.

1560
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,900
But if it did, then yes, I would go through with the bet.

1561
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,480
He would have done it and it would have, you wouldn't have half asked it either.

1562
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,400
It would have been to the wife would have made the costume.

1563
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,520
It would have been tremendous things that could have been, but no, nobody had to buy

1564
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,520
Eye of Judgment.

1565
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,440
We're even going to have him go through the happy tingle dance.

1566
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,640
When Loki makes the bet, he makes the damn bet.

1567
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,640
He's a man.

1568
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,640
I will say this.

1569
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,760
I was done the show with Loki a long time, known the man many years.

1570
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,120
He is a man of his word.

1571
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,840
And God forbid they try to make a sequel.

1572
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,720
And no, I don't think I will, I don't know whether, we'll have to look at this.

1573
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:48,000
Yeah, it depends whether you don't say anything until you see, because the sequel could be

1574
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,480
cool if there is one.

1575
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,680
So you want to just, you want to watch it, Loki.

1576
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,840
Watch it.

1577
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,640
Something that probably will be cool, but I won't be picking it up.

1578
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,640
Guitar Hero 5.

1579
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,440
It will be coming out a little bit earlier this year, September 1st.

1580
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,640
And of course, you know, new to Guitar Hero 5 will be a new party play mode where you

1581
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,280
mix up what instruments you have.

1582
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,980
And also, you know, kind of, I think drop in and drop out play as well, which is kind

1583
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,520
of sweet.

1584
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,800
And there's also a confirmation, a full confirmation of all the artists that will be featured in

1585
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,120
the game.

1586
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,840
And actually a pretty long list.

1587
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:30,280
Even there's some that I wouldn't have thought would normally be in, in like Guitar Hero.

1588
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:33,900
Like we had the Gorillaz, which was in there, confirmed.

1589
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,440
I mean, that's, do they have any really guitar friendly songs?

1590
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,280
Well, yeah.

1591
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:53,040
I mean, let's see here, Blur, Blink-182, Iron Maiden, Duran Duran, Tom Petty, Nirvana, Smashing

1592
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,920
Pumpkins, David Bowie, Johnny Cash.

1593
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:03,880
One that made me excited, Rammstein is going to be in there, Beck, Garbage, Billy Idol,

1594
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:04,880
finally.

1595
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,880
One that made me perk up.

1596
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,880
I love Garbage.

1597
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,880
Queen and David Bowie.

1598
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,880
Okay.

1599
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,880
Oh.

1600
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,880
That means you're getting under pressure.

1601
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,880
Under pressure?

1602
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
Probably.

1603
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
Oh.

1604
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,480
I just bought Guitar Hero 5, son of a bitch.

1605
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,480
Son of a bitch.

1606
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,660
That's like the one song I have to have.

1607
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,660
You all know it.

1608
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,660
You out there listening.

1609
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:26,680
You know there is that one song you have to have if you haven't already got it.

1610
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:30,460
There's that one song you have to have that's going to make you buy the game regardless.

1611
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,460
And he just said it.

1612
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,460
Elton John.

1613
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:39,800
Oh man, there's like, I don't know, it looks pretty cool in deep purple.

1614
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,160
So maybe we'll get Highway Star in there again.

1615
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,960
I love Highway Star.

1616
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,960
Alright.

1617
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,960
Sweet.

1618
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,760
And that's just a selection of some of the stuff there, but they have the full list that's

1619
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:48,760
out there now.

1620
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:54,920
Apparently it was leaked out by a UK magazine, I believe the UK equivalent to like Rolling

1621
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,720
Stone or something posted the full list.

1622
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,800
But we'll hear more about Guitar Hero 5 and you'll actually get to see it.

1623
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,200
In a few days.

1624
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,600
Alright well we got just a little more news for you and then we're going to get to the

1625
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,440
classic game of the week and this has to do with Nintendo.

1626
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,000
Now the leaks aren't just kept to Sony.

1627
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,480
Nintendo might have leaked some things out thanks to some trademarks they've been filing.

1628
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,600
One of the trademarks that have been filed, Wii Fit Plus.

1629
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,560
Now here's the thing, apparently this was already found out a few months ago through

1630
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,560
some retailer listings, but now this title has officially been trademarked in Japan.

1631
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:32,440
There's also a logo to go with it, so you know what?

1632
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,840
This is probably something you're going to see at E3.

1633
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:42,960
In fact, apparently some news leaks have come out of E3 that apparently yes, Wii Fit Plus

1634
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,480
is a real deal.

1635
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,160
Wii Motion Plus is going to be supported.

1636
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,260
That's a big part of this game is that now they'll be able to detect the motion a little

1637
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:54,040
better and it's going to have online functionality.

1638
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:55,800
Very limited online functionality.

1639
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,440
This is probably just sharing data across the internet so you can motivate each other.

1640
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,600
Which is okay.

1641
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,400
It's not something to buy the game over, but I got to be honest, I think a lot of people

1642
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:11,580
give Wii Fit a really hard time because we're core gamers, but if you look at this from

1643
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:17,880
the perspective of it gets people up off the couch and it's not boring.

1644
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,000
I was playing Wii Fit religiously for a couple weeks.

1645
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,760
I really need to get back into doing it.

1646
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,320
I fell out of the habit and I shouldn't have done that.

1647
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:28,440
Next to going to a gym, it's not a bad thing.

1648
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,320
I got to say, I'm very interested in Wii Fit Plus.

1649
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,000
As embarrassed as I am to say it, I'm interested to see what they do with it.

1650
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,240
I know, and that's kind of cool that they're putting out another game that some of these

1651
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:43,680
people that bought Wii Fit are going to buy, but they just keep putting out sequels to

1652
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,920
games that they already have.

1653
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:50,580
Yes, I know that everybody releases sequels, but my god, okay, seriously, let's see here.

1654
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,420
Wii Sports Resort.

1655
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:57,020
Wii Sports 2 basically, which has games that repeat themselves.

1656
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,020
Hold up though.

1657
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:02,160
Wii Sports, like if it's not the top selling console game of all time at this point, one

1658
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,160
of the top.

1659
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,160
Come on.

1660
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,160
Give them.

1661
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,160
They've got to have a Wii Sports 2.

1662
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,700
That may be true.

1663
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:10,920
You know there's going to be a Mario, which by the way, next part of the story, rumor

1664
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,520
is the Mario is the big unveiling at E3, the new Mario game.

1665
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,480
Why aren't we seeing anything new?

1666
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,480
Anything innovative?

1667
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,400
It's basically just rehashes of old stuff.

1668
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,520
Because rehashes are what people want to see.

1669
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,520
Guess what?

1670
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,560
We could have had more motion sensors, but we were cheap and decided not to put in there,

1671
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,760
but hey, now if you buy this, buy more accessories that we're going to sell you now, you can

1672
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,260
buy the same game again with now some online functionality, which should have been in there

1673
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:42,360
in the first place, and you can have some enhanced motion capturing that should have

1674
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,520
been in there in the first place.

1675
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,680
Awesome.

1676
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,760
I get to pay for your mistakes.

1677
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,760
Again.

1678
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:53,000
Oh wait, no, I don't have to because I'm not buying it.

1679
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Comments from chat.

1680
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Chat.orensondrader.com.

1681
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Tell us what you really feel.

1682
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,720
Entertainment says next year they'll have Wii Fit++ with Wii Motion Plus, Wii Vision

1683
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,360
Plus and Wii Internet Plus.

1684
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,920
Marissa Congusto says, I refer back to my old comment that video games are turning into

1685
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,660
porns with multiple sequels and endless sequel numbers.

1686
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:10,560
Same content, different cast.

1687
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:16,080
INGN0, I think Ingo I can say, I'm not sure if there's a pronunciation of that and I forgot

1688
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,080
it.

1689
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,080
Sorry.

1690
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:24,240
The only non-Nintendo game that is good on the Wii is Mad World.

1691
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,960
By the way, one other thing I wanted to say, one other game that was trademarked by Nintendo,

1692
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,960
Art Academy.

1693
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,000
So, maybe that's something new.

1694
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Question mark.

1695
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Hope it's Mario Paint 2.

1696
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
That would be cool.

1697
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Okay, well wait a minute!

1698
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,440
You just said you didn't want to see sequels, and now you're like, give me Mario Paint 2!

1699
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,020
That would be new though, okay?

1700
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:43,020
That would be new.

1701
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,120
They could do more innovative stuff with Mario Paint 2.

1702
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:50,240
Now if they just put Mario Paint, new Wii control, you know, Mario Paint or whatever,

1703
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:55,280
with the Wii controls now to the old game, then yes, that would be rehash crap.

1704
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:00,200
But this is basically Wii Fit, you know, maybe they'll have some different mini games in

1705
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,200
there.

1706
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,200
Whoopee!

1707
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,200
You know?

1708
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,720
And they're gonna just, you know, throw it back at the consumer again.

1709
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,720
And guess what?

1710
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:12,360
The Nintendo consumer's dumb enough to buy this stuff again, and so the cycle will never

1711
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,560
end, and the people who actually want to play good games on the system will never get to

1712
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,680
play those good games.

1713
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,180
So you know what?

1714
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,680
You just have to move on.

1715
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,680
Which I have.

1716
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:27,560
Rama in chat says, with all these motion controller adapters, it's just a matter of time before

1717
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,560
we see masturbation in the game.

1718
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:33,400
And that is what we're hoping to see from the Korean developers at E3, and damn it,

1719
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,400
if masturbation in the game is at E3, OLR will bring it to you, because no one else

1720
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,400
will.

1721
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,800
No one else will want to.

1722
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,000
No one else will want to touch it, literally.

1723
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,560
Fanboy wank the game!

1724
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,840
We did play 3 Feel that one time.

1725
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:55,320
I, we did, we extensively covered 3 Feel on this show, and what the hell ever happened

1726
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,320
to that game?

1727
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,800
That's what I love about E3, I'll play all these games, I will never fucking see them.

1728
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:03,520
Whatever happened to that one game that was like a 360 game about some guy that was like

1729
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,640
Spring Break or something, you can go on panty raids and stuff like that.

1730
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,600
Remember, whatever happened to that?

1731
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,600
I don't know.

1732
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,600
You know what did come out?

1733
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,600
Tulip came out.

1734
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,800
Tulip did come out, finally.

1735
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,800
The smooching game.

1736
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,800
After like two years.

1737
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,800
And X-Tango!

1738
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,840
Still no X-Tango.

1739
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,840
We need an X-Tango!

1740
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,840
I'm sorry.

1741
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,840
That game had so much potential.

1742
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,800
We should go hold these people down and go, why the hell haven't you released your game,

1743
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,800
you lazy bastard?

1744
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,120
Give me some X-Tango or I'll smack you down.

1745
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,120
Hey, look.

1746
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1747
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,120
Hold on, guys.

1748
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,120
Hold on.

1749
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,120
Serious moment here.

1750
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,280
The reality of the situation is none of those games could get picked up because the fact

1751
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,720
people are wanting their Mario 2s and people are wanting more of the same thing.

1752
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,840
The, the, the, serious guys.

1753
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,720
That's why these games fizzled because they couldn't get the backing.

1754
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,840
No they could have put out an Xbox Live Arcade.

1755
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,840
They could easily do that.

1756
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,840
They weren't XNA.

1757
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,240
Well, define easily.

1758
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,000
The money dries up at some point.

1759
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Who's paying for it?

1760
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
The game's done.

1761
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Just port it.

1762
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
They just need a distributor.

1763
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,060
Somebody has to port it.

1764
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,400
You have to pay someone to port it.

1765
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,200
It's not just Presto Chainjo.

1766
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,200
It's on Xbox Live.

1767
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,200
Yes it is.

1768
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,200
There are small game publishers out there that will do that.

1769
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:08,360
I mean, there, there's people picking up rights to like M&Ms and fucking Jelly Belly and stuff

1770
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,880
because they think that's an awesome IP.

1771
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,880
Oh my god, it's recognizable.

1772
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,960
Because people buy that shit.

1773
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:18,360
I mean, if I put out a game that was like Nabisco something or other, I mean, no one's

1774
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,760
gonna pick that up.

1775
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:25,960
Lego My Eggo, you know, the game, I mean, Nabisco presents X-Tango.

1776
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,200
I would pay, I would play Nabisco presents X-Tango.

1777
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,360
You know, it's like, uh, Dancing for Oreos.

1778
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,560
I would play Cookie Dancing the game.

1779
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,960
Purina Dogchow presents, you know, it's like, oh great, X-Alpo.

1780
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,960
X-Alpo.

1781
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,920
Anyways, I'm gonna look and see what happened to 3-Feel.

1782
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,920
Please do.

1783
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,280
I want you, will you do that during the break?

1784
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,280
Will you try to research?

1785
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:55,240
I want to find out what happened to 3-Feel, X-Tango, and uh, what was the other one?

1786
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,960
Anything, anything that we've talked about from the old Kinsha Hall's day, because it's

1787
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,440
been like three years since we've been to an E3 because we didn't get invited the hotel

1788
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,440
years.

1789
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,440
So the years that don't count.

1790
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,440
All right.

1791
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,600
Look, we got, uh, the classic game of the week we got to get to.

1792
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,520
We got to find out what's happened to some really old games.

1793
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,520
Really old?

1794
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,520
How old is really old?

1795
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,520
Dark, I don't know.

1796
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
I guess it's all relative.

1797
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:18,640
Dark Sakura is going to dig through her archive of games and find a game to highlight just

1798
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,440
for you guys and what the heck is going on with it.

1799
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,160
It's called the classic game of the week.

1800
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,760
Here it is here on Orange Launch Radio.

1801
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,800
What is the classic game of the week that all the kids should be playing, Dark Sakura?

1802
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,520
The classic game of the week is, I'm actually going into the arcade archives.

1803
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,440
Even though there were home releases of this, I'm gonna really focus on the arcade version,

1804
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:41,320
and that's a game called Star Blade.

1805
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:53,000
And yeah, I put up our customary, you know, audio thing, but for when it came out, that's

1806
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,600
a pretty good audio.

1807
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:07,800
So this particular game was in a special pod cabinet put out by Namco, and it was running

1808
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,320
on the Namco System 21 hardware at the time.

1809
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:18,040
This game came out when I think I was still in, yeah I was still in high school, it came

1810
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,480
out in 1991, and I was all over this game.

1811
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:29,320
My dollar theater had it, and the guys there used to put it on free play for me.

1812
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,720
So I have beaten Star Blade a number of times.

1813
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:39,320
But the way that it goes is you have a really large 2-axis 4-button controller with an LED

1814
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,320
lamp.

1815
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,520
So basically, you flash it as you shoot them.

1816
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:52,760
When you get hit, the seat rumbles and you get strobes going off, so that it would be

1817
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:58,080
like you actually saw the lasers hitting you, you'd be temporarily blinded, you know, just

1818
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,160
like you would with a photo flash.

1819
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:10,360
It also had a 30 VDC motor that had an asymmetrical axis, so the seating effect, the shaking would

1820
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,480
be really random, it was on three cylinders.

1821
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,880
But yeah, it is a shoot-em-up game.

1822
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,960
You are flying out through space and you're shooting all the bad guys.

1823
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:27,560
They have big flashing red sections kind of like it did in Star Fox.

1824
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:32,480
But basically, you just go around and just shoot stuff.

1825
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,480
It's a lot of fun.

1826
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,760
It's a lot, a lot of fun.

1827
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,180
Really kind of a difficult game, too.

1828
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:42,880
This kind of looks very Star Wars-ish to me, like the Star Wars arcade game that they had

1829
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,600
out looks a little bit like it.

1830
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,680
It just kind of reminds me of it, the way it's set up.

1831
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,680
A little bit.

1832
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,360
There's actually got some more interesting stuff to it, though.

1833
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:55,840
Just to go into the sound, it actually had this four-speaker surround sound, even though

1834
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:02,720
it was only two-channel, they had it to where it would go through four speakers, so it was

1835
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,720
pretty cool.

1836
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:13,400
Now, this is the fun thing, is that we got this on Sega CD and 3DO in 1994 in its original

1837
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,880
way it looked.

1838
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:23,160
However, on PlayStation we got Starblade Alpha, which had a textured mode.

1839
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,000
You could play it with textures or whatever.

1840
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,320
Before it was just like, you know, basic.

1841
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,320
Very Star Fox.

1842
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,320
Imagine Star Fox.

1843
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,320
That's what the graphics look like.

1844
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:32,320
I know we're radio.

1845
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,320
Imagine Star Fox.

1846
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,320
Thank you, Cleaner.

1847
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,320
Yeah.

1848
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,320
You know.

1849
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,280
But it's a really fantastic game.

1850
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:45,120
Now here's the fun thing about it, it actually had another incarnation called Galaxian 3

1851
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,120
Project Dragoon.

1852
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,840
Do you remember anything about that?

1853
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,280
No, but I wanted to say really quick.

1854
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,320
No wonder we go in the big room and play it.

1855
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,920
I can see this game's influence on Star Fox.

1856
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,600
This game looks a lot like Star Fox to me.

1857
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,360
Like it's a mix of Star Wars the arcade game and Star Fox.

1858
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,320
I never played this game back in the day, but it looks a lot like it.

1859
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:09,400
Like just the graphics, the way things flash that you are supposed to target and kill.

1860
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,400
Wow.

1861
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:18,080
Well, Galaxian 3 is a walk-in style game that runs off a laserdisc and the arcade hardware,

1862
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,440
so it has some pre-rendered stuff going on in the background.

1863
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,240
It's super awesome, too.

1864
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:28,760
But it was out for Namco's Theater 6 arcade system, which the only other game that came

1865
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,520
out was Attack of the Zul'gir.

1866
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,360
The cool thing about this, though, is that actually a lot of the audio from Star Blade

1867
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,680
made it into Galaxian 3.

1868
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:45,240
The path of the game is almost identical, you know, through the asteroid field with

1869
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:50,040
battleships going through the planet, desert canyons, blah, blah, blah.

1870
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,520
And the music in it was a rearrangement of Star Blade.

1871
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,000
So Star Blade led directly to Galaxian 3.

1872
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,440
It's a predecessor.

1873
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:10,560
Also, do you know how Tekken 5 had their loading screens that had different games?

1874
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,540
Star Blade was in Tekken 5, so that always made me go for it.

1875
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:17,400
Someone in chat actually recognized that, too.

1876
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,880
And it was unlockable in the arcade history area of the game.

1877
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:26,840
And Star Blade also shows up in Ridge Racer 7 as a wheels manufacturer, so it has wheels

1878
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,840
from the game.

1879
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:35,680
There was supposed to be a sequel to it that was called Star Blade Operation Blue Planet,

1880
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,960
but the game never made production.

1881
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:46,720
It was supposed to be running on the Namco Orbs cabinet with a projector and a slide-in

1882
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,440
scene and everything, so it was supposed to be pretty neat.

1883
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:54,280
But it never happened, which is a damn shame, fie!

1884
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,720
But that's totally my game of the week.

1885
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:02,520
Alright, there you have it, your classic game of the week, Star Blade, on the arcade.

1886
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:07,040
I'm sorry, that's a game that still, I think, holds solid today.

1887
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,440
It may look a little dated, but if you can find one in the cabinet, plunk the money into

1888
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,880
it, it's well worth it.

1889
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,880
Alright.

1890
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,080
It's a very well-received pick by the chat room as well, a lot of fans of that game in

1891
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,080
chat.

1892
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,720
It is seriously, for arcade games, it's one of my favorites.

1893
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,720
Alright.

1894
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,800
Well, we are going to take a quick break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1895
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,760
I need to rest my voice, I need to get some more tea or something hot to drink, because

1896
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,920
you can hear I'm getting the whole puberty thing going on again.

1897
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,920
I have tons of tea.

1898
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,120
And we're going to rest a little bit, our voices, take a quick break, come back in Part

1899
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:38,120
B. We haven't even touched Microsoft News yet, and believe me, there's a lot of it,

1900
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,120
so we're going to get to that after the break.

1901
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,760
And of course, your call's a little later on.

1902
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:44,160
It's probably going to be a bit of a long show tonight, so buckle up and hold on.

1903
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,800
We'll get through it together, guys.

1904
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:55,720
We'll be back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1905
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:59,280
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the

1906
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:04,180
31st of 2009, where we are taping live on All Games Radio, as we do every Sunday night.

1907
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:08,280
The fun begins around 6 o'clock Pacific, but sometimes we're on the phone with Bobby Blackwolf,

1908
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:12,080
the guy who goes before us with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, and it will cause

1909
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,360
us to start a little late, is what happened tonight.

1910
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:15,360
But that's OK.

1911
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,480
We've still got plenty of stuff to talk to you guys about, so let's get right back into

1912
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,480
it.

1913
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,480
Enough BS.

1914
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,240
Hopefully, you've already heard Part A. I don't know why you would.

1915
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,160
I guess maybe if you're joining us late here live on this Sunday evening, then shame on

1916
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,840
you for missing Part A, but you missed a lot about Sony and Nintendo.

1917
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,240
Now we're going to get into Microsoft News, right, Logie?

1918
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,240
Yes.

1919
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,520
The rumored Zune HD is real.

1920
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:44,600
Microsoft has now officially unveiled it, and what it will do is also tie the Zune Marketplace

1921
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,400
into the Xbox 360, which is going to be pretty cool.

1922
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:55,680
They're actually planning on mainly adding, I think, the music portion of the Zune Marketplace,

1923
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:03,200
perhaps showing you how to buy the Zune Pass and stuff like that, so you can download songs.

1924
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:08,960
Also they're going to have, you know, maybe a different music service on top of that that's

1925
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:14,520
going to be similar to the Zune Marketplace for the 360, which is kind of cool.

1926
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:18,080
And the system itself actually looks pretty, like, sleeker.

1927
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,080
I don't know.

1928
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,680
It looks kind of neat, and a lot bigger screen.

1929
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,680
I don't know.

1930
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,680
It's pretty cool.

1931
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,440
I'm sure they're going to show a little bit, I mean, even though it's not really gaming,

1932
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:35,560
they may show a little bit more of it during a Microsoft press conference tomorrow, but

1933
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,560
I don't know.

1934
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,560
It looks kind of cool.

1935
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,560
I kind of want to get one.

1936
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,560
Really?

1937
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:44,560
Maybe.

1938
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,560
I don't know.

1939
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,080
I have my new stereo in the car.

1940
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:52,760
This is interesting, though, from you, because you usually are not a big portable person.

1941
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:56,440
I know you have a lot of iPhone hate, but it would be interesting to see you get the

1942
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,480
Zune out of all this.

1943
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,360
What is it about this that makes you excited?

1944
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:09,080
Well, apparently they're going to integrate the Zune into Xbox Live, creating a game-changing

1945
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:13,560
entertainment experience, as they say, but that could be just a whole bunch of PR fluff.

1946
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,560
I don't know.

1947
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,280
I have to see what functions they're actually going to do.

1948
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,800
Remember, they were talking back before that they're going to have X and A games available

1949
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,400
to play on the Zune, so that might be kind of cool.

1950
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,400
I don't know.

1951
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,400
We'll see.

1952
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,520
I probably won't end up actually getting one, but it would be neat to see what they're going

1953
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,640
to offer for it.

1954
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:30,640
All right.

1955
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:36,000
Well, I guess we will see what happens as more is revealed on the Zune HD.

1956
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,980
I'm sure this is going to be one of the big things at Microsoft's press conference, which

1957
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:44,600
is weird, though, because this is not necessarily games unless they're going to be talking about

1958
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,880
the gaming aspect of it, right?

1959
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:47,880
Probably, yeah.

1960
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,880
I hope it's something.

1961
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,880
Yeah.

1962
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,640
Well, I'm sure they've got lots of stuff in here to compete with.

1963
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:59,200
I'm sure they're going to try to do something like X and A for the Zune.

1964
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,680
It only makes sense because they'd be competing with Apple in that sense, because they're

1965
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:12,840
going to have a marketplace that has applications and games similar to the Apple App Store.

1966
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,600
Most importantly, however, will it blend?

1967
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,600
That's the big question.

1968
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:17,600
Always blends.

1969
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,600
That's right.

1970
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,600
All right.

1971
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,080
Well, hey, Microsoft might be up to something else.

1972
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:25,680
Apparently, there's some ads out there on Microsoft's careers site.

1973
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,480
If you want to get a job with Microsoft, you can go to this website and look for possible

1974
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:30,480
careers.

1975
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,800
Apparently, one thing they are looking for right now, an engineer that will be working

1976
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:37,640
on a game to support up to 300,000 players in real time.

1977
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:38,640
No way.

1978
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,000
Apparently, Microsoft is building an extremely high-performance system to extend console

1979
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,640
games to the server in new ways, creating a completely new set of web services.

1980
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:50,440
What's interesting about it, when I first looked at this, I was like, oh, big deal.

1981
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,960
It's probably a computer game or something else.

1982
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,440
But no, apparently, it is something that is going to be integrating into the console.

1983
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,840
Could this be for some type of future NXC enhancement with all the avatars and what

1984
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:01,840
have you?

1985
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,240
What with all this now 1 versus 100 and all these live things, maybe they are looking

1986
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,600
for something massive.

1987
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,600
Who knows?

1988
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:12,280
Or are they building some competition for PlayStation Home?

1989
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,100
That could be.

1990
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,600
Or is it a little bit of both?

1991
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,600
Who knows?

1992
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,600
Could be very interesting.

1993
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,400
I don't really know why they would need to make competition for PlayStation Home.

1994
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,400
I don't think...

1995
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,400
I don't know.

1996
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:27,760
Well, maybe they will do the things that Sony should have done with Home.

1997
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,320
You know, Sony has kind of been a lot of big talk.

1998
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,560
They've been talking about how you're going to launch games from within Home.

1999
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,880
They've been talking about that trophy room where you're going to show off all your trophies.

2000
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,880
Yet, we have yet to see all of that.

2001
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,360
I mean, I guess they do have the launching of the games now built in.

2002
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,780
But I got to be honest, it's a little clunky.

2003
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:47,400
And how many people do you honestly know that are going to sit down at the Sony PlayStation

2004
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,480
and go, okay, I'm going to go into Home to launch this game, right?

2005
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:55,400
Nobody really does that, except maybe the one time to check out how it works.

2006
01:33:55,400 --> 01:34:01,940
You know, there isn't a lot of draw in Home to make that the place I start my gaming experience

2007
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:02,980
right now.

2008
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:06,880
Maybe Microsoft, if they build this into a future NXC, is going to make something like

2009
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,120
Home the place to start your gaming experience.

2010
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:12,680
Well, they're going to have to do a lot.

2011
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:20,040
Well, Son of Dad in our chatroom at chat.orangelandraday.com suggests XBLA announces Uno clusterfuck.

2012
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,200
And Act Def says, I would play Uno clusterfuck.

2013
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,040
I would check out Uno clusterfuck.

2014
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,360
I would play Uno clusterfuck.

2015
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,800
I could be with 300,000 people all at once.

2016
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,960
Draw four, bitches.

2017
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:31,960
I could see that.

2018
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:32,960
Uno clusterfuck.

2019
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,000
That'd be fun.

2020
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,160
So we'll see what happens.

2021
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,720
I doubt this will be an announcement at E3 this year anyway.

2022
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,720
Maybe next year.

2023
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,720
Who knows?

2024
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,720
Oh, maybe.

2025
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,720
Well, how about some other stuff though?

2026
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:45,720
How about it?

2027
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:46,720
How about betas?

2028
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,720
Beta, beta, betas.

2029
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:50,760
Aw, I thought you couldn't get those anymore.

2030
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,040
It was all VHS now.

2031
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:55,320
But I'm pumped.

2032
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:58,760
This was me blinking at Rob.

2033
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,880
There was the one versus 100 beta.

2034
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,460
It was going on in Canada.

2035
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:05,760
Or as some people say, Canadian.

2036
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,200
I say Canada.

2037
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:12,320
It is supposed to be though coming to America as of June 1st.

2038
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,680
So if anyone cares, there you go.

2039
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:18,560
Microsoft's bringing it home, beta style.

2040
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,640
And all of us that are traveling to E3 won't get a chance to play this really unless we

2041
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,040
bring our Xboxes with us.

2042
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,040
So which I'm not.

2043
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,880
I suppose I could try playing it.

2044
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:29,400
Yeah, but weren't you asking me before the show, what the hell is this?

2045
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,280
I've been hearing about it and honestly, I was like, I don't care.

2046
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,800
But have you ever seen the game show?

2047
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,240
No, I don't want TV.

2048
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:36,240
Because it wasn't that great.

2049
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,920
I mean, for one, it wasn't that great.

2050
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,260
But if you heard a lot of good things about it, would you watch it maybe?

2051
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:43,260
Check it out?

2052
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,260
No.

2053
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:45,260
You didn't have that hose with us.

2054
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:46,260
He's not doing anything.

2055
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:47,360
He just goes to E3.

2056
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:51,520
But I mean, I think we can all agree the idea, this whole idea, despite the fact that the

2057
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,860
game show itself might not have been that much fun to watch, to actually get to play

2058
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:57,840
it on Xbox Live might be kind of cool.

2059
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,720
I know I'm looking forward to it.

2060
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,440
I didn't sneak into the Canada beta or anything.

2061
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,080
I heard about all these people sneaking in.

2062
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,660
I'm just like, big effing deal.

2063
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,960
You can wait a couple weeks, right?

2064
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,120
I would like to quote a line from Wayne's World.

2065
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,120
Yes.

2066
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,720
Monkeys might fly out of my butt.

2067
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,680
So you don't see yourself playing it?

2068
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,680
No.

2069
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,680
Nah.

2070
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:19,180
Redertainment says, am I only going to be able to play 1 versus 100 only at a set time

2071
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,180
during the day?

2072
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,180
Yeah.

2073
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:22,560
I think that's how I understand it's set up, right?

2074
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,560
Like, they have showtimes.

2075
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,600
But I think it's not like they only let 101 people in.

2076
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,680
No, it's people in the audience.

2077
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:33,500
There's also the actual mob, which is 100 people.

2078
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,320
And then there's the player.

2079
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:36,520
Interesting.

2080
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,720
So I would have thought maybe they have 30 different games, but they're all going at

2081
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,960
the same time.

2082
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,520
That way everybody gets to be in the mob.

2083
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,160
But they're not going to do it that way, huh?

2084
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:47,040
No, it doesn't quite work like that.

2085
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,840
I think you have to register or something.

2086
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:51,620
Well, that sucks.

2087
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,720
What if I want to actually get to play the game?

2088
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,720
Fat chance, right?

2089
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:55,720
No!

2090
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,720
You will not.

2091
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,080
This is where the 300,000 comes in.

2092
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:03,600
Son of Dad says, only good thing about 1 versus 100 is Bob Saget, who will not be a part of

2093
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,600
this.

2094
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,920
Black Wolf is correcting us, saying no registration.

2095
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,520
The reason there's a showtime is because there's a live host who conducts interviews.

2096
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:13,520
That's kind of cool.

2097
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,520
Screw the live host.

2098
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,520
We don't need a live host.

2099
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,520
Well, I mean, no.

2100
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,520
I like the idea of a live host.

2101
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,520
I just kind of thought...

2102
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,520
I don't know.

2103
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,520
I thought...

2104
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,520
Just outsource it to India.

2105
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,520
...to a conference.

2106
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,520
Oh, God.

2107
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:24,520
So we can have it 24 hours.

2108
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,520
We can do a match.

2109
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,520
Wow.

2110
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:30,160
I don't know who you are anymore.

2111
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:34,440
But I would have thought maybe there'd be like 30 games going on at once.

2112
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:38,440
And Black Wolf says they are going to have other games during the week where you are

2113
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,400
in an automated game as you play those.

2114
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,400
So OK.

2115
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,160
So they'll have like their big live event and then some other games throughout the week.

2116
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:47,160
I don't know.

2117
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:49,380
I'm curious to see how this all comes together.

2118
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:52,800
That still earns me the who cares award of the week.

2119
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,800
I'd care.

2120
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:54,800
I'm a big fan of game shows.

2121
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,800
You know what?

2122
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,800
I want to check this out.

2123
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,800
I would be all over what?

2124
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:58,920
Prime Time Survivor.

2125
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,880
I would be all over that game, tooth and nail, playing Prime Time Survivor.

2126
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,880
I hope that's the next game.

2127
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,960
Or was it the Amazing Race?

2128
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:06,960
Any of those games.

2129
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,880
Although I don't know how you play the Amazing Race on Xbox.

2130
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:10,880
I don't think that would work.

2131
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:11,880
Tap A to run.

2132
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,880
Tap A to be amazing.

2133
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,880
All right.

2134
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:16,880
Anyhow.

2135
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:23,960
Well, you know, 1 versus 100 still weighs off from actually coming out.

2136
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:28,520
But Sims 3, that's on its way out later this week.

2137
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:32,280
And already, you know, people have been pirating the hell out of it.

2138
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:37,440
And as with any Sims game, it's only traditional that you get an uncensored patch.

2139
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,760
And that's what they've done.

2140
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:39,760
Boobs.

2141
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:40,760
Boobs patch.

2142
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,240
Before the game has been released, they have taken away the blur.

2143
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:48,840
So now you can see the nipolous, you know, women without their genitalia.

2144
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,200
Well, you know they're going to make new skins, too.

2145
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,200
Exactly.

2146
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,480
That is step 2.

2147
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,480
And then problem.

2148
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,840
Is that a new verb you just invented?

2149
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,840
Nipolous?

2150
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:57,840
The nip...

2151
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,840
The most...

2152
01:38:58,840 --> 01:38:59,840
Nipolous.

2153
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:00,840
The nipolous...

2154
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,840
The most nipolous women.

2155
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:02,840
Oh, nipolous.

2156
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,840
Oh, nipolous.

2157
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,840
Very Barbie-like.

2158
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,840
Oh, nipolous.

2159
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:06,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

2160
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:07,840
I thought you were...

2161
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:08,840
I thought you were using it as...

2162
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:09,840
No, not as...

2163
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,840
To describe somebody.

2164
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:11,840
She was quite nipply.

2165
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,160
That actually is the word that people use, Rob.

2166
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:16,680
Oh, I guess that's true.

2167
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,680
But not to...

2168
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:22,240
And besides, I would not be able to, you know, take credit for that phrase.

2169
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:27,800
I believe Chevy Chase said it a long time ago in Christmas Vacation.

2170
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,080
It's a bit nipply outside.

2171
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,080
Alright, whatever.

2172
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,080
Fine.

2173
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,080
That's true.

2174
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:40,520
So, and then, besides that, The Sims 3, apparently, within the first four days of its online debut,

2175
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,600
it had been downloaded 180,000 times.

2176
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:53,280
And apparently they claim that you are playing a non-final unauthorized copy of The Sims

2177
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,280
3.

2178
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:55,280
Which is crap.

2179
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,280
Which...

2180
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:00,440
Yes, that is absolute crap, because I can tell you right now, retailers have had this

2181
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:03,600
game for two weeks now, so...

2182
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:09,160
It's absolute crap, and what they mean by non-final is that you haven't registered it

2183
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:13,680
so you can't download the other town they have available, Riverview.

2184
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:20,520
And also you get 1,000 sim points that you can buy virtual objects with.

2185
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,440
But you know what, it's only a matter of time before that gets leaked too, so just give

2186
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:26,680
it time.

2187
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:29,640
But I bet there's a lot of people that still want to buy the real deal.

2188
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:33,560
Mark Sakras expressed her interest in just buying it for real.

2189
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,440
Yeah, because you're a Sims fan and you support the developers.

2190
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:41,760
I learned my lesson with buying Spore, so I will not buy The Sims 3.

2191
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:48,120
I probably won't end up playing The Sims 3 either, but yes, Spore will not get any more

2192
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,120
of my money.

2193
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,800
I don't know, I feel like there's so many other games for me to play right now, I don't

2194
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:55,560
know if I can get sucked into The Sims 3, but I'll watch Jamie play it, and if it looks

2195
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:56,560
interesting, I'll buy it.

2196
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:02,000
I only want to kill naked Sims in this game, so you know, I can't see myself actually spending

2197
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,240
money and time to play this game, because all I'm going to do is download the uncensored

2198
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:10,520
patch, download the new skins that make naked Sims, because that's funny for some reason.

2199
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,280
Naked Sim Party, Naked Sim Death Party.

2200
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,280
I have naked Sims.

2201
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:17,760
And you know, the other costumes and skins that they have, like the naked Joker sim,

2202
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:25,080
and you know, just ridiculous stuff, and then just kill them all in really interesting ways.

2203
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:28,840
And that's how I'll spend an evening, and then we're done.

2204
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:30,240
Then I don't play it ever again.

2205
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:33,760
That's what happens in The Sims, and then every now and then I'll go back to it, reinstall

2206
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,520
it, and do it all over again, and then we're done.

2207
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:42,520
So I really don't see a point in me buying this full retail game for this.

2208
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:46,280
I don't care about the other town, I don't need another town to visit to kill The Sims

2209
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,480
in this way.

2210
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:48,480
It's just...

2211
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,080
You don't want to kill The Sims in the other town?

2212
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:54,120
I guess I could, why not, you know, but it's...

2213
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,120
I just don't really care.

2214
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:58,560
Playing Sims right now.

2215
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,560
And totally enjoying it.

2216
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:04,160
Darksharkar, have you ever gone on the Naked Death Spree in The Sims?

2217
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,960
No, not yet, because I told you I'm too busy building houses.

2218
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,280
I was trying to make a haunted house once, and there was another time that the mailman

2219
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:15,360
came and then I trapped them with a mote, and that was funny too because they couldn't

2220
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:21,360
figure out how to leave, and then I killed the mail person by starving them to death.

2221
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:26,380
I would love to see a real absurd Sims-type game.

2222
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,640
Maybe this game exists somewhere, someone will have to tell me.

2223
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:35,240
Like a very absurd Sims-type game or an add-on that is all about the horrific death of your

2224
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,240
Sims.

2225
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,240
Why not?

2226
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,240
They had...

2227
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,480
I don't know if you remember this.

2228
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:45,280
They had a freeware game that someone made called Lammers, and it was a spin-off of Lemmings,

2229
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:50,480
where you had a gun and different weapons, and you shot the Lemmings as they ran across

2230
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:54,720
the street, and they would do like, you know, all the stuff would be AI-driven so they would

2231
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:58,480
be doing the builders and that kind of stuff, but no, you couldn't let them get to the home

2232
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,160
that you had to kill them.

2233
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,640
I would play that.

2234
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:02,640
It was awesome.

2235
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:07,120
I bet it's online somewhere, just look up Lammers, the freeware Lemmings spin-off.

2236
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,680
I hate Lemmings.

2237
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:11,880
Yeah, Lemmings was awesome like ten years ago, but...

2238
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,380
Lemmings reminds me of people I know.

2239
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:19,040
But now like Lemmings, they re-released it for the PSP and the Playstation 3, like it's

2240
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,000
popular all over again or something, I don't know.

2241
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I can't talk.

2242
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,960
I had a fansite for drawings I would do, just because apparently the only thing I could

2243
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,520
draw at one time was Lemmings.

2244
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:36,020
Well, maybe someday something that can be cool again is Sonic, and Sonic, of course,

2245
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:39,440
you know, the last few Sonic games they've put out have been, well, let's just say not

2246
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,000
as great as the old ones.

2247
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,840
Well, who remembers Sonic R?

2248
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:45,160
I love Sonic R!

2249
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,160
Oh my god!

2250
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2251
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:49,120
You don't even understand, okay?

2252
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:50,760
I'm sure it was one of your games of the week before.

2253
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:55,360
Yeah, actually, I think it has been, but I was so, the one thing I was super mad about

2254
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:59,540
Vista is that I couldn't play Sonic R unless I play in compatibility mode, then it fucks

2255
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,720
up my resolution.

2256
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:05,880
Well, the bad news is, this story is not about a Sonic R2 or a Sonic R revival, sorry.

2257
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,480
Ugh, why'd you do that to me for?

2258
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:12,200
But the good news is, they are talking about a new Sonic racing game.

2259
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:15,680
It's called Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing.

2260
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:20,080
Apparently it will be Sonic versus Super Monkey Ball in his little ball.

2261
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:26,280
Samba De Amigo's monkey guy that has the maracas are all going to be in this Sonic racing game.

2262
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,120
However, now they're in vehicles.

2263
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,560
What does this game sound like to you?

2264
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:31,560
No!

2265
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:32,560
They have to run!

2266
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:33,560
What does this game sound like to you?

2267
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:34,560
They have to run!

2268
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,360
Could they, are they going to be in carts by chance?

2269
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,040
Rob, don't do this to me.

2270
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:41,280
Maybe instead of shells they'll throw rings, I don't call it a hunch.

2271
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,760
Rob, don't do this to me!

2272
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:45,800
They actually had a Game Gear game that was in carts.

2273
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:50,400
Well, now to be fair, I am joking a little bit, this game is not going to be all carts.

2274
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:55,020
There's going to be planes and sports cars and bananas.

2275
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,020
That's right, bananas.

2276
01:44:56,020 --> 01:45:00,280
Hey, this game is coming out on the Playstation 3, Xbox 360.

2277
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,640
Did you just say Sonic Butt Monkeys?

2278
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,880
No, Sonic Plus Monkeys.

2279
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:04,880
That's what the game is.

2280
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:05,880
And the DS in 2010.

2281
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,680
I wonder if Ooh La La will be in it.

2282
01:45:08,680 --> 01:45:10,960
I swear you said Sonic Butt Monkeys.

2283
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,920
Instant purchase of Ooh La La's in it.

2284
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:18,800
Well, remember, she was in Sega Superstar Tennis, I believe, so it very well...

2285
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,840
I fucking hate that Sega keeps teasing Ooh La La in front of us, though, like, remember

2286
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,440
Space Channel 5?

2287
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,520
Too bad you're never going to see another one!

2288
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:32,840
I wonder if we're going to have Ooh La La's in it if Space Michael will be in it.

2289
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:33,920
Nope.

2290
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,920
Don't hold your breath.

2291
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:39,880
I like Space Michael, it's the only cool incarnation he's had since, you know, Thriller, when he

2292
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,120
was a zombie.

2293
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,120
Leo Shen agrees with me.

2294
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:45,520
I will only buy this game if Ooh La La is a guest again.

2295
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,520
She was in Riders.

2296
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,800
There you go.

2297
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,640
So we'll see more about this game.

2298
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,640
Who knows?

2299
01:45:51,640 --> 01:45:52,640
Maybe something at E3?

2300
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,640
Question mark?

2301
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:54,640
We will see.

2302
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:57,520
Apparently this game is out in 2010, so they got to show it at some point.

2303
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,240
Let's move on to some more gaming news in the meantime.

2304
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:03,080
This is happy, happy, happy news, and I wonder if my hubby knows about it, which he probably

2305
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,600
does.

2306
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:09,840
Sega is going to be doing downloadable vintage games on Xbox Live Arcade.

2307
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:17,120
Starting off with the, one of the pinnacle of video games, Gunstar Heroes, on June 10th,

2308
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:25,200
and of course the next day it will be out on PlayStation Network, is actually, that's

2309
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:29,040
the only one that's supposed to be coming out on PlayStation Network so far, but there

2310
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:35,600
were seven other titles announced for Xbox Live Arcade, which I think that I've already

2311
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:42,640
covered this, Arcade Shinobi, Comic Zone, Altered Beast, Sonic 3, Phantasy Star 2, Sonic

2312
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:46,880
& Knuckles, and Gunstar Heroes.

2313
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,480
Great except for the fact that I already own that Sega collection.

2314
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:55,800
Do you know how many copies of Gunstar Heroes we have and Gunstar Super Heroes and all versions

2315
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,800
of Gunstar Heroes?

2316
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,400
And let me guess, this will be one more because you need the achievements, right?

2317
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,400
It's Dan.

2318
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:02,400
He'll get it.

2319
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,400
He'll get it.

2320
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:04,400
I know he'll get it.

2321
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,680
Um, Loki found that clip of Lamer's on YouTube that we were talking about earlier.

2322
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,360
I think I've played that game before.

2323
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,760
I think I've played it before.

2324
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:15,760
It looked very familiar to me, but yeah, can you link that in chat?

2325
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,220
I know this does no good for our podcast listeners, but can you at least link it in chat so they

2326
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,840
can kind of see what you're looking at here?

2327
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,600
I just saw the best mashup game, Rob.

2328
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,600
What's that?

2329
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,560
Mashup game of the week, Worms and Lemmings.

2330
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:30,200
Wait, is this a real game or something you want to exist?

2331
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:33,740
I'm gonna start my mashup game of the week.

2332
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:34,740
That's a lot.

2333
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:35,740
Mashup game.

2334
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:36,740
All right.

2335
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:37,800
It is Worms and Lemmings.

2336
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,680
Imagine your Lemmings are running around and you blow them up with the...

2337
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,680
That's what this is.

2338
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:42,680
Look at this.

2339
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,680
Well, no.

2340
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:49,440
You actually, they wage war on each other and your Lemmings are your innocent bystanders.

2341
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,080
I remember an old-ass PC game.

2342
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,920
I'm going on a tangent here, but I don't care.

2343
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,840
I remember an old-ass PC game.

2344
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,920
I think it was called Global Thermonuclear War.

2345
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Yeah!

2346
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:58,920
Did you ever play that game?

2347
01:47:58,920 --> 01:47:59,920
A long time ago.

2348
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,080
And it was all about nuking other countries.

2349
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:05,040
And they had very- Would you like to play a game?

2350
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,480
Very caricatured world leaders in this.

2351
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,480
And it was just about nuking other countries.

2352
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:14,600
Was it a game that came from War Games?

2353
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,080
The movie War Games?

2354
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,080
It might have.

2355
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,880
The thing was, let's play Global Thermonuclear War.

2356
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:23,480
Yeah, maybe it was that, but it came out much later than the movie was out.

2357
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:25,420
I remember it was on VGA and all that.

2358
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:30,540
They have this game available for download in the DOS museum at LinkedIn chat.

2359
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,540
Very nice.

2360
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:33,960
So, you can check that out, dosmuseum.com.

2361
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,840
Just look for lammers.

2362
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:39,000
And yes, you just gun down people.

2363
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,360
That's all you do.

2364
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:45,840
Somewhere right now in the world, a phone call is being made from an angry parental

2365
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,840
association.

2366
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:50,480
Some folks in chat remember the game, too.

2367
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,480
Reddertainment says they're in chat.

2368
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:53,480
Chat.orangetonsradio.com.

2369
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:54,480
I remember playing this game.

2370
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,320
See, that's what- When I saw the YouTube, then I was like, oh yeah, I have played this

2371
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:58,320
before.

2372
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,320
Anyhow, more news.

2373
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:00,320
Sorry, Logie.

2374
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:06,520
So, there's a possibility, according to Volition, that they may port Saints Row or Red Faction

2375
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,280
to the Wii.

2376
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:10,160
And that's pretty awesome.

2377
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:15,480
I guess during the Red Faction Gorilla launch event in New York, someone apparently asked

2378
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:17,560
them about that.

2379
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:24,840
And they said, though THQ may do Wii versions of our games, in the future Volition won't

2380
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:25,840
be doing them.

2381
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,800
At least not for the next year or so.

2382
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:32,720
So they may have another party or another company port them over.

2383
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,720
I don't know.

2384
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:36,440
I think Saints Row on the Wii is pretty awesome.

2385
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:37,440
Why is that?

2386
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:40,800
Even though graphically it would probably have to be scaled down, but what is it?

2387
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,040
With the motion control and everything?

2388
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:43,040
Or what is it about?

2389
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,040
Yeah, it'd just be murdering things.

2390
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,840
I mean, they actually- Yeah, but wasn't that what Manhunt 2 was supposed to be, and look

2391
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:48,840
how that turned out.

2392
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:52,720
Yeah, but there's other games that are like that that are fun, like Scarface.

2393
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,960
Scarface was pretty fun, and it was kind of the same type of game.

2394
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:59,560
Just Saints Row is really over the top.

2395
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:04,240
But yeah, I would see a Saints Row 3.

2396
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:06,360
Saints Row is kind of one of those overlooked type of games.

2397
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,360
How did the second one sell?

2398
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,360
Do you know?

2399
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,360
Not very well.

2400
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:10,360
Ugh.

2401
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,360
Yeah, it's too bad.

2402
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,760
I'm actually planning on picking up the other expansion pack.

2403
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,680
I still haven't played the last expansion pack that they had come out.

2404
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:21,640
I've been too busy with other things, but I do want to go back to it, because it's pretty

2405
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,640
fun.

2406
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:25,640
I also have Left 4 Dead I haven't played yet, and Fallout 3.

2407
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,560
All these games that are just sitting waiting.

2408
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:30,360
Oh, and Killzone 2 and Resistance 2.

2409
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:32,280
It's too much.

2410
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:37,440
All right, well, moving on with some more gaming news.

2411
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,800
Another series that seems to be making a comeback, Trauma Team.

2412
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,720
This is coming out from Atlus, is putting this out on the Wii.

2413
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,660
And yes, this does appear to be in the same vein as Trauma Center and all that.

2414
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:51,480
This is now Trauma Team is the game that's going to be coming out on the Wii.

2415
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:56,200
It's going to be gameplay six different medical fields, so you're not just necessarily a doctor

2416
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,200
now.

2417
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:01,960
You're going to be a general surgeon, diagnostician, orthopedic surgeon, endoscope technician.

2418
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:03,180
Oh, great.

2419
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:05,960
You can do colonoscopies in a video game now.

2420
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:07,360
Now I've heard everything.

2421
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,720
Medical examiner and EMT.

2422
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:10,720
Very interesting.

2423
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:13,560
Dude that mops up hospital rooms.

2424
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:17,320
I just, I am shocked, because you know what an endoscopy is.

2425
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:18,320
Yes, I do know it.

2426
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,200
That's where they put a tube in your body somewhere.

2427
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:24,640
So like, either you're going to be doing examinations down the mouth and throat, which I guess is

2428
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:28,520
probably likely, or up a butt.

2429
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:32,260
This could be very interesting gaming.

2430
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:37,000
Is Trauma Team about me when I play it, and not the victims in the game?

2431
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,400
It'd be even better if you could do it.

2432
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,840
Will it be Katie Couric showing it live on TV?

2433
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:45,800
Do you have multiple, now do they have two player in the last game?

2434
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,160
I think they did, yes.

2435
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:51,040
Because they should have two player in this, except you would never want to play with me,

2436
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:56,160
because I'd be like, let's play tic-tac-toe on his colon, you know?

2437
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,960
But it looks like, look at this, you're like pounding on a guy's chest in this screenshot

2438
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:01,120
here, like you're doing all these-

2439
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:03,120
God damn it, live!

2440
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,120
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor.

2441
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:11,040
That would be awesome if they had like some sort of vocal recognition software or something

2442
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,040
in there.

2443
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:15,400
It's like karaoke revolution, so you gotta yell like, you know, a phrase or something.

2444
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:19,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, look at this picture here, I gotta link this in chat, look at this.

2445
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,800
Some person lifting up their shirt, exposing their bra while the doctor's operating on

2446
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,800
them.

2447
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,520
This is like little kids playing doctor, realized it's a video game.

2448
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:29,920
It's not a mastectomy.

2449
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,920
Wow.

2450
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:35,480
Wow, we're looking at Grey's Anatomy the game now.

2451
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,480
Apparently.

2452
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:37,480
My gosh.

2453
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:39,360
Grey's Anatomy the game sucks.

2454
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:45,480
Tiger Claw in chat says, the tagline for the game would be, explore Uranus.

2455
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:52,160
Okay, that was probably one of the single most beautiful things I've ever heard from

2456
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:54,200
a listener, ever.

2457
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:59,120
Boldly go, where no man has gone before.

2458
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:03,840
You know what, at E3, I'm gonna make it a point to find this game, and when they tell

2459
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,760
me that you can be an endoscopy technician, I'm gonna say it's so like you can do a colonoscopy

2460
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:08,760
in the game.

2461
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:09,760
Do it.

2462
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:10,760
Oh my god, do it.

2463
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,760
I will do it.

2464
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:12,760
I promise you.

2465
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:13,760
You have to do it.

2466
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,760
I promise the listeners.

2467
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:19,640
I will ask if we get colonoscopies, and when they tell me no, I'm gonna ask why not.

2468
01:53:19,640 --> 01:53:23,280
Do we have an option of leaving a sponge behind?

2469
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:25,760
Ah, crap.

2470
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:32,400
Like you should have to count the sponges and stuff, make sure that they're all there,

2471
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,160
and then you don't, and then later on, you know, it flashes to a cut scene where the

2472
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:40,320
guy's like feeling, you know, like chest pains and stuff like that.

2473
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,720
I can see the scenario now, alright.

2474
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:43,720
Scenario one.

2475
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,720
Okay, here it is.

2476
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:49,840
You've got the diagnostician is playing with the endoscopy, like your team here, so okay,

2477
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,980
this patient has come in and is complaining of pains, and he's feeling some little tapping

2478
01:53:54,980 --> 01:54:05,280
pains in his rear end, and him and his partner were playing with gerbils a little while ago.

2479
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,200
You gotta diagnose and treat.

2480
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:11,200
So I've got gerbils up his butt.

2481
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,200
Let's operate.

2482
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,500
Do we get to hear the Lemmy Winks song at that time?

2483
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,040
This could be the most beautiful video game of all time.

2484
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,680
This has so much potential.

2485
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,100
So much potential.

2486
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:26,880
And then when they die on the operating table, then we have the spinoff, you know, the Phoenix

2487
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:30,200
Rite or the Ace Attorney series, you know.

2488
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,200
The legend is not good.

2489
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,200
Medical malpractice.

2490
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:35,400
Ace Attorney.

2491
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,520
The legend is not good.

2492
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,900
We are so mature tonight.

2493
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:42,240
The legend is not good in chat says, I seriously want to leave a junior mint on the patient

2494
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:44,200
before I stitch him up.

2495
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,200
What?

2496
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,720
So your fart starts smelling minty?

2497
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,200
No, didn't you see that?

2498
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:49,200
No, what?

2499
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:50,200
No.

2500
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,200
It's from Seinfeld.

2501
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:52,200
It's they, they had a junior mint.

2502
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:57,960
They're watching a operation and they drop a junior mint and it gets, it gets into his

2503
01:54:57,960 --> 01:54:58,960
body.

2504
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,920
It makes him really sick, I guess.

2505
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,920
What would happen if you, if you really left a junior mint in someone's body?

2506
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:06,920
It would suck.

2507
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,440
You would not be happy.

2508
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:09,440
That's all.

2509
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,440
You would not be happy.

2510
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,240
All right.

2511
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:19,280
This is getting way too, uh, Frisbee is mentioning the sequel Morg Center.

2512
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:25,560
Death is upon us, dude, God, I love our chatters.

2513
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:27,240
The most fantastic name ever.

2514
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:28,880
I love our chatters so much.

2515
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:29,880
All right.

2516
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,320
Look, uh, we love the listeners so much.

2517
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,960
Let's do a segment dedicated to them.

2518
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,640
It's, yes, it's why they hate.

2519
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:41,320
You've just lavished praise upon our listeners for their genius comments tonight, dark Sakura.

2520
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:44,840
And now I, you know what segment I'm getting to and you're complaining, I'm sorry to take

2521
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:49,760
you away from house building, but it is that time where we open up the mailbag and read

2522
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:55,320
your emails at mailbag at orange launch reader.com and see what you guys have to say.

2523
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:57,840
By the way, Marissa Congusto, you could die.

2524
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,360
You would get a terrible infection.

2525
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:04,080
That's what would happen with the junior men to see, you know, see chat room can answer

2526
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,440
the questions that we can sometimes.

2527
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,440
All right.

2528
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:09,280
Dark Sakura, open up the old email bag at mailbag at orange launch reader.com.

2529
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:13,680
You're gonna have to put your house building away and uh, all right.

2530
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:15,720
And uh, look at this, Rob.

2531
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:16,720
Look at this.

2532
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:17,720
Oh, she's ready to go.

2533
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,720
All right.

2534
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:19,720
Okay.

2535
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:20,720
Email number one.

2536
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:21,720
Dear OLR.

2537
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:27,840
Dear Rob, I think you should stop giving Jamie a hard time and go eat a junior man.

2538
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:33,160
Love, uh, member dark Sakura.

2539
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:34,160
One.

2540
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,160
Okay.

2541
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:38,560
First one is cheeseburger.

2542
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:44,440
Hey guys, last week I was listening live on my PSP, so cool and was not in the chat room.

2543
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:48,120
The thing I wanted to chime in was the discussion of arcade cabinets.

2544
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:51,040
I don't remember who said they would kill for an original star Wars arcade machine,

2545
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,320
but I would so kill for an original star Wars arcade machine.

2546
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:59,520
I'm 15, so obviously didn't grow up in the eighties, but I have always thought, and everyone

2547
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,320
tells me that I was born in the wrong decade.

2548
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:04,800
I would give anything to have grown up in the eighties.

2549
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,800
No Reagan.

2550
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:06,800
That's all.

2551
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,920
Um, I roam eBay for countless hours for classic video games.

2552
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:16,700
I watch all of the AVGN videos and well, the angry video game nerd to translate.

2553
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:20,240
And while this email is getting too long, my longest OLR email so far, I'm going to

2554
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,240
shut up.

2555
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,240
PS sky.

2556
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:26,560
I mess around with iPod custom firmware and would like to make an OLR custom firmware

2557
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,560
for iPod.

2558
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:32,640
So could you send me or link me to some OLR picks to work with?

2559
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:35,100
I will totally forget that request.

2560
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:39,360
So send me a message to my personal email at rob at orange and Andre.com and I will

2561
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:40,920
be happy to do that.

2562
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:41,920
Okay.

2563
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:47,880
Also, I do want to commend our different cheeseburger for vastly improving and spelling and grammar.

2564
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:54,560
So the most improved award you, you win a shiny, shiny gold star you seriously.

2565
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,560
You win.

2566
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:57,840
It's probably one of the most legible emails I've received from cheeseburger.

2567
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:58,840
Here you go.

2568
01:57:58,840 --> 01:57:59,960
Have a junior mint.

2569
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:03,600
You get a golden junior mint, which you don't want to know why it's cold.

2570
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,080
Next email.

2571
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,080
This is from alpha.

2572
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,840
Can anagram it's your OLR.

2573
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:09,840
This is a quick lesson.

2574
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:10,840
The email.

2575
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:11,840
Well, it's a lot longer than I thought it would be.

2576
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:16,520
Actually a plan on getting a PSP go, but I'm keeping my PSP 2000, which has the earliest

2577
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:19,560
motherboard and firmware version 3.90.

2578
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:24,640
The one I had to fix and asked y'all's advice, god I miss people saying that, advice on removing

2579
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:29,240
that damned stripped screw, which I finally got out.

2580
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:34,040
I preordered a game that comes out in a month that is on UMD, I'm importing slash paying

2581
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:39,040
for this one since it comes with a physical preorder bonus that you can't pirate.

2582
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:42,820
But I have just realized that I haven't bought any recent PSP games that require a firmware

2583
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:47,840
update, since my PSP's d-pad was previously broken for the longest time until recently.

2584
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:51,460
And this game probably will have a firmware update on it that will want to be installed

2585
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:52,760
before the game can be played.

2586
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:58,840
The thing is, with multiple commas, is that I still want to hack this PSP and play the

2587
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:03,080
game without updating, but I have no Pandora battery or magic memory stick.

2588
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:08,360
Do y'all know anyone or any place that is reputable and cheap or free to get either

2589
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:09,360
of these items from?

2590
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:14,360
I probably can make the memory stick thing, not sure about the battery part.

2591
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:20,600
You can make the battery, but you need to have another PSP to do that.

2592
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,600
Another PSP.

2593
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,600
So borrow a friend's?

2594
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:25,280
Another PSP with a custom firmware, and then there's a program that you can run to make

2595
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:26,480
the battery.

2596
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:30,120
And then to make a battery for a 2000 is a pain in the ass.

2597
01:59:30,120 --> 01:59:32,600
Because you have to do some extra steps.

2598
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:35,280
But it's not that hard, I did it, I still have one.

2599
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:39,280
Oh, I still have one.

2600
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:44,040
Also, if we're ready then for the conclusion of the email that's answered the question.

2601
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:47,080
This email has been brought to you by Yoshi's Island, home of the never-ending Crying Baby

2602
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:48,080
Marios.

2603
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,080
Waaa!

2604
01:59:49,080 --> 01:59:50,800
God, I hated Toys R Us when that thing was there.

2605
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,800
Oh man.

2606
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,800
I used to play that demo.

2607
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:54,000
Did you use to work at Toys R Us?

2608
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:59,040
No, I just used to frequent Toys R Us when they had toys in there, now that it's Baby

2609
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:02,160
RS slash Toys R Us.

2610
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:05,680
I have to say though, touch fuzzy, get dizzy, one of the greatest stages in all of video

2611
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:06,680
gaming.

2612
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:11,440
Yes, I didn't notice the USB port or spot-to-access battery on the PSP Go pictures, comma comma

2613
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,440
comma.

2614
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:13,440
Hmm.

2615
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:16,720
Well, then again, E3 hasn't happened yet, so I suppose it is a secret to everybody.

2616
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:21,400
PPS, I am probably going to grammar hell, ain't I?

2617
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:25,400
P-P-P-S, To Dark Sakura, comma comma comma heart.

2618
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,840
I know you did that on purpose.

2619
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:29,840
K.

2620
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:30,840
Whatever.

2621
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:31,840
Next email.

2622
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:33,640
Dun dun dun.

2623
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,920
I think this is from Act Deaf.

2624
02:00:34,920 --> 02:00:35,920
Yeah, it is.

2625
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,400
Hi, OLR crew, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Act Deaf.

2626
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:43,520
I'm writing today to ask a couple of questions and to fill some space up in the old mailbag.

2627
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,920
I hope you can answer them.

2628
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:49,400
I'm probably getting a PSP soon, and yeah, I know the PSP Go is coming and all that stuff,

2629
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,000
but I personally think the design sucks.

2630
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Amen!

2631
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,200
Oh my god, it looks like a cell phone.

2632
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:58,640
Of course, one of my immediate purchases is Rock Band Unplugged, and I already have pretty

2633
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:01,600
Can I Be the Hero and Pump It Up Portable.

2634
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:06,040
My question is what other games should I look out for, especially cheap ones since my budget

2635
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:07,600
isn't that big right now.

2636
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:10,960
Any type of game except SRPGs are good.

2637
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:13,720
Potapon 2 and Loco Roko, two, both 20 bucks.

2638
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:14,720
Loco Roko.

2639
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:17,980
Luminous is one of the greatest puzzle games you'll ever play, and the PSP is the platform

2640
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:20,760
to play it on, especially if you can find Luminous 2.

2641
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:25,320
The sequel was really effing good and unfortunately didn't quite have that same magic and momentum

2642
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:29,640
of its first game, although the first game does have Shining and some really good tracks.

2643
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:33,080
Luminous 2, don't overlook it, it's a great little puzzler game.

2644
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:35,200
If you can find it on the cheap, definitely pick that up.

2645
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:38,640
And the Grand Theft Auto games are pretty good too.

2646
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:44,080
Also since you're going to be at E3, I would like to ask you to look for any info on a

2647
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:46,920
possible American release of Space Invaders Extreme 2.

2648
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:50,880
I love the first game and have the Xbox Live Arcade version, I would love to have a localized

2649
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,560
version of it instead of importing it.

2650
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:57,680
I also want to follow up on a call of mine from a few weeks back in the Latin America

2651
02:01:57,680 --> 02:02:01,360
release of Patapon 2, since it's download only in the States.

2652
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:05,160
I searched in some stores here in Mexico a few days ago and found they were selling Patapon

2653
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:10,240
2, and surprisingly it was on UMD, no download copies here apparently.

2654
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:14,320
Thank god Sony did the right thing here and released it on physical media, it would have

2655
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:18,800
been a pain in the ass just to download the thing from the PSN store, though of course

2656
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,040
the game costs double the price in the US.

2657
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:25,680
Well those are my questions for now, I wish you a good trip to E3 Skyloki and I hope you

2658
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:30,200
have a great time there, PS bring us some E3 swag.

2659
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,760
We just might.

2660
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:39,080
Um, okay, I guess this is Dan Shadow, what's your favorite kind of flour, mine's chocolate.

2661
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,080
What?!

2662
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,080
Whatever.

2663
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:43,200
Uh, I like tuna.

2664
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,760
Mine's tuna.

2665
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:47,960
Type of, wait what, flour?

2666
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:48,960
Flour?

2667
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,960
Flour?

2668
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:51,120
The game on Playstation 3.

2669
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,120
I don't know.

2670
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:54,120
Baking.

2671
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:56,720
That's F-L-O-W-E-R.

2672
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:58,600
You didn't say that.

2673
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,340
I said flower, not flower.

2674
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:02,760
You know what, go stuff a junior mint.

2675
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,600
Where the sun don't shine.

2676
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,600
How about the last email?

2677
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,600
A virgin's.

2678
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:07,600
Hello?

2679
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:13,600
I see what you did there, okay.

2680
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:17,240
You made a dumb email pretty good, Loki, good job.

2681
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:18,240
Okay.

2682
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:22,080
Hello NOLA Orange Lounge Radio Crew, this is Blue Swim from the NOLA Army's Twitter

2683
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,080
Division.

2684
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:28,360
Over the Memorial Day weekend last week, my beloved cat of 13 years, Goldie, took ill.

2685
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:31,920
After her condition worsened, I had to do the toughest thing I've ever done and had

2686
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:32,920
her put to sleep.

2687
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:33,920
Aww.

2688
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:35,920
Her passing was the first time I've cried since I was a kid.

2689
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,280
What a downer.

2690
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:38,720
Why did you have to end with this one?

2691
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:39,720
This is sad.

2692
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:41,060
I'm so sorry to hear about that.

2693
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:42,400
It's never easy to lose a pet.

2694
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,400
It's like losing a baby.

2695
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,000
My kitty died.

2696
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,600
It's sad, now I'm going to be in a bad mood the rest of the night.

2697
02:03:47,600 --> 02:03:48,960
Oh, let me finish reading the email.

2698
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:49,960
Fine.

2699
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:50,960
Stop being a baby.

2700
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,280
It wasn't uncommon for her to walk over and plop herself down on my lap while I was in

2701
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:55,920
the middle of playing a game.

2702
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,600
She'd do it even while I was playing the drums and rock band.

2703
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:01,640
It's actually one of my favorite gaming memories, which leads to my question for this email.

2704
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:02,640
This is so sad.

2705
02:04:02,640 --> 02:04:08,100
Do you guys have any gaming related memories involving a pet or pets that you've had?

2706
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:12,400
Thank you for doing OLR all this time, keep doing what you're doing, Blue Swim.

2707
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:16,760
My old cat, Madeline, really the only cat I had because I haven't had one in many years.

2708
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:18,480
She passed away several years ago.

2709
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:21,000
She was actually named after the actress, Madeline Kahn.

2710
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
That's fantastic.

2711
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Yeah, who else?

2712
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,600
Well, because Clue was my favorite movie growing up, so when we got my cat, I named my cat

2713
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:31,120
after Madeline Kahn because, of course, Mrs. White was one of the best characters in that

2714
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:32,120
movie.

2715
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:35,480
Anyhow, my cat would actually, while I was playing video games, my cat liked to hang

2716
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:36,480
out.

2717
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:39,340
Shermie's not on her box, I can tell you that.

2718
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:42,800
My cat liked to hang out in this patio room that we had.

2719
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:46,660
We had an indoor patio and that was basically the cat's room.

2720
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:49,800
My mom didn't like the cat in the house because it would get fur everywhere, but the cat basically

2721
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:50,800
had her own room.

2722
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:53,680
But we had a glass door leading to this indoor patio.

2723
02:04:53,680 --> 02:04:56,900
So when I would play video games, I remember my cat would run up and just kind of stare

2724
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:58,840
through the door at the TV.

2725
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:02,640
But we all know cats don't really see the same images we do.

2726
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,640
Something about the TV.

2727
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:04,640
I don't know.

2728
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:07,520
But when I was a young kid, I used to think, oh, she loves watching me play video games.

2729
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,240
So I remember that with my cat.

2730
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:15,640
Do you have a pet-related story, Logie?

2731
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:20,560
My cat Chase is the Wii pointer on the screen.

2732
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:24,880
When Animal Crossing would come, when we'd play Animal Crossing, and the little bus logo

2733
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:28,600
thing would pop up on the screen, she'd get down the bottom of the TV and start pawing

2734
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,560
at it.

2735
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:37,280
When I got DDR Second Mix, this was actually not too long after I first got Shermie, so

2736
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:40,280
she was probably about two years old at the time.

2737
02:05:40,280 --> 02:05:47,040
She used to hit the analog button on the Dreamcast pads and start the game for me or put me in

2738
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,040
another.

2739
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,040
You know, put me in SSR.

2740
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:52,480
I'd be like, damn it, I'm not that good yet.

2741
02:05:52,480 --> 02:06:00,920
And then she would actually every so often she'd enjoy watching the fish on the Sega

2742
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,320
bass fishing.

2743
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:08,080
And then but now she just sits down and watches us play because she's really fat and lazy.

2744
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:12,920
Marissa in chat says, that has inspired me to name a cat if I ever get one, Gilda.

2745
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:14,440
What an amazing name for a cat.

2746
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:15,440
What an amazing woman.

2747
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:16,440
Gilda, by the way.

2748
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:17,440
My sims have a cat named Sylvia.

2749
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:18,440
Sorry.

2750
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:20,680
I'm going to get all weepy if we keep talking about these, like, cats.

2751
02:06:20,680 --> 02:06:22,880
Let me see if I've got another email.

2752
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,800
Don't we have a dick and fart joke?

2753
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,880
Can't we tell more junior men jokes?

2754
02:06:25,880 --> 02:06:26,880
Something?

2755
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,880
Oh, shoot.

2756
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:28,880
I forgot to read the very last part of that email.

2757
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:29,880
Oh, okay.

2758
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:33,000
In case you were curious, the title of this email, and lost a friend, is a reference to

2759
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,900
the Exploder Evacuator Part 2 radio commercial from GTA Vice City.

2760
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:38,840
Now you know annoying is half the battle.

2761
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:40,240
Peace, Smiley.

2762
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:44,200
Well, best of luck with and I'm really sorry to hear about your loss.

2763
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:47,960
And if your family decides to get another cat, there are many, many cats out there who

2764
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:48,960
need love.

2765
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:49,960
Adopt a cat.

2766
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:52,640
Everyone go out there and adopt a cat.

2767
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:54,280
Well, some people are allergic.

2768
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:55,280
Some people don't.

2769
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,280
So I'm allergic.

2770
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:59,800
I have air filters in my house and I take sinus medicine every day.

2771
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:01,400
I love my cat.

2772
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:04,220
I will do whatever I can to keep my cat.

2773
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:09,160
So if I can't, the only thing I won't get a dog because I'm actually so allergic to

2774
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:11,000
dogs that allergy medicine does not touch it.

2775
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,880
I actually, I don't know if I've ever gotten into this on the show and maybe I shouldn't,

2776
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:15,640
but I actually have a fear of dogs.

2777
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:16,640
It's taken me a little.

2778
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:17,640
Do you?

2779
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:19,800
Yes, I have a, I have a definite case of fear of dogs.

2780
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:20,800
It doesn't matter the size.

2781
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,440
I get really nervous around dogs.

2782
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:26,860
I've gotten a lot better with it in the past five years than I would say from the time

2783
02:07:26,860 --> 02:07:29,720
I was five through about the time I was like 21.

2784
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:30,720
It was really bad.

2785
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:35,920
Like whenever I get around dogs, I get really nervous, like I can't like be around dogs.

2786
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:41,160
And this goes back to, I was bit by one when I was five and it was very, um, traumatic.

2787
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:43,160
So be careful with that book.

2788
02:07:43,160 --> 02:07:45,160
It's older than me.

2789
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,160
Oh yeah.

2790
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:47,160
Okay.

2791
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:48,160
Um, you know what though?

2792
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:49,160
You should meet pocket.

2793
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,720
I think actually you'd scream like a little girl about pocket.

2794
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:51,720
See, here's the thing.

2795
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:55,000
And I don't want to disappoint you, but everybody tells me I would feel different about their

2796
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:59,780
dog and I won't like, I'm just, no, I think you'd scream like a little girl around pocket.

2797
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:00,780
What is this big?

2798
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:05,600
Oh, then, Oh, well that would scream in terror and you would, you want to put me in my own

2799
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:06,600
personal hell.

2800
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,600
Sure.

2801
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:08,600
I'll do that.

2802
02:08:08,600 --> 02:08:11,720
And has the loudest bark ever.

2803
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:13,360
That's not even, I don't have a dog.

2804
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:16,080
I won't have a dog and I don't let them in my house.

2805
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:18,040
Um, so you don't have to worry about it for me.

2806
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:24,480
The only kind of dog I want is a, is a, uh, corgi, uh, I N G N zero and I'm sorry, I'm

2807
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:25,480
sorry.

2808
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:26,480
I'm not pronouncing your name right.

2809
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,480
Probably says a Rob.

2810
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,040
You fear guns, projectiles and dogs.

2811
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:30,040
Yeah.

2812
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:31,040
That about covers it.

2813
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:34,560
You know, I wonder if you would be okay with the Basenji.

2814
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,480
They're not really like a modern dog.

2815
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:37,480
I will say this.

2816
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:41,800
There has been one dog that I was able to get along with and it was my, um, grandma's

2817
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:44,160
old dash on wiener dog.

2818
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:47,920
Um, because yeah, it was missing an eye.

2819
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:55,040
So it was a handicapped dog and very, very quiet, very slow moving, very, you know, like

2820
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,760
very just, I needed, I need an old lazy dog.

2821
02:08:58,760 --> 02:08:59,760
If anything.

2822
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:00,760
Well, I don't need a dog.

2823
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:01,760
I will always be a cat person.

2824
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:04,720
If you were to have a dog, which won't happen, if you worked, if someone told us to bring

2825
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:09,000
a dog in your house, in an alternate universe, it would have to be an old lazy fat dog.

2826
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Yes.

2827
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Something like that.

2828
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Blind in one eye.

2829
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Yes.

2830
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Answer's still lucky.

2831
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,360
So no offense to you dog owners out there, but just understand this, this goes back to

2832
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,640
a childhood fear that I can't shake.

2833
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:20,420
You have a fish called kitty.

2834
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:21,420
A fish called puppy.

2835
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:22,420
That's my roommates.

2836
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:23,420
Not mine.

2837
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:24,420
Oh, you should get a cat.

2838
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:26,000
Uh, roommate doesn't want one.

2839
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And I, I understand.

2840
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:31,280
Um, maybe, maybe later on, maybe later on, but I definitely am getting a cat at some

2841
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:32,280
point.

2842
02:09:32,280 --> 02:09:36,240
But you know, when, when, uh, when there's somebody else to take care of, if you get

2843
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:40,600
a boy cat name and Frank, I haven't thought of, I haven't even thought of names yet.

2844
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:41,600
I get a boy cat.

2845
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,000
His name is going to be Frank.

2846
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,440
After Frank inverter, cheeseburger in our chat room says, Rob hell is a great Dane with

2847
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:53,040
Mayo and guns pretty much pretty much that about sums it up.

2848
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,040
All right.

2849
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,040
Look, some more news.

2850
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,040
Cause we want to take your calls.

2851
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:57,040
All night long.

2852
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,040
Geez, Louise.

2853
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:59,040
Yeah.

2854
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,040
You people gotta get out of my house.

2855
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,040
All right.

2856
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,040
Loki, please.

2857
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:07,260
Um, well, I don't know if anyone remembers, uh, the old toy mad balls, but apparently

2858
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:13,740
mad balls are coming back, um, with an Xbox live arcade game, uh, called mad balls in

2859
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:16,360
Babbo invasion.

2860
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:22,360
And it's going to be a, um, action game where you can, uh, basically like a shoot them up

2861
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:29,000
action game and it's going to have, um, four player co-op, 16 player multiplayer and randomly

2862
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,840
generated maps.

2863
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:34,620
And I have their PR guy keeps hounding me.

2864
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:37,260
So we have actually a meeting with them at E3.

2865
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:43,800
It's my first meeting, so, uh, we'll find out more about it, but you know, when I first

2866
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:46,280
saw this, I'm like mad balls, really?

2867
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,880
Is that like a smart IP to try to bring back?

2868
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:54,920
I mean, really, but reading the comments on like some of these news stories, everybody's

2869
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:57,240
like really enthusiastic about it.

2870
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:58,240
I'm like, okay.

2871
02:10:58,240 --> 02:10:59,240
Might be.

2872
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:02,720
You know who won't be playing that?

2873
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:03,920
Me.

2874
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:07,400
I will wait for Loki's report before I make a decision either way.

2875
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:10,160
Oh, I was going to drag you along.

2876
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,160
Oh, goodie.

2877
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:12,160
When is this?

2878
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:13,160
Wednesday?

2879
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,160
Noon.

2880
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:15,160
Yeah.

2881
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:16,160
Oh, fine.

2882
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:17,160
I'll go.

2883
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:18,160
We'll see.

2884
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:22,280
I don't have a lot of meetings planned, but I, you know, I find, especially with the smaller

2885
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:25,080
companies, if you walk up and care, they will talk your ear off.

2886
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:26,480
So I'm, I'm all for it.

2887
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:27,480
Why not?

2888
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:30,560
Well, I don't want to spend an hour looking at this one game.

2889
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:32,840
Well, yeah, I mean, well, it depends.

2890
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:33,840
It depends.

2891
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,400
I'm going to open mind, open mind.

2892
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,960
They gave me a 15 inch spiel and that's it.

2893
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:41,000
Well, they don't have a booth, so they don't really have anything to demonstrate.

2894
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,640
I mean, we'll see.

2895
02:11:43,640 --> 02:11:44,640
We'll see.

2896
02:11:44,640 --> 02:11:45,640
All right.

2897
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:46,640
More to come.

2898
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:47,640
Of course.

2899
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:49,480
We're not doing a show next week, are we?

2900
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:50,480
Because of E3.

2901
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,480
I'll be back.

2902
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:52,960
Are you going to be back?

2903
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,280
I'll be back, but we'll see.

2904
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:56,600
We may or may not be here next week.

2905
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:58,080
I know it's Bobby's 200th show.

2906
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:01,640
He may want to go along or he might be tired too.

2907
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:05,080
More to come on that if we will be here next week or not, but we'll definitely do something

2908
02:12:05,080 --> 02:12:06,080
to cover E3.

2909
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:09,640
Anyhow, I want to move on though with some of the news that came out this weekend.

2910
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:11,640
The next story has to do with Grand Theft Auto.

2911
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:15,880
This was some news that kind of got trumped a little bit by everything else, all the leaks

2912
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:16,880
coming out of E3.

2913
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:17,880
This is certainly huge news.

2914
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:20,040
That also proves that that last, what was it?

2915
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:21,040
That Twitter.

2916
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:25,720
Remember that Twitter reveal that it was supposed to have the full E3 lineup for Microsoft.

2917
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:27,720
Yeah, it was a bunch of bullshit.

2918
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:28,720
Oh, why?

2919
02:12:28,720 --> 02:12:29,720
Because they had the wrong title.

2920
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:30,720
Oh, they had the wrong title.

2921
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:33,000
Well, who would have thought that this would be the title?

2922
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,280
I mean, I don't think anyone could have guessed that the official title of the next expansion

2923
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:39,140
is The Ballad of Gay Tony.

2924
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:43,360
And apparently in this, you will be taking on Luis Lopez, who is a part-time hoodlum

2925
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:48,160
and full-time assistant to nightclub impresario Tony Prince, who is Gay Tony.

2926
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:50,160
Now, I don't know enough about the story.

2927
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:51,840
Loki, please explain.

2928
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,560
Who is Gay Tony and is he just happy or is he gay?

2929
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:55,560
No, he's gay.

2930
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:57,400
He's a nightclub owner.

2931
02:12:57,400 --> 02:13:03,120
Basically, really all the expansions tie in with is there's a mission that's called the

2932
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:04,880
Impossible Trinity.

2933
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:10,980
And basically, it's a diamond deal that goes down bad.

2934
02:13:10,980 --> 02:13:22,280
Both Nico and Johnny are there doing an exchange with the Triads for selling them diamonds.

2935
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:28,140
And Luis comes in and basically robs them of their diamonds and breaks up the whole

2936
02:13:28,140 --> 02:13:32,640
thing and there's a big gun battle in the Museum of Natural History.

2937
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:34,360
So that all goes down.

2938
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:36,080
I'm not really sure what they're going to cover with this.

2939
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:39,760
There's a lot of speculation saying because the last expansion, they updated the rock

2940
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,280
and rap stations and stuff.

2941
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:45,840
This is going to be more of the electronica updates as far as music goes and stuff.

2942
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:50,780
And it's supposed to focus around Al Gonquin, his nightclub and stuff like that.

2943
02:13:50,780 --> 02:13:53,080
Maybe like the safe house and stuff.

2944
02:13:53,080 --> 02:13:56,640
Now, before you might think my feathers are ruffled being the gay guy on the show that

2945
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:00,080
they're naming this, the ballad of Gay Tony or whatever, I actually kind of don't care

2946
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:03,040
because Rockstar has a track record of handling these issues pretty good.

2947
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:07,960
I mean, we remember Bully, you know, actually kind of handled it fairly interesting.

2948
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:11,480
And you know, I don't see any, you know, if it's a gay character in a story, who cares?

2949
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:16,920
I think you run into Gay Tony in the first game, well, like the main storyline.

2950
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:20,200
So you know, it's all about and how they handle it.

2951
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:21,200
Yeah.

2952
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:24,100
Now, but let me tell you what pisses, well, is there anything else you want to mention

2953
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:25,160
about this though?

2954
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:28,960
Because I'm going to segue into the FUs of the week here because there is one thing about

2955
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,800
this that kind of pisses me off.

2956
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:35,240
And it's the whole fact that you can call this game the Ballad of Gay Tony, but heaven

2957
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:38,480
forbid you can't put gay in your profile.

2958
02:14:38,480 --> 02:14:41,940
Remember that whole thing that came up a couple of weeks ago where Microsoft says you can't,

2959
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:45,800
you know, talk about the sexuality stuff in your profile, but yet it's okay to name the

2960
02:14:45,800 --> 02:14:48,280
game the Ballad of Gay Tony.

2961
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:50,940
So I see a double standard here.

2962
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:53,420
And when I see double standards, I get very irritated.

2963
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:56,320
Not that I want to put gay in my profile, but if somebody does, why shouldn't they be

2964
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:57,580
allowed to?

2965
02:14:57,580 --> 02:15:02,080
You know, if somebody wants to put, hi, I'm gay or whatever, then that's their prerogative.

2966
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:05,240
If somebody puts, I hate gays, well, that's a lot different.

2967
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:06,240
See what I'm saying?

2968
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,240
Yeah.

2969
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,400
But anyhow, there's a clear double standard here.

2970
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:09,400
Double standards piss me off.

2971
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:15,400
It's time for the FUs of the week.

2972
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:36,920
Um, believe it or not, I don't have, I don't, I'm in a pretty darn good mood right now.

2973
02:15:36,920 --> 02:15:42,160
So actually, God, we're in like bizarro world tonight.

2974
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:46,280
You know what, can you do some dark soccer?

2975
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:47,280
Sorry to hear it.

2976
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,280
Sorry I'm not laughing.

2977
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:53,280
It's just funny out of everything that comes out of it, you got that.

2978
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,280
Sorry to hear it.

2979
02:15:55,280 --> 02:16:02,400
FU to housework and because my knees hurt because I've been crawling around on laminate

2980
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:05,560
flooring and they're all bruised, so that sucks.

2981
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:09,560
And I still have lots of paintings to do and I have a lot of other stuff I have to do when

2982
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:13,160
I'm moving in in two weeks, so yikes.

2983
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:18,160
So FU to work, oh, and I've been getting up at eight in the morning working till like six

2984
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:19,160
at night today.

2985
02:16:19,160 --> 02:16:26,240
I flipped off a day of work after the morning later worked at the house, so yeah, long days.

2986
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:27,920
But how is it being in your own house now?

2987
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:33,120
Um, it'll be cool when it's done and just, uh, we have like the baseboards to do and painting

2988
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:34,120
and stuff.

2989
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:36,120
Luckily my parents are helping out the kitchen and stuff.

2990
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:40,120
My dad's been really cool when it comes down to actually, you know, help me during the

2991
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:44,120
days to stop for me to come in, you know, during the times I'm gone, yeah, I use the

2992
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:47,120
green stuff to come in and do all the baseboards.

2993
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:51,120
Some of my mom's gonna be painting while I'm gone and stuff, so you know, couldn't have

2994
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,120
done it without them, so it's really cool.

2995
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,120
But yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty awesome.

2996
02:16:55,120 --> 02:17:02,120
I, I keep, I'm tempted because my wife promised when we get a house I could get an arcade

2997
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:03,120
cabinet.

2998
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:04,120
Of course she said that all the time.

2999
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:05,120
She just sold ours.

3000
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,120
So, maybe.

3001
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:11,120
But I'm not building it this time.

3002
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:14,120
It'll be pre, pre-cut, prefab.

3003
02:17:14,120 --> 02:17:21,620
All right, um, and I will, uh, go ahead and, uh, say, um, my F.U. of the week goes to spammers.

3004
02:17:21,620 --> 02:17:26,120
Oh my god, I've been getting more spam on Gmail lately, like I don't know what happened,

3005
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:29,420
but over the weekend the spammers figured out how to get through or something, and I've

3006
02:17:29,420 --> 02:17:33,120
been getting spam messages like crazy on Gmail, I don't know if it's just me.

3007
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:34,120
I've been too, I've been too.

3008
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:38,120
I've been getting so pissed off, and it made, like, I fucking hate spammers.

3009
02:17:38,120 --> 02:17:39,620
I fucking hate them.

3010
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:41,120
Like, why do they do this?

3011
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,120
Like, I mean, they slow down the internet with all their traffic.

3012
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:48,120
Do people actually buy the shit in these emails?

3013
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:51,120
Do people actually legitimately believe this stuff?

3014
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,120
Like, and sadly, even if one person out of a million believes it, it's probably worth

3015
02:17:55,120 --> 02:18:00,120
it to these people, but they're just, they're the parasites of pond scum.

3016
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:01,120
They're, I hate it.

3017
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:02,120
I hate it.

3018
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:08,120
They stop when they start charging postage on emails, which they shouldn't do, though.

3019
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:12,120
There's that, there's the, I know, there's a whole, like, double standard thing, but

3020
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:16,120
they shouldn't do that, but I mean, maybe for mass emails or something they need to.

3021
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:20,120
I don't know, but I'm getting so irritated with freaking spam email.

3022
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:22,120
It's sick.

3023
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:24,120
That's a pretty epic F.E., Rob.

3024
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:28,120
Well, we should, seriously, we need to, like, in countries that support spammers, we need

3025
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:30,120
to just drop a nuclear bomb or something.

3026
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:31,120
Get rid of these people.

3027
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:37,120
All right, I'm being a little extreme, but it is just obscene.

3028
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:40,120
Like, we need to do something to stop this.

3029
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:44,120
And it's not just, like, it's not just that I'm annoyed.

3030
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:45,120
I am annoyed.

3031
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:50,120
It's not just that, but the fact that they slow down the internet with their poop that

3032
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:52,120
flies out of their keyboards.

3033
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:56,120
I get more spam in my actual Orange Lounge account than I do.

3034
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,120
Seriously, we get inundated with the Orange Lounge.

3035
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:01,120
God!

3036
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:04,120
I'm so sick of spam.

3037
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:05,120
All right.

3038
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:11,120
But, you know, it's, unfortunately, it's, you know, part of the hazards of being on

3039
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:12,120
the internet.

3040
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:18,120
However, I do not advocate just, you know, sitting back and letting it happen, of course.

3041
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:23,120
All right, Bobby linked me to a website here with, actually, kind of a clarification, I

3042
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:27,120
suppose, on the whole, you called the game Gay Tony, but you can't have gay in your

3043
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:34,120
profile or whatever, and this is a website called step2.com, which is, I think he's

3044
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:41,120
a guy who's involved with the, what is he, the community, I don't think he's community

3045
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,120
director or something, but he does stuff with Microsoft.

3046
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:50,120
Anyway, he basically says that the code of conduct policy does allow you to express vocally

3047
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:52,120
on the service your relationship preference.

3048
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:56,120
People get this wrong in saying all instances the word gay, for instance, are forbidden

3049
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:57,120
from all of Xbox Live.

3050
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:00,120
Therefore, this new download content represents a violation.

3051
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:01,120
This is not the case.

3052
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,120
I appreciate the appearance of a disconnect, but there isn't.

3053
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:08,120
There's other content in Grand Theft Auto 4 that would likewise not be allowed in a

3054
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:09,120
gamertag or profile.

3055
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:13,120
Quotes from movies that you can obtain on Marketplace that are not allowed in gamertags

3056
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,120
or profiles.

3057
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:18,120
Rated, purchasable content has all sorts of technical rules and restrictions as to what

3058
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:20,120
type of accounts can view them.

3059
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:24,120
Limitations, synopsis and plot summary and so forth that gamertags and profiles do not

3060
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:26,120
currently have.

3061
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:28,120
I don't know.

3062
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:29,120
I don't know.

3063
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:30,120
I'm still not 100% convinced.

3064
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:33,120
I'm thankful that they're aware that there's a disconnect here, but I don't know.

3065
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:37,120
I'm not 100% convinced when we do see some of these reports coming out and so forth,

3066
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:40,120
but I do appreciate the clarification if nothing else.

3067
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:44,120
And they say they're working with these organizations, et cetera, et cetera.

3068
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:47,120
They've been working with them for months and months.

3069
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:51,120
Let's see what happens.

3070
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:52,120
All right.

3071
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:53,120
Anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news.

3072
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,120
We're almost to the phone.

3073
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:57,120
Stark Soccer, if you wouldn't mind.

3074
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:03,120
Well, this is, I don't know.

3075
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:17,120
Tecmo Bowl for Wii is actually put on hold and is being converted into Family Fun Football.

3076
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:24,120
They are basically saying that they're switching it to a family-oriented game because of market

3077
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:27,120
research and to go to the Wii's target audience.

3078
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:31,120
Because that's everybody that owns the Wii is the family demographic, and they are not

3079
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,120
going to recognize the name Tecmo Bowl.

3080
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,120
So they're selling out.

3081
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:36,120
Sad, but it makes sense.

3082
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:38,120
Makes complete sense, sadly.

3083
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:43,120
But on Xbox 360, there will be Tecmo Bowl for Xbox Live Arcade, and that will be in

3084
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:45,120
early 2010.

3085
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:46,120
Nice.

3086
02:21:46,120 --> 02:21:48,120
So hunt for that at E3.

3087
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,120
Let us know.

3088
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:51,120
Cool.

3089
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:55,120
There's some pretty cool stuff coming over from Exceed.

3090
02:21:55,120 --> 02:22:02,120
They're a company that localizes a lot of games that normally come out in Japan.

3091
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:04,120
Our modern working designs?

3092
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:06,120
Yes, basically.

3093
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:11,120
In fact, some of the cool stuff that they're bringing to E3 this year, Ju-On the Grudge

3094
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:12,120
for the Wii.

3095
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,120
Sweet!

3096
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:16,120
The Regile, Farewell, Ruins of the Moon.

3097
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:19,120
That's actually supposed to be a pretty kick-ass looking game.

3098
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:23,120
Lunar Silver Star Harmony for the PSP.

3099
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:25,120
Half Minute Hero for the PSP.

3100
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,120
Remember that Yusa 30 game that they had?

3101
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:30,120
That looks pretty sweet.

3102
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:33,120
Ark Rise Fantasia.

3103
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:35,120
Flower, Sun, and Rain.

3104
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:36,120
Little King's Story.

3105
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:38,120
Ragnarok Online DS.

3106
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:39,120
Woohoo!

3107
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:42,120
And Valhalla Knights Elder Saga.

3108
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:47,120
So lots of cool import-friendly stuff coming from them.

3109
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:49,120
Probably a booth I'll have to visit.

3110
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:52,120
Alright, well something else that is going to definitely appeal to some folks out there,

3111
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:57,120
and maybe not to others, but you might remember there was some talk about a Tony Hawk skateboard

3112
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,120
peripheral coming out very soon.

3113
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,120
Well, some more details have leaked on Tony Hawk Ride.

3114
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:04,120
That is the game, and this is from GameStop.

3115
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:06,120
The game is coming out October 13th.

3116
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:09,120
It's going to set you back $120.

3117
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:13,120
Tony Hawk Ride, which comes with a little skateboard controller.

3118
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,120
So, could be interesting.

3119
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:18,120
Could be dangerous, too.

3120
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:22,120
I mean, God, I could just see people breaking their TVs left and right with this thing.

3121
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:24,120
If you're having a little too much fun.

3122
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:28,120
But, I mean, I don't know, how much fun can this really be?

3123
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:31,120
Am I just being a pessimist? How much fun can this really be?

3124
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,120
I mean, isn't part of riding a skateboard having wheels?

3125
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:36,120
I mean, I guess you could make the same argument.

3126
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:39,120
Well, how much fun is Wii Sports because it's not actual tennis?

3127
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,120
Or why do people play Wii Bowling and not actual bowling?

3128
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:47,120
I don't know. There's something about this specifically that I'm looking at going,

3129
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:48,120
how can this really be fun?

3130
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:51,120
This is a little curvy board that sits on your floor. I don't know.

3131
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:53,120
It'd be like, what was the arcade game?

3132
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:58,120
But then again, I was defending Wii Fit earlier, so what the hell right do I have to bash this game?

3133
02:23:58,120 --> 02:23:59,120
I don't know.

3134
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:01,120
Yeah, Rob. No, really.

3135
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:08,120
It'd be like, though, what was that one Sega game that you, you know, got to do all the...

3136
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:09,120
The activator?

3137
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:12,120
No, I'm talking about the arcade.

3138
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:15,120
It would be something along those lines, I think.

3139
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,120
You know...

3140
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:18,120
Oh, oh God, Alpine Racer.

3141
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:22,120
Well, no, they had the skateboard game.

3142
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:24,120
It was similar to that, though. I know what you're talking about.

3143
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:25,120
A skate or something?

3144
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:26,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3145
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:31,120
I guess, but even that, I don't know, had movement or something.

3146
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:35,120
I mean, it wasn't just a board that was lying on the ground, you know what I mean?

3147
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:37,120
Like, you actually spun around.

3148
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,120
I remember that. You used to have the golf lamp back in the day, right?

3149
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:43,120
It would actually kind of spin around and you had the railings to hold on to.

3150
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:45,120
Like, this is not going to be that elaborate, you know?

3151
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:50,120
You still had that feeling of motion in the game because of the whole elaborate setup it had.

3152
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:52,120
That's true. That is true.

3153
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:57,120
So, sj100matt in our chatroom, chat.orangelandraday.com says,

3154
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,120
Seriously? $120? I can put that towards a real skateboard.

3155
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:03,120
Hitstun corrects the name. Top Skater and AirTricks.

3156
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:06,120
Top Skater, that was it. AirTricks is what I was actually thinking of.

3157
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:10,120
And Rob D says there were two arcade skateboarding games, but I don't remember the names.

3158
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:11,120
Well, there they were.

3159
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:14,120
So, there it is.

3160
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:16,120
Top Skater.

3161
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:19,120
Yeah, I think that's one of the ones I'm thinking of.

3162
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:22,120
And I think we had both those games at one point at Golf Land.

3163
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:25,120
But this isn't it. I'll tell you that much.

3164
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:30,120
One more story from all of us, then we're going to get to your calls at 1877-GAME-OLR in just a moment.

3165
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:33,120
But first, a few more stories. DarkSakura.

3166
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:38,120
Well, how about something for LEGO Indiana Jones? This is kind of cool.

3167
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:43,120
Well, for LEGO Indiana Jones 2, I should say, is that you're going to be able to build your own stages.

3168
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:54,120
So, basically, you can do levels, tombs, challenges, sandbox areas, put down plates, traps, all that kind of fun stuff.

3169
02:25:54,120 --> 02:26:00,120
You can actually save everything and go back and do your playthrough again on your homemade level.

3170
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:03,120
It's like Forge, but for LEGO Indiana Jones.

3171
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:09,120
Well, now, you're someone that likes to build your own stuff, DarkSakura, so maybe this is something that you'd be interested in?

3172
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:10,120
Probably not.

3173
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:14,120
If I can't violently kill people in this, I'm not interested.

3174
02:26:14,120 --> 02:26:17,120
Maybe I can recreate the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland.

3175
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:19,120
Now that, I would be down for.

3176
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:21,120
Fire!

3177
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:24,120
Because that's the whole reason to ride that ride, because you get fire.

3178
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:25,120
Yes.

3179
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:32,120
So there's some other stuff that's coming to E3 that's going to be pretty interesting.

3180
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:37,120
You may remember developer High Voltage, they're bringing out the brand new first person shooter game,

3181
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,120
the Conduit to the Wii, pretty soon.

3182
02:26:40,120 --> 02:26:44,120
It's a game that's kind of pushing the edge of what the Wii can do.

3183
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:46,120
They have some new games coming out, though.

3184
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:54,120
The first one being Gladiator AD, an ultra-bloody fighting game that puts you in the role of a roaming gladiator.

3185
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:56,120
Looks pretty sweet.

3186
02:26:56,120 --> 02:27:03,120
And then, to go along with that, something more like a normal traditional shooter, a game called The Grinder,

3187
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:07,120
which is going to be kind of like a supernatural shooter game.

3188
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:11,120
It's got like vampires and stuff like that, and werewolves.

3189
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:14,120
So, looks kind of cool.

3190
02:27:14,120 --> 02:27:19,120
Actually, sadly enough, this game kind of reminds me a little bit of that game from Gamecock,

3191
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:22,120
which I cannot remember for the life of me what it was called.

3192
02:27:22,120 --> 02:27:24,120
Are these games we're going to see at E3?

3193
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:27,120
I don't know, they were just announced.

3194
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:30,120
Maybe? I don't know if we...

3195
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:35,120
Sometimes a game being at E3, though, is just a trailer showing on a monitor, you know what I mean?

3196
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:37,120
A lot of these games are probably like that.

3197
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:40,120
It's possible. Maybe we'll see this. I don't know, though.

3198
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:45,120
Not every game is playable. I think we forget that a lot of shit at E3 is not touchable.

3199
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:48,120
Like everything from Square Enix.

3200
02:27:48,120 --> 02:27:52,120
Usually. I bet that new Kingdom Hearts game will be playable, though.

3201
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:54,120
Yeah, it's already out in Japan.

3202
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:57,120
That, what, 3283 or whatever it's called? Some weird name.

3203
02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:01,120
Again, I don't understand, because I thought this was a series aimed at kind of kids,

3204
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:04,120
and they do all this weird stuff with it, but I don't know.

3205
02:28:04,120 --> 02:28:06,120
I don't understand some of the Kingdom Hearts logic sometimes.

3206
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:08,120
I love the games, though. I do. I really do.

3207
02:28:08,120 --> 02:28:12,120
And I know I'm not going to see Kingdom Hearts 3 at this year's E3, and I'm just going to be pissed.

3208
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:13,120
Oh.

3209
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:15,120
Are we going to go to the theater?

3210
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:18,120
Thank you. Game Guru says 3582 Days is the name of it.

3211
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:22,120
Yeah, I'd love to go to the theater and check it out if they have it again this year, which I assume they will.

3212
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:24,120
Because it's always like a waste of time.

3213
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:26,120
No, I mean, not that I don't like doing it, but it's like...

3214
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:30,120
You know what? I actually like seeing the epic Squeenix trailers on the big screen.

3215
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:34,120
It's like, oh my god, it's a trailer for Final Fantasy XI.

3216
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:37,120
Seeing the trailer... Look, I make this comparison.

3217
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:40,120
What about when you see trailers for movies on the big screen?

3218
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:43,120
Like, when you saw the trailer for The Dark Knight for the first time,

3219
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:47,120
or when you see the trailers for Harry Potter, if you're into that or whatever.

3220
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:51,120
When you see these trailers on the big screen, isn't it so much better than when you're watching them on your tiny ass computer screen?

3221
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:52,120
Yeah, it'll be alright.

3222
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:54,120
Same thing. Same thing.

3223
02:28:54,120 --> 02:28:56,120
It depends. It really depends.

3224
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:57,120
How so?

3225
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:00,120
Well, I mean, because really, sometimes there's been...

3226
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:05,120
I'll just see movies that I really could care less about, honestly.

3227
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:10,120
So, I was like, um, why did I have to see this big? Why does it have to, you know, be involved in my life right now?

3228
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:13,120
So, that's what I mean.

3229
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:16,120
Alright. Well, let's move on to one more gaming story,

3230
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:19,120
and then we're gonna take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

3231
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:21,120
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadial.

3232
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:27,120
Please make sure, if you're gonna use Skype, make sure you've tested your call with echo123 as the username on Skype.

3233
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:29,120
We had some issues last week with some of our callers,

3234
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:32,120
so please make sure that your volume's okay by giving echo123 a call.

3235
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:35,120
We got one more story for you guys, though, before we get to the phones,

3236
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:37,120
and it has to do with the DSi,

3237
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:42,120
and I guess this is one of those, uh, you knew this rumor would show up at some point.

3238
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:45,120
I'm sure it's come up before. Well, guess what? It's coming up again.

3239
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:50,120
Apparently, as you know, the DSi had the Game Boy Advance port removed from the game.

3240
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:55,120
Well, could this possibly be because something a little shadier is in store?

3241
02:29:55,120 --> 02:30:00,120
You're gonna soon be able to download Game Boy Advance titles onto your DSi,

3242
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:03,120
just like you download old-school Nintendo games to your Wii.

3243
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:10,120
Pretty soon, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games on your DSi through the DSiWare store.

3244
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:12,120
And move goes the cow.

3245
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:17,120
I know, and the sheep will herd into this and, uh, buy this crap, I'm sure.

3246
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:19,120
Tons and tons.

3247
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:20,120
No, I don't know, though. There might be-

3248
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:25,120
And at the same time, why can't they just put this stuff on the Wii?

3249
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:27,120
I mean, like these Game Boy Advance titles and stuff.

3250
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:31,120
Hey, or some other functionality, and maybe you can tie your accounts together,

3251
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:36,120
and then if you download a Game Boy Advance title on the Wii, you can take it with you on your DSi.

3252
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:40,120
That would be cool and innovative, which will never happen.

3253
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:45,120
I think some people forgot, as well, we had a Game Boy Advance player on the GameCube.

3254
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:46,120
Yes, I remember that.

3255
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:48,120
So they can put those games on your TV.

3256
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:51,120
Game Boy Color player on the Super NES.

3257
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:56,120
That's right. So they can put it on your TV, so don't listen to that garbage that they can't do it.

3258
02:30:56,120 --> 02:30:57,120
Because they can. They have.

3259
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:00,120
Yeah, I was about to just say that they can and have.

3260
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:05,120
But, I mean, honestly, though, you know what the deal is for them.

3261
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,120
In the end, the only thing that it is is the bottom line.

3262
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:10,120
I know, and there will be-

3263
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:11,120
And they can make money.

3264
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:15,120
It's instant money. It's free money. They're gonna find free money wherever they can.

3265
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:19,120
That's the plan. Anyhow, let's go to the phones. They're ringing off the hook tonight.

3266
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:21,120
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3267
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:22,120
It's GS68.

3268
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:25,120
Hello, GS68. How you doing?

3269
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:28,120
Alright, I'm here to talk about Fanime.

3270
02:31:28,120 --> 02:31:33,120
That's right. I don't think you were there last week while our show was going on, so how was fun?

3271
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:39,120
Yeah, unlike last year, I didn't get to call in at all, or listen at all.

3272
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:44,120
That's alright. We had a short show last week because of the holidays, so we didn't end up doing a whole lot.

3273
02:31:44,120 --> 02:31:46,120
And Loki wasn't here, so...

3274
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:49,120
And I know it hasn't gone on the podcast feed yet, but it will soon.

3275
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:52,120
So, what's on your mind? How was the con? Tell us about it.

3276
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:59,120
It was pretty good. I was mostly in the gaming room this year, and I saw the most badass 2DX setup.

3277
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:06,120
Like, someone had actual arcade hardware hooked up to a PS2 with one of the PS2 versions of 2DX,

3278
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:11,120
so my one complaint was that it was not an HDTV, so it was very laggy.

3279
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:14,120
That's pretty cool. What else was in the game room?

3280
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:21,120
What else? They had a bunch of scrolling shooters, like Radiant Silvergun and Gradius.

3281
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:25,120
One of my friends brought his Tetris of Grandmaster arcade board, so I got to play that.

3282
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:30,120
Did they still have, like, one thing I remember from the last Fanime I went to, which was a couple years ago,

3283
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:36,120
tons and tons and tons of DS gamers, like, you know, all playing the Japanese games and stuff,

3284
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:40,120
and beaming the games to each other, like, there's just tons of that that goes on.

3285
02:32:40,120 --> 02:32:46,120
I didn't really need some DS so much this year, but I will say this for the Bomani fans,

3286
02:32:46,120 --> 02:32:52,120
the arcade finally had an actual version of Pop'n Music, not Animelo 2, thankfully.

3287
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:55,120
Hmm. Alright.

3288
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:56,120
Oh, that's...

3289
02:32:56,120 --> 02:32:57,120
No, go ahead.

3290
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:00,120
Yeah, instead of Pop'n Music, Animelo 2 did Pop'n 14.

3291
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:04,120
That's good. That's definitely worthwhile.

3292
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:10,120
How about anime stuff? I know we don't talk a lot about anime on this show, but did you see some cool stuff going on?

3293
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:14,120
Like, any cool panels that you saw? I know we weren't there this year, but...

3294
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:19,120
I went to one gathering, but it wasn't as good as the same one from last year,

3295
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:27,120
and I went to a panel called Bonstar Cave. This is a video game trivia show panel thingy, and it was pretty awesome.

3296
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:33,120
That's one thing I really want to get into doing, these cons, these game show type things, because I think it would be a lot of fun.

3297
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:40,120
Like, a lot of references to older video games, like 16-bit video games,

3298
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:49,120
like, your questions are represented by enemies, and so do enemies, or versions of enemies from older games,

3299
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:53,120
like Mr. Batty from Earthbound, or Dr. Robotnik with 12 balls and chains,

3300
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:58,120
or this Labyrinth Zone dance party thing where if you get the question right, it ends,

3301
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:02,120
but if you get it wrong, you get a sonic drowning if you get it drowned.

3302
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:06,120
Interesting. Some people have a lot of time. A lot of free time on their hands.

3303
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:11,120
You know what's... I gotta say this, because I don't think I ever said this about Anime Central when I was talking about this,

3304
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:19,120
that was the most recent con I went to, but one of the panels that they were supposed to do was, like, live recreations of cases from Phoenix Wright,

3305
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:23,120
where they were going to basically do the cases from Phoenix Wright as a play, at least that's how it read in the book.

3306
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:28,120
I remember that one, and even though I went to the Ace Attorney gathering...

3307
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:34,120
It was not what we thought it would be. We tried to go there to the panel, and it was hard to hear,

3308
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:39,120
they weren't really reading off a script, they were just kind of making it up, it seems we left after five minutes, it wasn't...

3309
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:44,120
We were like, god damn it, this seemed so much better in the panel, like, this could have been epic!

3310
02:34:44,120 --> 02:34:48,120
Objection! You know, they could have gone off the script from the game and it would have been beautiful.

3311
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:58,120
Yeah, what else... I went to the cosplay chess, which is like, basically you have a chess board, two people playing chess, and then you have a bigger chess board,

3312
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:05,120
where they represent the chess gameplay on the huge board with cosplayers, that was pretty fun.

3313
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:09,120
Any good video game cosplay that you saw?

3314
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:17,120
A whole lot, hold on, let me just post my pictures from the bottom in the chat room.

3315
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:22,120
It has a chat.orangelaungeradio.com, if you want to check that out, I see the link there.

3316
02:35:22,120 --> 02:35:31,120
Yeah, I saw a few video game cosplay gatherings, and I cosplayed as a character myself, and that was kind of funny.

3317
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:39,120
Like, I went to my apologizes cosplay, and a lot of people recognized me, and I went to my pop-in cosplay, and only three people recognized me.

3318
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:42,120
Then again, I wasn't really surprised.

3319
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:46,120
What would you say was the best video game cosplay you saw?

3320
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:48,120
I'm not sure.

3321
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:51,120
Like...

3322
02:35:51,120 --> 02:36:03,120
Yeah, I saw Captain Commander cosplay, and that was pretty cool, because the cosplayer had neon lights on his costume, which was awesome.

3323
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:08,120
Alright, fair enough. Well, gs68, any other thoughts about Phantom 8 before we let you go and take some more calls?

3324
02:36:08,120 --> 02:36:17,120
Um, yeah, I went to YaliCon Bingo for the hell of it. I didn't win anything, but...

3325
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:19,120
YaliCon Bingo.

3326
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:20,120
Yes.

3327
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:26,120
This sounds like one of those things I have to experience at least once in my life. I've heard of YaliCon for probably ten years now, and I've never really gone.

3328
02:36:26,120 --> 02:36:27,120
You probably should.

3329
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:30,120
I've been to YaliCon before, Rob, it's interesting.

3330
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:31,120
Maybe at some point.

3331
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:36,120
Yeah, I might go to YaliCon this year, but only for one day. Same with that anime summer version.

3332
02:36:36,120 --> 02:36:41,120
Oh, okay. Well, maybe we haven't had sac animes in our neck of the woods, we haven't been there in forever. We'll see.

3333
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:48,120
Alright, we gotta let you go though so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much gs68, I'm glad to hear you had a fun time at Phantom 8, and we should be back next year.

3334
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:50,120
Alright, see you next year then.

3335
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:51,120
Later!

3336
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:56,120
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3337
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:57,120
Hey, it's Rama.

3338
02:36:57,120 --> 02:36:58,120
Hey Rama, how you doing?

3339
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:59,120
Hi!

3340
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:00,120
Not much.

3341
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:02,120
Scott, I have a bit of a bone to pick with you now.

3342
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:04,120
Oh, Jesus, what?

3343
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:09,120
Not all spam is bad. Sometimes it's pretty tasty between a couple slices of bread.

3344
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:12,120
I hate you.

3345
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:14,120
You know what I meant.

3346
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:18,120
I know, but you opened the door for me. You don't do that.

3347
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:23,120
I did. Hey, you got me back for the purple spaceship from earlier in the show, so there you go.

3348
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:25,120
Oh, that was a good play. I loved it. That was a good play.

3349
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:31,120
The chat room is telling me to hang up on you for that, so you better talk quick to save yourself. What else is on your mind?

3350
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,120
Two words. Anime Boston.

3351
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:37,120
Alright, how was Anime Boston?

3352
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:45,120
Seriously, it lacked. It just didn't have the same oomph or feeling as the last Anime Boston that I've attended.

3353
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:49,120
You know, I've been going since the first year.

3354
02:37:49,120 --> 02:37:59,120
I would guess it probably lacked because every year it's so packed full of people, it takes you instead of like 10 minutes to get from point A to point B, maybe 20 minutes.

3355
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:05,120
Now it takes five minutes. I'm just guessing because they've redesigned the logistics of where everything was this year.

3356
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:12,120
Let me ask you a question that came up last week. One of our other listeners went to Anime Boston. We were kind of grilling him on it a little bit.

3357
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:23,120
And one thing that we asked about was the location, because apparently the place that they have Anime Boston is where they're going to have Penny Arcade Expo East Coast version is the same venue.

3358
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:26,120
Will it fit?

3359
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:39,120
I've been saying no, no, and no. Because the convention center holds like maybe we're between 10,000 to 15,000 people and AB has hit anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 and it has been jam-packed.

3360
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:51,120
If they do it right, they may be able to pull it off. If not, when you get there late Friday afternoon or Friday evening, don't be too surprised to see signs on the door that says fail to capacity due to fire code.

3361
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:58,120
Wow. Rob D. in chat clarifies they are estimating 20,000 people for PAX East. They're insane.

3362
02:38:58,120 --> 02:39:10,120
And if that's the case, the Hines might just be able to pull it off. It is three floors. It's not tremendously huge as like the Baltimore Convention Center which can hold about 24,000 people.

3363
02:39:10,120 --> 02:39:12,120
I can see the Hines maybe half that.

3364
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:18,120
They'll probably spill into some neighboring facilities and some of the hotels that I imagine are right nearby there. Like that's kind of what ASEN does.

3365
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:25,120
They have the convention center, but they also spill into the nearby hotels. So I'm sure PAX will do something like that if there's that much demand there.

3366
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:31,120
Yeah, because it's like there's two hotels attached to the Hind and there's two more hotels within walking distance.

3367
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:40,120
Interesting. Anything else on your mind tonight? Actually, I want to ask you real quick, what did you see on a Boston GamingWise that you wanted to share with us?

3368
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:43,120
DDR4thMix Plus Machine.

3369
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:45,120
Epic win. I missed that one.

3370
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:52,120
And I also discovered what the whole Nintendo booth was and since you went to ASEN, you probably saw it too.

3371
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:53,120
Hmm.

3372
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:55,120
You didn't see it?

3373
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:57,120
No, the Nintendo booth?

3374
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:01,120
Yeah, it was in the dealer's room. They had a complete display for Fire Emblem.

3375
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:05,120
Yes, they did. They were selling the hell out of that new Fire Emblem game, yeah.

3376
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:07,120
Yes, yes it was.

3377
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:16,120
Indeed. I keep forgetting that I thought that was the makers, I guess it was Nintendo publishing it, but I thought for some reason, I don't know, it didn't click on my mind. I'm slow.

3378
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:20,120
But yeah, I definitely saw that on the floor. They were a very popular booth.

3379
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:25,120
Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you go to get in some more calls and then go wrap up the show, so thanks so much for calling, okay?

3380
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:27,120
No problem. Take care, guys.

3381
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:28,120
Later, bud.

3382
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:29,120
Later.

3383
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:32,120
Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype.

3384
02:40:32,120 --> 02:40:36,120
Orange Lounge Radio is the phone number to call.

3385
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:41,120
We'll take a few more calls before we leave you guys tonight.

3386
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:47,120
I just answered one and they hung up right away. I think somebody is redialing so fast that they're not actually able to get through.

3387
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:50,120
I think we got one call here, though. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3388
02:40:50,120 --> 02:40:52,120
This is Ingo.

3389
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:56,120
Hey, Ingo! Good, I was wondering how to say that. What's on your mind, Ingo?

3390
02:40:56,120 --> 02:41:08,120
Nothing really much. I was wondering, is it worth 200 bucks to get a 360? I already have a PS3, but I was just wondering.

3391
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:14,120
The golden rule of gaming, we've said time and again here on Orange Lounge Radio, is a console is only as good as the games that are on it.

3392
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:18,120
You have to really look at what's available on the Xbox 360, and you have to look.

3393
02:41:18,120 --> 02:41:25,120
Are these games that I can't get on the PlayStation 3, or are these games giving me an experience I can't get on the PlayStation 3?

3394
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:28,120
I'm phrasing it like that to you because you already own a PlayStation 3.

3395
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:33,120
Most people are usually going the other way around where they already have the Xbox and want to get the PlayStation 3.

3396
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:36,120
Or they don't have either of them and they want to know which one of the two to buy.

3397
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:42,120
Usually I push people towards the Xbox 360 because they have, in my opinion, the better exclusives.

3398
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:47,120
Whereas, if you're looking for a multimedia thing, the PlayStation 3 obviously has the Blu-ray.

3399
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:51,120
It's got the better web and all that stuff. It makes a better multimedia box.

3400
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:56,120
But since you already have that, you're really going to have to look at the Xbox exclusive games.

3401
02:41:56,120 --> 02:42:05,120
Are you somebody that plays Halo? Are you somebody that plays Mass Effect 1 and some of these other games that are exclusive on Xbox 360?

3402
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:07,120
I'm having a total brain lapse right now. What are some of the other games?

3403
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:08,120
Here's a War.

3404
02:42:08,120 --> 02:42:10,120
Here's a War. DDR Universe.

3405
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:11,120
Fable 2.

3406
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:14,120
Yeah. Are these games of interest to you?

3407
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:19,120
No, I'll have to think about it for a little bit. Just some exclusive games.

3408
02:42:19,120 --> 02:42:22,120
Well, here's my question to you and you should ask yourself the same thing.

3409
02:42:22,120 --> 02:42:28,120
If I were to drop $200 on Xbox 360, what would be the first game I'd play on it?

3410
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:31,120
For me, it'd probably be Grand Theft Auto IV.

3411
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:37,120
Well, there you go. But see, Grand Theft Auto IV is also a game that you can get on the PlayStation 3.

3412
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:40,120
But, of course, Xbox 360 also has the multiplayer.

3413
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:46,120
Well, they have the multiplayer in the PS3 as well. They have the expansions. That's pretty much it for right now.

3414
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:50,120
The multiplayer on the PS3 sucks.

3415
02:42:50,120 --> 02:42:56,120
Are you happy with the PlayStation 3 or are you a little disgruntled with where they've gone with it?

3416
02:42:56,120 --> 02:43:01,120
And that's why you're thinking about maybe going to Xbox?

3417
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:08,120
I'm really happy with my PS3 because, well, yeah, I don't know why.

3418
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:14,120
But, no, I really shouldn't until it sort of went down.

3419
02:43:14,120 --> 02:43:18,120
But, yeah, I got a 500GB PS3 now, so...

3420
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:22,120
Nice, a modded PS3. And, hey, maybe you can get one of those phones where you can stream your pornography

3421
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:25,120
at anywhere you want in the world over 3G.

3422
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:27,120
No, I'm not one of those people.

3423
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:31,120
All right. I'm trying to think of what else I want to ask you in regards to this...

3424
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:36,120
Wait until after E3 and that's all their new games. You can see if there's anything that tickles your fancy.

3425
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:38,120
You know what? That's a really good point as well.

3426
02:43:38,120 --> 02:43:43,120
With all these rumors of the motion control device and everything that Xbox is supposed to be coming out,

3427
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:45,120
maybe that's going to be your incentive.

3428
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:47,120
And there also might be a price drop or two.

3429
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:52,120
So definitely don't buy anything until at least after, what, noon tomorrow after the press conference is done.

3430
02:43:52,120 --> 02:43:54,120
They're just waiting till the holidays.

3431
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:56,120
Yeah, if you can wait that long.

3432
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:59,120
If you were to tell me that, Loki, and I really wanted an Xbox 360, I'd be like,

3433
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:01,120
No, I can't wait that long. I want it now.

3434
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:04,120
I'll pay the extra 100 bucks. I don't care. I want it now.

3435
02:44:04,120 --> 02:44:07,120
I mean, any of us that buy a console the first day it comes out,

3436
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:09,120
we all know the damn thing is going to drop.

3437
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:11,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

3438
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:14,120
Who was it that paid how much for an Xbox 360?

3439
02:44:14,120 --> 02:44:15,120
$700.

3440
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:16,120
That's what I thought. Thank you very much.

3441
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:17,120
I also own five of them.

3442
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:19,120
Thank you very much. Case in point.

3443
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:21,120
Sorry, Ingo.

3444
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:23,120
Well, good luck to you.

3445
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:26,120
I hope you are able to figure it out.

3446
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:30,120
And let us know if you do end up buying the Xbox 360 and what you do play on it.

3447
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:32,120
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

3448
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:39,120
Um, Loki, you should check your friend requests on your PS3.

3449
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:46,120
I haven't been on my PS3. Well, I have been on my PS3, but not browsing games.

3450
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:48,120
We've been streaming the porn.

3451
02:44:48,120 --> 02:44:49,120
Watching porn, exactly.

3452
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:51,120
We've been streaming movies out of it.

3453
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:53,120
But yeah, I haven't been on PlayStation Network in a while.

3454
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:56,120
Black Wolf would like to remind everybody that he is Loki's only friend.

3455
02:44:56,120 --> 02:44:58,120
Not anymore, Black Wolf. Sorry.

3456
02:44:58,120 --> 02:45:01,120
Oh, you cheated on him. I would cry if I were Bobby.

3457
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:03,120
Alright, Ingo, we're going to let you go to get a couple more calls and get out of here.

3458
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:05,120
But have a good night, okay?

3459
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:06,120
You too.

3460
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:07,120
Later, bud.

3461
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:10,120
What was I going to say? The Rob D. in chat says, because Motion on the 360...

3462
02:45:10,120 --> 02:45:12,120
Oh, actually, this is his call.

3463
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:14,120
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3464
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:15,120
What's up, guys? It's the Rob D.

3465
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:17,120
I was just about to read one of your comments in chat.

3466
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:21,120
You put, because Motion on the 360 is going to be good. Laugh.

3467
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:22,120
Yeah, I know.

3468
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:24,120
What if it is? What if it is, Rob?

3469
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:29,120
Um, then I'll gladly eat ecro, but I really doubt it's actually going to be good.

3470
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:31,120
You really think it's going to be anything more than a gimmick?

3471
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:33,120
It's a cup of mayonnaise tonight, Rob.

3472
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:35,120
I don't know if you were here earlier in the night.

3473
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:38,120
Honestly, there is going to be a motion controller regardless of this camera thing,

3474
02:45:38,120 --> 02:45:46,120
because the third-party game accessory developer, PDP, is putting out their Magic Wand controller thing.

3475
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:49,120
It has a game that comes with it called Squeeballs.

3476
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:51,120
And it looks like the Wii remote.

3477
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:56,120
As long as I can waggle my Squeeballs, I'll be good.

3478
02:45:56,120 --> 02:46:01,120
Wow. You know, there could be something good out of this. I don't know.

3479
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:03,120
You know, it might be a hell of a party thing.

3480
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:07,120
I don't think it's something I'm going to sit there and play in the room by myself,

3481
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:09,120
look at me flailing about like an asshole.

3482
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:11,120
Oh my god, did we get a totem ball sequel?

3483
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:13,120
Can I buy another useless camera?

3484
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:17,120
I'd somehow don't think Rob called in tonight to talk about Microsoft Motion Control.

3485
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:20,120
Let me turn it over to Rob. What's on your mind tonight?

3486
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:23,120
Well, I have to ask you guys to bear with me a little bit, because I'm currently sick,

3487
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:25,120
and I'm coughing all over the place.

3488
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:28,120
I have no voice, and I've been doing the show all night tonight, so it's fine.

3489
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:32,120
Would you like your third convention report of the night, since I went to Anime North in Toronto?

3490
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:36,120
Apparently we are the convention hub on the internet.

3491
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:37,120
I guess so.

3492
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:41,120
We should just name ourselves the convention cast. That's all right. How was it?

3493
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:44,120
It was fun. Toronto is actually a really cool city.

3494
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:46,120
It's the first time I've been there in about a decade,

3495
02:46:46,120 --> 02:46:50,120
and though they don't really care too much for copyright infringement,

3496
02:46:50,120 --> 02:46:54,120
as you can see from the picture I just posted in chat, which is hilarious,

3497
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:58,120
it was a great place to have a convention, even though it was a little bit outside the city,

3498
02:46:58,120 --> 02:47:03,120
but I managed to have a friend show me around anyway.

3499
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:05,120
So you actually got to see the city when you went to the convention,

3500
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:09,120
because when I went to Chicago, I saw a little bit of downtown.

3501
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,120
That was when we got lost one night. That was about it.

3502
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:15,120
Wow, I'm looking at this picture. Mario Brothers Fast Foods, apparently.

3503
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:19,120
Totally unrelated to the Mario Brothers. They're the Mario Bros.

3504
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:23,120
Do they serve Mario broth soup there or something? What the hell?

3505
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,120
I don't know. You can actually see they're under renovation.

3506
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:31,120
I would have totally eaten there, but I decided to eat this little concoction for lunch instead,

3507
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:33,120
something called poutine.

3508
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:36,120
Oh, God, yes, I've heard of this. That's the Canadian, it's like the French fries and gravy, right?

3509
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:37,120
Yeah, it's fantastic.

3510
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:42,120
French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. If that doesn't stop your heart, I don't know what will.

3511
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:43,120
It's a beautiful stuff.

3512
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:44,120
But either way, the convention, though.

3513
02:47:44,120 --> 02:47:48,120
Instant pancreas attack right there if I eat that. All right, sorry, convention, yes.

3514
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:53,120
The Friday was kind of interesting because I saw on the schedule that they had something called Anime Pro Wrestling,

3515
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:57,120
and I thought it was a total joke, but no, they actually got some independent wrestling promotion

3516
02:47:57,120 --> 02:48:04,120
to actually have Anime Pro Wrestling, and they had me when they had Scorpion and Sub-Zero versus Inspector Gumshoe

3517
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,120
and the guy from Helsing, so...

3518
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:08,120
Wow.

3519
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:13,120
Video game related, the game room, I know this is a theme with me lately, but the game room kind of sucked.

3520
02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:17,120
You know how you said it's great when the conventions actually spill over into the surrounding hotels?

3521
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:18,120
Mm-hmm.

3522
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:21,120
It's not so great when that surrounding hotel is a half mile away.

3523
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:23,120
Oh, yeah, that's not good.

3524
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:28,120
That sounds very Anime Expo, which is why I quit going.

3525
02:48:28,120 --> 02:48:32,120
Yeah, I went over there for most of Saturday, and of course they ended up scrapping the Street Fighter IV tournament

3526
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:38,120
three hours after it was supposed to start, but I'm not bitter, not at all.

3527
02:48:38,120 --> 02:48:44,120
I went there on the Morian, all they had to play was Brawl, a pinball game on the PS2, I don't even know what it was,

3528
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:49,120
and SBC Chaos, oh, and Ikaruga, which is, I guess that's fun.

3529
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:54,120
But the real highlight of the convention was me taking a picture with the voice of Link, Nobuyuki Hiyama,

3530
02:48:54,120 --> 02:48:59,120
and the voice of Joe Higashi, the voice of Vyral, the voice of Siegfried from Soul Calibur.

3531
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:02,120
They got some pretty good celebs up there in Canadian, don't they?

3532
02:49:02,120 --> 02:49:04,120
I know, right?

3533
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:05,120
Wow.

3534
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:06,120
That was a ton of fun.

3535
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:09,120
I'm looking at the picture right now, there you are, there he is.

3536
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:11,120
Too bad it wasn't the voice of Navi.

3537
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:16,120
Hey, listen, hey, listen, I would love to get that person to do a bumper for OLR.

3538
02:49:16,120 --> 02:49:22,120
Hey, listen, hey, listen, to OLR.

3539
02:49:22,120 --> 02:49:25,120
Sorry, I don't know what the hell possessed me for that.

3540
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:34,120
Alright, so on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blow your mind, awesome, con of the year, like, better than Penny Arcade Expo,

3541
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:39,120
1 being, oh my god, this sucked, where would you rate this convention?

3542
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:42,120
I'd rate it at about a solid 8, I expect Otacon to be better,

3543
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:48,120
because last year at Otacon was just a really great experience, and especially since I have a panel at Otacon this year, it's going to be a ton of fun.

3544
02:49:48,120 --> 02:49:50,120
Of course, that makes everything better. Rob D panel makes everything better.

3545
02:49:50,120 --> 02:49:52,120
The only thing better than a Rob D panel?

3546
02:49:52,120 --> 02:49:54,120
Is a Sky panel.

3547
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:55,120
That's right.

3548
02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:57,120
I'm just messing.

3549
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:02,120
Alright, Rob, we've got to let you go so we can go wrap up the show, but thank you for making our show now with more Poutin.

3550
02:50:02,120 --> 02:50:03,120
I appreciate that.

3551
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,120
You know it.

3552
02:50:04,120 --> 02:50:05,120
Alright, take care.

3553
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:06,120
You always need more French fries and cheese carrots.

3554
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:07,120
Alright, take care, buddy.

3555
02:50:07,120 --> 02:50:08,120
See you later, man.

3556
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:09,120
Bye.

3557
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:16,120
Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skyline tonight. Sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're at about 9.20 in between this and our afterbirth and everything.

3558
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:18,120
We don't want to be here too late tonight.

3559
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:21,120
So, we're going to go ahead and go around and wrap everything up.

3560
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:23,120
Again, remember, if you guys didn't get through, we do need more emails always.

3561
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:26,120
Put Jamie to work. Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com is the place to send him.

3562
02:50:26,120 --> 02:50:28,120
Hey, I'm not here to work.

3563
02:50:28,120 --> 02:50:30,120
Alright, Dark Sakura, I'm going to make you work right now.

3564
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:32,120
Oh, actually, I want to go around and see if there's any last-minute stories.

3565
02:50:32,120 --> 02:50:34,120
I know it was a busy Newsweek. Do you have anything, Dark Sakura?

3566
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:35,120
I don't.

3567
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:37,120
Loki, I know you've got to have something.

3568
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:39,120
Yes, I do. Of course.

3569
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:41,120
Just some last-minute stories.

3570
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:44,120
ESRB is rated Final Fantasy VII for the PS3 and the PSP.

3571
02:50:44,120 --> 02:50:45,120
What?

3572
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:50,120
Basically, the PlayStation Network version of it where you can download the PlayStation 1 game.

3573
02:50:50,120 --> 02:50:59,120
Most people's guess is that it's going to come out with the release of the Blu-ray of Final Fantasy Advent Children Complete since that's when it came out in Japan.

3574
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:01,120
So, in a few more weeks.

3575
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:09,120
Another surprise Sony-related. Apparently, there was a Sony PlayStation blog E3 2009 meetup in LA.

3576
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:15,120
Well, apparently, the first hundred people in line also got E3 passes, so lucky them.

3577
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:19,120
Let's see here.

3578
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:23,120
That is very lucky. I would like to know if any of our listeners were one of those hundred people.

3579
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:26,120
Remember, I'm looking for hugs at E3 if you are.

3580
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:31,120
There's a rumor to another game being announced for the Halo series.

3581
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:42,120
Apparently, from the Bungie blog, their search engine has a drop-down where you can search specific forums, and one of those forums was Halo Reach.

3582
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:46,120
And that's different than, I guess, the Halo 3 forum and the Halo ODST.

3583
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:48,120
And certainly a better name than Halo Reach around.

3584
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:50,120
Yes, it is.

3585
02:51:50,120 --> 02:52:01,120
Ubisoft is bringing more game show based games to the Wii, including Press Your Luck, Family Feud, and they're going to do another Price is Right game.

3586
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:02,120
Fuck no.

3587
02:52:02,120 --> 02:52:04,120
Price is Right is pretty...

3588
02:52:04,120 --> 02:52:07,120
I'm just kidding. I haven't played the Price is Right game.

3589
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:08,120
It might be interesting.

3590
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:10,120
By the way, completely unrelated, but I have to ask.

3591
02:52:10,120 --> 02:52:18,120
Did anyone see that clip on the internet of the Price is Right episode from last week where this contestant got so excited she jumped up on Drew Carey and kneed him in the balls?

3592
02:52:18,120 --> 02:52:19,120
Oh my god.

3593
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:21,120
Like it was an accident thing. She didn't mean to do it.

3594
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:23,120
But she totally kneed him in the balls and took him down.

3595
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:25,120
Like he was like, oh my god.

3596
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:27,120
I think it was on TMZ or something if you have to see it.

3597
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:28,120
It's hilarious.

3598
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:29,120
Sorry, completely random.

3599
02:52:29,120 --> 02:52:31,120
But fuck yes to Press Your Luck.

3600
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:41,120
They have a Splinter Cell banner, of course, outside of the LA Convention Center kind of confirming still that it's an Xbox 360 exclusive.

3601
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:43,120
No big surprise there.

3602
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:47,120
And some other homebrew stuff actually interesting.

3603
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:51,120
There's a project someone's working on called Metroid 2.5.

3604
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:56,120
It's going to be kind of a 2.5D version of Metroid 2 and kind of 3.

3605
02:52:56,120 --> 02:53:00,120
Oh, in other words, what Metroid on the GameCube should have been, in my opinion.

3606
02:53:00,120 --> 02:53:03,120
There's a lot of Prime fans that would disagree with me.

3607
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:05,120
It's quite different than what you would think.

3608
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:17,120
It's actually really weird. Like Super Paper Mario almost, but not Metroid. Mega Man, I'm sorry. Mega Man 2.5.

3609
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:20,120
Oh, well, you changed everything.

3610
02:53:20,120 --> 02:53:21,120
Not Metroid.

3611
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:26,120
No, there is still a Metroid 2.5 type of game that's coming out that someone's making.

3612
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:28,120
That Metroid 2 fusion thing.

3613
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:30,120
That looked interesting.

3614
02:53:30,120 --> 02:53:35,120
And then there is another homebrew game that's coming out on the DS.

3615
02:53:35,120 --> 02:53:38,120
Someone's porting Patapon to the DS.

3616
02:53:38,120 --> 02:53:41,120
It actually looks kind of cool. They have some gameplay footage of that online.

3617
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:48,120
And also, you may remember there was a Chrono Trigger sequel that someone was making out of a hacked ROM.

3618
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:54,120
Chrono Trigger, Crimson Echoes, and Square Enix had kind of put a stop to that game.

3619
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:56,120
Well, the ROM leaked out.

3620
02:53:56,120 --> 02:54:01,120
I fucking told you this would happen. I fucking said it that night that we covered this story.

3621
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:07,120
It's going to leak anyway, and they're going to be like, oops, I didn't know, sorry guys, didn't know, didn't mean to.

3622
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:09,120
We all knew it was going to come out anyway.

3623
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:14,120
Originally, they thought it was going to be the 98% finished version of it, but now it's an alpha version of it.

3624
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:16,120
So it's not complete, but it's...

3625
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:17,120
Oh, well...

3626
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:18,120
Complete enough?

3627
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:19,120
...tricky around it.

3628
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:22,120
No, you wait. There will be a 100% version that shows up soon enough.

3629
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:23,120
Just you wait.

3630
02:54:23,120 --> 02:54:24,120
Yeah.

3631
02:54:24,120 --> 02:54:27,120
They'll be able to get away with it. Oh, well, we followed the seasons. We didn't know.

3632
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:30,120
And is Squeenus going to lose any money? No.

3633
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:33,120
So if they just go after these guys, they're just going to be jerks.

3634
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,120
Asses?

3635
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:39,120
Yeah, so yeah, I am not surprised one bit that that came out.

3636
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:42,120
And there's millions of people downloading it now, I'm sure.

3637
02:54:42,120 --> 02:54:43,120
Millions of Chrono Trigger games.

3638
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:44,120
I better include myself.

3639
02:54:44,120 --> 02:54:47,120
I know. I'm like, things to do when I get home.

3640
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:53,120
And then finally, there's a new music game coming out from the founders of Rockstar Games.

3641
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:58,120
Actually, the founders of the developer did Grand Theft Auto, the original game.

3642
02:54:58,120 --> 02:55:01,120
4 millimeters, I guess, is the studio.

3643
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:05,120
And apparently, they have a game called Def Jam Rapstar.

3644
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:09,120
Kind of the urban version of Singstar, if you will.

3645
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:11,120
That will be at E3.

3646
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:12,120
Yippee.

3647
02:55:12,120 --> 02:55:13,120
And that's it.

3648
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:17,120
Alright. We're getting out of here. We're done for the night.

3649
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:18,120
Are we?

3650
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:20,120
We gotta wrap up, yeah. We gotta do our live-only segment real quick.

3651
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:23,120
And then get out of here. It's almost 10 o'clock on the west coast, if you can believe it.

3652
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:26,120
Long show tonight, but we had a lot of news. What did you expect?

3653
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:28,120
Really? I mean, we've got E3 coming up.

3654
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:29,120
Exactly.

3655
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:30,120
Wait till next time.

3656
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:34,120
And if we are here next Sunday, which I don't see why we wouldn't be, but we'll see.

3657
02:55:34,120 --> 02:55:35,120
We'll see, yeah.

3658
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:38,120
Maybe like a short show Sunday. That's what I'm thinking is gonna happen.

3659
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:40,120
Maybe we'll do, well, we'll talk.

3660
02:55:40,120 --> 02:55:43,120
Because I know Bobby might want to go along because this is his 200th show.

3661
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:44,120
We'll worry about it later.

3662
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:48,120
I know we gotta do some type of E3 impression show. We've got to.

3663
02:55:48,120 --> 02:55:51,120
And Dark Sakura, since you're not going, you gotta keep an eye on it from home.

3664
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:52,120
I guess.

3665
02:55:52,120 --> 02:55:54,120
And keep an eye on all the blogs and all that fun stuff.

3666
02:55:54,120 --> 02:55:55,120
I guess.

3667
02:55:55,120 --> 02:56:01,120
Alright. Anyhow, let's see. We're gonna wrap up and get on out of here.

3668
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:05,120
Everybody's final thought tonight. Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Your final thought?

3669
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:08,120
I made my garage too big.

3670
02:56:08,120 --> 02:56:10,120
Loki, your final thought?

3671
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:13,120
I have to play more fuel and then kill some sims.

3672
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:19,120
My final thought is I gotta check out this fuel as well and I'm looking forward to going to E3.

3673
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:22,120
And remember I'm looking for hugs and just to meet more people.

3674
02:56:22,120 --> 02:56:26,120
So if you do happen to see me out there at E3, please stop and say hello.

3675
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:27,120
I'm not-

3676
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:28,120
Post it.

3677
02:56:28,120 --> 02:56:31,120
I promise I'm not mean. Just come up and say hi. Introduce yourself.

3678
02:56:31,120 --> 02:56:34,120
Ask anyone who met me at ASEN or anything. I swear I'm not mean.

3679
02:56:34,120 --> 02:56:35,120
Like I will-

3680
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:36,120
But I am.

3681
02:56:36,120 --> 02:56:38,120
Yes, but Loki is, so avoid him at all costs.

3682
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:39,120
I am too.

3683
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:43,120
But if I'm with Loki, then you're okay because I will keep him in check and he won't be mean to you.

3684
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:48,120
Alright, in reality, actually Loki is one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. It's just a radio persona.

3685
02:56:48,120 --> 02:56:49,120
It's all a lie.

3686
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:51,120
It's all a lie. I'm absolutely mean.

3687
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:56,120
I hate to break it to you guys here, but the mean guy persona is all a lie.

3688
02:56:56,120 --> 02:57:02,120
Ah, great. They're gonna have Tony Arx right at the Microsoft E3 keynote. That's gonna be boring to watch.

3689
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:08,120
Hooray. Maybe that's why they suddenly did the five minute increase or whatever in time.

3690
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:12,120
The Rob Dean chat says, Sky punched me in the face and threw a drink at me.

3691
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:15,120
In true diva fashion.

3692
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:19,120
Alright, no really, we're out of here. Thanks you guys. Have a wonderful night.

3693
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:24,120
Thank you as always for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and our little show here.

3694

Remember, if you like the show, all we ask is to tell two people about our little show here.

3695
02:57:28,120 --> 02:57:31,120
And to help spread the word because word of mouth is all we got.

3696
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:34,120
