0	19280	Today, May 17, 2009, the studio behind Duke Nukem Forever closes.
19280	21480	Details are revealed on Guitar Hero 5.
21480	31640	And could a popular import fighting game be U.S. bound?
31640	35780	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
35780	36880	Lounge Radio.
36880	41800	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
41800	42800	lifestyle.
42800	45400	That's right, we're back May 17, 2009.
45400	47980	We were off last week, that was my bad.
47980	51200	This is Rob Roberts here with you every week on the show, except last week.
51200	55040	Joining us, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
55040	56800	What are you doing in my house?
56800	57800	I'm sorry.
57800	60800	Yes, we have a studio change tonight, which is kind of interesting.
60800	68080	The AC at Studio Roberts broke, so now we're here at Studio Dark Sakura, and it's kind
68080	69960	of different, but good.
69960	74180	I'm hoping the sound is still the same and everybody is hearing things like they were
74180	75580	before.
75580	78620	This is kind of nice though, because in this compacted space, I'm able to adjust audio
78620	83160	a little easier as we go, so hopefully there's no popping and breaking tonight on the show.
83160	84160	We'll see.
84160	86160	Although I think Dark Sakura might have been a little loud, but that's all right.
86160	87540	We'll fix these things as we go.
87540	88540	It's live radio.
88540	89540	What can you do?
89540	92800	You just have to kind of fix things as they come up, but we'll still be taking your calls.
92800	97920	We're wired for everything except Justin TV, sadly.
97920	101540	We have to say goodbye to Justin TV for tonight, but we're hoping to get that back in a future
101540	102920	week.
102920	107440	We might actually relocate within the relocation for the summer into a bigger space here in
107440	108440	the house.
108440	109440	We'll see.
109440	112680	Anyway, I won't bore you with the details, but I will bore you with the one and only
112680	113680	tech master, Loki.
113680	114680	Hello.
114680	116400	How are you doing, Loki?
116400	117400	Could be better.
117400	118400	Oh, really?
118400	123120	I'm sitting on a step stool that's as hard as a rock.
123120	124120	We'll figure it out.
124120	126500	Maybe at the halfway point we can switch and you can stay on.
126500	129560	We can get you a chair for next week.
129560	131000	We'll figure something out.
131000	132000	We'll work it out.
132000	137600	Anyhow, we're back, and of course we have a little time to catch up on, so we'll play
137600	140400	a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, because that's how we always start things
140400	141400	off.
141400	142400	So How Was Your Gaming Week?
142400	146000	Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?
146000	150320	Well, I played Sims.
150320	151320	Sims 2.
151320	152320	That's about it.
152320	155400	Do you like to torture your Sims, or do you actually play it legitimately?
155400	161160	I actually have been tweaking my Sims to try to put more stuff, modding more this, that,
161160	164560	and the other, and now I have a dirty object.
164560	169840	So, just to see how it worked, and now I'm curious.
169840	170840	Okay.
170840	171840	We'll leave it at that then, I suppose.
171840	172840	Yes.
172840	174480	Are you excited for Sims 3?
174480	175480	Kind of.
175480	178280	I was looking on the Twitter earlier, and looking at the friends list on the Twitter,
178280	181680	and apparently some of our listeners are pretty excited, because I guess Sims 3 just leaked
181680	185480	out, so some folks are already downloading that and having fun with it.
185480	186480	Really?
186480	187480	Uh-oh.
187480	188480	No, not during the show.
188480	189480	Yeah, not during the show.
189480	196440	Leave it to Loki in five minutes to try and pirate something from the new location, geez.
196440	197440	And share.
197440	198440	Alright.
198440	203440	I'm not surprised, though, especially with, although I am surprised it's so early, a lot
203440	204920	of EA leaks this week.
204920	207520	But of course, Loki will buy the game if he enjoys it.
207520	208520	Of course I will.
208520	209520	Alright.
209520	210520	Anyhow.
210520	215240	No, I probably won't enjoy it, though, just like I enjoyed Spore.
215240	221560	I found the case for that today with the DVD inside, and I'm like, oh yeah, I have Spore.
221560	222560	More like Bore.
222560	223560	Alright.
223560	227040	Well, that's it for Dark Cyros gaming week, Loki, how was your gaming week?
227040	232200	My gaming week was pretty brief, I spent most of the week flashing all my drives, upgrading
232200	237960	the drive firmwares in all my 360s, so now instead of having one modded 360, I have four
237960	243320	of the five so far, because the last one which had the light on drive, which is a bitch and
243320	252080	a half the flash, the setup I had didn't want to work with it correctly, and so it was able
252080	258240	to grab the key and that kind of stuff, but I had to actually take my broken 360 and take
258240	260480	that drive and spoof it as the one.
260480	264340	Anyways, so basically I have four modded systems now, and the whole reason we have four modded
264340	269800	systems is because we're playing four modded copies of Grand Theft Auto IV in our company
269800	274880	Deathmatch that we do, and it's all sorts of fun.
274880	278460	Right now we're testing out some of the new weapons that I'm building for it.
278460	283640	One of them is kind of like, I'm calling it the Hurricane Bomb, and basically what it
283640	290000	does is you fire it and it creates a giant physics force that will toss people around.
290000	294240	No damage, but it will throw people and you can throw them into walls and stuff and that
294240	295440	causes damage.
295440	298180	So we've been playing with that and it's absolutely distracting.
298180	299880	You know what kind of weapon you need to make?
299880	304180	And maybe I just have Star Trek on the brain because that movie was so fucking epic.
304180	306880	You need a red matter weapon, that's what you need.
306880	311320	I tried making something- How could you program a singularity in a game?
311320	315080	Something to create a black hole- Something to make the game suck!
315080	317960	There's nothing to create, unfortunately, a negative physics force.
317960	323080	You can sort of, I don't know, the game won't let you do that, because if it could, I've
323080	326880	already thought about that and, you know, a bomb that would explode, suck everything
326880	329960	towards it, which would be pretty sweet.
329960	330960	But that doesn't work.
330960	333880	And I tried creating a flamethrower and that didn't really work as well.
333880	338120	The game's just very sensitive and some of the things I'm trying to make it do causes
338120	340160	the crash and that's not good.
340160	343940	So that's just fun, you know, to basically play against each other.
343940	349280	Really the only reason I need to mod all four systems is because if you put one of the weapons
349280	353520	on- The way it calculates damage and physics and stuff like that, you actually have to
353520	358840	have all the systems modded the same with the same kind of, you know, edits to the game
358840	362200	in order for it to work correctly, because otherwise it just doesn't work.
362200	368640	But yeah, it's been a lot of fun and I'm trying to get some more stuff added into that.
368640	373440	So aside from playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto 4 PC and Lost and Damned on the 360,
373440	379160	I've also been playing Rock Band Unplugged because that somehow leaked online and so,
379160	381240	you know, I have to check it out.
381240	385960	Honestly I'm glad I checked it out this way because I can't see myself purchasing this
385960	386960	game.
386960	389000	I think I get bored with it really fast.
389000	390000	Really?
390000	391000	Why?
391000	392000	Because I get bored with Rock Band pretty fast.
392000	393720	It's just not the same as playing like Rock Band.
393720	398880	I mean it's, you know, frequency amplitude so at least that way they can kind of add
398880	402200	music that would normally not be in like Rock Band, you know, doesn't have to necessarily
402200	403200	be rock music.
403200	406220	They can do electronica and all that sort of stuff.
406220	408480	But I don't know.
408480	412400	Like I spent more time I think customizing my characters than I did actually playing
412400	413400	the game.
413400	414520	And it's alright.
414520	417000	It's what it is I guess.
417000	419560	But I don't know.
419560	420560	It's just alright.
420560	423560	I don't think I'd buy it though.
423560	427140	How does it compare to like frequency and amplitude in all those games we think this
427140	429440	game was inspired by?
429440	433060	Honestly I've never really, I haven't played too much of frequency or amplitude but from
433060	437280	the little that I have played it's pretty much the same type of thing.
437280	441240	You know, except kind of the Rock Band set up where you have the same sort of graphics
441240	445120	that you'd see in Rock Band except you're jumping between three, you know, four different
445120	446120	tracks.
446120	448720	And you are switching a lot through there and that's kind of where I mess up usually
448720	449720	in the songs.
449720	452280	Because the songs themselves aren't that hard.
452280	455040	Obviously I'm not playing on like expert difficulty or anything like that but I'm just playing
455040	457320	on normal difficulty that's in the game.
457320	461720	It's not that hard but it's just, you know, jumping back and forth between tracks.
461720	465960	You know, I miss usually the first note or something like that because I'm like oh crap
465960	469520	oh it doesn't want me to jump here it wants me to jump here and it's like uhh, it's kind
469520	470520	of annoying.
470520	473080	But I don't know, it's alright.
473080	478640	I guess, I mean there's no real good music games on the PSP other than like DJ Max so
478640	482120	you know, more than merrier I guess.
482120	485640	I still kind of want to buy it, we'll see, we'll see.
485640	490180	Okay so my gaming week, before I get to my gaming week since I did kind of invoke Star
490180	495460	Trek I just have to say, oh my god, was that not like the greatest thing ever?
495460	498800	Like that movie was so awesome and like I know there's probably some people out there
498800	502840	that don't really want to hear it because like you know every movie has it's detractors
502840	505760	but I got to tell you, you don't have to be a Trekkie to appreciate Star Trek.
505760	507000	That was the goal I think.
507000	509080	You'll appreciate it more probably if you aren't a Trekkie.
509080	513200	You'll pick up on a lot of in-jokes if you're a Trekkie but I think one thing I like about
513200	517200	what J.J. Abrams did is that they took out, and the writers, they took out a lot of like
517200	519020	the techno talk.
519020	522520	You know, they made it very accessible to anybody and the acting was great.
522520	524480	I was so surprised by the guy who played Kirk.
524480	528360	I think was actually my favorite which is amazing because usually I'm a huge Sylar fan
528360	529880	but I was just kind of thinking about it today.
529880	531600	I do think though that his Spock was pretty hardcore.
531600	534280	Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, he was awesome.
534280	535280	They were all great.
535280	539360	The closest though of anybody was McCoy.
539360	547040	He must have had his séance before you know filming every day and channeled De Force Kelly
547040	551120	because he was perfect and better than being Cupid.
551120	552120	It makes me more excited.
552120	553120	Did you recognize him?
553120	554120	No, I didn't.
554120	555120	No, I didn't.
555120	556120	He was Cupid in Xena.
556120	557120	Okay, okay.
557120	562600	No, I haven't seen Xena in so long but it made me more excited for the Star Trek MMO
562600	567600	because I'm hoping this invigorates a whole new life into Star Trek like I hope we get
567600	571240	a new show like I don't think we'll get a show out of this movie like you know the actors
571240	574480	in this are too big I think to want to do a TV show every week in fact one of them's
574480	578560	already doing a TV show every week but I'm all considering the way that show's gonna
578560	582480	you know kind of headed he may not be doing that TV show much longer true he might be
582480	586440	suddenly available but I'm I'm hoping that at least we'll get a new like you know maybe
586440	591480	something in the next generation canon you know some something after you know that I
591480	594480	just don't want another prequel I'd like to see something later well these aren't this
594480	599760	isn't a prequel I know I don't want spoilery but you know what I mean it's it's I know
599760	606040	I know I just want out there now that you can say it's a franchise reboot yeah that's
606040	610120	that's for sure that's for sure it's very interesting they're talking about that possibly
610120	614800	in the in the sequel they're gonna do Khan again which would be very interesting they
614800	620080	could do Khan the first time around it's we have no Montalban I know it'd be weird we
620080	625120	have no rich Corinthian leather all right anyhow sorry I didn't mean to derail the show
625120	630100	but you know what this this this Star Trek movie being so good makes me excited like
630100	635040	for the game that's coming out you know in a little while and I haven't played the Xbox
635040	638600	Live arcade game that's out there but like the MMO I'm talking about it makes me all
638600	644520	excited for Star Trek I'm making us a race huh I'm making us an official race the olorians
644520	648560	the olorians that'd be awesome and of course my other character is gonna be an Orion side
648560	653760	girl so why not all right anyhow my gaming week though I didn't play a whole lot of new
653760	657360	stuff I've just been kind of busy in my personal life like Dark Sakura but I did get a chance
657360	662840	to check out space invaders extreme on the Xbox Live arcade marketplace which is of course
662840	666640	pretty much a port of the PSP version of the game although there have been some changes
666640	670560	of course now they have the multiplayer mode and things a lot of fun it's fun to play on
670560	674760	my big TV with my big sound system and I think it's great for 10 bucks I think it's a lot
674760	680440	of fun I think the game itself is pretty simple which I think is a good thing I think it's
680440	684920	very easy to get into and you know I think it's a type of game I might want to put some
684920	689120	headphones on and just kind of get sucked into which is weird because you think I'd
689120	693120	enjoy it more on the PSP and I do it's a great PSP game but I like the fact that now it has
693120	697160	some online modes it's kind of expanded on Xbox Live Arcade so is the game worth buying
697160	702120	twice yes I think so I think $10 is a fair price for the game and I think it's fun but
702120	708560	of course I also love retro upgraded classics like you know I loved Pac-Man versus I even
708560	712880	like the new Galaga you know I love these souped up retro games usually you know when
712880	717040	it comes to like Leisure Shoot Larry not so much but you know so a lot of the ones especially
717040	720820	they've been putting out on Xbox Live Arcade lately have been great now one other place
720820	724800	that I did get to play a lot of arcade games this week was I went to of course Anime Central
724800	729080	or Asen for short which is where I was and why we weren't here last week on the show
729080	732080	but they had a little game room set up and I got to play some of the arcade games they
732080	736800	had in there such as BeatMania 2DX Gold I believe it was was in there which is cool
736800	740480	because I hadn't played 2DX in a couple months even though we have one here in town I just
740480	744820	never seemed to check out there and then I also played Guitar Freaks which is interesting
744820	750620	because I haven't played Guitar Freaks in a very long time like the last time I remember
750620	756240	actually playing Guitar Freaks was probably not long after I originally bought Guitar
756240	760760	Hero on the Xbox you know so it's been like a long time and it's kind of interesting that
760760	765920	can your Guitar Hero and Rock Band skill help you improve in Guitar Freaks yes a little
765920	771220	bit except the timing is much different and Guitar Freaks I'm sorry is still not as great
771220	778360	of a game it needs a reboot it needs JJ Abrams to come fix it is what Guitar Freaks needs
778360	783040	Rock Revolution not so much so I don't know if that series is dead or what but it was
783040	786720	it was fun to revisit I mean it does have songs you know if you like the j-rock you
786720	789920	know you're not really going to get a lot of those songs in the games over here but
789920	794480	uh yeah Guitar Freaks stick a fork in it it's pretty much done it needs a reboot like most
794480	799360	Bomani games right now need a reboot JJ Abrams needs to go work for Konami and reboot everything
799360	805440	over there I think except for Metal Gear Solid that franchise is doing alright still he should
805440	810280	be directing Metal Gear Solid movie that'd be amazing but you know that guy's gonna be
810280	816360	in demand now so dream on on that one alright um let's see what else did I play at the con
816360	822480	I watched people playing in the groove 2 and pump it up NX and DDR but there was so many
822480	826720	people playing all those games I was a little disappointed by their console showing though
826720	831240	especially the first night like half their TVs weren't even on and I was like how did
831240	834960	they not have Tatsunoko versus Capcom at an anime convention of course they had it by
834960	839040	Saturday night but a little disappointed in the console showing in their game room but
839040	842440	it got a little better as the con went on I don't know if they had some snafus or what
842440	848460	but um one of the things I thought was cool was at the con there were nine of us sharing
848460	853540	a hotel room yes nine of us sharing a hotel room Misty of course if you listen to show
853540	858000	a long time you probably recognize that name as one of our OLR supporters organized this
858000	863360	whole thing amongst you know a lot of folks she knew and just what have you kind of like
863360	866680	friends of friends and there were nine of us in a room but what was cool about that
866680	873360	is one night we had Street Fighter IV going on the TV in the hotel room which was a plasma
873360	878200	HD TV it was a nice TV because this is the Hyatt it was a pretty nice hotel so we hooked
878200	883860	up two arcade sticks to the TV and just had a ball with it it was a lot of fun and congrats
883860	890360	by the way to OLR me member Rob D for winning the Street Fighter IV tournament at ASEN very
890360	895920	nice work so that was pretty much it for my gaming week I had a good time I had fun at
895920	901160	the convention and yeah thanks to everybody who came out for the panel and if you are

952160	956640	how much stuff I have I I have an idea where it is trust me as soon as I locate the turbo
956640	961520	graphics it's yours yeah otherwise I was saying a Saturn with no cords he uh well maybe we
961520	965240	can give that away in a future show I think I have a spare hookups he asked he actually
965240	968920	asked me about it but he you know I was like oh she didn't have a chance to see me he understood
968920	974080	he knew you've been busy so he he knows he'll get it pulling my brain out through my ears
974080	978440	that's all right school sucks uh and let's see uh of course I already mentioned that
978440	982720	we're at a new summer home for the show so we've for those of you stalking at home we've
982720	986440	moved from Rancho Cordova to what Citrus Heights are we in now are we technically in Citrus
986440	990080	Heights yes we have no longer in Rancho Cambodia all right so we've uh moved the show that's
990080	993880	right there'll be less gunshots here in uh Citrus Heights that'll be nice unless uh police
993880	998160	helicopters flying overhead at the end of the show uh and unfortunately though there's
998160	1002920	no justin tv tonight we're hoping to have it up again next week but it may be a little
1002920	1007600	while just because we had to move a lot over here and justin tv has a lot of cable and
1007600	1012800	wires so remember guys it's a radio show first video show and it's too bad too because I
1012800	1017720	had by net commando oh bummer but hey at least we have to play that after the show yeah all
1017720	1021960	right anyhow um let's get into some gaming news that's what we're here it's been a very
1021960	1026600	very busy week as we start to ramp up to e3 stuff is just spilling out and we have lots
1026600	1031240	of e3 rumors but first some facts and loki's gonna start us off with a cold hard facts
1031240	1039280	tonight fact duke nukem forever is still not out and um this isn't helping 3d realms the
1039280	1045580	developer of said game is actually or i should say publishing said game is no longer around
1045580	1053960	they've actually shut down and um have seats to um operate due to funding issues and apparently
1053960	1058960	um apogee software has also laid off all the staff that probably doesn't help the game
1058960	1063960	come out any sooner now when you think about it um and then on top of all that you may
1063960	1071800	not know this but um take two i was apparently financing duke nukem forever and um had invested
1071800	1079480	approximately 12 million dollars according to take two and never and according to um
1079480	1083120	scott miller at 3d realms of course they're saying that they never received any of that
1083120	1089920	money and of course the game's not done yet so now take two is actually filed a lawsuit
1089920	1098040	against um the former 3d realms members and demanding that they get their source code
1098040	1103440	kind of sounds like a whole lot of um stuff that was going on with uh you know scratching
1103440	1110080	dj hero but hopefully if they do finally turn over that source code take two the game will
1110080	1116400	actually be finished and you know take two makes some pretty awesome games so that could
1116400	1122720	be good definitely would come out a lot sooner than say 10 years or more than 10 years god
1122720	1127480	i don't even know how many years it is now well sorry to hear it 3d realms this has been
1127480	1136040	forever this salutes for you no that does suck because it is people's jobs and things
1136040	1140000	but you know this is one of those things that when it was announced i don't know about you
1140000	1143760	guys but when i heard the news i was kind of like i'm kind of surprised this didn't
1143760	1148980	happen sooner and i don't mean to sound like insensitive but in this economy when we've
1148980	1153060	seen what's been happening to studios left and right i was kind of surprised that when
1153060	1157480	i when i heard this news i was like oh yeah how did this studio that had a game that's
1157480	1162360	been in development for like 12 years survive as long as they've had you know what i mean
1162360	1167280	i'm just surprised that take two would keep throwing money at this you know seeing as
1167280	1171360	there's i mean especially since it's been like 10 years i mean come on i would think
1171360	1176600	it by now they would be like okay we're gonna pass this on to somebody else or well i guess
1176600	1182280	maybe they're just you know it's not their game so i don't know well since the word of
1182280	1187640	the night seems to be reboot doesn't it seem like they've rebooted duke nukem forever internally
1187640	1191040	several times and we've seen this game kind of develop over the years and what's weird
1191040	1195960	is that we've seen more media after the game was you know essentially essentially frozen
1195960	1200440	again here with the closing of 3d realms uh we've seen more on it now and it seems like
1200440	1203880	it seems that the game reinvented itself over the past few years doesn't it yeah a few times
1203880	1207620	that's the engines you know were being developed and so i think at one time it was running
1207620	1211520	on you know one of the quake engines and then you know they ran it on something else and
1211520	1216600	now it's on it's like something that's like unreal ish but i think it's their own engine
1216600	1222040	but yeah it's definitely not what it used to be and unfortunately it should have come
1222040	1229480	out a long time ago but i swear it's elvis well or tupac loki in your you know expert
1229480	1233560	opinion i use that term loosely what do you think do you think we're ever going to see
1233560	1237760	this game or is it now officially deader than a doornail we're never going to see it uh
1237760	1240720	no i think that we'll see this game because take two's got money and they want another
1240720	1246600	franchise that's going to do well and duke nukem i mean you think the last take two thing
1246600	1252840	that they've uh or take two game that uh published at 3d realm was a prey this is the last 3d
1252840	1258080	realm game that they published uh oh and that did not meet expectations either that wasn't
1258080	1264320	very good but at the same time i mean they actually for what it's worth i enjoyed prey
1264320	1268200	because prey was a great game for those of us that suck at first-person shooters because
1268200	1272780	of the fact that you couldn't die and actually prey was kind of epic it just felt like prey
1272780	1277520	ended very abruptly that was praise biggest detractor but everything leading up to that
1277520	1283040	point was actually pretty awesome i actually really enjoyed prey well they need to still
1283040	1286980	have a good first-person shooter franchise because they don't have one right now they
1286980	1292880	have basically your sandbox games like grand theft auto and red dead revolver those two
1292880	1298680	franchises they've got their sports games um you know all the 2k sports stuff and also
1298680	1303400	you know um if they ever do another table tennis game so you've got that but they don't
1303400	1307240	have a first-person shooter franchise they have their kids lines and stuff like that
1307240	1312120	like that um you know nickelodeon nick jr stuff but they need a good first-person shooter
1312120	1317240	thing and what better but you know than duke nukem i mean i think it'd be awesome if they
1317240	1322360	actually put out a good game and that's the problem is the expectations for are so high
1322360	1327120	and they want to set like this new precedent for interactivity in the game well that's
1327120	1333000	good but the game's got to be good also i mean and it's also got to get finished within
1333000	1338920	timely manner just like fable to fable to oh let's you know make this really amazing
1338920	1344640	ai you know the dog and all that stuff awesome that i'm glad that you did all that stuff
1344640	1351480	but the game was still mediocre so come on i don't know let's go to the chat room i've
1351480	1355360	been um totally ignoring them tonight and i really apologize chat that orange lounge
1355360	1358800	trader.com of course is always open when we're here uh we're just trying to get used to the
1358800	1362180	new setup tonight so it's taking me a little longer to get around to them however i want
1362180	1366160	to read this because it's something what i'm thinking too unfolded raptor in chat says
1366160	1370960	i heard about prey 2 and it sounded awesome and this news saddens me so come to think
1370960	1375240	of it that just kind of made me think oh yeah this means prey 2 is is definitely deader
1375240	1380000	than a doornail right because since the first one didn't do that hot well let's let's say
1380000	1384160	you know the whole deal with them investing money is that they get rights to this kind
1384160	1388600	of stuff because obviously you know it they may sell the rights to somebody else you know
1388600	1393960	because they're no longer around um you know and uh act f pointed out in chat room uh max
1393960	1397800	pain 3 is another game franchise that they have who's a third person shooter you know
1397800	1402560	if we're gonna draw straws here but it's not a first person shooter still very good action
1402560	1408440	franchise but i don't know i think that they they need something like this you know what
1408440	1411500	take two should do if they're gonna inherit all the rights to all these you know apogee
1411500	1415480	games and 3d realms they should just give us a new commander keen game how about that
1415480	1440940	if you're gonna
1440940	1443480	kind of sucked, you know.
1443480	1444360	Dr. Sacker?
1444360	1446020	Well, I was actually going to try and wanted
1446020	1449120	to make a point earlier about them, you know,
1449120	1450700	with Duke Nukem Forever.
1450700	1453100	The other thing they're going to have going for them
1453100	1457740	to their advantage is, was 10 years now of coverage press
1457740	1459700	hype?
1459700	1462140	They could slap out a game that sucks
1462140	1465020	with the Duke Nukem Forever name on it, and it'll still sell.
1465020	1466940	And do you think that's what's going to happen?
1466940	1469220	Do you think that maybe 3D Realms was holding out
1469220	1472460	for the perfect game, and now Take Two maybe,
1472460	1474900	and I'm just theorizing here, is going to rush something
1474900	1477860	out the door based on whatever they get that's just going
1477860	1479620	to have the Duke Nukem Forever name on it,
1479620	1481740	just get it out there and say, finally, it's done.
1481740	1482620	Here, slap.
1482620	1484540	Well, also you've got to look at Take Two.
1484540	1487020	I mean, what kind of idiots were running
1487020	1489900	the whole process of them getting this game done?
1489900	1493100	Because seriously, usually they have different checkpoints
1493100	1496260	that they have to make before they get funding for this stuff.
1496260	1499300	I mean, and how could this go on for 10 years?
1499300	1502740	$12 million later, how could they just let it go?
1502740	1505300	I mean, there's got to be some sort of progress being made.
1505300	1509340	And the fact that over 10 years worth of work
1509340	1510980	and nothing's out, I'm sorry.
1510980	1514900	But even Grand Theft Auto IV and all these other big blockbuster
1514900	1518740	games only took a few years to put out, if that.
1518740	1521700	So come on, what the hell?
1521700	1522900	Get a better development team.
1522900	1524860	Somebody was holding out for perfection,
1524860	1526060	and it just never arrived.
1526060	1527180	I guess.
1527180	1527660	All right.
1527660	1529900	Well, moving on, let's go into music game worlds,
1529900	1531740	because it's interesting we talk about source codes
1531740	1533500	and legal settlements and so on, because there
1533500	1535740	was some interesting development in the whole Scratch
1535740	1538940	versus Activision versus this whole thing.
1538940	1542300	And what happened is that this week an LA Superior Court
1542300	1545380	judge ordered that the source code for Scratch
1545380	1549720	the Ultimate DJ must be turned over to Genius and Newmark.
1549720	1552500	These are the two companies that formed the Scratch the Ultimate
1552500	1553620	DJ LLC.
1553620	1556140	There was actually a company, a limited liability court,
1556140	1557660	formed behind this.
1557660	1560420	Seven Studios is, of course, now owned by Activision.
1560420	1563020	They are also going to have to hand over everything
1563020	1564880	they used to make the game.
1564880	1568620	Scratch LLC says they are going to finish the game,
1568620	1571200	and they will continue their lawsuit against Activision
1571200	1571980	as well.
1571980	1575100	But the bad news, I'm reading between the lines here,
1575100	1576340	nothing's been said for sure.
1576340	1578380	But the bad news is don't expect to see this game
1578380	1581740	until at least next year now, after all this, probably,
1581740	1582500	which is too bad.
1582500	1585620	Because, I mean, at that point, then we're
1585620	1587740	going to have DJ Hero out there as well.
1587740	1591220	And is it just going to be oversaturation at that point?
1591220	1593060	Or is there room for two, like there was room
1593060	1594300	for Guitar Hero and Rock Band?
1594300	1597100	There's room for two.
1597100	1599260	The only real experience I have with DJ Hero
1599260	1602020	is what I've been reading in Game Informer.
1602020	1603700	And they do kind of show how the game's
1603700	1606380	going to play, which is quite different than how
1606380	1607300	this is going to play.
1607300	1609340	Because Scratch plays pretty much like Beatmania,
1609340	1612200	but now they have a more enhanced scratching system
1612200	1613140	and that kind of stuff.
1613140	1614740	And you can do a little bit of improv.
1614740	1619180	But when you look at the two games, clearly,
1619180	1622260	and I hate to say this, clearly, DJ Hero
1622260	1625520	is actually kind of changing the way you play the game
1625520	1629700	and more innovative in that sense.
1629700	1631300	But I don't know.
1631300	1632780	I mean, yeah, it does suck.
1632780	1635840	But at the same time, when we first saw Guitar Hero,
1635840	1638300	most of us looked at it and went, eh, it's just guitar
1638300	1639660	freaks, but a little bit different.
1639660	1641100	I mean, in Scratch the Ultimate DJ,
1641100	1642740	we kind of look at it and go, eh, it's Beatmania,
1642740	1645300	but it's hip hop instead of techno music.
1645300	1648100	So I mean, is that necessarily a bad thing?
1648100	1650680	Because those first looks can be deceiving, right?
1650680	1652980	Because Guitar Hero ended up being a pretty awesome game.
1652980	1654580	Not necessarily a bad thing.
1654580	1656340	And they might have had a chance if they
1656340	1658820	could get to market first like they were planning on.
1658820	1661500	Because if everything had gone as planned,
1661500	1664980	they would be putting this game out in a couple weeks.
1664980	1667100	But that's not what happened.
1667100	1671540	So now you've got this monster of a game coming
1671540	1675060	from Activision that's due out in October.
1675060	1679620	And this game is, unless they do some serious miracle working
1679620	1682180	and haul some ass on getting this game done,
1682180	1684260	I don't think it's going to be done before it.
1684260	1686560	That means we're probably not going to see it at E3 either.
1686560	1688540	But wouldn't it be interesting if we did?
1688540	1690180	But I'm not going to hold my breath.
1690180	1692940	They were saying that they were going to have it there,
1692940	1693580	I thought.
1693580	1695740	But I don't know.
1695740	1696860	We'll see what happens.
1696860	1697900	More to develop, I'm sure.
1697900	1699020	It seems like some of the new is coming out
1699020	1700460	on this whole thing every week.
1700460	1703420	And E3 is just going to be kind of the climax of that.
1703420	1705460	Because you know DJ Hero is going to be there.
1705460	1707900	So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.
1707900	1710380	But for now, we move on.
1710380	1714620	And moving on to Guitar Hero 5, where there
1714620	1717140	have been some details released.
1717140	1721500	It's to be out on PS2, PS3, Wii, Xbox 360.
1721500	1725140	No word about new instruments yet.
1725140	1726980	But they say that it will allow you
1726980	1731900	to use any combination of instruments, multiple drums,
1731900	1734180	multiple guitars, different microphones.
1734180	1737140	So maybe we have a quartet mode.
1737140	1738420	I don't know.
1738420	1739460	That would be weird.
1739460	1743720	So if I wanted to get four singers to sing these songs,
1743720	1744380	I could do that.
1744380	1746420	They better all freaking be on pitch,
1746420	1747820	or I will not listen to them.
1747820	1749180	Four drummers, too.
1749180	1752140	I could just have a house full of clacking drums.
1752140	1752940	That'd be hilarious.
1752940	1753440	Interesting.
1753440	1754300	Yes, you could do that.
1754300	1754940	And great.
1754940	1758780	There's also another option for party play,
1758780	1762900	meaning that you can come in and out of the songs as you will.
1762900	1766660	So it's not going to be the, ah, dropping.
1766660	1768740	It'll be the, oh, they left.
1771620	1780260	There's supposed to be the music creation studio to be reworked.
1780260	1785780	And that you can actually trigger all of your band moments
1785780	1789740	when you hit parts simultaneously.
1789740	1793700	And there are some challenges and different things.
1793700	1796940	I guess they're trying to make it interesting.
1796940	1800140	On top of that, it will be compatible with Guitar Hero
1800140	1801120	World Tour.
1801120	1807780	And you can actually upgrade the old game
1807780	1812660	to use all the new enhancements in Guitar Hero 5.
1812660	1815620	They're supposed to also have some Johnny Cash.
1815620	1817540	That's the best news of all.
1817540	1821580	INGN0 in chat asks, could you do four singers, four guitarists,
1821580	1822860	and four drummers?
1822860	1824260	I don't think all at once.
1824260	1827020	Any combination of five, I think.
1827020	1827700	Four, maybe.
1827700	1828460	Well, maybe five.
1828460	1828980	I don't know.
1828980	1829500	I'm sorry, four.
1829500	1829900	That's right.
1829900	1831660	Yeah, because there's only four control slots.
1831660	1832380	I was looking at five.
1832380	1833820	I think it's a combination of four.
1833820	1836660	But who knows what's going to be able to be done on the internet?
1836660	1838820	That'd be kind of neat to have band versus band
1838820	1840780	at the same time.
1840780	1841540	Be interesting.
1841540	1843060	That's a lot of people, though.
1843060	1847020	Well, have you, well, someone did that without a game.
1847020	1848540	The YouTube band.
1848540	1849500	I haven't heard of this.
1849500	1851500	It's a page that has different embedded YouTube
1851500	1855820	videos of people playing chords and different passages
1855820	1856940	in the same key.
1856940	1857660	Oh, weird.
1857660	1859660	And you can actually play them all at once
1859660	1860740	or at different times.
1860740	1863380	And they're all harmonious.
1863380	1864100	It's really cool.
1864100	1865460	I'll try to find the link again.
1865460	1866060	Gotcha.
1866060	1866700	OK.
1866700	1869900	But in theory, you could have it.
1869900	1870420	OK.
1870420	1871260	Could be interesting.
1871260	1872180	Could be interesting.
1872180	1874540	I'm curious to see how this plays out.
1874540	1876300	But I bet you, this is just going to, you know,
1876300	1877700	all the YouTubes you see out there,
1877700	1880540	speaking of which of people playing Guitar Hero and stuff,
1880540	1882820	this is just going to up the craziness of those videos.
1882820	1884100	Because now I can just see it.
1884100	1886700	We're going to have the four people all singing,
1886700	1888580	you know, crazy, Journey or whatever.
1888580	1890620	Then we're going to have just people doing all the mad
1890620	1891900	drumming, four people at once.
1891900	1894580	You know you're going to see that expert, everybody in sync,
1894580	1895900	four people playing video.
1895900	1897340	It's going to be interesting.
1897340	1899220	I don't know.
1899220	1900900	But I don't know if it'll be fun.
1900900	1902660	That's the real question.
1902660	1903340	So we'll see.
1903340	1903900	We'll see.
1903900	1906500	I'm sure this will also be at E3.
1906500	1908580	We'll know more about it then.
1908580	1913740	Well, to make things even more complicated in the DJ game
1913740	1918620	genre, apparently there's another DJ game coming out.
1918620	1922220	Armin van Buuren is actually releasing a brand new game
1922220	1926900	on the Wii called Armin van Buuren in the mix.
1926900	1929140	And it's due out this fall.
1929140	1931380	Apparently the developer at Cloud9
1931380	1934820	is developing the game with him and allow
1934820	1937660	players to remix his music.
1937660	1938260	I don't know.
1938260	1939420	That sounds kind of cheap.
1939420	1941460	Well, now see, usually I would write this off.
1941460	1943580	I'd go, eh, it's going to be on the Wii.
1943580	1945980	It's probably just going to be another one of those cheesy
1945980	1947220	party games or whatever.
1947220	1950500	But dude, Armin van Buuren's actually pretty awesome.
1950500	1954100	So with his name behind it, and granted,
1954100	1956060	just because you have a big name behind it doesn't
1956060	1957440	mean the game's going to be good.
1957440	1959940	But if it's his music and stuff, it
1959940	1963900	has the potential to be pretty decent.
1963900	1967260	I mean, it's hard to say with no screenshots and no peripherals.
1967260	1969740	But the potential's there.
1969740	1972780	It's just if history has taught us anything,
1972780	1977380	I think a lot of us have very low expectations,
1977380	1978900	if you know what I mean.
1978900	1980020	So we'll see.
1980020	1980940	We'll see.
1980940	1983140	Yeah, and a very good point in the chat room.
1983140	1986140	Tiger Kala says, this is good for trance music.
1986140	1988380	And that's a good point, too, is that with Scratch,
1988380	1990060	we're looking at hip hop music.
1990060	1992700	With DJ Hero, we're looking at mashups.
1992700	1995020	Maybe this is going to be the game
1995020	1997200	that the Beatmania fans are drawn towards,
1997200	1999700	because it's more of the trancey music they're
1999700	2001340	used to from Beatmania.
2001340	2001860	Maybe.
2001860	2004560	With a very big question mark there.
2004560	2005140	Who knows?
2005140	2006520	A lot could happen with this game.
2006520	2009100	But if you think about it, for those folks that
2009100	2011700	are trying to find a new home, since Konami is not really
2011700	2014420	doing anything with 2DX in the States,
2014420	2016500	maybe this Armin Van Buren game is going
2016500	2017700	to actually be kind of cool.
2017700	2020700	Do you think we're going to see something like Rock Revolution
2020700	2024020	but coming out from the Beatmania type of thing?
2024020	2028100	I am actually tempted to say no, because of how horrifically
2028100	2030100	Rock Revolution did.
2030100	2031060	But it depends.
2031060	2033500	If they put some new creative energy behind it,
2033500	2035060	it's just they're so retarded now.
2035060	2036180	It's like, what happened?
2036180	2037860	I mean, I know what happened.
2037860	2040860	You got rid of all the people that actually had some ideas
2040860	2043980	of where to take the whole Bomani genre.
2043980	2045540	Instead, you got rid of all of them,
2045540	2048620	and now you're coming out, potentially,
2048620	2053700	with a collection of older songs, like another Best Hits.
2053700	2054300	Yeah.
2054300	2055660	Oh, that takes some thought.
2055660	2056960	Oh, let's take some old songs.
2056960	2058580	We don't even have to do shit.
2058580	2060540	Let's just put it into a new game.
2060540	2061700	Done.
2061700	2064420	I'm going to go vacation for the rest of the year.
2064420	2065420	I don't know.
2065420	2067980	It is disappointing how the mighty
2067980	2071460	have fallen in terms of creativity and innovation.
2071460	2074460	But stranger things have happened.
2074460	2076020	Let's push some more Frogger games.
2076020	2077580	That'd be perfect.
2077580	2081660	Because Frogger, that's a franchise that'll never die.
2081660	2082700	That's gold right there.
2082700	2085460	Well, speaking of competition, a lot of talk
2085460	2087500	has come up this week about the different turntables
2087500	2089820	between the Scratch game and DJ Hero.
2089820	2091660	And what's interesting is that if you actually
2091660	2094860	look at the Scratch turntable, the Scratch turntable
2094860	2096700	looks somewhat like a BeatMania controller.
2096700	2098500	Of course, I hope your left side pried,
2098500	2100020	because that's the direction it looks like it goes.
2100020	2100460	Ah, that does flip.
2100460	2101100	Although, does it do it?
2101100	2101900	It does flip.
2101900	2102660	Oh, that's good.
2102660	2104820	But it has five keys on it.
2104820	2107380	But they're not staggered like you would see on a BeatMania
2107380	2107900	controller.
2107900	2108820	They're all in a row.
2108820	2110500	Kind of looks very much like it looks
2110500	2112700	like someone ripped off a Guitar Hero controller
2112700	2114500	and just kind of laid it next to a turntable.
2114500	2116300	That's what the Scratch turntable looks like.
2116300	2119540	So don't expect it to look the piano look of BeatMania,
2119540	2120380	if that makes sense.
2120380	2121320	It's all in a row.
2121320	2122820	And otherwise, it looks like there's
2122820	2126500	a little kind of crossfader, a little switch at the very, very
2126500	2128420	end as well that's going to be used in the game.
2128420	2129340	Kind of a bonus thing.
2129340	2131540	Yeah, basically, the Scratch turntable,
2131540	2135060	it's got a really nice made turntable.
2135060	2137300	It's being developed by Newmark.
2137300	2140300	The platter itself is actually the same type
2140300	2144820	of platter you'd find on an MP3 turntable.
2144820	2146400	And that's where people got confused.
2146400	2148540	They're all, oh, it's a real MP3 turntable.
2148540	2150780	I can use this as an actual turntable.
2150780	2153360	No, you can't use it as an actual turntable
2153360	2154300	for your MP3s.
2154300	2157380	But it's the same hardware going into it.
2157380	2160140	And then, of course, the buttons, as you said,
2160140	2161860	they're all color coded and everything.
2161860	2164940	Actually, I think that one is the 360 one,
2164940	2167220	based off of the little x in the corner.
2167220	2168220	So it has to be the 360.
2168220	2171060	And so it's color coded to the 360.
2171060	2174500	And the actual crossfader on the side
2174500	2177300	is basically for the scratching, for different Scratch
2177300	2178180	techniques.
2178180	2181420	So the game plays very similar beat mania type of game.
2181420	2183540	But the scratching itself, you can do all the Scratch
2183540	2185900	techniques and all the cutouts and stuff
2185900	2188940	like that with the crossfader.
2188940	2190860	That's what that's there for.
2190860	2193580	Now, earlier this week also, they
2193580	2196660	had a partial picture of the game.
2196660	2198580	Can I say that before you move on to DJ Hero?
2198580	2200120	I just want to remind folks, we talked
2200120	2202120	about the song list of this game a long time ago.
2202120	2204980	And Loki had a cutting edge first look at the game
2204980	2206100	before a lot of people did.
2206100	2209140	I just want to remind everybody, Milkshake by Kelis
2209140	2210140	is in this game.
2210140	2212480	It needs to come out.
2212480	2212980	That's all.
2212980	2213540	Potentially in this game.
2213540	2214020	That is all.
2214020	2214780	That can all change.
2214780	2215060	Who knows?
2215060	2216420	Hopefully they don't lose the licensing
2216420	2217460	with everything going on.
2217460	2220820	But come on, your Milkshake will bring all the boys to the yard
2220820	2221980	if this game comes out.
2221980	2225200	Now, the DJ Hero controller did put out
2225200	2229500	some pictures of what looks like the turntable platter
2229500	2232220	with three color buttons on it.
2232220	2235260	Now, the picture that went out on the internet
2235260	2239220	is obviously only half of what actually the controller is.
2239220	2243740	If you had gotten your latest copy of Game Informer magazine,
2243740	2245980	they actually did a six page write up on it.
2245980	2248180	And they actually have a picture of the full turntable
2248180	2249020	controller in here.
2249020	2252040	Of course, you've got the turntable as well with the three
2252040	2253660	buttons on there.
2253660	2258020	You've also got attached to it is a cross fader as well.
2258020	2259860	And there's also an effector dial and then
2259860	2261980	a button that's called the euphoria button,
2261980	2266420	or basically the overdrive or whatever that you
2266420	2267780	would have in Guitar Hero.
2267780	2271820	Now, the way the game's played, similar to Guitar Hero,
2271820	2274580	you're going to have your icons coming down the screen.
2274580	2277180	And you've got to hit them with those three buttons.
2277180	2280980	However, each of those buttons also represents other things.
2280980	2283360	The green button, which is the farthest on the left,
2283360	2284600	is going to be the first track.
2284600	2286060	So anything that you see over there
2286060	2289100	is going to basically be beats or whatever
2289100	2291700	that are part of the first track that you're mixing in.
2291700	2294380	The center is going to be the red, which
2294380	2298980	is also for effects and stuff that appear on both tracks.
2298980	2301940	It's also the cue up, I guess, your different effects
2301940	2303180	that you can throw in there.
2303180	2305620	And then finally, the blue, which is on the right,
2305620	2308020	is everything that's on the second song.
2308020	2311500	Also, the three tracks themselves
2311500	2316320	have other variations that are going to be coming down.
2316320	2319180	For example, the green on the far left,
2319180	2323700	you'll see that the line that follows the track basically
2323700	2326060	is going to shift back left and right.
2326060	2328560	And that's where you're going to be doing the cross-fading.
2328560	2332420	That's your cue to move the cross-fader, kind of like
2332420	2336780	if you've ever played it, Scratch or was it Crackin' DJ,
2336780	2339260	very similar to that.
2339260	2342580	And then also, they've got in the center
2342580	2344500	is going to cue when you or give you
2344500	2347000	the cue when you can do the different sound effects
2347000	2349100	and change your actual effector dial.
2349100	2351900	And then finally, the far right, the blue,
2351900	2354780	is going to also have your cues for scratching.
2354780	2356460	And I think that might also be able to go
2356460	2360020	on the different tracks altogether.
2360020	2362380	I'm not sure if it's just limited to those.
2362380	2364340	But basically, you have to hold down those keys
2364340	2366980	while you're doing the scratching, cross-fading stuff.
2366980	2370080	So it's a different style of gameplay
2370080	2372940	than, say, a Guitar Hero game or Beat Mania.
2372940	2374940	But it's going to have that kind of same effect.
2374940	2377500	And then also, all the tracks in the game
2377500	2381220	are all basically mash-ups, some of the examples
2381220	2382420	they had in here.
2382420	2385140	Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc. versus Marvin Gaye,
2385140	2386460	I heard it through the grapevine.
2386460	2388540	What?
2388540	2390220	Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers,
2390220	2393020	Bustin' Loose versus The Zombies, Time of the Season,
2393020	2396220	DJ Shadowmix, because DJ Shadow did a lot of stuff
2396220	2397140	in the game.
2397140	2400460	David Bowie, Let's Dance versus KRS-One, Jack of Spades,
2400460	2402380	DJ Shadowmix.
2402380	2407020	Nirvana, All Apologies versus Rick James, Give it to Me Baby,
2407020	2408260	the DJ Shadowmix.
2408260	2409220	What the hell?
2409220	2411020	This sounds crazy.
2411020	2414580	Tears for Fears, Shout versus Air Prayids,
2414580	2416500	Pean Joe or Peano.
2416500	2417140	Wow.
2417140	2417900	No, I know what you're talking about.
2417900	2419060	Yeah, this is a new single.
2419060	2419940	Yeah.
2419940	2421420	And then other artists, they've got
2421420	2423940	BC Boys Back, Blondie, and Billy Squier
2423940	2426260	are some other confirmed artists in there as well.
2426260	2429060	But yeah, the game itself, and actually, I take that back.
2429060	2432060	It looks like the scratching cues are on all three tracks.
2432060	2434100	But basically, you're going to have two sets of cues
2434100	2436060	that you're looking for, button presses and then
2436060	2438580	actions with the crossfader and stuff.
2438580	2440940	Just seeing how they're going to do this,
2440940	2442940	I'm actually more excited now about DJ Hero
2442940	2443780	than I was Scratch.
2443780	2446820	Because Scratch is basically kind of a fancy beat mania,
2446820	2448700	but this looks a lot different.
2448700	2450820	And it's going to be interesting to see what
2450820	2452100	you're going to be able to do.
2452100	2453820	Also, they've got two player mode in this
2453820	2456060	where you can do the guitars in some of the songs.
2456060	2458560	And you're also going to be able to hook up a microphone to it
2458560	2460620	if you want to MC over everything.
2460620	2461460	Wow.
2461460	2462900	That sounds interesting.
2462900	2464540	Yeah, so very cool stuff.
2464540	2466340	They got the right idea with this stuff.
2466340	2467860	Let's see if we can get this on mic.
2467860	2468580	Very interesting.
2468580	2470980	Are you trying to get Shermie to meow on mic for us?
2470980	2471740	Oh, her purr?
2471740	2473460	I don't know what the purr will pick up.
2473460	2475220	That mic's probably not sensitive enough.
2475220	2476780	No, it's not coming through.
2476780	2478460	No.
2478460	2479580	It's not registering.
2479580	2481160	But we're trying to get a Shermie cameo.
2481160	2482380	Definitely, definitely.
2482380	2488780	I'd say, if anything, go to your bookstore, Barnes & Noble
2488780	2489740	or whatever.
2489740	2492140	Just pick up a copy of the new Game of War magazine
2492140	2493300	or just browse through it.
2493300	2495140	And at least check out the section
2495140	2497160	that they have on DJ Hero.
2497160	2498700	It's actually very interesting seeing
2498700	2500860	as they haven't shown anything really yet for it.
2500860	2503260	I'm sure we're going to see a lot more out of E3.
2503260	2505780	And I think it's going to be really fun to check out.
2505780	2507740	And yeah, it is another thing you've got to buy,
2507740	2508580	another instrument.
2508580	2511300	But looking at this, though, I don't
2511300	2513580	see how they're really going to add anything
2513580	2515500	to this beyond just the turntable.
2515500	2518760	And really, you can't play this game two player
2518760	2520780	with two turntables yet.
2520780	2522100	Maybe that's for the next game.
2522100	2523100	Maybe for the next game.
2523100	2525020	But right now, it's just one turntable, so.
2525020	2526740	By the way, the chat is saying I'm on crack
2526740	2528000	and that they could hear the purr.
2528000	2528580	So there you go.
2528580	2530120	Sure need to make a cameo on the show.
2530120	2530620	Yay.
2530620	2532580	Although no lights came on on the mixing board,
2532580	2533580	unless I'm looking at it.
2533580	2534460	Yeah, I saw the move.
2534460	2536720	Oh, maybe I just, maybe that knob is in the way.
2536720	2537800	I can't see it very well.
2537800	2538300	Anyway.
2538300	2539100	You said knob.
2539100	2540940	Yeah, I said knob.
2540940	2542780	Jamie, your knob's in the way.
2542780	2544540	Anyway, let's move on.
2544540	2546500	This DJ Hero game sounds pretty cool.
2546500	2547920	Definitely probably one of the first things
2547920	2548860	we're going to check out of E3.
2548860	2549340	I know that.
2549340	2551220	One of the things, yeah, definitely.
2551220	2552940	OK, let's move on to some release dates.
2552940	2553820	Talk about some of the things that are
2553820	2555020	going to be coming out soon.
2555020	2557900	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with a trip to the UK?
2557900	2559700	Well, we have a few things.
2559700	2561900	On the 19th, Warrior Epic for PC,
2561900	2564180	and then a bunch of stuff for the 22nd.
2564180	2568100	Big Family Games on Wii, Terminator Salvation for PC,
2568100	2572340	UFC 2009 Undisputed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,
2572340	2576340	Bionic Commando for the same two, Pokemon Platinum for DS,
2576340	2577740	and Steel Princess.
2577740	2580500	Is this a typo?
2580500	2581980	I found a typo.
2581980	2582820	Why?
2582820	2585660	Is Steel Princess supposed to be as in the act of theft
2585660	2587020	or as in metal?
2587020	2588100	As in the act of theft.
2588100	2590940	OK, never mind, then it's not a typo.
2590940	2594620	Yeah, it's supposed to be funny, like that.
2594620	2595700	OK.
2595700	2597940	So you just, is that like kidnapping the princess,
2597940	2598900	or what happens there?
2598900	2601380	No, I think it's the princess is a thief.
2601380	2603700	Oh, OK, sort of like Zelda?
2603700	2604620	I'm going to find out.
2604620	2605780	Maybe.
2605780	2606340	That was chic.
2606340	2606820	Like chic?
2606820	2608380	Well, you know what I mean, same thing.
2608380	2608980	Same thing.
2608980	2610300	Oops, spoiler.
2610300	2610900	Oops.
2610900	2612580	Oh, no, I did not know that.
2612580	2615060	Oh, no, because I've never played Smash Bros. Brawl.
2615060	2618500	Interesting looking puzzle platformer.
2618500	2619140	Huh, all right.
2619140	2621260	And you can have a map maker.
2621260	2622220	It looks cute.
2622220	2623460	All right, let's move on.
2623460	2625500	Traveling the world, how about the US?
2625500	2627620	US, we've got actually quite a bit of stuff
2627620	2629500	coming out this week.
2629500	2632180	On PC, Hinterland Orc Lords.
2632180	2636780	Never heard of that, but could be good, maybe.
2636780	2638980	Puzzle Kingdoms on the Wii, that's
2638980	2641420	a rip off of Puzzle Quest, but it's
2641420	2644820	done by the same developer, so they're ripping off themselves.
2644820	2646340	So they're ripping off themselves.
2646340	2647300	Well, that's OK, right?
2647300	2648340	Yeah, that's all right.
2648340	2653060	Bionite Commando on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
2653060	2654300	No word on PC.
2654300	2656500	I can't remember if that's coming out at the same time.
2656500	2660460	Punch-Out this week, big game on the Wii, that'll be fun.
2660460	2663220	If you're into some movie games, Terminator Salvation.
2663220	2664820	Is it?
2664820	2665420	I don't know.
2665420	2667060	I'm a little skeptical about Punch-Out.
2667060	2667540	I'm sorry.
2667540	2670140	I'm derailing the train, but Loki, is it?
2670140	2671620	Do you really think it's going to be great,
2671620	2673580	or do you think it's going to be a little cheesy?
2673580	2676660	I think it's going to be about as good as the first Punch-Out.
2676660	2678020	I love the first Punch-Out.
2678020	2678540	Exactly.
2678540	2682300	And basically, they brought all the graphics up to date,
2682300	2684820	and they gave you the first Punch-Out again
2684820	2686660	with some other bells and whistles.
2686660	2687940	That's all right.
2687940	2688440	We'll see.
2688440	2688940	We'll see.
2688940	2690260	I'm a little skeptical.
2690260	2693220	I want to demo it before I buy it, that's for sure.
2693220	2697540	Terminator Salvation coming out on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC,
2697540	2701420	also done by the same developers as Buy It Commando.
2701420	2704020	Boom Blocks, Bash Party coming out on the Wii,
2704020	2707700	kind of a reissue there with extra puzzles.
2707700	2709780	Tournament Pool coming out on the Wii,
2709780	2712620	your generic billiards game.
2712620	2713180	Yu-Gi-Oh!
2713180	2715980	Stardust Accelerator World Championship 2009.
2715980	2717700	Here's what Konami's working on.
2717700	2718580	More Yu-Gi-Oh!
2718580	2720060	games.
2720060	2721540	EA Sports Active.
2721540	2723500	Hey, they sell.
2723500	2726260	Brand new fitness game from EA, hoping
2726260	2728580	to capitalize on the whole wheat fit craze.
2728580	2731600	Although, this does have an elastic resistance band
2731600	2734340	with it, so you can actually do some pretty good exercises
2734340	2735060	with it.
2735060	2739420	Thinking about getting it, but probably won't use it.
2739420	2741740	Jagged Alliance for the DS.
2741740	2744300	And talking about an old game ported over.
2744300	2747460	Rock Band, classic rock track pack coming out
2747460	2749500	on all four systems.
2749500	2757100	UFC 2009 Undisputed coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360.
2757100	2760140	Space Camp coming out on DS and on the Wii.
2760140	2760900	Like the 80s movie?
2760900	2762740	No, not based off the 80s movie.
2762740	2764940	Damn it, why can't it be?
2764940	2766740	I know, that would be an awesome game.
2766740	2770940	It's just another party game from Activision, sorry.
2770940	2772940	You can pretend, I guess.
2772940	2776100	Poochie Poochie Virus coming out on Nintendo DS.
2776100	2777980	Is that a sexually transmitted disease?
2777980	2778780	I don't know.
2778780	2780060	Yeah.
2780060	2781140	Yu-Gi-Oh!
2781140	2782260	Don't sleep with her.
2782260	2783780	She's got Poochie Poochie Virus.
2783780	2785020	Yeah.
2785020	2785900	Yu-Gi-Oh!
2785900	2788740	It's an STD transmitted by Charo.
2788740	2790940	Yeah, that's what Charo got on the love boat, Poochie Poochie
2790940	2793460	Virus.
2793460	2796620	Then we've got Yu-Gi-Oh's 50s Wheelie Breaker.
2796620	2799620	Yes, see, this and the last game were actually
2799620	2801660	part of the new Yu-Gi-Oh series.
2801660	2805020	It's kind of extreme, so they car battle on motorcycles
2805020	2805900	while racing.
2805900	2810300	Extreme Yu-Gi-Oh if you're extremely nerdy.
2810300	2811020	I don't know.
2811020	2813340	I can't follow the Yu-Gi-Oh stuff.
2813340	2816180	Never gotten into the card games.
2816180	2818540	Party Pigs Farmyard Games.
2818540	2821580	Yes, it's a barnyard themed sports game
2821580	2824300	from Destineer who puts out all sorts of crap.
2824300	2826020	And it will give you swine flu.
2826020	2828500	It probably will.
2828500	2829540	This is awesome.
2829540	2831140	The DS, I Love Beauty.
2831140	2833220	How about a game called Excuse My Beauty?
2833220	2834580	That's the game I want to say.
2834580	2835900	Excuse My Beauty.
2835900	2838220	Excuse My Beauty, officer.
2838220	2839860	I'll go over to Arizona, I swear.
2839860	2841420	If you haven't seen that YouTube,
2841420	2843100	after you're done listening to the show tonight,
2843100	2843980	please go to YouTube.
2843980	2845900	Do yourself a favor and look up Excuse My Beauty.
2845900	2847980	It's the funniest cops you'll ever see.
2847980	2852700	And coming along with that, Imagine Makeup Artists.
2852700	2853740	Awesome.
2853740	2857260	And that's, of course, on the DS.
2857260	2858540	Because, of course, you need to be
2858540	2862540	beauty to be excused.
2862540	2865340	Exactly.
2865340	2868300	And then we've got some other cool stuff.
2868300	2870580	The Munchables, which is coming out on the Wii.
2870580	2872060	This is the game that's from Namco
2872060	2875020	that's sort of like Katamari, because there's
2875020	2876700	a lot of games sort of like Katamari.
2876700	2879860	But you basically are an alien that's
2879860	2882220	eating these food themed alien invaders.
2882220	2884780	And as you eat more of them, you get bigger
2884780	2888700	and you can eat bigger creatures and so on and so forth.
2888700	2889620	This is kind of neat.
2889620	2892980	And let's see here.
2892980	2896740	Finally, oh, actually, that's it.
2896740	2897260	Great.
2897260	2899700	Let's move on to Japan now and talk about the Japanese release
2899700	2902540	dates, where I mispronounce the release names horribly.
2902540	2903540	Yay.
2903540	2905180	Actually, this one will be easy, though.
2905180	2906740	Mass Effect, I can pronounce that.
2906740	2909940	That comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.
2909940	2911360	That would be the localized version
2911360	2913020	of Mass Effect, which, of course, came out here
2913020	2914180	quite a while ago.
2914180	2916000	But they've taken some time to make
2916000	2917220	it special for the Japanese.
2917220	2919700	And that will finally be making its way out this week.
2919700	2923160	If you're a PlayStation 3 owner, not a lot for you,
2923160	2926020	except UFC 2009, undisputed, will make its way
2926020	2929140	to Asian regions, at least, as does Bionic Commando,
2929140	2931380	but not technically a Japanese release.
2931380	2933980	You don't get anything on the PlayStation 3 in Japan
2933980	2935900	locally until next week.
2935900	2939180	But on the Nintendo Wii, you have Tact of Magic
2939180	2941180	is a game you have to look forward to.
2941180	2943460	It is coming out from Nintendo themselves,
2943460	2944940	is the game.
2944940	2948300	It is looking to be some type of RPG.
2948300	2950980	I'm not sure if it's something else.
2950980	2953260	It doesn't look like it's based off an anime or anything.
2953260	2956140	I'm not sure if that's something else here.
2956140	2957260	Not familiar to you, Loki?
2957260	2958660	The artwork does not look familiar.
2958660	2960620	I don't know if it's a new IP or what.
2960620	2964340	But that is coming out on the Wii from Nintendo, Tact of Magic.
2964340	2967140	But it may not be an anime right now.
2967140	2969540	Doesn't mean they won't become an anime later on.
2969540	2971960	Somebody in the chat room may be able to enhance on that.
2971960	2973300	Nothing on the PlayStation 2.
2973300	2973940	Either.
2973940	2976700	However, the Nintendo DS does see a few releases this week,
2976700	2979980	including Happy Star Band comes out this week,
2979980	2982100	as well as some new cases and things for the DS
2982100	2983420	if that's something you're into.
2983420	2988820	Another simple DS game this time, series number 48.
2988820	2990300	Wow.
2990300	2992220	And then, let's see.
2992220	2997100	Also, Ora ga Ome o Mamoru comes out this week
2997100	3000300	from Idea Factory, which is an action game.
3000300	3001860	Something like Protecting Something?
3001860	3004260	I Will Protect You is the English translation
3004260	3005700	of that game.
3005700	3007860	Comes out this week.
3007860	3010180	Lastly, looking at the PSP, it looks
3010180	3011260	to be kind of a slow week.
3011260	3014940	I don't know if we're getting anything on the PSP this week.
3014940	3018180	Well, you do get SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.
3018180	3020320	And Space Invaders Extreme gets a price cut.
3020320	3021820	So that's some good news on the PSP.
3021820	3025740	I bet some folks might even import that SNK Classic 1 that
3025740	3030660	has King of Fighters 94, King of Monsters, Metal Slug,
3030660	3031180	Last Resort.
3031180	3033540	I would hope not, since it's already come out.
3033540	3035620	So there you go.
3035620	3036860	Well, there might be at least.
3036860	3038140	We have a couple listeners in Japan.
3038140	3040220	Maybe they're going to pick that up for their local version.
3040220	3041020	We'll see.
3041020	3041660	There you go.
3041660	3042660	That's what's coming out in Japan.
3042660	3043940	Let's get back into some gaming news
3043940	3045140	before we get to the end of part A
3045140	3046600	with the classic game of the week.
3046600	3048300	But first, some news.
3048300	3050400	Dark Sakura has some exciting news, right?
3050400	3054060	Well, there is an issue of Nintendo Power
3054060	3059340	Out that's saying that a particular game that a lot
3059340	3061860	of people have been importing is going to be coming out
3061860	3065820	in the US, and that is Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
3065820	3072380	The issue is saying that it is definitely headed out
3072380	3075260	that Capcom has been attempting to bring it out
3075260	3076820	to North America.
3076820	3078860	But I'm still sort of, I mean, then again,
3078860	3081140	it's Nintendo's official magazine.
3081140	3081940	Wait, wait, wait.
3081940	3083460	Nintendo Power, what's that?
3083460	3085540	I've never heard of Nintendo Power.
3085540	3086700	That sounds fake.
3086700	3089040	Well, maybe people are thinking it's a Photoshop picture.
3089040	3090700	But I mean, this is going to be proven or disproven
3090700	3093660	in a couple days when the issue actually comes out, right?
3093660	3096220	Yeah, I mean, we'll find out for sure.
3096220	3098620	In fact, it says it's page 46.
3098620	3102260	So look and see if it's page 46.
3102260	3105300	I'm looking this over, by the way,
3105300	3108660	just with a very critical eye.
3108660	3113500	And let me see if I can't make this a little bit larger.
3113500	3115500	Well, I mean, what was preventing
3115500	3117500	the game from coming out here in the first place?
3117500	3118180	Licensing, right?
3118180	3119660	Because the licensing in the America
3119660	3121060	lies with all these different companies.
3121060	3122580	But if they see the demands there,
3122580	3123920	they're going to let it come out.
3123920	3126660	Do you think, though, maybe some characters might get cut?
3126660	3128780	Maybe that's the sacrifice that'll be made.
3128780	3130260	That would be unfortunate.
3130260	3131660	Let's hope not.
3131660	3132900	I don't know.
3132900	3135140	From looking at this, it doesn't really
3135140	3138780	look very Photoshopped to me because of the way
3138780	3140340	that the glare.
3140340	3145340	The glare on this is far too uniform to be.
3145340	3148540	It's either expertly Photoshopped or it's real.
3148540	3149940	I think it's the real deal, but we
3149940	3152940	need to be prepared for the fact that some of these characters
3152940	3153980	might be cut.
3153980	3155860	But that could be good news for some people
3155860	3156700	because that means they might get
3156700	3158500	replaced with additional Capcom characters.
3158500	3159220	Who knows?
3159220	3161720	I mean, I think we should be prepared to see the character
3161720	3163660	roster possibly shift slightly.
3163660	3165860	But we'll see, right?
3165860	3166500	That we will.
3166500	3170500	But I'm honestly putting my money on this being legit.
3170500	3171020	Good.
3171020	3172740	And now I have to import it.
3172740	3173580	Hooray.
3173580	3175340	It's too bad this isn't coming out instead.
3175340	3176980	What's that?
3176980	3180140	Someone's photoshopped Kellogg's versus Capcom.
3180140	3181140	The new age of breakfast.
3181140	3181940	I've seen that.
3181940	3183700	Now that would be a game I'd like to play.
3183700	3184380	That would be a lot of fun.
3184380	3185180	I would play that.
3185180	3185980	That was all right.
3185980	3188020	Tony the Tiger would throw down.
3188020	3190740	Snap, Crackle, Pop would do like a team attack.
3190740	3193140	Anyway, moving on.
3193140	3194920	Moving on.
3194920	3196500	Some other interesting things.
3196500	3197300	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
3197300	3198140	Can I say that real quick?
3198140	3198300	Yeah.
3198300	3200020	But you said this before the show tonight, Loki.
3200020	3201900	We were actually talking about this Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
3201900	3203700	You said maybe this is something Nintendo
3203700	3206580	was trying to keep under wraps until E3 to go, see,
3206580	3209380	core gamers, we heart you.
3209380	3211260	I'm sure it was.
3211260	3215220	But as all things with E3, they never stay under wraps.
3215220	3217700	Because if you tell somebody, they'll
3217700	3220420	tell somebody untrustworthy.
3220420	3222060	Like us.
3222060	3223260	Yes.
3223260	3225540	Hey, except we're trustworthy sometimes.
3225540	3226660	When we want to be, yeah.
3226660	3228180	When we want to be.
3228180	3231780	Anyways, Pokemon Gold and Silver are being remade.
3231780	3234860	And that's not a huge surprise.
3234860	3236860	But yeah.
3236860	3240380	No time frame, I guess, other than the fact
3240380	3242660	that it's supposed to be in Japan this fall
3242660	3245580	and probably coming out here sometime in the spring.
3245580	3249380	If I remember correctly, the last two games we had it,
3249380	3254340	like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Time,
3254340	3255780	and I forget the other one was.
3255780	3261660	Anyways, those were both around April, so that'd be spring.
3261660	3264300	I don't know.
3264300	3266260	Pokemon's just not my thing.
3266260	3267380	It's just really not.
3267380	3270100	I think I'm out of the age bracket for that.
3270100	3272580	I'm kind of over it, but I'm a little disappointed
3272580	3274820	it's yet another remake.
3274820	3275460	I don't know.
3275460	3277620	I would kind of like to see one of these games on the Wii.
3277620	3278580	Have you run out of ideas?
3278580	3279100	I mean.
3279100	3281180	I would like to see one of these games on the Wii.
3281180	3283460	And I understand Pokemon was born as a handheld
3283460	3285700	or what have you, but I don't know.
3285700	3287980	Or just give us a Pokemon MMO already.
3287980	3290940	I mean, Pokemon was born to be an MMO.
3290940	3292180	Couldn't it?
3292180	3293540	Maybe I'm crazy.
3293540	3295500	I don't know.
3295500	3299700	Anyhow, moving on, another game that I guess some were born
3299700	3302500	to play on the Nintendo Wii, Contra.
3302500	3305220	It's a brand new version of Contra called Contra Rebirth.
3305220	3307300	And if you're in Japan, this game already came out.
3307300	3308700	It came out on May 12.
3308700	3311500	It was released in Japan for $10.
3311500	3313860	It's awesome.
3313860	3315700	Have you heard?
3315700	3316580	I haven't heard.
3316580	3318080	Tell us a little bit what the game's like.
3318080	3318780	No, it's awesome.
3318780	3323700	It's very 16-bit Contra-ish, but they've
3323700	3325660	got a bunch of crazy ass levels in there.
3325660	3328340	Like there's one where you're skydiving
3328340	3331180	on parts of a broken spaceship and stuff
3331180	3334500	like that, fighting monsters, and all the typical stuff
3334500	3337100	that you would see in a Super Nintendo Contra game.
3337100	3339660	But awesome.
3339660	3342580	Well, the game does have co-op, just like the original Contra,
3342580	3344860	but no word yet on when it's going to come out over here
3344860	3346060	on this side of the ocean.
3346060	3348700	But I would imagine it's going to come out soon.
3348700	3351140	Probably just a little bit of localizing time.
3351140	3355020	Going to chat for some comments, Tora is in chat tonight
3355020	3357280	and is commenting on the Pokemon story, saying,
3357280	3360980	Rob, the creators already said Pokemon will never be an MMO.
3360980	3362260	Well, you know what?
3362260	3363860	Never say never.
3363860	3365420	Yeah, pass enough money their way,
3365420	3366820	and they'll be like, whatever.
3366820	3367420	Exactly.
3367420	3369300	Just like, didn't everybody say just a few weeks ago,
3369300	3372580	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom would never come out in the US, right?
3372580	3375100	Never say never.
3375100	3376500	But I mean, I get the point.
3376500	3378420	But you know, where there's money.
3378420	3382420	Didn't they also say there'd never be another Katamari game?
3382420	3384460	Yeah, we saw how long that lasted.
3384460	3385500	So we'll see.
3385500	3387300	Technically, it's not new.
3387300	3387940	I get it.
3387940	3389700	It's a snowball's chance in hell.
3389700	3391200	But there's a chance.
3391200	3392980	There's a chance.
3392980	3395100	Just a few more stories for you guys
3395100	3397020	before we get to a little break here tonight.
3397020	3398100	But first, our Sakura.
3398100	3399100	Do we get to break things?
3399100	3400140	Actually, no, not in my house.
3400140	3401380	Actually, we're at your house.
3401380	3402460	So yeah, tonight we can.
3402460	3404060	Let's start with the Dalek up there.
3404060	3409940	No.
3409940	3410440	See?
3410440	3410940	Stop.
3413580	3415980	That's our new mascot, by the way, is Dalek Sec.
3415980	3418060	Because the ferret's at the OLR Studios, so.
3423580	3424660	See?
3424660	3425180	Anyway.
3425180	3425820	Oh, god.
3425820	3427740	Doesn't quite have the charm of the ferret.
3427740	3436620	Not quite as charming as the ferret.
3436620	3437540	I had to.
3437540	3438220	Kind of annoying.
3438220	3440260	I kind of wish I could be exterminated for real.
3440260	3441140	Anyway.
3441140	3446220	So new game coming out for the iPhone, which makes me happy
3446220	3447620	because it's one of my favorites,
3447620	3449460	and I have to think about getting it now,
3449460	3452220	is Dick Doug Remix.
3452220	3456780	It is out for $5.99 on the iTunes App Store.
3456780	3462100	And you have a D-pad and a flick mode.
3462100	3467620	The flick will let you fling dirt around
3467620	3470700	by flicking your finger on the screen and what?
3470700	3473100	I'm just laughing at the concept of taking dirt around
3473100	3475100	with your finger.
3475100	3477860	Now with enhanced moving dirt technology.
3477860	3479780	And you have enhanced shovels so you
3479780	3483700	can dig faster and balloon blocks to protect you
3483700	3485180	from falling rocks.
3485180	3488820	And hey, it looks pretty fun.
3488820	3493460	It's definitely got big air pumping power.
3493460	3495860	So yay.
3495860	3499340	The chat room is commenting on the Dalek being a new mascot.
3499340	3501380	Brad from Pod Culture is suggesting
3501380	3503940	Capcom versus Dalek versus ferret.
3503940	3505980	And Act F adds on to that versus Clicky.
3505980	3509340	So somebody needs to hit up Mujin quick.
3509340	3513060	We'll just dump Shermie on them and they'll all die.
3513060	3513620	All right.
3513620	3516380	Shermie will cute them to death.
3516380	3518100	He'll purr them to death.
3518100	3519380	All right, moving on.
3519380	3521540	Loki, what do you got for us?
3521540	3524860	Well, I've got some interesting information.
3524860	3528500	Of course, right around the corner, we've got BlizzCon.
3528500	3532100	And I really heard this week tickets went on sale.
3532100	3535700	And of course, they sell out very fast.
3535700	3539660	And this probably is not helping slow that down any.
3539660	3543780	But Blizzard has confirmed that the special pet
3543780	3545700	you will get for attending BlizzCon
3545700	3550340	will be the Grunty the Marine Murloc.
3550340	3552620	Yes, it's Murloc dressed up like one of the Space
3552620	3556300	Marines from StarCraft.
3556300	3559100	And there are people that will pay lots of money for it.
3559100	3560660	Yes, in fact, some of the tickets
3560660	3563980	have already gone out on eBay already,
3563980	3565380	which is not a surprise.
3565380	3567700	And hopefully you were there early
3567700	3570020	to get your tickets for the first round
3570020	3572780	because they sold out within 30 minutes.
3572780	3573820	I didn't talk to Extifer.
3573820	3574940	I didn't see if he got his ticket.
3574940	3576300	I know he was trying to go.
3576300	3577660	I don't think he's going to go.
3577660	3580220	He said he didn't want it because the tickets are $125
3580220	3580500	now.
3580500	3582020	Oh, dang.
3582020	3582580	Wow.
3582580	3583460	Yeah.
3583460	3585500	And he was trying to get me to go.
3585500	3588020	But he doesn't want me to go to Penny Arcade Expo.
3588020	3589640	He says I should go to BlizzCon instead.
3589640	3591820	But dude, Seattle.
3591820	3595140	And Penny Arcade Expo is kind of awesome.
3595140	3597060	BlizzCon's too limiting for me.
3597060	3599340	But if you can't afford to go to BlizzCon
3599340	3601540	and you don't get a ticket, you can, however,
3601540	3604660	for the first time, watch the event on DirecTV
3604660	3608900	or online for $39.99.
3608900	3611300	So I should pay an additional $40 to the company.
3611300	3613540	I'm already paying $15 a month too.
3613540	3615540	Hey, well, if you want to see all the stuff that
3615540	3617660	will be covered probably on other press sites.
3617660	3620300	It will be on the internet in 30 seconds
3620300	3621740	after it's on this channel.
3621740	3623580	Wow Insider, one of those wow sites.
3623580	3624660	There's a billion of them out there.
3624660	3625740	Not even 30 seconds.
3625740	3627260	They will be live blogging that shit.
3627260	3630300	Have you ever noticed that all the top podcasts right now
3630300	3633100	on iTunes, like if you look at gaming, almost half of them
3633100	3634780	are Warcraft podcasts.
3634780	3637580	I'm like, dude, if we wanted to be super famous,
3637580	3639320	we'd just talk about Warcraft all the time.
3639320	3640780	Because that's apparently what makes
3640780	3642020	you popular on the internet.
3642020	3643940	Just kind of surprised me.
3643940	3647240	I thought it would be way too saturated for Warcraft podcasts.
3647240	3649380	But they do very well.
3649380	3651620	Which, by the way, reminds me, be kind.
3651620	3652940	Rate us a five in iTunes.
3652940	3654380	They have a new rating system now.
3654380	3655780	Even if you've written a review for the show,
3655780	3658220	you can go back and rate the show five stars.
3658220	3660500	And by the way, thanks so much to those
3660500	3661620	that have already done it.
3661620	3664580	Because we are on page one right now of the podcast.
3664580	3666100	That makes us very happy.
3666100	3667700	Because word of mouth's all we got
3667700	3668940	to spread the word of the show.
3668940	3670220	So that's all we ask.
3670220	3671900	Thank you.
3671900	3674860	So let's see.
3674860	3677700	Tora, by the way, in chat is mentioning something
3677700	3682620	about Nintendo Power and the whole Capcom vs. Tatsunoko
3682620	3683140	thing.
3683140	3683860	Let me read this.
3683860	3685900	My ex has scans of the Nintendo Power talking
3685900	3687660	about Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.
3687660	3690140	There's three characters missing from the roster.
3690140	3692420	Two of them don't have licensing over here in the States.
3692420	3694060	He's sending them to me now, ha ha.
3694060	3695580	So that doesn't surprise me at all.
3695580	3696840	That's kind of what we were saying earlier,
3696840	3699380	is that prepare that there might be some roster changes.
3699380	3700700	But they'll try to sell it to you.
3700700	3702780	They'll add more stuff back in.
3702780	3704420	We'll see.
3704420	3705660	We'll see.
3705660	3706380	OK.
3706380	3707980	Anyhow, so BlizzCon.
3707980	3708820	Yeah, I don't know.
3708820	3711320	I think I'm going to pass this year in favor of just reading
3711320	3712360	about it on the internet.
3712360	3715940	There's $125 for a pet or even $40 for the pet.
3715940	3717660	No, thank you.
3717660	3722420	I mean, wow is cool and all, but it's not that cool.
3722420	3724020	Also, what is that cool?
3724020	3725100	You know who is that cool?
3725100	3726100	Steve Weeby.
3726100	3728100	He is that cool.
3728100	3732060	And some companies are willing to pay more than $40
3732060	3733260	in the name of Steve Weeby.
3733260	3735780	In fact, Stride Gum apparently is
3735780	3741060	going to be spending $10,001 in quarters.
3741060	3744980	That's a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum,
3744980	3747180	is their little tagline for Stride Gum,
3747180	3750300	if Steve Weeby accomplishes the task
3750300	3753540	of taking over the Donkey Kong world record at this year's E3.
3753540	3756700	So apparently, what's going to happen,
3756700	3758140	the reward will be paid.
3758140	3761980	If Weeby does beat Billy Mitchell's record score,
3761980	3764060	then apparently Stride is going to provide him
3764060	3768340	with a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum
3768340	3771780	and $10,001 in quarters.
3771780	3773460	Huh.
3773460	3775620	So I have the names of the people cut
3775620	3777500	from Tatsunoko versus Capcom.
3777500	3778940	Oh, who's that?
3778940	3783860	It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.
3783860	3787940	Hm, there they are.
3787940	3790100	Well, you know, again, it was probably a licensing thing,
3790100	3792900	but does this mean maybe Capcom characters will replace them
3792900	3794420	or just get used to it?
3794420	3795700	I didn't hear who.
3795700	3799860	I said Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.
3799860	3804060	So what are you QQing about over there, Darusakura?
3804060	3806820	Dude, Joe's awesome.
3806820	3811580	All right, more to come on the whole King of Kong debacle,
3811580	3814100	which still goes on to this day at E3.
3814100	3815980	But for now, more news.
3815980	3818540	There's a game that I have been banging myself in the head
3818540	3822140	over trying to make myself understand and remember
3822140	3824620	that much Japanese to be able to play it properly.
3824620	3827220	And I've kind of hit an impasse.
3827220	3828580	But Ragnarok DS.
3828580	3833100	Well, thankfully, I won't have to give myself a migraine
3833100	3834260	every time I try to play it.
3834260	3836020	And it's a fun game, don't get me wrong.
3836020	3836540	I love it.
3836540	3838420	I'm all like, yeah.
3838420	3845180	But XSeed is having a match-up with Gung Ho Works
3845180	3848780	to bring Ragnarok Online DS out in the winter.
3848780	3850460	So that makes me happy.
3850460	3852980	Pourings for all, yay.
3852980	3855020	I just know the first town you have to go
3855020	3857940	is Prontera, just to let you know.
3857940	3858980	But I love the game.
3858980	3862100	And especially for people who, like me,
3862100	3864580	have been playing RO for like ever.
3864580	3866300	Addict.
3866300	3869100	I haven't touched the game in a month and a half, Rob.
3869100	3870580	I haven't touched WoW a lot lately.
3870580	3871540	You'd be proud of me.
3871540	3873180	Well, I've just been so busy.
3873180	3874660	It's not that I don't want to play WoW.
3874660	3876340	I just kind of had other stuff going on.
3876340	3877700	I've had way too much to do.
3877700	3882740	But the whole part of the game, the story of the game
3882740	3887500	is that you play a guy named Ares, who meets this girl.
3887500	3891580	And she's a job class that does not exist in the game at all.
3891580	3892900	But she's there.
3892900	3895980	And you have to, she's lost her memory.
3895980	3898140	And you have to help her, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3898140	3902300	You can change the rest of your job and everything.
3902300	3908020	But it's pretty much RPG with RO flavor.
3908020	3911180	Now, Death Wishing in Chat at chat.orangetraday.com,
3911180	3912940	live on this Sunday night, is sharing
3912940	3915780	that he could never get into Ragnarok.
3915780	3919180	Because there was no quest, and he likes quest-based MMOs.
3919180	3921540	So does this DS game kind of add the whole quest element?
3921540	3922940	I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
3922940	3924020	They're not being quests.
3924020	3927340	Because there's quests aplenty in RO.
3927340	3929500	Is that something they added later?
3929500	3931780	Because it seems like when I was playing like years ago,
3931780	3932300	they didn't have them.
3932300	3933740	Rob, you were playing with me in the beta.
3933740	3934020	I know.
3934020	3934740	It was years ago.
3934740	3936100	So they have them now, though.
3936100	3937940	Yeah, dude, there's even a quest.
3937940	3939980	And it's like a really simple, easy, stupid quest
3939980	3942980	where you get a bajillion experience points just
3942980	3944180	for doing it.
3944180	3947100	And you've got the ones that give you experience points,
3947100	3949780	the ones questing for items.
3949780	3951180	Especially the questing for items,
3951180	3954060	that's how you get some of the really rare crap in the game.
3954060	3956420	I have to admit, there's a tiny, tiny part of me,
3956420	3958940	just very, very tiny, but a tiny, tiny part of me
3958940	3960940	that kind of wants to go back and check out RO.
3960940	3961940	Play on the server I play on.
3961940	3963500	But there's also a tiny, tiny part of me
3963500	3965220	that wants to do the same for Final Fantasy XI.
3965220	3966420	Play on the server I play on.
3966420	3968220	But I also know my guildies in WoW
3968220	3970700	would kill me in the face if I did something like that.
3970700	3972580	And I don't want to be killed in the face.
3972580	3973460	Play Ragnarok with me.
3973460	3974420	It's free.
3974420	3974940	We'll see.
3974940	3975580	Play on the server I play on.
3975580	3976620	We'll see.
3976620	3978940	I don't have time for more crack right now.
3978940	3980380	I'm a busy boy.
3980380	3980900	We'll see.
3980900	3983100	Maybe after E3 when things settle down a little bit.
3983100	3984380	We'll see.
3984380	3986340	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.
3986340	3988740	Then we got the Classic Game of the Week coming up.
3988740	3990740	Well, the Classic Game Flashback is now
3990740	3996700	available on the App Store for your iPhone or iPod Touch.
3996700	4000620	However, there's something a little interesting about it.
4000620	4003260	The game itself is $4.99.
4003260	4008100	And it's basically a port of the Amiga version.
4008100	4013460	However, apparently Pocket Gamer has done a report on the game.
4013460	4017260	And they said that basically you're paying for an emulator.
4017260	4021940	And then the ROM is downloaded independently
4021940	4023700	using the emulator, I guess.
4023700	4028140	And so because of that, it's not exactly designed for the iPhone.
4028140	4032940	And it's kind of wonky as far as the controls go.
4032940	4034020	Uh-oh.
4034020	4035180	Another Mega Man 2.
4035180	4036460	Yeah, I was going to say, sadly, there's
4036460	4037660	been a couple of those on the iPhone,
4037660	4039620	hasn't there, where there have been emulators.
4039620	4040740	Not just on the iPhone.
4040740	4042500	You kind of get the sense that maybe on Xbox Live
4042500	4044260	you get a lot of that too, where it's just
4044260	4047740	you're basically paying $5 for an emulator in the ROM.
4047740	4050420	Well, hell, that is what you're paying for on the Wii.
4050420	4051620	But it's a little different.
4051620	4053700	Because Nintendo put out the Wii and Nintendo
4053700	4055540	put out all those games.
4055540	4057820	So a little different.
4057820	4059780	Anyhow, one more story for you guys.
4059780	4061980	And it has to do with a really funny guy.
4061980	4064780	I don't know if you ever watched The Soup, which is a show on E,
4064780	4065880	but it's awesome.
4065880	4068540	It's hosted by a guy named Joel McHale, who's pretty funny.
4068540	4070580	And yes, this does tie into video games.
4070580	4072680	Because Joel McHale is apparently
4072680	4076100	going to be giving the Ubisoft press conference this year
4076100	4077420	at E3.
4077420	4078380	Interesting.
4078380	4082100	He also was appearing live in LA that same week.
4082100	4082740	Oh, funny.
4082740	4084140	On the 6th.
4084140	4085900	Or wait, wherever that Friday is.
4085900	4087820	Well, I'm sure that show tapes in LA too.
4087820	4089860	So it's probably just roll out of bed and into the show
4089860	4091140	for him, you know what I mean?
4091140	4093420	So that's pretty cool, though, that he's
4093420	4094980	going to be doing that E3.
4094980	4097560	Apparently, you will be able to watch the whole thing yourself
4097560	4098220	the next day.
4098220	4100420	It will be available on Ubisoft's website.
4100420	4101260	That's pretty cool.
4101260	4102180	I plan on doing it.
4102180	4103060	Absolutely.
4103060	4104500	If we can't get tickets in person,
4104500	4108380	because they hating on the independent media.
4108380	4110820	I think that's actually the day before I arrive.
4110820	4112580	Oh, bummer.
4112580	4113540	Bummer, bummer.
4113540	4115140	All right, it's time.
4115140	4117140	We're finally going to get into the classic video
4117140	4117800	game of the week.
4117800	4118100	That's right.
4118100	4119760	We'd like to take some time on the show
4119760	4121900	every week to dig into the archives.
4121900	4124140	And Dark Soccer digs into her vault.
4124140	4127180	And now I have seen the vault. It's a very impressive vault.
4127180	4128900	And she pulls out one game that she
4128900	4130780	thinks you guys should pay some respect to.
4130780	4134340	So it's time to pay me tribute.
4134340	4135180	Pay her tribute.
4135180	4136420	Pay her classic game tribute.
4136420	4137380	The classic of the week.
4137380	4139540	What should the kids be playing this week, Dark Soccer?
4139540	4141580	Pac-Man.
4141580	4142980	Well, now that's a classic.
4142980	4144220	Yeah.
4144220	4146780	And actually, it was suggested to me by Sauce.
4146780	4150900	So I thought it was actually very, very, very a good one
4150900	4151560	to put in there.
4151560	4153940	And really, a whole year plus of doing this segment,
4153940	4155300	and you've never done Pac-Man.
4155300	4155820	Amazing.
4155820	4156320	Nope.
4160660	4162100	This is Pac-Man.
4162100	4164300	Basically, if you don't know how to play Pac-Man,
4164300	4167420	then you've been living with your head under the dirt
4167420	4168900	forever.
4168900	4171020	For decades.
4171020	4173140	Basically, it's a maze game.
4173140	4174860	You play as a little circular guy
4174860	4176300	who runs around eating dots.
4176300	4177980	And he's chased by ghosts.
4177980	4182020	And if you eat a big dot, you can chase the ghost.
4182020	4185100	Did you get Chermey to talk?
4185100	4187140	Hey, baby.
4187140	4187900	Hey, radio.
4187900	4188400	Not kiddie.
4188400	4190460	Yeah, Chermey on mic now.
4190460	4193980	So anyway, really what I wanted to bring up
4193980	4197140	about this is the Pac-Man franchise,
4197140	4199140	which has gone kablooey.
4202100	4207380	Also, it is possible to get a perfect game of Pac-Man,
4207380	4210260	but it was only done by the world's biggest asshole, Billy
4210260	4213100	Mitchell.
4213100	4219860	And there also was an eight-year-old boy
4219860	4225180	who, in 1982, made it through the split screen level, which
4225180	4232340	is basically what happens when it basically gets over more
4232340	4234700	than what the memory of the game can handle,
4234700	4237500	because it just basically recalculates every time
4237500	4238160	it goes through.
4241300	4243820	So the game was actually made by Namco, brought up
4243820	4245500	by Midway in America.
4245500	4250060	And the way that the name of the game
4250060	4255580	came around was from a Japanese phrase, paku paku taberu.
4255580	4258820	Paku paku is the sound the mouth makes
4258820	4263820	when open and closed right away.
4263820	4265020	I never do that.
4265020	4271100	So basically, and taberu is to eat.
4271100	4274860	So basically, the character is supposed
4274860	4276780	to sort of look like pizza, missing a piece.
4279980	4286180	So as it came out, it went kind of meh in Japan.
4286180	4289420	But when Midway grabbed it over here,
4289420	4292780	it was totally, totally, totally explosive.
4292780	4293820	It went crazy.
4293820	4296180	And everyone liked it, because all they really had before
4296180	4298620	was Space Invaders, that realm.
4302620	4304580	Yeah, the music's getting a little monotonous here.
4304580	4306180	So I thought maybe we could switch it up a little bit,
4306180	4309100	and I'll play something else for the Classic Game of the Week
4309100	4309620	here.
4316500	4318780	Well, we can play a little bit of background music here.
4318780	4321580	OK, anyway.
4321580	4328060	So also, since Pac-Man made it really, really happy over here,
4328060	4332420	that also we're able to bring out a few other games,
4332420	4336460	like Rally-X. And Pac-Man actually
4336460	4340660	even surpassed Asteroids as the best-selling arcade
4340660	4345540	game of all time when it was released.
4345540	4350140	So basically, we can just say that Pac-Man was,
4350140	4355820	I want to say, the game that really propelled video games
4355820	4358020	more closer to the mainstream, apart from just
4358020	4359700	being something for kids.
4359700	4362020	I remember being little and seeing adults playing it.
4362020	4365100	I remember playing Pac-Man on roller skates.
4365100	4367060	Yes, Pac-Man on roller skates.
4367060	4370100	I remember roller skating to this song
4370100	4372060	that's playing in the background right now.
4372060	4373100	That was hardcore.
4373100	4375980	Well, also, I have somewhere in the vault,
4375980	4380180	or actually not in the vault, in the garage, a Pac-Man plushie
4380180	4381540	with the little ghost in his mouth
4381540	4384380	wearing a t-shirt and everything that came out in the 80s.
4384380	4386820	You know, I had Pac-Man glasses, the glasses
4386820	4388740	that they had at Burger King, or was it?
4388740	4389540	You remember those?
4389540	4391380	I had the Pac-Man board game.
4391380	4392420	I remember that.
4392420	4395100	And I seem to recall there was Pac-Man cereal,
4395100	4396500	if I'm not mistaking.
4396500	4398740	And I'm pretty sure I had that, too.
4398740	4400340	Well, I'll tell you something else
4400340	4402060	that this might be interesting.
4402060	4405340	In Japan, it was actually called Pac-Man.
4405340	4407540	And they changed it to Pac-Man because they
4407540	4410420	were afraid that vandals were going to change the P to an F,
4410420	4412100	so it would be Pac-Man.
4412100	4412740	That's awesome.
4412740	4413940	You can still find Pac-Man.
4413940	4416980	I'm not sure they did in ROMs somewhere.
4416980	4417480	Sure.
4417480	4420500	You can still find Pac-Man machines in Europe,
4420500	4423380	apparently.
4423380	4426420	I want a Pac-Man machine.
4426420	4429620	Now, let's go ahead and talk about sequels.
4429620	4431140	Well, actually, the different ports.
4431140	4435940	There was the Apple II series, Atari 2600, Atari 5200,
4435940	4440340	the 8-bit computers, IBM, the early IBM PC, and television
4440340	4442420	Commodore 64 NES.
4442420	4445340	On handheld, we had Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket
4445340	4447500	Color, which I have.
4447500	4449700	Actually, I've got so many versions of this damn game.
4449700	4451940	Christ, it's only a three-hour show, you know.
4451940	4453900	There were just all the different versions.
4453900	4456940	And, of course, we have them all in the Namco Museum,
4456940	4458020	Xbox Live Arcade.
4458020	4461420	We've got the Championship Edition.
4461420	4469900	My favorite to this date is the one on GameCube.
4469900	4470820	Hi, baby.
4470820	4472740	Sorry, it's my cat.
4472740	4477740	Where you play as the ghost.
4477740	4480580	Stop trying to get your cats to talk during the segment.
4480580	4483380	Where you play as the ghost trying to catch Pac-Man.
4483380	4484620	That one was pretty fun.
4484620	4489540	So, since then, and by the way, I love the little flashing
4489540	4493460	thing on this article, because the Atari 2600 version sucked.
4493460	4495260	Sucked.
4495260	4496580	Sorry.
4496580	4498340	Yeah, I do have it.
4498340	4499620	Sequels.
4499620	4502180	Dude, do we have spin-offs and sequels?
4502180	4507580	We have Ms. Pac-Man, which Ms. Pac-Man was great.
4507580	4510940	Um, Super Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, Junior Pac-Man, Pac and
4510940	4513620	Pal, Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp.
4513620	4515900	I think Chomp Chomp was his dog, wasn't it?
4515900	4518460	We have Professor Pac-Man, which was an unauthorized one
4518460	4519860	that Midway created.
4519860	4526820	Pac-Land, which I've actually got on the PC Engine duo.
4526820	4528940	By the way, this is for you, DarkSakura.
4528940	4530820	This is just for you here.
4530820	4531420	If I can get to it.
4531420	4532300	Is it a 7-Up commercial?
4532300	4533940	No.
4533940	4535060	Even worse.
4535060	4537980	Far worse.
4537980	4541140	Oh, fuck.
4541140	4543740	That's the Atari 2600 version.
4543740	4545420	Has everybody's ears bleed?
4545420	4549860	We had Pac-Mania, which is actually a really, really good
4549860	4550980	follow-up game.
4550980	4554900	Pac-Man VR, Pac-Man Arrangement, which was in the
4554900	4557780	Namco Classics Volume 2.
4557780	4561540	Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga Class of 81, Pac and Party.
4561540	4564140	Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Frogger Classic Combo, Pac-Man 25th
4564140	4566060	Anniversary, and then Pinball.
4566060	4569220	We had Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man, which was created specifically
4569220	4569900	by Midway.
4569900	4572740	And we had Baby Pac-Man, another unauthorized one,
4572740	4576340	which is a game I really want in the collection, even though
4576340	4580100	it kind of sucks ass to play, because it's a combination
4580100	4581420	pinball video game.
4581420	4584260	It actually, I think, was one of the inspirations, I want
4584260	4585660	to say, eventually, for what gave us the
4585660	4588900	Pinball 2000 franchise.
4588900	4591740	Also for console, we had Pac-Attack, Pac-Man 2, Pac in
4591740	4595820	Time, Pac-Man World, Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness.
4595820	4597380	Dude, there's so many different ones.
4597380	4603980	Pac-Man Carnival this year, multiple home versions, all
4603980	4605220	kinds of stuff.
4605220	4607100	So yeah, we have had.
4607100	4611120	I would have to say that my favorite Pac-Man game in the
4611120	4616580	series, overall, just as far as fun to play, is Super Pac-Man.
4616580	4618180	That's what I was just loading up right now.
4618180	4619260	I love Super Pac-Man.
4619260	4621740	That game is so much fun.
4621740	4625180	And of course, there were clones like Funny Man and
4625180	4626420	blah, blah, blah.
4630100	4631420	Now, this was kind of cool.
4631420	4634100	And I remember reading up on this a while back that there
4634100	4636880	were a bunch of students that went to Simon Fraser
4636880	4640820	University, who did Lifesize Pac-Man, who used laptops and
4640820	4644580	mobile phone GPS to track where the dots were and where
4644580	4646100	Pac-Man was.
4646100	4650900	And it is now played regularly in downtown Vancouver.
4650900	4655100	There's also another one that's Pac-Manhatten, where
4655100	4659140	Pac-Man is played around Washington Square Park.
4659140	4660540	And I've actually seen video of that one.
4660540	4663220	That one's pretty cool.
4663220	4667620	Actually, they were going to do a Pac-Man movie in 2004.
4667620	4669420	Crystal Sky Pictures said they were going to do it.
4669420	4670940	And no.
4670940	4673340	Thank god, because it would have been terrible.
4673340	4676580	It was supposed to be $200 million.
4679580	4681700	And as you heard in the background, there was Pac-Man
4681700	4684860	Fever, which was just put out for fun.
4684860	4687580	And it actually made it to number nine on
4687580	4690020	Billboard Hot 100 charts.
4690020	4696620	Guinness World Records gave Pac-Man eight records in 2008,
4696620	4698500	including first perfect Pac-Man game for Billy
4698500	4701840	Mitchell, asshole, most successful coin-operated game,
4701840	4704660	largest Pac-Man game for Pac-Manhatten.
4709660	4713180	Really, it's been sort of a generation-defining game.
4713180	4715740	And also, Rob, now you have to find this, because we have to
4715740	4717080	play this.
4717080	4722500	There was the Pac-Man 7-Up commercial, set sort of to a
4722500	4725420	modified tune like Betty Davis' eyes.
4725420	4727500	I would be happy to, but act-deaf is going to have a
4727500	4729980	coronary if you don't mention Pac-Man Championship Edition.
4729980	4730700	I did.
4730700	4731700	Oh, you must have missed it.
4731700	4735660	Amongst the gazillion other Pac-Man games you mentioned.
4735660	4738340	Of course, I'm sure you mentioned the Pac-Man animated
4738340	4738980	series.
4738980	4740220	Oh, yes.
4740220	4755140	We'll look at each other.
4755140	4756380	This is creepy.
4768220	4769900	This is very creepy.
4769900	4771140	Only in the Amex.
4776620	4778020	This is actually on TV.
4778020	4778700	Yes, it was.
4778700	4781260	I don't remember ever seeing this.
4781260	4782100	This is kind of scary.
4782100	4783340	All right.
4783340	4784420	Just look down in the chatroom for
4784420	4785260	what you want us to watch.
4785260	4787500	Sure, sure.
4787500	4791540	You see what I mean by the sound of Betty Davis' eyes?
4791540	4793540	Oh, yeah, I hear it.
4793540	4795900	Hold on, I'm going to fire up my favorite Pac-Man parody
4795900	4797460	while Jamie finishes up the game.
4797460	4799100	Oh, I'm pretty much done.
4799100	4801980	But yeah, Pac-Man.
4801980	4805860	OK, this is my favorite frickin' Pac-Man
4805860	4807660	parody they ever had, OK?
4807660	4809260	This is like the best thing ever.
4809260	4810500	Here we go.
4818580	4820700	Math Man, your mission is?
4820700	4822460	Math Man is not here.
4822460	4824380	Oh, where is he?
4824380	4826260	He's in the math room.
4826260	4827340	OK.
4827340	4830740	Mr. Glitch, your mission is to eat all the pentagons on the
4830740	4832780	board and no other polygons.
4832780	4834580	When you encounter a polygon, you'll have to be
4834580	4836580	health-free to make her to see.
4836580	4837940	Thank you very much.
4837940	4838940	End of discussion.
4838940	4840100	There is no further debate.
4840100	4842540	Math Man was the greatest.
4842540	4843740	Forget that 7UP commercial.
4843740	4844980	Math Man was the bomb.
4844980	4846260	All right.
4846260	4846740	That's it.
4846740	4848740	We're going to take a break now here on
4848740	4849860	Orange Lawns Radio.
4849860	4852500	And if you're listening on the podcast, the good news is you
4852500	4853900	only have to wait like 10 seconds.
4853900	4855660	For those of you listening live, we need a moment to
4855660	4859180	stretch and refill our drinks and so forth and have a little
4859180	4860100	break here in studio.
4860100	4862340	But we'll be back in just a few more minutes here with
4862340	4865060	more of Orange Lawns Radio and some stories coming up.
4865060	4867700	Xbox 360, we've barely touched on what's going on in
4867700	4868780	Microsoft's world.
4868780	4870900	Their whole damn E3 lineup might have just
4870900	4872820	leaked to the internet.
4872820	4875800	We'll discuss what's been leaked and if it carries any
4875800	4876500	weight or not.
4876500	4877940	We'll be back in a little bit with more
4877940	4879380	of Orange Lawns Radio.
4879380	4884260	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lawns Radio on this
4884260	4888420	lovely Sunday evening, May the 17th of 2009.
4888420	4892660	We tape live every Sunday here at All Games Radio.
4892660	4894660	That's www.allgames.com.
4894660	4899860	We follow the Bobby Blackwolf Show at Roughly.
4899860	4900820	See, we're amateur radio.
4900820	4901740	We can't speak right.
4901740	4902620	Bobby Blackwolf.
4902620	4904740	The Bobbily Bobbily.
4904740	4905660	Jeez, Louise.
4905660	4907620	OK, the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
4907620	4911020	Which is at Roughly 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, 9
4911020	4913300	o'clock Eastern Time every Sunday night, right here on
4913300	4914420	All Games Radio.
4914420	4917540	It's a fun time, so you should definitely tune in.
4917540	4920220	Anyhow, we've got more gaming news to get back into.
4920220	4922980	It's myself and Loki and Dark Soccer all joining you on this
4922980	4923860	lovely evening.
4923860	4925820	And I was just thinking, how funny would it be if somebody
4925820	4928620	didn't get the memo that we moved studios tonight and was
4928620	4930420	showing up at the old studio unannounced?
4930420	4931820	Funny for us, not for them.
4931820	4933260	Yeah, I know exactly.
4933260	4934940	Funny, not funny.
4934940	4937780	All right, we have some Xbox 360 news to get
4937780	4938860	into right now.
4938860	4940380	Loki.
4940380	4946740	Apparently, there's a new Xbox exclusive coming.
4946740	4950300	And this is coming from a new company that Microsoft has
4950300	4952660	purchased, Big Park.
4952660	4957540	And apparently, they're responsible for such
4957540	4960180	franchises, or at least they had a hand in it, for Need
4960180	4962540	for Speed, SSX, and NBA Street.
4962540	4966300	And this new game, though, is supposed to be something that
4966300	4971020	will broaden audiences and will be playable at E3.
4971020	4971820	Huh.
4971820	4972980	Let me guess.
4972980	4975660	Could it be something that ties in with that motion
4975660	4978140	camera that doesn't exist?
4978140	4982060	That could be like a Wii Sports type of game.
4982060	4983260	I'm going to guess yes.
4983260	4984460	That's probably what it's going to be.
4984460	4988380	Well, that is a completely baseless guess right there.
4988380	4989260	How dare you, sir?
4989260	4989820	What do I know?
4989820	4993740	I'm not an industry analyst.
4993740	4995500	So I apparently know nothing about this.
4995500	4998140	What exactly does it take to have the title industry
4998140	4998780	analyst?
4998780	5001340	Because maybe I would like to just have that after my name.
5001340	5003580	Kiss enough ass to get promoted.
5003580	5004980	Well, I promote myself.
5004980	5005940	How's that?
5005940	5008500	At Orange Lawns Radio, I am the industry analyst.
5008500	5009500	I just promoted myself.
5009500	5014060	Well, you have to be, I guess, on call with big companies
5014060	5019420	and have to make a, or have to be on call with big companies.
5019420	5020780	Or help them make decisions.
5020780	5021260	I don't know.
5021260	5022860	I can do that.
5022860	5025260	I'd be good at that.
5025260	5026540	Whatever.
5026540	5026860	All right.
5026860	5030060	Well, anyhow, moving on with some other gaming news.
5030060	5033580	By the way, I forgot to mention it at the top of the hour.
5033580	5036860	But we are going to still be giving away that Smile DK
5036860	5040620	signed copy of PlayStation 2 DDR Supernova 2.
5040620	5042460	We're going to give that away in a little while.
5042460	5043500	We'll probably do it around, yeah, we'll
5043500	5046620	do it around the mailbag segment a little later this hour.
5046620	5049900	Anyhow, we got some news from Q Entertainment
5049900	5051420	has filed a trademark.
5051420	5053900	Now, of course, you know I love me some Q Entertainment.
5053900	5055820	They're the folks that put out Luminous.
5055820	5059740	And let's see, they put out, well, they put out Luminous.
5059740	5060220	Res.
5060220	5060700	No, I'm just kidding.
5060700	5062380	Yeah, they res every extend extra.
5063580	5065420	If you want to trace back Mizuguchi,
5065420	5067180	who's behind Q Games, he did such great things
5067180	5068300	to Space Channel 5.
5068300	5069180	99 Nights?
5069180	5071340	Yeah, well, we just overlooked 99 Nights.
5071340	5073340	Hopefully, this game is going to be amazing.
5073340	5076700	It's called Guardian Hearts, is the name of the trademark.
5077340	5079660	Now, you want to keep in mind, this is just
5079660	5081100	a trademark that's been filed.
5081660	5083820	Nothing is definitely concrete about this yet.
5083820	5084300	We don't know.
5084300	5086380	It could, you know, games sometimes change names
5086380	5087660	and so on and so forth.
5087660	5091420	However, I hold out hope that somehow Mizuguchi
5091420	5093740	got the rights to make the sequel to Guardian Legend,
5093740	5095340	and it's called Guardian Hearts.
5095340	5096780	That's what I'm holding out for.
5096780	5097740	Not bloody likely.
5097740	5098780	Yeah, not bloody likely.
5098780	5101260	But it does sound, it doesn't sound a little role playing-ish
5101260	5101580	to you.
5101580	5103020	Doesn't it?
5103020	5103580	Like a little bit?
5103580	5105820	Like, Guardian Hearts kind of sounds role playing-ish.
5105820	5107180	Or magical girl game.
5107180	5108700	So, well, that could be fun too.
5108700	5111020	But either way, you know, I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi,
5111020	5114220	so I would be very happy if he's doing a role playing game,
5114220	5116140	as long as it's not like 99 Nights.
5116780	5117740	But there you have it.
5117740	5119900	Guardian Hearts possibly coming soon.
5119900	5120380	Who knows?
5120380	5122700	Maybe as soon as E3, but don't hold your breath.
5122700	5127820	Well, Telltale has some new episodic series for E3.
5127820	5133020	They are, um, well, they're not saying what it is,
5133020	5135820	but then again, these are the people that gave us Sam & Max
5135820	5137820	and Showing Bads Cool Game for Attractive People
5137820	5138780	and Wallace & Gromit.
5141340	5145420	But it's also going to commemorate, as far as I'm aware,
5145420	5147420	the fifth year anniversary for the company,
5147420	5148300	which is pretty cool.
5148300	5150780	Especially making it while the market's gone to shit.
5151500	5155180	So, um, hopefully it'll be something really cool.
5155180	5155820	I'm sure it will.
5155820	5159180	Everything they've put out so far, you know, recently has been pretty cool.
5160220	5165900	And also, um, for, uh, uh, people who like a good deal,
5165900	5169660	the entire season of Strong Bads Cool Game for Attractive People
5169660	5172220	is half price on Steam until Monday.
5173420	5174460	Yikes. Better hurry.
5174460	5175020	Yep.
5175020	5175740	That's pretty cool.
5176780	5177180	All right.
5177180	5180380	Well, uh, I know I'm, uh, I'm curious to see what they cook up next.
5180380	5181660	That company's been doing very well.
5181660	5182060	You're right.
5182060	5183900	I think one point you made there is they've been doing pretty well
5183900	5186220	in the face of a company's closing and so forth.
5186220	5187980	Day of the Tentacle! Day of the Tentacle! Day of the Tentacle!
5187980	5189820	Uh, don't hold your breath, but you never know.
5189820	5190700	You never know.
5190700	5192300	It's the only Luke Starts franchise-
5192300	5195180	Well, one of them that they haven't touched yet.
5195740	5196860	Day of the Tentacle! Come on!
5198380	5199580	That's what we need.
5199580	5200700	More Maniac Mansion.
5201580	5203340	Um, anyways.
5203340	5206140	So, I don't know.
5206140	5210540	Other than, uh, Day of the Tentacle, what more can we talk about?
5210540	5211260	I know!
5211260	5219900	How about the supposed, and this is all rumor, lineup for a Microsoft press conference?
5220540	5227980	Apparently, there is a new industry source, or somebody that's claiming to be an industry source,
5228860	5236220	in tradition of Surfer Girl, who apparently has gone into retirement from leaking information.
5236220	5240380	Um, Game Fork. This is coming from Twitter.
5240380	5245740	And they have been tweeting about different things coming from the Microsoft press conference.
5246380	5247500	Um, including-
5247500	5249500	So it's not like your normal Twitter where it's like,
5249500	5252220	I just ate a ham sandwich and it was delicious.
5252220	5253340	No, it's not.
5253340	5254460	BRB pooping.
5256060	5256620	Not quite.
5257420	5260540	By the way, if you want to join the OLR Twitter, we don't put Twits like that.
5260540	5264380	We just like to remind you when the show is live and post other little tidbits about the show,
5264380	5267980	but we will not share when we are pooping like other people do on Twitter.
5267980	5270780	Like you have time to type that, if you gotta go, you gotta go.
5271420	5272460	Unless you lie about it.
5272460	5275180	But you can, you know, instead of reading a magazine, you could Twitter from the potty,
5275180	5280060	and I've seen, I've actually, I have a friend that has updated her Facebook status
5280060	5282140	to say, hi, I'm on the toilet.
5284300	5284800	Nice.
5286540	5288460	That's the day and age we live in.
5288460	5293980	Well, um, apparently, uh, here are some of the things that were on that list.
5293980	5298700	Starting off with, of course, they're going to reveal a new motion sensing camera controller.
5298700	5301020	It's going to be called the Xbox Fluid.
5301740	5305980	Um, apparently they're going to end the whole thing with a finale.
5305980	5312140	And I don't know if I can believe this, but Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus Oxide.
5312140	5317740	It's apparently a rumor of the X, or a Xbox 360 port with, you know, kind of that
5319100	5320780	extra added content on there.
5320780	5323500	You were right.
5323500	5327100	That's apparently going to be their finale.
5327100	5333020	And then, there's supposed to be a top secret exclusive Xbox 360 tile that nobody outside
5333020	5335900	of Konami has been told what this is.
5337420	5339500	Yet, this guy knows what it is.
5341500	5346140	But, I have a feeling that that might be the new Castlevania game, since they haven't
5346140	5348220	really shown much of that.
5348220	5348720	Ooh!
5349580	5350380	That's right!
5350380	5353340	We haven't had one on the new Next Gen series, have we?
5353340	5354620	They had a little preview video.
5355260	5355980	That's right!
5355980	5358620	It was like two seconds of nothing.
5358620	5359100	Yeah.
5359100	5359740	Interesting.
5359740	5360060	Okay.
5360060	5360860	So there might be that.
5361420	5367900	The second Grand Theft Auto 4 download content was supposed to be announced and being subtitled
5367900	5376540	Blood and a Four Leaf Clover, which may follow the other character that was in the game,
5376540	5382700	Packey, and his brothers as they try to pull off a bank heist or something like that, because
5382700	5383500	that was in the game.
5384620	5385180	Interesting.
5386540	5393820	The new Peter Milano project, codenamed Richter, is supposed to be shown.
5393820	5399260	They're going to show some stuff about Forza 3, that's going to be playable.
5399260	5406700	Alan Wake is going to be there, as well as APB, which is going to be announced, available
5406700	5411580	for the Xbox 360, I'm assuming, unless they're going to be covering games for Windows there.
5412700	5417340	Splinter Cell Conviction will be on hand, Lost Planet 2, Assassin's Creed 2, Bioshock
5417340	5422140	2, Halo 3 ODST, which is not surprising.
5422140	5431100	And then, I think that was it, but it's interesting because of course Microsoft responded back
5431100	5436700	with, no that's not even close to what we have, but I guess we'll have to see if that's
5436700	5441180	actually, I mean some of this stuff could be educated guesses, I mean everyone's assuming
5441180	5444380	that Alan Wake will be there, obviously they're going to have the new Grand Theft Auto download
5444380	5446860	content since it's due out in the fall.
5446860	5449340	But seriously, Blood and a Four Leaf Clover?
5449340	5453260	Like, that's a very interesting title for a game.
5453260	5459340	Yeah, it is interesting, although it doesn't really fit with what everyone was thinking
5459340	5464140	the next game's going to be, because basically there's a mission where you have this drug
5464140	5466140	deal and there's three people involved.
5466140	5471900	The first one being Nico from the first game, the second one being Johnny from the second
5472540	5476860	download content, and then the third one is some other guy who they're thinking is going
5476860	5481740	to be the third download content, and it's all supposed to merge on that one mission.
5481740	5485740	But, I don't know, we'll see I guess what happens there.
5486940	5493820	Interesting nonetheless though, and Rockstar did say that they are going to announce the
5493820	5497420	next download content, so I mean we kind of figured that was going to happen anyways,
5497420	5500700	but they didn't confirm that that's the subtitle that they had.
5500700	5508700	So, and then the guys behind APB said yes, they will be at E3 with a big announcement.
5508700	5512540	So, a lot of stuff just hints at that, but see then again you can take all those hints
5512540	5513980	and kind of come up with educated guess.
5514860	5518460	I don't know, but the point is, you know, why fake, you know, these announcements or
5518460	5519660	something other, I don't know.
5520460	5521900	Well, I think some of it holds weight.
5521900	5523420	I think the fluid thing is going to happen.
5523420	5524940	I think we all know that...
5524940	5527420	It may not be called the fluid, but you know, it might be something.
5527420	5531820	Yeah, I think that's a pretty likely name actually, all things considered.
5531820	5535580	That's, you know, it makes sense, especially if the whole thing is about motion and it
5535580	5538860	sees everything in little subtle movements and all that.
5538860	5542300	I bet anything that fluid is a very possible name for this.
5542300	5544060	Yeah, but we'll see.
5544060	5548780	actdeft in chat very plainly says MGS4 on 360 ain't happening.
5549340	5552860	And lazy days follows that up with because Kojima's done.
5552860	5556300	That is a hard one to believe, but what about now Metal Gear Solid 5?
5556300	5559580	I don't think they would necessarily have a trailer or anything, but what about an announcement?
5560300	5562060	I don't think it's going to be Metal Gear Solid 4.
5562060	5566220	I don't think that's going to come to the 360 because, you know, the amount of data
5566220	5570220	that's on there, unless they went back and found a way to compress all that down and
5570220	5571260	stuff like that.
5571260	5575180	Or if they have a way that you can now with installations and stuff like that, you can
5575180	5577340	just install all the disks to your hard drive.
5577340	5581900	And really, I mean, when you think about it, you know, either waiting, you know, five minutes
5581900	5586940	to install a game or I don't know, making this swap that one time.
5586940	5587500	Oh my God.
5587500	5589100	It takes like two seconds.
5589100	5590300	Is it such a big deal?
5590300	5592620	I don't think so, but who knows?
5593980	5594380	All right.
5594380	5598780	Well, it'll be interesting to see if this actually holds weight at E3 because if it
5598780	5603580	does, then this whole little Twitter source is going to be huge in the future.
5603580	5603900	Watch.
5603900	5607260	They'll blow up to 60,000 followers if it's the case.
5607260	5610300	Press conference is supposed to be June 1st, 9 a.m.
5610300	5615420	Tora in chat says, I would gladly disk swap to play Metal Gear Solid 4.
5615420	5617900	I wish I could be there for the Microsoft conference, but I'm going to be getting into
5617900	5619180	town on June 1st.
5619180	5621580	I might get to go to Sony's.
5621580	5622380	Might.
5622380	5624060	I'm watching both.
5624060	5627340	I'm not going to go because I'm not going to even be there.
5627340	5628300	It's going to be tough.
5628300	5632060	Anyhow, let's move on and go into Rock Band Unplugged.
5632060	5635820	Of course, as Loki mentioned a little bit ago, he's got to take a sneak peek at it.
5635820	5638860	And a lot of people have been taking a sneak peek at the game because the track list is
5638860	5639500	at the internet.
5639500	5643500	This game, by the way, is coming out June 9th, 2009, which is right around the corner
5643500	5644380	from E3 week.
5644380	5646940	That's all that's hit the internet.
5646940	5649260	Yeah, well, I bet a lot of folks have already been getting it.
5649260	5653660	But if you are being a good boy or a good girl and waiting until its actual release
5653660	5655820	day, some of the things you have to look forward to.
5655820	5659180	I'm just going to read you some of the songs that are exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged,
5659180	5660460	at least for a little while.
5660460	5662220	They do emphasize for a limited time.
5662780	5667980	AFI, Miss Murder, Audioslave, Gasoline, Black Tide, Show Me The Way, Freeze Pop, Let's
5667980	5668700	Talk More Rock.
5668700	5671740	Now, see, I thought that song was in Rock Band.
5671740	5672700	I thought it was in Rock Band.
5672700	5676140	I thought it was too, but they're not only an exclusive game, maybe because it was download
5676140	5676540	content.
5676540	5676860	I don't know.
5677500	5682380	Three Doors Down, Kryptonite, Alice in Chains, Wood, Blink-182, What's My Age Again.
5682380	5685100	Again, wasn't that download content or am I mixing it up with Dammit?
5685100	5685580	I don't know.
5688940	5691660	Tora in chat says it's Guitar Hero.
5691660	5692620	It's a Guitar Hero song.
5693420	5696060	That's why they're marking it as an exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged.
5696060	5701180	1970s brings us ABC by The Jackson 5.
5701180	5703180	That's the other big exclusive song.
5703180	5707100	The rest of them are all songs you might recognize from the game already, like some of the ones
5707100	5708300	I personally like.
5708300	5710140	Float On by Modest Mouse.
5710140	5710940	That's pretty cool.
5712140	5717820	Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Today, Smashing Pumpkins, I Was Wrong, Social Distortion,
5717820	5719180	Weezer, Buddy Holly.
5719180	5720300	It'll be fun.
5720300	5721420	White Wedding, Billy Idol.
5721420	5722620	You gotta have some Billy Idol.
5722620	5726700	Susie and the Banshees, yes, Killing Jar, pretty decent song list.
5726700	5729180	I don't know, but Loki seems to maybe disagree.
5729180	5729980	It's okay.
5729980	5735260	It's something I'd play off and on, but you know, it's not a game I could really get into
5735820	5741580	like the normal rock band, unless they have, you know, a more variety of download content,
5741580	5744700	like, you know, some pop songs and that kind of stuff.
5744700	5749260	Because this, they could do that, but are they?
5749260	5753500	I mean, ABC, that's definitely Poppy, so we'll see.
5754060	5757580	Well, don't we have Lego Rock Band to come fill in the pop void?
5757580	5759260	That's true, but that's another game.
5759260	5760380	That's not this game.
5760380	5766220	Lego Rock Band, I am very interested in picking up just, well, after I see the soundtrack,
5766220	5768060	but I don't know.
5768060	5772220	Well, speaking of download content, there's going to be download stuff available right
5772220	5776060	off the bat for this game, and some of the songs have already been announced there.
5776060	5779260	Now, some of it overlaps with what you can already download.
5780140	5781900	Actually, I think all of it does.
5781900	5786780	Muse with Hysteria, No Doubt, Just a Girl, Paramore, Crush Crush Crush, Red Hot Chili
5786780	5787820	Peppers Under the Bridge.
5787820	5791180	Some of the, I think all of these songs are already available on regular rock band, but
5791180	5792540	if you want to pay for it again, you can.
5793580	5799100	I wish I could get the songs that I have on my rock band over, but I know that's not going
5799100	5799500	to happen.
5800220	5800620	Why not?
5800620	5801580	They'll charge me twice.
5802620	5805900	By the way, the chat room always filling in the void when we don't know things right off
5805900	5810540	the bat, off the top of our head, which, you know, hey, look, we know a lot about video
5810540	5813260	games, but we don't have the brain capacity to know everything about video games.
5813260	5816380	That's why the chat room really helps us out every week.
5816380	5819900	Act Def says the only Blink 182 songs are Dammit and All the Small Things.
5819900	5822140	So I guess What's My Age Again actually isn't in there.
5822140	5825180	Maybe I'm getting it mixed up with Sing Star, because I have too many music games at home.
5825180	5825680	I don't know.
5826540	5827180	So there you go.
5829900	5832860	Death Wishing calls Lego rock band Lego Fail Band.
5832860	5833340	We'll see.
5833900	5835260	Game's got a little while before it comes out.
5835260	5836620	Does it get hit with the fail pail?
5837260	5837900	Hopefully not.
5839260	5839820	That's my hope.
5840620	5843340	Well, here's something that may or may not be fail.
5843340	5844140	It just depends.
5845820	5849500	There's a splash page for a particular game showing up on Xbox.com.
5851180	5855260	But I'm pretty sure that splash page means actual release.
5855260	5859740	So that'd be Wolfenstein 3D on Xbox Live.
5859740	5863660	And I kind of hope that it's given the HD treatment.
5863660	5867020	But do you really want to shoot HD red-eyed Hitler in the face?
5867020	5868940	I don't think it's going to be having the HD treatment.
5868940	5872620	And it makes sense with a new Wolfenstein game coming out in a few months.
5872620	5873020	That's true.
5873020	5876700	But I think it'd be nice to give it the HD treatment.
5878380	5879100	It'd be cool.
5879100	5879980	I don't think it's going to be cool.
5879980	5881100	Cool, but not bloody likely.
5881100	5882700	Yeah, not likely.
5882700	5885500	I mean, they didn't really do that with Doom or Duke Nukem.
5885500	5887260	So I don't think they're going to start now.
5887900	5888460	It'd be kind of...
5888460	5890060	It'd look weird anyways if he did that.
5890060	5892220	It'd kind of take away from the cheapness.
5892220	5894940	Now what they needed to have is Rise of the Triad on there.
5894940	5895820	Because that'd be sweet.
5897340	5898540	Yes, a lot better than...
5899660	5901900	Actually, it would be kind of cool with Wolfenstein if they did it.
5901900	5903340	It was like co-op or something like that.
5903340	5904380	That'd be kind of cool too.
5904380	5906300	But they're definitely not going to do that either.
5908460	5911500	Well, there's a couple stories I have here about GameTap.
5911500	5917180	Including, they're going to start featuring some of the Microsoft Game Studios stuff.
5917180	5923660	Including Age of Mythology, Age of Empires II, Fable, The Lost Chapter, Freelancer,
5923660	5928700	MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, Rise of the Nation, and Zoo Tycoon.
5929420	5938860	And apparently right now, the US and Europe have...
5940700	5945580	Europe is getting Fable, The Lost Chapter, and MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, and Zoo Tycoon.
5945580	5952220	And then also, I guess, US is getting Age of Empires II and Fable right now.
5952220	5954460	And the rest are going to roll out slowly later.
5954460	5955820	Which is kind of neat.
5956380	5962860	And then also, GameTap has apparently the rights right now for Panzer Dragoon Saga.
5963660	5964380	Sweet!
5964380	5967980	However, they're running into some emulation complexities.
5967980	5971740	And haven't been able to release it yet.
5971740	5976220	But can I say one other thing about my gaming week, since you brought it up?
5976220	5977740	I tried to get back into GameTap.
5977740	5983100	I haven't played GameTap since they switched from their little front-end program they used
5983100	5984780	to browser integrated.
5984780	5987020	And might I say, I hate it.
5987020	5988780	I hate the new GameTap.
5988780	5992140	Like, it took me forever to get it to figure out how to work.
5992140	5994140	Like, the old one was so much better.
5994140	5995820	Why did they make it worse?
5995820	5999340	I guess they were acquired by this new company or whatever, but I don't like it.
5999340	6003260	Now it feels like I'm going on to, like, a cheap Games.Yahoo site or playing things.
6003260	6005660	Like, you know, right there in the browser window and all that stuff.
6005660	6006860	I don't like it at all.
6006860	6008700	Like, it seems like what they had before was just fine.
6009340	6009980	I don't know.
6009980	6011740	You know I used to be a huge GameTap fan.
6011740	6013660	In fact, people thought I was on their payroll and stuff.
6013660	6016220	I do not like these changes they've been making lately.
6016220	6020380	And it kind of, I'm still irritated at the fact that nothing runs in Windows Vista.
6020380	6023500	This didn't used to bug me because I didn't always use Windows Vista.
6023500	6025820	But, you know, I understand emulation, blah, blah, blah.
6025820	6026700	Not everything's possible.
6026700	6028460	But it's just, ugh, it's annoying.
6028460	6030700	Well, also, the whole Panzer Dragon thing.
6030700	6034380	They're all, the complexity of the Saturn emulation is what's holding it back.
6035180	6038860	I have a perfectly functioning Saturn emulator already, you know.
6038860	6040860	So it can be done.
6040860	6043820	And they're all, well, we're not sure if enough people want this game.
6043820	6048460	So, you know, if we get enough people wanting it, then we'll spend the large
6048460	6050780	development time that's going to take to do this.
6052620	6055180	Rama in chat says, run it under XP compatibility.
6055180	6056060	Does it work?
6056060	6057660	Look at GameTap's own FAQs.
6057660	6058220	It'll tell you.
6058220	6058700	It doesn't work.
6059980	6062860	I tried that when it was still on the front end system because I can't play Civ 4,
6062860	6064300	which kind of makes me mad.
6064300	6064780	I don't know.
6064780	6069820	I just, I see the value of GameTap kind of going down, not up.
6069820	6072780	And that's what kind of, you know, I still think it's an all right value.
6072780	6074780	You know, you do get a lot of freaking games.
6074780	6075900	And at least you're paying for it.
6075900	6079340	So you have that whole good karma thing going on instead of just being a maim
6079340	6080700	whore with all the ROMs.
6080700	6082060	And there's some decent stuff on there.
6082060	6083740	But damn, they've got some work to do.
6083740	6085900	And I hate the new front end compared to the old one.
6086780	6087500	I don't know.
6087500	6090540	It's, I was kind of dumb and bought a whole year in advance, but whatever.
6092460	6093980	They got you hooked and then changed it.
6093980	6095420	I get, yeah, exactly.
6095420	6098620	That's what I feel like exactly is what it is, is that they got me hooked on
6098620	6099660	something that was pretty awesome.
6099660	6101180	And then the rug got pulled out from under me.
6101180	6102620	I do not like the browser setup.
6103420	6103740	Blah.
6104620	6109900	Anyhow, one thing I might like a little more than the new GameTap is the slim
6109900	6111260	PlayStation 3.
6111260	6113580	That is if rumors are to be believed.
6113580	6117020	Uh, apparently there are pictures floating around on the blogs this week
6117020	6119260	of a PlayStation 3 slim.
6120060	6123340	Apparently what will happen on this PlayStation 3 slim is that instead of
6123340	6126380	that whole, like, uh, kind of shiny black look, it'll look a little more
6126380	6128060	like a PlayStation 2.
6128060	6132860	And, uh, apparently now, instead of having a Spider-Man looking logo, it'll
6132860	6135020	kind of look just like a PlayStation 2.
6135020	6135900	Uh, who knows?
6135900	6138620	Maybe this is just a Photoshop PlayStation 2 box.
6138620	6139420	But, uh, who knows?
6139420	6140300	It is rumors.
6140300	6143100	They actually have pictures of the actual diecast step too.
6143100	6143740	Do they really?
6144300	6145580	I mean, I don't know.
6145580	6147980	It might be a prototype, but then again, they have a box.
6147980	6148540	So I don't know.
6148540	6150940	I, I'm a little iffy on this.
6150940	6153580	It's still, doesn't it still seem a little soon?
6153580	6156620	Well, not necessarily because if you think about it, remember when we had a
6156620	6160940	rumor like this for the Xbox 360, that it was getting a built-in HDMI port.
6160940	6164540	And sure enough, those pictures leaked out of like the motherboard and
6164540	6166540	everything with the HDMI port in it.
6166540	6169660	And then we got the systems with the HDMI ports now.
6169660	6172540	So I'm not surprised this is going to eventually happen.
6172540	6174460	And maybe it's happening right now.
6174460	6177420	Maybe they think this redesigns what's going to get people to buy it.
6177420	6180140	I think they're stupid because it's just like the same, you know, Oh,
6180140	6181900	let's take out the backwards compatibility.
6181900	6182700	Oh, let's.
6182700	6184780	Now take out some of those USB ports.
6184780	6186380	Oh, let's do this.
6186380	6188300	Put the backwards compatibility back in.
6188300	6189980	Maybe you'll now you'll be talking.
6189980	6190860	But who knows?
6190860	6193260	I mean, if they're going to, I don't know, but maybe this is why they keep
6193260	6193980	swearing up and down.
6193980	6196300	There's not going to be a price drop because there's just going to be
6196300	6197740	a new system instead.
6197740	6198300	Who knows?
6198300	6200700	I don't know if they had the backwards compatibility backyard and
6200700	6204060	people are going to get pissed, but then again there are some stupid people out there that will buy
6204060	6209180	another system for this, but I don't understand why you can just buy a Playstation 2.
6209180	6212420	Maybe that's what they're hoping. People are just going to get fed up and buy another
6212420	6215700	Playstation 2 or something. I don't know.
6215700	6222420	Well, there you go. That's it. Sony is supposedly releasing a slim Playstation 3.
6222420	6227460	We will see more at possibly E3 this week. But you know what? I don't know about you guys,
6227460	6231580	but all these rumors running around left and right, it seems like anybody can come up with
6231580	6235180	a rumor in this day and age. And not being able to sort all this shit out makes me a
6235180	6238940	little angsty. Do you know what happens when we get angsty?
6238940	6241940	People die. That, and there's a nephews of the week segment.
6241940	6270700	My nephew is going to go to finals sapping my brain, my strength, my willpower, and any
6270700	6279460	ounce of energy I could possibly have. I just want to pass, and I want to take a break.
6279460	6286340	My nephew uses a stool, it's hurting my butt. At least it's not the other kind of stool.
6286340	6290180	Yes, that is true. Do you have a hard stool?
6290180	6298140	I do have a hard stool right now. Ew, you should put that on Twitter.
6298140	6302700	Let's see, my nephew of the week goes to, I don't really have a lot. You know what?
6302700	6306620	Things are actually going pretty good in my life right now. I can't complain. Chicago
6306620	6308220	was fun. Make up something.
6308220	6311860	No, I do have one. But I just want to say, you know what? All things are actually pretty
6311860	6317000	good except, a few to my broken air conditioner. Because living in a house with no air conditioner
6317000	6323460	in 100 degree weather sucks. So a few to that. But thank you to people like Jamie who let
6323460	6327740	me come over and sit in their air conditioned house all night.
6327740	6330780	Actually, now that it's gotten cooler outside, this room is a lot more comfortable.
6330780	6336460	Yeah, it's nice now. So there you go. But yeah, not having an air conditioning really
6336460	6343360	sucks. Anyway, what sucks a little less is your emails. You email us every week at mailbag
6343360	6347820	at orangelaundry.com and DarkSakura dives head first in the email bag and read some
6347820	6352480	of your emails. And yes, we're also going to be giving away a signed autographed copy
6352480	6359140	of Smile DK signing Supernova. We did have people get all five right. I'll tell you right
6359140	6364100	off the bat, if you didn't get all five right, sorry, you didn't win. Play again next time.
6364100	6367100	But we did have several people that got all five and we're going to be telling you who
6367100	6371700	won right after the email bag segment.
6371700	6378740	DarkSakura, who's sending some email to mailbag this week?
6378740	6387700	The first one is from, let's see, Taz. Hey there, this is my first email to the OLR mailbag
6387700	6393180	and I want to suggest a retro game if it hasn't already been on the show already. Redundant.
6393180	6399780	The game is Live Alive, an RPG from Squaresoft for the Super Famicom. I know about this game.
6399780	6403420	It was not released outside of Japan, but some unofficial translations are out there
6403420	6410740	in the net. The real title is sort of a mirror image of Live Alive as with the other lives
6410740	6416260	spelled backwards where you see evil in the second half rather than live. I thought this
6416260	6420100	game had one of the most original ideas for a game to date. You select one of seven playable
6420100	6424060	characters and each character belongs to a different time period and has his or her own
6424060	6430140	story for the story play like a complete, all stories play like a complete, a completely
6430140	6433700	different RPG and they're short and easy to learn. For example, the caveman stories about
6433700	6438340	a caveman saving his love because they haven't invented the language. There are no text box
6438340	6444180	speeches in the story, but they communicate with figures in dialogue bubbles. Hilarity
6444180	6449660	ensues. Some of the stories have a much darker tone as others may make you cry. I'm sorry,
6449660	6452940	and others may make you cry. I really enjoyed the story for the robot in the future, which
6452940	6457980	plays like a survival horror. I suggest anyone who likes retro RPGs pick up this title. I'm
6457980	6463140	sure Square won't mind any more about the translated ROM. It'd be awesome if they add
6463140	6468100	this game to a virtual console. I'd buy it. P.S. My also favorite RPG is Secret of Mana
6468100	6473500	followed by Xenogears and Chrono Trigger. All are must plays. I'll give it a download.
6473500	6480480	If I have time, I'll give it a download. So sure. Yeah, I've not heard of this game ever,
6480480	6485460	but it sounds very interesting. So that's all I got. I like listener submitted classic
6485460	6488780	games of the week. They know more obscure shit than we do sometimes. I know of this
6488780	6492980	game. Do you really? Yes. I've never heard of it. In fact, I think I know someone who
6492980	6506340	owns it. Wow. Um, oh, yeah, this is, never mind. Um, this is from, uh, FrozenRay? I really
6506340	6512760	don't like it. Oh, GS68, sorry. Um, hey Jamie, hey Loki, hey Robrobrob. So by the time you're
6512760	6517220	reading this, your business at ASIN is done. I hope that went well. You've been hyping
6517220	6520780	that up, but no mention of Faname, which has led me to believe you're not going this year,
6520780	6525160	most likely subsequent years, which means, once again, I'll be the only active OLR listener
6525160	6530100	at Faname. Since I'm rather sure OLR at Faname is not going to happen, I'm going to make
6530100	6534780	a bet, if you do go to Faname after all, I will make myself cosplay as Rei Ayanami, oh
6534780	6539860	my god, don't, at Faname 2010, and that means the whole universe is going to die. Yes, they
6539860	6544580	will. I'll also consider a scheme to get Eye of Judgment to sell a million copies by May
6544580	6550260	2010, so Loki also has to cosplay a tingle at the con. It's never going to happen because
6550260	6557540	I think they've stopped making it, so, it's done. It's done. If you don't go to Faname,
6557540	6563260	then I hope to see Dark Sakura, um, and maybe, maybe Rob at California Extreme this July
6563260	6569340	is possible. That is more likely than Faname. I do want to confirm, just, uh, we did not
6569340	6574380	make plans to attend Faname this year, nothing against Faname, it's a lovely con, but just
6574380	6579260	so much other stuff going on. I'm actually trying to save up money to go to Las Vegas
6579260	6583820	in July. For me, I had stuff going on with, um, you guys know I do some theater stuff
6583820	6587820	on the weekends, and I just had a conflict, so, um, I couldn't do it. But I hope those
6587820	6593460	of you guys that are going have a lot of fun. Less than 3 GS68 PS, this email is brought
6593460	6598260	to you by the South Bay Home of the Never Ending Overcast Weather. However, California
6598260	6602060	Extreme I have never been and I really want to go, and this is my year of going to things
6602060	6606980	I haven't done before. It's fun. I know, so, I went to ASEN, I've, how many years did it
6606980	6612060	take for me to finally get there, like 4 years? So, uh, maybe I'll do California Extreme finally.
6612060	6615660	Well, I hope you don't have, you know, my experience of, you know, waiting 3 years to
6615660	6620060	do something and then it finally sucking when you do it. What was that? Tower of Terror.
6620060	6626500	Oh, hey, I love Tower of Terror. It, it freaked me the hell out. I can't do it ever again.
6626500	6631500	Aww, it's fun. I heart it. I'm actually trying to go to Disneyland 1-3. I've been in an elevator
6631500	6637660	when it fell 2 stories. I know, that can't be fun. And you know what? Mmm. Marissa was
6637660	6642100	saying that it's the first part that scares you, that the whole story part was the scary
6642100	6646180	part and the psyching you up. Oh no, the drop is the scariest part. Oh no. The lead up was
6646180	6651360	fun. I loved all that. But the dropping, I was like, yeah, I remember this feeling, only
6651360	6657740	this is worse because it's pushing you. So yeah. I want to say, chat real quick, chat.orensonshortory.com.
6657740	6661220	Tora says, it was fun meeting Rob at ASEN. Thank you, it was fun meeting you too. Though
6661220	6664900	he looked kind of out of it on Saturday. Yeah, again, did you hear the part about 9 people
6664900	6669920	in the hotel room? That was the cocaine. Shut up. Cocaine's a hell of a drug. And then somebody
6669920	6675100	who didn't change their name, their recruit number 3972 says, what about Comic Con? I
6675100	6679820	would love to go to Comic Con and Miss Victoria has been begging me. I don't know if you remember
6679820	6683220	her. She was on the show a while ago when Jamie was out one week. She'd been begging
6683220	6686860	me to go to Comic Con, but this year it's not going to happen because we're going to
6686860	6691220	see no doubt the same weekend. I want to go to Comic Con just to, you know, harass my
6691220	6695100	favorite Marvel people if they're there. I want to go one year because you run into celebrities
6695100	6699780	all the time there and I'm dying to meet Zachary Quinto because he's dreamy. But anyway, maybe
6699780	6705460	next year. This email, dun dun dun. Hi, OLR crew. I just wanted to say after your last
6705460	6708100	show, my girlfriend and I went to Safeway and bought three pounds of bacon for eight
6708100	6713500	bucks and made bacon and pancakes for her mother on Mother's Day. It was very delicious
6713500	6716620	and it was even more delicious knowing I was helping save Americans from idiots who think
6716620	6720980	swine flu comes from cooked pork meat. You, sir, are American of the week. Thank you very
6720980	6728700	much. Round of applause, please. Who is this emailer? AZHP. AZHP. You, sir. I'm actually
6728700	6732700	a model citizen. I've actually been trying to think of my next big thing that I'm going
6732700	6736360	to do. And because, you know, it is the summer and, you know, ice cream stuff, we had this
6736360	6741160	where we do these questions of the week type thing and they're all what custom ice cream
6741160	6745260	flavor would you want? And no, not baking, because that's I mean, seriously, that tastes
6745260	6749180	like crap. I mean, you just can't. So I don't know. I don't know. Something baking cannot
6749180	6754100	make sense. I'm buying it up, but candies, bacon, ice cream, ice cream recipe. No, that's
6754100	6762700	not good. But I thought of a waffle breakfast ice cream. Follow me. Oh, my God. This sounds
6762700	6769380	amazing. Follow me with this. Waffle ice cream? You have waffle ice cream comb bits in there
6769380	6775120	mixed in there, maple syrup, vanilla ice cream. And because you have to and I know this probably
6775120	6779860	would not be good, but a little bit of butter dripped in there, you know, just because you
6779860	6783460	need that butter flavor. Otherwise, you might be able to mix it with the maple syrup. Oh,
6783460	6789660	I thought about waffle ice cream and I jizzed in my pants. Wow. Oh, I see it's the alcohol
6789660	6793220	in here that makes us good. But I wonder if like if I brought like maple syrup and butter
6793220	6798060	to like a cold stone or something like that, they could do that. Candied bacon ice cream.
6798060	6805220	Hitstun in chat says this is why you're fat. Because I think of stuff. How rude. Oh, he
6805220	6811620	followed it up with dot com. There is a website called this is why you're fat dot com. It's
6811620	6819020	great. I'm also posting. It's dot com. That on my own Twitter, the candied bacon ice cream.
6819020	6824140	There you go. All right. More emails. Sorry, we got to finish our all American email. Yes.
6824140	6829420	P.S. Oh, no, there's more. Also, Dark Soccer mentioned on a podcast a few weeks that she
6829420	6833700	enjoyed the Toy Story ride very much. I rode this ride back in July after a trip to Anime
6833700	6837620	Expo and I thought it was awesome as well. I don't know if it will make your show roll
6837620	6842700	this week, but the game is slated to be released on the Wii in some form soon. I didn't know
6842700	6847980	that. I have heard this. I have heard this and I have a friend who loves Disney and is
6847980	6851100	going to be probably buying a Wii just to this day. The video is on the Internet already.
6851100	6855540	Oh, my gosh. I want to I hear it's going to have 3D glasses. I was actually I was actually
6855540	6862100	too stunned by another Wii release that I'll be covering later in the show to think about
6862100	6865860	that. Everyone I'm looking forward to this game is I love the ride, but the line was
6865860	6871000	atrocious. That's why you go right before park closes. No line. You get in the line
6871000	6876220	and they close off the line. Anyway, love AZHP. P.S. I typed this all up on my palm
6876220	6880220	tree or cell phone just to prove that you can write a grammatically correct email without
6880220	6888740	the presence of a full keyboard. This is as I look it up. Yes, very well done. You're
6888740	6894420	due to be commended. All American with good grammar. You're just like the citizen of the
6894420	6900740	week. Honestly, you win a shiny gold star. There you go. Last email. Can we can we have
6900740	6905380	like maybe a wiki page gold star email recipients? Yeah. I mean, we should have something where
6905380	6912220	someone make it like a special club for people who send just a plus quality emails and AZHP
6912220	6919100	is the first inductee. Yes. Someone make it. I mean, my God. Bacon, grammar, everything
6919100	6929060	all in one. You make it. I choose you. There you go. Okay. Last email. This is from Clone
6929060	6938140	627. Hi, O.L.R. I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game against what game?
6938140	6942180	I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game has been that it's too soon. But
6942180	6947780	oh, didn't Army of Two start with the September 11th attack? So it's too soon for mutual war,
6947780	6951940	but not too soon for terrorist attack that killed tons of civilians. Just a thought.
6951940	6955940	And I apologize if any spelling or grammar problems. My power is out and I'm typing this
6955940	6962140	on the iPhone. Sorry, you've just been owned by AZHP. Just letting you know that you've
6962140	6966900	been you've been owned. Grammar has two A's. This must be about six days in Fallujah. I
6966900	6970860	don't really think it's been two. I mean, I don't really care to be honest, you know,
6970860	6975220	with how soon it was. I think we were just saying this too soon. That's probably why
6975220	6981220	they pulled it. You know, honestly, I wouldn't play it anyways, because it's it doesn't look
6981220	6988100	good. I mean, it might be good if you want to play that type of thing. But I don't know.
6988100	6992180	We don't know Konami for you. They're epic war games.
6992180	6997860	Do you remember how Manhunt 2, that game kind of generated all this controversy? It was
6997860	7002420	like every week we had some goddamn story about Manhunt 2 and what country banned it
7002420	7009140	this week. And then the game came out and it sucked. Yeah, I'm kind of reminded of that.
7009140	7013220	You know, it's hard to say. I can't judge it till I play it. Six Days of Fallujah is
7013220	7018420	not my type of game anyway. But I'm just saying, just because the game's always getting that
7018420	7021620	buzz doesn't mean it's going to be worth it. Just saying.
7021620	7024380	Well, I lied. There's one more email. It's a doozy.
7024380	7025380	All righty.
7025380	7031940	Hey, y'all. I had to say it the right way, you know. First of all, thank you, Rob, for
7031940	7035940	getting the last podcast up in an expedient manner. I look forward to this being a trend
7035940	7038340	and not an isolated occurrence. Thanks again.
7038340	7040100	Well, look at you, Mr. Big Words.
7040100	7042660	What if it's a Ms. Big Words?
7042660	7043660	Fair enough. You're in the way.
7043660	7044660	It actually is a Mr. Big Words.
7044660	7045660	All right.
7045660	7050260	Loki, congrats on the twins and thank you for your statement of not wanting to name
7050260	7053860	your children after characters that populate one of your hobbies. I have-
7053860	7054860	Yet.
7054860	7055860	I have-
7055860	7058260	It ain't over till it's over.
7058260	7063060	Let me read. I have an uncle, a wrestling fan, who named his kids Austin and Hunter
7063060	7067660	and he never hears the end of it. I know who he named him after, too, which is sad. Steve
7067660	7069380	Austin and Triple H.
7069380	7075060	Oh, my God. Yeah, not doing that.
7075060	7079820	I'm sure that if you act in the way that my uncle did, the ribbing will be exponentially
7079820	7084260	worse. After all, there are lots of jackasses online, including this ginger kid who thinks
7084260	7089660	he writes a hilarious blog. And, Jamie, let me join you in your assessment of Silent Hill
7089660	7093700	3, although I did have to stop playing it near the end after getting overloaded with
7093700	7097660	the imagery in the game. Oh, God. Hell, yes. Silent Hill 3 stands as one of my favorite
7097660	7103060	PlayStation 2 games. I only hope that when I get around to playing Silent Hill Homecoming,
7103060	7107180	it is fractionally as good as Silent Hill 3 and I'm gonna be starting that soon. I've
7107180	7110180	got your copy still, Rob.
7110180	7111180	Fun.
7111180	7115780	Now, while I'm really emailing you, I didn't just message you to kiss your ass. I appreciate
7115780	7116780	ass kissing, by the way.
7116780	7119800	I know. You could have just kissed our ass and left it at that. We don't mind.
7119800	7123780	I noticed something while I was playing Mirrors Edge recently. The first day I played it,
7123780	7126860	I was getting into the game and looked forward to playing it more. The second day, I played
7126860	7131660	it and enjoyed it more and more. What's the difference between the gaming sessions? Music.
7131660	7135140	The first day, I listened to the in-game music, but the second day, I was listening to music
7135140	7141580	for my iPod, specifically Nine Inch Nails. I attribute this fact to... I attribute this
7141580	7147980	fact to my enhanced... I think you meant enhanced and not enhanced enjoyment, especially since
7147980	7154540	I spent the third day I was listening to Dresden Dolls and achieved a similar level of enjoyment.
7154540	7158700	As I thought back along my history of playing games, I see my music being an integral part
7158700	7162660	of my enjoyment. Whether it's listening to Social Distortion while playing Left 4 Dead,
7162660	7167760	Cake, Beck, and Seal while playing Tiger Woods PGA, or Core Metallica and Rammstein while
7167760	7173020	playing Final Fantasy VIII, the occasional monotony of playing games was eliminated from
7173020	7176620	me by listening to the music that I love. It makes me wonder how many of us have felt
7176620	7181140	the same effect. That is the kind of question I pose to you three. I think it might be interesting
7181140	7184940	to hear the kinds of music you mix with the kinds of games that you play. Actually, just
7184940	7191180	to say, I usually prefer the in-game music because I think that the games were... I...
7191180	7198180	This is from being a musician myself. And actually being a person who is actually getting
7199260	7206260	very much into experience and the identity of something, you know, has really been more
7206260	7211100	recent transformation. But I think that the music is actually an integral part to the
7211100	7216260	game. It's part of what defines the action, part of what ties everything in together.
7216260	7220620	And yeah, a crap soundtrack can break a game, but it's still part of the experience, you
7220620	7227620	know. So in that respect, I prefer to try it at least a few times through with the original
7227860	7232900	music. And then if I've played it for a while, then I might try to find something else. You
7232900	7238100	know what I mean? Yeah, I rarely use custom soundtracks. As cool as they are, I rarely
7238100	7241740	use them, I find, actually. They're for racing games. That's just what I was going to get
7241740	7246180	into. It's a Ridge Racer game. Racing games, I always seem to use custom soundtracks with.
7246180	7250660	And I like to do like driving type of techno, like, you know, boo boo boo boo boo boo. Just
7250660	7255000	throw in the Won Gun CDs. It was serious. Actually, I've done that. I love playing
7255000	7259340	Burnout with the Won Gun music. It's pretty fun. But here's a curveball for you. One thing
7259340	7264580	I like to do, World of Warcraft, obviously, you know I play that game. And you know, even
7264580	7268060	though I agree pretty much with what Jamie said, the soundtrack to World of Warcraft
7268060	7272100	gets a little old. You've kind of heard all the same songs over and over and over again.
7272100	7276280	I like to listen to talk radio while I play World of Warcraft. There's a particular political
7276280	7280340	talk show I listen to in the evenings. I like to listen to that and play World of Warcraft.
7280340	7283900	And what I do is I have the talk show play through my headphones, and then I have WoW
7283900	7287260	playing through my speakers, so I can kind of hear both, but I'm not being distracted
7287260	7291860	by the game noises. That's actually kind of the way I've been gaming lately, like that.
7291860	7295980	But rarely, yeah, for the same reasons, especially with a lot of games coming out right now that
7295980	7299740	have the very driving soundtracks like Space Invaders Xtreme and things like that that have
7299740	7305740	the thumpin' soundtracks. I don't really like to switch it out.
7305740	7312540	Yeah, sorry. If anyone picked that up, Rob's using my stylus as a mouse.
7312540	7318780	It's fine. Now I'm fidgeting with it, even though it's super expensive. But yes. Anyway,
7318780	7322980	that's pretty much my answer to the question, is that I do talk radio, if anything else.
7322980	7328940	Well, there are some games that, just after having played them for a long time, I will
7328940	7332740	listen to other stuff, but really it has to be something that I've played for a long time.
7332740	7337720	Or actually, I'll do it when I play RO, because after a while, the music in-game really freakin'
7337720	7338720	gets on my nerves.
7338720	7341940	Yeah, I mean, a lot of MMOs, I'm sure, are like that, you know, just even if it's...
7341940	7344780	But I didn't do it for other games. I didn't do it for World of Warcraft, and I didn't
7344780	7346660	do it for Final Fantasy XI.
7346660	7350500	You probably didn't play them enough. I didn't for the first year.
7350500	7353420	I played long enough to know that I hated being a freakin' white mage!
7353420	7356660	Alright, any more emails, or is that it?
7356660	7359660	That, um, oh, there's more.
7359660	7360660	Oh dear.
7360660	7361660	Just a little more, just a little more.
7361660	7362660	Alright.
7362660	7366020	Well, that's all. I hope that this wasn't too long and that I used semicolons in a way
7366020	7369740	that is effective and grammatically correct. After all, I didn't used to use that particular
7369740	7373900	piece of punctuation in school. Thank you for your time, Reddertainment. This message
7373900	7380580	has been brought to you by my Who Killed Amanda Palmer, the solo debut by Amanda Palmer, fucking
7380580	7384220	awesome, and by Olive Garden, my grandma's favorite way to catch food poisoning.
7384220	7389420	Alright, there you go. Free plug for an indie artist there, something worked in.
7389420	7390740	I'm down for that.
7390740	7391740	By the way, uh...
7391740	7393420	Oh my god.
7393420	7394420	What's that?
7394420	7397140	Amanda totally trumped my bacon ice cream.
7397140	7398340	What'd she get?
7398340	7399340	Bacon cinnamon rolls.
7399340	7400340	That's pretty amazing.
7400340	7401340	I don't know.
7401340	7402340	Bacon dessert doesn't seem to go well.
7402340	7403340	That looks delicious.
7403340	7404340	Bacon is meat candy.
7404340	7405340	Bacon is meat candy.
7405340	7406340	Nice.
7406340	7407340	.com.
7407340	7415340	Alright. Is that registered yet? Bacon is meat candy dot com? Take a look. Alright,
7415340	7419340	anyhow, I've been promising an all night long list giveaway.
7419340	7429780	Smile DK, autographing a copy of Darren's Dance Revolution Supernova 2.
7429780	7434820	The five songs we played on the last show we had two weeks ago, Don't Clock Me, Have
7434820	7439380	You Never Been Mellow, the M.M. Groovin' mix. That was the faster mix of the song.
7439380	7443580	In the Heat of the Night, Rain of Sorrow, and the song you just heard there in the background,
7443580	7446820	Dancing All Alone. Those were the songs. Of course, we had to have a song in there by Smile
7446820	7453500	DK. We had a few people get it right. I had Bobby, our buddy who is on before us, pick
7453500	7459980	a number, and he picked the number two. So we grabbed the second email, and the winner
7459980	7465780	of the Smile DK autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2. This is a pretty big prize, so drum roll
7465780	7469780	please, people please.
7469780	7476060	The winner is, the winner does not have an alias, so the winner is Lindsay, Lindsay B.
7476060	7479900	Send in an email that has the right songs all there. I don't know if she's listening
7479900	7484340	right now, but there it is. Lindsay B. won. Congratulations. I will be sending you an
7484340	7490700	email. Please make sure we get your address so we can tell Breslil where to send the prize.
7490700	7496820	Lindsay B. wins the autographed Smile DK. So congrats. Congrats to you.
7496820	7500500	All right. Let's get back into some gaming news then.
7500500	7502460	Do we gotta?
7502460	7503460	Yes we gotta.
7503460	7504460	Woohoo.
7504460	7513660	Well, it's kind of funny. The DSi, you know, that system didn't seem to be, wasn't able
7513660	7522740	to be hacked for a while there, but it was only for a while. Apparently a new DSi working
7522740	7532580	cart from Supercard, they have a new one now, Supercard DS1i, and that actually now works
7532580	7538300	with the DSi and, you know, features all the wonderful ways to get around their different
7538300	7543000	security measures, including all the future ones that may come, because they actually
7543000	7548500	have for the first time a way to update the firmware on the card. And this is independent
7548500	7554260	of actually, because usually with these cards you have to use a micro SD card and you, you
7554260	7557900	know, run a program on there and you update the program and that kind of stuff. Well,
7557900	7563340	now you can actually update the firmware on the card itself using the included USB adapter
7563340	7572500	and so, in theory, this could be unpatchable at some point. And I know that there was some
7572500	7579580	more information out there about some new methods that they're going to be implementing
7579580	7586580	in upcoming DSi games, and we'll get into more of that in a little bit, but that might
7586580	7591980	make that a little bit harder to work. Well, do we always kind of know, like, whenever
7591980	7598500	they say something can't be pirated within five minutes, it is, right? Yeah. So, and
7598500	7604500	Act F says it in chat right there, you can't stop the homebrew community. You just can't.
7604500	7609700	So, I guess that's it then. DSi has already been cracked, and how long has it been out?
7609700	7615940	Two weeks? Three weeks? Well, a little while if you count Japan. No, I guess that's true.
7615940	7619900	Well, some more E3 news. We talked a lot about some great E3 news earlier in the show, but
7619900	7626820	this not so great news. Well, depending on who you're a fan of. Atari, the once great
7626820	7634100	makers of the 2600 system, a landmark in gaming, has pulled out of E3. Atari will not be attending
7634100	7640940	E3 this year, so sadly, no Ghostbusters, Champions Online, or any of that on the show floor.
7640940	7645540	Although Atari does still feel that E3 is beneficial to the industry, they are focused
7645540	7652640	on quote, other selling and marketing initiatives. So, there you go. Sadly, Atari has pulled
7652640	7658140	out of the show. And what's interesting, Atari was always kind of like, every year I went
7658140	7663140	to E3 anyway, Atari was always kind of a satellite room. They were never really on the show floor.
7663140	7666800	Them and Midway always had satellite rooms. So, it'll be interesting to see what happens
7666800	7672640	this year. Oh, there you go. Let's hope Ghostbusters sells lots and lots of copies for Atari or
7672640	7676220	else who knows if they'll be in existence by this time next year for E3. That would
7676220	7681780	be a very sad day. That would just be the end of an era. Indeed, but Sega not putting
7681780	7685160	out hardware anymore was the end of an era of sorts. Well, you know, there's something
7685160	7691980	else though that makes me think that Nintendo hasn't forgotten the sum of its earlier games.
7691980	7698100	And it's a game that's called Muscle March, and that's just put out by Namco. It's a game
7698100	7708100	that's sort of like a puzzle game meets a Mario Kart meets some weird Simon Says sort
7708100	7714860	of game. Sunshine and rainbows. Oh, and muscle-bound men and an overly-muscled woman. Can I play
7714860	7718320	a little bit of the trailer here? Does it have happy, sunshiny music to go with the
7718320	7729540	little picture here? Let me fast forward a little bit here. Oh my gosh, this game looks
7729540	7736340	silly. I'm getting it. I wish. This looks like Incredible Crisis, but with incredibly
7736340	7744020	scantily clad muscle men. No, it's like, do you see how you have to pose the right way?
7744020	7751260	It's human Tetris. Oh God, it's that thing. It's like that game show. Yeah. Oh my God.
7751260	7755260	Ellen does this on her show all the time. Basically, the premise of this story starts
7755260	7761620	off with a football player, like American football, stealing their protein powder. And
7761620	7767940	so they're chasing after the football player, and as you can see here, an alien takes it
7767940	7772100	once they catch the football player. They have to chase after the alien. And basically
7772100	7776860	the alien and the football player and the guys are running through different walls,
7776860	7781220	and you have to pose the way he posed when you go through the wall. And there's a panda
7781220	7786460	bear. Or, what was that? A polar bear. And there is a muscle woman, too, if you're looking
7786460	7791540	for that. But they're running on rainbow trails. I mean, this game is too gay for me. This
7791540	7798260	game totally reeks of Cho Aniki. Just without being a... I'll get this. And I'm completely
7798260	7804980	secure in my homosexuality when I say that. This game looks way too gay for me. I want
7804980	7812300	this game. Hey, it's what, only 800 Wii points? I guess so. And that's what, May 29th or something
7812300	7819580	in Japan? Yep. So, in fact, I will actually link the article from Joystiq in the chat
7819580	7826380	room so that our listeners who are with us live can see it. Bobby Blackwolf says they
7826380	7830220	should put that on the box. You know how they always quote people from magazines and trade
7830220	7834020	publications? They put it on the box. Even though this is a download title. They should
7834020	7838200	put that right there on the box. This game is too gay for me. Rob Roberts. I would be
7838200	7842300	fine with that. I would be completely fine with that. I mean, I guess I should play it
7842300	7846980	before I can definitively say that, but seriously, it's probably, if I were to play it, it would
7846980	7856300	be even gayer. But it's... the game is... yeah. And there's also this particular place
7856300	7860660	where it freezes the screen. There's a giraffe poking its head out of the clouds and a pig
7860660	7868940	flying and muscle-bound men pointing. And gay sex. Lots of butt sex. Surprise butt sex.
7868940	7874380	Ahh! That's the sound of surprise butt sex, by the way. That's the bonus level. Surprise!
7874380	7881060	Yeah. Well, you think that's pretty surprising. Well then, here's something else that'll blow
7881060	7888140	your mind. Apparently someone's actually... Yes, apparently someone has developed a pill
7888140	7895420	that will enhance your first person shooter plane. It's called the FPS Brain Pill. And
7895420	7905140	apparently it will make you see better, I guess. It's a visual performance enhancing
7905140	7916180	capsule. And I guess when caffeine and guarana are not enough. I don't know. For when staying
7916180	7922380	up until 9 o'clock in the morning playing World of Warcraft just isn't long enough.
7922380	7928900	Well this way you can see better. Maybe this will make you see dead people. Maybe this
7928900	7934140	will give you a heart attack, is what might happen. I don't know. Deathwishing in the
7934140	7941820	chatroom asks, chat.orangessauce.com asks, so basically it's caffeine? No, it's not.
7941820	7946740	It's made up of complex ingredients which nurture the human eye. Oh, well I'm sorry.
7946740	7952620	With essential micronutrients that are not sufficiently produced by the body on its own.
7952620	7960220	These and among other trace elements, plant extracts, cartonoids which strengthen and
7960220	7968620	protect the eyes when they're under particular strain. Gamers often sit in front of their
7968620	7974260	screens for hours during the night, especially for them. A sufficient nutrition of the body
7974260	7980440	with vital substance that actively support the eyes as a precondition for healthy and
7980440	7986940	effective eyesight. And blah blah blah. Actually, looking through this, these are basically
7986940	7995300	the same things that you find in those eye formulas. There's actually some really good
7995300	7999900	stuff in here, but really lutein, lycopene, eat a tomato, shit. Eat a tomato every day.
7999900	8006180	You'll be fine. Or take a multivitamin. Multivitamins don't have quite that concentration. It's
8006180	8011580	still a way to get gamers to take their vitamins, you know, just eat a fucking tomato. Well,
8011580	8015500	you can buy it and they have a 110% money back guarantee, so if you don't like it, then
8015500	8025300	you get more money. Cool! I don't like it. Prenatal vitamins. Alright, wait, are you
8025300	8030140	suggesting gamers should take prenatal vitamins? Actually, the stuff that's in prenatal vitamins
8030140	8035260	are pretty freaking good for, you know, keeping the body healthy and hand-eye coordination.
8035260	8040140	Also, it's really good for your hair. Okay, as long as I don't get pregnant. No! That
8040140	8046060	has got to be the single most dumb buddy thing I've ever heard you say. Really? Because I've
8046060	8052540	said a lot in the history of this program. I've said, shut up! I've said a lot of dumb
8052540	8059020	things. Oh, but that's not all. See, that's FBS brain zoom. That's the, um, that, but
8059020	8064540	apparently they also have some other stuff that enhances your reaction time, the FBS
8064540	8071100	brain original. Fortunately, they do not sell anything that will enhance your penis size.
8071100	8074980	That's the only thing they're really missing. I'm gonna tell everybody, all of our listeners,
8074980	8080820	something right now. These ads are bullshit! These products that say they're gonna do this
8080820	8087420	shit, they don't do it! But 110% money back guarantee! That's a guarantee you can stick
8087420	8094780	by! Hey, you get 110% back! That's more than 100%! And I'm not saying this as a representative
8094780	8102180	of the company. I did work at a GNC, and I've been involved in several natural home remedy,
8102180	8107500	you know, courses. I do believe in natural healing, but none of this stuff is gonna be
8107500	8114100	an instant fix. The way you improve your hand-eye coordination is using your hands and eyes
8114100	8119540	together more. You coordinate them through practice. Um, faster reaction times are gonna
8119540	8123260	be done through training. It's not something that a pill's gonna do for you. And there
8123260	8131620	is absolutely zero, no way to grow a bigger dick. It doesn't happen. You cannot use a
8131620	8137980	vacuum tube. You cannot use pills. You could do it surgically. That's about it. And that's
8137980	8139780	not you growing it.
8139780	8145340	Alright. Well, there is no pill that will make you a better dancer. That's for sure,
8145340	8147380	right? There's no pill that will make you a better dancer.
8147380	8149460	I know plenty of people who could use it if it existed.
8149460	8153380	But possibly Dance Dance Revolution will make you a better dancer, although I'll tell you
8153380	8157240	from first-hand experience it does not. But if you want to try anyway, there might be
8157240	8161360	a game coming out a little later for you this year that could be a good starter kit. It's
8161360	8166280	Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1 is apparently the game. Of course, take this with a grain
8166280	8169780	of salt. Konami's not confirming this yet, but apparently some information's leaked out
8169780	8175540	this week that the Wii will be getting this game as well as the Xbox 360 and a debut on
8175540	8181180	the PlayStation 3. Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1, it's a best of. That's right, they
8181180	8187860	are going to be pulling some of the best songs from DDR's history and putting it all into
8187860	8192700	one game. Here's hoping it's not just the Konami originals, because we did already have
8192700	8196100	that game several years ago. It was called Konamiics, but I guess it was the first.
8196100	8200700	And best hits. Best hits didn't come out in the US. I know, but it's still the same thing.
8200700	8205860	I know, this is a little snore, you know, but I guess it's a starter kit for new people,
8205860	8210780	whatever. Way to go. That took no effort. You didn't have to have any more, you know,
8210780	8214580	step charts made. You just said, okay, I want this, this, this, this, this. Let's say it's
8214580	8221300	Konami originals, we can take all that. And we're done. By the way, I just want to say
8221300	8225020	Chat is kind of going a little haywire right now. We do tape live on Sunday nights and
8225020	8228900	live things happen. Apparently there's just been an earthquake in Southern California.
8228900	8233980	Some of our Southern California listeners are saying, whoa, did you feel that one? So
8233980	8238980	they're saying on the quake site, it was a 4.7, which I don't believe is too bad. That's
8238980	8243620	just a little wake up call. Let's hope this doesn't, this isn't a, what do they call it?
8243620	8247880	A pre-quake or what? No, not an aftershock, but a pre-shock to something that's going
8247880	8251540	to happen in three weeks. Cause that would suck. I don't know. Don't die. I don't want
8251540	8259860	to be in LA when fear not. It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over. Shut up. She lives
8259860	8265440	in Florida anyway. Exactly. It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over dark soccer. Please
8265440	8273860	save this show from a Loki. There's going to be another Tony Hawk game. Who cares? Actually,
8273860	8281580	this is going to be a peripheral based game and, um, it's going to be called, um, Tony
8281580	8291140	Hawk Ride. And yeah, this thing is weird. It's going to be on Wii, PS3, and 360. So
8291140	8297500	I don't know. I don't really care. Hitstone would like you to know that he cares. There
8297500	8303820	you go. Okay. Then you can go check out the official website at thride.com. Yes. And it's
8303820	8311420	a big old skateboard controller as rumored numerous times before. No one's surprised.
8311420	8315180	Yeah. Um, I, I'm like, when I heard this this week, I was like, I thought we already heard
8315180	8320000	this, but I guess it was just kinda under the radar before. But, uh, yep. Yet another
8320000	8323940	peripheral to fill up your house. There you go. A skateboard controller. Maybe I'll have
8323940	8328900	to get it on top of the boxes. I knew it. Dark soccer. The minute she hears, Oh, peripheral.
8328900	8333780	She's like, ah, fuck. I got to get this. No, the only way, you know what? There is one
8333780	8337580	game. I would have wanted something like that for, and that was, what was it called? Air
8337580	8343260	tricks. The Sega skateboarding game. That would have been cool. Otherwise, no, you know
8343260	8347620	what? They should put out the skateboard controller and then they should put out jet set radio,
8347620	8354380	like a new version of it. Would that not, especially with the Wii, huh? Hey, except
8354380	8363900	you are roller bleeding. You know what? Hater haters to the left, please. Thank you. So
8363900	8370780	that it's a sequel. Now they're on skateboards. It's a little different. That is lame. I hate
8370780	8375740	you. Just a couple more stories. Then we'll be taking your phone calls. A one eight seven
8375740	8382100	seven game. Oh, LR. Not just yet though. Let you know when. So, um, as I alluded to earlier,
8382100	8387900	they're a metaphoric. They're, um, I guess a former game developer, and now they're frustrated
8387900	8395300	by piracy. So they have come up with a new, um, technique that will basically, um, allow
8395300	8400020	each game that's put out to have a different security scheme. And it basically turns the
8400020	8406260	game into its own security system. And it apparently does a check with some data that's
8406260	8411260	stored on the cart. Something that's going to be broken really fast, basically, but will
8411260	8416920	hopefully delay releases and that kind of stuff. I don't think it's going to, but not
8416920	8422280	related to the story. And I'm going to bring it up anyways right now. We may have talked
8422280	8429260	about it a little bit before Kojima Productions has a new teaser page for some secret project.
8429260	8436420	And wouldn't you know it? There is something that looks like a five or possibly an S. So
8436420	8444020	we're either going to get a snatcher game or maybe Metal Gear Solid 5. Uh oh. With a
8444020	8450740	new countdown. And maybe that's what they're going to show on the, uh, the press conference
8450740	8454620	that they're saying, you know, if, you know. Dude, you know they're going to fucking do
8454620	8464060	it. Maybe. I don't know. Who knows? We'll see. Interesting. Alright. Well, one more
8464060	8467420	story for you guys and it's one more big, big, big rumor and then we're going to get
8467420	8472940	to the calls. This could be interesting. A digital entertainment handheld that they say
8472940	8480060	will do absolutely everything if you are to believe the rumors about the Zune HD. That's
8480060	8485980	right. Uh, it was a report from Team Xbox apparently. The Zune HD allegedly is going
8485980	8491320	to be revealed at E3. It's a portable game console and media player. It will link to
8491320	8497100	the Skybox, another Microsoft system. It will integrate current Zune and Xbox marketplaces
8497100	8502460	together and apparently something very similar to the NXC is going to be the function that
8502460	8508240	kind of drives the handheld. So in a way it's their foray into handheld gaming but not really
8508240	8512740	because it's still kind of like an iPod-ish type of device. It's still the Zune. But here's
8512740	8517460	the other big catch and this is why I'm kind of like, you know, very skeptical about this.
8517460	8522100	Personally, the Zune HD, you will also be able to play Xbox Live Arcade games either
8522100	8526660	on your Xbox or your handheld. That's where I stop believing that this is true. I think
8526660	8532140	that's too much. Well, no. It's not necessarily too much. Only certain games. It's not all
8532140	8538060	games. Maybe certain newer games that are developed with both together. You know, just
8538060	8544140	like the XNA stuff. The XNA stuff you can develop for the Zune and for Xbox Live Arcade
8544140	8547820	and you use that same toolset but now you have that full Xbox Live Arcade games that
8547820	8552380	are cross-compatible. I would believe that the XNA games would run on this but I don't
8552380	8556320	know. I mean, they have some pretty elaborate shit on Xbox Live Arcade now. I just can't
8556320	8559980	imagine you're going to have something with the power of an Xbox 360 in your pocket. You
8559980	8568980	know how much noise that'll make? I mean, but really. So. We'll see. Frisbee is mad
8568980	8573020	that everything's getting called HD. He says, quit calling everything HD. Blah, blah, blah
8573020	8578820	HD. That is kind of a generic name. Don't you think Microsoft could do better than that?
8578820	8582340	Especially if they're calling their other thing the Fluid? Couldn't they call this the
8582340	8588420	Zune Fluid or something? I don't know. It makes me think of P. Don't talk about that.
8588420	8592380	I actually have to kind of go to the restroom and we got to take calls. So, we're going
8592380	8597780	to open up the Skype line now for your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is
8597780	8603300	OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8603300	8608380	Whoa, it's freezing up. Hi, it's freezing up. What's freezing up? Are you having another
8608380	8614900	earthquake? Whoa, no. It's springing, but I'm called in. Oh, there we go. Hi, introduce
8614900	8619940	yourself for our listeners, please. It's Deathwishing. Hi, Deathwishing. Talk to Jamie while I go
8619940	8626380	to the bathroom. Hi. Quick, follow him in there. We can tackle him. That's okay. I'd
8626380	8632700	rather not because the cat also uses that bathroom. So, what's up? Fuel. That racing
8632700	8637580	game? Yeah. Fuel? Yeah, it's awesome. Or it looks awesome. Oh, I don't know. I'm on a
8637580	8643020	pre-order thing here and I can't decide which game to pre-order. It is Red Faction Guerrilla
8643020	8650260	or Fuel and that looks like Motorstorm on steroids and then Red Faction's Red Faction.
8650260	8657100	Well, it depends if you want a racing game or more of like, you know, a sandbox-y game.
8657100	8667580	Or do I want Global Warming or Mars? Yeah. Global Warming for the win, I think. Yay.
8667580	8675020	On the other part, we need to strap down Rosie O'Donnell just to get that thought out. I'm
8675020	8681500	trying to think here, a little bit of shocker over here, you know what happened, but I'm
8681500	8688860	still playing Street Fighter. I think that's all we need to know. Cool. Yeah. Who's actually
8688860	8697400	your primary now? Primary? Yeah, entry-fighter. Your main person. Sagat. Sagat now. Really?
8697400	8707020	Any particular reason? Tiger uppercut. Is that all? Oh, and Tiger Knee. Looks like he's
8707020	8713180	kicking him in the balls. Just way more hardcore. I'm still totally taken with using Sakura,
8713180	8719580	of course. That's because your name's Dark Sakura. If she played more like the one from
8719580	8728820	SNK vs. Capcom with a really weird run into her uppercut, it'd be really cool. I haven't
8728820	8737060	noticed that. She plays a lot like an interesting combination of Alpha 2, Alpha 3. Well, Street
8737060	8743540	Fighter IV is my first real Street Fighter. What do you want, lazy? Go back and play Alpha
8743540	8752640	2. But I'm a young kid. I have to stick with the young games. It makes me hip. That means
8752640	8756820	you're doing research. You know what? Respect your elders. Hi, I'm back. Respect your elders.
8756820	8761940	You need to discover your roots of gaming. Seriously, go back and play Alpha 2. Young
8761940	8769500	whippersnappers. Road Rash is better than every game out. Says you. Alright, says me.
8769500	8776860	What did I miss? You missed me wanting to tie down Rosie O'Donnell. Wait, are you in
8776860	8782980	L.A., Death Wishing? Hainton Beach. So close enough, did you feel that earthquake? I ran
8782980	8789660	down the stairs. Wow, so it was pretty bad then, huh? Right as you guys were talking
8789660	8794720	about the first person shooter pill, which, like I said, I have permanent eye improvement
8794720	8801980	called glasses. You put them on and you get better vision. Some people in chat asked if
8801980	8805300	we felt the earthquake, but we're way too far away to feel an earthquake. Like the big
8805300	8810100	one could hit L.A. and we wouldn't feel it up here. Another gamer pill is called carrots.
8810100	8816460	They help your eyesight. Carrots are pretty amazing, actually. And they do have pills
8816460	8821060	out there, actually, that's just carrots. Just make sure you get the right hole. But
8821060	8828980	if you eat, wow, if you eat too many carrots, your face will turn orange. This is true.
8828980	8832220	This happened to me when I was a kid. I want to look like an Oompa Loompa. It happened
8832220	8839860	to this person, too. Did you ever watch the Partridge Family? Danny Bonaduce? No, Susan
8839860	8844500	Day. Really? Yeah, she pretty much starved herself and ate nothing but carrots and she
8844500	8847820	turned orange. This kid has no idea what the Partridge Family was. Do you know what the
8847820	8854980	Partridge Family is? Huh? Oh, God. All right. Do you have any final thoughts before I let
8854980	8864980	you go? Should I pre-order Fuel or Red Faction Gorilla? Red Faction Gorilla. Okay. All right,
8864980	8871880	bye. I'll see about that. Okay, but thanks, bye. I don't know, I just picked a better
8871880	8875680	sounding one. I have no idea what those games are. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's
8875680	8881380	this? Hey, C1LE Ronmo. What's up, everyone? Hi, not much. I was just yelling at the previous
8881380	8885800	listener. Please tell me you know who the Partridge Family is. I grew up watching the
8885800	8891780	Partridge Family. Come on, get happy. There's a song that we're singing. Don't. Come on,
8891780	8895380	get happy. All right, come on. Everybody knows that one. All right, Ronmo, what's on your
8895380	8902440	mind tonight, buddy? Did you Twitter from the bathroom? I did not Twitter from the bathroom.
8902440	8907740	I left my phone in here, thank you very much. Okay, all right, all right, all right. It
8907740	8913940	was just a pee, too. It wasn't a poop, so it's a lot harder to Twitter while you pee.
8913940	8918180	And I'm afraid of getting the phone wet, so I wouldn't want to do that. You got a point
8918180	8928060	there. I always have a point. The chat room's like, ah. Whatever. Anyhow, what's on your
8928060	8934340	mind? Shirley, you didn't just call and ask me about my bathroom. Call him Shirley. Or
8934340	8942300	Shirley. Speak. Okay, last week I helped a friend download Patapon 2, and it kind of
8942300	8947620	blew up in our faces. Like the game literally blew up in your face, or what happened? It
8947620	8954660	was being held trying to download the software to our PFE. I don't understand. Like, what
8954660	8959180	happened? All right, pretty much, we hooked it up to my laptop. I'm running Windows 7,
8959180	8964060	so I figured, okay, it'll download. The Sony software stopped halfway and said, I'm running
8964060	8969020	an unauthorized operating system, this will now shut down. After doing that twice, we
8969020	8974500	went to an XP machine, started downloading everything, it started running, we downloaded
8974500	8981380	Patapon, we walked out, we come back, the download timed out. Interesting. Why don't
8981380	8988020	you try downloading it through the PSP? The funny thing is, it wouldn't let her update
8988020	8993300	the firmware, she was running version 3.7 or something like that. Holy crap. Yeah, and
8993300	8998220	we tried to update the firmware, and it was like, it says you're running the latest one.
8998220	9001240	Well it sounds like Sony's gonna sell tons of copies of this stuff with all these hurdles
9001240	9007400	going on. I bet I can get that game faster then. This almost sounds like a challenge.
9007400	9011980	Is it faster to download Patapon 2 legally or illegally? This should be like a challenge
9011980	9018020	we do on the show next week. That might be fun. Not for nothing, it took me like 30 minutes
9018020	9023660	to pull down Rock Band Unplugged. Did you finally get your copy of Patapon 2, or are
9023660	9027420	you still kind of waiting? We got it for her, and she was really pissed about it because
9027420	9033260	she didn't even realize that it was a downloadable title when she bought it. Oh, I see, she
9033260	9039980	bought it at the store? Okay, gotcha. Interesting, well thanks for the heads up. I could probably
9039980	9044140	have it in a minute, but I'm not going to. Do not waste the bandwidth in here. Alright,
9044140	9048660	so anyway, Rama, anything else you want to call in about tonight? Rock Band Unplugged
9048660	9055820	is pretty good, and Rob, in response to 9 people in the hotel room at ASEN, need I remind
9055820	9061220	you about Katakan? Yeah, but that room at Katakan was much bigger. Like, you had a suite
9061220	9067460	at Katakan. We're talking like a standard two bed room at ASEN. I have stayed in rooms
9067460	9073820	where they fed 15 people in there, and people sleep on shifts. I've done it. Oh my god,
9073820	9081740	now I'm just, I'm too old for this. You know, no, I mean, and certainly no disrespect, I
9081740	9085740	had a lot of fun, and you know, I did finally get my sleep, but you know, I definitely,
9085740	9088800	you know, somebody said they could kind of see it in me on Saturday. I was definitely
9088800	9093040	feeling tired just because, you know, so many people and so on, so it took me a while to
9093040	9098620	catch up. I was so dead at work on Monday and Tuesday, it was not even funny. Like,
9098620	9102140	I took like a five hour nap. It was pretty disgusting. Did you call out because you had
9102140	9106900	the comp leg? No, I couldn't. You know, in my job, you can't really call in sick unless
9106900	9112020	you are like really, really sick, especially when you have huge important projects that
9112020	9117620	have to be done when you teach, so. Oh, okay. Alright, well, Rama, we're going to let you
9117620	9121420	go so we can get some more calls, but have a good one, and hopefully the next convention
9121420	9128980	I go to, you'll be there. Most definitely. Alright, take care, buddy. Later. Later. 1-877-GAME-OLR,
9128980	9132420	our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but the calls are coming in back to back tonight.
9132420	9137020	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hey, what's up? It's the Rob D. Rob, how you
9137020	9141860	doing? Not too shabby. Just got home from work, and I'm like, oh my God, has OrangeLoungeRadio
9141860	9145980	taken calls yet? I don't know. We just started taking calls. You're just in time. I did talk
9145980	9149820	earlier in the show, and I did congratulate you on your Street Fighter IV win at ASUM.
9149820	9153900	Thank you very much. And was talking a little bit about the experience in the hotel room
9153900	9158520	playing on the Xbox 360 and the two arcade sticks, which actually was a lot of fun. I
9158520	9162380	almost want to get an arcade stick. They're nice. I mean, I never thought I'd be one of
9162380	9165540	those guys who actually takes arcade sticks, and I despise myself just a little bit more
9165540	9169740	as a human being, just for actually being one of those people who uses an arcade stick,
9169740	9175940	but it's worth it. How did your panel go? I never got to ask. It went really well. I
9175940	9179780	mean, people really got a huge kick out of it, and we ended up getting pretty much in
9179780	9186140	almost full room at the biggest panel room at the convention, short of the main programming
9186140	9190760	area where they have thousands of seats and that sort of thing. That's amazing. Congratulations.
9190760	9195260	I have to admit I'm a little jealous. And I actually just found out that I have a panel
9195260	9199700	at Otacon, so that's going to be interesting. Wow. Well, go you. I mean, the stuff I saw,
9199700	9203380	I didn't get to see the panel. I wish you guys would have taped it or something, but
9203380	9210140	I do have a tape. It's not great quality because it was taken on a really small digital camera.
9210140	9216940	I think Misty taped it. Misty gave it to one of Jason, the crazy kid's brothers. Gotcha.
9216940	9221380	I have the video. I think I'm going to end up subtitling it and seeing how that turns
9221380	9225060	out because you can hardly hear anything. Or if you're going to do the same thing at
9225060	9228900	the next panel, take a better camera next time. Be ready. Be ready with a video camera.
9228900	9233740	It would be fun. Oh, yeah. But that's great. The stuff I saw, tell the listeners, because
9233740	9236620	we're talking about this panel. Nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about. Tell the
9236620	9241060	listeners a little bit about what you did at this panel that had a full crowd. Well,
9241060	9246140	last year when we went to Otacon, we saw this Sonic the Hedgehog panel, and I laugh if they
9246140	9249580	actually listen to this, although I doubt it. And they did a terrible, terrible job.
9249580	9253640	The whole thing was basically the people who did it took a timeline of the Sonic games
9253640	9257780	and was like, oh, and then Sonic Shovel came out. Who doesn't remember Sonic Shovel? And
9257780	9261660	then everyone would go, woo! And that was pretty much it. And it sucked. So we decided,
9261660	9265780	okay, if they're going to do bad video game panels, let's make a good video game panel.
9265780	9269180	And we realized, what would people actually want to hear about? What would people laugh
9269180	9274380	at that they don't really know about? So we decided to compile a list of some of the worst
9274380	9279340	writing and some of the worst examples of video game tropes. And we decided to do a
9279340	9285540	little presentation about it and compile an hour-long thing about it with slides, with
9285540	9289820	pre-written stuff. And it turned out really well. We have a whole section on stupid Mega
9289820	9294300	Man robot masters, bad video game covers, the introduction of Blaster Master and the
9294300	9300900	Americanization of it, where instead of having this basic storyline of this guy battling
9300900	9305900	in a post-apocalyptic world in this Gundam, well, not Gundam-style tank, but in this whole
9305900	9309580	one technologically advanced tank that's so much better than everything else, how they
9309580	9316140	localize that into this kid is chasing after his giant frog that just turned giant because
9316140	9320420	this radioactive box that just happened to be in his front yard. And he decided to jump
9320420	9325460	down a hole and find this tank and start blowing up this underground society he knows nothing
9325460	9331680	about. It's great, really. And this is completely true? Yes. Wow. And see, the thing is that
9331680	9336420	I love Blaster Master. It's one of my favorite NES games, definitely my top five. And I never
9336420	9341580	knew this. I just never thought to research it. I just accepted the FX9 novelization as
9341580	9347860	gospel and never realized there was this whole other real story behind it. It's amazing.
9347860	9351820	Yeah, it's hilarious. And like I said, we did a huge list of it. And actually, we still
9351820	9356260	have material left over. And we've actually even gotten some good ideas from some of the
9356260	9360300	people attending our panel as well. We always ask at the end to see if anyone has anything
9360300	9364100	else. Honestly, if we wanted to do a two-hour panel and wanted to put in the work for that,
9364100	9369980	we probably could. So you're traveling video game comics. This is pretty amazing. Yeah,
9369980	9374100	it's fun so far. We'll see how long we do it and how many cons we can do it at. Basically,
9374100	9377940	if you'll give us a free badge and we can find cheap hotel, we'll do it. Well, hey,
9377940	9383280	there you go. You know what? Maybe we need to start working on something for Fanime 2010.
9383280	9389280	We want to, but California's a little bit far away from us Illinois boys. Take a look
9389280	9394340	at Southwest out of Midway. They have some direct flights. We'll work on that for next
9394340	9399860	year. All right, do that. Anyhow, Rob D, any other con thoughts or thoughts in general
9399860	9405260	you want to share tonight? Oh man, the convention was a lot of fun. Actually, it's funny. After
9405260	9409060	finals, because I had a couple finals to take right after, I really just need another break
9409060	9412340	from reality. So I'm actually going to be going to Anime North, although I have no panel
9412340	9417580	this weekend. You're just a blood for punishment with these two. I'm a con whore at this point.
9417580	9422980	I have nothing else to say about that. It'll be my first trip to Canada in a good 10 years.
9422980	9428060	Part of me, even though I'm not doing anything at Fanime, I do kind of want to go just to
9428060	9431740	kind of peek. Part of me thinks I might end up there at least one day just kind of looking
9431740	9435860	around because I'm supposed to be in the Bay Area anyway. But we'll see. We'll see. I'm
9435860	9440500	a little iffy right now. Maybe they'll have a game room that doesn't have half the TVs
9440500	9446380	turned off. Fanime always has a really good game room, actually. So we'll see. We'll see.
9446380	9451960	But I have a lot going on next weekend. We'll see. There's a lot. Rob, any other thoughts
9451960	9452960	for our listeners before I let you go?
9452960	9455860	Well, I'd love to talk about Tatsunoko versus Capcom and how we're actually getting some
9455860	9460580	Tatsu with some, you know, I can play as Ryu and Ken. Oh, wait. Wait, not that Ken. But
9460580	9466380	no, I'm excited for that coming to the U.S. or at least very, you know, almost confirmed
9466380	9467380	for the U.S. if nothing else.
9467380	9471580	Now, since you just joined us, did you hear that they have kind of looked at one of the
9471580	9475860	screenshots and you can tell that three characters have already been axed, which we kind of figured
9475860	9478500	was going to, you know, we said when we were kind of talking about this earlier in the
9478500	9483140	show, we were like, well, wait a minute. Maybe they got the licensing, but don't guarantee
9483140	9487440	that they got all of it. And sure enough, three of the characters have been cut, apparently.
9487440	9490700	That's interesting. I didn't know about that. I'll have to look into that. But I guess it's
9490700	9494460	not too surprising considering that's just a nightmare in the U.S. and any other country
9494460	9495460	other than Japan.
9495460	9498940	Exactly. And folks are asking again which characters got axed. Do you remember, Loki,
9498940	9501340	or where you read that? Do you remember who the ones were?
9501340	9503740	One of them was Condorno Joe.
9503740	9513260	It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and... I don't remember the last one.
9513260	9516580	R something real. Riolo? I don't remember.
9516580	9517580	Yeah, Ryu.
9517580	9518580	Exactly, Ryu.
9518580	9519580	No, not Ryu.
9519580	9520580	Ryu won't be in there.
9520580	9521580	Licensing for Ryu.
9521580	9524060	Somebody in chat will yell it out in just a moment. That's what usually happens once
9524060	9525700	they get through the delay.
9525700	9529580	Will Kiyop from Battle of the Planets be in there or Ace Goodheart from G-Force?
9529580	9530580	Sorry.
9530580	9532580	I don't think everybody else is still in there.
9532580	9533580	We'll see.
9533580	9539500	Anyway, Rob, we better let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks for the call
9539500	9543300	and congratulations again and good luck with your traveling band of comedy.
9543300	9545260	Thank you very much. I'll see you later.
9545260	9548420	All right. Take care, buddy.
9548420	9553740	We got time for a couple more calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9553740	9558180	We can probably squeeze at least one more call in before the night's up. Go ahead and
9558180	9561740	give us a call. Do we have any last minute stories real quick before we say good night?
9561740	9563740	Yes, I've been collecting them.
9563740	9568540	Hold on. We got a call. Hi, Aaron. OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9568540	9569540	It's GS68.
9569540	9573980	Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?
9573980	9577260	Don't bother responding to me next year. I think ASEN needs more of your attention.
9577260	9578260	Wait. What's this?
9578260	9586340	Don't bother responding to me. Nobody in front of Bay Area was able to overlap with me.
9586340	9589980	I know. We've skipped out on the past two years. It just hasn't worked out, but dude,
9589980	9593580	ASEN is expensive to go to. I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it again next
9593580	9596180	year, so I definitely want to keep it local, I think.
9596180	9608060	Well, at least listeners would go to ASEN, but I don't know anyone who would go to...
9608060	9613100	I know anyone who would go to find me if all of them wasn't doing it on our panel.
9613100	9616780	Well, if we plugged it more because we're going, we might get it. The one year we did
9616780	9622780	do a panel, we had an okay turnout. It was nice. It was cool to meet some people. Plus,
9622780	9626580	something else to consider, there's a lot of our old DDR buddies are really involved
9626580	9630060	with Fonami, which is why I'm not going to talk negative about the con because I have
9630060	9632780	nothing negative to say. It's just the timing never seems to work out because they do it
9632780	9635160	on a really busy weekend.
9635160	9640700	But a lot of our old DDR buddies are very heavily involved with Fonami. Wendell is still
9640700	9647700	holding down the fort at stage zero, right? And I know, I can't remember his online name.
9647700	9653700	I'm getting called out from the DDR scene. I haven't played DDR regularly in a long time.
9653700	9661140	Yeah, so we'll definitely make it back probably next year because next year also is I'm trying
9661140	9666500	to plan. I don't know if it's really going to happen, but I'm having an idea for a Japan
9666500	9670780	tour dangled in front of me and I kind of want to do it. So it just depends on money
9670780	9676860	and all that's good stuff. But if I do that, then no trips to the Midwest next year or
9676860	9679980	even probably the East Coast because Japan will.
9679980	9686180	I will be mostly doing a con report during the con or the week after and also be leaving
9686180	9689700	updates on Twitter about the con at Fonami.
9689700	9692300	What you're going to have to do, you're going to have to get some more listeners while you're
9692300	9693300	at the show.
9693300	9694300	Hopefully.
9694300	9703060	I also want to talk about like last week or so, there's a new version of a version that
9703060	9709700	P3GameNet really plugged on the mailbag several episodes ago and it has speedrun mode after
9709700	9710700	you beat the games.
9710700	9711700	Wait.
9711700	9712700	They got me thinking.
9712700	9715940	Sorry, which game is this?
9715940	9723140	A version. It's a QT platformer game where you run around like chains of walls and collect
9723140	9724140	gems.
9724140	9725140	It's okay.
9725140	9729020	Yeah, there's a new version where after you beat the games, there's a time attack mode
9729020	9733860	and they got me thinking, more games where you, that kind of stuff. I mean, it kind of,
9733860	9738700	I mean, it didn't mean to play the game again.
9738700	9742180	You know, it's kind of cool. It's kind of cool when they will patch in new modes like
9742180	9746140	that and new features to really extend the game's life because yeah, I mean, it gets
9746140	9750780	people excited to kind of pop in a game they might've ignored again and go back to. Burnout
9750780	9756460	Paradise, excellent example of a game that's been doing this very, very well.
9756460	9760740	I know people that bought Burnout Paradise, sold it back, and then bought it again to
9760740	9763820	play the download content.
9763820	9769020	And on that topic, it hurts me when people say, oh, stop speedrunning the game or stop
9769020	9775700	playing for score. Just have fun. I mean, there are ones now telling it, impeding on
9775700	9780420	the fun of people like me who like to play for time or for score and there's some people
9780420	9786780	playing for score for time is fun. So these kind of people just need to let everyone play
9786780	9787660	their own way.
9787660	9791700	It's your fucking quarter. Do what you want. Everyone else can buzz off. As long as you're
9791700	9796140	not breaking a machine or doing things, just do what you want. It's your quarter.
9796140	9800300	Yeah. Last week I was in another chat room and I was talking about guitar heroes scoring
9800300	9806220	how the whole multiplier thing and someone was yelling the thing. No, nobody cares about
9806220	9811700	the score. You're the guitar hero. Go play the music and I'm like, okay, but what about
9811700	9813340	the people who do play for score?
9813340	9818060	It's like Perfect Attack versus Freestyle and DDR. People just are into what they're
9818060	9822660	into. If you want to really impress me, do both at the same time. There you go. I'd get
9822660	9826860	to see that, a Perfect Attack freestyle. That'd be pretty awesome.
9826860	9830940	I should maybe provide Poppin' Music freestyle.
9830940	9835620	Oh, God. Poppin' Music freestyle. I don't know about that one, especially because there
9835620	9840340	hasn't been any consumer one in a long time. I know. It was in a movie once, like a couple
9840340	9842020	years ago. They had some guy doing-
9842020	9843020	Was that lost in translation?
9843020	9848740	Yeah, yeah. It was lost in translation, but yeah, there hasn't been a lot of movement
9848740	9851740	in that scene in a while, but also keep in mind, there's been no Poppin' Music consumer
9851740	9856340	style in quite a while, so it's kind of a-
9856340	9863900	Yeah. We haven't seen- Yeah, Poppin' is going through what I call 2DX consumer syndrome
9863900	9871660	style. It's usually between 2DX and 6 on PS2, and then another delay between 6 and 7.
9871660	9878420	Oh, yeah. I remember that. It could be. It could be, but if Konami were smart, they would
9878420	9882580	just nuke all of their franchises and start them over again on PlayStation 3 or next-gen
9882580	9886460	hardware. PlayStation 3 would be good, because then you can import that. There you go. It'd
9886460	9887460	be nice.
9887460	9892260	I don't think it started on Poppin' last October, so it'll be nice if it could be 15 and 16
9892260	9898260	on PS2. Maybe have a single compilation, so that way the series will be caught up.
9898260	9902300	We'll see. I mean, the rumor is the next 2DX on PlayStation 2 is just going to have a crap
9902300	9906220	load of songs, but rumors are rumors. We'll see. Anyway, JSXTO, we've got to let you go.
9906220	9910780	We need to go and wrap up the show, but thanks so much for your call, and have fun at Fandame,
9910780	9912420	and we expect a full report next week.
9912420	9913900	All right. Okay. Bye.
9913900	9918140	Take care. All right. That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight. I'm so sorry to
9918140	9920740	those that didn't get through. I know some of you folks wanted to call in and talk about
9920740	9925060	other things, but it just happened. Sometimes we get slammed on the phone line, so there
9925060	9926060	you have it.
9926060	9929100	We've got to get out of here, though. It's going to be a late night. We've been here
9929100	9934220	since 6 o'clock. It's already 9-12. We still have the live-only segment in a little bit,
9934220	9937820	and all that other stuff, so we've got to tie it all up and get out of here, but first,
9937820	9940500	other last-minute stories before we pull the plug on tonight's show.
9940500	9948140	Oh, yeah. I got a ton. Anyways, so where was I? Oh, so apparently there's a rumor that
9948140	9952820	Battlefield Heroes is going to be headed to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Network, and
9952820	9958100	Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade. As you remember, I believe Battlefield Heroes is the free-to-play
9958100	9965980	game that they have online, a kind of a deathmatch-only flair, but apparently it's listed as coming
9965980	9973140	out in June 2009, according to EA's press page, and perhaps this is something they're
9973140	9982180	going to be talking about during E3, maybe. Might be neat.
9982180	9994040	Also for Wii Sports Resort, there's been two more games revealed from a Japanese commercial.
9994040	9999660	Apparently golf and table tennis will be in Wii Sports Resort. You may remember table
9999660	10005580	tennis was in Wii Play, and golf was in the original Wii Sports. Awesome! They're recycling
10005580	10008660	minigames now. Go Nintendo.
10008660	10009660	Wow.
10009660	10016740	Let's see, but now it's more precise, but yet they don't have, well, they have table
10016740	10021900	tennis, I guess, but they don't have, well, whatever. Yes. This is interesting. Apparently
10021900	10028300	a new game has been rated by the ESRB for the Wii. It is mature-rated. It's called Sexy
10028300	10033980	Poker. Yes, Sexy Poker, which the content descriptors are nudity, sexual themes, and
10033980	10039080	simulated gambling. Apparently the description of it is it's a strip poker game in which
10039080	10044020	players engage in games of blackjack and poker against female avatar opponents. The object
10044020	10047620	of the game is to win hands in order to remove articles of clothing from still images of
10047620	10053360	female characters. Nurses, police, women, office workers, and sports figures can eventually
10053360	10059040	be stripped down to show their bare breasts. Ooh, adult games on the Wii. Yeah, I remember
10059040	10062780	strip poker games on the Commodore 64. They were epic. Yeah, but you'd think something
10062780	10069060	like this. Pixelated boobies. They just wouldn't be, you know, coming out on the Wii, because
10069060	10075620	the Wii's a family system, so it's kind of surprising. There's a, this is kind of interesting,
10075620	10082500	Hull Breach Online, the first MMORPG for the Wii's internet channel, has now apparently
10082500	10089860	been scaled down to run on the DSi browser. So yes, it's a free-to-play MMO, and apparently
10089860	10095260	space-themed, and looks very basic, but I can imagine that you can't really do too much
10095260	10104420	with the DSi browser. Kind of limited. And then a little bit more information about Tatsunoko
10104420	10111560	vs. Capcom. The game's now being called Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars, and apparently
10111560	10116360	online play may be added in. New characters might happen, and it's supposed to be due
10116360	10120940	out before the end of the year. Actually, I was wondering though, because after some
10120940	10123860	thought, the characters that you were saying were cut were never in the Japanese version
10123860	10133300	to begin with. Yeah, well, I don't know. And then finally, it's just kind of interesting.
10133300	10139940	Coming from CodeJunkies.com, they have a new accessory that's out now for the Xbox 360.
10139940	10147080	They apparently have figured out how to reverse-engineer the memory cards. Now you can get a device
10147080	10155300	for as cheap as $39.99, and it will use microSD cards, so you can store up to 16GB of data
10155300	10160580	on there. And if you think about that, since it doesn't have all the backwards compatibility
10160580	10166580	stuff, like the Xbox 360 hard drives, it's actually larger than the Xbox 360 20GB hard
10166580	10172860	drives, now in memory card form, so you can get these really cheap. And microSD cards,
10172860	10177660	those are pretty damn cheap nowadays, especially the 4GB and 16GB ones. I think I just got
10177660	10188580	a, well it wasn't a microSD, but just a standard HD card for $50, so 16GB. So, I mean, that's
10188580	10193580	amazing. And now that they come up with this, I'm sure that the hacking scene is going to
10193580	10197020	take notice, and they're going to figure out a way to put any sort of hard drive on there.
10197020	10202020	Goody goody. So, matter of time. And that's it.
10202020	10205980	Alright, well that is going to do it for another week here at Orange Launch Radio. It's time
10205980	10211580	to go around and wrap things up with our final thoughts. DarkSakura, whose home we've invaded
10211580	10214980	now with Orange Launch Radio, and it looks like we will be for the near future. Your
10214980	10215980	final thought tonight?
10215980	10217700	Let's go see Star Trek Tuesday.
10217700	10222660	Maybe. I don't know yet what I've got going on. But maybe. I do want to see it again.
10222660	10224740	Lowkey, your final thought?
10224740	10229060	This chair hurts my butt, and I'm going to play some Bion Commander this week.
10229060	10234620	Awesome. I don't really have much of a final thought, except I'm excited to be going to
10234620	10240060	LA in a couple weeks, and things are good. So that's it. Hopefully I get to play more
10240060	10243460	games this week. That's my final thought. Thank you guys so much for downloading and
