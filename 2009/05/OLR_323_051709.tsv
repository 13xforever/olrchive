16376	24557	The studio behind Duke Nukem Forever closes, details are revealed on Guitar Hero 5, and could a popular import fighting game be US bound?
31513	32114	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
55373	56534	What are you doing in my house?
83749	84009	DarkSakura.com
109784	113667	Anyway, I won't bore you with the details, but I will bore you with the one and only Techmaster Loki!
113967	114427	Hello.
114727	115488	How are you doing, Loki?
116308	116889	Could be better.
117389	117749	Oh, really?
118510	120351	I'm sitting on a sep stool.
120511	121672	It's hard as a rock.
123098	123698	We'll figure it out.
124098	125658	Maybe at the halfway point we can switch.
126519	128819	We can get you a chair for next week.
128999	130279	We'll figure something out.
130959	131459	We'll work it out.
132520	139021	Anyhow, we're back, and of course we have a little time to catch up on, so we'll play a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week?
139281	140521	Because that's how we always start things off.
140541	141361	So How Was Your Gaming Week?
142181	144562	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
145822	149663	Well, I played Sims.
150183	151443	Sims 2, that's about it.
152179	152840	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
165794	168417	So, just to see how it worked.
168517	169217	And now I'm curious.
169618	170038	Okay.
170599	172021	We'll leave it at that then, I suppose.
172521	173442	Are you excited for Sims 3?
174263	174684	Kind of.
174864	177827	I was looking on the Twitter earlier and looking at the friends list on the Twitter.
178228	181752	And apparently some of our listeners are pretty excited because I guess Sims 3 just leaked out.
181832	184895	So, some folks are already downloading that and having fun with it.
185116	185656	Really?
186477	186817	Uh-oh.
187458	188219	No, not during the show.
188399	189340	Yeah, not during the show.
191101	195024	Leave it to Loki in five minutes to try and pirate something from the new location.
195104	195465	Jeez.
196347	197147	and Cher.
198368	199268	I'm not surprised though.
201709	203110	Although I am surprised it's so early.
203130	204770	A lot of EA leaks this week.
204870	207331	But of course, Loki will buy the game if he enjoys it.
207511	208432	Of course I will.
209452	211033	No, I probably won't enjoy it though.
211073	214774	Just like I enjoyed Spore.
215294	218195	I found the case for that today with the DVD inside.
218215	219716	I'm like, oh yeah, I have Spore.
221156	222197	More like Boar.
223732	225333	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
242887	244128	Bitch in the half to flash.
247729	260235	The setup I had didn't want to work with it correctly, and so it was able to grab the key and that kind of stuff, but I had to actually take my broken 360 and take that drive and spoof it as the one.
260315	270821	Anyways, so basically I have four modded systems now, and the whole reason we have four modded systems is because we're playing four modded copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 in our company deathmatch that we do.
272061	289308	and it's all sorts of fun right now we're testing out some of the new weapons that I'm building for it one of them is kind of like I'm calling it the hurricane bomb and basically what it does is you fire it and it creates a giant physics force that will toss people around um
289989	294971	No damage, but it will throw people and you can throw them into walls and stuff and that causes damage.
295391	297852	So we've been playing with that and it's absolutely distracting.
298152	299613	You know what kind of weapon you need to make?
299813	303355	And maybe I just have Star Trek on the brain because that movie was so fucking epic.
304155	305375	You need a red matter weapon.
305615	306236	That's what you need.
306976	308297	I tried making something similar.
308317	310337	How could you program a singularity in a game?
311118	312358	Something to create a black hole.
312598	313939	Something to make the game suck!
314979	317880	There's nothing to create, unfortunately, a negative physics force.
317941	318801	You can sort of...
320236	321017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
340111	366219	so that's just fun you know basically you know play against each other and really the only thing only reason I need the mod all four systems because if you put one of the weapons on the way it calculates damage and physics and stuff like that you actually have to have all the systems modded the same with the same kind of you know edits to the game in order for it to work correctly because otherwise it just doesn't work but yeah it's been a lot of fun and hopefully I'm trying to
366799	368040	Get some more stuff added into that.
368600	378507	So, aside from playing Grand Theft Auto 4 PC and Lost and Damned on the 360, I've also been playing Rock Band Unplugged because that somehow leaked online.
378567	380108	And so, you know, I had to check it out.
381184	386286	Honestly, I'm glad I checked it out this way because I can't see myself purchasing this game.
386527	388367	I think I get bored of it really fast.
388848	389068	Really?
389128	389408	Why?
389948	391789	Because I get bored of Rock Band pretty fast.
392069	393690	It's just not the same as playing Rock Band.
393730	400993	I mean, it's frequency amplitude, so at least that way they can kind of add music that would normally not be in Rock Band.
401173	403315	It doesn't have to necessarily be rock music.
403595	405556	They can do electronica and all that sort of stuff.
406076	406236	But...
407685	408065	I don't know.
408465	412906	I spent more time customizing my characters than I did actually playing the game.
413566	414207	And it's alright.
414407	416187	It's what it is, I guess.
416887	419068	But I don't know.
419328	420148	It's just alright.
420688	422008	I don't think I'd buy it, though.
423509	428070	How does it compare to Frequency and Amplitude and all those games we think this game was inspired by?
428739	435824	Um, honestly, I've never really, I haven't played too much of frequency or amplitude, but from the little that I have played, it's pretty much the same type of thing.
436765	445230	Um, you know, except kind of the rock band setup, whereas you have the same sort of graphics that you'd see in rock band, except you're jumping between three, you know, four different tracks.
445551	451354	And you are switching a lot through there, and that's kind of where I mess up usually in the songs, because the songs themselves aren't that hard.
452115	456478	Obviously, I'm not playing on, like, expert difficulty or anything like that, but I'm just playing on normal difficulty that's in the game.
457282	467944	It's not that hard, but it's just, you know, jumping back and forth between tracks, you know, I miss usually the first note or something like that because I'm like, oh, crap, oh, it doesn't want me to jump here, it wants me to jump here.
467964	469945	And it's like, uh, it's kind of annoying.
470145	473505	But, um, I don't know, it's alright, I guess.
473645	478426	I mean, there's no real good music games on the PSP other than, like, TJ Maxx.
478646	481447	So, you know, more the merrier, I guess.
482258	483159	I still kind of want to buy it.
483579	483920	We'll see.
484420	484700	We'll see.
485581	487442	Okay, so my gaming week.
487462	494868	Before I get to my gaming week, since I did kind of invoke Star Trek, I just have to say, oh my god, was that not like the greatest thing ever?
495428	497110	Like, that movie was so awesome.
497490	502474	And like, I know there's probably some people out there that don't really want to hear it because like, you know, every movie has its detractors.
502834	505836	But I got to tell you, you don't have to be a Trekkie to appreciate Star Trek.
505856	506897	That was the goal, I think.
506937	508177	I did think, though, that his Spock was pretty...
531804	532965	Hardcore Did you recognize him?
533085	533966	He played Cupid in Xena
557505	558386	Oh, okay, okay.
558506	560127	Nah, I haven't seen Xena in so long.
560467	562488	But it made me more excited for the Star Trek MMO.
563069	563849	I know!
563909	566891	I'm hoping this invigorates a whole new life into Star Trek.
566931	568332	Like, I hope we get a new show.
568612	570293	Like, I don't think we'll get a show out of this movie.
570453	573675	Like, you know, the actors in this are too big, I think, to want to do a TV show every week.
573715	575917	In fact, one of them's already doing a TV show every week.
576257	577037	But I'm hoping...
579739	581700	He may not be doing that TV show much longer.
581720	583360	True, he might be suddenly available.
583400	588843	But I'm hoping that at least we'll get a new, maybe something in the next generation canon.
589483	590963	Something after that.
591444	592604	I just don't want another prequel.
592644	593744	I'd like to see something later.
593824	595185	Well, this isn't a prequel.
596145	598066	I don't want to spoilery, but you know what I mean.
598406	600147	I know, I know.
601347	604709	I think there's enough out there now that you can say it's a franchise reboot.
605229	605369	Yeah.
606182	606722	That's for sure.
606822	607443	That's for sure.
608143	608923	It's very interesting.
608944	614706	They're talking about that possibly in the sequel, they're going to do Khan again, which would be very interesting.
614786	616267	They could do Khan the first time around.
617027	618328	But we have no Montalban.
618848	619108	I know.
619329	619769	It'd be weird.
620089	621810	We have no rich Corinthian leather.
623164	623724	Anyhow, sorry.
623944	625005	I didn't mean to derail the show.
625286	626226	But you know what?
626467	633413	This Star Trek movie being so good makes me excited for the game that's coming out in a little while.
634173	638177	I haven't played the Xbox Live Arcade game that's out there, but the MMO I'm talking about.
638217	639558	It makes me all excited for Star Trek.
639598	640679	You're not making us a race.
641420	641640	Huh?
641920	643301	I'm making us an official race.
643321	644462	The Olarians?
644643	645363	The Olarians?
645563	646164	That'd be awesome.
646204	649587	And of course my other character's going to be an Orion side girl, so why not?
650325	652147	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
677051	677791	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
706397	707517	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
729222	741410	But they had a little game room set up, and I got to play some of the arcade games they had in there, such as Beatmania 2DX Gold, I believe it was, was in there, which was cool, because I hadn't played 2DX in a couple months, even though we have one here in town, I just never seemed to check out there.
742151	748855	And then I also played Guitar Freaks, which is interesting, because I haven't played Guitar Freaks in a very long time.
749236	753679	Like, the last time I remember actually playing Guitar Freaks was probably...
754259	757660	Not long after I originally bought Guitar Hero on the Xbox.
757820	759160	So it's been like a long time.
759540	764942	And it's kind of interesting that can your Guitar Hero and Rock Band skill help you improve in Guitar Freaks?
765382	767663	Yes, a little bit, except the timing is much different.
767963	771724	And Guitar Freaks, I'm sorry, is still not as great of a game.
772884	773744	It needs a reboot.
774044	775265	It needs J.J.
775365	778085	Abrams to come fix it, is what Guitar Freaks needs.
778666	780006	Rock Revolution, not so much.
780846	784148	I don't know if that series is dead or what, but it was fun to revisit.
784168	785148	I mean, it does have songs.
785548	789310	If you like the J-rock, you're not really going to get a lot of those songs in the games over here.
789710	792311	But yeah, Guitar Freaks, stick a fork in it.
792391	793152	It's pretty much done.
793352	794072	It needs a reboot.
794132	796053	Like most Bomani games right now need a reboot.
796333	796693	J.J.
796793	800015	Abrams needs to go work for Konami and reboot everything over there, I think.
801275	802296	Except for Metal Gear Solid.
802316	803936	That franchise is doing alright still.
805197	807078	He should be directing the Metal Gear Solid movie.
808720	811042	That would be amazing, but you know that guy is going to be in demand now.
811482	812823	So dream on on that one.
813283	814624	Alright, let's see.
814664	816465	What else did I play at the con?
816485	823690	I watched people playing In The Groove 2 and Pump It Up NX and DDR, but there were so many people playing all those games.
824110	828033	I was a little disappointed by their console showing though, especially the first night.
828133	829894	Like half their TVs weren't even on.
830254	834337	And I was like, how did they not have Tatsunoko vs. Capcom at an anime convention?
834357	835878	Of course they had it by Saturday night, but...
836258	837859	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
857427	862271	Organized this whole thing amongst a lot of folks that she knew and just what have you.
863032	864132	Kind of like friends of friends.
864212	865614	And there were nine of us in a room.
865874	874120	But what was cool about that is one night we had Street Fighter IV going on the TV in the hotel room, which was a Plasma HD TV.
874140	876322	It was a nice TV because this is the Hyatt.
876342	877223	It was a pretty nice hotel.
877583	882387	So we hooked up two arcade sticks to the TV and just had a ball with it.
882447	883147	It was a lot of fun.
883287	886190	And congrats, by the way, to OL Army member...
886610	889456	Rob D for winning the Street Fighter 4 tournament at ASEN.
890218	890839	Very nice work.
891766	892827	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
917048	918208	DarkSakura, you have housekeeping tonight.
918228	919409	Yeah, we had... Didn't he also win the TurboGrafx?
945325	949266	He did, and I wasn't able to take that to him, but... Yeah, because I can't find it.
949686	950006	Uh-oh.
950526	953047	Well, no, it's just, I mean, you see how much stuff I have.
953627	954788	I have an idea where it is.
954828	957468	Trust me, as soon as I locate the TurboGrafx, it's yours.
958029	960429	Otherwise, I was saying it's Saturn with no cords.
960849	962630	Yeah, well, maybe we can get that away in a future show.
963390	964750	I think I have spare hookups.
964870	968351	He actually asked me about it, but I was like, oh, she didn't have a chance to see me.
968371	968932	He understood.
968972	971272	He knew you'd been busy, so he knows.
971292	971632	He'll get it.
972393	973713	Pulling my brain out through my ears.
974227	975267	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1000054	1001175	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1024554	1027502	Stuff is just spilling out and we have lots of E3 rumors.
1027822	1028765	But first, some facts.
1028925	1031572	And Loki's going to start us off with the cold, hard facts tonight.
1031823	1038085	In fact, Duke Nukem Forever is still not out, and this isn't helping.
1038645	1045286	3D Realms, the developer of said game, is actually, or I should say publishing said game, is no longer around.
1045566	1057009	They've actually shut down and have ceased to operate due to funding issues, and apparently Apogee Software has also laid off all the staff.
1057689	1060930	That probably doesn't help the game come out any sooner now, when you think about it.
1062188	1075260	And then, on top of all that, you may not know this, but Take-Two was apparently financing Duke Nukem Forever and had invested approximately $12 million, according to Take-Two.
1076081	1083388	And according to Scott Miller at 3D Realms, of course, they're saying that they never received any of that money.
1084463	1086026	and of course the game's not done yet.
1086747	1094521	So now Take-Two has actually filed a lawsuit against the former 3D Realms members.
1095815	1097876	and demanding that they get their source code.
1098076	1104218	Kind of sounds like a whole lot of stuff that was going on with Scratch and DJ Hero.
1104698	1111060	But hopefully, if they do finally turn over that source code to Take-Two, the game will actually be finished.
1111640	1116842	And, you know, Take-Two makes some pretty awesome games, so that could be good.
1117642	1120743	Definitely would come out a lot sooner than, say, ten years.
1121583	1122403	Or more than ten years.
1122564	1123944	God, I don't even know how many years it is now.
1124929	1129175	well sorry to hear it 3D Realms it's been forever this salutes for you
1133775	1136076	No, but that does suck because it is people's jobs and things.
1136136	1144599	But this is one of those things that when it was announced, I don't know about you guys, but when I heard the news, I was kind of like, I'm kind of surprised this didn't happen sooner.
1144999	1160824	And I don't mean to sound insensitive, but in this economy, when we've seen what's been happening to studios left and right, I was kind of surprised that when I heard this news, I was like, oh yeah, how did this studio that had a game that's been in development for like 12 years survive as long as they've had?
1160884	1161344	You know what I mean?
1162383	1163164	Thanks for watching!
1181246	1181526	I don't know.
1199822	1200622	I swear it's Elvis.
1226345	1227306	Well, or Tupac.
1227646	1232329	Loki, in your, you know, expert opinion, I use that term loosely, what do you think?
1232369	1237433	Do you think we're ever going to see this game, or is it now officially deader than a doornail, we're never going to see it?
1237693	1251403	Uh, no, I think that we'll see this game, because Take-Two's got money, and they want another franchise that's going to do well, and Duke Nukem, I mean, you think the last Take-Two thing that they, or Take-Two game that published at 3D Realm, what was it, Prey?
1251423	1254806	It was the last 3D Realm game that they published, uh,
1255387	1257728	And that did not meet expectations either, if I remember right.
1257748	1258548	That wasn't very good.
1258668	1264130	But at the same time, I mean... Actually, for what it's worth, I enjoyed Prey.
1264430	1269392	Because Prey was a great game for those of us that suck at first-person shooters because of the fact that you couldn't die.
1269772	1271333	And actually, Prey was kind of epic.
1271633	1274394	It just felt like Prey ended very abruptly.
1274474	1275894	That was Prey's biggest detractor.
1276174	1279315	But everything leading up to that point was actually pretty awesome.
1279635	1281076	I actually really enjoyed Prey.
1281576	1286900	Well, they need to still have a good first-person shooter franchise because they don't have one right now.
1286960	1293705	They have basically your sandbox games like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Revolver, those two franchises.
1293805	1301371	They've got their sports games, all the 2K sports stuff, and also if they ever do another table tennis game.
1302171	1305352	So you've got that, but they don't have a first-person shooter franchise.
1305392	1310093	They have their kids' lines and stuff like that, like that Nickelodeon, Nick Jr.
1310113	1310393	stuff.
1310814	1315335	But they need a good first-person shooter thing, and what better than Duke Nukem?
1315375	1318836	I mean, I think it'd be awesome if they actually put out a good game.
1319136	1326258	And that's the problem, is that expectations for it are so high and they want to set this new precedent for interactivity in the game.
1326858	1328899	Well, that's good, but...
1329671	1331052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1350461	1351381	Let's go to the chat room.
1351421	1354502	I've been totally ignoring them tonight, and I really apologize.
1354562	1357443	Chat.OrangeLoungeTrader.com, of course, is always open when we're here.
1358004	1361065	We're just trying to get used to the new setup tonight, so it's taking me a little longer to get around to them.
1361105	1364326	However, I wanted to read this because it's something what I'm thinking, too.
1364446	1369748	UnfoldedRaptor in chat says, I heard about Prey 2, and it sounded awesome, and this news saddens me.
1370148	1376190	So come to think of it, that just kind of made me think, oh, yeah, this means Prey 2 is definitely deader than a doornail, right?
1376490	1379051	Because since the first one didn't do that hot... Well, let's say...
1380631	1407846	the whole deal with them investing money is that they get rights to this kind of stuff because obviously they may sell the rights to somebody else because they're no longer around Actdeft pointed out in the chatroom Max Payne 3 is another game franchise that they have it's a third person shooter if we're going to draw straws here but it's not a first person shooter still a very good action franchise but I don't know I think that they need something like this
1408168	1412754	You know what Take-Two should do if they're going to inherit all the rights to all these Apogee games and 3D realms?
1413074	1414917	They should just give us a new Commander Keen game.
1414957	1415838	How about that?
1416318	1423267	Since you're going to get all these new licenses and stuff from whatever settlements and stuff, because we know that's what will happen, I think they should just give us a new Commander Keen.
1423487	1423808	You know what?
1423848	1425470	Commander Keen versus Jill of the Jungle.
1425530	1425991	How about that?
1426451	1427152	DarkSakura?
1444674	1450243	I was going to make a point earlier about them with Duke Nukem Forever.
1450824	1458116	The other thing they're going to have going for them to their advantage was 10 years now of coverage press hype.
1459807	1460748	Thank you for watching!
1482648	1484529	Well, also you gotta look at, you know, take two.
1484589	1489853	I mean, what kind of idiots were, you know, running the whole process of them getting this game done?
1489973	1496236	Because seriously, usually they have, you know, different checkpoints that they have to make before they get funding for this stuff.
1496297	1500539	I mean, and how could this go on for ten years, you know, and twelve million dollars later?
1500599	1502660	How could they just let it go?
1502761	1506563	I mean, there's gotta be some sort of progress being made, and the fact that, you know...
1507822	1510166	Over 10 years worth of work and nothing's out?
1510467	1516798	I'm sorry, but even Grand Theft Auto 4 and all these other big blockbuster games only took a few years to put out.
1517860	1520946	If that, you know, so... Come on, what the hell?
1521769	1522809	Get a better development team.
1523029	1526530	Somebody was holding out for perfection and it just never arrived, I guess.
1527351	1538634	All right, well, moving on, let's go into music game worlds because it's interesting we talk about source codes and legal settlements and so on because there was some interesting development in the whole Scratch versus Activision versus, you know, this whole thing.
1539074	1549337	And what happened is that this week an LA Superior Court judge ordered that the source code for Scratch the Ultimate DJ must be turned over to Genius and Numark.
1549697	1553538	These are the two companies that formed the Scratch the Ultimate DJ LLC.
1553558	1556920	There was actually a company, Limited Liability Corp, formed behind this.
1557740	1560181	Seven Studios is, of course, now owned by Activision.
1560441	1564562	They are also going to have to hand over everything they used to make the game.
1565043	1571525	Scratch LLC says they are going to finish the game, and they will continue their lawsuit against Activision as well.
1572065	1576127	But the bad news, I'm reading between the lines here, nothing's been said for sure.
1576388	1579249	But the bad news is, don't expect to see this game until at least next year now.
1579730	1580310	After all this.
1580710	1581151	Probably.
1581851	1582471	Which is too bad.
1582511	1587634	Because, I mean, at that point, then we're going to have DJ Hero out there as well.
1587795	1591157	And is it just going to be oversaturation at that point?
1591337	1594178	Or is there room for two, like there was room for Guitar Hero and Rock Band?
1594278	1595599	There's room for two.
1595659	1601663	The only real experience I have with DJ Hero is what I've been reading in Game Informer.
1602082	1628028	and they do kind of show how the game is going to play which is quite different than how this is going to play because Scratch plays pretty much like Beatmania but now they have a more enhanced scratching system and that kind of stuff and you can do a little bit of improv but when you look at the two games clearly, and I hate to say this, clearly DJ Hero is actually kind of changing the way you play the game and more innovative in that sense
1629755	1631136	But, I don't know.
1631316	1632738	I mean, yeah, it does suck.
1632838	1639463	But at the same time, when we first saw Guitar Hero, most of us looked at it and went, eh, it's just Guitar Freaks, but a little bit different.
1639743	1644948	I mean, Scratch the Ultimate DJ, we kind of look at it and go, eh, it's Beatmania, but it's like, you know, it's hip-hop instead of techno music.
1645368	1648030	So, I mean, is that necessarily a bad thing?
1648090	1650652	Because, you know, those first looks can be deceiving, right?
1650673	1652914	Because Guitar Hero ended up being a pretty awesome game.
1653014	1658279	Not necessarily a bad thing, and they might have had a chance if they could get to market first like they were planning on.
1659480	1664403	If everything had gone as planned, they would be putting this game out in a couple weeks.
1665043	1667025	But that's not what happened.
1667205	1674029	So now you've got this monster of a game coming from Activision that's due out in October.
1676711	1683636	Unless they do some serious miracle working and haul some ass on getting this game done, I don't think it's going to be done before it.
1684336	1686158	That means we're probably not going to see it at E3 either.
1686378	1687839	But wouldn't it be interesting if we did?
1688852	1690053	I'm not going to hold my breath.
1690194	1693477	They were saying that they were going to have it there, I thought.
1693677	1694778	But I don't know.
1695900	1696620	We'll see what happens.
1696941	1697842	More to develop, I'm sure.
1697862	1700144	It seems like something new is coming out on this whole thing every week.
1700505	1703388	And E3 is just going to be kind of the climax of that.
1703408	1705089	Because you know DJ Hero is going to be there.
1705570	1707852	So it'll be interesting to see what happens with this.
1707932	1709094	But for now, we move on.
1710407	1710847	Guitar Hero 5
1738602	1739442	That would be weird.
1739502	1744183	So if I wanted to get four singers to sing these songs, I could do that.
1744403	1747624	They better all freaking be on pitch or I will not listen to them.
1747864	1748964	Four drummers, too.
1749204	1751584	I could just have a house full of clacking drums.
1752164	1752964	That'd be hilarious.
1752984	1753225	Interesting.
1753245	1753865	Yes, you could do that.
1754425	1754885	And great.
1754985	1761986	There's also another option for party play, meaning that you can come in and out of the songs as you will.
1763026	1766567	So it's not going to be the, ah, dropping!
1766687	1767707	It'll be the, oh, they...
1768411	1771894	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1790011	1814359	and their song challenges and different things I guess they're trying to make it interesting on top of that it will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour and you can actually upgrade the old game to use all the new enhancements in Guitar Hero 5 they're supposed to also have some Johnny Cash
1815643	1816824	That's the best news of all.
1817645	1822548	INGN0 in chat asks, could you do four singers, four guitarists, and four drummers?
1822929	1823949	I don't think all at once.
1824350	1825691	Any combination of five, I think.
1827092	1827612	Four, maybe.
1827712	1828393	Well, maybe five.
1828433	1828753	I don't know.
1828993	1829494	I'm sorry, four.
1829514	1829814	That's right.
1829934	1831235	Yeah, because there's only four control slots.
1831255	1832276	I was looking at five.
1832416	1833637	I think it's any combination of four.
1833877	1835759	But who knows what's going to be able to be done on the internet?
1836639	1839581	That would be kind of neat to have band versus band at the same time.
1840842	1841543	Be interesting.
1841563	1842644	That's a lot of people, though.
1843746	1845808	Well, someone did that without a game.
1847048	1847929	The YouTube band.
1848529	1849109	I haven't heard of this.
1849410	1856634	It's a page that has different embedded YouTube videos of people playing chords and different passages in the same key.
1856994	1857454	Oh, weird.
1857895	1862737	And you can actually play them all at once or at different times, and they're all harmonious.
1863618	1864058	It's really cool.
1864078	1864879	I'll try to find the link again.
1865299	1865779	Gotcha.
1866079	1866339	Okay.
1866760	1868961	But in theory, you could have it.
1869999	1871800	Okay, could be interesting, could be interesting.
1872640	1883822	I'm curious to see how this plays out, but I bet you, this is just gonna, you know, all the YouTubes you see out there, speaking of which, of people playing Guitar Hero and stuff, this is just gonna up the craziness of those videos, because now I can just see it.
1884103	1891844	We're gonna have the four people all singing, you know, Journey or whatever, then we're gonna have just people doing all the mad drumming, four people at once.
1891884	1895865	You know you're gonna see that expert, everybody in sync, four people playing video.
1895965	1896926	It's gonna be interesting.
1897566	1897846	I don't know.
1899224	1899664	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1929209	1929329	Cloud9
1939454	1940314	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1962082	1963583	to be pretty decent.
1963943	1968885	I mean, it's hard to say with no screenshots and no peripherals, but the potential's there.
1969805	1975608	It's just, if history has taught us anything, I think a lot of us have very low expectations.
1977481	1979483	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2001945	2003566	with a very big question mark there.
2004627	2005067	Who knows?
2005267	2006328	A lot could happen with this game.
2006368	2017715	But if you think about it, for those folks that are trying to find a new home, since Konami's not really doing anything with 2DX in the States, maybe this Armin Van Buren game's going to actually be kind of cool.
2017795	2023739	Do you think we're going to see something like Rock Revolution, but coming out for Beatmania type of thing?
2024216	2029258	I am actually tempted to say no because of how horrifically Rock Revolution did.
2030259	2030899	But it depends.
2030939	2035120	You know, if they put some new creative energy behind it, it's just they're so retarded now.
2035201	2036201	It's like, what happened?
2036261	2037922	I mean, I know what happened.
2037962	2044024	You got rid of all the people that actually had some ideas of where to take the whole Bomani genre.
2044124	2046265	Instead, you got rid of all of them, and now you have
2047418	2052722	You're coming out potentially with a, what, collection of older songs?
2052802	2053722	Like another Best Hits?
2053802	2054523	Yeah.
2054563	2055543	Oh, that takes some thought.
2055764	2057004	Ooh, let's take some old songs.
2057044	2058165	We don't even have to do shit.
2058505	2060287	Let's just put it into a new game.
2060627	2061107	Done.
2061828	2063929	I'm going to go vacation for the rest of the year.
2065070	2065470	I don't know.
2065730	2071394	It is disappointing how the mighty have fallen in terms of creativity and innovation.
2071574	2074436	But, you know, stranger things have happened.
2074596	2076057	Let's push some more Frogger games.
2076117	2076898	That would be perfect.
2077618	2080119	Because Frogger, that's a franchise that'll never die.
2081719	2082660	That's gold right there.
2082800	2089822	Well, speaking of competition, a lot of talk has come up this week about the different turntables between the Scratch game and DJ Hero.
2090202	2096744	And what's interesting is that if you actually look at the Scratch turntable, the Scratch turntable looks somewhat like a Beatmania controller.
2096804	2100185	Of course, I hope your left side pried, because that's the direction it looks like it goes.
2100205	2100625	That does flip.
2101045	2101946	It does flip.
2102006	2102446	Oh, that's good.
2102826	2107810	But it has five keys on it, but they're not staggered like you would see on a Beatmania controller.
2107830	2108591	They're all in a row.
2108911	2114335	Kind of looks very much like it looks like someone ripped off a Guitar Hero controller and just kind of laid it next to a turntable.
2114595	2116056	That's what the scratch turntable looks like.
2116457	2120319	So don't expect it to look the piano look of Beatmania, if that makes sense.
2120339	2121040	It's all in a row.
2121540	2128445	And otherwise, it looks like there's a little kind of crossfader, a little switch at the very, very end as well that's going to be used in the game.
2128485	2129226	Kind of a bonus thing.
2129246	2129326	Yeah.
2129326	2131108	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2150905	2151686	and DarkSakura.
2173464	2174464	Crossfader Crossfader
2192304	2205813	Earlier this week, also, they had a partial picture of... Can I say, though, before you move on to DJ Hero, I just want to remind folks, we talked about the song list of this game a long time ago when Loki had a cutting-edge first look at the game before a lot of people did.
2206093	2209896	I just want to remind everybody, Milkshake by Khalees is in this game.
2210216	2211117	It needs to come out.
2212489	2212729	That's all.
2212769	2212969	That's all.
2232296	2238819	Now, the picture that went out on the internet is obviously only half of what actually the controller is.
2239260	2245583	If you had gotten your latest copy of Game Informer magazine, they actually did a six-page write-up on it.
2246081	2246701	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2266206	2266506	Guitar Hero
2291730	2293632	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2309827	2316292	The three tracks themselves have other variations that are going to be coming down.
2316332	2326239	For example, the green on the far left, you'll see that the line that follows the track is going to shift back left and right.
2326419	2328500	That's where you're going to be doing the crossfading.
2328561	2331763	That's your cue to move the crossfader.
2331783	2336526	Kind of like if you've ever played it, Crackin' DJ.
2336846	2337607	Very similar to that.
2339335	2348498	and then also they've got in the center is going to cue or give you the cue when you can do the different sound effects and change your actual effector dial.
2349158	2354380	And then finally the far right, the blue is going to also have your cues for scratching.
2354860	2359982	And I think that might also be able to go on the different tracks all together.
2360022	2362023	I'm not sure if it's just limited to those.
2362423	2366985	But basically you have to hold down those keys while you're doing the scratching, crossfading and stuff.
2367005	2367445	So it's
2368519	2374902	A different style of gameplay than, like, say, Guitar Hero Game or Beatvania, but it's going to have that kind of same effect.
2374942	2379623	And then, also, all the tracks in the game are all basically mashups.
2379663	2381844	You know, some of the examples they had in here.
2382425	2383545	Gorillaz Feel Good Inc.
2384005	2385126	versus Marvin Gaye.
2385146	2386386	I heard it through the grapevine.
2386546	2386866	What? !
2388607	2408185	Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers, Bustin' Loose vs. The Zombies, Time of the Season, DJ Shadow Mix David Bowie, Let's Dance vs. KRS-One, Jack of Spades, DJ Shadow Mix Nirvana, All Apologies vs. Rick James, Give It To Me Baby, DJ Shadow Mix
2408305	2409186	What the hell?
2409266	2410727	This sounds crazy.
2411067	2416470	Tears for Fears, Shout vs. Air Parades, Psyanjo, or Psyano.
2416551	2416991	Wow.
2417031	2417891	No, I know what you're talking about.
2417931	2418872	Yeah, this is a new single.
2419132	2419352	Yeah.
2419392	2419653	Huh.
2419993	2425897	And then other artists, they've got BC Boyz Back, Blondie, and Billy Squire are some other confirmed artists in there as well.
2426337	2429059	But yeah, the game itself, and actually, I take that back.
2429099	2432401	It looks like the scratching cues are on all three tracks.
2432421	2437725	But basically, you're going to have two sets of cues that you're looking for, button presses, and then the actions with the crossfader and stuff.
2438605	2443667	Just seeing how they're going to do this, I'm actually more excited now about DJ Hero than I was Scratch.
2443707	2448589	Because Scratch is basically kind of a fancy Beatmania, but this looks a lot different.
2448769	2451710	And it's going to be interesting to see what you're going to be able to do.
2451910	2456211	Also, they've got two-player mode in this where you can do the guitars in some of the songs.
2456671	2460553	And you're also going to be able to hook up a microphone to it if you want to MC over everything.
2460633	2462753	Wow, that sounds interesting.
2462873	2464094	Yeah, so very cool stuff.
2464514	2465714	They got the right idea with this stuff.
2466375	2467415	Let's see if we can get this.
2467864	2468364	Very interesting.
2468384	2470606	Are you trying to get Shermie to meow on mic for us?
2471027	2471547	Oh, her purr?
2471567	2472788	I don't know if the purr will pick up.
2472828	2474069	That mic's probably not sensitive enough.
2475262	2476203	No, it's not coming through.
2476823	2476963	No.
2478464	2479205	It's not registering.
2481146	2489252	Definitely, definitely, I'd say if anything, go to your bookstore, Barnes & Noble or whatever.
2489732	2497178	Just pick up a copy of the new Game of Thrones magazine or just browse through it and at least check out the section that they have on DJ Hero.
2497198	2500680	It's actually very interesting seeing as they haven't shown anything really yet for it.
2500960	2502501	I'm sure we're going to see a lot more out of E3
2503442	2505726	And I think it's going to be really fun to check out.
2505846	2508551	And yeah, it is another thing you've got to buy, another instrument.
2508651	2515903	But looking at this, though, I don't see how they're really going to add anything to this beyond just the turntable and really...
2517468	2520450	You can't play this game two player with two turntables yet.
2521010	2521830	Maybe that's for the next game.
2521850	2522571	Maybe for the next game.
2522971	2524892	But right now it's just one turntable.
2525052	2527813	By the way, the chat is saying I'm on crack and that they could hear the purr.
2528074	2528594	So there you go.
2528634	2530475	Shermie did make a cameo on the show.
2530555	2532556	Although no lights came on on the mixing board.
2532856	2534297	Yeah, I saw the move.
2534777	2536918	Oh, maybe that knob is in the way.
2536938	2537758	I can't see it very well.
2537838	2538079	Anyway.
2538179	2538919	He said knob.
2539039	2541641	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with a trip to the UK?
2557972	2559713	Well, we have a few things.
2559833	2563715	The 19th Warrior Epic for PC, and then a bunch of stuff for the 22nd.
2564215	2577582	Big Family Games on Wii, Terminator Salvation for PC, UFC 2009 Undisputed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Bionic Commando for the same two, Pokemon Platinum for DS, and Steel Princess.
2577822	2579703	Is this a typo?
2580564	2581424	I found a typo.
2582045	2582205	Why?
2583204	2586327	Is Steel Princess supposed to be as in the act of theft or as in metal?
2587128	2588089	As in the act of theft.
2588149	2589491	Okay, never mind that it's not a typo.
2590972	2591152	Yeah.
2592313	2593294	It's supposed to be funny.
2593975	2596157	Like that.
2596538	2598760	Is that like kidnapping the princess or what happens there?
2598980	2600882	No, I think the princess is a thief.
2601503	2602483	Oh, okay.
2602584	2603224	Sort of like Zelda?
2603244	2604485	I'm going to find out.
2604686	2604806	Maybe.
2604826	2604926	Maybe.
2605814	2606754	That was chic.
2606814	2608074	Well, you know what I mean.
2608415	2608895	Same thing.
2609015	2609735	Oops, spoiler.
2610375	2610655	Oops.
2610955	2612355	Oh no, I did not know that.
2612675	2615116	Because I've never played Smash Brothers before.
2615136	2616856	Interesting looking puzzle platformer.
2618917	2619997	And you can have a map maker.
2621317	2621897	It looks cute.
2622498	2623458	Alright, let's move on.
2623518	2624338	Traveling the world.
2624358	2625038	How about the US?
2625658	2625938	US.
2626038	2628559	We've got actually quite a bit of stuff coming out this week.
2629619	2632120	On PC, Hinterland Orc Lords.
2632260	2633520	Never heard of that, but...
2636852	2638733	Puzzle Kingdoms on the Wii.
2638773	2644895	That's a rip-off of Puzzle Quest, but it's done by the same developer, so they're ripping off themselves.
2644915	2645975	So they're ripping off themselves.
2646395	2647296	Well, that's okay, right?
2647356	2647876	Yeah, that's alright.
2648416	2652338	Bionic Commando on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
2653138	2654098	No word on PC.
2654118	2655879	I can't remember if that's coming out at the same time.
2656579	2657540	Punch-Out this week.
2657620	2658480	Big game on the Wii.
2658800	2659600	That'll be fun.
2660421	2663202	If you're into some movie games, Terminator Salvation.
2663382	2663662	Is it?
2664969	2667031	I don't know, I'm a little skeptical about Punch-Out!!
2667071	2670113	I'm sorry, I'm derailing the train, but Loki, is it?
2670173	2673016	Do you really think it's going to be great, or do you think it's going to be a little cheesy?
2673036	2675137	I think it's going to be about as good as the first Punch-Out!!
2676519	2678020	But I love the first Punch-Out!!
2678040	2684065	Exactly, and basically they brought all the graphics up to date, and they gave you the first Punch-Out!!
2684105	2686467	again, with some other bells and whistles.
2686827	2688829	Alright, we'll see, we'll see.
2688869	2689910	I'm a little skeptical.
2690330	2692732	I want to demo it before I buy it, that's for sure.
2693278	2697180	Terminator Salvation coming out on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
2697620	2700321	Also done by the same developers as Bionic Commando.
2701462	2704003	Boom Blox, Bash Party coming out on the Wii.
2704063	2706984	Kind of a reissue there with extra puzzles.
2707724	2711406	Tournament Pool coming out on the Wii, your generic billiards game.
2712707	2713247	Yu-Gi-Oh!
2713287	2715668	Stardust Accelerator World Championship 2009.
2716008	2717269	Here's what Konami's working on.
2717809	2718589	More Yu-Gi-Oh!
2718629	2718989	games.
2720190	2721430	EA Sports Active.
2721571	2722291	Hey, they sell...
2723578	2743435	brand new fitness game from EA hoping to capitalize on the whole wheat fit craze although this does have like an elastic resistance band with it so you can actually do some pretty good exercises with it thinking about getting it but probably won't use it Jagged Alliance for the DS and talking about an old game ported over
2744386	2751157	Rock Band, Classic Rock Track Pack coming out on all four systems UFC 2009 Undisputed coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360
2757225	2760107	Space Camp, coming out on DS and on the Wii.
2760187	2760947	Like the 80s movie?
2760987	2762709	No, not based off the 80s movie.
2762729	2764550	Damn it, why can't it be?
2764970	2766511	I know, that would be an awesome game.
2766891	2769193	Just another party game from Activision.
2769753	2770094	Sorry.
2770954	2772175	You can pretend, I guess.
2772996	2775657	Poochie Poochie Virus, coming out on Nintendo DS.
2776158	2777939	Is that a sexually transmitted disease?
2778059	2778619	I don't know.
2781203	2781944	Don't sleep with her.
2782304	2785629	She's got Poochie Poochie Virus.
2785950	2788654	It's an STD transmitted by Charo.
2788674	2790336	Yeah, that's what Charo got on the love boat.
2790376	2791378	Poochie Poochie Virus.
2793553	2794714	Xtreme Yu-Gi-Oh!
2795134	2796115	If you're extremely nerdy.
2810425	2810765	I don't know.
2811285	2812886	I can't follow the Yu-Gi-Oh stuff.
2813366	2814446	Never got into the card games.
2816186	2817947	Party Pigs Farmyard Games.
2818567	2824248	Yes, it's a barnyard themed sports game from Destiny who puts out all sorts of crap.
2824348	2825589	And it will give you swine flu.
2826069	2826529	It probably will.
2828489	2829289	This is awesome.
2829630	2830110	The DS.
2830430	2831230	I Love Beauty.
2834226	2836086	How about a game called Excuse My Beauty?
2836166	2837367	That's the game I want to see.
2837627	2838727	Excuse My Beauty?
2839007	2841167	Excuse My Beauty, officer.
2841267	2842608	I'll go over to Arizona, I swear.
2842928	2848869	If you haven't seen that YouTube, after you're done listening to the show tonight, please go to YouTube, do yourself a favor and look up Excuse My Beauty.
2848929	2850529	It's the funniest cops you'll ever see.
2850989	2854110	And coming along with that, Imagine Makeup Artist.
2855710	2856090	Awesome.
2857111	2858911	And that's, of course, on the DS.
2860311	2862312	Because, of course, you need beauty to be excused.
2862672	2863292	Exactly.
2863312	2863692	This is the best
2865443	2867404	And then we've got some other cool stuff.
2868345	2870626	The Munchables, which is coming out on the Wii.
2870666	2874187	This is the game that's from Namco that's sort of like Katamari.
2874667	2876748	Because there's a lot of games sort of like Katamari.
2876788	2882091	But you basically are an alien that's eating these food-themed alien invaders.
2882671	2887733	And as you eat more of them, you get bigger and you can eat bigger creatures and so on and so forth.
2888794	2889454	This is kind of neat.
2890275	2890435	And...
2891696	2892336	Let's see here.
2893136	2895437	Finally... Oh, actually, that's it.
2896917	2897217	Great.
2897377	2902558	Let's move on to Japan now and talk about the Japanese release dates, where I mispronounced the release names horribly.
2902638	2903238	Yay!
2904038	2905118	Actually, this one will be easy, though.
2905178	2905859	Mass Effect.
2906079	2906779	I can pronounce that.
2906839	2909899	That comes out in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.
2910239	2919321	That will be the localized version of Mass Effect, which of course came out here quite a while ago, but they've taken some time to make it special for the Japanese, and that will finally be making its way out this week.
2919821	2931389	If you're a PlayStation 3 owner, not a lot for you, except UFC 2009 Undisputed will make its way to Asian regions, at least, as does Bionic Commando, but not technically a Japanese release.
2931409	2935652	You don't get anything on the PlayStation 3 in Japan locally until next week.
2936152	2940955	But on the Nintendo Wii, you have Tact of Magic is a game you have to look forward to.
2941375	2944137	It is coming out from Nintendo themselves, is the game.
2945098	2947940	It is looking to be some type of RPG.
2949821	2950442	Something else.
2951524	2953246	It doesn't look like it's based off an anime or anything.
2953286	2955950	I'm not sure if that's something else here.
2955970	2957172	Does that look familiar to you, Loki?
2957513	2958674	The artwork does not look familiar.
2958714	2960056	I don't know if it's a new IP or what.
2960677	2962520	But that is coming out on the Wii from Nintendo.
2962640	2963502	Tact of Magic.
2964423	2965565	But it may not be an anime.
2966198	2969339	Right now doesn't mean they won't become an anime later on.
2969639	2971519	Somebody in the chat room may be able to enhance on that.
2971619	2973680	Nothing on the PlayStation 2 either.
2974000	2983142	However, the Nintendo DS does see a few releases this week, including Happy Star Band comes out this week, as well as some new cases and things for the DS if that's something you're into.
2983562	2987503	Another simple DS game, this time series number 48.
2987643	2987804	Wow.
2990364	3000210	And then, let's see, also Ora ga Ome o Mamoru comes out this week from Idea Factory, which is an action game.
3000471	3001911	Something like Protecting Something?
3002011	3004693	I Will Protect You is the English translation of that game.
3005794	3006494	Comes out this week.
3008075	3011257	Lastly, looking at the PSP, it looks to be kind of a slow week.
3011297	3013678	I don't know if we're getting anything on the PSP this week.
3015039	3017121	Well, you do get SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.
3018360	3020323	and Space Invaders Extreme gets a price cut.
3020363	3021604	So that's some good news on the PSP.
3021664	3031196	I bet some folks might even import that SNK Classic 1 that has King of Fighters 94, King of Monsters, Metal Slug, Last Resort.
3031236	3032918	I would hope not since it's already come out.
3033619	3034961	So, there you go.
3035882	3038105	Well, there might be at least... We have a couple listeners in Japan.
3038146	3040108	Maybe they're going to pick that up for their local version.
3040228	3040569	We'll see.
3041290	3041630	There you go.
3041670	3042632	That's what's coming out in Japan.
3042692	3046196	Let's get back into some gaming news before we get to the end of Part A with the Classic Game of the Week.
3046357	3047658	But first, some news.
3048299	3050162	Dark Sakura has some exciting news, right?
3050544	3064223	Well, um, there is a, uh, issue of Nintendo Power Out that's saying that a particular game that, uh, a lot of people have been importing is going to be coming out in the U.S., and that is Totsunoko vs. Capcom.
3065224	3065304	Um...
3065925	3081357	The issue is saying that it is definitely headed out, that Capcom has been attempting to bring it out to North America, but I'm still sort of... I mean, then again, it's Nintendo's official magazine.
3081377	3081877	Wait, wait, wait.
3081997	3082738	Nintendo Power?
3082818	3083399	What's that?
3083459	3085120	I've never heard of Nintendo Power.
3085540	3086361	That sounds fake.
3086841	3092866	Well, maybe people are thinking it's a Photoshop picture, but I mean, this is going to be proven or disproven in a couple days when the issue actually comes out, right?
3093696	3095578	Yeah, I mean, we'll find out for sure.
3096258	3100602	In fact, it says it's page 46, so look and see if it's page 46.
3102383	3111330	I'm looking this over, by the way, just with a very critical eye, and let me see if I can't make this a little bit larger.
3113514	3117379	What was preventing the game from coming out here in the first place?
3117459	3118140	Licensing, right?
3118160	3120983	Because the licensing in America lies with all these different companies.
3121043	3123486	But if they see the demands there, they're going to let it come out.
3123746	3126510	Do you think, though, maybe some characters might get cut?
3126710	3128392	Maybe that's the sacrifice that'll be made.
3128772	3129793	That would be unfortunate.
3130294	3130835	Let's hope not.
3131733	3132313	I don't know.
3132914	3139838	From looking at this, it doesn't really look very photoshopped to me because of the glare.
3140358	3148423	The glare on this is far too uniform to be... It's either expertly photoshopped or it's real.
3148891	3153732	I think it's the real deal, but we need to be prepared for the fact that some of these characters might be cut.
3154092	3158413	But that could be good news for some people because that means they might get replaced with additional Capcom characters.
3158433	3158753	Who knows?
3159313	3163254	I mean, I think we should be prepared to see the character roster possibly shift slightly.
3163754	3164474	But we'll see, right?
3165934	3169915	That we will, but I'm honestly putting my money on this being legit.
3170655	3170895	Good.
3171195	3172135	Then I don't have to import it.
3172835	3173236	Hooray.
3173656	3175156	It's too bad this isn't coming out instead.
3175316	3175656	What's that?
3177031	3191772	Someone's Photoshopped Kellogg's vs. Capcom The New Age of Breakfast I've seen that Now that would be a game I'd like to play That would be a lot of fun I would play that That's alright Tony the Tiger would throw down Snap, Crackle, Pop would do like a team attack Anyway, moving on
3193173	3222298	moving on some other interesting things oh wait wait wait can I say though real quick you said this before the show tonight Loki we were actually talking about this Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and you said maybe this is something Nintendo was trying to keep under wraps and tell E3 to go see core gamers we heart you I'm sure it was but as all things with E3 they never stay under wraps because if you tell somebody they'll tell somebody untrustworthy like us yes
3223322	3224523	Hey, except we're trustworthy.
3225164	3225584	Sometimes.
3225604	3226585	When we want to be, yeah.
3226605	3227366	When we want to be.
3228067	3234313	Anyways, Pokemon Gold and Silver are being remade, and that's not a huge surprise.
3234974	3246425	But, yeah, no time frame, I guess, other than the fact that it's supposed to be in Japan this fall and probably coming out here sometime in the spring, if I remember correctly.
3247606	3255458	Blast, uh, two games we had it, like, uh, Pokemon, um, Mystery Dungeon, um, Time, and I forget the other one was.
3255919	3259605	Anyways, those were both, uh, like, around April, so that'd be spring.
3261888	3262249	I don't know, I,
3264397	3265777	Pokemon is just not my thing.
3266337	3267237	It's just really not.
3267518	3270058	I think I'm out of the age bracket for that.
3270238	3274199	I'm kind of over it, but I'm a little disappointed it's yet another remake.
3275059	3275419	I don't know.
3275559	3279039	I would kind of like to see one of these games on the Wii.
3279260	3285281	I would like to see one of these games on the Wii, and I understand Pokemon was born as a handheld or what have you, but I don't know.
3285781	3287861	Or just give us a Pokemon MMO already.
3288121	3290141	I mean, Pokemon was born to be an MMO.
3291042	3291402	Couldn't it?
3292302	3293002	Maybe I'm crazy?
3293662	3293962	I don't know.
3295689	3302095	Anyhow, moving on, another game that I guess some were born to play on the Nintendo Wii, Contra.
3302635	3307300	It's a brand new version of Contra called Contra Rebirth, and if you're in Japan, this game already came out.
3307320	3308481	It came out on May 12th.
3308801	3310262	It was released in Japan for $10.
3311603	3312284	It's awesome.
3313965	3314666	Have you heard?
3314686	3316608	I haven't heard.
3316628	3318029	Tell us a little bit what the game's like.
3318129	3318770	No, it's awesome.
3318830	3318930	It's...
3320351	3321632	Thanks for watching!
3339798	3341219	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3363888	3364688	Thanks for watching!
3391237	3391838	There's a chance.
3392999	3397022	Just a few more stories for you guys before we get to a little break here tonight.
3397062	3398043	But first, DarkSakura.
3398123	3399024	Do we get to break things?
3399224	3400225	Actually, no, not in my house.
3400305	3402427	Actually, we're at your house, so yeah, tonight we can.
3402467	3403608	Let's start with the Dalek up there.
3404308	3404588	No.
3410073	3410273	See?
3410694	3411875	Stop.
3413856	3415718	That's our new mascot, by the way, is DalekSec.
3415818	3417980	Because the ferret's at the OLR studios, so...
3423689	3423910	See?
3424793	3425074	Anyway.
3425254	3425776	Oh, God.
3425796	3427281	Doesn't quite have the charm of the ferret.
3427301	3429347	Yeah, not quite as charming as the ferret.
3436741	3437141	I had to.
3437602	3438122	Kind of annoying.
3438362	3440204	I kind of wish I could be exterminated for real.
3440344	3440624	Anyway.
3441285	3451173	So, new game coming out for the iPhone, which makes me happy because it's one of my favorites, and I have to think about getting it now, is Dig Dug Remix.
3452375	3460321	It is out for $5.99 on the iTunes App Store, and you have a D-pad and a flick mode.
3462223	3463764	The flick will let you...
3466284	3470426	Fling dirt around by flicking your finger on the screen and... What?
3470806	3473747	I'm just laughing at the concept of kicking dirt around with your finger.
3475087	3477508	Now with enhanced moving dirt technology.
3478009	3481290	And you have enhanced shovels so you can dig faster.
3482170	3484511	And balloon blocks to protect you from falling rocks.
3485491	3487952	And, hey, it looks pretty fun.
3489013	3493054	It's definitely got big air pumping power.
3493595	3494575	So, yay.
3495924	3499207	The chatroom is commenting on the Dalek being a new mascot.
3499387	3503351	Brad from PodCulture is suggesting Capcom vs. Dalek vs. Ferret.
3504011	3505793	And Actdeft adds on to that vs. Clicky.
3506133	3508435	So somebody needs to hit up Mugen quick.
3508595	3511437	We'll just dump Shermie on them and they'll all die.
3513199	3513499	Alright.
3513739	3514820	Shermie will cute them to death.
3516461	3517402	He'll purr them to death.
3518223	3519244	Alright, moving on.
3519484	3520345	Loki, what do you got for us?
3521632	3524173	Well, I've got some interesting information.
3524193	3528234	Of course, right around the corner, we've got BlizzCon.
3528855	3531536	And earlier this week, tickets went on sale.
3532556	3535437	And of course, they sell out very fast.
3536037	3539618	And this is probably not helping slow that down any.
3539698	3549442	But Blizzard has confirmed that the special pet you will get for attending BlizzCon will be Grunty the Marine Murloc.
3550356	3554601	Yes, it's Murloc dressed up like one of the Space Marines from StarCraft.
3556343	3556983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3582128	3582408	Wow.
3583589	3588011	And he was trying to get me to go, but he doesn't want me to go to Penny Arcade Expo.
3588031	3589411	He says I should go to BlizzCon instead.
3589451	3591112	But dude, Seattle.
3592032	3594393	And Penny Arcade Expo is kind of awesome.
3595214	3596614	BlizzCon is too limiting for me.
3597154	3606038	But if you can't afford to go to BlizzCon and you don't get a ticket, you can, however, for the first time, watch the event on DirecTV or online for $39.99.
3608996	3610117	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3636035	3641857	If we wanted to be super famous, we'd just talk about Warcraft all the time because that's apparently what makes you popular on the internet.
3641997	3643578	It just kind of surprised me.
3644018	3648820	I thought it would be way too saturated for Warcraft podcasts, but they do very well.
3649380	3651581	Which, by the way, reminds me, be kind.
3651661	3652902	Rate us a 5 in iTunes.
3652922	3654082	They have a new rating system now.
3654422	3657864	Even if you've written a review for the show, you can go back and rate the show 5 stars.
3658384	3661345	And by the way, thanks so much to those that have already done it.
3661665	3670514	because we are on page one right now of the podcast that makes us very happy because word of mouth is all we got to spread the word of the show so that's all we ask thank you
3671946	3674188	So, let's see.
3674909	3682815	Tora, by the way, in chat is mentioning something about Nintendo Power and the whole Capcom vs. Tatsunoko thing.
3682835	3683336	Let me read this.
3683916	3687359	My ex has scans of the Nintendo Power talking about Capcom vs. Tatsunoko.
3687680	3689901	There's three characters missing from the roster.
3690242	3692364	Two of them don't have licensing over here in the States.
3692424	3693384	He's sending them to me now.
3693445	3693765	Haha.
3694105	3695506	So that doesn't surprise me at all.
3695526	3700789	That's kind of what we were saying earlier is that prepare that there might be some roster changes, but they'll try to sell it to you as the same thing.
3700809	3702129	We'll add more stuff back in.
3702770	3703090	We'll see.
3704430	3704751	We'll see.
3705691	3708833	Okay, anyhow, so BlizzCon, yeah, I don't know.
3708853	3713595	I think I'm going to pass this year in favor of just reading about it on the internet because $125 for a pet or even $40 for the pet, no thank you.
3717679	3720901	I mean, WoW's cool and all, but it's not that cool.
3722582	3724003	Also, what is that cool?
3724023	3725104	You know who is that cool?
3725164	3725804	Steve Wiebe.
3726124	3726965	He is that cool.
3728246	3733149	And, you know, some companies are willing to pay more than $40 in the name of Steve Wiebe.
3733189	3736651	In fact, Stride Gum apparently is going to be spending $10,001...
3739893	3746696	In quarters, that's a year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum is their little tagline for Stride gum.
3747316	3753139	If Steve Wiebe accomplishes the task of taking over the Donkey Kong world record at this year's E3.
3753599	3761102	So apparently what's going to happen, the reward will be paid if Wiebe does beat Billy Mitchell's record score.
3762063	3764284	Then apparently Stride is going to provide him with...
3765944	3770967	A year's supply of the world's longest lasting gum and $10,001 in quarters.
3771808	3772028	Huh.
3773509	3777311	So I have the names of the people cut from Tetsunoko vs. Capcom.
3777531	3777932	Oh, who's that?
3778532	3782374	Um, was it Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero?
3783875	3784116	Hmm.
3785236	3785636	There they are.
3787978	3794322	Well, you know, again, it was probably a licensing thing, but does this mean maybe Capcom characters will replace them or just, you know, get used to it?
3794342	3794582	I don't know.
3795985	3798729	I said Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and Nero.
3801832	3803775	What are you QQing about over there, DarkSakura?
3804075	3805477	Dude, Joe's awesome.
3806859	3807099	Alright.
3808561	3813827	More to come on the whole King of Kong debacle, which still goes on to this day at E3.
3814187	3815089	But for now, more news.
3815981	3816221	Ragnarok DS
3831663	3834164	XSEED is having a matchup with GungHo Works to bring Ragnarok Online DS out in the winter.
3834204	3834804	So that makes me happy.
3850558	3852120	Pourings for all, yay!
3853080	3856944	I just know the first town you have to go is Prontera, just to let you know.
3858005	3864332	But I love the game, and especially for people who, like me, have been playing RO for, like, ever.
3864772	3865052	Addict.
3866474	3868756	I haven't touched the game in a month and a half, Rob.
3869226	3870527	I haven't touched WoW a lot lately.
3870567	3871248	You'd be proud of me.
3871268	3872509	Well, I've just been so busy.
3872729	3874631	It's not that I don't want to play WoW.
3874671	3876072	I just kind of had other stuff going on.
3876092	3877073	I've had way too much to do.
3877814	3886741	But the whole part of the game, the story of the game, is that you play a guy named Ares who meets this girl.
3887702	3890905	And she's a job class that does not exist in the game at all.
3891626	3893787	But she's there, and you have to...
3895380	3898141	She's lost her memory and you have to help her, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3898181	3906347	You can change the rest of your job and everything, but it's pretty much RPG with RO flavor.
3908653	3918941	DeathWishing in chat at chat.orange.radio.com live on this Sunday night is sharing that he could never get into Ragnarok because there was no quest and he likes quest-based MMOs.
3919221	3921583	So does this DS game kind of add the whole quest element?
3921623	3922925	I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
3922945	3925367	They're not being quests because there's quests aplenty in RO.
3927369	3928670	Is that something they added later?
3929531	3932313	Because it seems like when I was playing years ago, they didn't have them.
3932333	3933674	Rob, you were playing with me in the beta.
3933774	3934615	I know, it was years ago.
3934775	3935875	So they have them now, though.
3936176	3943501	Yeah, dude, there's even a quest, and it's like a really simple, easy, stupid quest where you get a bajillion experience points just for doing it.
3944422	3948685	And you've got the ones that give you experience points, the ones questing for items.
3949626	3953369	Especially the questing for items, that's how you get some of the really rare crap in the game.
3954079	3960568	I have to admit, there's a tiny, tiny part of me, just very, very tiny, but a tiny, tiny part of me that kind of wants to go back and check out RO.
3960928	3961809	Play on the server I play on.
3961929	3965113	But there's also a tiny, tiny part of me that wants to do the same for Final Fantasy XI.
3965254	3966195	Play on the server I play on.
3966215	3972203	But I also know my guildies in WoW would kill me in the face if I did something like that, and I don't want to be killed in the face.
3972622	3973323	Play Ragnarok with me.
3973343	3974745	It's free.
3975586	3976047	We'll see.
3976688	3978470	I don't have time for more crack right now.
3978991	3979752	I'm a busy boy.
3980373	3980753	We'll see.
3980833	3983077	Maybe after E3 when things settle down a little bit.
3983097	3983457	We'll see.
3984579	3987863	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we got the Classic Game of the Week coming up.
3989005	3996132	The Classic Game Flashback is now available on the App Store for your iPhone or iPod Touch.
3996813	4000536	However, there's something a little interesting about it.
4000697	4007624	The game itself is $4.99, and it's basically a port of the Amiga version.
4008244	4008745	However...
4010266	4031071	apparently Pocket Gamer has done a report on the game and they said that basically you're paying for an emulator and then the ROM is downloaded independently using the emulator I guess and so because of that it's not exactly designed for the iPhone and it's kind of wonky as far as the controls go
4032990	4034570	Uh-oh, another Mega Man 2.
4034610	4039512	Yeah, I was going to say, sadly, there's been a couple of those on the iPhone, hasn't there, where there have been emulators.
4039632	4040692	Not just on the iPhone.
4040732	4043433	You kind of get the sense that maybe on Xbox Live you get a lot of that, too.
4043973	4047054	It's just you're basically paying five bucks for an emulator in the ROM.
4047734	4055016	Well, hell, that is what you're paying for on the Wii, but it's a little different because Nintendo put out the Wii and Nintendo put out all those games.
4055536	4056857	So, a little different.
4057877	4061918	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and it has to do with a really funny guy.
4061958	4065540	I don't know if you ever watched The Soup, which is a show on E!, but it's awesome.
4065940	4068241	It's hosted by a guy named Joel McHale, who's pretty funny.
4068741	4076743	And yes, this does tie into video games, because Joel McHale is apparently going to be giving the Ubisoft press conference this year at E3.
4077484	4077924	Interesting.
4078404	4081845	He also was appearing live in LA that same week.
4082205	4082685	Oh, funny.
4083586	4084546	On the 6th, or wait...
4084946	4085146	Oh, bummer.
4085166	4085567	Bummer, bummer.
4113564	4113744	Pac-Man!
4141564	4142645	Well, now that's a classic.
4142965	4143365	Yeah.
4144305	4151409	And actually, it was suggested to me by Sauce, so I thought it was actually very, very, very a good one to put in there.
4151449	4155051	And really, a whole year plus of doing this segment and you've never done Pac-Man.
4155351	4155771	Amazing.
4155931	4156111	Nope.
4160697	4161238	Hey, baby!
4187247	4189788	Hey, radio, not kitty.
4190589	4201414	So, anyway, really what I wanted to bring up about this is the Pac-Man franchise, which has gone kablooey.
4202235	4210579	Also, it is possible to get a perfect game of Pac-Man, but it was only done by the world's biggest asshole, Billy Mitchell.
4213341	4213921	And, um...
4216033	4237949	There also was an 8-year-old boy who, in 1982, made it through the split-screen level, which is basically what happens when it basically gets over more than what the memory of the game can handle, because it just basically recalculates every time it goes through.
4238990	4239070	Um...
4241371	4244814	So the game was actually made by Namco, brought up by Midway in America.
4245835	4254201	And it was... The way that the name of the game came around was from a Japanese phrase, Pakupaku Taberu.
4255682	4263307	Pakupaku is the sound the mouth makes when open and closed right away.
4263907	4264548	I never knew that.
4265188	4265369	So...
4267799	4269661	Basically, and Taberu is to eat.
4271182	4278247	So basically, the character is supposed to sort of look like pizza, missing a piece.
4280169	4282030	So as it came out, it...
4284560	4292744	It went kind of meh in Japan, but when Midway grabbed it over here, it was totally, totally, totally explosive.
4292904	4296846	It went crazy, and everyone liked it because all they really had before were Space Invaders.
4297386	4298647	You know, that realm.
4302709	4309332	Yeah, the music's getting a little monotonous here, so I thought maybe we could switch it up a little bit, and I'll play something else for the Classic Game of the Week here.
4309352	4310793	Okay.
4310873	4311093	Well, um...
4316555	4318656	Well, we can play some of his background music here.
4318877	4320838	Okay, anyway.
4321758	4334246	So also, since Pac-Man made it really, you know, really happy over here, that also we're able to bring out a few other games like Rally-X.
4334586	4344432	And Pac-Man actually even surpassed Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game of all time when it was released.
4345272	4359258	Um, so basically, we can just say that Pac-Man was, I want to say, the game that really propelled, you know, video games more closer to the mainstream, apart from just being something for kids.
4359818	4362059	I remember being little and seeing adults playing it.
4362099	4363879	I remember playing Pac-Man on roller skates.
4365200	4366761	Yes, Pac-Man on roller skates.
4367281	4371522	I remember roller skating to this song that's playing in the background right now.
4372123	4372823	That was hardcore.
4373211	4384317	Well, also, I have somewhere in the vault, or actually not in the vault, in the garage, a Pac-Man plushie with the little ghost in his mouth wearing a t-shirt and everything that came out in the 80s.
4384477	4386018	You know, it had Pac-Man glasses.
4386398	4388139	The glasses that they had at Burger King, or was it?
4389500	4390761	I had the Pac-Man board game.
4391441	4392022	I remember that.
4392622	4395965	And I seem to recall there was Pac-Man cereal, if I'm not mistaking.
4396726	4398347	And I'm pretty sure I had that too.
4398807	4401390	Well, I'll tell you something else that this might be interesting.
4402230	4404012	In Japan, it was actually called Puckman.
4405693	4411298	And they changed it to Pac-Man because they were afraid that vandals were going to change the P to an F, so it would be Puckman.
4412162	4412682	That's awesome.
4412702	4414044	You can still find Puckman.
4414064	4416186	I'm sure they did in Roms somewhere.
4416946	4417307	I'm sure.
4417387	4420990	You can still find Puckman machines in Europe, apparently.
4423512	4424593	I want a Puckman machine.
4426616	4430799	Now let's go ahead and talk about sequels, well actually the different ports.

4529029	4529909	This is just for you here.
4531070	4532191	Is it a 7-Up commercial?
4532471	4532591	No.
4534112	4534592	Even worse.
4535172	4535552	Far worse.
4541226	4542727	That's the Atari 2600 version.
4543647	4545047	As everybody's ears bleed.
4545467	4550629	We had Pac-Mania, which is actually a really, really good follow-up game.

4597464	4598825	Pac-Man Carnival this year.
4600976	4620205	multiple home versions all kinds of stuff so yeah we have had I would have to say that my favorite Pac-Man game in the series overall just as far as fun to play is Super Pac-Man that's why I was just loading up right now I love Super Pac-Man that game is so much fun
4621824	4628628	And of course there were clones like Funny Man and blah blah blah.
4630169	4633251	Now this was kind of cool, and I remember reading up on this a while back.
4633911	4645418	There were a bunch of students that went to Simon Fraser University who did Lifesize Pac-Man who used laptops and mobile phone GPS to track where the dots were and where Pac-Man was.
4646338	4650800	and it is now played regularly in downtown Vancouver.
4650880	4657303	There's also another one that's Pac-Man Hatton where Pac-Man is played around Washington Square Park.
4659143	4660484	And I've actually seen video of that one.
4660504	4661204	That one's pretty cool.
4662105	4667567	There is actually, they were going to do a Pac-Man movie in 2004.
4667627	4670168	Crystal Sky Pictures said they were going to do it and no.
4671068	4672709	Thank God, because it would have been terrible.
4673328	4675417	It was supposed to be 200 million dollars.
4678474	4688836	Um... And as you heard in the background, there was Pac-Man Fever, which was, you know, just put out, you know, for fun, and it actually made it to number 9 on Billboard Hot 100 charts.
4689276	4698818	Um... Guinness World Records gave Pac-Man 8 records in 2008, including first perfect Pac-Man game for Billy Mitchell.
4699138	4699438	Asshole.
4700098	4704959	Most successful coin-operated game, largest Pac-Man game for Pac-Man Hatton.
4705999	4706079	Um...
4707788	4713313	It's been a generation-defining game.
4713473	4716196	Also, Rob, now you have to find this because we have to play this.
4717077	4724584	There was the Pac-Man 7-Up commercial set to a modified tune like Betty Davis' eyes.
4725498	4729959	I would be happy to, but Actdeft is going to have a coronary if you don't mention Pac-Man Championship Edition.
4730019	4730459	I did!
4730800	4731620	Oh, you must have missed it.
4731640	4732380	I've said it several times.
4732400	4735361	Amongst the gazillion other Pac-Man games you mentioned.
4735381	4738662	Also, of course, I'm sure you mentioned the Pac-Man animated series.
4738682	4739322	Oh, yes.
4740002	4740962	Play to win.
4741803	4744984	You never lose.
4745404	4748004	When seven of us, the one you choose.
4748124	4749925	It's a natural kind of taste.
4749945	4751685	Nothing else comes here.
4755123	4756104	This is creepy.
4756204	4759507	This is very creepy.
4759647	4760207	Only in the 80s.
4760227	4761949	This was actually on TV.
4761989	4762729	Yes, it was.
4762789	4764311	I don't remember ever seeing this.
4781260	4782740	Pac-Man parody they ever had, okay?
4782760	4784421	This is like the best thing ever.
4784461	4784741	Here we go.
4818602	4822125	Mathman, your mission is... Mathman is not here.
4822605	4822786	Oh?
4823226	4823887	Where is he?
4824347	4825828	He's in the math room.
4826329	4826789	Okay.
4827350	4832174	Mr. Glitch, your mission is to eat all the pentagons on the board and no other polygons.
4832755	4833696	That's right.
4833736	4836158	Mathman was the greatest Pac-Man parody they ever had.
4836579	4837179	Thank you very much.
4838080	4838881	End of discussion.
4838921	4839982	There is no further debate.
4840102	4841003	Mathman was the greatest.
4842540	4843680	Forget that 7-Up commercial.
4843720	4844580	Math Man was the bomb.
4844940	4845221	All right.
4846261	4846661	That's it.
4846721	4849741	We're going to take a break now here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4849942	4853542	And if you're listening on the podcast, the good news is you only have to wait like 10 seconds.
4853882	4860024	For those of you listening live, we need a moment to stretch and refill our drinks and so forth and have a little break here in studio.
4860044	4865005	But we'll be back in just a few more minutes here with more of Orange Lounge Radio and some stories coming up.
4865145	4868385	Xbox 360, we've barely touched on what's going on in Microsoft's world.
4868825	4871606	Their whole damn E3 lineup might have just leaked to the Internet.
4872816	4879236	We'll discuss what's been leaked and if it carries any weight or not We'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio
4885285	4890987	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, May the 17th of 2009.
4891467	4895629	We tape live every Sunday here at All Games Radio.
4895689	4897670	That's www.allgames.com.
4897690	4903812	We follow the Bobby Blackwolf Show at roughly—see, we're amateur radio.
4903832	4904753	We can't speak, right?
4905553	4909639	The Bobby Blackwolf Show It's a fun time, so you should definitely tune in.
4920555	4923136	Anyhow, we've got more gaming news to get back into.
4923216	4926578	It's myself and Loki and DarkSakura all joining you on this lovely evening.
4926918	4933162	And I was just thinking, how funny would it be if somebody didn't get the memo that we moved studios tonight and was showing up at the old studio unannounced.
4933522	4934683	Funny for us, not for them.
4934803	4935603	Yeah, I know, exactly.
4936304	4937524	Funny, not funny.
4937884	4941887	Alright, we have some Xbox 360 news to get into right now.
4941967	4942247	Loki.
4943427	4947750	Apparently there's a new Xbox exclusive
4948890	4972529	Coming, and this is coming from a new company that Microsoft has purchased, Big Park And apparently they're responsible for such franchises, or at least they had a hand in it For Need for Speed, SSX, and NBA Street And this new game though is supposed to be something that will broaden audiences And will be playable at E3
4974167	4980151	Huh, let me guess, could it be something that ties in with that motion camera that doesn't exist?
4981172	4983573	That could be like, you know, a Wii Sports type of game.
4985134	4987416	I'm gonna guess yes, that's probably what it's gonna be.
4987456	4992159	Well, that is a completely baseless guess right there, how dare you, sir.
4992179	4994341	What do I know, I'm not an industry analyst.
4996860	4998561	So I apparently know nothing about this.
4998601	5001723	What exactly does it take to have the title industry analyst?
5001783	5004465	Because maybe I would like to just have that after my name.
5004485	5005866	You kiss enough ass to get promoted?
5006586	5007807	Well, I promote myself.
5008027	5008507	How's that?
5009108	5011469	At Orange Lounge Radio, I am the industry analyst.
5011509	5012390	I just promoted myself.
5012410	5012970	Get a math degree.
5012990	5020875	Well, you have to be, I guess, on call with big companies and have to help them make decisions.
5020915	5021275	I don't know.
5021476	5021976	I can do that.
5023077	5023757	I'd be good at that.
5025484	5025884	Whatever.
5026704	5030126	Alright, well, anyhow, moving on with some other gaming news.
5030206	5040710	By the way, I forgot to mention it at the top of the hour, but we are going to still be giving away that SmileDK signed copy of PlayStation 2 DDR Supernova 2.
5041190	5042490	We're going to give that away in a little while.
5042510	5046072	We'll probably do it around the mailbag segment a little later this hour.
5046852	5051275	Anyhow, we got some news from Q Entertainment has filed a trademark.
5051656	5053837	Now, of course, you know I love me some Q Entertainment.
5054078	5060002	They're the folks that put out Luminous and, let's see, they put out, well, they put out Luminous.
5060042	5060342	Rez.
5060362	5060803	No, I'm just kidding.
5060823	5063405	Yeah, Rez, Every Extend Extra.
5063765	5067908	If you want to trace back Mizuguchi, who's behind Q Games, he did such great things in Space Channel 5.
5067948	5068208	99 Nights.
5069349	5071110	Guardian Hearts Guardian Hearts Guardian Hearts
5097904	5098884	Yeah, not bloody likely.
5098964	5101685	But it doesn't sound a little role-playing-ish to you.
5102785	5103085	Doesn't it?
5103105	5103686	Like a little bit?
5103726	5105726	Like Guardian Hearts kind of sounds role-playing-ish.
5106006	5107507	Or Magical Girl game.
5107647	5108567	Well, that could be fun too.
5108887	5114029	But either way, you know I love Tetsuya Mizuguchi, so I would be very happy if he's doing a role-playing game.
5114429	5116149	As long as it's not like 99 Nights.
5116949	5117550	But there you have it.
5117870	5119710	Guardian Hearts possibly coming soon.
5120110	5120450	Who knows?
5120510	5122311	Maybe as soon as E3, but don't hold your breath.
5122867	5127471	Telltale has some new episodic series for E3.
5127532	5127772	They are...
5131385	5140073	Well, they're not saying what it is, but then again, these are the people that gave us Sam & Max and Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People and Wallace & Gromit.
5141474	5150843	But it's also going to commemorate, as far as I'm aware, the fifth year anniversary for the company, which is pretty cool, especially making it while the market's gone to shit.
5151684	5151884	So...
5153886	5155268	Hopefully it'll be something really cool.
5155308	5155908	I'm sure it will.
5155928	5159212	Everything they've put out so far recently has been pretty cool.
5160373	5172206	And also, for people who like a good deal, the entire season of Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People is half price on Steam until Monday.
5173587	5174308	Yikes, better hurry.
5174528	5174709	Yep.
5175209	5175730	That's pretty cool.
5176917	5180458	Alright, well, I know I'm curious to see what they cook up next.
5180498	5182079	That company's been doing very well, you're right.
5182119	5185640	I think one point you made there is that they've been doing pretty well in the face of companies closing and so forth.
5185660	5186260	Day of the Tentacle!
5186360	5187141	Day of the Tentacle!
5187201	5188001	Day of the Tentacle!
5188421	5189722	Don't hold your breath, but you never know.
5190002	5190382	You never know.
5190882	5195204	It's the only Luke Starks franchise, well, one of them that they haven't touched yet.
5195944	5196924	Day of the Tentacle, come on!
5198505	5199145	That's what we need.
5199865	5200726	Or Maniac Mansion.
5202686	5203807	Anyways, so...
5205734	5210357	I don't know, other than Day of the Tentacle, what more can we talk about?
5210737	5219942	I don't know, how about the supposed, and this is all rumor, lineup for Microsoft's press conference?
5220702	5233990	Apparently, there is a new industry source, or somebody that's claiming to be an industry source, in tradition of Surfer Girl, who apparently has gone into retirement.
5234770	5236291	from leaking information.
5237372	5238112	Game Fork.
5238733	5239974	This is coming from Twitter.
5240574	5245777	And they have been tweeting about different things coming from the Microsoft press conference.
5246918	5251902	Including... So it's not like your normal Twitter where it's like, I just ate a ham sandwich and it was delicious.
5252402	5253443	No, it's not.
5253483	5254563	BRB pooping.
5256204	5256725	Not quite.
5257595	5260637	By the way, if you want to join the OLR Twitter, we don't put twits like that.
5260677	5264458	We just like to remind you when the show is live and post other little tidbits about the show.
5264498	5267900	But we will not share when we are pooping like other people do on Twitter.
5268020	5269441	I'm like you have time to type that.
5269481	5270901	If you got to go, you got to go.
5271622	5272542	Unless you lie about it.
5272562	5275263	But you could, you know, instead of reading a magazine, you could Twitter from the potty.
5275303	5282227	And I've seen, I've actually, I have a friend that has updated her Facebook status to say, hi, I'm on the toilet.
5284448	5284828	Nice.
5286738	5287978	That's the day and age we live in.
5307307	5311788	I don't know if I can believe this, but Metal Gear Solid 4 Plus Oxide.
5312388	5320890	It's apparently a rumor of the Xbox 360 port with that extra added content on there.
5321710	5322391	You're right.
5323671	5326952	That's apparently going to be their finale.
5327232	5335954	And then there's supposed to be a top secret exclusive Xbox 360 title that nobody outside of Konami has been told what this is.
5337543	5339567	Yet, this guy knows what it is.
5342691	5343492	Blood and a Four Leaf Clover
5371398	5383504	Um, which may, um, talk, may follow the, um, other character that was in the game, Paki, and his brothers as H, um, you know, try to pull off a bank heist or something like that, cause that was in the game.
5384745	5385205	Interesting.
5385225	5393530	Um, the, a new Peter Milano, uh, project called, uh, codenamed Richter is supposed to be, um, shown.
5393970	5399353	They're gonna show some stuff about, uh, Forza 3, um, that's gonna be playable, uh,
5400812	5412479	Alan Wake is going to be there, as well as APB, which is going to be announced, available for the Xbox 360, I'm assuming, unless they're going to be covering games for Windows there.
5413799	5422784	Splinter Cell Conviction will be on hand, Lost Planet 2, Assassin's Creed 2, Bioshock 2, Halo 3 ODST, which is not surprising.
5423465	5427247	And then, I think that was it.
5427907	5429387	Blood and a Four-Leaf Clover
5450742	5453303	That's a very interesting title for a game.
5454323	5455324	Yeah, it is interesting.
5455924	5460466	Although it doesn't really fit with what everyone was thinking the next game was going to be.
5460506	5465767	Because basically there's a mission where you have this drug deal and there's three people involved.
5466308	5469569	The first one being Nico from the first game.
5469609	5473370	The second one being Johnny from the second download content.
5473390	5478572	And then the third one is some other guy who they're thinking is going to be the third download content player.
5478874	5505404	And it's all supposed to merge on that one mission But, I don't know, we'll see I guess what happens there Interesting nonetheless though And, you know, Rockstar did say that they are going to announce the next download content So, I mean, we kind of figured that was going to happen anyways But, you know, they didn't confirm that that's the subtitle that they had And then the guys behind APB said yes, it will be at E3
5507605	5509927	Well, I think some of it holds weight.
5509947	5511148	I think the fluid thing's going to happen.
5511168	5512148	I think we all kind of know that
5525097	5526859	I bet anything that Fluid is a very possible name for this.
5526959	5527060	Yeah.
5544261	5552512	Actdeft in chat very plainly says, MGS4 on 360 ain't happening.
5553052	5556176	That is a hard one to believe, but what about Metal Gear Solid 5?
5556477	5559621	I don't think they would necessarily have a trailer or anything, but what about an announcement?
5560524	5562345	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5580378	5586986	either waiting five minutes to install a game or, I don't know, making the disk swap that one time.
5587086	5588728	Oh my god, it takes like two seconds.
5589249	5590310	Is it such a big deal?
5590430	5592633	I don't think so, but who knows.
5594147	5598331	Alright, well, it'll be interesting to see if this actually holds weight at E3.
5598351	5603596	Because if it does, then this whole little Twitter source is going to be huge in the future.
5603656	5607279	Watch, they'll blow up to 60,000 followers if it's the case.
5607339	5609682	Press conference is supposed to be June 1st, 9am.
5611303	5615509	Tora in chat says, I would gladly disc swap to play Metal Gear Solid 4.
5615629	5618914	I wish I could be there for the Microsoft conference, but I'm going to be getting into town on June 1st.
5619395	5621217	I might get to go to Sony's.
5621718	5622018	Might.
5622619	5623981	I'm watching both.
5624281	5625483	I'm not going to go.
5626084	5627226	I'm not going to even be there.
5627486	5627906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5647057	5649378	Yeah, well, I bet a lot of folks have already been getting it.
5649418	5655899	But if you are being a good boy or a good girl and waiting until its actual release day, some of the things you have to look forward to.
5655999	5660360	I'm just going to read you some of the songs that are exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged, at least for a little while.
5660660	5662300	They do emphasize for a limited time.
5662960	5668842	AFI, Miss Murder, Audioslave, Gasoline, Black Tide, Show Me The Way, Freeze Pop, Let's Talk More Rock.
5668902	5670402	Now, see, I thought that song was in...
5671420	5672461	Rock Band already.
5672801	5675203	I thought it was too, but they're known as an exclusive game.
5675223	5676585	Maybe because it was download content.
5676625	5676945	I don't know.
5677685	5682450	Three Doors Down, Kryptonite, Alice in Chains, Wood, Blink-182, What's My Age Again.
5682510	5683751	Again, wasn't that download content?
5683811	5685132	Or am I mixing it up with Damn It?
5685312	5687094	I don't know.
5688715	5691798	Oh, Tora in chat says it's Guitar Hero.
5691838	5692698	It's a Guitar Hero song.
5693581	5697824	That's why they're marking it as an exclusive to Rock Band Unplugged.
5698004	5701266	1970s brings us ABC by the Jackson 5.
5701346	5702947	That's the other big exclusive song.
5703327	5706689	The rest of them are all songs you might recognize from the game already.
5706709	5710252	Some of the ones I personally like, Float On by Modest Mouse.
5710292	5711052	That's pretty cool.
5712313	5718957	Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Today, Smashing Pumpkins, I Was Wrong, Social Distortion, Weezer, Buddy Holly.
5719397	5719878	It'll be fun.
5720498	5722479	White Wedding, Billy Idol, you gotta have some Billy Idol.
5722819	5724820	Suzie and the Banshees, yes, Killing Jar.
5725680	5729382	Pretty decent song list, I don't know, but Loki seems to maybe disagree with it.
5729462	5744748	It's okay, it's something I'd play off and on, but it's not a game I could really get into like the normal rock band unless they have a more variety of download content like some pop songs and that kind of stuff.
5744768	5746609	Because they could do that,
5747677	5749118	But are they?
5749478	5753561	I mean, ABC, that's definitely poppy, so we'll see.
5754241	5757563	Well, don't we have Lego Rock Band to come fill in the pop void?
5757683	5759384	That's true, but that's another game.
5759404	5760305	That's not this game.
5760565	5765468	Lego Rock Band I am very interested in picking up just, well, after I see the soundtrack, but...
5767386	5767646	I don't know.
5794010	5795032	Thank you for watching!
5798546	5799546	I know that's not going to happen.
5800387	5800747	Why not?
5800767	5801627	They'll charge me twice.
5802807	5807149	By the way, the chat room always filling in the void when we don't know things right off the bat, off the top of our head.
5807509	5808449	Which, you know, hey, look.
5809610	5813331	We know a lot about video games, but we don't have the brain capacity to know everything about video games.
5813371	5815911	That's why the chat room really helps us out every week.
5816592	5819733	ActDev says the only Blink-182 songs are Dammit and All the Small Things.
5820113	5821973	So I guess What's My Age Again actually isn't in there.
5822353	5825254	Maybe I'm getting it mixed up with SingStar because I have too many music games at home.
5825294	5825594	I don't know.
5826755	5827175	So there you go.
5830038	5832840	Deathwishing calls LEGO Rock Band LEGO Fail Band.
5833000	5833440	We'll see.
5834060	5835381	Game's got a little while before it comes out.
5835461	5836681	Does it get hit with the fail pail?
5837462	5838002	Hopefully not.
5839443	5839903	That's my hope.
5840804	5843405	Well, here's something that may or may not be fail.
5843465	5844285	It just depends.
5845986	5849708	There's a splash page for a particular game showing up on Xbox.com.
5851349	5855351	But I'm pretty sure that splash page means actual release.
5855431	5856812	So that'd be Wolfenstein 3D.
5858746	5867048	on Xbox Live, and I kind of hope that it's given the HD treatment, but do you really want to shoot HD red-eyed Hitler in the face?
5867128	5872429	I don't think it's going to be having the HD treatment, and it makes sense with a new Wolfenstein game coming out in a few months.
5872829	5876790	That's true, but I think it'd be nice to give it the HD treatment.
5878630	5879130	It'd be cool.
5879370	5880170	I don't think it's going to happen.
5880190	5880991	Cool, but not bloody likely.
5881251	5882491	Yeah, not likely.
5882911	5887292	I mean, they didn't really do that with Doom or Duke Nukem, so I don't think they're going to start now.
5888629	5890130	It'd look weird anyways if he did that.
5890190	5892113	It'd kind of take away from the cheapness.
5892413	5895877	Now, what they need to have is Rise of the Triad on there, because that'd be sweet.
5897459	5897679	Yes.
5897980	5903486	A lot better than... Actually, it would be kind of cool if Wolfenstein, if they did it, was like co-op or something like that.
5903526	5906330	That'd be kind of cool too, but they're definitely not going to do that either.
5908587	5928751	Well, there's a couple stories I have here about GameTap, including they're going to start featuring some of the Microsoft Game Studios stuff, including Age of Mythology, Age of Empires II, Fable of the Lost Chapter, Freelancer, MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, Rise of the Nation, and Zoo Tycoon.
5929771	5935332	And apparently right now, the U.S.
5935612	5936393	and Europe...
5938650	5939508	have uh...
5940873	5945215	Europe is getting Fable, The Lost Chapters, and MechWarrior 4, Mercenaries, and Zoo Tycoon.
5945775	5952038	And then also, I guess, US is getting Age of Empires 2 and Fable right now.
5952478	5955940	And the rest are going to roll out slowly later, which is kind of neat.
5956560	5962963	And then also, GameTap has apparently the rights right now for Panzer Dragoon Saga.
5963763	5964404	Sweet!
5964464	5968525	However, they're running into some emulation complexities and
5969966	5971827	I haven't been able to release it yet.
5995933	5996353	Thanks for watching!
6009634	6010655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6035370	6040672	I have a perfectly functioning Saturn emulator already, you know, so it can be done.
6041072	6043873	And they're all, well, we're not sure if enough people want this game.
6043933	6050896	So, you know, if we get enough people wanting it, then we'll spend the large development time that's going to take to do this.
6052817	6055298	Ranma in chat says, run it under XP compatibility.
6055358	6055838	Doesn't work.
6056238	6057678	Look at GameTap's own FAQs.
6057859	6058759	It'll tell you it doesn't work.
6060168	6063911	I tried that when I was still on the front end system because I can't play Civ 4, which kind of makes me mad.
6064471	6064851	I don't know.
6064911	6070295	I see the value of GameTap kind of going down, not up.
6070976	6072517	I still think it's an alright value.
6073217	6080543	You do get a lot of freaking games, and at least you're paying for it, so you have that whole good karma thing going on instead of just being a maim whore with all the ROMs.
6080863	6083525	And there's some decent stuff on there, but damn, they've got some work to do.
6083965	6085946	And I hate the new front end compared to the old one.
6086969	6087290	I don't know.
6088171	6090574	I was kind of dumb and bought a whole year in advance, but whatever.
6092657	6094018	They got you hooked and then changed it.
6094259	6095160	Yeah, exactly.
6095560	6096522	That's what I feel like.
6096662	6097943	Exactly is what it is.
6097964	6101208	They got me hooked on something that was pretty awesome and then the rug got pulled out from under me.
6101288	6102650	I do not like the browser setup.
6103551	6103851	Blah.
6104873	6105113	Anyhow.
6105956	6107116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6125822	6127342	It'll look a little more like a PlayStation 2.
6128303	6134444	And apparently now instead of having a Spider-Man looking logo, it'll kind of look just like a PlayStation 2.
6135644	6136004	Who knows?
6136064	6138405	Maybe this is just a Photoshop PlayStation 2 box.
6138825	6139505	But who knows?
6139525	6140505	It is rumors going around out there.
6140545	6142666	They actually have pictures of the actual die-cast Step 2.
6143246	6143746	Do they really?
6144466	6145566	I mean, I don't know.
6145706	6146846	It might be a prototype.
6146906	6148027	But then again, they have a box.
6148087	6148807	So I don't know.
6149947	6151028	I'm a little iffy on this.
6151869	6153451	Doesn't it still seem a little soon?
6153711	6169187	Well, not necessarily, because if you think about it, remember when we had a rumor like this for the Xbox 360 that it was getting a built-in HDMI port, and sure enough, those pictures leaked out of the motherboard and everything with the HDMI port in it, and then we got the systems with the HDMI ports now.
6169767	6198802	so I'm not surprised this is going to eventually happen and maybe it's happening right now maybe they think this redesign is what's going to get people to buy it I think they're stupid because it's just like the same you know oh let's take out the backwards compatibility oh let's now take out some of those USB ports oh let's you know do this now put the backwards compatibility back in maybe you'll now you'll be talking but who knows I mean if they're going to I don't know but maybe this is why they keep swearing up and down there's not going to be a price drop because there's just going to be a new system instead who knows I don't know
6199082	6199683	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6217455	6217755	People die?
6217775	6217875	Yeah.
6256889	6258570	DarkSakura, your FUs of the week, please.
6259932	6273543	My FU is going to go to finals, sapping my brain, my strength, my willpower, and any ounce of energy I could possibly have.
6274024	6277607	I just want to pass, and I want to break.
6279288	6279669	Loki.
6280649	6282071	My FU is a stool.
6282351	6283392	It's hurting my butt.
6284864	6286244	At least it's not the other kind of stool.
6286344	6286845	Yes.
6288085	6288625	That is true.
6289245	6290126	Do you have a hard stool?
6291086	6292606	I do have a hard stool right now.
6293627	6293787	Ew.
6294147	6295067	You should put that on Twitter.
6298268	6298648	Let's see.
6299008	6301469	My FU of the week goes to... I don't really have a lot.
6301729	6302229	You know what?
6302589	6304690	Things are actually going pretty good in my life right now.
6304750	6305550	I can't complain.
6306330	6307250	Chicago was fun.
6307290	6308111	Make up something.
6308651	6309511	No, I do have one.
6309671	6310691	But I just want to say, you know what?
6310891	6312652	All things are actually pretty good except...
6313735	6314135	DarkSakura.com
6337137	6341240	Anyway, what sucks a little less is your emails.
6341860	6348265	You email us every week at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com and DarkSakura dives headfirst into the email bag and reads some of your emails.
6348345	6353248	And yes, we're also going to be giving away a signed autographed copy of SmileDK.
6354309	6356071	Signing, SuperNova.
6356111	6358573	We did have people get all five right.
6358613	6363076	I'll tell you right off the bat, if you didn't get all five right, sorry, you didn't win.
6363157	6364017	Play again next time.
6364057	6369582	But we did have several people that got all five, and we're going to be telling you who won right after the email bag segment.
6374886	6377689	DarkSakura, who's sending some email to mailbag this week?
6378709	6383853	The first one is from... Let's see, Taz.
6385594	6391378	Hey there, this is my first email to the OLR mailbag, and I want to suggest a retro game if it hasn't already been on the show already.
6391918	6392418	Redundant.
6393179	6398303	The game is Live Alive, an RPG from Squaresoft for the Super Famicom.
6398363	6399063	I know about this game.
6399784	6404227	It was not released outside of Japan, but some unofficial translations are out there in the net.
6404607	6405588	The real title is...
6406469	6414150	Sort of a mirror image of Live Alive as with the other lives spelled backwards where you see evil in the second half rather than life.
6445422	6448783	Some of the stories have a much darker tone, as others may make you cry.
6449264	6450604	I'm sorry, and others may make you cry.
6450884	6454226	I really enjoyed the story for the robot in the future, which plays like a survival horror.
6454906	6457527	I suggest anyone who likes retro RPGs pick up this title.
6457907	6460829	I'm sure Square won't mind any more about the translated ROM.
6461529	6464350	It'd be awesome if they add this game to a virtual console.
6464470	6465030	I'd buy it.
6465851	6466371	P.S.
6466431	6470993	My ultimate favorite RPG is Secret of Mana, followed by Xenogears and Chrono Trigger, all are must-plays.
6472353	6473414	I'll give it a download.
6473914	6475495	If I have time, I'll give it a download.
6477637	6481561	Yeah, I've not heard of this game ever, but it sounds very interesting.
6482942	6483522	That's all I got.
6484183	6486065	I like listener-submitted classic games of the week.
6486105	6488066	They know more obscure shit than we do sometimes.
6488407	6489047	I know of this game.
6489368	6489808	Do you really?
6489888	6490048	Yes.
6490208	6490749	I've never heard of it.
6492090	6493331	In fact, I think I know someone who owns it.
6494152	6495813	Wow.
6496374	6497435	Oh, yeah, this is... Never mind.
6497455	6497855	Never mind.
6499558	6504763	Um, this is from, uh, FrozenRay?
6506084	6506945	I really don't like it.
6507125	6508206	Oh, GS68, sorry.
6508966	6511068	Um, hey Jamie, hey Loki, hey Rob, Rob, Rob.
6511969	6515072	So, by the time you're reading this, your business at ASIN is done.
6515092	6516013	I hope that it went well.
6516593	6525860	You've been hyping that up, but no mention of Fanime, which has led me to believe you're not going this year, most likely subsequent years, which means, once again, I'll be the only active OLR listener at Fanime.
6526440	6530463	Since I'm rather sure OLR at Fanime is not going to happen, I'm going to make a bet.
6530543	6539190	If you do go to Fanime, after all, I will make myself cosplay as Rei Ayanami at Fanime 2010, and that means the whole universe is going to die.
6539450	6540030	Yes, they will.
6540971	6548077	I'll also consider a scheme to get Eye of Judgment to sell a million copies by May 2010, so Loki also has to cosplay a tingle at the con.
6548537	6553921	It's never going to happen because I think they've stopped making it, so... It's done.
6555642	6556043	It's done.
6556283	6562868	If you don't go to Fanime, then I hope to see DarkSakura and maybe, maybe Rob at California Extreme this July.
6562888	6563308	It's possible.
6563328	6563909	It's possible.
6564474	6566296	That is more likely than Fanime.
6566416	6571099	I do want to confirm, we did not make plans to attend Fanime this year.
6571700	6575983	Nothing against Fanime, it's a lovely con, but just so much other stuff going on.
6576664	6579946	I'm actually trying to save up money to go to Las Vegas in July.
6580227	6586592	For me, I had stuff going on with, you guys know I do some theater stuff on the weekends, and I just had a conflict, so I couldn't do it.
6587152	6589154	But I hope those of you guys that are going have a lot of fun.
6590259	6592161	LessThan3, GS68, P.S.
6592781	6596024	This email is brought to you by the South Bay Home of the Never-Ending Overcast Weather.
6597505	6600527	However, California Extreme, I have never been and I really want to go.
6600627	6602989	And this is my year of going to things I haven't done before.
6603009	6603470	It's fun.
6603670	6603970	I know.
6604070	6605271	So I went to ASEN.
6606312	6608894	How many years did it take for me to finally get there?
6608954	6609574	Like four years?
6610075	6612076	So maybe I'll do California Extreme finally.
6612137	6617881	Well, I hope you don't have my experience of waiting three years to do something and then finally sucking when you do it.
6618021	6618502	What was that?
6619198	6619939	Tower of Terror.
6620800	6621982	Hey, I love Tower of Terror.
6622663	6624705	It freaked me the hell out.
6624926	6625807	I can't do it ever again.
6626548	6627409	Aw, it's fun.
6628210	6628651	I heart it.
6629312	6630373	I'm actually trying to go to Disneyland.
6630393	6632656	I've been in an elevator when it fell two stories.
6633657	6634539	I know, that can't be fun.
6634739	6635320	And you know what?
6635922	6637143	DarkSakura.com
6654508	6659811	I want to say, chat real quick, chat.orange.com Tora says, it was fun meeting Rob at ASEN.
6659831	6660791	Thank you, it was fun meeting you too.
6661111	6663012	Though he looked kind of out of it on Saturday.
6663092	6665413	Yeah, again, did you hear the part about nine people in the hotel room?
6665453	6666274	That was the cocaine.
6666454	6666814	Shut up.
6667094	6668095	Cocaine's a hell of a drug.
6669155	6674318	And then somebody who didn't change their name, their recruit number 3972 says, what about Comic-Con?
6674998	6679100	I would love to go to Comic Con and Miss Victoria has been begging me.
6679120	6679881	I don't know if you remember her.
6679921	6681722	She was on the show a while ago when Jamie was out one week.
6682282	6688425	She's been begging me to go to Comic Con but this year it's not going to happen because we're going to see No Doubt the same weekend.
6689086	6692748	I want to go to Comic Con just to harass my favorite Marvel people if they're there.
6693108	6698191	I want to go one year because you run into celebrities all the time there and I'm dying to meet Zachary Quinto because he's dreamy.
6698791	6700132	But anyway, maybe next year.
6700942	6703986	This email... Hi, OLR crew.
6704066	6711875	I just wanted to say after your last show, my girlfriend and I went to Safeway and bought three pounds of bacon for eight bucks and made bacon and pancakes for her mother on Mother's Day.
6711955	6718162	It was very delicious and it was even more delicious knowing I was helping save Americans from idiots who think swine flu comes from cooked pork meat.
6718382	6720223	You, sir, are American of the week.
6720303	6721304	Thank you very much.
6721785	6722865	Round of applause, please.
6724326	6725127	Who is this emailer?
6725247	6725788	AZHP.
6725928	6729450	AZHP, you, sir, are this model citizen.
6729470	6733213	I've actually been trying to think of my next big thing that I'm going to do.
6733533	6737636	And because, you know, it is the summer and, you know, ice cream and stuff, we had this... Bacon ice cream?
6737656	6742019	We did these questions of the week type thing, and they're all, what custom ice cream flavor would you want?
6742180	6745782	And no, not bacon, because that's... I mean, seriously, that tastes like crap.
6745862	6746643	I mean, you just can't...
6747124	6747985	I don't know, I don't know.
6748125	6749628	Some things baking cannot make sense.
6749688	6750990	I'm looking it up.
6751271	6752854	Candied bacon ice cream recipe.
6753823	6754364	No, that's not good.
6754744	6760189	But I thought of a waffle breakfast ice cream.
6760269	6761209	Now, follow me.
6761470	6763191	Oh my god, this sounds amazing.
6763231	6764152	Follow me on this.
6764472	6765533	Waffle ice cream?
6765553	6777304	You have waffle ice cream cone bits in there, mixed in there, maple syrup, vanilla ice cream, and because you have to, and I know this probably would not be good, but a little bit of butter...
6777944	6780726	Dripped in there, you know, just because you need that butter flavor.
6780806	6783068	Otherwise, you might be able to mix it with the maple syrup.
6783368	6786671	Oh, I thought about waffle ice cream and I jizzed in my pants.
6787332	6787712	Wow.
6788613	6790634	Oh, I see it's the alcohol in here that makes us good.
6790654	6795718	But I wonder if like if I brought like maple syrup and butter to like a Cold Stone or something like that, they could do that.
6796399	6797900	Candied bacon ice cream.
6797960	6800122	Hitstun in chat says, this is why you're fat.
6802744	6804165	How rude.
6804205	6804806	How rude.
6804866	6806027	Oh, he followed it up with .com.
6808681	6811986	There is a website called ThisIsWhyYou'reFat.com It's great.
6813648	6819055	I'm also posting It's .com That on my own Twitter, the candied bacon ice cream.
6819135	6819676	There you go.
6820157	6821038	Alright, more emails.
6821719	6823722	Sorry, we gotta finish our All-American email, yes?
6824130	6824530	P.S.
6825610	6826271	Oh, no, there's more.
6826711	6831132	Also, DarkSakura mentioned on a podcast a few weeks that she enjoyed the Toy Story ride very much.
6831672	6835573	I rode this ride back in July after a trip to Anime Expo, and I thought it was awesome as well.
6836174	6841775	I don't know if it will make your show roll this week, but the game is slated to be released on the Wii in some form soon.
6842095	6842736	I didn't know that.
6842876	6843596	I have heard this.
6843936	6849858	I have heard this, and I have a friend who loves Disney and is going to be probably buying a Wii just for this game.
6849878	6851178	The video's on the internet already.
6851378	6851878	Oh, my gosh.
6851918	6853839	I hear it's going to have 3D glasses.
6854179	6862162	I was actually too stunned by another Wii release that I'll be covering later in the show to think about that.
6863102	6866644	Everyone, I'm looking forward to this game as I love the ride, but the line was atrocious.
6866964	6869345	That's why you go right before the park closes, no line.
6870425	6872146	You get in the line and they close off the line.
6872406	6873846	Anyway, love AZHP.
6873946	6874326	P.S.
6874907	6881629	I typed this all up on my Palm Trio cell phone just to prove that you can write a grammatically correct email without the presence of a full keyboard.
6885113	6885733	As I look it up.
6886893	6888194	Yes, very well done.
6888594	6889754	You should be commended.
6890494	6892315	All-American with good grammar.
6893155	6895395	You're just like the citizen of the week, honestly.
6895535	6896956	You win a shiny gold star.
6897056	6897516	There you go.
6898316	6899176	Last email.
6900396	6901917	Can we have like maybe a wiki page?
6902017	6903637	Gold star email recipients?
6903997	6904177	Yes.
6904197	6906118	I mean, we should have something where... Someone make it.
6906258	6907618	Like a special club...
6908584	6913170	for people who send just A-plus quality emails, and AZHP is the first inductee.
6913611	6914632	Yes, someone make it.
6914712	6915493	I mean, my God.
6915654	6919899	Bacon, good grammar, everything all in one note.
6919919	6920881	DarkTetia, you make it.
6921782	6922323	I choose you.
6923384	6923965	There you go.
6924165	6925247	Okay, last email.
6927650	6929813	This is from Clone627.
6931114	6931975	Hi, OLR.
6932075	6936760	I've noticed that the biggest argument against the game has been that it's too soon.
6936780	6938882	Didn't Army of Two start with the September 11th attack?
6946110	6950432	So it's too soon for mutual war, but not too soon for terrorist attack that killed tons of civilians.
6950873	6951473	Just a thought.
6951893	6954115	And I apologize if any spelling or grammar problems.
6954215	6956696	My power is out and I'm typing this on the iPhone.
6957276	6960058	Sorry, you've just been owned by AZHP just letting you know that.
6962537	6963318	You've been owned.
6963758	6965160	Ranma has two A's.
6965180	6966861	This must be about six days in Fallujah, right?
6966881	6972265	I don't really care, to be honest, with how soon it was.
6973066	6974587	I think we were just saying it was too soon.
6974647	6976769	That's probably why they pulled it.
6977870	6981593	Honestly, I wouldn't play it anyways because it doesn't look good.
6982273	6984775	I mean, it might be good if you want to play that type of thing, but...
6987316	6988337	Thanks for watching!
7007081	7008482	I'm kind of reminded of that.
7009884	7010404	It's hard to say.
7010945	7012126	I can't judge it until I play it.
7012486	7014989	Six Days of Fallujah is not my type of game anyway.
7015670	7020195	But I'm just saying, just because a game's always getting that buzz doesn't mean it's going to be worth it.
7020975	7021436	Just saying.
7021636	7022176	Well, I lied.
7022196	7022797	There's one more email.
7023397	7024258	And it's a doozy.
7024558	7024958	Alrighty.
7026339	7027080	Hey, y'all.
7028141	7029301	I had to say it the right way, you know.
7030582	7034405	First of all, thank you, Rob, for getting the last podcast up in an expedient manner.
7034785	7037327	I look forward to this being a trend and not an isolated occurrence.
7037507	7038047	Thanks again.
7038508	7040029	Well, look at you, Mr. Big Words.
7040759	7041920	What if it's a Miss Big Words?
7042680	7044362	It actually is a Mr. Big Words.
7046463	7052608	Loki, congrats on the twins and thank you for your statement of not wanting to name your children after characters that populate one of your hobbies.
7053989	7054209	Yet.
7057072	7058393	It ain't over till it's over.
7059553	7064677	I have an uncle, a wrestling fan, who named his kids Austin and Hunter and he never hears the end of it.
7064978	7066739	I know who he named him after too, which is sad.
7067520	7070582	Steve Austin and Triple H. Oh my god.
7072676	7080128	I'm sure that if you act in the way that my uncle did, the ribbing will be exponentially worse.
7080589	7085596	After all, there are lots of jackasses online, including this ginger kid who thinks he writes a hilarious blog.
7087302	7108264	and Jamie, let me join you in your assessment of Silent Hill 3 although I did have to stop playing it near the end after getting overloaded with the imagery in the game oh god, hell yes Silent Hill 3 stands as one of my favorite Playstation 2 games I only hope that when I get around to playing Silent Hill Homecoming it is fractionally as good as Silent Hill 3 and I'm going to be starting that soon I've got your copy still, Rob
7110000	7110300	Fun.
7111441	7114982	Now why I'm really emailing you, I didn't just message you to kiss your ass.
7115342	7116823	I appreciate ass kissing, by the way.
7116963	7119044	I know, you could have just kissed our ass and left it at that.
7119064	7119484	We don't mind.
7119944	7122666	I noticed something while I was playing Mirror's Edge recently.
7122986	7125807	The first day I played it, I was getting into the game and looked forward to playing it more.
7126147	7128048	The second day I played it and enjoyed it more and more.
7128568	7130449	What's the difference between the gaming sessions?
7130829	7131209	Music.
7131609	7137392	The first day I listened to the in-game music, but the second day I was listening to music from my iPod, specifically Nine Inch Nails.
7138172	7152551	I attribute this fact to my enhanced enjoyment, especially since I spent the third day listening to Dresden Dolls and achieved a similar level of enjoyment.
7154474	7168973	As I thought back along my history of playing games, I see my music being an integral part of my enjoyment, whether it's listening to Social Distortion while playing Left 4 Dead, Cake, Beck, and Seal while playing Tiger Woods PGA, or Korn Metallica and Rammstein while playing Final Fantasy...
7170414	7174418	8.
7170995	7174418	The occasional monotony of playing games was eliminated for me by listening to the music that I love.
7174939	7177281	It makes me wonder how many of us have felt the same effect.
7177901	7179803	That is the kind of question I pose to you three.
7180304	7183847	I think it might be interesting to hear the kinds of music you mix with the kinds of games that you play.
7184287	7189492	Actually, just to say, I usually prefer the in-game music because I think that the games were...
7191074	7194036	This is from being a musician myself.
7195236	7203822	And actually being a person who is getting very much into experience and the identity of something.
7205143	7207404	It's really been a more recent transformation.
7207905	7211147	But I think that the music is actually an integral part to the game.
7211307	7215730	It's part of what defines the action, part of what ties everything in together.
7216190	7219793	And yeah, a crap soundtrack can break a game, but it's still part of the experience.
7220513	7228317	You know, so in that respect, I prefer to try it at least a few times through with the original music.
7229058	7231939	And then if I've played it for a while, then I might try to find something else.
7232819	7233440	You know what I mean?
7233600	7236421	Yeah, I rarely use custom soundtracks.
7236481	7238963	As cool as they are, I rarely use them, I find, actually.
7238983	7239863	Do you for racing games?
7239943	7241484	That's just what I was going to get into.
7241504	7242725	Unless it's a Ridge Racer game.
7242945	7246066	Racing games, I always seem to use custom soundtracks with.
7246106	7249468	And I like to do, like, driving type of techno, like, you know, boop.
7249868	7251389	I like to listen to talk radio.
7273700	7274901	Space Invaders Extreme Thumpin' Soundtracks
7303355	7304056	I do talk radio if anything else.
7323015	7331841	Well, there are some games that just after having played them for a long time, I will listen to other stuff, but really it has to be something that I've played for a long time.
7333962	7338365	Actually, I'll do it when I play RO, because after a while, the music and game really freaking gets on my nerves.
7338626	7341207	Yeah, I mean, a lot of MMOs, I'm sure, are like that.
7342208	7343209	But I didn't do it for other games.
7343229	7346451	I didn't do it for World of Warcraft, and I didn't do it for Final Fantasy XI.
7346631	7347492	You probably didn't play them enough.
7349335	7350378	I didn't for the first year.
7355461	7356702	Alright, any more emails or is that it?
7358863	7359323	Oh, there's more.
7359784	7360164	Oh dear.
7360644	7361565	Just a little more, just a little more.
7361725	7361985	Alright.
7362185	7362826	Well, that's all.
7362926	7367829	I hope that this wasn't too long and that I used semicolons in a way that is effective and grammatically correct.
7368269	7371231	After all, I didn't used to use that particular piece of punctuation in school.
7371671	7373092	Thank you for your time, Redertainment.
7373532	7383859	This message has been brought to you by my Who Killed Amanda Palmer, the solo debut by Amanda Palmer, fucking awesome, and by Olive Garden, my grandma's favorite way to catch food poisoning.
7385089	7385849	All right, there you go.
7386189	7389091	Free plug for an indie artist there or something worked in.
7389511	7390211	I'm all down for that.
7390731	7392752	By the way... Oh, my God.
7393312	7393673	What's that?
7393893	7396834	Amanda totally trumped my bacon ice cream.
7397234	7397974	What did she get?
7398134	7398995	Bacon cinnamon rolls.
7401072	7401932	That's pretty amazing.
7402832	7405373	Bacon dessert doesn't seem to go well.
7405533	7407193	Bacon is meat candy!
7409053	7410294	Bacon is meat candy.
7411574	7413434	Is that registered yet?
7413494	7415315	Baconismeatkandy.com?
7415895	7417955	Anyhow, I've been promising it all night long.
7417995	7428097	Let's give away... SmileDK Autographing copy of Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.
7429755	7432816	The five songs we played on the last show we had two weeks ago.
7432976	7436716	Don't Clock Me, Have You Never Been Mellow, the M.M.
7436776	7437476	Groovin' mix.
7437516	7438957	That was the faster mix of the song.
7439337	7444258	In the Heat of the Night, Rain of Sorrow, and the song you just heard there in the background, Dancing All Alone.
7444298	7445118	Those were the songs.
7445198	7447258	Of course, we had to have a song in there by SmileDK.
7447978	7449099	We had a few people get it right.
7449219	7454000	I had Bobby, our buddy who is on before us, pick a number.
7454600	7455680	And he picked the number two.
7457406	7464974	So we grabbed the second email and the winner of the SmileDK autographed copy of DDR Supernova 2, this is a pretty big prize.
7465195	7467017	So drumroll please, people, please.
7469720	7470380	The winner is...
7471479	7472800	The winner does not have an alias.
7473000	7474741	So the winner is Lindsay.
7474981	7479003	Lindsay B. Send in an email that has the right songs all there.
7479084	7481225	I don't know if she's listening right now, but there it is.
7481305	7482285	Lindsay B. won.
7482666	7483546	Congratulations.
7483666	7484767	I will be sending you an email.
7484827	7490390	Please make sure we get your address so we can tell Breslow where to send the prize.
7490490	7492531	Lindsay B. wins the Autograph Smile DK.
7493672	7494232	So congrats.
7495113	7495813	Congrats to you.
7497534	7497955	All right.
7498595	7499996	Let's get back into some gaming news then.
7501212	7501812	We gotta!
7502313	7502933	Yes, we gotta!
7522421	7523602	SuperCard's DS-1i
7547398	7567314	and this is independent of actually because usually with these cards you have to use a micro SD card and you run a program on there and you update the program and that kind of stuff well now you can actually update the firmware on the card itself using the included USB adapter and so in theory this could be
7570177	7581770	I know that there was some more information out there about some new methods that they're going to be implementing in upcoming DSi games.
7581870	7583452	We'll get into more of that in a little bit.
7583992	7589158	But that might make that a little bit harder to work.
7589980	7596683	Well, didn't we always kind of know, like, whenever they say something can't be pirated within five minutes, it is, right?
7596943	7597143	Yeah.
7597623	7601685	So, and Actdeft says it in chat right there, you can't stop the homebrew community.
7603166	7603406	Yeah.
7603426	7603846	You just can't.
7604587	7606387	So, I guess that's it then.
7606708	7608288	DSI has already been cracked.
7608368	7609149	And how long has it been out?
7609709	7610089	Two weeks?
7610629	7610989	Three weeks?
7611370	7613130	Well, a while if you count Japan.
7613631	7614291	No, I guess that's true.
7615746	7617307	Well, some more E3 news.
7617347	7621791	We talked a lot about some great E3 news earlier in the show, but this, not so great news.
7621911	7623952	Well, depending on who you're a fan of.
7624333	7631017	Atari, the once great makers of the 2600 system, a landmark in gaming.
7631903	7632684	Atari has pulled out of E3.
7655464	7683685	and what's interesting Atari was always kind of like every year I went to E3 anyway Atari was always kind of a satellite room they were never really on the show floor them and Midway always had satellite rooms so it'll be interesting to see what happens this year oh there you go let's hope Ghostbusters sells lots and lots of copies for Atari or else who knows if they'll be in existence by this time next year for E3 that would be a very sad day that would just be the end of an era indeed but you know Sega not putting out hardware anymore was the end of an era of sorts
7684175	7691339	Well, you know, there's something else, though, that makes me think that Nintendo hasn't forgotten some of its earlier games.
7691959	7695721	And it's a game that's called Muscle March, and actually it's put up by Namco.
7697422	7708367	It's a game that's sort of like a puzzle game meets a Mario Kart meets some weird Simon Says sort of game.
7708387	7709588	Sunshine and Rainbows?
7710168	7713770	Oh, and Muscle Bound Men and an Overly Muscled Woman.
7714551	7715171	We're going on a mission!
7727643	7730145	Oh my gosh, this game looks silly.
7730225	7730785	I'm getting it.
7731345	7732986	I wish.
7733026	7738310	This looks like Incredible Crisis, but with incredibly scantily clad muscle men.
7738490	7743993	No, it's like... Do you see how... You have to pose the right way.
7744033	7744833	It's human Tetris.
7745914	7747055	Oh god, it's that thing.
7747095	7748156	It's like that game show.
7748696	7749116	Yeah.
7749296	7750157	Oh my god.
7751238	7752839	Ellen does this on her show all the time.
7752879	7760464	Basically, the premise of the story starts off with a football player, like American football, stealing their protein powder.
7761565	7762705	And so they're chasing after...
7763986	7769233	The football player, and as we can see here, an alien takes it once they catch the football player.
7769253	7770815	They have to chase after the alien.
7771496	7775982	And basically, the alien and the football player and the guys are running through different walls.
7776783	7780628	And you have to pose the way he posed when you go through the wall.
7780708	7781528	And there's a panda bear.
7781688	7782589	Or, what was that?
7782609	7783509	A polar bear.
7783749	7786930	And there is a muscle woman, too, if you're looking for that.
7787110	7789030	But they're running on rainbow trails.
7789230	7791351	I mean, this game is too gay for me.
7791411	7793972	This game totally reeks of Cho Aniki.
7795252	7801294	Just without being a... And I'm completely secure in my homosexuality when I say that.
7801334	7802794	This game looks way too gay for me.
7803094	7803534	I want this game.
7803574	7804595	Hey, it is, what, only 800 Wii Points?
7809258	7809839	I guess so.
7809919	7812783	And that's what, May 29th or something in Japan?
7813023	7813203	Yep.
7814105	7824720	So, in fact, I will actually link the article from Joystick in the chat room so that our listeners who are with us live can see it.
7825387	7826007	But it's... The game is...
7853405	7857567	Yeah, and there's also this particular place where it freezes the screen.
7857987	7863669	There's a giraffe poking its head out of the clouds and a pig flying and muscle-bound men pointing.
7864069	7864789	And gay sex.
7865609	7866270	Lots of butt sex.
7867630	7868671	Surprise butt sex.
7870871	7872272	That's the sound of surprise butt sex, by the way.
7872292	7872892	That's the bonus level.
7872972	7873412	Surprise!
7874193	7875033	Yeah.
7876429	7881612	Um, well, if you think that's pretty surprising, well then, here's something else that'll blow your mind.
7881672	7883252	Apparently someone's actually- That blow.
7884193	7890876	Yes, apparently someone has, uh, developed a pill that will enhance your first-person shooter plane.
7891616	7897499	Uh, it's called the FPS Brain Pill, and apparently it will, um-
7899082	7900842	I'll make you see better, I guess.
7901643	7907504	It's a visual performance enhancing capsule.
7908804	7911745	I guess when caffeine and guarana are not enough.
7914265	7914725	I don't know.
7915385	7921147	For when staying up until 9 o'clock in the morning playing World of Warcraft just isn't long enough.
7922327	7923607	Well, this way you can see better.
7924987	7926528	Maybe this will make you see dead people.
7926808	7927688	Like, two...
7928539	7931841	Maybe this will give you a heart attack, is what might happen.
7932761	7933182	I don't know.
7933462	7938465	Deathwishing in chatroom asks, chat.orange.com asks, so basically it's caffeine?
7940286	7941526	No, it's not.
7941707	7945749	It's made up of complex ingredients which nurture the human eye.
7945869	7946469	Oh, well, I'm sorry.
7946489	7951572	With essential micronutrients that are not sufficiently produced by the body on its own.
7952493	7956435	These, and among other trace elements, plant extracts, um...
7958015	7959896	Oh, cartinoids, I'm sorry.
7959916	7960176	Actually...
7985205	7991448	Looking through this, these are basically the same things that you find in those eye formulas.
7993969	7998771	There's actually some really good stuff in here, but really lutein, lycopene, eat a tomato, shit.
7999011	8000251	Eat a tomato every day, you'll be fine.
8000271	8001272	Or take a multivitamin.
8002228	8004290	Multivitamins don't have quite that concentration.
8006092	8010256	Still, it's a way to get gamers to take their vitamins.
8010296	8011257	Just eat a fucking tomato.
8011277	8014460	Well, you can buy it and they have a 110% money back guarantee.
8014480	8016021	So if you don't like it, then you get more money.
8016882	8017423	Cool!
8018564	8019264	I don't like it.
8022948	8023688	Prenatal vitamins.
8025010	8027192	Wait, are you suggesting gamers should take prenatal vitamins?
8028234	8035299	Actually, the stuff that's in prenatal vitamins are pretty freaking good for keeping the body healthy and hand-eye coordination.
8035419	8036680	Also, it's really good for your hair.
8036900	8038041	Okay, as long as I don't get pregnant.
8038862	8039282	No!
8039983	8044486	That has got to be the single most dumb buddy thing I've ever heard you say.
8045406	8045687	Really?
8045707	8049029	Because I've said a lot in the history of this program.
8049049	8049790	I've said, shut up!
8051196	8052677	I've said a lot of dumb things.
8052797	8054098	Oh, but that's not all.
8054358	8056319	That's FBS Brain Zoom.
8058920	8063122	But apparently they also have some other stuff that enhances your reaction time.
8063622	8066904	The FBS Brain Original.
8067644	8070465	Fortunately, they do not sell anything that will enhance your penis size.
8070945	8072266	That's the only thing they're really missing.
8072406	8075748	I'm going to tell everybody, all of our listeners, something right now.
8076854	8078016	These ads are bullshit!
8078977	8083163	These products that say they're gonna do this shit, they don't do it!
8083303	8085426	But 110% money back guarantee!
8085646	8087949	That's a guarantee you can stick by.
8088590	8089071	Hey, you get 110% back.
8089091	8089431	That's more than 100%.
8093096	8116783	and I'm not saying this as a representative of the company I did work at a GNC and I've been involved in several natural home remedy courses I do believe in natural healing but none of this stuff is going to be an instant fix the way you improve your hand-eye coordination is using your hands and eyes together more you coordinate them through practice
8117903	8118384	All right.
8141721	8142081	DarkSakura.com
8161286	8164507	It's Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1 is apparently the game.
8164727	8166668	Of course, take this with a grain of salt.
8166708	8176391	Konami's not confirming this yet, but apparently some information has leaked out this week that the Wii will be getting this game as well as the Xbox 360 and a debut on the PlayStation 3.
8177151	8178511	Dance Dance Revolution Volume 1.
8178731	8179832	It's a best of!
8180652	8188418	That's right, they are going to be pulling some of the best songs from DDR's history and putting it all into one game.
8189198	8193801	Here's hoping it's not just the Konami originals, because we did already have that game several years ago.
8193841	8197544	It was called Konomics, but I guess it was the first... And Best Hits.
8197584	8198745	Best Hits didn't come out in the US.
8199005	8200666	I know, but it's still the same thing.
8200846	8202968	I know, this is a little snore.
8203648	8206111	Way to go.
8207132	8208033	That took no effort.
8208113	8211517	You didn't have to have any more step charts made.
8211617	8214300	You just said, okay, I want this, this, this, this, this.
8214320	8215401	Hey, it's Konami Originals.
8215441	8216182	We can take all that.
8216822	8218124	And we're done.
8219892	8223434	By the way, I just want to say, chat is kind of going a little haywire right now.
8223474	8225836	We do tape live on Sunday nights, and live things happen.
8225856	8228318	Apparently, there's just been an earthquake in Southern California.
8228778	8232180	Some of our Southern California listeners are saying, whoa, did you feel that one?
8233221	8238484	So they're saying on the quake side, it was a 4.7, which I don't believe is too bad.
8238825	8240146	That's just a little wake-up call.
8240526	8249532	Let's hope this isn't a pre-quake, not an aftershock, but a pre-shock to something that's going to happen in E3 week, because that would suck.
8250612	8251093	Don't die.
8251233	8253014	I don't want to be in LA when Big One hits.
8253034	8253334	Fear not.
8253414	8255195	It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over.
8255275	8256156	Oh, shut up.
8258557	8259018	Shut up.
8259538	8260939	She lives in Florida anyway.
8261539	8262140	Exactly.
8262600	8264521	It was just Rosie O'Donnell falling over.
8264581	8267063	DarkSakura, please save this show from Loki.
8268905	8270526	There's gonna be another Tony Hawk game.
8271186	8271746	Who cares?
8272966	8282310	Actually, this is going to be a peripheral-based game, and it's going to be called Tony Hawk Ride.
8284090	8286431	And, yeah, this thing is weird.
8286931	8288492	It's gonna be on Wii, PS3, and 360.
8288632	8288692	So...
8292870	8293250	I don't know.
8293911	8294512	I don't really care.
8295152	8297154	HitStun would like you to know that he cares.
8297594	8297915	There you go.
8297935	8302499	Okay, then you can go check out the official website at thride.com.
8302939	8308525	Yes, and it's a big old skateboard controller, as rumored numerous times before.
8310217	8311078	No one's surprised.
8311638	8318363	Yeah, when I heard this this week, I was like, I thought we already heard this, but I guess it was just kind of under the radar before.
8318443	8321885	But yep, yet another peripheral to fill up your house.
8322025	8322545	There you go.
8322565	8323606	A skateboard controller.
8323626	8324427	Maybe I'll have to get it.
8324467	8326068	Maybe put it on top of the boxes in there.
8326168	8326648	I knew it.
8326708	8330851	DarkSakura, the minute she hears, oh, peripheral, she's like, ah, fuck, I got to get this game.
8330911	8331131	No.
8331651	8332972	The only way, you know what?
8333152	8336875	There is one game I would have wanted something like that for, and that was, what was it called?
8336935	8339737	Airtrix, the Sega skateboarding game.
8340437	8341077	That would have been cool.
8342058	8342478	Otherwise, no.
8342758	8343318	You know what?
8343358	8347240	They should put out the skateboard controller and then they should put out Jet Set Radio.
8347540	8348440	Like a new version of it.
8349620	8350441	Would that not?
8351021	8351941	Especially with the Wii?
8352261	8352642	Uh-huh.
8353022	8353802	Hey!
8353942	8355623	Except you're rollerblading.
8358224	8359124	You know what, hater?
8361025	8362305	Haters to the left, please.
8362365	8362825	Thank you.
8363826	8365066	So, it's a sequel.
8365146	8366286	Now they're on skateboards.
8366927	8367647	It's a little different.
8368717	8369358	That was lame.
8370519	8371099	I hate you.
8372841	8376864	Just a couple more stories, then we'll be taking your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8376944	8378225	Not just yet, though.
8378485	8378586	Yes.
8378606	8379226	We'll let you know when.
8379566	8383790	So, as I alluded to earlier, metaphoric there,
8385367	8387389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
8408004	8414069	Something that's going to be broken really fast, basically, but will hopefully delay releases and that kind of stuff.
8414569	8420074	I don't think it's going to, but not related to the story, and I'm going to bring it up anyways right now.
8420714	8423917	We may have talked about it a little bit before.
8424257	8434085	Kojima Productions has a new teaser page for some secret project, and wouldn't you know it, there is something that looks like a 5, or possibly an S.
8436161	8441906	So we're either going to get a Snatcher game or maybe Metal Gear Solid 5.
8443468	8443768	Uh oh.
8443888	8444729	With a new countdown.
8445449	8451475	And maybe that's what they're going to show on the press conference that they're saying.
8451575	8454738	You know, they're going to fucking do it.
8455298	8455599	Maybe.
8455759	8456139	I don't know.
8457640	8458001	Who knows?
8459562	8459922	We'll see.
8460903	8461384	Interesting.
8462321	8462601	TheZoonHD.com
8479884	8480865	Thanks for watching!
8498468	8503892	and apparently something very similar to the NXC is going to be the function that kind of drives the handheld.
8504292	8510717	So in a way, it's their foray into handheld gaming, but not really because it's still kind of like an iPod-ish type of device.
8510777	8511818	It's still the Zoom.
8512298	8513740	But here's the other big catch.
8514480	8517041	And this is why I'm kind of like, you know, very skeptical about this.
8517081	8524105	Apparently, the Zune HD, you will also be able to play Xbox Live Arcade games either on your Xbox or your handheld.
8524385	8526006	That's where I stopped believing that this is true.
8526426	8527186	I think that's too much.
8527447	8529568	Well, no, it's not necessarily too much.
8529848	8531148	Only certain games.
8531348	8532309	It's not all games.
8532649	8535451	Maybe certain newer games that are developed with both...
8536491	8537792	I don't know.
8537812	8540033	I mean, they have some pretty elaborate shit on Xbox Live Arcade now.
8540073	8544194	I just can't imagine you're going to have something with the power of an Xbox 360 in your pocket.
8544395	8545435	You know how much noise that'll make?
8545455	8546015	I mean, but really.
8546035	8546075	So...
8566192	8566532	We'll see
8587810	8588411	Don't talk about that.
8588451	8589913	I actually have to kind of go to the restroom.
8590454	8591496	And we got to take calls.
8591576	8595342	So we're going to open up the Skype line now for your calls.
8595362	8598727	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8598747	8599448	Let's go to the phones.
8599789	8600730	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8600750	8601091	Who's this?
8603939	8605460	Whoa, it's freezing up!
8605680	8606761	Hi, it's freezing up.
8606801	8607522	What's freezing up?
8607782	8609003	Are you having another earthquake?
8609203	8612205	Whoa, no, it's ringing, but I'm called in.
8612465	8613006	Oh, there we go.
8614327	8616148	Hi, introduce yourself for our listeners, please.
8617169	8618070	It's Deathwishing.
8618110	8618910	Hi, Deathwishing.
8618950	8620631	Talk to Jamie while I go to the bathroom.
8621312	8621912	Hi!
8622793	8623994	Quick, follow him in there.
8624194	8625315	We can tackle him.
8625475	8628617	That's okay, I'd rather not, because the cat also uses that bathroom.
8629658	8630599	So, what's up?
8631379	8631660	Fuel.
8632060	8632780	That racing game?
8633061	8633281	Yeah.
8633301	8633421	Fuel?
8633991	8634731	Yeah, it's awesome.
8635172	8636112	Or it looks awesome.
8636793	8637133	I don't know.
8637233	8640435	I'm on a pre-order thing here and I can't decide which game to pre-order.
8641635	8643816	It is Red Faction, Guerrilla, or Fuel.
8644257	8650040	And that looks like Motorstorm on steroids and then Red Faction's Red Faction.
8652081	8656343	Well, it depends if you want a racing game or more of like, you know, sandbox-y.
8657064	8659085	Or do I want Global Warming or Mars?
8660205	8660465	Yeah.
8661926	8663287	Global Warming for the win, I think.
8667509	8671291	On the other part, we need to strap down Rosie O'Donnell just to get that thought out.
8674932	8676353	I'm trying to think here.
8676393	8677933	A little bit of shocker over here.
8677953	8678554	You know what happened.
8681435	8682555	I'm still playing Street Fighter.
8683456	8684476	I think that's all we need to know.
8686177	8687817	Cool.
8688378	8689758	Who's actually your primary now?
8690678	8691099	Primary?
8691319	8692099	Yeah, in Street Fighter.
8693564	8694725	Your main person.
8694745	8695065	Sagat.
8695365	8696105	Sagat, no.
8697346	8698166	Any particular reason?
8699527	8701928	Uh... Tiger Uppercut.
8703248	8703708	Is that all?
8704829	8705649	Oh, and Tiger Knee.
8706450	8708110	It looks like he's kicking them in the balls.
8709211	8710431	Just way more hardcore.
8710672	8713533	I'm still totally taken with using Sakura, of course.
8714473	8716574	That's because your name's DarkSakura.
8716934	8720216	But I haven't... If she played more like the one from, like, uh...
8721001	8725622	You know, like SNK vs. Capcom with her really weird run into her uppercut.
8725682	8726862	It'd be really cool.
8727662	8729462	I haven't noticed that.
8729503	8733383	She plays a lot like an interesting combination of Alpha 2, Alpha 3.
8733483	8733703	Yeah.
8735644	8739504	Well, Street Fighter 4 is my first real Street Fighter.
8740004	8740804	What do you want, Lazy?
8742425	8743705	Go back and play Alpha 2.
8744945	8747206	But I'm a young kid.
8747266	8748546	I have to stick with the young games.
8748606	8749186	It makes me hip.
8751787	8753469	That means you're doing research.
8753509	8754029	You know what?
8754089	8755030	Respect your elders.
8755050	8755571	Hi, I'm back.
8755631	8756692	Respect your elders.
8756772	8759594	You need to discover your roots of gaming.
8760155	8761696	Seriously, go back and play Alpha 2.
8761737	8762777	Young whippersnappers.
8764059	8766161	Road Rash is better than every game out.
8767122	8767582	Says you.
8768543	8769023	Says me.
8769444	8770265	What did I miss?
8770565	8774388	You missed Fuel, me wanting to tie down Rosie O'Donnell, and...
8775834	8776294	Deathwishing
8800089	8804873	Some people in chat asked if we felt the earthquake, but we're way too far away to feel an earthquake.
8805073	8807354	The big one could hit LA and we wouldn't feel it up here.
8807955	8809776	Another gamer pill is called carrots.
8810477	8811598	They help your eyesight.
8812458	8814099	Carrots are pretty amazing, actually.
8815620	8817762	And they do have pills out there, actually, that's just carrots.
8817782	8819463	Just make sure you get the right hole.
8819944	8821084	But if you eat...
8823426	8823726	Wow.
8824967	8828328	If you eat too many carrots, your face will turn orange.
8828388	8828848	This is true.
8828888	8829928	This happened to me when I was a kid.
8830728	8833909	It happened to a famous person, too.
8834710	8836170	Did you ever watch The Partridge Family?
8838511	8839231	Danny Bonaduce?
8839351	8840091	No, Susan Day.
8840431	8840771	Really?
8841012	8845173	Yeah, she pretty much starved herself and ate nothing but carrots, and she turned orange.
8845493	8847434	This kid has no idea what The Partridge Family was.
8847454	8848554	Do you know what The Partridge Family is?
8850014	8850274	Huh?
8850835	8851355	Oh, God.
8851635	8851955	All right.
8851995	8855358	Do you have any final thoughts before I let you go?
8855798	8858060	Should I pre-order Fuel or Red Faction Guerrilla?
8861122	8861863	Red Faction Guerrilla.
8864865	8865105	Okay.
8865585	8865986	All right, bye.
8866386	8867126	I'll see you about that.
8867146	8867447	Okay, thanks.
8867487	8867707	Bye.
8870868	8872389	I don't know, I just picked the better sounding one.
8872449	8873650	I have no idea what those games are.
8874030	8875150	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8875210	8875691	Who's this?
8876471	8877772	Hey, it's your one and only Ranma.
8877812	8878632	What's up, everyone?
8878973	8879493	Hi, not much.
8879573	8881754	I was just yelling at the previous listener.
8881814	8883595	Please tell me you know who the Partridge family is.
8884916	8886557	I grew up watching the Partridge family.
8886597	8887477	Come on, get happy.
8888058	8889979	There's a song that we're singing.
8890059	8890399	Don't!
8891119	8892840	Come on, get happy.
8893040	8893721	Alright, come on.
8893781	8894501	Everybody knows that one.
8894521	8897583	Alright, Ranma, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8898063	8899564	Did you Twitter from the bathroom?
8900455	8902416	I did not Twitter for the bathroom.
8902436	8904157	I left my phone in here.
8904257	8905077	Thank you very much.
8905778	8906178	Okay.
8906258	8906658	All right.
8906738	8907118	All right.
8907178	8907539	All right.
8907699	8908879	It was just a pee too.
8908939	8909740	It wasn't a poop.
8909820	8913562	So it's a lot harder to Twitter while you pee.
8913902	8915443	And I'm afraid of getting the phone wet.
8915523	8916843	So I wouldn't want to do that.
8917504	8918284	You got a point there.
8919324	8920205	I always have a point.
8921406	8925848	The chat room is like, ah, whatever.
8927003	8928304	Anyhow, what's on your mind?
8928364	8930765	Surely you didn't just call and ask me about my bathroom.
8930785	8931645	Don't call him Shirley!
8934226	8934766	Or Shermie.
8936787	8937267	Speak.
8938047	8943249	Okay, last week I helped a friend download Patapon 2 and it kind of blew up in our faces.
8944090	8946451	Like the game literally blew up in your face or what happened?
8947551	8951232	It was being held trying to download the software to our PSP.
8953133	8953974	I don't understand.
8954014	8955014	Like what happened?
8955717	8960638	Alright, pretty much, we hooked up to my laptop, I'm running Windows 7, so I figured, okay, it'll download.
8961258	8967000	The Sony software stopped halfway and said, I'm running an unauthorized operating system, this will now shut down.
8967760	8979063	After doing that twice, we went to an XP machine, started downloading everything, it started running, we downloaded Patapon, we walked out, we come back, the download timed out.
8980783	8981183	Interesting.
8981203	8983024	Why'd you try downloading it through the PSP?
8984504	8984564	Um,
8985011	8988572	The funny thing is, it wouldn't let her update the firmware.
8988592	8990992	She was running version 3.7 or something like that.
8991592	8992072	Holy crap.
8992892	8996813	Yeah, and we tried to update the firmware, and it was like, it says you're running the latest one.
8998073	9001774	Well, it sounds like Sony's going to sell tons of copies of this stuff with all these hurdles going on.
9002194	9004194	I bet I can get that game faster then.
9004214	9006955	This almost sounds like a challenge.
9007395	9010775	Is it faster to download Patapon 2 legally or illegally?
9011095	9013036	This should be like a challenge we do on the show next week.
9013056	9014416	That might be fun.
9016485	9016985	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9035682	9036944	Okay, gotcha.
9038045	9038505	Interesting.
9038525	9039506	Well, thanks for the heads up.
9039566	9041808	I could probably have it in a minute, but I'm not going to.
9041848	9043050	Do not waste the bandwidth in here.
9043070	9046573	Alright, so anyway, Rahm, anything else you want to call in about tonight?
9047814	9056703	Rockman Unplugged is pretty good, and Rahm, in response to nine people in a hotel room at ASIN, need I remind you about Catechon?
9057878	9060260	Yeah, but that room at Katsukan was much bigger.
9060520	9062102	You had a suite at Katsukan.
9062222	9065265	We're talking like a standard two-bed room at ASEN.
9066446	9071731	I have stayed in rooms where they fit 15 people in there and people sleep on shifts.
9072291	9072732	I've done it.
9072792	9073593	Oh, my God.
9073753	9074233	Now, I'm just...
9075279	9076720	I'm too old for this.
9077000	9081524	I'm, you know, no, I mean, and certainly no, you know, disrespect.
9081564	9083926	I had a lot of fun and, you know, I did finally get my sleep.
9084346	9088109	But, you know, I definitely, you know, somebody said they could kind of see it in me on Saturday.
9088169	9091932	I was definitely feeling tired just because, you know, so many people and so on.
9092132	9093473	So it took me a while to catch up.
9093573	9098096	I was so dead at work on Monday and Tuesday it was not even funny.
9098457	9099778	Like I took like a five-hour nap.
9099818	9100678	It was pretty disgusting.
9101199	9102780	Did you call out because you had the comp leg?
9103627	9104308	No, I couldn't.
9104748	9113575	In my job, you can't really call in sick unless you are really, really sick, especially when you have huge, important projects that have to be done when you teach.
9113956	9115397	Oh, okay.
9116158	9116378	All right.
9116698	9122563	Well, Ranma, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but have a good one, and hopefully the next convention I go to, you'll be there.
9123163	9123904	Most definitely.
9124044	9124264	All right.
9124304	9124745	Take care, buddy.
9125405	9125646	Later.
9125846	9126006	Later.
9128065	9130889	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9130909	9132451	But the calls are coming in back to back tonight.
9132492	9133413	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9133433	9133813	Who's this?
9134775	9135275	Hey, what's up?
9135356	9137439	It's the Rob D. Rob, how you doing?
9138223	9142707	Not too shabby, just got home from work and I'm like, oh my god, has Orange Loader taken calls yet?
9142827	9143208	I don't know.
9143308	9145590	We just started taking calls, you're just in time.
9145630	9149093	I did talk earlier in the show and I did congratulate you on your Street Fighter 4 win.
9149674	9150374	Thank you very much.
9150614	9158021	And was talking a little bit about the experience in the hotel room playing on the Xbox 360 and the two arcade sticks, which actually was a lot of fun.
9158361	9159803	I almost want to get an arcade stick.
9160632	9161092	They're nice.
9161192	9168977	I mean, I never thought I'd be one of those guys who actually takes arcade sticks and I despise myself just a little bit more as a human being just for actually being one of those people who uses an arcade stick.
9169637	9171098	But it's worth it.
9172439	9173359	How did your panel go?
9173419	9174180	I never got to ask.
9174795	9175495	It went really well.
9176216	9177676	People really got a huge kick out of it.
9178157	9188581	We ended up getting pretty much an almost full room at the biggest panel room at the convention, short of the main programming area where they have thousands of seats and that sort of thing.
9188941	9189902	That's amazing.
9189942	9190722	Congratulations.
9190782	9192003	I have to admit I'm a little jealous.
9192714	9196977	And I actually just found out that I have a panel at Otakon, so that's going to be interesting.
9197198	9197538	Wow.
9197558	9198238	Well, go you.
9198358	9200960	I mean, the stuff I saw, I didn't get to see the panel.
9201281	9202802	I wish you guys would have taped it or something.
9203202	9204903	We do have a tape.
9205064	9210067	It's not great quality because it was taken on a really small digital camera.
9210087	9211108	I think Misty taped it.
9211789	9214971	Misty gave it to one of Jason, the Crazy Kids brothers.
9215331	9215832	Gotcha.
9217196	9218437	I have the video.
9219037	9222639	I think I'm going to end up subtitling it and seeing how that turns out because you can hardly hear anything.
9223420	9226922	Or if you're going to do the same thing at the next panel, take a better camera next time.
9226962	9227322	Be ready.
9227842	9228923	Be ready with a video camera.
9228943	9229363	It'll be fun.
9230144	9230344	Oh, yeah.
9230464	9230844	But that's great.
9231384	9234566	The stuff I saw, tell the listeners because we're talking about this panel.
9234606	9235947	Nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about.
9236287	9239769	Tell the listeners a little bit about what you did at this panel that had a full crowd.
9240530	9244812	Well, last year when we went to Otakon, we saw this Sonic the Hedgehog panel and
9245154	9247396	I'd laugh if they actually listened to this, although I doubt it.
9247896	9249517	And they did a terrible, terrible job.
9249557	9256162	The whole thing was, basically, the people who did it took a timeline of the Sonic games and was like, oh, and then Sonic Shovel came out.
9256522	9257663	Who doesn't remember Sonic Shovel?
9257683	9259204	And then everyone would go, woo!
9259264	9260065	And that was pretty much it.
9260145	9260605	And it sucked.
9261066	9265129	So we decided, okay, if they're going to do bad video game panels, let's make a good video game panel.
9265909	9268651	And we realized, what would people actually want to hear about?
9268691	9270793	What would people laugh at that they don't really know about?
9271073	9273555	So we decided to compile a list of, like,
9273908	9276729	some of the worst writing and some of the worst examples of video game tropes.
9278109	9286372	And we decided to do a little presentation about it and compile an hour-long thing about it with slides, with pre-written stuff.
9286793	9287653	And it turned out really well.
9287673	9302198	We have a whole section on stupid Mega Man Robot Masters, bad video game covers, the introduction of Blaster Master and the Americanization of it, where instead of having this basic storyline of this guy battling in a post-apocalyptic world in this
9302677	9303638	And this is completely true?
9328291	9329893	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9348086	9349306	Yeah, it's hilarious.
9349346	9351307	And like I said, we did a huge list of it.
9351327	9353168	And actually, we still have material left over.
9353328	9357590	And we've actually even gotten some good ideas from some of the people attending our panel as well.
9357630	9360631	We always ask at the end to see if anyone has anything else.
9361371	9365153	Honestly, if we wanted to do a two-hour panel and wanted to put in the work for that, we probably could.
9365453	9367553	So you're like traveling video game comics.
9367593	9368514	This is pretty amazing.
9369234	9370995	Yeah, it's fun so far.
9371135	9373636	We'll see how long we do it and how many cons we can do it at.
9373656	9376637	Basically, if you'll give us a free badge and we can find cheap hotel, we'll do it.
9377091	9378312	Alright, well, hey, there you go.
9378452	9378892	You know what?
9379012	9382275	Maybe we need to start working on something for Fonamay 2010.
9383295	9387538	We want to, but California's a little bit far away from us Illinois boys.
9388739	9390521	Take a look at Southwest out of Midway.
9390661	9392302	They have some direct flights, so, you know.
9393503	9394483	We'll work on that for next year.
9394623	9396204	Alright, do that.
9396945	9400668	Anyhow, Rob D., any other con thoughts or thoughts in general you want to share tonight?
9401268	9402829	Oh man, the convention was a lot of fun.
9403169	9403970	Actually, it's funny, um,
9405196	9413042	After finals, because I had a couple finals to take right after, I really just need another break from reality, so I'm actually going to be going to Anime North, although I have no panel this weekend.
9414803	9416204	Which is hilarious.
9416264	9417605	I'm a con whore at this point.
9418125	9419306	I have nothing else to say about that.
9419967	9421788	It'll be my first trip to Canada in a good ten years.
9422762	9429148	Part of me, even though I'm not doing anything at Fanime, I do kind of want to go just to kind of peek.
9429248	9434192	Part of me thinks I might end up there at least one day just kind of looking around because I'm supposed to be in the Bay Area anyway.
9434593	9435093	But we'll see.
9435573	9435834	We'll see.
9435874	9437095	I'm a little iffy right now.
9437856	9441078	Maybe they'll have a game room that doesn't have half the TVs turned off.
9441459	9443661	Fanime always has a really good game room, actually.
9443821	9444441	So we'll see.
9445285	9445585	We'll see.
9446326	9447667	But I have a lot going on next weekend.
9447867	9448227	We'll see.
9448568	9448988	There's a lot.
9450529	9452471	Rob, any other thoughts for our listeners?
9452651	9456794	I'd love to talk about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and how we're actually getting some Tatsu with some
9457382	9458642	I can play as Ryu and Ken.
9458842	9459423	Oh, wait.
9459763	9460323	Wait, not that Ken.
9460543	9463644	But no, I'm excited for that coming to the U.S.
9463684	9466925	or at least very, you know, almost confirmed for the U.S.
9466985	9467465	and everything else.
9467625	9479928	Since you just joined us, did you hear that they have kind of looked at one of the screenshots and you can tell that three characters have already been axed, which we kind of figured was going to, you know, we said when we were kind of talking about this earlier in the show, we were like, well, wait a minute.
9479968	9484549	Maybe they got the licensing, but don't guarantee that they got all of it.
9484609	9486830	And sure enough, three of the characters have been cut, apparently.
9487369	9487929	That's interesting.
9487949	9488610	I didn't know about that.
9488930	9489691	I'll have to look into that.
9489871	9493754	But I guess it's not too surprising considering that's just a nightmare in the U.S.
9493834	9495235	and any other country other than Japan.
9495515	9495976	Exactly.
9496036	9498197	And folks are asking again which characters got axed.
9498237	9499739	Do you remember, Loki, or where you read that?
9499759	9501380	Do you remember who the ones were?
9501400	9503241	I think one of them was Condor Nojo.
9503782	9512929	It was Ibuki, Joe the Condor, and I don't remember the last one.
9513280	9516341	are something real, real, real, I don't remember.
9516902	9517782	Yeah, real, real.
9517822	9518342	Exactly, real.
9518362	9519382	No, not real.
9519723	9520663	Licensing for real.
9520763	9522624	Somebody in chat will yell it out in just a moment.
9522664	9525225	That's what usually happens once they get through the delay.
9525685	9529927	So, uh... Will Kiyot from Battle of the Planets be in there or Ace Goodheart from GeForce?
9529947	9530647	Sorry.
9530667	9531987	I don't think everybody else is still in there.
9532588	9532888	We'll see.
9536796	9538737	Rob, we better let you go so we can get some more calls.
9538977	9540858	Thanks for the call and congratulations again.
9540918	9543320	Good luck with your traveling band of comedy.
9543960	9544460	Thank you very much.
9544540	9545081	I'll see you later.
9545761	9546201	Take care, buddy.
9548402	9549963	We've got time for a couple more calls.
9549983	9553725	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9553745	9556727	We can probably squeeze at least one more call in before the night's up.
9557907	9558548	Go ahead and give us a call.
9558808	9561569	Do we have any last-minute stories real quick before we say goodnight?
9561789	9563050	Yes, I've been collecting them.
9564727	9565467	Hold on, we got a call.
9565487	9566629	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9566649	9566989	Who's this?
9568471	9569312	It's GS-68.
9569632	9570513	Hi, GS-68.
9570533	9571214	What's on your mind, buddy?
9573797	9575098	Don't bother responding to me next year.
9575118	9576880	I think ASAN needs some more of your attention.
9577401	9577962	Wait, what's this?
9579744	9581486	Don't bother responding to me.
9581946	9585170	Nobody from the area listens to all the lore besides me.
9586523	9588545	I know we've skipped out on the past two years.
9588625	9589545	It just hasn't worked out.
9589585	9591747	But dude, ASEN is expensive to go to.
9591847	9593789	I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it again next year.
9593889	9595710	So I definitely want to keep it local, I think.
9598492	9599453	Here's something else.
9600013	9600293	Go ahead.
9600934	9607639	At least there are listeners who go to ASEN, but I don't know anyone who would go to...
9612950	9613730	Thanks for watching!
9634757	9635998	I've been falling out from the DDR scene.
9636038	9637960	I haven't played DDR regularly in a long time.
9654864	9669048	Yeah, so, you know, we'll definitely make it back probably next year, because next year also is, I'm trying to plan, I don't know if it's really going to happen, but I'm having an idea for a Japan tour dangled in front of me, and I kind of want to do it.
9669268	9671549	So it just depends on money and all that good stuff.
9671989	9680511	But if I do that, then no trips to the Midwest next year, or even probably the East Coast, because Japan will... Yeah, I will be...
9681283	9691469	Most likely to make a con report during the con or the week after, and I'll also be leaving updates on Twitter about the con at the front of May.
9691549	9692329	Hopefully.
9692369	9710460	I also want to talk about, like, last week or so, there was a new version of a PC game that Reni plugged on the mailbag several episodes ago, and it has speedrun mode after you beat the games.
9711409	9712130	They got me thinking.
9713271	9714132	Sorry, which game is this?
9715493	9716033	A version.
9716213	9723280	It's a cutesy platformer game where you run around, like, change worlds and collect gems.
9723840	9724941	Oh, yes, okay.
9725822	9729105	Yeah, there's a new version where after you beat the game, there's a time attack mode.
9729485	9732848	And they got me thinking, more games need that kind of stuff.
9732888	9735991	I mean, it kind of, I mean, it gave me the sense to play the game again.
9738689	9739409	And on that topic...
9766048	9770470	It irks me when people say, oh, stop speedrunning the game, or stop playing for score, just have fun.
9770610	9782695	I mean, there are ones now impeding on the fun of people like me who like to play for time or for score, and some people playing for score for time is fun, so...
9784257	9787418	These kind of people seem to let everyone play their own way.
9787598	9788899	It's your fucking quarter.
9788999	9789759	Do what you want.
9789839	9791120	Everyone else can buzz off.
9791200	9795221	As long as you're not breaking the machine or doing things, just do what you want.
9795321	9795981	It's your quarter.
9796501	9807725	Yeah, last week I was in another chat room and I was talking about Guitar Hero scoring the whole multiplier thing and someone was yelling at me saying, No, nobody cares about the scoring of Guitar Hero.
9808025	9809106	It's all about the music.
9809146	9809726	And I'm like...
9810643	9813084	Okay, but what about the people who do play for score?
9813264	9815405	I should maybe revive pop music freestyle.
9831903	9833564	Oh God, poppin' music freestyle.
9833584	9837427	I don't know about that one, especially because there hasn't been a new consumer one in a long time.
9837747	9840850	I know, it was in a movie once, like a couple years ago.
9840930	9842171	They had some guy doing it.
9842191	9843111	Lost in Translation?
9843411	9844752	Yeah, yeah, it was Lost in Translation.
9844792	9849716	But yeah, there hasn't been a lot of movement in that scene in a while.
9849736	9853179	But also keep in mind, there's been no poppin' music consumer style in quite a while.
9855020	9855380	Yeah.
9857402	9859263	We haven't seen, yeah, there's a
9860267	9864150	Poppin' is going through what I call 2DX Consumer Syndrome now.
9865191	9871296	Kind of like how there's a huge delay between 2DX 6 and 6 on PS2 and then another delay between 6 and 7.
9872937	9873798	Oh yeah, I remember that.
9874078	9882945	It could be, it could be, but I, you know, if Konami were smart, they would just nuke all of their franchises and start them over again on PlayStation 3 or next-gen hardware.
9882965	9884987	PlayStation 3 would be good because then you can import that.
9885067	9885547	There you go.
9885567	9886788	It'd be nice.
9886909	9889871	I know, I didn't get started on Poppin' like last October, so it'll be,
9890370	9892951	Nice that we can see 15 and 16 on PS2.
9893011	9897772	Maybe as a single compilation, so that way the series will be caught up.
9898172	9898532	We'll see.
9898572	9902973	I mean, the rumor is the next 2DX on PlayStation 2 is just going to have a crap load of songs.
9903033	9903953	But rumors are rumors.
9903993	9904313	We'll see.
9904713	9906154	Anyway, GSC Steel, we've got to let you go.
9906214	9908534	We need to go and wrap up the show.
9908794	9909694	But thanks so much for your call.
9909714	9910695	And have fun at Faname.
9910735	9912135	And we expect a full report next week.
9913570	9914631	Alright, okay, bye.
9942705	9944636	Anyways, so where was I?
9944877	9945460	Oh, um...
9946832	9954875	So apparently there's a rumor that Battlefield Heroes is going to be headed to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Network, and Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade.
9955275	9961917	As you remember, I believe Battlefield Heroes is the free-to-play game that they have online, kind of a deathmatch-only flair.
9962497	9970319	But apparently it's listed as coming out in June 2009, according to EA's press page.
9971300	9973560	And perhaps this is something they're going to be...
9975521	9977864	Talking about during E3, maybe?
9978845	9979246	Might be neat.
9981949	9993057	Also, for Wii Sports Resort, there's been two more games revealed from a Japanese commercial.
9993557	9998381	Apparently, golf and table tennis will be in Wii Sports Resort.
9998701	10003044	You may remember table tennis was in Wii Play, and golf was in the original Wii Sports.
10003744	10004185	Awesome!
10004245	10006666	They're recycling minigames now.
10007287	10008127	Go Nintendo!
10008307	10008788	Wow.
10010209	10010289	Um...
10012250	10012911	Let's see.
10013372	10014715	But now it's more precise.
10015036	10017821	But yet they don't have... Well, they have table tennis, I guess, but they don't have...
10018749	10020570	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10043584	10048625	The object of the game is to win hands in order to remove articles of clothing from still images of female characters.
10049086	10055387	Nurses, police, women, office workers, and sports figures can eventually be stripped down to show their bare breasts.
10056508	10058048	Ooh, adult games on the Wii.
10058568	10061249	Yeah, I remember strip poker games on the Commodore 64.
10061289	10061969	They were epic.
10062009	10063070	Yeah, but you'd think something like this.
10063090	10064030	Pixelated boobies.
10064450	10071192	They just wouldn't be, you know, coming out on the Wii, because the Wii's a family system, so it's kind of surprising.
10073314	10075516	There's a... This is kind of interesting.
10075536	10086085	Hull Breach Online, the first MMORPG for the Wii's internet channel, has now apparently been scaled down to run on the DSi browser.
10086725	10098174	So yes, it's a free-to-play MMO, and apparently space-themed, and looks very basic, but I can imagine that you can't really do too much with the DSi browser.
10098975	10099536	Kind of limited.
10100977	10101057	Um...
10102639	10105341	And then a little bit more information about Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
10105361	10108923	The game's now being called Tatsunoko vs. Capcom Ultimate All-Stars.
10109864	10113306	And apparently online play may be added in.
10113747	10117990	New characters might happen, and it's supposed to be due out before the end of the year.
10118550	10124394	I was wondering, though, because after some thought, the characters that you were saying were cut were never in the Japanese version to begin with.
10125455	10126996	Yeah, well, I don't know.
10129152	10156978	and then finally it's kind of interesting coming from CodeJunkies.com they have a new accessory that's out now for the Xbox 360 they apparently have figured out how to reverse engineer the memory cards now you can get a device for as cheap as $39.99 and it will use micro SD cards so you can store up to 16 gigabytes of data on there and if you think about that
10157518	10166646	Since it doesn't have all the backwards compatibility stuff like the Xbox 360 hard drives, it's actually larger than the Xbox 360 20 gig hard drives.
10166966	10167186	Nice.
10167226	10170309	Now in memory card form, so you can get these really cheap.
10171149	10176634	And, you know, micro SD cards, those are pretty damn cheap nowadays, especially the 4 gig and, like, 16 gig ones.
10177054	10184520	I think I just got a, well, it wasn't a micro SD, but just a standard HD card for 50 bucks at 16 gigs.
10184540	10184721	So, I mean...
10187981	10188721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10218297	10218637	Maybe.
10218777	10219977	I don't know yet what I've got going on.
10220338	10220658	But maybe.
10220778	10221498	I do want to see it again.
10222778	10223738	Loki, your final thought?
10224639	10228399	This chair hurts my butt, and I'm going to play some Bion Commando this week.
10229020	10229360	Awesome.
10230520	10234921	I don't really have much of a final thought, except I'm excited to be going to L.A.
10234941	10237302	in a couple weeks, and things are good.
10237762	10238262	So that's it.
10239422	10240722	Hopefully I get to play more games this week.
10240762	10241422	That's my final thought.
