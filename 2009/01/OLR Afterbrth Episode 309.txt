All right.
And we're not going to do much of an afterbirth tonight because the show went on so long.
We're having stream problems, and I think I have a cage match pick from Jamie, but I'm not sure.
So we're just going to say screw it and kind of move quickly tonight.
But Victoria did walk back in studio, so I wanted to give her a chance to say any last things she wants to say to the listeners.
It was fun being on the show.
Rob's been trying to get me to come on the show for a while.
It was fun.
I've never really tuned in to listen.
How nerdy is this, seriously?
It is.
You're a nerd factor.
You just got deeper into the nerd forest, my friend.
Do you think we'll have a camera next time?
Yes, we should have a camera next show.
We got sent one from one of our listeners.
Thank you, thank you.
AkumaJP, I believe, was the one that sent it.
And DarkSakura has it, though.
She's going to bring it with her next week.
I'm hoping... I mean, they're going to leave us... Like I said, I'm checking out the game Scratch this week.
And they're leaving us a... It's...
A presentation deck.
It's basically the DJ deck, but I think it's missing all the internals out of it.
Because they wouldn't give me the actual deck.
That would be kind of generous of them.
I don't know if I'm able to bring that in, but I may if I can.
I'd be sweet.
If they don't care.
It was fun.
I did kind of get a headache from all the nerdiness.
I'm sorry.
You suck.
But, you know, I love you.
And this is fun.
You know, I got to hang out with Irene and Matt some more.
So, yeah.
Thanks for letting me be on your show.
Muchas gracias.
De nada.
All that.
We've done this.
You can't believe we've done this almost seven years now.
You have no life, my friend.
The very first night we ever did this.
Do you know how many people listened?
How many?
Twelve.
Nice.
Twelve people.
And honestly, it's not.
We probably have.
about 70 that listen live now.
Hey, it's more than 12.
Yeah, but I mean now thanks to the podcast we have hundreds.
Or two weeks ago we would have done it tonight.
Can I be Brett?
You can be anybody you want, but two weeks ago we did Video Game Match Game and you missed it.
You don't have to really know anything about video games though.
People say random shit.
Oh, fun.
And I know you love Match Game.
I fucking love Match Game.
Rob and I are going to be Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly for Halloween.
Yeah, that's your Halloween costume this year.
Be awesome.
Alright, so there's no cage match tonight.
I'm sorry to say.
We gotta wrap up.
I mean, it's already almost 10 o'clock.
We've been on air four hours.
The podcast is gonna be huge this week.
It's over three hours.
I don't think we've had one clock past three hours in a long time.
But we had a fun time.
Thank you guys very much.
Bye, guys.
I do have a fortune cookie message of the day for you all.
So here it is.
Does it say go fuck yourself?
No.
Here's the fortune cookie message of the day.
That's it.
That's it for my fortune key message of the day.
I love the Syphil and Ollie show.
It's awesome.
So there you have it.
Did you say Romy and Michelle?
You wanted me to do the Romy and Michelle?
Alright, we'll do two fortune cookie messages today just because I love you that much.
Oh, I love this.
I love you that much.
No, I posted this in my live journal and I said... You were watching Romeo and Michelle yesterday.
Yes, I said, I don't know why, but this clip just seems to sum up my life.
So here it is.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, um, great suit.
Is that an Armani?
Yes, yes it is.
I thought so.
So what do you do?
I'm a suit salesman.
Would you excuse me?
I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood.
Be funny.
I know.
You have to actually watch it because of the limp she has as she walks away.
It's kind of crappy.
So everybody.
So that's it.
We're pulling the plug.
We're done.
Bye, guys.
We're out of here.
So we'll see you next week.
Same bat time, same bat channel.
Jamie will be back.
We'll talk more.
Another friend of mine wants to come on the show.
So we'll see.
Matt.
We'll see.
The one that was here for New Year's.
He wants to come talk about PC games.
We'll have that.
It'll be fun.
It'll be cool.
That's it.
We're done.
We're out of here.
We'll see you next week.
Bye.
Thank you for watching!
