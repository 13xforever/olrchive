00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:23,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, January 25th, 2009, GameTap removes some of its free games, Dawn of War 2 disappears from GameStop, and did Uebo finally win a movie award?

2
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:36,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:42,652
[SPEAKER_07]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:52,899
[SPEAKER_07]: We do tape live on Sunday nights every week at allgames.com and it's all brought to you by myself, Rob Roberts, and my wonderful co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

5
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:54,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Worship me!

6
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Back after a week of absence.

7
00:00:58,162 --> 00:00:59,663
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you doing in your week of absence?

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Writing the charter for my cult.

9
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:02,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

10
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:08,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this is a conversation carried over from Bobby's show, which can be heard before us Sunday nights live.

11
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:09,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Official drink is Propel.

12
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:13,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura apparently is going to be fixing the economy by starting a cult.

13
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:15,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And somehow this is going to fix the economy.

14
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,004
[SPEAKER_02]: My plan is brilliant.

15
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the companies aren't making enough money because the consumers aren't buying because they don't have money because they've been losing equity in their home and going into foreclosure and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

16
00:01:27,026 --> 00:01:28,246
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll tell you what.

17
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:30,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me all your money.

18
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:36,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go and pump money back into the economy on my wild spending spree.

19
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:43,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Help the banks by getting the biggest mortgage ever, which I will be paying off with your money, of course.

20
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:48,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, personally revitalizing our bank and credit system.

21
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,448
[SPEAKER_07]: And what about everybody else who's broke because they gave you money?

22
00:01:50,468 --> 00:01:51,128
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they going to do?

23
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:54,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when the economy's better, hi, they'll get new money.

24
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And jobs!

25
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:00,446
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be jobs to accommodate my shopping spree.

26
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,009
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, whenever I think about cults... And there's more.

27
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,374
[SPEAKER_02]: With the stuff I decide not to keep any longer after my wild shopping spree, I put it back on eBay.

28
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:17,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these people who now have jobs to accommodate my needs can buy the stuff off of eBay.

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brilliant.

30
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And I replenish my money.

31
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:21,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

32
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:22,315
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

33
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:41,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto 4 The Work

34
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:10,393
[SPEAKER_08]: on my PC.

35
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:16,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, what it comes down to now is I'm going to have to actually reinstall Windows for it to work.

36
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:19,677
[SPEAKER_08]: That's quality developing right there.

37
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:21,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Quality.

38
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,900
[SPEAKER_08]: When a game requires you to reinstall your operating system for it to work correctly.

39
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

40
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:28,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Kudos, Rockstar.

41
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:31,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you thought about calling customer support or anything?

42
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:36,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I post on GTA forums and they have Rockstar Toronto is actually their

43
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Are other people having the problems you're having, or is it just you?

44
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:47,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, some people are having the same problems I'm having, no one's helping them either, and people are also having other problems.

45
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,140
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a new patch that came out that caused even more problems, so awesome!

46
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,360
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you talking about?

47
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,721
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no problems!

48
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:54,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweep under the rug, sweep under the rug.

49
00:03:54,902 --> 00:04:03,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's only, it's less than 1% of, yeah, see they pulled the old Microsoft bit where it's all, it's less than 1% of our customers are having problems with Grand Theft Auto 4.

50
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:05,949
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just they happen to be the most vocal of the bunch here.

51
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,692
[SPEAKER_08]: How does it feel to be less than 1%, Loki?

52
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:10,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm special.

53
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:12,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I have three words for you.

54
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:14,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Better business bureau.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I have more words for you.

56
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:20,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pirating their next game and I'm not buying their shit anymore.

57
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,891
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that going to hurt them?

58
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:25,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

59
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,463
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

60
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:10,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

61
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's nothing I can do.

62
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:31,965
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty you can do.

63
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I can call their customer service and they go, oh, I don't know what's wrong.

64
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:39,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can, you know, send a letter into the CEO.

65
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,791
[SPEAKER_02]: You can write the Better Business Bureau and file a complaint.

66
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:45,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Or he can get on his podcast and tell hundreds of people.

67
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:49,414
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, okay, I'm overestimating our listener base a little bit.

68
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:50,614
[SPEAKER_07]: He can tell dozens of people.

69
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:52,195
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a problem I have.

70
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to say it for the FUs.

71
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:58,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, though, I mean, I've been more than...

72
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been more than generous to them, I should say.

73
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:14,619
[SPEAKER_08]: At our work, we have a LAN set up and everything, and I've purchased copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 on 360 for each one of those systems.

74
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:17,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's five different systems that have that game.

75
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:20,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I think overall, I purchased about six copies of that game.

76
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:22,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say that's more than generous.

77
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that I was even...

78
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:25,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

79
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:52,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, and sadly enough, I'll probably be buying the download content that'll be coming out for Grand Theft Auto 4.

80
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:56,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And I may even buy the download content for each one of those systems.

81
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,451
[SPEAKER_08]: That's $100 right there.

82
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:58,551
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

83
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

84
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:07,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I think unless they come out... Because basically what it is now is, oh, well, something in your system is causing it not to work.

85
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:08,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

86
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:12,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for narrowing it down to something in my computer causing it not to work.

87
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I was worried that it might have been the birds outside.

88
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,545
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to see me on the phone with customers.

89
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,274
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's annoying.

90
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:49,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I even went and uninstalled and reinstalled Service Pack 3 just to see if maybe that would fix it, but of course not.

91
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and it doesn't help either that it takes 40 minutes to install Grand Theft Auto.

92
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:56,224
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

93
00:07:56,284 --> 00:08:00,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com is making a request.

94
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, we always like to have the chat room involved during our show tonight.

95
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:08,407
[SPEAKER_07]: A request that if Loki does decide to call customer service, please, please record it and play it on a future episode.

96
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:09,627
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's my thing.

97
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:09,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my thing.

98
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to go too far into this.

99
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:17,509
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, is calling customer service – I mean, a lot of those reps, no disrespect, they do a very thankless job.

100
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:18,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I did customer service.

101
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

102
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And I teach for it.

103
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,531
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, they're kind of given a script.

104
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:23,311
[SPEAKER_07]: They're given limits.

105
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,192
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't change a lot at their level.

106
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:30,653
[SPEAKER_07]: If he really wants something to happen, he's going to have to get attention of people upstairs.

107
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:31,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going through the right routes.

108
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:37,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going through GTA forums, and they have the developers on there actually reading people's comments.

109
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're supposedly looking into things.

110
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,436
[SPEAKER_08]: They're supposed to also be...

111
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:43,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

112
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:56,847
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

113
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:15,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Period.

114
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:20,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Just stops working, and no matter how many times I uninstall it, reinstall it, do whatever, it does not work.

115
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:21,709
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't make any sense.

116
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,870
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura's dying to make a comment, and then we gotta move on to Gaming Weeks.

117
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,371
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually about customer service.

118
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

119
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, have you done customer service yourself?

120
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:30,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, yeah.

121
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:32,134
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the industry I work in.

122
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:34,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But have you answered the calls?

123
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:35,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

124
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:36,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, of course.

125
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to, to be able to teach him.

126
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:52,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not necessarily my work, but I did customer service, and I can actually say that script is only good for the first month of the job, and after that, a good rep is going to know their shit, know who to go to, and know how to solve your problem.

127
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get me wrong, especially at the place I work, we've got great reps.

128
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:02,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I just say that a lot of times, unfortunately, their hands are a little tied in what they can and can't do.

129
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,310
[SPEAKER_07]: There's certain processes, procedures, rules in place.

130
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,731
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only so much they can do.

131
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:09,553
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll do whatever it takes for the people on the line.

132
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:13,677
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I don't work in the video game industry either, and neither do you.

133
00:10:13,717 --> 00:10:19,802
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think our industries give us a lot more leeway in those types of freedoms than a video game company.

134
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:20,542
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

135
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:21,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

136
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:29,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little easier for you to investigate alone or my people to get claims paid that need to be or whatever than to fix a game.

137
00:10:29,787 --> 00:10:30,368
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

138
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:32,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that makes sense.

139
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

140
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think in their world it's a lot more limiting.

141
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:43,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, if you work in that world and care to disagree with us, you can always send us an email.

142
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:44,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would actually like to know how video game customer support goes.

144
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:52,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd actually like to hear more about that too.

145
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:56,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think that there's way too many parallels from one to the other.

146
00:10:57,225 --> 00:11:05,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've talked to people who've done tech support that there's ways to get the help and ways to get the official answer.

147
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:06,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

148
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:08,183
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on.

149
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:09,644
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to talk about our gaming weeks.

150
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:13,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And usually we start off each of us talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week.

151
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:15,667
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to deviate a little bit tonight.

152
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:23,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to let Loki start tonight because he checked out a game that I think a lot of our longtime listeners are going to be interested in because it's a music-based game.

153
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,734
[SPEAKER_07]: He kind of got a sneak preview at this.

154
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:31,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not heard a lot about this game outside of this show, but I don't know.

155
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, does it look to be something I should be keeping an eye on?

156
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, definitely.

157
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a brand new game.

158
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:43,065
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people may be familiar with DJ Hero, which is supposed to be coming out from Activision later this year.

159
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,727
[SPEAKER_08]: There was another music game that's also turntable-based that's going to be...

160
00:11:49,346 --> 00:11:50,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Scratch, The Ultimate DJ

161
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:25,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what this game is, what makes it kind of unique, is the game relies a lot on actual turntable techniques.

162
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:28,368
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

163
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:49,677
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

164
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:07,347
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

165
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:36,525
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually a turntable that looks like a Numark turntable.

166
00:13:37,145 --> 00:13:49,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you've got five keys next to it, kind of like a Beatmania arcade-style controller, except they're all in a line, kind of like the Guitar Hero fret buttons, but a lot bigger and kind of nicer looking.

167
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:52,493
[SPEAKER_08]: and next to that is actually a crossfader.

168
00:13:53,053 --> 00:14:07,562
[SPEAKER_08]: So during those sections that you can scratch in, you can actually do real turntable techniques with it and the game will pick up on that and award you points and award you saying, okay, you did this, this, and this.

169
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:09,003
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

170
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, right now it's set to come out in June.

171
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:30,962
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be about $100 retail.

172
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And PlayStation 3 and 360.

173
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:35,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks pretty awesome.

174
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:38,246
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty much everything you would expect from Beatmania.

175
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,787
[SPEAKER_08]: The controllers, ambidextrous.

176
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:44,288
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have like 60 songs.

177
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:49,010
[SPEAKER_08]: It's licensed hip-hop and R&B, which may not be for everybody.

178
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:55,232
[SPEAKER_08]: That kind of turned me off of it at first until I actually saw it being played, and it's pretty cool.

179
00:14:56,212 --> 00:15:07,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the tracks that I think they have confirmed for it so far, like Flashing Lights by Kanye West, Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Peter Piper by Run DMC.

180
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:08,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo-hoo!

181
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:25,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Hot in Here by Nelly, Milkshake by Killis, Friends by Houdini, Party Like a Rockstar by Shopboys, and Don't Sweat the Technique by Aaron B and Ray Kim.

182
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:36,107
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, you're talking about a game, it looks like Beatmania, and a question coming from our chat is, GS68 is making the Konami will sue joke.

183
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:40,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's going to be something that's too close to comfort for Konami?

184
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:49,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Their controller is different enough, I don't know if they can sue them because of the controller, since it's not just, the way it functions is a little bit different.

185
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the interface itself is different than Beatmania.

186
00:15:54,716 --> 00:16:09,779
[SPEAKER_08]: The way the screen looks, it's almost like a candy cane, I guess, because kind of towards the left side of the screen, you'll see like a turntable spinning, and the notes come off the turntable, and they kind of turn around, and then they come down like Beatmania would.

187
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,659
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, it's similar in the way it's played, but I don't know.

188
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm sure they'll try to sue them anyways, but...

189
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the way you described it, though, makes me think that Beatmania and Kraken DJ spawned.

190
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:27,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, with the whole crossfader and everything, it does kind of sound like it's a mix of them.

191
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:30,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And the scratching, it's like a love baby of the two.

192
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,007
[SPEAKER_07]: But no techno.

193
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:41,831
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of people in our chat who are in that Beatmania mindset, thinking like, oh, if this game's going to have a Beatmania-style controller, I see Acidic Vampire says, I want techno.

194
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:42,351
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing.

195
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:44,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Techno does not have scratching in it, usually.

196
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,352
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they basically stuck to hip-hop.

197
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:49,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Could do, though, good drum and bass.

198
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,955
[SPEAKER_08]: They could, and I don't see why they can't.

199
00:16:54,095 --> 00:17:03,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just that they're really focusing on music that's going to be scratchable, that you would hear scratching in.

200
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:12,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Another cool thing about it is they're going to have a microphone port on it that you'll actually be able to sample yourself or whatever and mix it into the actual songs.

201
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:15,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wiggity, wiggity, whack.

202
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:18,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see myself yelling that in the microphone over and over.

203
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:29,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And some other cool stuff they were saying, that they're going to have some sort of way to play back your performances or something, which is kind of cool.

204
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,296
[SPEAKER_07]: HIP HOP MANIA

205
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:01,677
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

206
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it looks good.

207
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:23,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say definitely give it a shot.

208
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:26,833
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a lot more stuff coming out about it as it gets closer.

209
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,774
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be really marketing this pretty heavily.

210
00:18:29,214 --> 00:18:31,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's going to be a really awesome game.

211
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:35,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when you consider... Now, because I kept asking about DJ Hero and stuff like that.

212
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:44,583
[SPEAKER_08]: The difference between them and DJ Hero is DJ Hero is going to be more... Basically, the aim of the game is to mix two songs together.

213
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas this is actually about scratching.

214
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:48,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

215
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:49,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

216
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:51,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks pretty cool, though, so far.

217
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask the chat room about this, though.

218
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask a question to chat, and we'll read some of your responses in a minute.

219
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:02,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Gil, because I know we have a lot of people that have been listening to us for a long time, so we have a lot of music game fans in chat.

220
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:10,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this game interest you, even though the music may not be the type of music you're used to in these types of games?

221
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:14,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't think we've had a real... I should say one that can be taken very seriously.

222
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:15,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we've had the, what...

223
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Move It To The Streets or whatever that game was called.

224
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:20,448
[SPEAKER_07]: The Dance Battle or whatever.

225
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:22,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had that one random Xbox Live Arcade game.

226
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:30,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about, you know, this sounds like it's going to be pretty... Chatroom, are you interested in this game even though it's going to be hip-hop and not techno?

227
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Chatroom.

228
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:34,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And I asked the same question to Jamie.

229
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:35,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this of interest to you?

230
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:38,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

231
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:39,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably won't play it.

232
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll probably check it out.

233
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:44,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually really didn't like Kraken DJ.

234
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:45,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

235
00:19:47,392 --> 00:19:50,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have no interest in any of that music.

236
00:19:51,373 --> 00:20:01,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the exception of the two pretty classic ones mentioned, Run DMC and Rakim.

237
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:05,216
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really have no interest in that music at all.

238
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:11,198
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have no interest in the hip-hop lifestyle, really.

239
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care for it.

240
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have an interest in the game.

241
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:27,639
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my big sticking point, too, is that, you know, it's like, you know, I have an appreciation for some of that, you know, like you say, like the classics and some of those and even the silly dance songs like Milkshake and stuff I get a kick out of.

242
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I don't know.

243
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,760
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of worry.

244
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,262
[SPEAKER_07]: $100 is a lot to ask, but I'll probably give it the benefit of the doubt.

245
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm definitely interested in checking it out.

246
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:44,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to check it out because, you know, if the interface works well and it's put together well, that's when I think we need to lobby these people to do the techno one we want.

247
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:45,247
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

248
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:48,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, and they're going to have... Not all of the music's going to be licensed.

249
00:20:48,968 --> 00:20:50,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some of it they're actually making.

250
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:56,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very well, I don't see why they couldn't do, like, house music or something like that that would have, you know, scratching in it.

251
00:20:57,072 --> 00:20:57,692
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just...

252
00:20:59,033 --> 00:21:08,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there can be some techno songs they could have scratching it, but you would normally not hear a techno artist, if you went to a club, scratching out stuff with it.

253
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:09,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It just wouldn't make any sense.

254
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And song lists are so critically important in music games, too.

255
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:19,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Why didn't any of us buy Karaoke Revolution Country Edition?

256
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:21,997
[SPEAKER_07]: The name of the game one more time, Loki?

257
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:49,663
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let me read some comments from chat, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks with DarkSakura in just a moment.

258
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I asked the chat room, are you interested in this game?

259
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:57,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this game sound interesting to you, even though it's not the typical type of music you've seen in other music games that have come out here?

260
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,526
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR says, yes, it does.

261
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,647
[SPEAKER_07]: ActDeft says it does, but what's turning me off is the price.

262
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:04,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

263
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:11,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Bocci Kawa says, personally, I play beat-bit games for the music, but I have a broad interest when it comes to music.

264
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:11,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll play it.

265
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,874
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR says, I would like spinning to music that we could actually hear in a club.

266
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Class says, probably not, because I don't listen to hip-hop.

267
00:22:21,057 --> 00:22:25,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Biohaze says, I would only be interested if you could load music from your hard drive and play it from that.

268
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, not interested.

269
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:28,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Frisbee says, simply, no, not interested.

270
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:32,665
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya said, yeah, if they had an in-store demo or something, I'd at least try it once.

271
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:33,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

272
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Leo Shen says, not really.

273
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:37,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Songs kill it for me, to be honest.

274
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:39,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Acidic Vampire says, I agree with Dark Tetsuya.

275
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:44,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to try it out first before I can judge it, but I'm not really into hip hop, but it could be fun.

276
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:48,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Misty says, I'd probably get it eventually when I can eBay it for like half price.

277
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Milkshake is an in-joke bonus for me.

278
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:51,673
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

279
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Two words would actually, two words would swing it a little bit for me.

280
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:56,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Beastie Boys.

281
00:22:57,856 --> 00:22:58,776
[SPEAKER_07]: How about 9-1-1 is a joke?

282
00:23:00,356 --> 00:23:02,157
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some old school public enemy.

283
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:06,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, there's going to be like 40 some songs and that's only like six of them.

284
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:08,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like I said, it's five months away.

285
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't even know anything about like DJ Hero.

286
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that game could be completely lame.

287
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:22,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be much different other than exchanging out a turntable for the guitar controller.

288
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,830
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very interested to see what develops.

289
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,251
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely have an eye on this game.

290
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:31,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about games we've had our eyes on this week, or in DarkSakura's case, the past two weeks.

291
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:32,576
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week?

292
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:36,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was pretty bare because I started school this week.

293
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much just played some Fable and a little Ragnarok and that was it.

294
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:45,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really have not had a whole lot of time to play much of anything else.

295
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,108
[SPEAKER_07]: School does that, doesn't it?

296
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:53,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I played some Katamari on my phone, but I kept getting interrupted, so I haven't gotten past the first stage.

297
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And lots of solitaire.

298
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:56,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

299
00:23:58,512 --> 00:23:58,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

300
00:23:59,173 --> 00:23:59,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And I finished a book.

301
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:00,993
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

302
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:02,534
[SPEAKER_02]: V, The Second Generation.

303
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:03,274
[SPEAKER_07]: How was that?

304
00:24:03,454 --> 00:24:04,934
[SPEAKER_02]: That was freaking amazing.

305
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:07,235
[SPEAKER_07]: You've talked a lot about V. Book review.

306
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:07,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, quick.

307
00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:09,256
[SPEAKER_07]: For those that don't know what V is...

308
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:19,377
[SPEAKER_02]: V, it was a series that came on in the early 80s about these visitors from outer space who came trying to be, you know, on the surface they were friendly.

309
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned out they're trying to steal all of our water and eat everybody.

310
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were really lizard people underneath.

311
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually rent the DVDs.

312
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:34,405
[SPEAKER_02]: But the creator of the first series did not like how they continued the series when they did the TV series in V, The Final Battle.

313
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:37,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So he actually wrote a book about

314
00:24:37,987 --> 00:25:01,706
[SPEAKER_02]: about what the world would be like 20 years after what he envisioned going on happened and it's it's like watching it reads like watching the episodes it's very very visual and you know in far as how it's been in the description and it's just a fantastic book so if anyone's a fan of V get the book just get it get it get it and yes Robert England was in V he was in there as Willie and that character is in the book

315
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,759
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a question from our chatroom, AsceticVampire.

316
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:05,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

317
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knew that you were going to get a book review?

318
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:11,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fucking literal, okay?

319
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:12,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I love reading.

320
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:14,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Books are fun.

321
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

322
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:17,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Books are fundamental.

323
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:19,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Books are fun to burn.

324
00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:20,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

325
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:24,129
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your gaming week, Loki, outside of scratch?

326
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very well.

327
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,691
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a grant the thought of forth.

328
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:27,631
[SPEAKER_08]: That's basically it.

329
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:28,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Just played it at work.

330
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:30,593
[SPEAKER_08]: But not on your PC.

331
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:58,377
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah most definitely not on my PC yeah that's basically it unfortunately I wanted to play some other things I keep trying to go back to Fable 2 and I really need to finish and there's no way I'm going to finish it in time Lost Odyssey because god damn it if Star Ocean is not coming out in like a month from now I'm not going to ever finish Lost Odyssey

332
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:01,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know you were a big Star Ocean fan.

333
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:03,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a big Star Ocean fan, but it looks awesome.

334
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:06,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not played any of the Star Ocean games.

335
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,196
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was okay.

336
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:10,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't finish it.

337
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:13,458
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm the only one that actually played quite a few games this week.

338
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:18,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, I shouldn't say that because I pretty much spent all of my gaming time on one game.

339
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:26,463
[SPEAKER_07]: But I actually spent a lot of time, like for me, a large amount of time on Fable 2, which is kind of one of those games I meant to check out last year.

340
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,204
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, the holidays are so busy.

341
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:31,425
[SPEAKER_07]: There were some games I said, look, I'm not going to get to these games until January, February.

342
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki was good enough to loan me a copy of Fable 2.

343
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:35,587
[SPEAKER_07]: A legit copy.

344
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:36,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

345
00:26:36,268 --> 00:26:38,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Based on what we talked about earlier in the show, this was a legit copy.

346
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:41,454
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of fun.

347
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having way more fun with this one than I did the first game.

348
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:44,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you being evil?

349
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:45,533
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

350
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:22,913
[SPEAKER_07]: and how Nintendo is going to be putting this, you know, they patented, I should say, not necessarily putting this in, but patenting this mode where you're going to be able to just, at a touch of a button, get little videos that help you with the game and even just skip right over certain parts of the game or watch them played for you.

351
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:25,055
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like basically turning games into movies or whatever.

352
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:28,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki was very vehemently, like, against this, saying, like, I'm not going to buy the game.

353
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:30,359
[SPEAKER_07]: But what struck me as funny

354
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Fable 2 is almost one step away from that.

355
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:39,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that little gold path really makes it easy to know where to go.

356
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,212
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have the option of turning it off.

357
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:42,053
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

358
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: You can turn it off.

359
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also turn this other thing off we were talking about last week.

360
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:50,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Until I learned the world well enough, I actually kind of needed it.

361
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I still definitely need it, but I veer from the path all the time because I'm always afraid I'm going to miss treasures.

362
00:27:56,092 --> 00:28:06,136
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fantastic thing about this game is it reminds me a lot of Oblivion, which is a game I really loved because there was just like an open world, do whatever you want, go wherever type of thing.

363
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:14,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it has that multiplayer aspect to it, and it's kind of in a much different art style, a much different presentation.

364
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the most important question about this, Rob.

365
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:18,276
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you name your dog?

366
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:19,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Wienerschnitzel.

367
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I named mine Dumbass.

368
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:22,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you?

369
00:28:22,764 --> 00:28:24,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the dog is stupid.

370
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:26,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Bark, bark, bark!

371
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:27,091
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

372
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:28,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I already got that treasure box, stupid!

373
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:38,832
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know, I'm having a lot of fun with the game, just kind of running around and doing stuff and dancing for villagers and trying to get people to marry me, although it hasn't been successful so far.

374
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:40,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm just not dancing enough, or what?

375
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,954
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that you need to do, Rob.

376
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:47,176
[SPEAKER_02]: An achievement that you need to unlock, and this is one that Tiara told me about.

377
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:47,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

378
00:28:48,236 --> 00:28:57,440
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get the pelvic thrust emote, then you need to go to the sheriff in the marketplace, strip naked...

379
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Target him and do the pelvic thrust What happens?

380
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you get thrown in jail for loot?

381
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,399
[SPEAKER_02]: You find a thousand gold and you get an achievement for it

382
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:08,466
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

383
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:31,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the game's very adult.

384
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:33,289
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the polygamist.

385
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:37,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I searched the drawers in one house, the cabinet or whatever, and I found a condom.

386
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:41,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, wow, this game's kind of adult nature.

387
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:44,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I dug a hole in the ground and found condoms, okay?

388
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so stupid.

389
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:46,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't want this.

390
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:46,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

391
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would bury condoms in the ground?

392
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:48,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Goddammit.

393
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:49,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Dumbass the dog.

394
00:29:51,336 --> 00:29:53,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, dumbass the condom-sniffing dog.

395
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:53,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

396
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:54,797
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

397
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:56,918
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do a Fable webcomic.

398
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:04,312
[SPEAKER_02]: The Adventures of Little Sparrow and Dumbass the Dog.

399
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:08,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I'm going by Master Chief because I have the special edition.

400
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,557
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I've just been having fun just kind of messing around.

401
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:15,219
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing I noticed about Fable 2, your character never has to sleep.

402
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:16,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, ever.

403
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:19,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

404
00:30:39,934 --> 00:30:43,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now my character needs to seriously buy a lot of celery.

405
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:44,615
[SPEAKER_02]: For what?

406
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:46,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she's been eating meat pie.

407
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:49,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's a little chubby.

408
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:57,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft in chat says, VGCats beat you to that webcomic idea and link to VGCats recent edition.

409
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:58,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to look at that a little later.

410
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:08,566
[SPEAKER_07]: The rest of my gaming week, I have some news that might come as a bit of a shock to some of our regular listeners.

411
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a conscious decision this morning to cancel my World of Warcraft account.

412
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you applauding that?

413
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:17,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be mean.

414
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:19,223
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how long it lasts.

415
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:20,664
[SPEAKER_07]: She's skeptic.

416
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:23,586
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but just, yeah.

417
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:25,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I canceled it.

418
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:26,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to say much more.

419
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:28,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing anybody did in-game.

420
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,731
[SPEAKER_07]: No drama, nothing like that.

421
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:33,673
[SPEAKER_07]: But just kind of the thing that it really was starting to feel like.

422
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Even I was starting to go, I'm playing this game too much.

423
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:38,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So I pulled the plug.

424
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:39,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can do that.

425
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I have enough self-control where I can do that.

426
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:43,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I might not have much.

427
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:48,474
[SPEAKER_07]: but I had enough where I was finally just able to recognize, you know what, I'm starting to treat this like a second job.

428
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:49,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to step away.

429
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:53,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to level up in real life for a little while.

430
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:55,836
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my big shocking news.

431
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we'll see how long it lasts.

432
00:31:57,836 --> 00:31:58,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

433
00:31:58,537 --> 00:31:59,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Be skeptical.

434
00:31:59,237 --> 00:31:59,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

435
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:00,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I deserve it.

436
00:32:00,937 --> 00:32:03,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially after quitting and going back to Final Fantasy XI.

437
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:07,079
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do want to make it clear, I did not quit World of Warcraft to go back to Final Fantasy XI.

438
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:15,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I can safely say I have had lulls, but I'm still playing Ragnarok online after eight years.

439
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:16,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine years, sorry.

440
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:17,363
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

441
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:23,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that I'm finally done with WoW for the foreseeable future, I should actually go check out Ragnarok for a little bit.

442
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,089
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also, here's the problem.

443
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to ditch one MMO and then just go play another MMO.

444
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:32,195
[SPEAKER_02]: The good thing about Ragnarok, though, is it really, especially if you play on a private server, it's just like, oh, whatever.

445
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:33,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

446
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll do this.

447
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:34,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm done.

448
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, oh, grind!

449
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:37,902
Ah!

450
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:45,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually, Rob, I'll tell you what, I'm actually going to be joining another private server for a different game.

451
00:32:45,893 --> 00:32:48,935
[SPEAKER_02]: We are starting VOL Army on Phantasy Star Online.

452
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:49,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

453
00:32:49,936 --> 00:32:50,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Another blue burst server.

454
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:52,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Are those still around?

455
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:57,521
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, and they have all the Japanese quest updates, and people are translating them.

456
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:58,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird.

457
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:00,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it official, or is it all under the table bootleg stuff?

458
00:33:00,383 --> 00:33:01,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all under the table, but Sega don't care.

459
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:05,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega was actually letting you transfer some of your characters over.

460
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:10,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I really liked Phantasy Star Online, and you don't get that immersed in that, you know what I mean?

461
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:14,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's something that you can sit and play through a little bit.

462
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:17,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play it all day if you want to, you can play it a little bit if you want to.

463
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:21,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also kick rappies, which is fantastic.

464
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:21,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate rappies.

465
00:33:22,695 --> 00:33:23,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you should do that.

466
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:27,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, SSJ100Matt suggesting I go back to DDR.

467
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:31,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I would love to play DDR, but they don't really have a machine around here.

468
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We should play.

469
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:01,529
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

470
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,263
[SPEAKER_07]: A new little game.

471
00:34:12,303 --> 00:34:15,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

472
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:17,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like a DDR clone thing.

473
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:20,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's like an expansion you actually load into Step Mania or something like that.

474
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:25,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix, the demo or what have you, was released.

475
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:27,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can load it into Step Mania.

476
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:31,675
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all these in-jokes from Orange Lounge Radio, but now in DDR.

477
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:34,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they have Still Alive as one of the songs.

478
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:38,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, I don't know, some recording of me singing a DDR song from like

479
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:38,819
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

480
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:38,979
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

481
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:01,809
[SPEAKER_09]: My people.

482
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:02,189
[SPEAKER_07]: My people.

483
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:02,589
[SPEAKER_07]: My people.

484
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:30,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

485
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go ahead and get into gaming news.

486
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:35,428
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't talked anything about gaming news yet.

487
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's please get into that.

488
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:37,570
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

489
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:40,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, we touched scratch.

490
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:43,034
[SPEAKER_07]: That was more of like a gaming exclusive.

491
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get into the news that you read everywhere else on the internet now.

492
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:57,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we are big fans of Katamari and Takahashi's brand new game, Nobi Nobi Boy, which I still don't know what exactly you have to do in this.

493
00:35:57,602 --> 00:36:00,204
[SPEAKER_07]: But ironically, Katamari is not fans of us.

494
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:01,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

495
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:03,947
[SPEAKER_08]: How I forget.

496
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:05,428
[SPEAKER_07]: How 2006 of me, I know.

497
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:06,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

498
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:12,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, Nobi Nobi Boy will be available on the PlayStation Network February 19th.

499
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:14,235
[SPEAKER_08]: It is coming out at a whopping $5.

500
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:14,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

501
00:36:16,055 --> 00:36:17,175
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

502
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,661
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

503
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:11,989
[SPEAKER_08]: All the combined, basically everybody in the world that's playing this game contributes to her getting longer and after she gets so long, it unlocks a new level for you.

504
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody is kind of working to unlock new levels.

505
00:37:15,812 --> 00:37:16,833
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a cute idea.

506
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,434
[SPEAKER_07]: The world, the clouds look like tasty fluffy donuts.

507
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:19,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't talk about food, you're gonna make me hungry.

508
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they talking about releasing a demo or anything so I can at least try this game out?

509
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Or am I just going to have to basically throw $5 into the wind and hope that just because it has the Katamari guy's name on it, it's cool?

510
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:58,422
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no mention of a demo at all, but most of the PSN games do get demos.

511
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:00,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Some do not, but most of them do.

512
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:03,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever happened to him making childhood playground equipment?

513
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:04,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he has.

514
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:05,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

515
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:16,755
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, I don't want to know what his playground equipment looks like since he always comes up with these crazy things that eat things and roll over things and absorb them.

516
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:17,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably kind of scary.

517
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:21,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Takahashi's Borg playground equipment.

518
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:22,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Become one.

519
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:24,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Assimilate into the playground equipment.

520
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:29,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also on PlayStation Network, LittleBigPlanet has not released anything in a little while.

521
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:34,476
[SPEAKER_07]: They had that big Metal Gear Solid thing right before Christmas, and they were kind of on holiday break.

522
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:40,682
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are coming back, apparently, on January 26th, I believe, which is tomorrow?

523
00:38:41,994 --> 00:38:43,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that might be over in the UK, I don't know.

524
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,084
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically as of this next week, you're going to start to see some new costumes show up on the PlayStation Network.

525
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:51,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts with the Chinese New Year costumes.

526
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:52,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I see.

527
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: They come out on January 26th.

528
00:38:54,872 --> 00:38:56,415
[SPEAKER_07]: The rest of the costumes go with the regular updates.

529
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,896
[SPEAKER_07]: The cool thing is the Chinese New Year costumes are going to be free.

530
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:09,379
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't said exactly how much the other packs are going to cost, including a Groundhog Day costume, a Valentine's Day mini pack, an Ape Escape costume, and a Toro costume.

531
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:10,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Both of which are from Japan.

532
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:12,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And a Wipeout costume kit.

533
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is kind of interesting.

534
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:22,606
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I also thought was, and caught my eye, was on January 29th, with the Groundhog Day costume, a God of War mini-pack is coming out with a Kratos costume.

535
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,889
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if that means a God of War level thing, which it sounds like it might be.

536
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:31,552
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the download content that was available if you pre-ordered the game at GameStop.

537
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:32,573
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other thing I'm wondering.

538
00:39:32,593 --> 00:39:35,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it just the... I got one of those.

539
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I didn't pre-order the game, they gave me the slip anyway.

540
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:39,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It was only a costume.

541
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:40,518
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't a lot of other stuff.

542
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:43,040
[SPEAKER_08]: There were stickers also that were with it, I think.

543
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there were, I just don't remember.

544
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:50,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember the big controversy was someone made a God of War level with those stickers and it got banned from there?

545
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:55,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Well then if that's coming out, where's the Heavenly Sword and all the other stuff that was supposed to come out too?

546
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:56,713
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my other question.

547
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:58,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, later.

548
00:40:00,176 --> 00:40:00,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

549
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:04,380
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess this would be a sign for those that got frustrated because they didn't get the pre-order bundle.

550
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:07,884
[SPEAKER_07]: They will be able to get the content, although you can bet you it's going to cost money.

551
00:40:08,857 --> 00:40:10,880
[SPEAKER_07]: You can betcha it'll cost money.

552
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially in this economy.

553
00:40:12,362 --> 00:40:13,764
[SPEAKER_07]: They gotta make money wherever they can, right?

554
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:14,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

555
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:17,129
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, money is...

556
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:18,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

557
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:25,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say running short and the recession is hitting.

558
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really on a worldwide basis.

559
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:41,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Eidos closed their Manchester studio so that they can do just the big name games instead of developing smaller ones.

560
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:47,774
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to put as high quality titles that will deliver long term franchise value.

561
00:40:48,334 --> 00:41:06,933
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever um so basically it's just 14 people and all they did was make mobile games um but still for those 14 people you know and there's been a lot of you know just cutback news across the industries every week we're reporting on something and you know uh

562
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:33,881
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when we were doing the call earlier with Bobby Blackwolf from the show before us you know he's been joking about how his show is just one it's been one downer after another not you know because it's bad content but just the news has just been layoff layoff layoff and then even you know what I don't know if you guys know this I think we talked about a little on the show last week but there was the Gamerscore blog at Xbox site that you know they did a lot for the community and in fact they were a big reason why

563
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:34,642
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just... eugh.

564
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:56,605
[SPEAKER_07]: It's especially kind of, ooh, kind of hits you right in the gut when some of these people were famous for the podcasts and vidcasts that they had developed that caught Microsoft's eye and hired them on.

565
00:41:56,645 --> 00:41:59,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of them had relocated themselves out there.

566
00:41:59,687 --> 00:42:03,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, the world works in mysterious ways.

567
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,221
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

568
00:42:23,255 --> 00:42:36,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, you know, are getting laid off and stuff, hopefully when things settle down and the economy starts to come back, because what goes down must go back up eventually, people are going to find something they really, really like and hopefully it won't be such a bad thing.

569
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my little philosophical moment for the day.

570
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:45,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to be Miss Sunshine, but you know, I'm just a ray of freaking sunshine today, aren't I?

571
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:46,684
[SPEAKER_02]: You're pooping rainbows.

572
00:42:48,672 --> 00:42:50,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Somehow I don't think I'd be welcomed in your cult.

573
00:42:51,615 --> 00:42:52,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Pooping rainbows.

574
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:53,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you can poop some rainbows in my cult.

575
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:54,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

576
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:55,960
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'll do.

577
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob is the high priest of rainbow poop.

578
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you make it sound so dignified.

579
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:04,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

580
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to those 14 folks.

581
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they'll bounce back eventually.

582
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:09,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

583
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:16,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in other fun news, there's another PSP firmware update.

584
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

585
00:43:19,322 --> 00:43:30,448
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember there was an exploit that was recently discovered using GripShift that would allow people to run homebrew on a PSP 3000 system.

586
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:33,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can imagine that this new...

587
00:43:35,951 --> 00:44:03,423
[SPEAKER_08]: 5.03 firmware addresses security vulnerabilities and basically it's layman's terms for we fixed the grip shift exploit now you can't do it anymore so if you want to run homebrew onto your you know PSP 3000 I suggest that you don't update your system yet and just wait for them to find another way the few more days before they figure out a way to put a custom firmware onto the PSP 3000 and then it won't matter how many days has it been since this came out

588
00:44:04,591 --> 00:44:06,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

589
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:41,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, you know, any other updates like, say, a 5.1 or 5.2 or something like that that change a few things, add a couple features.

590
00:44:41,672 --> 00:44:48,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Those they can incorporate pretty easy because they normally don't change the firmware too much from update to update.

591
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:51,557
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just adding different things or updating different PRXs and stuff.

592
00:44:52,654 --> 00:44:55,135
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a countdown that everyone thought that was Zelda.

593
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:19,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, I see.

594
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:31,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what it is, it actually ends up being a game that 30 plays a significant thing in the game because you play four different games, but you play them 30 seconds apiece.

595
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:49,467
[SPEAKER_07]: each of the four games has their own character, their own mode like one of them is a side scroller, one of them is a shooter one of them is a strategy game and one of them is an action game but you play them 30 seconds at a time and there's I guess some type of clock in the middle of the screen and then after the 30 seconds is up you go to another mini game

596
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:57,343
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but a game like WarioWare that's made up of nothing but 30 second games is actually kind of cool.

597
00:45:57,783 --> 00:46:00,286
[SPEAKER_07]: So this could be very interesting.

598
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:00,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

599
00:46:01,287 --> 00:46:02,768
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very Japan.

600
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:05,071
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wonder if they'll bring it over here.

601
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:06,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like it could be kind of cool.

602
00:46:08,241 --> 00:46:10,342
[SPEAKER_07]: GameGuru says so it's WarioWare with less games.

603
00:46:10,662 --> 00:46:11,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, not necessarily.

604
00:46:12,843 --> 00:46:18,085
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be that the mini-games are all different types of side-scrolling games, different types of shooting games.

605
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:22,747
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would say it's like a WarioWare meets an RPG, like Actdeft says.

606
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:24,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds a little bit like it.

607
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:24,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

608
00:46:25,128 --> 00:46:27,369
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be hard to say until I can actually play the game, right?

609
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:28,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we'll see.

610
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,050
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be coming out eventually.

611
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:34,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's something for...

612
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:38,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor mill, if we don't mind.

613
00:46:38,284 --> 00:46:39,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm sorry, that's not a rumor mill.

614
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:42,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at the wrong story.

615
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:44,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no.

616
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just pissed off over my USB gloves.

617
00:46:48,704 --> 00:46:49,564
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not warming up.

618
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:51,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I have USB handwarming gloves.

619
00:46:51,925 --> 00:46:54,307
[SPEAKER_07]: How exactly hot can USB handwarming gloves get?

620
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:58,509
[SPEAKER_02]: They get freaking hot because I've got the cheap shitty ones that don't have any padding on the inside.

621
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I'm going to burn your palms now.

622
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:06,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to use them with my USB hub and they don't get as hot using my hub.

623
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so how about some Wipeout Love?

624
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:10,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipeout

625
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:53,219
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP, as you know, just want to PS2 PS2, sorry Bringing Wipeout to PS2 It's actually got the information from a European release list So, hey, maybe that could be it It's actually Wipeout Pulse, sorry And also, other things on that particular list One of them is Fat Princess to be out in March I really don't know

626
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:56,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Wipeout Pulse is the PSP going to the PS2?

627
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:56,835
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense then.

628
00:48:18,351 --> 00:48:19,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, we'll see.

629
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:20,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I like the Wipeout games.

630
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:22,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the download one.

631
00:48:22,555 --> 00:48:23,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the NegCon.

632
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:26,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to have another reason to use it.

633
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's some other games coming out in case you can't wait until March.

634
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:42,684
[SPEAKER_08]: This week there's a few games starting off with MLB Front Office Manager on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.

635
00:48:43,744 --> 00:48:47,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of the baseball take on NFL Head Coach.

636
00:48:48,165 --> 00:48:53,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on PS3 and Xbox 360, Afro Samurai coming to us from Namco Bandai.

637
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:55,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks pretty cool.

638
00:48:56,188 --> 00:48:57,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Very bloody.

639
00:48:58,428 --> 00:49:22,861
[SPEAKER_08]: movie tie-in game Coraline coming out on the Wii and PS2 I don't think there's a DS for that looks okay on DS, Imagine Cheerleader yet another game geared towards girls and then kind of a neat little DS game The Chase, Felix meets Felicity this is supposed to play a little bit like Kirby's Canvas Curse

640
00:49:23,781 --> 00:49:24,821
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Max Fever on PSP this week

641
00:49:54,455 --> 00:50:11,809
[SPEAKER_08]: and some games that people are not waiting for JoJo's Fashion Show for the DS and Pets Horses Ranch on DS as well and also supposedly this week although I think it's next week Rygar the Battle of Argus on the Wii

642
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:13,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is it.

643
00:50:39,241 --> 00:50:40,021
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

644
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:57,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't recognize any of these songs.

645
00:50:57,668 --> 00:51:01,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize DJ Max fans recognize these songs in the Korean version of the game.

646
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,572
[SPEAKER_07]: But they already import the Korean version.

647
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:07,435
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to understand, you are like the minority of the minority of the minority of video game buyers.

648
00:51:07,836 --> 00:51:08,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

649
00:51:08,756 --> 00:51:13,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the rest of those people, what is going to be the incentive for them to buy this game?

650
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:15,321
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

651
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:16,302
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no incentive.

652
00:51:17,743 --> 00:51:19,204
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know, and some people scoff.

653
00:51:19,304 --> 00:51:21,246
[SPEAKER_07]: What, licensed songs in DJ Max?

654
00:51:21,726 --> 00:51:23,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, do they want to sell it or not?

655
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:24,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

656
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:32,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of surprised that with them trying to put out this game in the US, they don't want to give me something I would know.

657
00:51:34,152 --> 00:51:44,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I respect DJ Max, I understand why he has such a loyal following and all that stuff, but they're not going to win over any new people with this strategy.

658
00:51:44,494 --> 00:51:45,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

659
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:45,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

660
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:49,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's just me.

661
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:55,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I just like to add before you start Japanese release dates.

662
00:51:55,569 --> 00:51:57,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And this kind of ties in with Japanese release dates.

663
00:51:58,149 --> 00:52:02,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I pre-ordered the Blu-ray of Advent Children.

664
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:05,411
[SPEAKER_08]: The one with Final Fantasy XIII.

665
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:06,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The demo.

666
00:52:07,112 --> 00:52:09,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm having that bitch overnighted when it comes out.

667
00:52:09,772 --> 00:52:10,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

668
00:52:10,492 --> 00:52:11,253
[SPEAKER_08]: When does that come out?

669
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:11,813
[SPEAKER_07]: April.

670
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:13,393
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be awesome.

671
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:16,434
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have Final Fantasy...

672
00:52:16,974 --> 00:52:17,314
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

673
00:52:33,068 --> 00:52:34,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he did Saw 2 and 3 and all that.

674
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:35,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those movies are kind of dumb.

675
00:52:36,209 --> 00:52:38,010
[SPEAKER_07]: But this movie was awesome.

676
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:43,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a 70s glam rock, but it's like an opera and it's a horror movie.

677
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:44,072
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

678
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:46,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I just wanted to say that because you saying Blu-ray reminded me of that.

679
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:48,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Comments from chat.

680
00:52:49,274 --> 00:52:50,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I went on that thing about DJ Max.

681
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,536
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68, who I know is a big DJ Max fan.

682
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:57,018
[SPEAKER_07]: He called and did the review on the arcade version before on the show.

683
00:52:57,378 --> 00:52:58,878
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, it's DJ Max.

684
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't expect licensed song.

685
00:53:00,922 --> 00:53:03,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know you don't, but again, you're the minority.

686
00:53:03,904 --> 00:53:05,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Surely you understand that.

687
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:19,073
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like back in the day, there weren't that many licensed songs in DDR, whereas fans of DDR didn't care if they brought out a DDR game over here that had no licensed songs, just all Konami artists.

688
00:53:19,954 --> 00:53:26,638
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're trying to expand your audience or bring it over to basically introduce people that haven't played,

689
00:53:27,695 --> 00:53:28,356
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Maxx.

690
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:31,340
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easier to do that with songs that they may recognize.

691
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,522
[SPEAKER_08]: They can go, hey, oh, this is in there.

692
00:53:33,582 --> 00:53:34,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I can play this.

693
00:53:35,044 --> 00:53:37,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be successful.

694
00:53:37,587 --> 00:53:42,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, look at Beatmania, which tried to do that as well, and that didn't work out too well.

695
00:53:43,093 --> 00:53:44,715
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

696
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:56,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, but the thing is, though, that, you know, again, DDR didn't really gain steam here until well into the PlayStation 2 mixes.

697
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:56,518
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

698
00:53:56,538 --> 00:54:00,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we had that first mix on PlayStation, which was, you know, even the fans laughed at it.

699
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:04,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Konomics, which was basically fan service, nothing but.

700
00:54:04,463 --> 00:54:08,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we started getting into, like, you know, DDR Max on the PlayStation 2.

701
00:54:08,966 --> 00:54:14,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And then really, I think probably about Max 2 was when we really started to see, like, a lot more licensed songs in the U.S.

702
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,571
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR games.

703
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:17,392
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also when the game took off.

704
00:54:18,413 --> 00:54:19,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Really took off.

705
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:22,076
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the first few games showed that it was probable.

706
00:54:22,436 --> 00:54:24,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the same thing will happen with DJ Max.

707
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:25,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

708
00:54:25,659 --> 00:54:26,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But we'll see.

709
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:27,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

710
00:54:28,422 --> 00:54:34,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if anything, what will help DJ Max will be DJ Max Technica when it comes out on the DS.

711
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:36,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they decide to bring that over here.

712
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:39,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's a lot more people that play the DS and...

713
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:41,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Ninja Blade on the Xbox 360 January 29th

714
00:55:01,152 --> 00:55:01,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fun.

715
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:05,975
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as Tom Clancy's End War and Tomb Raider Underworld come out on the Xbox 360.

716
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:13,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Heading over to the PlayStation 3, Tomb Raider Underworld also shows up in Japan, as well as Lost Planet Extreme Condition getting a price reduction.

717
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's in Japan.

718
00:55:15,861 --> 00:55:20,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time.

719
00:55:20,204 --> 00:55:22,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I anticipate there'll probably be a few people who'll want to import that sucker.

720
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:25,688
[SPEAKER_07]: That finally shows up on the Nintendo Wii.

721
00:55:25,748 --> 00:55:26,848
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been forever.

722
00:55:27,068 --> 00:55:29,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't Crystal Chronicles supposed to be a launch game?

723
00:55:30,177 --> 00:55:31,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

724
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's kind of changed quite a bit.

725
00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:41,582
[SPEAKER_07]: On the PlayStation 2, hey, funny, wouldn't you know it, Dance Dance Revolution X gets its debut in Japan this week on the PlayStation 2.

726
00:55:42,142 --> 00:55:44,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Japanese versions are always better somehow.

727
00:55:45,104 --> 00:55:49,106
[SPEAKER_07]: AR Tenelico 2, Melody of Metaphalica Premium Edition comes out.

728
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,767
[SPEAKER_08]: See, you didn't butcher that like I did last week.

729
00:55:52,407 --> 00:55:52,627
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

730
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:56,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I said he didn't butcher that like I did last week.

731
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:56,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

732
00:55:57,231 --> 00:56:01,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Soul Eater Battle Resonance comes out in Japan.

733
00:56:01,213 --> 00:56:01,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want?

734
00:56:02,574 --> 00:56:03,515
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this game all about?

735
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:06,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off of a manga that's pretty hardcore cool.

736
00:56:06,457 --> 00:56:06,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

737
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:08,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to build the ultimate weapon.

738
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:14,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Also a game called Harukanaro Toki no Naka de Yumi no Kuhihashi comes out.

739
00:56:14,803 --> 00:56:16,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Special comes out as well.

740
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:19,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea, but that's from Koei, so I bet anything it's some type of RPG game.

741
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:27,024
[SPEAKER_07]: It was previously released on the Nintendo DS to celebrate Koei's 30th anniversary.

742
00:56:28,064 --> 00:56:31,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Some more scenes that now have voiced and all that, so it's a DS game upgrade.

743
00:56:33,048 --> 00:56:38,291
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time also gets its release on the DS this week in Japan.

744
00:56:38,751 --> 00:56:45,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Civilization Revolution gets a localized release for Japan, as well as a game called Vampire Kishi DS comes out from D3.

745
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Sims 2 gets a price reduction over in Japan, if you haven't checked that out yet and you want to.

746
00:56:50,879 --> 00:57:01,867
[SPEAKER_07]: and lastly on the Sony PSP, Memories Off number 5, Togireta Film comes out as well as Princess Maker 4 Portable gets a price reduction.

747
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:11,353
[SPEAKER_07]: But probably the price reduction you're more interested in is Rockman Dash and Rockman Dash 2 coming out together in a value pack this week in Japan.

748
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:19,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, by the way, actually a couple other games, Soul Eater Battle Resonance gets released on the PSP and Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2.

749
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:22,750
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it, your Japanese release dates.

750
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:28,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on over to the kingdom that is united.

751
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:29,495
[SPEAKER_07]: The UK.

752
00:57:31,676 --> 00:57:31,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

753
00:57:33,277 --> 00:57:34,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, really not a whole lot of anything.

754
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Two games on the 30th.

755
00:57:36,259 --> 00:57:40,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Cake Mania 2 and The Chase Felix Meets Felicity.

756
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:43,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Cake Mania.

757
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:45,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And Felix Meets Felicity.

758
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:47,507
[SPEAKER_07]: These sound like real winners.

759
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:47,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

760
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:49,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Chase is supposed to be pretty good.

761
00:57:49,578 --> 00:57:50,299
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's Felix the cat.

762
00:57:50,779 --> 00:57:52,201
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's the Chase.

763
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:53,863
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that one that's coming out in the US also.

764
00:57:54,043 --> 00:57:54,864
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked okay.

765
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:58,488
[SPEAKER_08]: It's different, but is different appreciated?

766
00:57:58,668 --> 00:57:59,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Not always.

767
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

768
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you have it.

769
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:02,212
[SPEAKER_07]: UK release dates.

770
00:58:03,649 --> 00:58:06,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Something else that might be appreciated is the new PopCap game, Peggle.

771
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:10,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not that new, but it's new to Xbox Live Arcade.

772
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:16,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be coming out in the first half of 2009, if I were to guess, probably March, since I think that's when the DS version comes out.

773
00:58:16,718 --> 00:58:24,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's also when the new PopCap Arcade hits, Volume 2, which also features Peggle.

774
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:27,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So it makes sense that it would come out before that.

775
00:58:29,093 --> 00:58:29,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha.

776
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:30,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

777
00:58:30,355 --> 00:58:31,236
[SPEAKER_08]: There's logic for you.

778
00:58:32,357 --> 00:58:33,879
[SPEAKER_08]: No word on what the price is going to be.

779
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently people are thinking though that it's going to be 800 Microsoft points.

780
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:40,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes perfect sense because I think all the other PopCap games were also 10 bucks.

781
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:43,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you hear about the leak on Twitter about the iPhone version of Peggle?

782
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:46,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's really a leak.

783
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:58,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I thought that news was kind of already out there, but apparently they made a tweet about the iPhone pay goal, which, by the way, I believe was in response to our very own DJ Tyrant, who used to do a show on our old station.

784
00:58:59,064 --> 00:59:02,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember, because I follow PopCap and DJ on Instagram.

785
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:30,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Twitter, and he said something about like I was just playing Peggle, the game is fun or something like that, I wish I had it on the iPhone or whatever, and then PopCap I think made that response, I don't remember, I'm sorry if I'm misappropriating this information, but I remember it came up right after that conversation, is that PopCap made this tweet like, oh yeah, it's going to come out on the iPhone, and then the tweet disappeared and all the game blogs jumped on it but I was always kind of like, I thought they had already said that Peggle was going to come out on the iPhone, I mean, duh

786
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, do you watch much CNN?

787
00:59:56,118 --> 01:00:01,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I read CNN.com, but I don't watch, like I reload that a lot at work, but I don't watch the station.

788
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:15,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say, I think it's the Situation Room, but one of the programs on there actually reads comments off Twitter, the CNN Twitter, and responds to comments about stories that are going on.

789
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:16,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we used to do that.

790
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:17,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like how we use our chat room.

791
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:18,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's crazy.

792
01:00:18,723 --> 01:00:20,984
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to do the Twit thing, but we stopped.

793
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:23,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, you know what's funny?

794
01:00:23,212 --> 01:00:24,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to bring back the Twitter thing tonight.

795
01:00:25,032 --> 01:00:25,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not just saying that.

796
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:26,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, I already had it reloaded.

797
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:28,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Already here on the screen, ready to go.

798
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:29,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to do it during the break.

799
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:31,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright.

800
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:33,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, yeah.

801
01:00:33,116 --> 01:00:34,877
[SPEAKER_07]: We are bringing back the Twitter interactivity today.

802
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:38,438
[SPEAKER_08]: There are things that I normally post on my Twitter that are news related.

803
01:00:39,939 --> 01:00:40,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for reminding me.

804
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely forgot about it.

805
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,161
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you post on your Twitter?

806
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:45,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I go back and read them on air?

807
01:00:45,962 --> 01:00:46,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Go right ahead.

808
01:00:46,822 --> 01:00:47,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

809
01:00:48,503 --> 01:00:48,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

810
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:50,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see.

811
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:52,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't remember.

812
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes, a lot of the things you write on Twitter, you've already told me about in the past.

813
01:00:57,622 --> 01:00:58,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes.

814
01:00:59,142 --> 01:01:00,162
[SPEAKER_07]: You talked about Scratch.

815
01:01:00,503 --> 01:01:00,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

816
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the Lego game!

817
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:04,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody caught that one, huh?

818
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,945
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

819
01:01:07,005 --> 01:01:10,586
[SPEAKER_07]: You figured out Lego Rock Band is shit, and you know what the new Lego game is.

820
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:10,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

821
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:11,707
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to find out?

822
01:01:11,747 --> 01:01:12,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Go find Loki's Twitter.

823
01:01:13,027 --> 01:01:13,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to read it for you.

824
01:01:15,888 --> 01:01:16,768
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably just one of them.

825
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:18,329
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

826
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:20,889
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

827
01:01:46,064 --> 01:01:53,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing Else Matters, One, Seek and Destroy, Memory Remains, hopefully with Marianne Faithfull intact because that song is awesome because of her.

828
01:01:54,688 --> 01:01:57,990
[SPEAKER_07]: The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Whiplash.

829
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:06,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other artists that are showing up in the game, Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Foo Fighters, Judas Priest, Leonard Skitterd.

830
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:08,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Turn the Page?

831
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:09,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's Turn the Page.

832
01:02:10,676 --> 01:02:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't they just do Metallica's cover?

833
01:02:13,473 --> 01:02:26,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know Leonard Skinner is in it Motorhead Ace of Spades Yes, Ace of Spades Queen with Stone Cold Crazy You know what?

834
01:02:27,137 --> 01:02:28,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I just figured it out What?

835
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:33,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all songs that Metallica has covered I think a lot of these are, yeah

836
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:35,770
[SPEAKER_02]: The Garage Inc.

837
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:36,891
[SPEAKER_02]: album, remember?

838
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:38,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

839
01:02:38,673 --> 01:02:40,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they've done Stone Cold Crazy.

840
01:02:41,015 --> 01:02:42,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've got it on my phone.

841
01:02:42,817 --> 01:02:43,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

842
01:02:43,357 --> 01:02:47,621
[SPEAKER_02]: They've done the other one.

843
01:02:48,762 --> 01:02:50,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Ace of Spades?

844
01:02:51,485 --> 01:02:55,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if they did Ace of Spades, but I know that they did Turn the Page.

845
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:58,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's one of my favorite covers of that song ever.

846
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:05,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Also Slayer, Social Distortion, System of a Down, Thin Lizzy, lots of stuff in here.

847
01:03:06,611 --> 01:03:09,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to also mention, this is what I thought was kind of interesting also.

848
01:03:10,432 --> 01:03:18,855
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have the download content that was the Death Magnetic CD for download, it will actually work the 10 tracks into the game's campaign mode.

849
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:27,460
[SPEAKER_07]: If you already own World Tour on Wii or PlayStation 2, you'll get Broken, Beaten, Scarred, Cyanide, and My Apocalypse.

850
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:34,305
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll already be on the disc for you since download content is kind of different on Wii and PlayStation 2.

851
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:36,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that kind of interaction was interesting.

852
01:03:36,987 --> 01:03:47,434
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also announced that the game will be coming on PS3 and Xbox 360 at the end of March on the 29th and then the PS2 and Wii later.

853
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:57,515
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now the question, this isn't set up like World Tour with the other instrument setups or anything, is it?

854
01:03:57,535 --> 01:03:57,835
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is.

855
01:03:58,095 --> 01:04:00,436
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically with all, like Rock Band now.

856
01:04:00,896 --> 01:04:01,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, damn it.

857
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:03,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to buy it.

858
01:04:03,378 --> 01:04:04,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's Metallica.

859
01:04:05,859 --> 01:04:06,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

860
01:04:06,979 --> 01:04:08,880
[SPEAKER_07]: What role will Metallica play in your cult?

861
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:11,762
[SPEAKER_02]: The official band of the universe.

862
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:15,110
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

863
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:16,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Not interested.

864
01:04:16,971 --> 01:04:17,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

865
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:18,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I quit your cult.

866
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:18,991
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

867
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought ABBA got to be the official band of the universe.

868
01:04:23,453 --> 01:04:24,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very disappointed.

869
01:04:25,934 --> 01:04:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: ABBA gets official pop band of the universe.

870
01:04:28,635 --> 01:04:28,915
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

871
01:04:28,955 --> 01:04:29,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

872
01:04:29,475 --> 01:04:30,715
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that would be a game right there.

873
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:33,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Tweak62 says 80s Metallica is great.

874
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,177
[SPEAKER_08]: 90s Metallica is pretty okay.

875
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:39,818
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have a game where 80s Metallica battles 90s Metallica and see who wins.

876
01:04:40,098 --> 01:04:41,659
[SPEAKER_07]: How about ABBA versus Metallica?

877
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:44,417
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be a game.

878
01:04:44,557 --> 01:04:46,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Alas, Abba, we knew you well.

879
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,561
[SPEAKER_02]: As you get stomped in the face by Lars Ulrich.

880
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,282
[SPEAKER_07]: No, all Abba would have to do is dress Metallica.

881
01:04:55,964 --> 01:04:56,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

882
01:04:57,845 --> 01:04:59,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with more news.

883
01:05:00,186 --> 01:05:00,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we gotta?

884
01:05:01,046 --> 01:05:01,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.

885
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:02,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what we do on this show.

886
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:03,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you heard.

887
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:04,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual Console!

888
01:05:05,189 --> 01:05:05,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey.

889
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:07,850
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff out.

890
01:05:09,091 --> 01:05:10,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is UK stuff, right?

891
01:05:10,211 --> 01:05:10,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I like stuff.

892
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:21,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out to Virtual Console in the UK is Mario Golf for 1,000 Wii Points because it was a Nintendo 64 game.

893
01:05:22,097 --> 01:05:27,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And Wonder Boy and Monster Land from the Sega Master System, which will be 500 Wii Points.

894
01:05:27,959 --> 01:05:28,639
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

895
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,440
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just playing that like...

896
01:05:31,935 --> 01:05:33,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan brought out the Master System.

897
01:05:33,837 --> 01:05:34,918
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just playing this the other day.

898
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:35,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

899
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been following Virtual Console in the U.S.

900
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:38,200
[SPEAKER_02]: What did we get?

901
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember?

902
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:39,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

903
01:05:54,129 --> 01:05:54,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

904
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:55,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't buy anything on Virtual Console.

905
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:56,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't either.

906
01:05:56,672 --> 01:05:57,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time.

907
01:05:57,393 --> 01:06:03,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I haven't fired up the Wii in a while either, now that I've ruined Animal Crossing for my wife again.

908
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:05,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Did your wife officially quit Animal Crossing?

909
01:06:05,763 --> 01:06:07,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she's done with it because I ruined it for her.

910
01:06:07,685 --> 01:06:08,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I started cheating.

911
01:06:08,586 --> 01:06:09,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to hear it.

912
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:12,334
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because, you know, I got bored with it.

913
01:06:12,914 --> 01:06:14,374
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing more I can really do.

914
01:06:14,414 --> 01:06:15,755
[SPEAKER_08]: What else was there to do but cheat?

915
01:06:16,395 --> 01:06:16,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

916
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:17,815
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun to cheat.

917
01:06:17,835 --> 01:06:18,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun to steal.

918
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:24,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when those animals piss you off because they're being just assholes, and you just go into their house and steal all their shit.

919
01:06:24,677 --> 01:06:25,358
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ha!

920
01:06:25,998 --> 01:06:27,538
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you steal their stuff?

921
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:31,860
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a code where you can pick up their stuff, furniture, move it around.

922
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:35,981
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing is it doesn't save it, I don't think, so you can't just do that.

923
01:06:36,974 --> 01:06:44,564
[SPEAKER_08]: But it did, sort of, in the game that we played, because I stole all the stuff and they had, like, crap on the floor and I was just, like, random junk that...

924
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:47,642
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I would love to see?

925
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:50,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a while since we've had an OLR dream game.

926
01:06:51,324 --> 01:06:59,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see a game that kind of takes that art style of Animal Crossing or what have you and mixes it with Grand Theft Auto.

927
01:06:59,889 --> 01:07:01,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on the same page with you.

928
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,332
[SPEAKER_07]: When a villager pisses me off, I want to put a hit on him.

929
01:07:05,452 --> 01:07:09,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you're basically saying is you would like to see a game that's like Grand Theft Auto.

930
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even say Happy Tree Friends because that shit ain't going to cut it.

931
01:07:13,882 --> 01:07:15,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

932
01:07:43,737 --> 01:07:44,557
[SPEAKER_07]: or something like that.

933
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:47,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Or animal taking.

934
01:07:47,919 --> 01:07:50,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be able to kidnap animals.

935
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:52,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

936
01:07:55,062 --> 01:07:55,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

937
01:07:55,862 --> 01:07:58,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Other virtual console news, I guess.

938
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

939
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:03,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so... There's a brand new game coming out.

940
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:06,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like I made it or something, but it's not.

941
01:08:07,114 --> 01:08:08,555
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Super Meat Boy.

942
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:13,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's co-created by Edmund McMillan.

943
01:08:14,078 --> 01:08:14,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently...

944
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really sure what it is.

945
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:24,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's a Flash game, kind of similar to N Plus.

946
01:08:25,953 --> 01:08:31,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And it'll be coming out to the Virtual Console sometime soon, apparently.

947
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:32,582
[SPEAKER_08]: SuperMeatBoy.com

948
01:08:54,332 --> 01:08:58,374
[SPEAKER_07]: What if instead of calling it Super Meat Boy, they called it Super Bacon Boy?

949
01:08:58,854 --> 01:09:00,975
[SPEAKER_07]: This game would be the top... It doesn't look like bacon.

950
01:09:01,115 --> 01:09:05,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be the top selling... Well, they need to go back and edit the sprites or something and make it Super Bacon Boy.

951
01:09:05,436 --> 01:09:08,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it would be the top selling WiiWare game ever.

952
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, even more than Strong Bad and all that stuff.

953
01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:11,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Bacon Boy.

954
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,181
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big mistake, whoever made that decision to change bacon to meat.

955
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:20,362
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, yeah.

956
01:09:21,442 --> 01:09:23,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently it's extremely hard

957
01:09:25,714 --> 01:09:27,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it'll be a challenge then.

958
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:28,557
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't cut it, you don't cut it.

959
01:09:30,519 --> 01:09:31,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, give me a pretzel.

960
01:09:33,421 --> 01:09:34,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop making bad jokes and I will.

961
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:36,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew's not here to do it for us.

962
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,992
[SPEAKER_07]: No more free handouts, says GameTap.

963
01:09:40,112 --> 01:09:41,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And it happened on Thursday.

964
01:09:41,753 --> 01:09:45,454
[SPEAKER_07]: They removed 97 games from the free lineup of games.

965
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:57,259
[SPEAKER_07]: But look, in this economy and with the whole changing of the hands that went on over at GameTap, right, because Metabully bought them out or whatever, or I think they went up for sale and Metabully bought them, you knew some changes were going to come.

966
01:09:57,519 --> 01:10:03,222
[SPEAKER_07]: That's two-thirds of the free games are gone, including some games like Art of Fighting.

967
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:15,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Baseball Stars Professional, Bust a Move Again, Twinkle Star Strikes, Rainbow Islands, so on and so on.

968
01:10:15,952 --> 01:10:17,413
[SPEAKER_07]: No more free handouts for you.

969
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:21,957
[SPEAKER_07]: However, it should be pointed out, you can still play these games on GameTap.

970
01:10:22,478 --> 01:10:23,479
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to pay for it.

971
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:24,599
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

972
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,102
[SPEAKER_02]: This makes me even more not want to use our service.

973
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:36,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually considering signing up for GameTap, and now there's no point.

974
01:10:36,609 --> 01:10:37,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the games are there.

975
01:10:37,811 --> 01:10:38,752
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to pay for them now.

976
01:10:38,912 --> 01:10:41,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to pay for other games, but I don't want to play for shit I already own.

977
01:10:43,137 --> 01:10:44,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is damn near everything on that list.

978
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,741
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the good ones.

979
01:10:49,635 --> 01:10:50,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be honest.

980
01:10:50,316 --> 01:10:54,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to talk a lot about GameTap on the show, but I did finally cancel my account a few months ago.

981
01:10:54,878 --> 01:10:55,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wasn't playing it enough.

982
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:58,720
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that I'm not playing WoW, who knows?

983
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to go back.

984
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:00,421
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

985
01:11:01,442 --> 01:11:03,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And plus, I was a little sad I couldn't play Myst Online anymore.

986
01:11:04,863 --> 01:11:10,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it was weird, the game was very weird, there was something about it that made me want to play it once in a while.

987
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:11,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something that you should play.

988
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:13,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I found my DVD copy of Pissed.

989
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:14,809
[SPEAKER_07]: God.

990
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:15,849
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the parody of Myst.

991
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually remembered that game, sadly.

992
01:11:19,271 --> 01:11:20,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere I've got Monty Python.

993
01:11:20,212 --> 01:11:21,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complete waste of time.

994
01:11:21,932 --> 01:11:24,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I've got a few more stories for you guys and we're going to get to our break tonight.

995
01:11:25,934 --> 01:11:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this next story is Lost Planet.

996
01:11:32,137 --> 01:11:33,117
[SPEAKER_07]: News on the sequel, finally?

997
01:11:34,018 --> 01:11:34,938
[SPEAKER_02]: News on the movie.

998
01:11:35,898 --> 01:11:39,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, now this is what Capcom spent their whole E3 talking about, right?

999
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,922
[SPEAKER_02]: They are saying that it's going to cost between $150 to $200 million dollars.

1000
01:11:50,357 --> 01:11:55,261
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's just a crazy, crazy, crazy ass budget.

1001
01:11:56,903 --> 01:12:00,105
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you know why it's going to be completely awesome?

1002
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:03,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It's written by David Hayter.

1003
01:12:03,828 --> 01:12:05,109
[SPEAKER_07]: The voice of Solid Snake.

1004
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't Titanic made for like $180 million or something?

1005
01:12:10,475 --> 01:12:13,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, in that Pearl Harbor movie, was that it?

1006
01:12:13,777 --> 01:12:16,738
[SPEAKER_07]: That cost like a shit ton of money to make.

1007
01:12:16,758 --> 01:12:18,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It cost like $200 million.

1008
01:12:18,579 --> 01:12:19,880
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's written by David Hayter.

1009
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:25,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, I understand that, but most moviegoers have no idea who the fuck he is.

1010
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:28,324
[SPEAKER_07]: He might be like a prince in your cult or whatever.

1011
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The first X-Men movie.

1012
01:12:30,085 --> 01:12:30,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right, he did.

1013
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:32,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, he did.

1014
01:12:32,386 --> 01:12:33,366
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a good one.

1015
01:12:33,586 --> 01:12:34,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I stand corrected.

1016
01:12:34,667 --> 01:12:36,308
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, that's a big budget.

1017
01:12:37,688 --> 01:12:38,809
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big risk.

1018
01:12:40,503 --> 01:12:41,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it pays off for him.

1019
01:12:41,844 --> 01:12:43,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so, because it's David Hader.

1020
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:48,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it's directed by the guy who did Spider-Man.

1021
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:50,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam Raimi?

1022
01:12:52,088 --> 01:12:56,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Avi, I read the... Sorry, produced, not directed.

1023
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:56,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say.

1024
01:12:58,251 --> 01:12:59,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're talking Army of Darkness here.

1025
01:12:59,731 --> 01:13:02,072
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I meant produced.

1026
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:03,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we'll see.

1027
01:13:05,779 --> 01:13:07,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was checking out Super Meat Boy.

1028
01:13:07,965 --> 01:13:10,171
[SPEAKER_08]: It's exactly like N+.

1029
01:13:10,271 --> 01:13:11,313
[SPEAKER_08]: You were playing with your meat, Loki?

1030
01:13:11,614 --> 01:13:12,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was playing with my meat.

1031
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:14,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It's exactly like...

1032
01:13:14,963 --> 01:13:17,705
[SPEAKER_08]: During the show... Loki, I know.

1033
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:19,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So unexpected of me.

1034
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:23,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.

1035
01:13:23,428 --> 01:13:26,730
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an announcement made this week.

1036
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:30,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember everyone was saying, hey, what happened to the Indiana Jones game?

1037
01:13:31,753 --> 01:13:37,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that Indiana Jones game that they were showing us before, not coming out, at least right now...

1038
01:13:38,757 --> 01:13:39,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings

1039
01:13:55,254 --> 01:14:13,586
[SPEAKER_08]: so that's pretty cool apparently though they said that it's also been rated for the PSP and possibly they're thinking PS2 because if it's coming to the PSP they pour a lot of games over to the PS2 anyways so very very cool

1040
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:16,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's translated to this.

1041
01:14:32,626 --> 01:14:33,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1042
01:14:34,046 --> 01:14:37,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what it is, a golden raspberry award.

1043
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:44,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they literally dip something in cheap gold plating or something and they valued the award at like $5 or something like that.

1044
01:14:44,509 --> 01:14:48,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they give away these Razzie awards to the worst of the worst movies of the year.

1045
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:53,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I read somewhere this year The Love Guru got nominated for more Razzies than any other movie.

1046
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:55,232
[SPEAKER_07]: That was that Mike Myers movie that came out during the summer.

1047
01:14:55,252 --> 01:14:55,732
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people...

1048
01:14:56,232 --> 01:14:57,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1049
01:15:16,021 --> 01:15:20,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, he might win that, but it might, you know, Love Guru did get 10 nominations, so it might beat it.

1050
01:15:21,285 --> 01:15:22,806
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the other thing you should recognize.

1051
01:15:23,246 --> 01:15:26,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Uwe Boll has been guaranteed an award at the ceremony.

1052
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:31,713
[SPEAKER_07]: He is going to earn the Lifetime Recognition Award of Worst Career Achievement.

1053
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:35,714
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all the clap he earns.

1054
01:15:36,394 --> 01:15:38,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Linda Blair has earned this award.

1055
01:15:39,056 --> 01:15:40,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Erwin R. Allen earned this award.

1056
01:15:41,257 --> 01:15:43,679
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ronald Reagan once earned this award as well.

1057
01:15:43,699 --> 01:15:45,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember, he was an actor before he did all that other stuff.

1058
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:54,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So Uwe Boll is going to be getting a type of Lifetime Achievement Award from the Razzies for his shit-tacious films.

1059
01:15:56,812 --> 01:15:57,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1060
01:15:57,672 --> 01:16:01,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations to Uwe Boll for finally getting recognized with a Hollywood Movie Award.

1061
01:16:02,995 --> 01:16:07,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he can say, but now, see, now he can say the award winning Uwe Boll in his movies.

1062
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:08,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he won shit.

1063
01:16:08,818 --> 01:16:09,398
[SPEAKER_07]: There he goes.

1064
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:12,700
[SPEAKER_02]: They should just poop and dip it in gold and give it to him.

1065
01:16:13,905 --> 01:16:14,405
[SPEAKER_07]: They just might.

1066
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But now the question is, will he show up to collect it in person?

1067
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:19,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Because some people have a sense of humor about it.

1068
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:21,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Very few people go to collect their awards in person.

1069
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:27,874
[SPEAKER_07]: But Halle Berry actually showed up the year she won Worst Actress and Catwoman.

1070
01:16:28,314 --> 01:16:33,758
[SPEAKER_07]: She actually showed up to collect the award in person and told off the people in the crowd, but in a joking way.

1071
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:39,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's cool that she could be self... She recognized that the movie was shit and could kind of make fun of herself.

1072
01:16:40,022 --> 01:16:40,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know...

1073
01:16:40,902 --> 01:16:42,003
[SPEAKER_07]: You always have to kind of laugh at that.

1074
01:16:42,343 --> 01:16:46,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I recall correctly, didn't Uwe Boll show up at Penny Arcade Expo in 07?

1075
01:16:46,826 --> 01:16:48,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Or something like that?

1076
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:51,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when they couldn't get Jack Thompson, they got Uwe Boll and he came out on stage?

1077
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:57,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with all the shit that guy gets, that takes guts.

1078
01:16:58,092 --> 01:16:58,893
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a boxer.

1079
01:16:59,834 --> 01:17:01,675
[SPEAKER_07]: YYR in our chatroom is convinced he will.

1080
01:17:01,735 --> 01:17:02,395
[SPEAKER_07]: He will pick it up.

1081
01:17:02,435 --> 01:17:03,716
[SPEAKER_07]: He loves to be in front of the camera.

1082
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:05,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Media whore!

1083
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,528
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't a word for you being bad.

1084
01:17:35,628 --> 01:17:37,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I hope that wasn't Pierce Brosnan and Mamma Mia.

1085
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:41,654
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare they give Mamma Mia a Razzie nomination.

1086
01:17:41,694 --> 01:17:42,335
[SPEAKER_07]: How dare they.

1087
01:17:45,098 --> 01:17:47,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I realize Pierce Brosnan was pretty shitty in that movie.

1088
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:49,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Why isn't that nominated for Best Picture, Rob?

1089
01:17:49,263 --> 01:17:50,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm wondering.

1090
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:50,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

1091
01:17:55,493 --> 01:17:56,554
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1092
01:18:23,755 --> 01:18:24,416
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.

1093
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,357
[SPEAKER_07]: What should the kids be playing this week?

1094
01:18:27,118 --> 01:18:30,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The game of the week is Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

1095
01:18:31,903 --> 01:18:34,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, if kind of dumb.

1096
01:18:34,265 --> 01:18:36,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it up a little bit, Rob.

1097
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:38,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the intro music.

1098
01:18:47,688 --> 01:18:55,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now the Alex Kidd games were their own little fun dinky platformers.

1099
01:18:56,270 --> 01:19:03,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex Kidd in Shinobi World was an attempt that Sega wanted to do to actually parody their own titles.

1100
01:19:03,251 --> 01:19:09,513
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how there was Parodius for Gradius and Kidd Dracula for the Castlevania series.

1101
01:19:10,473 --> 01:19:14,154
[SPEAKER_02]: The game was originally going to be called, it was actually Shinobi Kidd.

1102
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,898
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was just going to be a parody.

1103
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:18,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear the music.

1104
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:22,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the music from...

1105
01:19:25,143 --> 01:19:26,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh, Shinobi.

1106
01:19:28,066 --> 01:19:28,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You here?

1107
01:19:29,407 --> 01:19:29,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1108
01:19:31,749 --> 01:19:36,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it was gonna be, yeah, like, just a cute little parody of, um, Shinobi.

1109
01:19:36,913 --> 01:19:44,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it ended up, uh, becoming an Alex Kidd game so that they could perpetuate series.

1110
01:19:44,099 --> 01:19:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, this was before we had Sonic.

1111
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:48,282
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Sega Master System era, y'all.

1112
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:53,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, but it was, uh, a little funny thing about it is that the first boss...

1113
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:56,129
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1114
01:20:17,924 --> 01:20:19,505
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's just a cute little platformer.

1115
01:20:19,525 --> 01:20:21,106
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got four stages in it.

1116
01:20:22,387 --> 01:20:28,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you have the Kabuto stage, Raid of the Helicopters, the Jungle, and Battle with the Dark Ninja.

1117
01:20:29,452 --> 01:20:32,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a pretty fun little game.

1118
01:20:32,514 --> 01:20:34,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I really always like playing this game.

1119
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:38,479
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do, since this is an Alex Kidd game, you have to do those damn Janken fights.

1120
01:20:40,189 --> 01:20:41,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually, Rob, I don't remember.

1121
01:20:41,991 --> 01:20:46,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know exactly how long it's been since I've played this game?

1122
01:20:47,818 --> 01:20:48,158
[SPEAKER_09]: A while.

1123
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to think about it.

1124
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:53,364
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll say a while.

1125
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:56,168
[SPEAKER_02]: My freshman year of college...

1126
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:04,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I traded all of my Nintendo systems for all of my friend's Sega systems for a week.

1127
01:21:05,759 --> 01:21:07,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so I could see what the big deal was.

1128
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,500
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I developed my Sega love.

1129
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:16,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I had his power base converter and played the shit out of this game and Castle of Illusion.

1130
01:21:18,015 --> 01:21:21,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the boss of this level looks kind of like the Opa-Opa, I get what you're saying.

1131
01:21:21,518 --> 01:21:21,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1132
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:22,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, funny.

1133
01:21:22,718 --> 01:21:22,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1134
01:21:24,019 --> 01:21:27,482
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big, fun, parody game.

1135
01:21:28,402 --> 01:21:29,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the music.

1136
01:21:29,603 --> 01:21:31,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's great.

1137
01:21:31,584 --> 01:21:34,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like- I really love a lot of the Sega Master System games.

1138
01:21:34,927 --> 01:21:39,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love the American boxes for them, just because they're so shitty and generic.

1139
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,272
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, like, cute artwork, blah blah!

1140
01:21:42,592 --> 01:21:43,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Grid background!

1141
01:21:45,461 --> 01:21:48,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this was an Alex Kidd game.

1142
01:21:49,424 --> 01:22:01,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I actually liked a lot of the other Alex Kidd games because there was the Alex Kidd Miracle World and High Tech World.

1143
01:22:01,832 --> 01:22:02,572
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another one.

1144
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:04,994
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one is actually my favorite of the Alex Kidd games.

1145
01:22:06,175 --> 01:22:07,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you have it.

1146
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:10,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Your classic game of the week, Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.

1147
01:22:12,765 --> 01:22:17,326
[SPEAKER_07]: A parody-rific game of some of Sega's great franchises.

1148
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:21,927
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to do it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.

1149
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:25,768
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got plenty more news to report on in Part B, so stick around, guys.

1150
01:22:26,148 --> 01:22:28,369
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1151
01:22:28,389 --> 01:22:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And hey, those of you that use Twitter, keep an eye out during this break.

1152
01:22:31,789 --> 01:22:32,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Show us your tweets.

1153
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:37,911
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll read some of your responses when we come back after this little break here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1154
01:22:44,963 --> 01:22:54,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 25th of 2009 with our 310th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1155
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:56,997
[SPEAKER_07]: These numbers are getting so high, it's just obscene.

1156
01:22:57,017 --> 01:22:58,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, that's starting with one.

1157
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing this a little while.

1158
01:23:01,262 --> 01:23:03,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, show us your tweets.

1159
01:23:04,386 --> 01:23:09,008
[SPEAKER_07]: We asked on Twitter during the break, what should Rob do now that he left World of Warcraft?

1160
01:23:09,048 --> 01:23:10,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And during the break, you guys responded.

1161
01:23:11,409 --> 01:23:13,430
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 says, get Castle Crashers.

1162
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, update the podcast in time.

1163
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:18,212
[SPEAKER_07]: That or play more games on Xbox Live Arcade.

1164
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:23,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Janai702 says, Rob should spend his leftover WoW subscription money on a super huge sandwich with bacon.

1165
01:23:24,435 --> 01:23:25,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Om nom nom nom.

1166
01:23:25,555 --> 01:23:26,636
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a very good idea.

1167
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:30,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Harry AKA says he should check himself into rehab before he relapses.

1168
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:35,643
[SPEAKER_07]: MistyOLR says, I don't know, work on the OLR shirts so I can do some pimping during Heisen.

1169
01:23:35,983 --> 01:23:36,523
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good idea.

1170
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Zakupilot256 says Rob should seek addiction counseling to prevent a relapse.

1171
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:46,107
[SPEAKER_07]: BlueSwim says Rob should play Kick the Ferret with, of course, the ferret.

1172
01:23:46,827 --> 01:23:48,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Just joking, DarkSakura.

1173
01:23:48,288 --> 01:23:48,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I heart the ferret.

1174
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:56,671
[SPEAKER_07]: X-Link 777 says, start a new drug habit or tossing a few tacos at people that don't like ABBA.

1175
01:23:58,092 --> 01:24:02,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it when we get last week's jokes incorporated into the show.

1176
01:24:03,033 --> 01:24:04,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, DarkSakura, I wish you were here for that story.

1177
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:10,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Some kid threw a taco at his mom over a video game.

1178
01:24:11,055 --> 01:24:12,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And he got sent to jail.

1179
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:14,335
[SPEAKER_07]: The mom called the police.

1180
01:24:14,755 --> 01:24:15,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The kid went to jail.

1181
01:24:15,716 --> 01:24:16,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking stupid.

1182
01:24:18,755 --> 01:24:20,216
[SPEAKER_07]: What a way to teach him a lesson, though.

1183
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Giovedea says, Doing anything is better than playing WoW.

1184
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:26,678
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkTetsuya says, Start the cult with DarkSakura.

1185
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,359
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Tyrant says, Play Persona 3 and 4.

1186
01:24:30,559 --> 01:24:33,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Had no idea Rob left because I'm playing WoW right now.

1187
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:40,163
[SPEAKER_07]: SchmittyDog says, Rob should either create an ABBA tribute band or work on his musical career.

1188
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:41,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard me sing?

1189
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:46,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Crozy says, He should make a WoW-themed level on LittleBigPlanet

1190
01:24:47,185 --> 01:25:01,375
[SPEAKER_07]: and hope it doesn't get taken down by moderation there actually was a wow theme level on LittleBigPlanet and it was actually kind of funny Biohaze20, last one I'm going to read here says wait until something better is out who knows when who knows when

1191
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe they're titling it this, but...

1192
01:25:24,184 --> 01:25:24,886
[SPEAKER_08]: TMNT Smash Up

1193
01:25:33,925 --> 01:25:35,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that is clever.

1194
01:25:36,846 --> 01:25:38,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Ubisoft, way to go.

1195
01:25:39,687 --> 01:25:45,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, it's going to feature arenas that will change throughout the battles.

1196
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:50,570
[SPEAKER_08]: You might remember something similar to Power Stone 2.

1197
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Or even Smash Bros., I guess.

1198
01:25:54,371 --> 01:25:58,572
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see players defeating their opponents either by knocking them off the stage...

1199
01:25:59,392 --> 01:26:03,742
[SPEAKER_08]: or by emptying their health meter entirely, which can be filled with pizza.

1200
01:26:04,904 --> 01:26:07,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, if this does not sound like a ripoff of Smash Bros.,

1201
01:26:09,608 --> 01:26:10,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll still play it.

1202
01:26:10,508 --> 01:26:11,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Turtles.

1203
01:26:11,128 --> 01:26:14,529
[SPEAKER_08]: But it says apparently this is now targeted for the Wii.

1204
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:16,890
[SPEAKER_08]: It says there will be no motion controlled attacks.

1205
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:22,331
[SPEAKER_08]: The waggle isn't ruled out for other aspects or context sensitive moves and stuff.

1206
01:26:22,451 --> 01:26:28,013
[SPEAKER_08]: It's described as dark and gritty as far as like the graphic style.

1207
01:26:28,693 --> 01:26:35,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess Turtles co-creator Peter Laird is penning the single story or single player story.

1208
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:37,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And

1209
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:42,638
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, currently, as far as the roster goes, Ninja Turtles and Splinter are confirmed.

1210
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:45,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1211
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:46,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1212
01:26:47,522 --> 01:26:47,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1213
01:26:47,882 --> 01:26:50,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's neat.

1214
01:26:52,031 --> 01:26:54,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I'm a little apprehensive about these type of games.

1215
01:26:54,253 --> 01:27:00,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll never be as good as it was right when the arcade game and the original NES game were out.

1216
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:01,318
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not.

1217
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:04,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The NES game blew.

1218
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:06,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay, but at least it had a good soundtrack.

1219
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,523
[SPEAKER_07]: But the arcade game was the best.

1220
01:27:08,703 --> 01:27:14,547
[SPEAKER_02]: The best home version of any Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is Turtles in Time.

1221
01:27:14,907 --> 01:27:15,488
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

1222
01:27:18,045 --> 01:27:18,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it to you.

1223
01:27:18,626 --> 01:27:19,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It was perfect.

1224
01:27:35,993 --> 01:27:37,115
[SPEAKER_07]: A new video game title.

1225
01:27:37,215 --> 01:27:38,497
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Metal God.

1226
01:27:39,098 --> 01:27:41,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was discovered, a trademark that was filed on January 11th.

1227
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:46,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It covers computer games, video games, and game controllers for computer games.

1228
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:46,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

1229
01:27:47,813 --> 01:27:48,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero ripoff?

1230
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:50,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Death Metal Hero

1231
01:28:12,571 --> 01:28:15,573
[SPEAKER_07]: That is kind of cool, but it's not the same thing as actually playing GWAR.

1232
01:28:16,013 --> 01:28:16,313
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

1233
01:28:16,693 --> 01:28:19,055
[SPEAKER_07]: So GWAR or GTFO?

1234
01:28:19,395 --> 01:28:20,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you're listening.

1235
01:28:20,176 --> 01:28:20,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Halford.

1236
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:25,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo!

1237
01:28:25,147 --> 01:28:25,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo!

1238
01:28:54,966 --> 01:28:56,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo Wars Halo Wars Halo Wars Halo Wars

1239
01:29:25,256 --> 01:29:26,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that Loki mode?

1240
01:29:26,898 --> 01:29:28,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to tutorial sometimes.

1241
01:29:29,562 --> 01:29:33,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Mirror's Edge because I can't remember what I'm supposed to be doing in that.

1242
01:29:34,693 --> 01:29:35,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Mirror's Edge is hard.

1243
01:29:59,912 --> 01:30:01,433
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have the Mythic Map Pack.

1244
01:30:02,433 --> 01:30:05,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know when the US version is to be out.

1245
01:30:06,174 --> 01:30:06,715
[SPEAKER_08]: March 3rd.

1246
01:30:06,975 --> 01:30:07,375
[SPEAKER_08]: March 3rd.

1247
01:30:07,675 --> 01:30:07,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1248
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:10,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like a freaking encyclopedia of games.

1249
01:30:10,936 --> 01:30:14,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, I don't like... Hey, it makes you great on the show.

1250
01:30:14,737 --> 01:30:15,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it makes you good.

1251
01:30:15,598 --> 01:30:19,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't know if that beta date is for us or for the UK.

1252
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:22,000
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely for the UK.

1253
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,141
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know if it applies to us as well.

1254
01:30:24,181 --> 01:30:25,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure it's a worldwide thing.

1255
01:30:25,601 --> 01:30:26,422
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the 5th for us, yeah.

1256
01:30:26,442 --> 01:30:26,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1257
01:30:27,694 --> 01:30:30,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check it out.

1258
01:30:31,077 --> 01:30:32,539
[SPEAKER_07]: I own all the Halo games.

1259
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:42,287
[SPEAKER_02]: There better, better, better, better, better be a Red vs. Blue introduction or something in it with Sarge.

1260
01:30:42,347 --> 01:30:44,209
[SPEAKER_07]: You want a reference somewhere in the game?

1261
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:44,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1262
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:45,390
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1263
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,831
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1264
01:30:45,851 --> 01:30:46,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a unit.

1265
01:30:46,731 --> 01:30:47,052
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1266
01:30:48,103 --> 01:30:49,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1267
01:31:00,427 --> 01:31:04,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about video game inspired fan tributes, I don't remember if I mentioned this on the show.

1268
01:31:04,530 --> 01:31:11,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I mentioned this before we went live, but something, believe it or not, I finally saw for the first time, ironically, the day I quit WoW, was The Guild.

1269
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:13,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you've ever seen this.

1270
01:31:14,056 --> 01:31:17,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this YouTube thing that kind of parodies the whole World of Warcraft.

1271
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:21,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I only saw the first little four-minute episode, but it's hilarious.

1272
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:23,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to tell you, people aren't that bad.

1273
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:26,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, some people are that bad, but I was never that bad.

1274
01:31:27,205 --> 01:31:28,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't you see Dr. Horrible's

1275
01:31:41,488 --> 01:31:42,829
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I did not see Doctor Horrible yet.

1276
01:31:43,549 --> 01:31:44,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I was too busy playing WoW.

1277
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:46,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to watch it.

1278
01:31:46,531 --> 01:31:47,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check it out.

1279
01:31:47,632 --> 01:31:53,336
[SPEAKER_08]: To go back to what I was talking about, about the TMNT fighter thing, I forgot when we mentioned this the first time.

1280
01:31:53,736 --> 01:32:02,422
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually being put together by some of the ex-Brawl team, which is probably why it's a little bit like Brawl, and Team Ninja.

1281
01:32:03,622 --> 01:32:04,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

1282
01:32:04,623 --> 01:32:08,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's by Team Ninja, does that mean we're going to get April O'Neil with ginormous tits?

1283
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:10,940
[SPEAKER_08]: 3 parts, Rob!

1284
01:32:28,496 --> 01:32:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: 3!

1285
01:32:28,997 --> 01:32:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll watch it eventually.

1286
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:33,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Mini Ninjas.

1287
01:32:33,659 --> 01:32:37,781
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a game that's being put out by IO Interactive.

1288
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:47,247
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember them of putting out such games as the Hitman franchise or I think they did maybe Kane and Lynch as well.

1289
01:32:48,767 --> 01:32:50,989
[SPEAKER_08]: This has actually been rated by the ESRB.

1290
01:32:51,069 --> 01:32:51,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It's E10+.

1291
01:32:51,969 --> 01:32:53,850
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a cute action game.

1292
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:56,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I also talked about it about a year ago from

1293
01:32:57,592 --> 01:32:58,733
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1294
01:33:25,103 --> 01:33:51,430
[SPEAKER_08]: well it's also better than um oh god what the hell is that crappy movie franchise not um three ninjas yeah it's better than three ninjas or pocket ninjas because that movie also sucked or little ninjas isn't that also a like a three ninjas type movie yes oh god i remember watching that it was so horrible like what was the like called like the guy like a

1295
01:33:53,314 --> 01:33:55,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make me go back to that place, Loki.

1296
01:33:56,816 --> 01:34:00,117
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that, the Dollar Tree video thing?

1297
01:34:02,298 --> 01:34:05,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Never buy a video for a dollar because you get what you pay for.

1298
01:34:05,779 --> 01:34:07,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's something you can buy relatively cheap.

1299
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Crystal Defenders.

1300
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:11,001
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a game put out by Squeenix.

1301
01:34:11,061 --> 01:34:12,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a mobile and iPod game.

1302
01:34:12,842 --> 01:34:14,742
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about defending towers, basically.

1303
01:34:15,323 --> 01:34:18,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going to be coming out for consoles, according to Fumitsu Magazine.

1304
01:34:18,224 --> 01:34:19,724
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to put it out on WiiWare.

1305
01:34:20,084 --> 01:34:21,185
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Crystal Defenders R1.

1306
01:34:22,325 --> 01:34:22,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Wifi Connection Support

1307
01:34:37,122 --> 01:34:37,623
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1308
01:35:02,011 --> 01:35:03,092
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Open Up The Mailbag

1309
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Just three.

1310
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:25,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

1311
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:28,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Orange Lounge Radio!

1312
01:35:28,203 --> 01:35:28,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

1313
01:35:29,624 --> 01:35:34,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a latecomer to this podcast and I found out while browsing various podcasts on the Zune Marketplace.

1314
01:35:35,428 --> 01:35:35,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

1315
01:35:36,749 --> 01:35:39,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, Zune Marketplace, for the plug.

1316
01:35:39,713 --> 01:35:42,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I've stumbled onto it as it's a very entertaining podcast.

1317
01:35:56,269 --> 01:36:02,633
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't worry too much about it being horror, even though my most cowardly horror movie-loathing friends enjoy Left 4 Dead.

1318
01:36:03,394 --> 01:36:09,878
[SPEAKER_02]: This is mainly because Left 4 Dead is less a survival horror game and first-person shooter as it is a party game.

1319
01:36:09,978 --> 01:36:14,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I explained it to one of my friends best when I said Left 4 Dead is pretty much Rock Band with the Undead.

1320
01:36:15,142 --> 01:36:16,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Listener, Ross.

1321
01:36:16,623 --> 01:36:16,983
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1322
01:36:17,383 --> 01:36:23,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to join your Steam community group, but are there only 19 people in it?

1323
01:36:23,547 --> 01:36:25,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's got to be more listeners than that.

1324
01:36:26,449 --> 01:36:28,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a little encouragement from the show?

1325
01:36:28,832 --> 01:36:29,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Join it!

1326
01:36:30,694 --> 01:36:32,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember where the Steam community is at.

1327
01:36:32,696 --> 01:36:33,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's going to sound horrible.

1328
01:36:33,657 --> 01:36:34,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know if I'm in it.

1329
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:36,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I am.

1330
01:36:36,941 --> 01:36:38,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to have to look it up.

1331
01:36:38,843 --> 01:36:40,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even know we had a Steam community.

1332
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:49,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I must admit, it must have come up like once in a show a long time ago, like when I first got Steam, and probably because I never used it, it lost Steam.

1333
01:36:51,225 --> 01:36:58,789
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will check it out, and I want to get Left 4 Dead, and another game I've been eyeing getting on Steam is Mirror's Edge, because I kind of want to check that out.

1334
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:02,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And for some reason I'm feeling like playing it on the PC as opposed to a console.

1335
01:37:03,131 --> 01:37:03,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see.

1336
01:37:05,137 --> 01:37:28,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I will check out Left 4 Dead though and yeah go find the Orange Lounge Radio Steam community and I'll plug it next week on the show and then I'll play it and then I can play with listeners because I don't know a lot of people that play PC games so I'm sure there's there you go we'll see next email dun dun dun which actually I got two emails from the same person and one is a continuation so let's just go for it okay

1337
01:37:28,905 --> 01:37:32,226
[SPEAKER_02]: To start with, my brother just won a PlayStation 3 at work.

1338
01:37:32,426 --> 01:37:36,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me reiterate, my brother won a frequent PlayStation 3 at work.

1339
01:37:37,148 --> 01:37:38,749
[SPEAKER_02]: An 80 gig model specifically.

1340
01:37:39,289 --> 01:37:46,332
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gotten GT5 Prologue, is getting GTA 4, and my getting LittleBigPlanet are givens.

1341
01:37:47,392 --> 01:37:47,572
[SPEAKER_02]: True dat.

1342
01:37:47,592 --> 01:37:48,212
[SPEAKER_02]: True dat.

1343
01:38:14,918 --> 01:38:20,161
[SPEAKER_02]: My Guitar Hero World Tour somehow got the cymbal wires cut slash torn.

1344
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:28,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably it's having a sensitivity issue, so I've gone ahead and replaced it with the Wii RB1 drum kit.

1345
01:38:28,386 --> 01:38:38,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon we'll see third-party drum kits for all the systems as common as third-party guitar controllers.

1346
01:38:39,913 --> 01:38:43,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, dude, you could actually solder the wires too and fix it.

1347
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:50,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I have Saints Row 2 and the ported form of Orange Box on my Gamefly list.

1348
01:38:51,178 --> 01:38:53,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to see what else to look into.

1349
01:38:53,239 --> 01:38:59,262
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother is a subscriber of Netflix and will be changing most of his rental list to Blu-ray versions of the movies.

1350
01:38:59,662 --> 01:39:02,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the PS3 Netflix streaming currently available?

1351
01:39:03,384 --> 01:39:04,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox 360.

1352
01:39:05,025 --> 01:39:06,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's only on Xbox 360.

1353
01:39:10,407 --> 01:39:11,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you can...

1354
01:39:12,885 --> 01:39:14,446
[SPEAKER_08]: using your PC.

1355
01:39:14,947 --> 01:39:16,088
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can watch movies on your PC.

1356
01:39:16,988 --> 01:39:27,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I know that, but I'm not sure if you can use the Netflix on PC as a media server and then stream it to your... No, I think it uses its own application, so I don't think you can do that.

1357
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:40,346
[SPEAKER_08]: They do have an application out there that will actually stream whatever is on your PC monitor, so using that, then yes, you could probably stream Netflix, but you'd have to find that first.

1358
01:39:42,378 --> 01:39:43,739
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

1359
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:46,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more emails?

1360
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:48,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even done, Rob.

1361
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:48,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry!

1362
01:39:49,361 --> 01:39:52,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't conclude this one, Rob.

1363
01:39:53,522 --> 01:40:02,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And just for the heck of asking, will the TV tuner units for the PSP and DS, although generally not readily available in the United States, become obsolete with the digital transition?

1364
01:40:03,659 --> 01:40:05,462
[SPEAKER_08]: What a good question.

1365
01:40:05,582 --> 01:40:09,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, obviously not in Japan, because they're not switching over there.

1366
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:11,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's only in the US.

1367
01:40:11,833 --> 01:40:12,093
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1368
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:16,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think yes, they're going to be obsolete.

1369
01:40:16,659 --> 01:40:22,900
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're using the same type of technology, if they're not receiving digital TV signals, which I doubt they are, then it's not going to work.

1370
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:28,282
[SPEAKER_08]: The TV tuners for the DS and stuff over there work with their network.

1371
01:40:28,342 --> 01:40:30,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the same as ours over here.

1372
01:40:31,163 --> 01:40:34,924
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't tune in our stations with that TV tuner, basically.

1373
01:40:35,924 --> 01:40:36,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1374
01:40:36,684 --> 01:40:38,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you wouldn't be able to use them anyways.

1375
01:40:39,045 --> 01:40:40,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it depends how it works.

1376
01:40:40,725 --> 01:40:43,966
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's basically hooking up rabbit ears to your DS, then it's not going to work.

1377
01:40:44,366 --> 01:40:49,227
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's somehow feeding... Because I thought it was a digital streaming service over there.

1378
01:40:49,747 --> 01:40:51,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it OneSeg or something like that?

1379
01:40:52,048 --> 01:40:52,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1380
01:40:52,528 --> 01:40:54,568
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know it's not compatible over here.

1381
01:40:54,749 --> 01:40:56,569
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they haven't brought it out over here because...

1382
01:40:57,912 --> 01:41:00,514
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't use it on our network.

1383
01:41:00,714 --> 01:41:06,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I don't think that many people would be interested in streaming or watching live TV.

1384
01:41:06,098 --> 01:41:07,359
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it could be useful.

1385
01:41:07,776 --> 01:41:12,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to conclude the email, by the way, it was from Robert M., by the way, just saying.

1386
01:41:14,017 --> 01:41:25,779
[SPEAKER_02]: The second portion that was sent says, As if my last email wasn't long enough, since I found them for $20, I went ahead and purchased the Orange Box, good choice, Burnout Paradise, as well as LittleBigPlanet.

1387
01:41:26,059 --> 01:41:28,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully my brother can invest in a second controller.

1388
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:30,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm replacing Orange Box with Fallout 3.

1389
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:32,401
[SPEAKER_07]: He found LittleBigPlanet for $20?

1390
01:41:32,441 --> 01:41:33,881
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a hell of a find.

1391
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:35,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say so.

1392
01:41:35,531 --> 01:41:35,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

1393
01:41:36,231 --> 01:41:38,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless he just means that he just purchased it.

1394
01:41:38,893 --> 01:41:44,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Box and Burnout Paradise would most likely be in the less expensive range.

1395
01:41:46,098 --> 01:41:46,458
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1396
01:41:47,039 --> 01:41:47,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are some good choices, though.

1397
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:48,540
[SPEAKER_07]: It's over!

1398
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,420
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it?

1399
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:50,021
[SPEAKER_07]: For emails?

1400
01:41:50,361 --> 01:41:50,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1401
01:41:50,761 --> 01:41:51,802
[SPEAKER_07]: What a weak selection.

1402
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:54,884
[SPEAKER_07]: No offense to the people that did email us, but we didn't get a lot of emails.

1403
01:41:55,284 --> 01:41:58,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.

1404
01:41:58,647 --> 01:41:58,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1405
01:41:59,895 --> 01:42:00,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Burnout Paradise

1406
01:42:18,991 --> 01:42:19,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1407
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:41,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1408
01:42:58,064 --> 01:43:02,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Browse while connected to the Criterion Games Network.

1409
01:43:03,207 --> 01:43:06,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll be able to see all the game updates and purchases and stuff like that.

1410
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:08,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Tweaked vehicle handling.

1411
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:13,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier cars are now tweaked to be easier for newcomers to use.

1412
01:43:13,732 --> 01:43:17,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And these cars are now slower, harder to crash, and less likely to spin out at low speeds.

1413
01:43:18,395 --> 01:43:19,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Junkyard sorting.

1414
01:43:19,515 --> 01:43:24,418
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be able to compare the stats of the cars and you'll be able to filter out cars and bikes.

1415
01:43:25,158 --> 01:43:27,299
[SPEAKER_08]: and upcoming download content vehicles.

1416
01:43:28,059 --> 01:43:29,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Stunt run timer change.

1417
01:43:30,279 --> 01:43:34,240
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a different timer now that starts much slower than before.

1418
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:37,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Allows beginners more wiggle room to start a combo.

1419
01:43:38,821 --> 01:43:40,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see here.

1420
01:43:40,582 --> 01:43:42,842
[SPEAKER_08]: They've rebalanced the events.

1421
01:43:43,222 --> 01:43:45,963
[SPEAKER_08]: All events have been modified to accommodate the new car speeds.

1422
01:43:46,643 --> 01:43:49,344
[SPEAKER_08]: They have road rage tweaked a bit.

1423
01:43:49,484 --> 01:43:53,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Players are no longer able to get additional time once they've reached the target score.

1424
01:43:56,791 --> 01:43:57,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

1425
01:43:57,972 --> 01:43:59,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Enhanced visuals.

1426
01:43:59,774 --> 01:44:05,177
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to be fixing some of the in-game billboards and smashes.

1427
01:44:05,898 --> 01:44:06,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff's easier to spot.

1428
01:44:06,879 --> 01:44:11,082
[SPEAKER_08]: The lighting's been tweaked to make it more vibrant and easier to drive at night.

1429
01:44:11,442 --> 01:44:19,327
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a new restart function, so if you fuck up during a race, you can restart it, which is nice, instead of having to just drive all the way back to the starting point.

1430
01:44:19,648 --> 01:44:21,249
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, easier barrel rolls.

1431
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:24,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Barrel rolls are now

1432
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:25,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Automatic.

1433
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:28,612
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lot of stuff.

1434
01:44:29,453 --> 01:44:29,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1435
01:44:30,313 --> 01:44:39,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, the upcoming premium download content, the party toy cars and legendary cars, I think, are all coming out on the 6th.

1436
01:44:41,262 --> 01:44:41,963
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be cool.

1437
01:44:42,003 --> 01:44:46,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And new trophies, of course, tying in with that download content.

1438
01:44:46,246 --> 01:44:46,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1439
01:44:48,127 --> 01:44:48,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1440
01:44:49,244 --> 01:45:10,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I love it, they have one that's Sound the Horn on the Silver Lake Super Jump in the Calvary Bootlegger Because that was the, you know, generally I know, I love how they have all their cute little new names for the vehicles I thought that was especially cute, how they get around the copyright there, or what have you

1441
01:45:12,197 --> 01:45:20,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of download content, some very, very highly anticipated download content, probably by our very own Loki, is The Lost and the Damned.

1442
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:28,483
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the official name for the new downloadable expansion for Grand Theft Auto IV that is coming out on the Xbox 360 and only the Xbox 360.

1443
01:45:28,883 --> 01:45:32,104
[SPEAKER_07]: The Lost and the Damned is coming out February 17th.

1444
01:45:32,224 --> 01:45:34,925
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, we finally have a release date, February 17th.

1445
01:45:35,385 --> 01:45:36,906
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as how much it's going to set you back...

1446
01:45:38,567 --> 01:45:39,508
[SPEAKER_07]: 1,600 Microsoft Points.

1447
01:45:39,568 --> 01:45:40,629
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 20 bucks.

1448
01:45:41,149 --> 01:45:49,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, though, it will be about 10 to 20 hours of new gameplay, new missions, new music, new weapons, and apparently membership to a biker gang.

1449
01:45:50,497 --> 01:45:54,200
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing apparently that's not in it, though, is the voice actor who originally did...

1450
01:45:55,121 --> 01:45:56,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Nico's voice in Grand Theft Auto 4.

1451
01:45:56,722 --> 01:45:58,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember reading a story about that as well this week.

1452
01:45:58,924 --> 01:46:02,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, it just costs too damn much money for him to come back.

1453
01:46:02,406 --> 01:46:08,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he was saying that he wanted more money, or should have asked for more money, and he's not coming back because of that.

1454
01:46:09,251 --> 01:46:15,054
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that kind of sucks, too, is that Lost and Damned download content is basically its own game.

1455
01:46:15,535 --> 01:46:23,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you download that, you don't get new weapons in, say, the normal Grand Theft Auto game and stuff, because they say it just doesn't make sense that Nico would have access to...

1456
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:25,081
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, grenade launcher or something like that.

1457
01:46:25,141 --> 01:46:25,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I say, fuck that.

1458
01:46:25,881 --> 01:46:27,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Who gives a shit about continuity?

1459
01:46:27,862 --> 01:46:29,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I want my damn tanks and stuff.

1460
01:46:30,284 --> 01:46:33,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but, yeah, I will have to download this because it looks pretty awesome.

1461
01:46:35,347 --> 01:46:37,829
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not something that's going to be fluid with the original game.

1462
01:46:37,869 --> 01:46:39,511
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like really a separate game.

1463
01:46:40,251 --> 01:46:46,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're going to have a portion that kind of crosses over with Nico, but it's very brief.

1464
01:46:46,897 --> 01:46:49,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, he's in it for just a second during a cutscene.

1465
01:46:49,879 --> 01:46:54,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're going to have to copy-paste his voice acting from before if the guy's not coming back or get a guy to impersonate him.

1466
01:46:56,185 --> 01:46:57,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, which is kind of lame.

1467
01:46:58,126 --> 01:47:00,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should just put out a pack later that's just...

1468
01:47:01,579 --> 01:47:04,160
[SPEAKER_08]: over the top stuff like bring back the flamethrower.

1469
01:47:04,441 --> 01:47:06,642
[SPEAKER_08]: They were going to have the flamethrower in this game and they cut it out.

1470
01:47:06,682 --> 01:47:07,382
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lame.

1471
01:47:08,082 --> 01:47:11,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring back the flamethrower, the minigun, the tanks.

1472
01:47:11,684 --> 01:47:13,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go crazy with it.

1473
01:47:13,305 --> 01:47:14,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Animal Crossing Village.

1474
01:47:15,126 --> 01:47:16,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And they should bring zombies in there.

1475
01:47:16,807 --> 01:47:21,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Have it where you defend Liberty City against a zombie attack or something.

1476
01:47:21,709 --> 01:47:26,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally rip off 28 Days Later or something like that.

1477
01:47:29,413 --> 01:47:29,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1478
01:47:30,053 --> 01:47:30,714
[SPEAKER_07]: We will see.

1479
01:47:32,076 --> 01:47:32,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Porn!

1480
01:47:32,236 --> 01:47:32,576
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Mega Man!

1481
01:47:51,647 --> 01:47:53,948
[SPEAKER_02]: StarForce3, Red Joker, Black Ace

1482
01:48:11,256 --> 01:48:12,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Which actually looks pretty cool.

1483
01:48:13,378 --> 01:48:16,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually haven't played any of the Star Force games before.

1484
01:48:16,841 --> 01:48:21,665
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's sort of an action RPG with what they call noise changes.

1485
01:48:22,205 --> 01:48:31,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually use a hundred different noises to combine that changes Mega Man's look in the game and also changes his abilities.

1486
01:48:31,973 --> 01:48:34,775
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off of Earth, Wind, Air, and Fire.

1487
01:48:35,596 --> 01:48:37,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Fire being the greatest of all time, of course.

1488
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:41,939
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can trade noises with other Nintendo Wi-Fi players.

1489
01:48:41,959 --> 01:48:43,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's supposed to be out in the summer.

1490
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:44,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks sweet!

1491
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1492
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:47,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1493
01:48:48,221 --> 01:48:49,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I want more side-scrolling Mega Man.

1494
01:48:49,622 --> 01:48:50,322
[SPEAKER_07]: At least we got Mega Man 9.

1495
01:48:51,682 --> 01:48:52,403
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hard to complain.

1496
01:48:52,783 --> 01:48:55,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't that be ported to DS is what I want to know.

1497
01:48:55,123 --> 01:48:56,324
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1498
01:48:56,344 --> 01:48:57,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make Mega Man 10.

1499
01:48:58,424 --> 01:49:00,425
[SPEAKER_07]: But make it easier for dum-dums like me.

1500
01:49:00,565 --> 01:49:01,345
[SPEAKER_07]: No, keep it hard.

1501
01:49:02,066 --> 01:49:03,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives you a sense of accomplishment.

1502
01:49:04,466 --> 01:49:05,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1503
01:49:06,167 --> 01:49:06,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

1504
01:49:07,789 --> 01:49:10,991
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a game that's coming out, or I should say it's not coming out.

1505
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:14,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a mature game by the name of Winter.

1506
01:49:14,794 --> 01:49:20,337
[SPEAKER_08]: It was being put out by the team, Endspace.

1507
01:49:20,858 --> 01:49:25,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, they were behind the GameCube game Geist, which was kind of...

1508
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:27,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that successful.

1509
01:49:28,151 --> 01:49:33,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently they ran into a problem though with their sales and marketing groups.

1510
01:49:33,355 --> 01:49:39,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the game, they could not get behind a Survivor horror title on the Wii.

1511
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:51,968
[SPEAKER_08]: And in spite of great sales like on the Resident Evil 4 and Umbrella Chronicles and stuff that's similar to this, they didn't get the green light to basically make this game.

1512
01:49:52,389 --> 01:49:52,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is lame.

1513
01:49:53,569 --> 01:49:54,610
[SPEAKER_08]: But the game itself...

1514
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:56,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1515
01:50:13,587 --> 01:50:15,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you know, on the Wii.

1516
01:50:15,869 --> 01:50:16,649
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks.

1517
01:50:16,909 --> 01:50:20,672
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a somewhat serious looking survival horror game and they don't want to do it.

1518
01:50:21,252 --> 01:50:22,693
[SPEAKER_07]: But yet they'll remake Resident Evil 4.

1519
01:50:22,994 --> 01:50:23,334
[SPEAKER_07]: It's silly.

1520
01:50:23,394 --> 01:50:27,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, with so much of a ripoff of Silent Hill, it's not even funny.

1521
01:50:27,537 --> 01:50:32,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It was... You could have called it Silent Hill and people would have been like, Oh my god, Silent Hill!

1522
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:34,201
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that close.

1523
01:50:36,648 --> 01:50:37,849
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Silent Snow?

1524
01:50:38,769 --> 01:50:41,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this game just going to slip into obscurity forever?

1525
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:43,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think it's possible this game could show up?

1526
01:50:43,751 --> 01:50:44,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It could come back.

1527
01:50:44,711 --> 01:50:45,232
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

1528
01:50:45,252 --> 01:50:48,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're going to have, was it the Lost Mountain or something like that?

1529
01:50:48,773 --> 01:50:53,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I think is one of the survival horror games coming out in the Wii.

1530
01:50:53,755 --> 01:50:54,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's some other ones.

1531
01:50:55,136 --> 01:50:57,697
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Sadness, whenever the hell that actually comes out.

1532
01:50:57,717 --> 01:50:59,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Sadness end up getting canceled or something?

1533
01:50:59,357 --> 01:51:03,219
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think it's still being worked on.

1534
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:06,060
[SPEAKER_07]: That game looked pretty amazing and then just kind of disappeared.

1535
01:51:06,912 --> 01:51:08,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1536
01:51:10,193 --> 01:51:15,774
[SPEAKER_08]: It may come back later if they start doing more games that are like adult on the Wii and they end up being successful.

1537
01:51:15,934 --> 01:51:19,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they can say, hey, you know, maybe we should put out this game.

1538
01:51:19,815 --> 01:51:24,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you look at some of the games like, for example, Two Human.

1539
01:51:24,556 --> 01:51:27,497
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that thing was in development since like the Nintendo 64.

1540
01:51:27,597 --> 01:51:29,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Cameo.

1541
01:51:29,917 --> 01:51:31,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those weren't exactly great games.

1542
01:51:31,777 --> 01:51:33,418
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, I mean, it could...

1543
01:51:34,298 --> 01:51:34,478
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1544
01:51:45,555 --> 01:51:46,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Dawn of War 2 Warhammer 40,000 Steam

1545
01:52:09,225 --> 01:52:11,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And then suddenly it just disappeared.

1546
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:23,922
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop.com is no longer offering the game.

1547
01:52:24,462 --> 01:52:30,306
[SPEAKER_07]: If you call a GameStop store, they will tell you that Dawn of War 2, you can't pre-order this game.

1548
01:52:30,746 --> 01:52:37,210
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently, previously, you were able to get a Chapter Command War Gear set if you pre-ordered the game through GameStop.

1549
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:38,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So what the hell's going on?

1550
01:52:39,811 --> 01:52:40,972
[SPEAKER_07]: The game didn't get cancelled.

1551
01:52:41,032 --> 01:52:43,153
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they just mentioned that the game went gold.

1552
01:52:43,893 --> 01:52:47,976
[SPEAKER_07]: THQ is behind the game, and they actually bumped up the release date.

1553
01:52:49,255 --> 01:52:52,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently though, something's going on with Steam.

1554
01:52:53,056 --> 01:52:58,718
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is requiring you to install Steam, and of course Steam being the way that you can get games online.

1555
01:52:59,078 --> 01:53:01,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently GameStop Corporate not happy with this.

1556
01:53:02,459 --> 01:53:05,700
[SPEAKER_07]: But the weird thing is, don't Valve games make you install Steam too?

1557
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it's Valve's program.

1558
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:09,862
[SPEAKER_07]: But yet they carry those games.

1559
01:53:09,942 --> 01:53:12,383
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop will carry Orange Box and those type of games.

1560
01:53:13,363 --> 01:53:13,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1561
01:53:13,603 --> 01:53:13,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1562
01:53:16,028 --> 01:53:19,410
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop is kind of pissed.

1563
01:53:20,251 --> 01:53:30,660
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of this is kind of rumor, but it would make sense because GameStop does not like it when digital distribution occurs before the game is released to retail.

1564
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:33,983
[SPEAKER_07]: This kind of goes back to when Penny Arcade Adventures came out.

1565
01:53:34,143 --> 01:53:36,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to ask, why do they even care?

1566
01:53:36,785 --> 01:53:39,187
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't really give a shit about PC titles.

1567
01:53:39,547 --> 01:53:41,749
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've seen their PC selection, it's like a shelf.

1568
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:43,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, who gives a crap?

1569
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:46,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, maybe it's the principle of the thing.

1570
01:53:46,532 --> 01:53:52,755
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, oh, you're really cutting into our PC sales, which are very small anyways.

1571
01:53:53,115 --> 01:53:53,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

1572
01:53:54,576 --> 01:54:08,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, take this news with a little bit of caution, because it's not necessarily... It could be some very strange misunderstanding, but a lot of people are reading into that the game is just not available.

1573
01:54:11,381 --> 01:54:38,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why they wouldn't carry game because I mean that's potential for people to trade in other things that they make a high margin off of you know to buy said game I mean hell they're doing it now I mean it's so ridiculous they're doing it now with download content cards oh I'm going to trade in some games to get a card to go download something off of Xbox Live Arcade I mean like or you know the Lost and Damned or the new Tomb Raider levels and stuff like that it's like

1574
01:54:39,693 --> 01:54:39,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1575
01:54:40,454 --> 01:54:42,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you just buy a card?

1576
01:54:42,477 --> 01:54:43,178
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a points card.

1577
01:54:43,258 --> 01:54:44,199
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing.

1578
01:54:46,202 --> 01:54:46,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1579
01:54:47,363 --> 01:54:48,084
[SPEAKER_08]: It's retarded.

1580
01:54:49,892 --> 01:54:52,113
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1581
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:13,161
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1582
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:38,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we will see an official corporate response from one of the two in the next week, so you can probably bet we'll hear something about this next week.

1583
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how about some different type of news?

1584
01:56:02,298 --> 01:56:03,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1585
01:56:21,380 --> 01:56:22,241
[SPEAKER_07]: You're so mature.

1586
01:56:22,401 --> 01:56:22,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1587
01:56:24,062 --> 01:56:24,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1588
01:56:25,163 --> 01:56:27,225
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working on a 2D RPG.

1589
01:56:27,906 --> 01:56:28,146
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1590
01:56:28,726 --> 01:56:39,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's working on a 2D RPG, but it's... I really don't know what else to say about it.

1591
01:56:39,235 --> 01:56:45,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it looks like a 2D platformer type of RPG-ish sort of thing.

1592
01:56:47,182 --> 01:56:48,323
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said that he...

1593
01:56:50,342 --> 01:56:57,425
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to say that they're trying to do something specific with the actual way the game plays.

1594
01:56:57,986 --> 01:57:02,268
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really not too many details on it, and I squeezed the fear out by accident.

1595
01:57:04,929 --> 01:57:09,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually doesn't really have that much attention that he's paying to it.

1596
01:57:09,031 --> 01:57:11,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like going, okay, I'm going to work on the RPG.

1597
01:57:12,012 --> 01:57:12,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, shiny!

1598
01:57:14,774 --> 01:57:18,916
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, he'll do whatever he damn well pleases, but this is what's capturing his attention right now.

1599
01:57:19,256 --> 01:57:19,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1600
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:20,540
[SPEAKER_07]: RPG.

1601
01:57:22,841 --> 01:57:24,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay.

1602
01:57:24,142 --> 01:57:31,786
[SPEAKER_08]: At least he's not developing it for the DS and he's not going to lock himself into a room because he can't get a dev tip.

1603
01:57:31,826 --> 01:57:34,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that guy apparently finally let himself out of the room.

1604
01:57:34,607 --> 01:57:35,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Trashed his room.

1605
01:57:36,408 --> 01:57:37,108
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy had issues.

1606
01:57:37,488 --> 01:57:38,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's throw a fit now.

1607
01:57:38,569 --> 01:57:41,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember that guy's name, and even if I did, I wouldn't want to say it.

1608
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:44,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally forgot about the guy, except I sort of remember us talking about it.

1609
01:57:44,991 --> 01:57:48,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, remember the guy, he locked himself in a room and was throwing a fit because Nintendo wouldn't send him a dev kit or whatever?

1610
01:57:49,213 --> 01:57:50,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the retard.

1611
01:57:50,253 --> 01:57:54,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, he finally quit his little tantrum and trashed his entire room on his way out.

1612
01:57:55,795 --> 01:57:56,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

1613
01:57:56,655 --> 01:57:58,256
[SPEAKER_07]: But yet, here we are talking about him.

1614
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,461
[SPEAKER_07]: and lots of people did.

1615
01:58:01,021 --> 01:58:04,524
[SPEAKER_08]: This game looked lame anyways.

1616
01:58:04,765 --> 01:58:05,946
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, I need a dev cam.

1617
01:58:05,966 --> 01:58:07,227
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, no, I don't want to play that game.

1618
01:58:07,327 --> 01:58:08,388
[SPEAKER_08]: That game looks stupid.

1619
01:58:08,668 --> 01:58:10,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care if you waste it.

1620
01:58:10,610 --> 01:58:13,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, it looked like something you'd make with RPG Maker.

1621
01:58:14,994 --> 01:58:16,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the old RPG Maker.

1622
01:58:17,656 --> 01:58:18,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Not anything good.

1623
01:58:19,678 --> 01:58:20,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1624
01:58:21,299 --> 01:58:21,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1625
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:22,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe put ZZT.

1626
01:58:24,815 --> 01:58:25,316
[SPEAKER_08]: on the DS.

1627
01:58:25,476 --> 01:58:25,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.

1628
01:58:26,577 --> 01:58:27,558
[SPEAKER_08]: ZZT on the DS.

1629
01:58:27,678 --> 01:58:28,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they do.

1630
01:58:28,339 --> 01:58:28,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I say yes.

1631
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:29,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, more news.

1632
01:58:30,475 --> 01:58:38,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well, in the tradition of download content for EA games, Skate 2 has now put out some download... Well, I wouldn't even call it download content.

1633
01:58:38,896 --> 01:58:40,757
[SPEAKER_08]: You download a key to unlock crap.

1634
01:58:41,317 --> 01:58:45,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, it's a... Time is money pack.

1635
01:58:45,938 --> 01:58:55,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It costs you 400 Microsoft points, and it will unlock all locations, skaters, and gear that can be earned by playing through Skate 2's career and online modes.

1636
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,320
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically...

1637
01:58:59,349 --> 01:59:03,072
[SPEAKER_08]: For people that don't want to play the game, they'll just unlock everything right there for you.

1638
01:59:04,753 --> 01:59:07,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Which begs the question, why even buy the game if you don't want to play through it?

1639
01:59:08,176 --> 01:59:09,777
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pay-to-unlock content.

1640
01:59:10,057 --> 01:59:10,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1641
01:59:10,357 --> 01:59:11,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I always hate in video games.

1642
01:59:12,799 --> 01:59:13,099
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stupid.

1643
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:15,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Pay-to-unlock cheat codes, that's basically it.

1644
01:59:15,701 --> 01:59:16,642
[SPEAKER_07]: They've done this before.

1645
01:59:17,363 --> 01:59:18,323
[SPEAKER_08]: With other games, right?

1646
01:59:18,423 --> 01:59:23,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, Tiger Woods, other EA games.

1647
01:59:24,736 --> 01:59:27,999
[SPEAKER_07]: News about pay-to-unlock content makes me angry.

1648
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:30,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And here, yeah, Aesthetic Vampire says it perfect in chat.

1649
01:59:30,921 --> 01:59:33,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.orange.com, he says it's for lazy asses.

1650
01:59:34,283 --> 01:59:36,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, it is for lazy asses.

1651
01:59:36,645 --> 01:59:44,291
[SPEAKER_07]: So to anyone that's actually going to support this kind of content and encourage them to put out this content in the future, I'd like to dedicate a little piece of angst to you.

1652
01:59:59,264 --> 02:00:01,050
[SPEAKER_07]: FUs of the week time, DarkSakura

1653
02:00:01,943 --> 02:00:11,069
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest FUs go to incessant bitching without the will to do anything about it.

1654
02:00:11,229 --> 02:00:15,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying that that's what anybody in this room was doing.

1655
02:00:16,112 --> 02:00:28,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I am saying that I have been hearing nothing but people bitching all week about stupid shit that they could just say something and it would be fixed.

1656
02:00:30,017 --> 02:00:31,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1657
02:00:52,216 --> 02:00:56,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been accused of being bitchy about it.

1658
02:00:56,959 --> 02:00:57,600
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

1659
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:03,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I really have... You know how much sympathy I have for the incessant complaining without doing shit about it?

1660
02:01:04,665 --> 02:01:05,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.

1661
02:01:06,806 --> 02:01:08,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother Teresa, you ain't.

1662
02:01:08,527 --> 02:01:09,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mother Teresa was a bitch.

1663
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:15,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Only on this program.

1664
02:01:16,281 --> 02:01:16,501
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1665
02:01:17,242 --> 02:01:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother Teresa liked to make people suffer because it made them closer to God.

1666
02:01:24,888 --> 02:01:25,588
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true.

1667
02:01:26,689 --> 02:01:31,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why all of her little hospitals were nothing better than hubbles.

1668
02:01:31,773 --> 02:01:35,256
[SPEAKER_02]: She wouldn't deliver medicine and would do nothing to ease the pain.

1669
02:01:35,316 --> 02:01:38,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't mean to open a can of worms during the FU.

1670
02:01:38,099 --> 02:01:39,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother Teresa was a bitch.

1671
02:01:40,945 --> 02:01:42,988
[SPEAKER_08]: What if you were suffering from starvation?

1672
02:01:43,048 --> 02:01:45,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't that make you closer to God because you're dying?

1673
02:01:46,293 --> 02:01:47,615
[SPEAKER_02]: In her opinion, yes.

1674
02:01:48,775 --> 02:01:49,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Gandhi was a racist.

1675
02:01:50,576 --> 02:01:51,097
[SPEAKER_02]: But, anyway.

1676
02:01:51,137 --> 02:01:52,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Less controversy, more angst.

1677
02:01:52,818 --> 02:01:53,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's true.

1678
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:07,307
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, it's just, you know, like, for example, I have a friend who says she's going to listen to the show and never does.

1679
02:02:08,148 --> 02:02:09,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know who she is.

1680
02:02:09,709 --> 02:02:11,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say on the air.

1681
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:17,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Who, at work, does nothing but complain about work.

1682
02:02:19,407 --> 02:02:21,250
[SPEAKER_02]: about the same thing over and over again.

1683
02:02:21,610 --> 02:02:25,996
[SPEAKER_02]: She complains about her family the same thing over and over and over again.

1684
02:02:26,356 --> 02:02:28,279
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same crap that she does too.

1685
02:02:28,399 --> 02:02:33,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, well, you know, all you have to do is this and you can fix it.

1686
02:02:35,849 --> 02:02:37,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing over and over and over and over again.

1687
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:39,712
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1688
02:02:51,826 --> 02:02:57,027
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nothing, you know, and also, and also, this goes in with it as well.

1689
02:02:58,107 --> 02:03:03,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't like for people to look for a crutch, you know what I mean?

1690
02:03:04,389 --> 02:03:12,311
[SPEAKER_02]: To put all of their hopes in one place and expect that that is going to be the end all, oh my god!

1691
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:30,678
[SPEAKER_02]: and I would like to right now offer an apology to our president the very awesome and we have a handsome president too but I would like to apologize to President Obama on behalf of all the fucking morons who thinks he can fix all the shit that's wrong in the government

1692
02:03:31,585 --> 02:03:32,726
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1693
02:03:56,576 --> 02:03:57,357
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1694
02:04:17,873 --> 02:04:19,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought 10 cans of cat food, by the way.

1695
02:04:36,846 --> 02:04:45,830
[SPEAKER_02]: to help these people who were fostering homeless cats at their own house in a no-kill shelter because they were trying to do some good in the world.

1696
02:04:46,651 --> 02:04:49,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I believed in what they were doing, I contributed.

1697
02:04:49,512 --> 02:04:51,753
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's cat food as an example.

1698
02:04:52,493 --> 02:04:56,535
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just saying, you know, if you want something bad enough, make it happen.

1699
02:04:57,256 --> 02:04:59,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a bummer, though, the economy didn't magically change overnight.

1700
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:03,370
[SPEAKER_02]: did really who expected it to?

1701
02:05:03,431 --> 02:05:10,236
[SPEAKER_07]: if anyone expected it to, they're fucking stupid I know, hopefully soon alright, any more?

1702
02:05:11,016 --> 02:05:28,990
[SPEAKER_08]: we gotta move on no, I'm sorry for ranting that's alright, Loki a few Rockstar games for making a crappy PC port of Grand Theft Auto 4 just reiterate that until I fix it and a few to the Spring TV lineup for having too many damn shows on that I need to watch that happen to be on at the same time I can't do that

1703
02:05:29,329 --> 02:05:32,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can't keep putting out cool shows, because then I get distracted.

1704
02:05:33,370 --> 02:05:33,950
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not good.

1705
02:05:34,351 --> 02:05:44,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't watch American Idol, Lie to Me, Nip Tuck, House, possibly Heroes, although it's supposed to suck this season, but I still gotta see how bad it's gonna suck.

1706
02:05:46,414 --> 02:05:51,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Fringe, and some stupid dance competition show.

1707
02:05:52,156 --> 02:05:53,076
[SPEAKER_06]: So you think you can dance?

1708
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:56,217
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's that International Dance Stars or something like that.

1709
02:05:56,237 --> 02:05:57,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the Grooves on it, so I wanted to watch it.

1710
02:05:57,818 --> 02:05:59,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1711
02:06:01,145 --> 02:06:01,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

1712
02:06:01,825 --> 02:06:02,245
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1713
02:06:02,385 --> 02:06:02,765
[SPEAKER_07]: My F.U.

1714
02:06:02,805 --> 02:06:04,486
[SPEAKER_07]: goes to the headache I have setting in.

1715
02:06:04,586 --> 02:06:05,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Boo hoo.

1716
02:06:05,066 --> 02:06:06,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to go run in the house and take some ibuprofen.

1717
02:06:07,046 --> 02:06:09,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I don't have a lot of F.U.s.

1718
02:06:10,107 --> 02:06:13,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in just like a mood.

1719
02:06:13,688 --> 02:06:13,828
[SPEAKER_07]: F.U.

1720
02:06:13,848 --> 02:06:14,688
[SPEAKER_07]: to being blow.

1721
02:06:15,948 --> 02:06:16,849
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I feel like.

1722
02:06:16,909 --> 02:06:17,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel a blow.

1723
02:06:17,809 --> 02:06:20,969
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1724
02:06:20,989 --> 02:06:22,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week.

1725
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:25,150
[SPEAKER_07]: More angst next week.

1726
02:06:26,311 --> 02:06:26,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Blow.

1727
02:06:27,291 --> 02:06:27,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Blow.

1728
02:06:29,645 --> 02:06:30,125
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

1729
02:06:56,912 --> 02:06:57,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to get on that tangent.

1730
02:06:58,834 --> 02:07:00,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I will talk instead about this.

1731
02:07:00,515 --> 02:07:09,523
[SPEAKER_07]: We were mentioning, or the chat room, I should say, was mentioning, when DarkSakura was talking about Obama, somebody had made the comment about he's the first president that did his addresses on YouTube.

1732
02:07:09,803 --> 02:07:11,425
[SPEAKER_07]: TigerClaw said that in the chat room.

1733
02:07:11,705 --> 02:07:14,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Obama is the first president to post YouTube videos of his addresses.

1734
02:07:14,567 --> 02:07:16,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So very interesting how YouTube has come a long way.

1735
02:07:16,629 --> 02:07:18,991
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also on the Xbox Marketplace, too.

1736
02:07:19,412 --> 02:07:20,493
[SPEAKER_08]: All the different...

1737
02:07:21,013 --> 02:07:24,335
[SPEAKER_08]: All the inauguration stuff.

1738
02:07:24,535 --> 02:07:25,096
[SPEAKER_07]: MSNBC.

1739
02:07:26,497 --> 02:07:30,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, this is something I was watching on CNN.

1740
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:31,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's cool.

1741
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:34,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this coming out of the White House, too.

1742
02:07:35,683 --> 02:07:42,107
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that he wanted to be much more transparent and available for the public.

1743
02:07:42,507 --> 02:07:44,549
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the president is a public servant.

1744
02:07:44,629 --> 02:07:45,309
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true, right?

1745
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:48,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to be seeing a whole lot more.

1746
02:07:48,551 --> 02:07:50,573
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a Spider-Man comic with Obama in it, too.

1747
02:07:52,074 --> 02:07:54,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But then didn't he not let cameras in when he retook the oath?

1748
02:07:56,718 --> 02:08:00,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that was him Just in case he fucked up again No, he didn't fuck up

1749
02:08:00,876 --> 02:08:04,498
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy repeating it... I know what I... He said it right.

1750
02:08:04,938 --> 02:08:07,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude repeating it to him fucked up.

1751
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:09,041
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just one of those awkward... Fired!

1752
02:08:09,341 --> 02:08:10,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to get too political.

1753
02:08:10,902 --> 02:08:13,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought he just smiled and was like, did you screw up?

1754
02:08:13,423 --> 02:08:24,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to get too political, but the whole fact that they had to do it a second time was ridiculous anyway, because there's an amendment in the Constitution that says Obama was president, whether he said, I like cupcakes up there on the stand or not.

1755
02:08:24,230 --> 02:08:26,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I do approve of that message.

1756
02:08:26,871 --> 02:08:28,412
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be the new inauguration.

1757
02:08:28,552 --> 02:08:29,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I like cupcakes.

1758
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:38,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying my point was look for more of this.

1759
02:08:38,302 --> 02:08:47,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this massive internet interaction with our government coming up.

1760
02:08:47,425 --> 02:08:48,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's pretty cool.

1761
02:08:48,365 --> 02:08:54,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, speaking of massive interaction, there's a whole version of Street Fighter that you can play on YouTube.

1762
02:08:54,869 --> 02:08:56,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's some type of tie-in.

1763
02:08:56,770 --> 02:08:57,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, on YouTube.

1764
02:08:57,811 --> 02:09:01,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's some type of tie-in with Soda Toys or whatever because they keep featuring this.

1765
02:09:01,874 --> 02:09:03,795
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's interesting, and I'll play it here in the background here.

1766
02:09:04,155 --> 02:09:05,536
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like this whole little Street Fighter thing.

1767
02:09:05,936 --> 02:09:10,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you play it, you can click on a button while it's flashing to make a move.

1768
02:09:10,919 --> 02:09:13,461
[SPEAKER_07]: It uses like the branching YouTube technology or whatever.

1769
02:09:13,801 --> 02:09:15,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I can select my fighter.

1770
02:09:15,202 --> 02:09:17,444
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's pick Zangief because he's the gay one.

1771
02:09:18,104 --> 02:09:18,824
[SPEAKER_07]: So I clicked on him.

1772
02:09:18,844 --> 02:09:22,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And it took me to Zangief versus Guile.

1773
02:09:22,626 --> 02:09:24,367
[SPEAKER_07]: And now all the buttons are flashing, I can do stuff!

1774
02:09:24,767 --> 02:09:32,911
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, I clicked Y. And it took me to another video where I got punched in the face by Guile, but I'll click A now and try to hit him again.

1775
02:09:33,691 --> 02:09:34,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get to hit him in another video.

1776
02:09:34,851 --> 02:09:36,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Where I got kicked in the face again!

1777
02:09:37,012 --> 02:09:37,933
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not very good at YouTube.

1778
02:09:37,953 --> 02:09:39,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you have to hit it when it flashes.

1779
02:09:39,914 --> 02:09:40,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I hit it when it flashed.

1780
02:09:41,054 --> 02:09:41,975
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you stopped.

1781
02:09:41,995 --> 02:09:42,195
[SPEAKER_07]: See?

1782
02:09:43,235 --> 02:09:43,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1783
02:09:43,495 --> 02:09:44,616
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to hit it right when it flashes.

1784
02:09:44,656 --> 02:09:44,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Go.

1785
02:09:48,226 --> 02:09:49,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, I'm Guile.

1786
02:09:49,067 --> 02:09:50,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm playing against Sangief, huh?

1787
02:09:50,627 --> 02:09:51,528
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess that's a good thing.

1788
02:09:53,669 --> 02:09:54,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo.

1789
02:09:54,970 --> 02:09:57,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so it's like this whole little interactive Street Fighter game.

1790
02:09:57,551 --> 02:10:02,354
[SPEAKER_07]: The user's name, if you want to see this, Patrick B-O-I-V-I-N.

1791
02:10:02,754 --> 02:10:05,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, there's no real easy way to link a YouTube.

1792
02:10:07,917 --> 02:10:08,398
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's it.

1793
02:10:09,298 --> 02:10:11,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Interactive Street Fighter on YouTube.

1794
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of interesting.

1795
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,482
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's something, though, that I actually am curious about.

1796
02:10:15,522 --> 02:10:17,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play Mugen?

1797
02:10:18,919 --> 02:10:20,961
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the fighting creature on Fighter, right?

1798
02:10:20,981 --> 02:10:29,147
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a long time ago when the chat was talking about there should be an all games interactive versus Orange Lounge Radio like fighting game and they were going to do it in Mugen except nothing ever happened.

1799
02:10:30,008 --> 02:10:38,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I actually, I've kind of got an idea for doing an Orange Lounge inspired Mugen.

1800
02:10:39,055 --> 02:10:40,316
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be more to come from this.

1801
02:10:40,516 --> 02:10:48,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to speak to people who are familiar with doing custom characters for Mugen and sprite editors.

1802
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:50,699
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1803
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:54,082
[SPEAKER_02]: But how about some different stuff?

1804
02:10:54,282 --> 02:10:56,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason's yelling at me in chat saying, what the fuck?

1805
02:10:56,163 --> 02:10:57,504
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no easy way to link to YouTube.

1806
02:10:57,584 --> 02:10:58,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Link the first video.

1807
02:10:59,045 --> 02:11:01,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I can do that for you guys in chat, but remember, it's a radio show.

1808
02:11:01,987 --> 02:11:08,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't exactly sit here and go, okay, go to YouTube.com, uppercase L, uppercase P, you know.

1809
02:11:11,194 --> 02:11:13,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't exactly read that little garbage code there.

1810
02:11:14,096 --> 02:11:14,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, sorry.

1811
02:11:15,777 --> 02:11:17,098
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what tiny URL is for.

1812
02:11:17,546 --> 02:11:17,926
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

1813
02:11:18,087 --> 02:11:19,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Even tiny URLs kind of pokey.

1814
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1815
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:23,271
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what one of my favorite games was though, Rob?

1816
02:11:23,311 --> 02:11:23,652
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?

1817
02:11:23,672 --> 02:11:24,713
[SPEAKER_02]: When it came out a few years ago.

1818
02:11:24,773 --> 02:11:25,093
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

1819
02:11:25,393 --> 02:11:26,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Hydro Thunder!

1820
02:11:27,215 --> 02:11:29,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that game is still at a lot of arcades.

1821
02:11:29,297 --> 02:11:32,300
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like one of the only actual arcade games you see in arcades.

1822
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:34,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I freaking love that game.

1823
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:38,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played the crap out of it on Dreamcast.

1824
02:11:38,102 --> 02:11:38,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.

1825
02:11:39,323 --> 02:11:40,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

1826
02:11:40,764 --> 02:11:47,086
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a spiritual successor to Hydro Thunder called H2 Overdrive.

1827
02:11:49,007 --> 02:11:49,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1828
02:11:49,688 --> 02:11:56,231
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm looking at pictures and it looks like totally like how Hydro Thunder looks.

1829
02:11:56,251 --> 02:11:57,472
[SPEAKER_08]: It basically is Hydro Thunder.

1830
02:11:57,492 --> 02:11:59,293
[SPEAKER_08]: They remade some of the levels from the original game.

1831
02:11:59,313 --> 02:12:00,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So why didn't they just call it Hydro Thunder 2?

1832
02:12:00,994 --> 02:12:03,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Because someone owns a trademark for that.

1833
02:12:04,115 --> 02:12:04,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, lame.

1834
02:12:05,236 --> 02:12:08,838
[SPEAKER_02]: This is supposed to be out, I think, by Raw Thrills.

1835
02:12:09,598 --> 02:12:16,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually should be seeing it at the ATEI Expo in London to, you know,

1836
02:12:17,422 --> 02:12:21,883
[SPEAKER_02]: If any of our listeners in London are going to be there, do take pictures, please.

1837
02:12:23,684 --> 02:12:25,124
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's official.

1838
02:12:25,164 --> 02:12:29,445
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, 1UP has a preview of it with the video and everything.

1839
02:12:29,725 --> 02:12:31,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So, check it out.

1840
02:12:31,626 --> 02:12:32,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming to an arcade near you, maybe?

1841
02:12:33,466 --> 02:12:34,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I will sew there.

1842
02:12:35,187 --> 02:12:35,527
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1843
02:12:35,687 --> 02:12:36,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds awesome.

1844
02:12:36,887 --> 02:12:38,868
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be in the corner of all the Pete's Places now.

1845
02:12:42,498 --> 02:12:50,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was some games talked about during Ubisoft's financial earnings conference call.

1846
02:12:53,652 --> 02:12:54,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Assassin's Creed 2 A new Ghost Recon game

1847
02:13:17,725 --> 02:13:20,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, Beyond Good and Evil 2, because that's already been announced.

1848
02:13:21,749 --> 02:13:30,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, they let another title slip that they weren't supposed to talk about, but Red Steel 2 is going to be coming out at some point.

1849
02:13:32,839 --> 02:13:33,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Now with Wii Motion Plus.

1850
02:13:35,761 --> 02:13:37,002
[SPEAKER_07]: How did that slip in there?

1851
02:13:37,283 --> 02:13:38,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, by the way, Red Steel 2.

1852
02:13:39,164 --> 02:13:42,107
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he's like... I forget what it was.

1853
02:13:42,227 --> 02:13:42,467
[SPEAKER_08]: It was...

1854
02:13:44,911 --> 02:13:48,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We have lots of products coming for the Wii next fiscal year.

1855
02:13:49,415 --> 02:13:53,938
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Red Steel... Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that.

1856
02:13:54,098 --> 02:13:56,480
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 in chat calls it Red Shit Teal 2.

1857
02:13:57,821 --> 02:13:59,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Red Steel was very disappointing.

1858
02:13:59,482 --> 02:14:01,344
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't a surprise, though.

1859
02:14:01,364 --> 02:14:03,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard them talk about Red Steel 2 before.

1860
02:14:03,605 --> 02:14:05,447
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to fix a lot of stuff if they're going to do that.

1861
02:14:05,887 --> 02:14:06,928
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what, though?

1862
02:14:06,988 --> 02:14:08,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Conduit looks awesome.

1863
02:14:08,889 --> 02:14:10,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1864
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:10,851
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1865
02:14:11,491 --> 02:14:12,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they can do it.

1866
02:14:13,758 --> 02:14:23,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, when I was telling you my Warcraft story earlier about how I, you know, left and everything, I assured you I did not do it to go back to Final Fantasy XI.

1867
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:27,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And after some news this week, Lord knows if I could, I might have been banned.

1868
02:14:28,361 --> 02:14:31,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Because apparently tons of the hardcore players were banned from Final Fantasy XI this week.

1869
02:14:32,802 --> 02:14:39,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, just joking, obviously I would not have exploited a cheat in the game as these people did that got banned.

1870
02:14:39,504 --> 02:14:41,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1871
02:14:56,967 --> 02:15:02,052
[SPEAKER_07]: and Squeenix finally did some emergency maintenance on November 26th.

1872
02:15:02,092 --> 02:15:02,993
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a while ago.

1873
02:15:03,453 --> 02:15:07,897
[SPEAKER_07]: They went back, I guess, for all those logs and all that stuff and figured out who did this.

1874
02:15:08,358 --> 02:15:14,524
[SPEAKER_07]: They temporarily suspended 400 players and 550 players who committed serious misconduct.

1875
02:15:14,964 --> 02:15:15,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We ban you!

1876
02:15:16,426 --> 02:15:17,386
[SPEAKER_07]: You can never play again.

1877
02:15:18,297 --> 02:15:18,997
[SPEAKER_07]: So there it is.

1878
02:15:19,338 --> 02:15:23,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently a lot of these banned players were long-time Final Fantasy XI players.

1879
02:15:24,680 --> 02:15:25,180
[SPEAKER_07]: So who knows?

1880
02:15:25,240 --> 02:15:26,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they did you a favor.

1881
02:15:30,623 --> 02:15:36,585
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but that's got to really suck to put a lot of time into a game like that and then suddenly wake up banned one day.

1882
02:15:38,524 --> 02:15:42,729
[SPEAKER_07]: and I get told in chat by my buddy Miklatov says, you couldn't if you wanted to, Rob.

1883
02:15:42,749 --> 02:15:44,030
[SPEAKER_07]: You never made it to Endgame.

1884
02:15:44,451 --> 02:15:44,851
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

1885
02:15:44,891 --> 02:15:45,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I never did make it to Endgame.

1886
02:15:45,972 --> 02:15:48,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I played how many years of Final Fantasy XI and I never got to Endgame?

1887
02:15:48,775 --> 02:15:50,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine months of WoW and I was in Endgame.

1888
02:15:50,897 --> 02:15:56,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sounds like if I played on Jamie's pirate server, I could probably get to Endgame content in Ragnarok in about an hour.

1889
02:15:57,705 --> 02:15:58,786
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1890
02:15:58,806 --> 02:16:00,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like 20 minutes.

1891
02:16:01,107 --> 02:16:02,468
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not even that, actually.

1892
02:16:02,548 --> 02:16:13,972
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you can get to level 150, no problem, after rebirth, but it does take longer to level to 255.

1893
02:16:14,692 --> 02:16:15,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's interesting, though.

1894
02:16:15,832 --> 02:16:26,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, man, you could say, hey, they cheated, they deserved it, but that's very interesting that they let this exploit go on for so long and then they retroactively did that.

1895
02:16:27,143 --> 02:16:27,943
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1896
02:16:28,103 --> 02:16:33,646
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're not hacking the game, if it's just like a bug in the game that did that, I don't think they should punish them at all.

1897
02:16:33,686 --> 02:16:42,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, to be honest, if it's your poor programming that's caused this duplication glitch, I think you should fix it and that's the end of it.

1898
02:16:42,469 --> 02:16:43,470
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1899
02:17:05,393 --> 02:17:30,008
[SPEAKER_07]: and this guild found this way to exploit the boss fight by I don't know you drag him to some type of lava or something and basically if you just let it go on and on and on for five hours you can win this fight so it's more of an endurance thing but you have to do it for five hours so they exploited it got the title for doing it because you get a title if you do it bragged about it on the official WoW forums and found themselves with a temporary ban

1900
02:17:31,929 --> 02:17:35,011
[SPEAKER_07]: All the people that were involved and got a rollback on the clock because of it.

1901
02:17:35,511 --> 02:17:36,132
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of lame.

1902
02:17:36,692 --> 02:17:44,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I was playing on IRO, if there were item duplication and things to happen like that, they'd do rollbacks.

1903
02:17:45,938 --> 02:17:46,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1904
02:17:47,339 --> 02:17:53,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, because you can't really, doing an inventory wipe of just one character would be kind of... Crappy.

1905
02:17:54,764 --> 02:17:55,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

1906
02:17:56,325 --> 02:17:58,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's going to do it for our stories tonight.

1907
02:17:58,066 --> 02:18:02,948
[SPEAKER_07]: We will get to last-minute stories very soon, but we do want to open it up to you guys and let you guys have a say and give us a call.

1908
02:18:03,228 --> 02:18:05,369
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to give us a call, our Skype line is open.

1909
02:18:05,449 --> 02:18:07,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1910
02:18:07,470 --> 02:18:11,491
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll-free in the United States and Canada.

1911
02:18:11,892 --> 02:18:13,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can give us a call on our Skype.

1912
02:18:13,692 --> 02:18:16,354
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Orange Lounge Radio is the name on Skype.

1913
02:18:16,954 --> 02:18:20,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have opened up the Skype line, and we're waiting for your calls.

1914
02:18:21,696 --> 02:18:27,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And so while we wait for the buffer from our live chatty to get to the people listening so they know it's open, do we have a quick last minute story, Loki?

1915
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:32,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, remember that patent that they had for a directional sensing DS card?

1916
02:18:33,082 --> 02:18:37,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently it's being used for some stargazing app that's coming to Japan.

1917
02:18:37,523 --> 02:18:38,844
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be kind of interesting, actually.

1918
02:18:38,884 --> 02:18:40,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the app's actually pretty expensive.

1919
02:18:40,444 --> 02:18:42,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 8,190 yen.

1920
02:18:42,625 --> 02:18:46,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh, it costs a lot for that kind of motion sensing technology.

1921
02:18:46,827 --> 02:18:48,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It charts over 9,300 stars, planets, suns, and moons.

1922
02:18:49,128 --> 02:18:49,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Strange.

1923
02:18:49,688 --> 02:18:50,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we got a call on the Skype line.

1924
02:18:50,768 --> 02:18:51,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to it.

1925
02:18:51,328 --> 02:18:52,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1926
02:18:53,009 --> 02:18:53,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

1927
02:18:53,909 --> 02:18:55,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.

1928
02:18:55,610 --> 02:18:57,891
[SPEAKER_05]: This is that guy that you can probably guess who it already is.

1929
02:18:58,993 --> 02:19:01,875
[SPEAKER_07]: In case there's people listening for the first time, you should probably introduce yourself.

1930
02:19:02,175 --> 02:19:03,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi guys, I'm Jason.

1931
02:19:03,316 --> 02:19:03,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi Jason.

1932
02:19:03,896 --> 02:19:05,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, our fearless webmaster.

1933
02:19:06,077 --> 02:19:07,478
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting a new website soon, right?

1934
02:19:07,978 --> 02:19:08,278
[SPEAKER_07]: We are.

1935
02:19:08,519 --> 02:19:09,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so freaking excited.

1936
02:19:09,839 --> 02:19:11,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you talked to Deke?

1937
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:17,704
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to come up with a title for him too because Jason is the webmaster, but Deke wrote the site.

1938
02:19:17,804 --> 02:19:19,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're going to have to think of a title for Deke too.

1939
02:19:21,482 --> 02:19:21,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1940
02:19:21,942 --> 02:19:26,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of trying to mull that over in my head and I hadn't come up with anything yet.

1941
02:19:26,785 --> 02:19:27,305
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll think about it.

1942
02:19:27,525 --> 02:19:29,827
[SPEAKER_05]: But definitely, credit is very important in all of this.

1943
02:19:30,007 --> 02:19:31,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, very, very important.

1944
02:19:31,427 --> 02:19:33,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have to think of a way to thank him publicly.

1945
02:19:33,308 --> 02:19:34,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll think of something.

1946
02:19:34,449 --> 02:19:36,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, Jason, what did you call about tonight?

1947
02:19:36,790 --> 02:19:39,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys talked about this in your gaming weeks.

1948
02:19:39,972 --> 02:19:41,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see it in the show role.

1949
02:19:41,373 --> 02:19:46,536
[SPEAKER_07]: People aren't supposed to know that you can see what we talk about before the show.

1950
02:19:47,799 --> 02:19:48,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I have secrets.

1951
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:51,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, what's up?

1952
02:19:51,061 --> 02:19:52,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Special privileges.

1953
02:19:52,682 --> 02:19:56,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Konami Digital Entertainment released a certain demo.

1954
02:19:57,625 --> 02:19:59,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember if it was last week or this.

1955
02:20:01,384 --> 02:20:20,672
[SPEAKER_07]: is it sparking any uh have you guys already talked about this last week yeah during my gaming week last week i mentioned i'm assuming you're talking about dance dance revolution light s or whatever it's called was this seriously last week yes actually here's the thing konami put out the press release this week but the game's actually been on the store for like 10 days

1956
02:20:21,906 --> 02:20:22,807
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1957
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:50,483
[SPEAKER_07]: You see a little placeholder for United States and I think, I'm assuming Britain, but there's nothing there.

1958
02:20:50,503 --> 02:20:51,424
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't press them.

1959
02:20:51,604 --> 02:20:53,625
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only go to the Japanese site, which I can't understand.

1960
02:20:53,985 --> 02:20:59,748
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought when I saw the press release... There you go.

1961
02:21:00,829 --> 02:21:02,010
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually going into it right now.

1962
02:21:04,271 --> 02:21:09,494
[SPEAKER_07]: My thought was that you would go to the website now that they put the press release out and you could actually look at the website now.

1963
02:21:09,534 --> 02:21:10,394
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, that's not up either.

1964
02:21:10,434 --> 02:21:13,216
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know why they waited until now to put out the press release, but they did.

1965
02:21:14,580 --> 02:21:15,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just that behind.

1966
02:21:15,661 --> 02:21:19,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I only saw this... I just kind of stumbled across it during the week.

1967
02:21:20,023 --> 02:21:24,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know there's also a Silent Hill game on the store?

1968
02:21:24,606 --> 02:21:31,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I saw it and I just didn't get it because I went to see... I went to their company little section of the iTunes store and I wanted to see what else they put up.

1969
02:21:32,031 --> 02:21:32,171
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

1970
02:21:33,081 --> 02:21:37,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even... They slapped Silent Hill sprites on a 3D maze game.

1971
02:21:37,523 --> 02:21:38,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even anything.

1972
02:21:38,943 --> 02:21:41,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Although the music's kind of cool, so I guess there's that.

1973
02:21:41,885 --> 02:21:43,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and Touch Konami still has not changed.

1974
02:21:43,865 --> 02:21:47,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan is deep black, and United States and Europe are gray, and you can't do it.

1975
02:21:47,867 --> 02:21:48,807
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, can't do it.

1976
02:21:49,027 --> 02:21:50,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what did you think of the demo?

1977
02:21:51,208 --> 02:21:52,209
[SPEAKER_07]: So what did you think of the demo?

1978
02:21:52,229 --> 02:21:54,470
[SPEAKER_07]: I already talked about it last week, and now you know to go back and listen.

1979
02:21:54,510 --> 02:21:55,750
[SPEAKER_07]: But what did you think of the demo?

1980
02:21:56,470 --> 02:22:00,292
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure is hell more impressive than any other mobile version of the game that's come out yet.

1981
02:22:01,462 --> 02:22:03,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The Xbox version had a better frame rate than the iPhone 1 does for me.

1982
02:22:12,643 --> 02:22:13,524
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1983
02:22:35,246 --> 02:22:37,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect Attack, those songs on real DDR.

1984
02:22:37,948 --> 02:22:40,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even get a full combo yet on the phone version.

1985
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:43,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I haven't managed to combo it either.

1986
02:22:43,392 --> 02:22:43,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough.

1987
02:22:45,354 --> 02:22:46,054
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a demo.

1988
02:22:46,094 --> 02:22:46,534
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free.

1989
02:22:46,594 --> 02:22:47,435
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to knock it.

1990
02:22:47,475 --> 02:22:48,716
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR fans will eat it up.

1991
02:22:48,856 --> 02:22:53,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on how expensive it is, I'm considering getting it when they actually release it.

1992
02:22:53,619 --> 02:22:56,742
[SPEAKER_07]: That is what they're trying to sell their finalized product on, so we'll see.

1993
02:22:57,996 --> 02:23:19,775
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's it is technically impressive for what it is there's a character in the background I haven't actually sat down and really started memorizing it to see if it's random or not but there's a nice series of visualizations uh everything in the game looks damn near the the way it should be the way it has been a character in the background the music quality is beautiful uh

1994
02:23:20,177 --> 02:23:46,696
[SPEAKER_05]: it's impressive and I just have to see how much they're going to charge for it when it actually comes out you have to remember despite all my bitching about song list and everything I mean frame rate and everything you have to remember it's a freaking cell phone game and not bad for a cell phone for a cell phone game alright anyhow and like I said especially compared to all of their other mobile releases thus far which is also a very hard comparison but it's still very valid true any other thoughts Jason before we let you go

1995
02:23:47,635 --> 02:23:48,915
[SPEAKER_05]: My arms hurt a whole lot.

1996
02:23:49,195 --> 02:23:49,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to hear it.

1997
02:23:49,736 --> 02:23:51,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate reading furniture.

1998
02:23:51,596 --> 02:23:59,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to make a masturbation joke, but I guess since you've actually moved, you have a legitimate excuse, and I'll let you go just this once without making a joke at your expense.

1999
02:24:00,178 --> 02:24:01,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, bye Jason.

2000
02:24:02,038 --> 02:24:02,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Night.

2001
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:04,459
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to give us a call?

2002
02:24:04,479 --> 02:24:08,520
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2003
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:10,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, another story to tide us over?

2004
02:24:10,834 --> 02:24:11,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.

2005
02:24:12,175 --> 02:24:12,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2006
02:24:13,116 --> 02:24:19,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's another WiiWare title that we forgot to talk about, Pulse Big Adventure, which is coming from Sega.

2007
02:24:20,202 --> 02:24:22,684
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a parody of a bunch of 8-bit games.

2008
02:24:22,824 --> 02:24:34,994
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes place, I guess, it's developed by the Phantasy Star Universe producer, and there are 100 hidden gags in the game, including, for example, if you eat a mushroom, your character will grow beyond the size of the screen.

2009
02:24:35,134 --> 02:24:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Very ironic, considering DarkSakura was just a minute ago talking about, you know, in part A, I should say, about an hour ago, talking about a 8-bit parody Sega game.

2010
02:24:44,176 --> 02:24:44,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2011
02:24:45,117 --> 02:24:45,917
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no.

2012
02:24:46,017 --> 02:24:48,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she was talking about, like, Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

2013
02:24:48,277 --> 02:24:49,198
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what I'm making reference to.

2014
02:24:49,218 --> 02:24:50,898
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just funny that all these years... And Mario.

2015
02:24:51,278 --> 02:24:51,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2016
02:24:51,738 --> 02:24:56,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm watching a little big plan at Super Mario Sack Brothers level.

2017
02:24:56,419 --> 02:24:57,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I've played that level.

2018
02:24:57,700 --> 02:24:58,160
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

2019
02:24:58,220 --> 02:24:59,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, the phone lit up again.

2020
02:24:59,160 --> 02:24:59,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go to it.

2021
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:00,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, caller.

2022
02:25:00,780 --> 02:25:02,181
[SPEAKER_07]: You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2023
02:25:02,221 --> 02:25:02,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2024
02:25:03,955 --> 02:25:05,015
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Spazinator.

2025
02:25:05,595 --> 02:25:07,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2026
02:25:09,016 --> 02:25:11,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to double check and make sure I heard you right.

2027
02:25:11,737 --> 02:25:15,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just say earlier in the show that you gave up WoW?

2028
02:25:16,538 --> 02:25:17,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Run that by me again.

2029
02:25:18,638 --> 02:25:20,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say that you gave up WoW?

2030
02:25:21,459 --> 02:25:27,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, earlier in the show on Part A, I'm taking a long, extended, long, long break from WoW.

2031
02:25:29,212 --> 02:25:33,415
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, I may want to check to see if you're like breaking a fever or anything like that.

2032
02:25:33,435 --> 02:25:34,476
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that doesn't seem to really...

2033
02:25:55,859 --> 02:26:09,928
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, make a whole lot of sense, you know, simply because I know you are a big fan of WoW and DarkSakura is a big fan of Ragnarok, you know, you guys give real folks games and it seems a lot of place, you know?

2034
02:26:10,519 --> 02:26:18,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a huge fan of WoW, but I was a bigger fan of the people that play WoW and the people that I interacted with in my guild, but it's not like I'm dead.

2035
02:26:18,407 --> 02:26:22,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And many of those people I already knew before I played WoW and I will continue to know.

2036
02:26:22,771 --> 02:26:26,474
[SPEAKER_07]: But WoW was just getting to the point where it was like a second job and...

2037
02:26:27,555 --> 02:26:28,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need to take a break.

2038
02:26:28,716 --> 02:26:29,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not knocking the game.

2039
02:26:29,977 --> 02:26:34,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Blizzard has put a phenomenal game out there that people give a lot of unnecessary shit to.

2040
02:26:35,621 --> 02:26:39,644
[SPEAKER_07]: For the show, this is going to be great because I've got a million video games to catch up on.

2041
02:26:39,985 --> 02:26:40,525
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be great.

2042
02:26:42,426 --> 02:26:54,415
[SPEAKER_00]: For what it's worth, I know you kind of touched on it a little while ago, but if you're looking for another MMO, personally, I can recommend Final Fantasy XI.

2043
02:26:54,535 --> 02:26:54,595
[SPEAKER_00]: It

2044
02:26:55,868 --> 02:27:05,050
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at least on the two servers that I'm on, which are Odin and Alexander, there's a lot of really great people on there.

2045
02:27:05,070 --> 02:27:16,693
[SPEAKER_00]: We're constantly doing stuff, whether it be stuff for the new expansion, Wings of the Goddess.

2046
02:27:16,853 --> 02:27:18,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta say this, Spazinator.

2047
02:27:19,433 --> 02:27:22,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki and I actually played Final Fantasy XI for like three years.

2048
02:27:23,857 --> 02:27:25,238
[SPEAKER_07]: for an ungodly long time.

2049
02:27:25,979 --> 02:27:34,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear a lot has changed in the time I was away while I was gone in WoW and a lot of it sounds really interesting but it's just kind of a place I'm not really interested in going back to.

2050
02:27:34,947 --> 02:27:36,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, not knocking the game.

2051
02:27:36,649 --> 02:27:38,531
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of great things about Final Fantasy XI.

2052
02:27:38,691 --> 02:27:39,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you guys have a blast.

2053
02:27:40,112 --> 02:27:44,256
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think for me right now, I don't want to quit an MMO to just go play another MMO.

2054
02:27:44,656 --> 02:27:47,359
[SPEAKER_07]: At least until the Star Trek MMO comes out.

2055
02:27:47,739 --> 02:27:48,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, true.

2056
02:27:48,099 --> 02:27:49,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thanks for taking my call.

2057
02:27:49,440 --> 02:27:51,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to take up too much more of your time.

2058
02:27:51,922 --> 02:27:54,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned there's probably a lot of people trying to call in, so...

2059
02:28:16,258 --> 02:28:17,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the call, Spazinator.

2060
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:18,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

2061
02:28:41,020 --> 02:28:43,082
[SPEAKER_07]: A comment from RicePrincess who's listening right now.

2062
02:28:43,102 --> 02:28:44,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course you love RicePrincess.

2063
02:28:44,223 --> 02:28:45,344
[SPEAKER_07]: She was here last week.

2064
02:28:46,285 --> 02:28:49,187
[SPEAKER_07]: If Rob's going to play an MMO again, it's going to be Hello Kitty Online.

2065
02:28:49,727 --> 02:28:51,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tempting, Hello Kitty Online.

2066
02:28:52,049 --> 02:28:53,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tempting to at least look.

2067
02:28:53,731 --> 02:28:54,792
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Hello Kitty Online.

2068
02:28:55,132 --> 02:28:55,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I believe it's free.

2069
02:28:55,892 --> 02:28:56,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's free.

2070
02:28:56,393 --> 02:28:57,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to do this.

2071
02:28:57,654 --> 02:28:58,014
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2072
02:28:58,034 --> 02:29:00,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Other one looked interesting.

2073
02:29:00,036 --> 02:29:01,357
[SPEAKER_07]: 1877 GameOLR, Orange Lounge Radio.

2074
02:29:01,477 --> 02:29:01,997
[SPEAKER_07]: What, DarkSakura?

2075
02:29:02,578 --> 02:29:03,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Hello Kitty.

2076
02:29:04,679 --> 02:29:05,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

2077
02:29:05,381 --> 02:29:05,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

2078
02:29:06,062 --> 02:29:09,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say they keep advertising that free... What is it?

2079
02:29:09,649 --> 02:29:12,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Fusion... I think Fusion Fall or something like that.

2080
02:29:12,696 --> 02:29:13,718
[SPEAKER_08]: The Cartoon Network game.

2081
02:29:13,998 --> 02:29:14,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

2082
02:29:14,499 --> 02:29:15,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2083
02:29:15,936 --> 02:29:20,597
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, again, I have such a huge backlog of, like, Xbox and PlayStation 3 games I need to play.

2084
02:29:21,498 --> 02:29:22,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to look for another MMO right now.

2085
02:29:24,359 --> 02:29:35,942
[SPEAKER_07]: The only exception I might make is something like, actually, something like Phantasy Star Online actually sounds like a lot of fun because, you know, as DarkSakura said, you can play it forever or you can play it for, like, five minutes, pretty much.

2086
02:29:35,982 --> 02:29:37,082
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just do one little area.

2087
02:29:37,742 --> 02:29:40,463
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds more tempting than anything else I've heard so far.

2088
02:29:41,364 --> 02:29:42,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2089
02:29:42,324 --> 02:29:42,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2090
02:29:44,935 --> 02:29:45,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yellow, Dammit

2091
02:30:03,406 --> 02:30:04,246
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to say?

2092
02:30:05,487 --> 02:30:09,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've played a few more PC games.

2093
02:30:11,329 --> 02:30:14,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, I haven't quit WoW.

2094
02:30:16,151 --> 02:30:18,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of WoW, I haven't quit WoW either.

2095
02:30:18,832 --> 02:30:22,794
[SPEAKER_04]: But this month I can't play because I'm too poor to actually pay for it.

2096
02:30:23,634 --> 02:30:28,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, what was I going to say?

2097
02:30:28,577 --> 02:30:28,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Fear 2.

2098
02:30:32,375 --> 02:30:34,837
[SPEAKER_04]: The demo was released.

2099
02:30:35,517 --> 02:30:47,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, somebody sent me a Twitter message telling me I had, I don't know if it was you, somebody on Twitter, I think it was Twitter, sent me a message, Twitter or Facebook, sent me a message saying you need to check out Fear 2, it's the best demo I've played in a long time.

2100
02:30:48,026 --> 02:30:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I did queue it up on my PlayStation 3 to check out, so I will definitely see that for next week, but I'm assuming you've already played it.

2101
02:30:56,092 --> 02:31:00,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I played it, of course I played it on a PC, and

2102
02:31:02,339 --> 02:31:15,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, it, it, well, it has, the most funny thing, the thing is that, well, the last five minutes of the demo is really kicking ass.

2103
02:31:16,768 --> 02:31:23,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even sure if I'm going to spoil it, but, well, you get to pilot this mecha thingy.

2104
02:31:25,394 --> 02:31:28,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to pilot a mech thingy?

2105
02:31:29,364 --> 02:31:34,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you get to pilot some sort of robot, whatever... Strange.

2106
02:31:34,948 --> 02:31:35,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

2107
02:31:35,708 --> 02:31:51,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, is it actually... Especially since, if I remember right, the developers of Fear 2, Monolith, has, like, ain't there, like, they released an old game of theirs called, what is it, uh...

2108
02:31:52,364 --> 02:31:56,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Shogun, Mobile, Assault, whatever, yada yada, something.

2109
02:31:57,048 --> 02:32:03,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was a hybrid of a bit of everything.

2110
02:32:04,875 --> 02:32:12,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Since in that game you could pilot big robots, and they are quite big fans of piloting robots.

2111
02:32:13,944 --> 02:32:16,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my question about Fear 2.

2112
02:32:16,706 --> 02:32:17,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it scary?

2113
02:32:19,639 --> 02:32:20,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was.

2114
02:32:22,300 --> 02:32:37,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, well, if you're gonna play it on PS3, I don't even know, but I will say this, apparently it requires the almost hefty computer to play.

2115
02:32:37,847 --> 02:32:48,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I can say that, well, I've played it on my old, one of the first generation Core Duo 2, and it rolled just fine.

2116
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:57,032
[SPEAKER_04]: but then again I didn't crank it up until like massive so hmm and what more?

2117
02:32:57,312 --> 02:33:09,555
[SPEAKER_04]: oh yeah, Dawn of War 2 has been the multiplayer beta for that has started oh and how's that going?

2118
02:33:10,795 --> 02:33:18,737
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going just fine it's really like well it's sort of

2119
02:33:19,329 --> 02:33:19,790
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

2120
02:33:37,512 --> 02:33:41,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Hear our story earlier about the brick-and-mortar store GameStop, huge here in the U.S.

2121
02:33:41,875 --> 02:33:42,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you have them over there.

2122
02:33:43,297 --> 02:33:48,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Refusing, well, rumor, refusing to sell this game in their stores because of the digital distribution.

2123
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:49,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that would hurt this game?

2124
02:33:51,202 --> 02:33:56,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the other thing, is that, well, I don't even...

2125
02:33:59,836 --> 02:34:00,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It might do.

2126
02:34:00,756 --> 02:34:01,976
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the other thing.

2127
02:34:03,277 --> 02:34:09,880
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I got into the beta due to the following fact that I did bought Soulstorm on Steam.

2128
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:21,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And since THQ does have most of their games on Steam, or at least a few of them, that was due to that.

2129
02:34:22,557 --> 02:34:25,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Tabula Rasa has entered its free play state of something.

2130
02:34:25,458 --> 02:34:30,079
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be a good one, because at least I know the plug's going to get pulled on Tabula Rasa before too long, so I can't get that sucked into it.

2131
02:34:49,625 --> 02:34:50,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Good suggestion.

2132
02:34:50,806 --> 02:34:52,408
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Ake, we've got to let you go, buddy.

2133
02:34:52,728 --> 02:34:53,308
[SPEAKER_07]: But have a good one.

2134
02:34:54,109 --> 02:34:56,031
[SPEAKER_07]: All the way from Sweden, my friends.

02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:03,541
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I guess basically it's been going off with Microsoft and everything.

2147
02:36:03,662 --> 02:36:14,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much you reap what you sow in terms of delivering products which basically call for people to get laid off.

2148
02:36:15,885 --> 02:36:20,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, are we talking about the whole Windows Vista being blamed for the recent Microsoft layoffs?

2149
02:36:21,457 --> 02:36:26,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, well, either that or they're just trying to like, you know, trying to outsource the rest of the jobs.

2150
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:34,024
[SPEAKER_03]: But besides the point, it just sucks to see that, you know, the folks at Flight Simulator, the folks who created Flight Simulator are pretty much getting canned.

2151
02:36:34,742 --> 02:36:36,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they didn't have anything to do.

2152
02:36:36,483 --> 02:36:38,504
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a damn good tool for pilots.

2153
02:36:38,544 --> 02:36:40,265
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a game I remember from when I was a kid.

2154
02:36:40,625 --> 02:36:46,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only is it a game, but it's like a resource for people who are really big into flying.

2155
02:36:46,128 --> 02:36:46,808
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.

2156
02:36:47,309 --> 02:36:48,529
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to call that a game.

2157
02:36:48,589 --> 02:36:50,050
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is a simulator.

2158
02:36:50,810 --> 02:36:54,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can be considered a game in that sense.

2159
02:36:55,013 --> 02:36:55,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you do it.

2160
02:36:56,700 --> 02:37:02,104
[SPEAKER_03]: To each his own, whoever enjoys flying around for several hours in a virtual plane.

2161
02:37:02,484 --> 02:37:04,266
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not into hip-hop, unfortunately.

2162
02:37:27,517 --> 02:37:51,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are certain songs in 2DX, for example, you know, certain other songs that are, like, you know, faster to scratch on, like, ah, damn, I wish I could name them off the top of my head, but, yeah, I mean, it's each his own, I guess, as long as it allows a person to actually, you know, literally scratch on the DJ, I mean, on the turntable.

2163
02:37:52,600 --> 02:38:03,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the controller for it is actually any good, if it's just like Kraken DJ with only two turntables and maybe a crossfader, it could be a lot more realistic than 2DX.

2164
02:38:03,323 --> 02:38:07,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides that, download that Fear 2 demo.

2165
02:38:14,625 --> 02:38:18,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care for what system you have, PS3, 360, or PC, get that shit.

2166
02:38:19,128 --> 02:38:19,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

2167
02:38:19,528 --> 02:38:20,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get it now.

2168
02:38:20,269 --> 02:38:20,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

2169
02:38:20,769 --> 02:38:21,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it fucking now.

2170
02:38:21,890 --> 02:38:23,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it, because Zaku told me to.

2171
02:38:24,131 --> 02:38:25,272
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Zaku, you have a good one.

2172
02:38:26,372 --> 02:38:26,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2173
02:38:30,615 --> 02:38:31,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, Zaku.

2174
02:38:31,616 --> 02:38:31,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

2175
02:38:34,199 --> 02:38:34,739
[SPEAKER_07]: He's awesome.

2176
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Several OLR listeners I've met in person.

2177
02:38:39,641 --> 02:38:42,602
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I am trying to get back to New York City this year, just a heads up, folks.

2178
02:38:42,762 --> 02:38:44,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know when, but it's one of my goals.

2179
02:38:45,723 --> 02:38:48,364
[SPEAKER_07]: If I told you why I'm really going to New York City, though, you'd laugh at me.

2180
02:38:48,404 --> 02:38:51,285
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do have a friend that lives out there, as you all know, and I'm trying to get back out there this year.

2181
02:38:51,465 --> 02:38:52,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Want to hear something awesome?

2182
02:38:52,545 --> 02:38:53,266
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that, Louie?

2183
02:38:53,486 --> 02:38:59,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're thinking of, because I remember I have that company vacation that I can take, that $1,500 one.

2184
02:38:59,988 --> 02:39:00,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2185
02:39:00,308 --> 02:39:02,929
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were going to go to Seattle, but...

2186
02:39:03,709 --> 02:39:06,191
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of boring if you just go there for Seattle.

2187
02:39:06,211 --> 02:39:07,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Seattle!

2188
02:39:07,171 --> 02:39:08,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, whatever, okay.

2189
02:39:08,832 --> 02:39:10,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we're thinking going to Disneyland instead.

2190
02:39:11,934 --> 02:39:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: But now, since Conan O'Brien's taking over for Jay Leno, he films in L.A.

2191
02:39:17,338 --> 02:39:18,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh, that's true, that's true.

2192
02:39:19,179 --> 02:39:19,960
[SPEAKER_08]: When's he starting?

2193
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:20,760
[SPEAKER_08]: In the summer?

2194
02:39:21,601 --> 02:39:22,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon, I think.

2195
02:39:22,681 --> 02:39:25,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they're already saying he's filming in L.A.

2196
02:39:25,683 --> 02:39:27,545
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to spend your $1,500 vacation on L.A.?

2197
02:39:27,565 --> 02:39:29,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, no offense, but you can drive to L.A.

2198
02:39:29,946 --> 02:39:30,807
[SPEAKER_07]: on the weekend, for God's sake.

2199
02:39:30,827 --> 02:39:32,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Nelly hasn't been there yet.

2200
02:39:34,841 --> 02:39:37,483
[SPEAKER_07]: You should go to the East Coast.

2201
02:39:37,624 --> 02:39:39,005
[SPEAKER_07]: New York City is a wonderful place to go.

2202
02:39:39,025 --> 02:39:40,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but the thing is, they only cover $1,500.

2203
02:39:40,946 --> 02:39:43,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's the flight right there.

2204
02:39:43,729 --> 02:39:45,290
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want to spend it.

2205
02:39:45,310 --> 02:39:47,351
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can get a JetBlue flight out of Sacramento for $250.

2206
02:39:49,059 --> 02:39:49,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Disneyland!

2207
02:40:10,057 --> 02:40:11,157
[SPEAKER_07]: and Disneyland is pretty fabulous.

2208
02:40:11,197 --> 02:40:13,478
[SPEAKER_08]: We would go to Disneyland and maybe Universal Studios.

2209
02:40:13,898 --> 02:40:20,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to see Conan though since my dream to go to Price is Right with Bob Barker hosting is long past.

2210
02:40:20,980 --> 02:40:22,361
[SPEAKER_07]: You should still go to Price is Right.

2211
02:40:22,761 --> 02:40:25,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see Loki and the wife on a game show.

2212
02:40:25,502 --> 02:40:26,502
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want to see.

2213
02:40:29,161 --> 02:40:34,003
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys need to go on one of those low-budget game shows like Lingo.

2214
02:40:34,183 --> 02:40:35,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have the game show appeal.

2215
02:40:35,863 --> 02:40:42,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not like some crazy redneck or like, you know... Dude, you do a radio show on the internet about video games.

2216
02:40:42,065 --> 02:40:42,705
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty awesome niche.

2217
02:40:42,745 --> 02:40:43,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And no one gives a shit.

2218
02:40:44,166 --> 02:40:45,226
[SPEAKER_08]: No one gives a shit.

2219
02:40:45,266 --> 02:40:48,127
[SPEAKER_08]: You tell them that, they're like... Yeah.

2220
02:40:48,707 --> 02:40:49,788
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not in the military, are you?

2221
02:40:50,068 --> 02:40:50,308
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

2222
02:40:50,808 --> 02:40:53,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, you go back to the audience portion of the...

2223
02:40:54,672 --> 02:40:55,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2224
02:40:56,093 --> 02:40:57,834
[SPEAKER_08]: They would never call me on one of those shows.

2225
02:40:59,516 --> 02:41:01,397
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be awesome, but no, they would never do that.

2226
02:41:01,637 --> 02:41:02,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Never, ever, ever.

2227
02:41:03,298 --> 02:41:08,742
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like I've given up on getting the Employee of the Month thing at my work because that'll never, ever happen.

2228
02:41:09,062 --> 02:41:09,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this.

2229
02:41:09,763 --> 02:41:12,805
[SPEAKER_07]: D5T1, I don't know if there's an easier way to pronounce that in chat.

2230
02:41:12,845 --> 02:41:15,227
[SPEAKER_07]: D5T1 suggests Supermarket Sweep.

2231
02:41:16,688 --> 02:41:18,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, dude, Supermarket Sweep is awesome.

2232
02:41:18,269 --> 02:41:19,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that still on TV?

2233
02:41:19,209 --> 02:41:20,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they make new episodes.

2234
02:41:20,911 --> 02:41:22,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's on PAX or something.

2235
02:41:22,412 --> 02:41:22,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I think...

2236
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:26,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Surely, is that guy still hosting shows?

2237
02:41:26,242 --> 02:41:26,842
[SPEAKER_07]: He could be.

2238
02:41:26,923 --> 02:41:27,783
[SPEAKER_07]: They could still be doing it.

2239
02:41:27,803 --> 02:41:28,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Supermarket Sweep's awesome.

2240
02:41:29,785 --> 02:41:30,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd go to the supermarket.

2241
02:41:30,685 --> 02:41:32,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Loki would like load that cart up with those turkeys.

2242
02:41:34,468 --> 02:41:35,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Be awesome.

2243
02:41:36,650 --> 02:41:38,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all of us want to go on Supermarket Sweep.

2244
02:41:38,772 --> 02:41:40,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't want to go on Supermarket Sweep?

2245
02:41:42,855 --> 02:41:49,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, I'm actually, thanks to the powers of Wikipedia, I'm looking it up right now.

2246
02:41:50,510 --> 02:41:52,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, no, it looks like it went off the air in 2003.

2247
02:41:52,352 --> 02:41:56,096
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably still run it in repeats, but that's that.

2248
02:41:56,356 --> 02:41:57,137
[SPEAKER_07]: 2003 is when it stopped.

2249
02:41:57,217 --> 02:42:00,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't hate New York, it's just it's so damn expensive to travel there.

2250
02:42:01,102 --> 02:42:04,405
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not... New York was my first pick.

2251
02:42:05,506 --> 02:42:09,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just, you know, it wouldn't work out as far as, like, you know...

2252
02:42:10,856 --> 02:42:12,417
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to spend our own money.

2253
02:42:12,557 --> 02:42:18,880
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problem is that $1,500 can only be used on the hotel and on travel.

2254
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:24,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think we can do... It's all weird because it has to be booked through Expedia and stuff like that.

2255
02:42:25,142 --> 02:42:25,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2256
02:42:25,623 --> 02:42:26,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lame.

2257
02:42:26,763 --> 02:42:29,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to find you a fun $1,500 trip that's better than L.A.

2258
02:42:29,925 --> 02:42:30,845
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make it my mission for $1,500.

2259
02:42:31,145 --> 02:42:33,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's only certain cities I can go to.

2260
02:42:33,846 --> 02:42:34,167
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2261
02:42:34,187 --> 02:42:34,427
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2262
02:42:34,447 --> 02:42:34,707
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

2263
02:42:34,727 --> 02:42:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2264
02:42:35,447 --> 02:42:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually am going on vacation again.

2265
02:42:38,771 --> 02:42:41,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to make sure that I said something about it.

2266
02:42:41,834 --> 02:42:43,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really a vacation, it's more like a family visit.

2267
02:42:44,377 --> 02:42:45,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to Washington.

2268
02:42:46,940 --> 02:42:48,221
[SPEAKER_02]: To Prosser, Washington.

2269
02:42:48,241 --> 02:42:50,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, does that mean you're going to be gone next week?

2270
02:42:50,984 --> 02:42:51,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2271
02:42:51,805 --> 02:42:52,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what a bummer.

2272
02:42:53,587 --> 02:42:53,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2273
02:42:54,608 --> 02:42:54,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2274
02:42:54,928 --> 02:42:57,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt I'll have internet or anything.

2275
02:42:58,154 --> 02:42:59,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, gosh, DarkSakura.

2276
02:42:59,434 --> 02:43:01,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to visit Dan's family.

2277
02:43:01,555 --> 02:43:06,377
[SPEAKER_08]: No offense, Ranma, I'm not going to go crash with you if I travel to New York City with my wife.

2278
02:43:06,897 --> 02:43:08,658
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's not going to happen.

2279
02:43:08,778 --> 02:43:11,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Him and the wife want to have lots of sex while they're on vacation.

2280
02:43:11,759 --> 02:43:13,580
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to do it in your spare bedroom.

2281
02:43:13,640 --> 02:43:17,061
[SPEAKER_08]: No, if we're going to go on vacation, we're going to go on vacation in a nice hotel and stuff like that.

2282
02:43:17,081 --> 02:43:19,062
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to just go crash at someone's house.

2283
02:43:20,499 --> 02:43:23,683
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something like if I was going to an anime convention or something in New York City.

2284
02:43:23,723 --> 02:43:24,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, Nelly would freak.

2285
02:43:24,865 --> 02:43:26,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if it were just me.

2286
02:43:27,027 --> 02:43:27,828
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know the wife.

2287
02:43:28,269 --> 02:43:32,334
[SPEAKER_08]: If it were just me traveling to New York City for something, then yeah, that would be probably fine.

2288
02:43:32,374 --> 02:43:34,277
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, not with the wife.

2289
02:43:34,357 --> 02:43:35,358
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that doesn't work that way.

2290
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

2291
02:43:39,001 --> 02:43:40,962
[SPEAKER_07]: We gotta wrap up the show and get the hell out of here.

2292
02:43:41,942 --> 02:43:43,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Get everybody's final thoughts.

2293
02:43:43,223 --> 02:43:47,685
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, welcome back and see you next in two weeks, I guess.

2294
02:43:48,045 --> 02:43:55,028
[SPEAKER_07]: What a bummer, because next week we have the... Bobby's not on the air, so we got a lot of time to kill next week, so we'll see what happens.

2295
02:43:55,489 --> 02:43:57,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But enjoy the trip to Prosser.

2296
02:43:58,850 --> 02:43:59,470
[SPEAKER_02]: We're driving.

2297
02:44:00,191 --> 02:44:01,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pretty drive, though.

2298
02:44:01,091 --> 02:44:01,732
[SPEAKER_02]: 17 fucking hours!

2299
02:44:06,297 --> 02:44:07,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Make the best of it.

2300
02:44:07,057 --> 02:44:07,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Take pictures.

2301
02:44:07,878 --> 02:44:08,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring it back.

2302
02:44:10,058 --> 02:44:11,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Get to be with your hubby.

2303
02:44:13,019 --> 02:44:14,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Any final thoughts on the show before we go?

2304
02:44:17,201 --> 02:44:17,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some ice cream.

2305
02:44:18,961 --> 02:44:20,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice cream does sound delicious.

2306
02:44:20,242 --> 02:44:20,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Very delicious.

2307
02:44:21,883 --> 02:44:28,805
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is the only thing better than ice cream is that ice cream that was made out of Samoas.

2308
02:44:28,845 --> 02:44:30,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't care what they call them now.

2309
02:44:30,586 --> 02:44:32,266
[SPEAKER_07]: The Caramel Delight sort of the crap Samoas.

2310
02:44:33,527 --> 02:44:34,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's your final thought?

2311
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:38,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Final thought is I need to find a song for Cagematch.

2312
02:44:38,193 --> 02:44:39,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I know which song I want, but it's in my car.

2313
02:44:39,994 --> 02:44:41,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I think you won the last time we did a Cagematch.

2314
02:44:42,357 --> 02:44:46,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I also like the song by Uncle called Burn My Shadow.

2315
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:53,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the new teaser trailer for Fuel, which is going to be the next kick-ass racing game I'm really into.

2316
02:44:54,267 --> 02:45:00,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, from the creators of Dirt and Grid, they're doing a racing game basically that's in an alternate...

2317
02:45:01,593 --> 02:45:10,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Future where weather has changed the face of earth and basically you're like racing through tornadoes and shit.

2318
02:45:10,502 --> 02:45:11,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So that sounds awesome.

2319
02:45:12,825 --> 02:45:15,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they actually have a video of racing through tornadoes.

2320
02:45:16,108 --> 02:45:17,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm down with that.

2321
02:45:20,929 --> 02:45:22,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, this is kind of a bummer.

2322
02:45:22,570 --> 02:45:24,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Final thought from YYR in our chatroom.

2323
02:45:24,591 --> 02:45:26,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, he's the man who made Snake360.

2324
02:45:26,911 --> 02:45:27,952
[SPEAKER_07]: We had him on the show a few weeks ago.

2325
02:45:28,352 --> 02:45:31,213
[SPEAKER_07]: As of right now, the Snake360 contests are now over.

2326
02:45:31,753 --> 02:45:35,275
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the major gaming sites for not covering them because not enough people entered.

2327
02:45:35,655 --> 02:45:38,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even give away all the prizes.

2328
02:45:39,136 --> 02:45:39,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Bummer.

2329
02:45:39,756 --> 02:45:40,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to hear it.

2330
02:45:40,776 --> 02:45:41,537
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take your prizes.

2331
02:45:42,357 --> 02:45:46,958
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, in all seriousness, as I was telling somebody, I gave somebody advice earlier in the week.

2332
02:45:46,978 --> 02:45:51,639
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, so sometimes it takes a long time.

2333
02:45:51,659 --> 02:46:00,781
[SPEAKER_07]: We did OLR for many, many years with only like a dozen people listening before we finally broke it and got two dozen people listening, and that's about where we're at now.

2334
02:46:03,211 --> 02:46:13,486
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but again, and I say this at the end of every show, remember, it's the community that helps make Orange Lounge Radio, and without you guys, life would suck a lot, and we would not be as motivated to do the program.

2335
02:46:13,506 --> 02:46:17,071
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you guys, as always, for tuning into this program and spending your Sunday nights with us.

2336
02:46:18,533 --> 02:46:21,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, if you like the show, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.

2337
02:46:22,274 --> 02:46:30,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Help us spread the word because, again, we don't have any major... We don't get covered by the major gaming sites either unless they're accusing Loki of breaking an NDA or something.

2338
02:46:30,817 --> 02:46:32,438
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't get any coverage from major gaming sites either.

2339
02:46:32,738 --> 02:46:34,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So we only get word of mouth.

2340
02:46:34,759 --> 02:46:35,359
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really it.

2341
02:46:35,419 --> 02:46:38,760
[SPEAKER_07]: So leave us a nice review on iTunes or any other podcast site.

2342
02:46:39,060 --> 02:46:40,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Help spread the word for Orange Lounge Radio.

2343
02:46:41,101 --> 02:46:45,703
[SPEAKER_07]: But until next time, myself, DarkSakura in two weeks, and Loki next week.

2344
02:46:45,723 --> 02:46:46,363
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back.

2345
02:46:48,430 --> 02:46:49,836
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2346
02:46:51,317 --> 02:46:54,078
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2347
02:46:54,618 --> 02:46:57,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2348
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:06,923
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2349
02:47:07,423 --> 02:47:19,027
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but were probably right anyway.

2350
02:47:19,608 --> 02:47:20,428
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!
