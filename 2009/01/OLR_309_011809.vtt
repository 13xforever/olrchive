Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Molok.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, January 18, 2009.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Could we see the DSI released in April for the U.S.?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Circuit City goes under.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
And are the.hack games set to make a comeback?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
We are back after a little bit of a break.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Took a little break last week because I was in Hawaii taking a little vacation.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
But I'm back now and refreshed and feeling better.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you for the next several hours.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Not joining us tonight, sadly, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
She has the night off. It's her last week before going back to school.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
So she's taking care of some things around the house.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
But we have somebody filling in tonight.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I called the other woman that I know. The other female gamer I know.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
So say hello to Rice Princess.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm your mistress.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
That's right. How you doing, Rice Princess?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, I'm okay. How about yourself?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm doing great.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
It's good to hear.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
I see you're wearing a Silent Hill t-shirt showing your love for Pyramid Head.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, because I thought the camera was going to be working tonight.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
And I did my hair and everything.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Well, here's the funny thing. I know you look very cute, by the way.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Thanks.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I could take a picture and post it to the website or something.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
All in vain.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I know. Well, I get to see you and that's important.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, because you're not gay at all.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Okay. Here's the thing is that I was going to say you and Jamie both have Silent Hill shirts that you wear to the show.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
So we need to get you both here sometime and you can be twinsies.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Are they the same shirt?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
No.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, okay.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
It's a slightly different one.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Mine's thermal so it keeps me warm.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
I see. That's good because we have like a cold garage.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Kind of, yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
A little bit.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
So I'm going to survive tonight.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
All right. Well, I'm going to get the heater on in just a minute.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
But thank you also for bringing Snickerdoodles to the show.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
You're welcome.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Because you know bribing us with food always freaking rocks.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yep. Always.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
All right.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki, who's joining us tonight.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Hello.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
How are you doing, Loki?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Doing fine.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Great. How was your week off? What did you end up doing?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Trying to get Grand Theft Auto PC to work.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
It's taken a turn for the worst.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
It's like, I don't know.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
It was doing so well.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
It was working just fine.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
And all of a sudden, Rockstar's like, ah, fuck this shit.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
We're not going to work no matter what you do now.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
I've reinstalled it like eight times now.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
And I've uninstalled the other things that remotely might be related to it.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And it just does not want to work.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And apparently I'm not alone.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
And yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Well, I'm sorry to hear that Grand Theft Auto has not been cooperating with you.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Are you looking forward to just hacking the game to your heart's content?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Well, that's what I was doing.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
And then it caused the crash.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And then I had to reload it or something because it wasn't working correctly.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And then it just hasn't worked correctly since.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
And there's no reason that it shouldn't be because I just still know.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
So I give up.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I actually bought this game.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
And see, that teaches me for not pirating this shit.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
See what happens?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
If I buy it, it breaks.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
And it sucks.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
If I had just downloaded it like I should have, wouldn't have this problem.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Let that be a lesson to you all.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Seriously.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Okay.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Well, all right.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Well, hey, you I had tuned in because also last week we missed our buddy Bobby.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Bobby Black Wolf does a show before us here on All Games Radio.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
And he does the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sundays.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
But he just launched a new Friday night show, right?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Friday night gaming.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And you tried to play Grand Theft Auto on the first show, right?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Oh, yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Oh, yeah, that was even more fun.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Let's see.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah, for some reason then Xbox Live said,

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
No, you're never going to connect to this game ever if you even want to.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I tried four different times.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I even reset my system a few different times.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And it just said, No, I'm sorry.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
You just cannot connect to this game ever.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
So fuck Grand Theft Auto.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
All right.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
And you know, still been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto IV.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
All right, there you have it.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto IV, I have to bring this up.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
This is pretty awesome.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I got to rub this in.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
While I was in Hawaii, I got Grand Theft Auto IV for 30 bucks on the Xbox 360.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
And I got Metal Gear Solid IV for $20 for the PlayStation 3.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Both new and wrapped.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
It's like getting them for $5 in Hawaii.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Kind of.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Really cheap.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Kind of.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Radio Shack, apparently, I had forgotten that they got into the market of selling games.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
But then like when I saw that they were clearing them out,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
because I guess I hadn't been performing very well,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I suddenly remembered, Oh yeah, I think we reported that on the show once,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
is that Radio Shack was selling games.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
And not anymore.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
You know, actually I was going to say that Best Buy was clearing out some games as well.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
They had Ninja Gaiden 2 for 10 bucks.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
For the 360.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Nice.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I wouldn't buy it because I don't have a 360.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
You should get one one of these days.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
You really should.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Are you still on your anti-Microsoft thing?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I thought you finally caved and you were going to get one.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm not anti-Microsoft.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm just anti-Xbox because it's a piece of crap system.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Geez.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
You guys missed it.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Bryce Princess and Loki were getting into it before the show about Nintendo.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Maybe we'll talk about it later.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah, well why don't you just tell them what you said

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
and I won't even need to do anything because, you know.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
It was so asinine that, you know.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
We'll get to it later.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I've got to introduce someone else because she's been sitting there very quiet and patiently

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
which is so unlike her.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Fuck you.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Is that going to be your first words on the show?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yes, it is going to be your first words on the show.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Fuck you.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Alright, she has never been on the show before.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
But this is Miss Victoria, everybody.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Hi guys.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
How are you, Miss Victoria?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
What?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
How are you, Miss Victoria?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
I'm fabulous as always.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
That's why I decided to call you on the show, Miss Victoria.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Okay, you can call me Miss Victoria.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
See, what I'm doing is I'm advertising that you're single and unmarried.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Yes, I'm single and unmarried.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
So, I'm looking, the chat room is going crazy right now for two reasons.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
The earlier, and of course you can always join us in chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
if you want to join us in chat.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
The chat's not working on the laptop, so we can't see it.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Alright, we'll get it working somehow later on.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
But, Loki and I can see it.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
They're there.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
They're freaking out.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
They want pics of Rice Princess.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
So, I'll try to get something on the Twitter because, you know, OMG woman.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
So, I'll try to get, I'll get Rice Princess and Victoria to pose

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
and maybe I'll get them to make out a little bit.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I still have that one jello shot in the refrigerator from New Years.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
Alright, and also they're freaking out because right now in chat,

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
a brand new Orange Lounge, I don't even know the name of my show,

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
a brand new Orange Lounge radio website is being previewed.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
It's been made by our buddy Dekeman and he's posted the preview link there in chat

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
and it's amazing.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Like, I am so excited that finally our website that looks old

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
is going to be going away and looking new.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I am so freaking excited.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Do you know why that's why I love our listeners?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Because, it's like, which one is giving them the bigger boner?

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Like, women on the show or the new website layout?

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Like, that's awesome.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Alright, alright, back to Victoria.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
She's never been on the show before.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
We have to interview Victoria a little bit.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
More about me.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
It's all about you, isn't it?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Duh.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Alright, so what kinds of video games do you like?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
What kinds of video games do you play?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Do you play a lot of games?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
It's okay if you don't.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't, unfortunately.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I play Rock Band when I come over to your house

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
and the only video, well, we have a PlayStation 2 at my house

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
and my roommate plays Kingdom Hearts,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
but the only thing I play is on my GameCube

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
and I play Mario Party 7 because that's the only game I have

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
because I stole it from my brother.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Okay, so she knows a little bit about her game.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
She knows what she's talking about.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
So she's got some stuff that she plays.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Kind of.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
But yet you wear a shirt that says,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
right now you're wearing a shirt on it that says nerd.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Yes.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
So you do call yourself a nerd.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
What makes you a nerd if you're not much of a gamer?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm a role player, an online role player.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Get out.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
No, fuck you.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Get the fuck off this show.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Hey, I have talent, okay?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Don't be jealous.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
You just sit in front of a computer and push buttons.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
I actually write, bitch.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Alright.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
What is it that you write, bitch?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Well, I'm a Harry Potter role player.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I'm a big Harry Potter nerd.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I admit it.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm proud of it.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm proud of it.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Okay.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Rob, you need to shut the fuck up,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
because you used to be the vice president of the Star Trek club.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
And what?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Like 15 years ago.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
I know he has such a boner when the movie is going to come out.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
He's going to drag my ass to the midnight premiere.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I can already tell you.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
So what exactly do you mean by cos, or like role playing?

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
Basically, I take on one of the roles of one of the characters in Harry Potter,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
and somebody else takes another role, or they make up their own,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
and we just plot.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm not like, no, no, no, no, no.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
No, no, no, no.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Basically, that's it.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
And we just plot and make our own little storyline.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
It's glorified fan fiction, basically.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Alright.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
So you do other nerdy stuff, too, though.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Like, I know you watch Lost religiously.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
All the time.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh my god, Wednesday.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm so excited.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
And the thing I love about Victoria is she's so animated.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
This is great.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I've got to read some comments from Chat about the whole role play thing.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Chat.orangelandsradio.com.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
We have GS68 says, she puts on a robe and wizard hat.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Fuck you.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I do not.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I do not.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Alright.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
That's only for the premieres.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Are you going to dress up for the next premiere?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I might.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
If it comes down to it, I'll just buy a t-shirt and wear my Harry Potter jacket.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Okay.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
That's alright.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
That's alright.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Really?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
What else was I going to say about you being a nerd?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Oh, you went to Comic Con last year.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I go to Comic Con every year.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I'm from San Diego.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
So I go to Comic Con every year.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I love it.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It's going to be huge this year.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I can already tell you it's the 40th anniversary.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
I haven't bought my tickets yet, but, you know, I should do that soon.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
So what is it you like to see when you're at Comic Con?

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
Before the movie premieres and stuff like that, like last year I went, I saw the panel

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
for The Day the Earth Stood Still, and I saw, I unfortunately went to the Twilight panel,

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
unfortunately, and wanted to kill myself because all the little screaming 12-year-olds were,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
you know, creaming their panties over Robert What's-his-face.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
And, yeah.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
So, I mean, I go for that.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, the movie premiere.

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
I've met so many celebrities because of Comic Con and, you know, met Matthew Fox, who I

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
kind of creamed my panties over.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Well, all right then.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
I was thinking that roleplay is Matthew Fox.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
Suddenly the chatters are lining up to roleplay Matthew Fox in your next Harry Potter thing.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
That's amazing.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay, we've got to take this back to video games at some point, but my buddy Shane, an

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
old friend of the show, Miklotov, is listening, and he's sending me private messages.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Tell Irene and Victoria hi, and they need to make out.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Hi, Shane!

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
All right, we'll have to get the liquor out.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Maybe that'll happen later.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
All right.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
Anyhow, let's actually get back to some gaming here real quick.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh, wait.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
I do want to ask you one other question, though, speaking of video games.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I can't take it back to gaming.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
I love World of Warcraft, as you know, and Rice Princess also dabbles in World of Warcraft

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
once in a while.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
Really funny story.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
She played her boyfriend's account last night and out-DPS'd another character because she

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
didn't even know what she was doing.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
But anyway, you are what we call a WoW Widow.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I was a WoW Widow.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
You were a WoW Widow.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
What is a WoW Widow?

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Basically, I lost my boyfriend to that goddamn game.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
Basically, he would sit in front of his laptop for hours and hours and hours, and we were

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
supposed to be going out, and would basically ignore me, and I'd sit there watching Will

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
and Grace, and he'd be sitting there storming the castle, whatever the fuck you do on that

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
game.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't know.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, so I have a little bit of a grudge against WoW, so I refuse to play it, and every time

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I see Rob playing it, I give him shit.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
And I give Shane shit, too, because, you know, they both get boners every time they're running

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
around in their little princess outfits or whatever the fuck it is they're doing.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Excuse me, excuse me.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Miss Sassy Pants over here.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Excuse me, excuse me.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
They do not have princess outfits in WoW, because if they did, I would be playing all

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
day long.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
All day long.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
I would stop doing Orange Launch Radio.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You know, I have a friend in San Diego.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
One of my gays in San Diego plays WoW just so he can dress his characters up in pretty

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
outfits.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
He told me this.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
He's like, we have, it's a guild of nothing but women, and we dress our characters up

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
in pretty outfits, so.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
There's so many great things to say, but first Victoria has her gays.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Yes.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Yes.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
And there really is just a guild of women that dress up.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
A guild of women and Patrick that just dress up and they run around and like, I don't know

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
what, he says they run around and just, I don't know, do things.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
All right.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Do you know what it was your ex-boyfriend was doing in WoW that took so long?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Was he dressing up in princess outfits?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
So I'm in the castle.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
What is it you do when you play for four hours?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Raiding.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yes, that.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
That.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Okay.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And so, yeah, that's what he would do.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
So when, yeah, I broke up with him, you know, to say the least.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Did you tell him that WoW was the reason you were breaking up with him?

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, it wasn't the main reason, he was a douche, but you know, that had a pretty big

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
influence on why I am no longer with this person.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
All right.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
All right.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Fair enough.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
So I'm sure we'll get into it later if we're talking about Warcraft stories and you hear

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
a big, ah!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Oh hell no!

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
From the corner.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Stop talking about that shit.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
All right.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Let's talk about, because we're getting really into the show here, we got news to get to,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
let's talk about our gaming week.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
So, Loki, you've been awfully quiet through this whole thing.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Welcome back, and how was your gaming week?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
My gaming week was fine.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
Like I said, I've really only been playing, or trying to play, Grand Theft Auto IV.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
Really, I've been seriously trying to get Grand Theft Auto IV PC to work.

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
Because I, there's a lot of cool mods out there now, and it's kind of sad, because I

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
was having fun jumping around with no gravity and stuff, and I wanted to put, like, custom

14:32.000 --> 14:37.700
weapons in that did really crazy shit, like make huge explosions or shoot fire and stuff

14:37.700 --> 14:41.000
like that, and now I can't do that.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.240
And, you know, I mean, there's other sandbox games that have come out on the PC, like Saints

14:46.240 --> 14:49.000
Row 2 just came out, but that sucks on the PC.

14:49.000 --> 14:57.000
Horrible port, which, it's just sad, and Rockstar unfortunately is not doing anything to fix

14:57.000 --> 15:01.400
Grand Theft Auto IV, and to be honest, I've never seen a game where I can reinstall it

15:01.400 --> 15:04.900
and it still doesn't work correctly, except for Crysis.

15:04.900 --> 15:08.700
Crysis also didn't work correctly when I reinstalled it, but that was a whole different way.

15:08.700 --> 15:13.900
I couldn't finish that game because, you know, I would get to the general or whatever and

15:13.900 --> 15:18.500
he'd be standing there like a mannequin and couldn't progress any further because the

15:18.500 --> 15:20.000
event didn't trigger.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.600
Well, that sucked.

15:22.600 --> 15:31.300
Other than that, I think I watched Nellie play more Animal Crossing, because now that

15:31.300 --> 15:32.300
I have that game.

15:32.300 --> 15:33.300
What?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.300
Yeah.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.300
You played some Animal Crossing?

15:35.300 --> 15:36.300
Well, not anymore.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.800
I ruined it for her, apparently, because I cheated.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.300
How'd you, were you time traveling?

15:41.300 --> 15:43.100
No, we did that before.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.900
No, this is actually pure cheating now.

15:46.900 --> 15:53.900
They have devices that you can, you know, hack the memory and stuff and give yourself

15:53.900 --> 16:00.900
all this crazy shit, including the download content, because it's pay for unlock content.

16:00.900 --> 16:08.400
Yeah, the game's really boring because it's just Animal Crossing, you know, but they had

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
some fun codes.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
Okay, let me put it this way.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.900
They had a code where you can go into the characters' houses and you can steal their

16:14.900 --> 16:17.800
furniture, move it around and stuff.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.800
That is pretty awesome.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.800
And you can also do it to the stores, too.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.100
You can just go and pick up stuff.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.300
And see, that was funny because, you know, we had maxed out money and there were some

16:27.300 --> 16:31.300
characters that were pissing us off, so we just trapped them in a corner and surrounded

16:31.300 --> 16:32.300
the furniture around them.

16:32.300 --> 16:36.300
And that was mildly satisfying for a second there.

16:36.300 --> 16:41.900
Yeah, really, what I've been doing with my consoles lately is I've been streaming movies.

16:41.900 --> 16:42.900
That's pretty much what I did.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.900
I actually downloaded a bunch of the Rift Track shorts last night.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.600
We were watching some of those and they're awesome.

16:48.600 --> 16:55.340
But yeah, the PS3 actually works really good as a movie streaming thing, except for Windows

16:55.340 --> 16:56.340
Media files.

16:56.340 --> 16:57.340
I had trouble with that.

16:57.340 --> 17:01.800
I had to actually do that with my 360 for some reason because it just did not want to

17:01.800 --> 17:04.660
work on the PS3.

17:04.660 --> 17:10.020
And then, also, I got the tryout, and I know we have a story on this later, but the new

17:10.020 --> 17:14.620
YouTube that's enhanced now for TVs.

17:14.620 --> 17:16.900
And it's really nice, actually.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.700
Very, very nice looking.

17:18.700 --> 17:21.820
Makes full screen video really easy.

17:21.820 --> 17:28.300
The layout of it's really big so that you can see it on your TV, and it works great.

17:28.300 --> 17:33.020
So definitely something to check out, especially if you're just browsing YouTube stuff or you

17:33.020 --> 17:38.620
want to show your friends something, as happened with showing them the new shorts that they

17:38.620 --> 17:46.820
did for YouTube Live for Charlie and the Unicorn, or Charlie and the Unicorn.

17:46.820 --> 17:49.220
But yeah, that's all that's pretty much going on.

17:49.220 --> 17:54.380
This week, though, and hopefully I'll have more to talk about next week, I'm actually

17:54.380 --> 18:01.060
getting a preview of the new DJ game coming out, Scratch.

18:01.060 --> 18:04.300
They're going to actually show us everything, and they're bringing me a turntable I get

18:04.300 --> 18:07.300
to keep, so that's pretty cool.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.580
That's the one that Newark's actually doing the turntable for.

18:10.580 --> 18:15.260
And the only thing I don't like about it, though, is it's all urban and hip-hop music,

18:15.260 --> 18:19.780
but it makes sense in that game because there's not a lot of scratching in techno music, so

18:19.780 --> 18:20.780
I mean...

18:20.780 --> 18:25.300
Yeah, I was going to say, that's kind of the music that is produced by turntables.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.900
I just wish there was some more house music, and maybe there is, but I'll find out more

18:28.900 --> 18:32.400
this week, I get to see it on Thursday, so I'm pretty psyched about that.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.060
So definitely tune back in next week for Loki's review.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.060
Yes.

18:36.060 --> 18:37.060
Sweet.

18:37.060 --> 18:38.060
Sweet.

18:38.060 --> 18:39.980
Alright, Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

18:39.980 --> 18:41.440
Victoria grabbed your boob.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.500
I know, I just didn't want to acknowledge it on air, but thank you for doing that.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.340
Glad I would.

18:46.340 --> 18:50.980
I totally downloaded Samurai Shodown 2 on Virtual Console, and I was having good times

18:50.980 --> 18:54.940
with that, because that was one of my original fighting games that I loved to play all the

18:54.940 --> 18:55.940
time.

18:55.940 --> 18:57.660
So I was playing that for a while.

18:57.660 --> 18:58.660
Who's your character?

18:58.660 --> 19:00.660
Galford, because he has a dog.

19:00.660 --> 19:06.140
That's the only reason I ever played it, because Galford was on there, and he was hot.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.140
What else?

19:07.140 --> 19:08.140
PopCap games.

19:08.140 --> 19:13.220
Oh, I got Silent Hill Origins for Christmas, kind of late, you know, because it came out.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.220
On the PlayStation 2?

19:14.220 --> 19:15.220
Yeah.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.220
Oh!

19:16.220 --> 19:17.220
How is it?

19:17.220 --> 19:19.500
It's not the best Silent Hill.

19:19.500 --> 19:26.500
It's not bad, but it's different, yeah, because it was made by some European team, but it's

19:26.500 --> 19:27.500
not bad.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.940
Did you ever play Silent Hill 5?

19:29.940 --> 19:30.940
No?

19:30.940 --> 19:32.300
I want to, but no.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.420
Technically it's Silent Hill Homecoming, but whatever.

19:35.420 --> 19:36.420
Homecoming 5.

19:36.420 --> 19:40.860
Isn't it only on the- Silent Hill The Room, you know, that's 4, whatever, I don't give

19:40.860 --> 19:41.860
a crap.

19:41.860 --> 19:43.380
Yeah, isn't it on the Xbox?

19:43.380 --> 19:44.380
360 and PS3.

19:44.380 --> 19:45.380
PS3, yeah.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.380
I don't have any of those.

19:46.380 --> 19:48.780
Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting.

19:48.780 --> 19:49.780
You're stubborn.

19:49.780 --> 19:50.780
But you have friends.

19:50.780 --> 19:51.780
Yeah, you know me.

19:51.780 --> 19:52.780
Yeah.

19:52.780 --> 19:57.660
Do I have to come over here and play, because I am so fucking lazy, I'm not going to drive

19:57.660 --> 19:58.660
here.

19:58.660 --> 20:02.820
Like, I love Silent Hill, but I also love not driving places, so.

20:02.820 --> 20:03.820
Alright.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.020
One of these days, I'm sure.

20:06.020 --> 20:08.780
Maybe I'll pull a Victoria and, like, stay the weekend at your house.

20:08.780 --> 20:12.180
Can we tell that story real quick, can we, can we, the reason why Victoria's here on

20:12.180 --> 20:13.180
the show tonight?

20:13.180 --> 20:15.900
Victoria, why don't you tell our listeners why you're here on the program tonight?

20:15.900 --> 20:20.900
So I'm kind of dumb, and I just, I'm opening a hotel right now, there's a new hotel opening

20:20.900 --> 20:28.040
out in, about, you know, maybe 20 miles from where I live, and so basically we're going

20:28.040 --> 20:31.940
in and out and cleaning all the hotel rooms, big issues, no sawdust, all that shit.

20:31.940 --> 20:37.220
And I'm a genius and lost my keys at work, and so I basically had to search high and

20:37.220 --> 20:41.780
low through all the hotel rooms that I cleaned on Friday.

20:41.780 --> 20:47.820
Yeah, and my roommate isn't home because she's in Sonoma seeing her boyfriend, so she's not

20:47.820 --> 20:51.580
going to be home until tomorrow, so I'm basically stuck at Rob's house until tomorrow, imposing

20:51.580 --> 20:56.040
on his good hospitality and all that, all that nonsense, and I'm very grateful to him

20:56.040 --> 20:57.500
for letting me stay here.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.500
That's right, bitch.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.500
You better, you better gush.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.380
If not, I'd be sleeping in my car.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.780
Tell listeners about how wonderful I am.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.620
Oh yeah, he's so good to me.

21:04.620 --> 21:08.620
Alright, anyway, I just thought that was my story.

21:08.620 --> 21:12.060
I was going to say, there was one game I did forget about that I actually played this week,

21:12.060 --> 21:13.060
Ninja Blade.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.980
I played the demo for that, which is pretty cool.

21:15.980 --> 21:20.020
The game, I mean, looks kind of like a rip-off of Ninja Gaiden 2.

21:20.020 --> 21:24.380
It's actually more of a rip-off of Conan or God of War, I mean, the game plays very similar

21:24.380 --> 21:25.380
to that.

21:25.380 --> 21:30.220
You have three different weapons, you know, with varying speed and damage, and it's all

21:30.220 --> 21:35.540
ninja-themed and stuff, but then there's a lot of quick-time event cutscenes that are

21:35.540 --> 21:39.700
in the game, which are pretty cool-looking, just very cinematic and action-packed.

21:39.700 --> 21:45.420
There's one scene where you're actually running down the side of a skyscraper and killing

21:45.420 --> 21:49.380
these dragon-looking monster things, which are pretty awesome.

21:49.380 --> 21:51.700
So it's definitely worth checking out.

21:51.700 --> 21:52.740
It's not crap.

21:52.740 --> 21:56.900
It's definitely not Vampire Reigns, so that'll be a good one to check out.

21:56.900 --> 22:02.060
I think it's coming out the end of March now, but it's one of those secondary From Software

22:02.060 --> 22:04.300
games that Microsoft's publishing.

22:04.300 --> 22:07.420
Good times, good times.

22:07.420 --> 22:11.260
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

22:11.260 --> 22:14.820
So Victoria, you know how you can extend your stay here at Rob's?

22:14.820 --> 22:19.260
Do his laundry, do his dishes, clean his house?

22:19.260 --> 22:24.060
The guy that I was seeing told me to cook for him, but he's all diet-y and stuff.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.260
I wanted to give Loki the presents I got him from Hawaii.

22:26.260 --> 22:27.540
Why didn't you get me?

22:27.540 --> 22:32.100
So I got him an authentic dashboard hula girl doll, because I thought he'd like that.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.460
I got Jamie one too, she'll find out about that next week.

22:34.460 --> 22:37.780
And then I got some, since you like food, I got you some macadamia nut covered toffee,

22:37.780 --> 22:39.220
which is really good.

22:39.220 --> 22:40.420
So eat it.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.420
It's amazing.

22:41.420 --> 22:42.420
I'll give this to Nellie.

22:42.420 --> 22:43.420
Eat it.

22:43.420 --> 22:44.420
Nellie will like it too.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.540
Yes.

22:46.540 --> 22:47.540
So there you go.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.540
Thank you very much.

22:48.540 --> 22:49.540
All right.

22:49.540 --> 22:50.540
Sorry about that.

22:50.540 --> 22:51.540
I just remembered that.

22:51.540 --> 22:53.460
So you were, what, you were done with your gaming week too then?

22:53.460 --> 22:54.460
Rice Princess?

22:54.460 --> 22:55.460
What else?

22:55.460 --> 22:59.120
Victoria, I don't know if there's been anything you've been playing, but why don't you share?

22:59.120 --> 23:00.820
I played rock band with Rob yesterday.

23:00.820 --> 23:01.820
Oh yeah.

23:01.820 --> 23:05.100
We made a band, the Shrieking Beavers.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.100
Yeah.

23:06.100 --> 23:07.100
Yeah.

23:07.100 --> 23:10.940
And then I have a game on my phone that I've been playing, but that's as, you know, awesome

23:10.940 --> 23:12.340
as it gets.

23:12.340 --> 23:13.340
What game on your phone?

23:13.340 --> 23:14.340
It's called Pump Jack.

23:14.340 --> 23:15.340
It's like a little, you're like a little-

23:15.340 --> 23:16.340
It sounds dirty.

23:16.340 --> 23:17.340
I know, right?

23:17.340 --> 23:18.340
I know, right?

23:18.340 --> 23:19.340
Wow.

23:19.340 --> 23:20.340
No, it came with my sidekick.

23:20.340 --> 23:24.140
So like, it's like your little wheel and you have to go collect all the gas cans and you

23:24.140 --> 23:27.500
have to avoid the little cactuses that can explode and kill you.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.500
And then you Pump Jack.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.500
Pump Jack.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.500
Yeah.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.700
No, and I've been playing it for like, I've been playing it since I got my damn phone,

23:33.700 --> 23:36.060
which is almost a year, and I still haven't beaten it.

23:36.060 --> 23:38.980
I'm on like the last level and it's driving me crazy that I can't win.

23:38.980 --> 23:42.020
Which goes to show you why I don't play video games, because I get frustrated and then I

23:42.020 --> 23:44.140
just don't want to play anymore.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.140
So.

23:45.140 --> 23:47.660
Well, we have an interesting story later on that might appeal to you.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.660
I'll talk about that.

23:48.660 --> 23:49.660
Bring it.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.100
Like what they're doing for frustrated people like you.

23:51.100 --> 23:52.260
Fabulous.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.260
My gaming week.

23:53.260 --> 23:54.340
I haven't played a lot of new things.

23:54.340 --> 23:56.660
I've kind of recycled a lot of the older games I have.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.500
Like of course I've been playing WoW.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.660
I've been playing a lot of little big-

23:59.660 --> 24:00.660
Shut up.

24:00.660 --> 24:03.140
I've been playing a lot of little big planet.

24:03.140 --> 24:06.340
I don't remember if I ever talked about it on the show, but I was playing Suikoden, the

24:06.340 --> 24:08.220
old school one for PlayStation 1.

24:08.220 --> 24:09.220
Like I was playing that like crazy.

24:09.220 --> 24:12.500
I haven't really touched it since I got back from Hawaii, because I got to a part of the

24:12.500 --> 24:13.700
game where it actually got hard again.

24:13.700 --> 24:17.780
So I'm getting to the Victoria level of frustration with it, but I'll go back and try to beat

24:17.780 --> 24:19.660
it at some point.

24:19.660 --> 24:21.660
And then as far as new stuff I've been playing.

24:21.660 --> 24:24.940
The new stuff I've been playing is on the iPhone, which is kind of interesting.

24:24.940 --> 24:27.060
Konami put out some interesting games this week.

24:27.060 --> 24:35.280
They put out a demo for Dance Dance Revolution, the new iPhone DDR game, which is interesting.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.540
Its biggest problem is like it's choppy.

24:37.540 --> 24:41.700
Like seriously, if you think that Xbox frame rate thing is an issue, try playing DDR on

24:41.700 --> 24:42.700
your iPhone.

24:42.700 --> 24:43.700
It's pretty horrible.

24:43.700 --> 24:44.700
But it's very pretty.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.700
Like for a cell phone game, it's actually very pretty looking and the sounds very good

24:47.700 --> 24:50.000
because obviously iPhones or iPods.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.900
So the music is obviously full quality, which is kind of nice.

24:53.900 --> 24:57.180
And basically what it is, a little dance pad shows up at the bottom of your screen and

24:57.180 --> 24:58.180
you play with your fingers.

24:58.180 --> 25:02.860
You dance with your fingers to the music, which is, you know, cute, but I don't know

25:02.860 --> 25:03.860
how.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.180
I mean, luckily it's free.

25:05.180 --> 25:06.180
It's free.

25:06.180 --> 25:07.180
So you can't complain.

25:07.180 --> 25:08.180
Totally free.

25:08.180 --> 25:09.620
But it's just the one song for free.

25:09.620 --> 25:10.980
So just one song.

25:10.980 --> 25:11.980
Yeah.

25:11.980 --> 25:12.980
It's one song.

25:12.980 --> 25:13.980
Wow.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.700
But it's like a preview of what they're working on or something.

25:16.700 --> 25:17.700
All right.

25:17.700 --> 25:20.420
The other game I got on the iPhone is Silent Hill.

25:20.420 --> 25:22.260
They actually have on the iPhone now.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.940
It's a new version of it.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.100
I think it's called Silent Hill, the revenge.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.180
I can't remember the name of it.

25:29.180 --> 25:31.400
I'm actually looking it up on my phone right now.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.060
It's called, let me see, I'm learning it right now.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.500
Basically in this game, you have these little mini mazes.

25:37.500 --> 25:43.100
It looks like the old school dungeon explorer game from the Turbo Graphics 16, the escape.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.100
That's what it's called.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.100
Silent Hill, the escape.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.780
Let me see if I can get some of the music for you guys.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.660
Your fingers and you just hit the buttons and like, that's how you play it and there's

25:51.660 --> 25:56.700
only one level.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.740
I have no idea if they can hear that over the air, but a little bit of what it sounds

25:59.740 --> 26:00.740
like.

26:00.740 --> 26:02.160
No, you actually, it uses the touch screen.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.760
It's a whole new interface that uses the touch screen.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.340
You can slide back and forth to move through the maze and you turn left and right.

26:07.340 --> 26:11.260
And then to fire your gun, you tap on the crosshair to fire the gun.

26:11.260 --> 26:13.700
And the crosshair is all tilt sensitive.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.760
So if you want to aim up and down, you tilt.

26:15.760 --> 26:21.500
So you will run across these nurses in the maze and you can blow their brains out basically.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.900
It's not really a Silent Hill game.

26:23.900 --> 26:29.300
It's basically a dungeon crawling game that they've slapped Silent Hill graphics onto.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.740
Surely you just, Rob.

26:30.740 --> 26:33.620
Well, Silent Hill is all about avoiding things.

26:33.620 --> 26:36.760
You don't necessarily have to shoot everything in the face, you know what I mean?

26:36.760 --> 26:38.380
But this game kind of encourages that.

26:38.380 --> 26:39.380
Thanks, Rob.

26:39.380 --> 26:40.380
I do encourage people.

26:40.380 --> 26:41.380
I appreciate you explaining it to me.

26:41.380 --> 26:42.380
Shut up.

26:42.380 --> 26:44.660
But I'm telling you, for the listeners, you know what I mean?

26:44.660 --> 26:45.660
I know, I know.

26:45.660 --> 26:46.660
I don't know what it's about.

26:46.660 --> 26:47.660
I've seen the movie.

26:47.660 --> 26:48.660
And you didn't like the movie, did you?

26:48.660 --> 26:49.660
I was pissed at the end.

26:49.660 --> 26:50.660
I was like, what the fuck is this?

26:50.660 --> 26:56.900
But it's more one of those things that's much better if you've played the game.

26:56.900 --> 27:02.180
So yeah, Silent Hill on the iPhone is kind of, eh, I mean, it's only $8.

27:02.180 --> 27:03.940
You can be honest.

27:03.940 --> 27:04.940
You know what?

27:04.940 --> 27:05.940
Here's the thing.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.680
It's actually a really smooth running game.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.620
The controls are kind of interesting.

27:09.620 --> 27:12.660
The way you play, no, compared to DDR, like the frame rate is much better.

27:12.660 --> 27:13.980
It runs a lot smoothly.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.620
For a mobile phone game, the graphics are actually pretty good.

27:17.620 --> 27:21.900
And if you play with headphones, the sound and stuff is actually kind of neat.

27:21.900 --> 27:25.400
So it's actually not a bad game.

27:25.400 --> 27:29.180
It's just kind of short and not really Silent Hill.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.180
That's the thing.

27:30.180 --> 27:36.260
So, I mean, if you want to get kind of an interesting maze exploring game that you shoot

27:36.260 --> 27:38.540
things in, get this game.

27:38.540 --> 27:41.780
Or if you want like a, you know, just, it's a cute little time waster.

27:41.780 --> 27:45.980
I mean, there's only like six levels, so I don't know if it's necessarily worth $8.

27:45.980 --> 27:51.420
I think maybe $5 would have been a better price point for this, but you know, whatever,

27:51.420 --> 27:52.420
I guess.

27:52.420 --> 27:53.420
That's just, yeah.

27:53.420 --> 27:58.620
When I think of Silent Hill, I totally think of shooting my way out of a maze.

27:58.620 --> 28:02.260
They had to come up with like, they try, you know, they have these little story elements

28:02.260 --> 28:04.020
that are in it too, although not much.

28:04.020 --> 28:06.940
I haven't seen Pyramid Head yet, but I might not have just played far enough.

28:06.940 --> 28:09.060
I mean, it's, it's, it's all right.

28:09.060 --> 28:11.620
It's you have to remember it's a mobile phone game.

28:11.620 --> 28:14.180
If your expectations are high, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment.

28:14.180 --> 28:15.180
I know.

28:15.180 --> 28:19.300
Or they just make it a generic game or something like it's nothing like Silent Hill.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.300
Well, it is.

28:20.300 --> 28:26.140
Cause then it wouldn't get sold if they didn't put Silent Hill on it.

28:26.140 --> 28:27.700
That's pretty much it right there.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.620
But what's interesting about this is that, hey, there's a Metal Gear game coming out

28:30.620 --> 28:32.980
and a lot of people are like, OMG, Metal Gear on the phone.

28:32.980 --> 28:35.020
Well, if it's anything like this, don't get your hopes up.

28:35.020 --> 28:36.700
It is exactly, actually it's worse than that.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.300
It's a real shooter.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.220
Then it's not even going to be anything.

28:40.220 --> 28:44.100
And then a pad comes up and you just use your fingers to hit the buttons and it's only one

28:44.100 --> 28:45.100
song.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.100
Yeah.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.100
Yeah.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.100
There you go.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.100
Womp, womp, womp.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.100
All right.

28:50.100 --> 28:51.100
So there it is.

28:51.100 --> 28:53.460
That, that was my quick review on the Silent Hill, the escape, the iPhone game.

28:53.460 --> 28:57.060
Uh, otherwise I don't think I've really been playing a lot of new stuff.

28:57.060 --> 29:02.780
Um, you know, just playing the same old stuff on, well, there's console games too.

29:02.780 --> 29:05.660
Yes, I played Violet hold with you.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.660
I'm the best warrior.

29:06.660 --> 29:07.660
There you go.

29:07.660 --> 29:08.660
All right.

29:08.660 --> 29:11.820
Let's, uh, let's start to get into some gaming news tonight, but first I just want to say

29:11.820 --> 29:13.780
a couple quick housekeeping announcements.

29:13.780 --> 29:15.740
Really dark soccer is not here tonight.

29:15.740 --> 29:20.220
Um, which, you know, is probably pretty obvious cause the show is completely getting off base.

29:20.220 --> 29:24.220
Uh, cause you know, when, when Jamie's not here to keep us in line, uh, the show just

29:24.220 --> 29:25.220
goes crazy.

29:25.220 --> 29:26.580
Uh, so she's not here tonight.

29:26.580 --> 29:30.460
We will still have a classic game of the week tonight, um, that I believe I'm doing or did

29:30.460 --> 29:34.300
the Deloki find something he's doing, uh, we'll figure it out.

29:34.300 --> 29:39.620
Uh, so we'll do that in a little later on and, uh, she'll be back next week and, uh,

29:39.620 --> 29:43.180
we apparently also in housekeeping tonight, we have a brand new orange launch radio website

29:43.180 --> 29:44.180
coming soon.

29:44.180 --> 29:47.160
It looks like, cause the beta looks great.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.680
And if you're in chat right now, just ask a deep man.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.480
He did a awesome.

29:51.480 --> 29:52.480
He did.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.140
It doesn't look like it was made in the early two thousands.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.140
It doesn't.

29:55.140 --> 29:57.020
It looks, it looks very modern.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.020
It's still simple though.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.020
Is what I like about it.

29:59.020 --> 30:02.460
He didn't, he didn't load it up with like a bunch of crap.

30:02.460 --> 30:05.740
It still looks efficient, which would be cool.

30:05.740 --> 30:07.620
So I'm, I'm very excited.

30:07.620 --> 30:12.020
So big thank you to deep man and we'll find other ways to thank him later on when the

30:12.020 --> 30:13.140
site goes live.

30:13.140 --> 30:17.540
People will send, we'll send, uh, we'll send Victoria out there to babysit cause he's married.

30:17.540 --> 30:22.620
So Victoria can go babysit.

30:22.620 --> 30:26.500
I have a 10 year old brother and I want to kill him every time I see him, I can't stand

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
children.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.860
No, I don't, I don't hurt him.

30:29.860 --> 30:32.980
I just, you know, kind of pulls, I kind of pull his hair a little bit and smack him in

30:32.980 --> 30:36.180
the head and tell him to quit looking like a little girl with his John Lennon hair.

30:36.180 --> 30:41.140
But you know, doesn't your 10, doesn't your 10 year old brother play grand theft auto?

30:41.140 --> 30:45.980
Yeah, he does, he called me on Christmas day asking me to find him cheat codes for grand

30:45.980 --> 30:49.460
theft auto four and I said, God damn it, you have the fucking internet.

30:49.460 --> 30:52.060
Look it up yourself to your 10 year old brother.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.060
He knows I love him.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.180
He shouldn't be playing grand theft auto four anyway.

30:56.180 --> 30:59.900
I was playing grand theft auto since he was like six.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.380
My dad thought it was appropriate to buy him GTA three when he was six.

31:03.380 --> 31:04.380
Okay.

31:04.380 --> 31:05.380
Yeah.

31:05.380 --> 31:08.580
So it's fabulous parenting on my parents' part.

31:08.580 --> 31:09.580
Yes.

31:09.580 --> 31:12.140
And I just wonder how I turned out so normal.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.940
All right.

31:13.940 --> 31:20.100
Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news for the love of God.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.100
Gaming news.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.100
Yes.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.100
Loki, please.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.380
Well, we got to do some stuff from last week first though, right?

31:25.380 --> 31:26.380
Yes.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.380
Okay.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.380
So let's start with last week's news.

31:28.380 --> 31:32.900
Last week we had CES and of course there wasn't a whole lot of game news coming out, but Microsoft

31:32.900 --> 31:35.620
did show off one thing that was kind of neat.

31:35.620 --> 31:41.660
Their brand new community game, um, that's actually kind of a game making program.

31:41.660 --> 31:46.140
Now we talked about this on the program before when it was called Boku.

31:46.140 --> 31:50.980
Now they've decided to change the name to kudo or kodo kodo.

31:50.980 --> 31:55.140
I mean, Boku, kudo, kodo, but who cares?

31:55.140 --> 31:56.140
Okay.

31:56.140 --> 32:02.460
So kodo anyways, it's basically a very simplified game making program.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.100
Um, they're comparing it to a little big planet.

32:05.100 --> 32:10.220
I don't think it's anything like little big planet at all, but, um, it's kind of object

32:10.220 --> 32:15.420
oriented programming stuff and you can use the characters and stuff in there, um, to

32:15.420 --> 32:17.100
basically create your own little games.

32:17.100 --> 32:21.900
They're all kind of pixelated looking cause the blocks in the game are actually very Lego

32:21.900 --> 32:22.900
like.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.700
So it's kind of neat.

32:24.700 --> 32:27.900
Um, so yeah, you can basically make games.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.220
They have 200 building blocks right now.

32:30.220 --> 32:32.260
I'm sure there'll be more available for download.

32:32.260 --> 32:37.940
Uh, no word on when it's coming out, supposedly later this year and, um, you'll be able to,

32:37.940 --> 32:38.940
I guess, make games.

32:38.940 --> 32:45.060
I don't know if it will be available also on, um, their community game service cause

32:45.060 --> 32:49.580
that could be really messy if there's that many community games on there, you know, as

32:49.580 --> 32:54.140
if it was hard enough for some of these community game developers to get their game notice.

32:54.140 --> 32:58.140
They have all these crappy Boku levels.

32:58.140 --> 32:59.140
I don't know.

32:59.140 --> 33:00.580
Or, uh, kodo levels.

33:00.580 --> 33:04.380
Well, yeah, one of these days I want to get, um, Aaron back on the show.

33:04.380 --> 33:07.300
I'm hoping he'll listen at one point, but he's the guy who did snake three 60.

33:07.300 --> 33:10.420
Like I want to talk to him now, like six weeks out after his game has been released and see

33:10.420 --> 33:15.380
how it, I saw him respond back to a, there was an IGN review of his game or something

33:15.380 --> 33:19.300
there really about like the hot or not of like community games.

33:19.300 --> 33:23.100
And his was actually in the not section and the reasons and the reasons that they gave

33:23.100 --> 33:24.100
her retarded.

33:24.100 --> 33:28.640
They're all, Oh, it's snake game and it totally looked like that the guy did not play the

33:28.640 --> 33:29.640
game at all.

33:29.640 --> 33:34.140
So it was, it was retarded, but it was funny cause he's just, you know, called him out

33:34.140 --> 33:35.140
on it.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.700
He's like, um, doesn't sound like you played this at all.

33:37.700 --> 33:41.220
And you actually, there's a lot of features that you didn't mention.

33:41.220 --> 33:45.300
And um, you know, there's some other games that was just like crap that they gave good

33:45.300 --> 33:46.300
reviews for.

33:46.300 --> 33:49.540
But remember it's just one person's review and you know, just because they happen to

33:49.540 --> 33:54.620
be behind a website and you know, their voice unfortunately is a little bit louder than everybody

33:54.620 --> 33:55.620
else's.

33:55.620 --> 34:01.600
Well, there's a lot of voices that got a little quieter last week and this is huge news, huge

34:01.600 --> 34:04.980
news throughout the community, especially, um, you know, on the type of websites.

34:04.980 --> 34:08.620
I think those of you guys that listen to these types of independent podcasts, I'm sure you

34:08.620 --> 34:10.180
guys read a lot of gaming blogs.

34:10.180 --> 34:12.060
You see a lot of this, so it's no news to you guys.

34:12.060 --> 34:18.980
I'm sure that a UGO bought the one up network, uh, this week and uh, basically it caused,

34:18.980 --> 34:24.660
you know, long story short, uh, it caused EGM to go under electronic gaming monthly.

34:24.660 --> 34:30.300
The magazine is no more and uh, lots and lots of folks that were working at one up.com goodbye,

34:30.300 --> 34:36.560
including the people that were doing the one up show and uh, one up was one up yours was

34:36.560 --> 34:37.560
the video show.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.020
I'm going to be honest guys, it's so fun.

34:40.020 --> 34:43.700
Here's the thing, you know, there's not a lot of extra news to talk about with us.

34:43.700 --> 34:47.040
I'm sure you guys all read it in the week we were gone, so you all are probably pretty

34:47.040 --> 34:48.040
familiar with it.

34:48.040 --> 34:52.360
If not, go look on any blog that was running last week and I'm sure you'll read about it.

34:52.360 --> 34:57.100
It's very interesting, like really how much love was out there for these shows and this

34:57.100 --> 35:03.100
site, which was interesting to me because honestly I've never ever watched it or listened

35:03.100 --> 35:04.740
to a show of theirs, but I don't do it.

35:04.740 --> 35:06.540
That's, that's my policy across the board.

35:06.540 --> 35:11.580
There's very, very, very few shows that I listened to because I don't want to inadvertently

35:11.580 --> 35:12.580
steal ideas.

35:12.580 --> 35:13.580
If that makes sense.

35:13.580 --> 35:14.580
Does that make sense?

35:14.580 --> 35:15.580
That makes sense.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.580
You know, we've done a show for like seven years.

35:16.580 --> 35:19.380
I don't want to be accused of ripping something off of somebody else.

35:19.380 --> 35:23.700
And no offense, but that's going to happen anyway, even if I don't watch them.

35:23.700 --> 35:26.980
People are going to say we stole stuff, but whatever.

35:26.980 --> 35:32.140
So and to be honest, I don't even know who UGO is.

35:32.140 --> 35:36.260
I mean, I've never heard of them as a website.

35:36.260 --> 35:40.700
Don't they run a lot of other sites for entertainment, movies, things of that nature.

35:40.700 --> 35:46.460
They're trying to be like a one, not one, an IGN type of service, but I've never visited

35:46.460 --> 35:51.940
them ever and you know, I don't know, I just have never heard of them.

35:51.940 --> 35:57.900
It's, you know, maybe that's my own ignorance, but I've never heard of them at all and the

35:57.900 --> 36:03.300
fact that they're teaming up with 1UP now or they bought them out means nothing to me

36:03.300 --> 36:10.100
because I haven't visited 1UP in months and I just don't, same with GameSpot.

36:10.100 --> 36:11.900
It's just done with it.

36:11.900 --> 36:15.020
Well, here's what's interesting is that my comment on this, the first thing I was thinking

36:15.020 --> 36:19.780
of because I read about this when I was out in Hawaii and I was kind of my first thought

36:19.780 --> 36:21.980
was, okay, we're going to have to talk about this on the show at some point.

36:21.980 --> 36:26.940
My kind of thought on this is this will be a chance to see how much these guys that were

36:26.940 --> 36:32.460
producing these shows and doing this stuff were really into video games and really into

36:32.460 --> 36:38.900
their craft because as many independent podcasts have shown for years and years and years,

36:38.900 --> 36:43.000
you don't have to get paid to do this stuff if you really, really enjoy it.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.020
So my kind of thing was I was going to say, well guys, here you go, here's your chance

36:47.020 --> 36:51.560
to keep doing what you do just because this may not be the day job anymore.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.440
You can still keep it going and they have.

36:54.440 --> 36:59.700
So props to them because now there is the whole Rebel FM I think it's called and I think

36:59.700 --> 37:01.940
there's another one called Geek Box.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.680
So props to them for continuing to do it.

37:04.680 --> 37:09.040
So I'm kind of curious to see how much this is going to go and kind of where some of these

37:09.040 --> 37:10.040
guys end up.

37:10.040 --> 37:13.460
If this is the same thing that's going to happen, remember, that's how we got This Week

37:13.460 --> 37:14.460
in Tech.

37:14.460 --> 37:15.460
True.

37:15.460 --> 37:22.460
I mean, you know, follow up from Tech TV, so, I don't know, and I'm sure that they'll

37:22.460 --> 37:28.940
make it just as well and probably even better now that they're away from 1UP, so.

37:28.940 --> 37:30.180
Why do you say that?

37:30.180 --> 37:33.620
Just because, like look at This Week in Tech, I think they're doing very well and I think

37:33.620 --> 37:38.940
that if they were still part of G4, you know, the whole Tech TV thing, I think they wouldn't

37:38.940 --> 37:42.260
be doing as well as they are now, independently.

37:42.260 --> 37:47.020
Less influence from other things that are more corporate oriented.

37:47.020 --> 37:48.020
Interesting.

37:48.020 --> 37:49.660
Well, good luck.

37:49.660 --> 37:55.620
I mean, it's never fun to talk about job layoffs, but good luck to those folks and good luck

37:55.620 --> 37:57.140
to 1UP, too.

37:57.140 --> 38:02.060
Stand kind of on top of things now because they've been, of course, they've taken a lot

38:02.060 --> 38:04.780
of negative press over this whole thing, so I don't know.

38:04.780 --> 38:09.380
I got to ask you, Rice Princess, because you were on 1UP for quite some time, like years

38:09.380 --> 38:12.500
ago when I was posting on there and participating on the site, you were kind of the one that

38:12.500 --> 38:15.580
got me into that and I think you kind of hung out there for a little while after that.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.540
What do you think about all this news about it closing?

38:17.540 --> 38:21.900
Is 1UP a site you would still visit or are you like, eh, the people are gone, whatever?

38:21.900 --> 38:27.220
It's interesting because, yeah, I actually did revisit my 1UP account like a couple weeks

38:27.220 --> 38:31.500
ago, actually, before any of this ever happened and I still have the same friends and stuff.

38:31.500 --> 38:36.940
I didn't really do anything, but I mean, it's always sad when a community, a group of people

38:36.940 --> 38:40.300
just, you know, can't meet at the same place anymore.

38:40.300 --> 38:44.180
It's like having your favorite local coffee shop or something close down.

38:44.180 --> 38:45.180
It's just like, oh, that sucks.

38:45.180 --> 38:46.180
But, you know.

38:46.180 --> 38:47.180
You just moved to a new coffee shop.

38:47.180 --> 38:48.180
I know.

38:48.180 --> 38:49.180
That's what I'm saying.

38:49.180 --> 38:51.820
People can, you know, get each other's information, go to another place and do it.

38:51.820 --> 38:56.140
But, you know, you can go to another coffee shop, but it might not be as cool or as quirky

38:56.140 --> 38:57.140
or whatever.

38:57.140 --> 39:03.660
Now, you know, the thing is, in defense, I guess you would say to, you know, UGO, you

39:03.660 --> 39:09.380
know, print gaming press, I think it's going to be gone in a few years anyways.

39:09.380 --> 39:14.600
It's just that they can't really compete unless you're like, you know, Game Informer or something

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
like that.

39:15.600 --> 39:19.980
And you're, you know, cutting deals with these publishers to have the exclusive story and

39:19.980 --> 39:20.980
stuff.

39:20.980 --> 39:25.260
But even still, people know now not to even bother reading that because they can just

39:25.260 --> 39:28.460
read that same story on the internet when someone gets their copy of the magazine, relays

39:28.460 --> 39:31.380
what's in there, as well as all the media that was on there.

39:31.380 --> 39:37.380
It's just the internet's so instantaneous now that print press is just becoming kind

39:37.380 --> 39:38.380
of dated.

39:38.380 --> 39:39.380
Yeah.

39:39.380 --> 39:43.060
The electronic gaming monthly news is especially sad because, you know, I think a lot of us

39:43.060 --> 39:45.460
remember that magazine from years and years ago.

39:45.460 --> 39:46.460
I grew up.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.460
Yeah.

39:47.460 --> 39:48.460
Don't get me wrong.

39:48.460 --> 39:52.220
It was like the best gaming magazine out there years ago when the internet didn't exist.

39:52.220 --> 39:53.220
Yeah.

39:53.220 --> 39:56.380
But here's the thing is that I know a lot of people are really sad about EGM going away

39:56.380 --> 39:57.740
and to me to an extent too.

39:57.740 --> 39:58.740
Am I sad?

39:58.740 --> 39:59.740
Yes.

39:59.740 --> 40:00.740
Am I surprised?

40:00.740 --> 40:01.740
Not really.

40:01.740 --> 40:02.740
But here's the thing.

40:02.740 --> 40:05.740
That magazine has been dead to me for 10 years.

40:05.740 --> 40:10.260
Like I, I remember that magazine like back in the day, you know, like, Oh my God, that

40:10.260 --> 40:15.380
issue where they actually had the, um, Shang Long lie in it for the April Fools.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.580
I fricking had that issue with the magazine.

40:17.580 --> 40:18.580
I remember that.

40:18.580 --> 40:19.580
Yeah.

40:19.580 --> 40:22.980
Like I remember some of that stuff happening, but honestly, like I stopped.

40:22.980 --> 40:25.140
I stopped subscribing to that a long time ago.

40:25.140 --> 40:26.620
A lot of people did.

40:26.620 --> 40:30.540
So for me it was more of the news of, uh, Oh, well, you know, that's too bad.

40:30.540 --> 40:34.860
That's an icon of my youth that's going away, but I'm not surprised.

40:34.860 --> 40:35.860
Yeah.

40:35.860 --> 40:42.000
I mean, with the advent of, you know, internet news outlets and especially blogs, blogs are

40:42.000 --> 40:46.520
becoming more popular than, you know, normal media sites because people like to identify

40:46.520 --> 40:51.220
with other people who are on their level, who are normal, who can give, you know, a

40:51.220 --> 40:53.980
perspective, you know, that's not like corporate.

40:53.980 --> 40:57.660
And a big purpose for magazines now in this day and age is to read when you're on the

40:57.660 --> 41:01.860
toilet, but now that they have iPhones, you can look at blogs when you're on the toilet

41:01.860 --> 41:02.860
now.

41:02.860 --> 41:03.860
You can.

41:03.860 --> 41:04.860
Yes.

41:04.860 --> 41:05.860
Yeah.

41:05.860 --> 41:06.860
Just don't.

41:06.860 --> 41:07.860
That's what I do.

41:07.860 --> 41:08.860
So you don't, I don't even need magazines anymore.

41:08.860 --> 41:11.060
I can look at websites.

41:11.060 --> 41:12.060
Only a wow.

41:12.060 --> 41:13.060
What Victoria?

41:13.060 --> 41:14.060
What you want?

41:14.060 --> 41:15.060
Nasty ho.

41:15.060 --> 41:16.060
Okay.

41:16.060 --> 41:17.060
We don't want to know what you're doing.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.060
You're taking a dump.

41:18.060 --> 41:22.900
Look, everybody poops, haven't you ever read that book?

41:22.900 --> 41:25.180
Everybody poops.

41:25.180 --> 41:29.540
If you wipe your butt and you get a little bit of poop on your finger and you put it

41:29.540 --> 41:33.420
on your thing, you can't throw it away like a magazine.

41:33.420 --> 41:34.420
Stop it.

41:34.420 --> 41:36.940
I'm down with the old school magazines being in my bathroom.

41:36.940 --> 41:37.940
You know that.

41:37.940 --> 41:42.180
You see all the maxims lined up like on my toilet.

41:42.180 --> 41:44.120
We can move away from that now.

41:44.120 --> 41:47.980
But what I'm talking about is, is that, you know, people used to have the magazines or

41:47.980 --> 41:52.380
the, what was it, the bathroom reader books or whatever, but now we can have the internet

41:52.380 --> 41:54.700
even when we're pooping.

41:54.700 --> 41:55.700
We could.

41:55.700 --> 41:58.220
So we can look at blogs and all that there.

41:58.220 --> 42:00.100
I guess you're right about that.

42:00.100 --> 42:03.100
It's gross, but yeah.

42:03.100 --> 42:08.860
So magazine, I'm just saying magazines are, are, it's one last use is going away.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.340
Oh, I'm holding your laptop right now.

42:11.340 --> 42:13.140
You've had this in the bathroom with you.

42:13.140 --> 42:14.140
Haven't you?

42:14.140 --> 42:15.140
Oh yeah.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.140
There's poop somewhere on here, isn't there?

42:17.140 --> 42:18.140
Oh, damn it.

42:18.140 --> 42:21.860
Why are the keys so sticky, Rob?

42:21.860 --> 42:22.860
You're disgusting.

42:22.860 --> 42:24.740
Somebody burned my hands off.

42:24.740 --> 42:26.380
All right, please.

42:26.380 --> 42:27.380
Let's move on.

42:27.380 --> 42:28.380
For God's sake.

42:28.380 --> 42:29.380
All right.

42:29.380 --> 42:33.060
Well, there's a rumor coming from IGN.

42:33.060 --> 42:39.620
They have multiple sources close to Nintendo that have told the site that, um, the TSI

42:39.620 --> 42:47.300
will be out in the US on April 4th at $179.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.540
I somehow don't believe this.

42:49.540 --> 42:50.940
And why is that that you don't believe this?

42:50.940 --> 42:54.140
Well, there's just a few things that strike me as weird.

42:54.140 --> 42:59.780
Nintendo for some reason likes releasing their stuff, especially hardware, on Sundays, and

42:59.780 --> 43:02.220
the 4th is actually a Saturday.

43:02.220 --> 43:03.220
For one.

43:03.220 --> 43:06.820
Actually, that's my only thing, is that it's a Saturday, not a Sunday.

43:06.820 --> 43:08.460
Therefore I am calling the whole thing book.

43:08.460 --> 43:12.900
I don't know, it doesn't really matter, and I think if anything, they would want to hold

43:12.900 --> 43:20.620
off on selling the DSi, because they've been selling tons of DS's already, and I think

43:20.620 --> 43:25.180
if they bring the DSi out, it's just going to cut into their DS sales.

43:25.180 --> 43:31.060
And they're not really having trouble selling DS systems, and I don't know, there's not

43:31.060 --> 43:36.820
really any DSi software out, even in Japan right now, other than the download stuff,

43:36.820 --> 43:39.860
but I guess, I don't know.

43:39.860 --> 43:43.180
Of course, they could always just cut the price of the DS that's out there right now

43:43.180 --> 43:45.260
by like 20 bucks and release the DSi.

43:45.260 --> 43:50.700
For $99.99, yeah, then people will start making love to DS's like crazy or something.

43:50.700 --> 43:54.900
Exactly, and then they'll sell both, because you'll have the more high priced ones for

43:54.900 --> 43:57.380
folks that want the camera and all that stuff.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.380
They could do it.

43:58.380 --> 44:01.420
But yeah, what Loki says about the date is especially interesting, because Nintendo does

44:01.420 --> 44:02.420
usually do a Sunday.

44:02.420 --> 44:06.420
I wonder if it doesn't mean maybe shipping on April 4th to store on April 5th?

44:06.420 --> 44:09.820
No, you can't have a ship date on Saturday, it wouldn't make any sense, because no one

44:09.820 --> 44:11.580
ships on Saturdays.

44:11.580 --> 44:13.680
They would street it for a Sunday.

44:13.680 --> 44:18.540
So okay, whatever, maybe it's April 5th, I mean, big deal.

44:18.540 --> 44:20.420
I don't know, I think it's just a big rumor right now.

44:20.420 --> 44:26.540
I think if anything, they'll announce something later, I don't know, it doesn't really seem

44:26.540 --> 44:31.820
like there'd be any reason to release this now, I mean, there's just a few download games

44:31.820 --> 44:32.820
and that's it.

44:32.820 --> 44:35.220
It's just not really that worthwhile.

44:35.220 --> 44:41.660
I don't know if the DS was kind of tanking a little bit, not really tanking, but if sales

44:41.660 --> 44:45.720
are starting to drop off a little bit in Japan, and maybe that's why they released the DSi,

44:45.720 --> 44:50.940
but I don't think they're dropping off at all, I mean, we're still selling tons of DS

44:50.940 --> 44:53.300
systems, not having a problem whatsoever.

44:53.300 --> 44:57.080
Some comments from chatroom on this story, Cy says, I think their strategy is that Nintendo

44:57.080 --> 45:02.820
fans will buy the 179DSi and most people will buy the DS Lite at regular, kind of similar

45:02.820 --> 45:03.820
to what I was saying.

45:03.820 --> 45:07.780
Yeah, so the DSi is for hardcore gamers, yeah, uh-huh, sure.

45:07.780 --> 45:10.860
Or people who want the extra garbage that it's gonna have.

45:10.860 --> 45:13.180
Xlink says, and you can take it to the bathroom.

45:13.180 --> 45:16.180
You can indeed play your DS in the bathroom, and I'm sure there's people that do that.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.980
Yeah, and it has a really crappy, you know, jump browser.

45:18.980 --> 45:19.980
No pun intended.

45:19.980 --> 45:24.500
Yeah, it has a horrible web browser built into it as well, so.

45:24.500 --> 45:29.460
Bobby says, Activision Blizzard doesn't want the DSi released because their best-selling

45:29.460 --> 45:31.060
DS game won't be compatible.

45:31.060 --> 45:33.100
Guitar Hero on tour.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.100
Yes.

45:34.100 --> 45:37.340
Well, Activision Blizzard don't have a say in it, so...

45:37.340 --> 45:38.340
Poop on them.

45:38.340 --> 45:39.340
I don't know.

45:39.340 --> 45:40.340
It's just...

45:40.340 --> 45:41.340
This show is really poop-filled.

45:41.340 --> 45:45.820
They'll just come out with another peripheral that'll plug into the SD card slot, and then

45:45.820 --> 45:47.980
they can make their crappy games.

45:47.980 --> 45:51.100
They're gonna have, like, some stupid drum peripheral.

45:51.100 --> 45:54.580
I don't know, all their DS guitar games suck.

45:54.580 --> 45:56.700
I'm sorry, it's just...

45:56.700 --> 45:59.540
It's retarded to play Guitar Hero on the DS.

45:59.540 --> 46:00.540
I said it.

46:00.540 --> 46:01.540
There you go.

46:01.540 --> 46:08.380
It's also retarded to play Dance Dance Revolution on iPhone, a PSP, or a DS, because it makes

46:08.380 --> 46:09.380
no sense.

46:09.380 --> 46:10.780
Yeah, you're not dancing.

46:10.780 --> 46:11.780
You're not dancing.

46:11.780 --> 46:12.780
You're not...

46:12.780 --> 46:13.780
I don't know.

46:13.780 --> 46:14.780
I have to concur with you on there.

46:14.780 --> 46:20.180
Even though I used to play, like, DDR, like, with the remote control, like, when I couldn't

46:20.180 --> 46:21.780
afford to go to the arcade.

46:21.780 --> 46:26.140
What's one of the biggest iPhone games right now, in fact, so big that Apple actually displays

46:26.140 --> 46:28.380
it on a big banner inside their store?

46:28.380 --> 46:29.500
Silent Hill The Escape.

46:29.500 --> 46:30.860
No, not Silent Hill The Escape.

46:30.860 --> 46:34.540
Tap Tap Revenge.

46:34.540 --> 46:37.500
Tap Tap Revenge is like a somewhat DDR clone.

46:37.500 --> 46:38.500
Hit the buttons.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.500
No.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.780
It's a clone of Amplitude.

46:40.780 --> 46:42.140
No, it's not.

46:42.140 --> 46:43.260
I've played the game.

46:43.260 --> 46:45.620
It's like Guitar Hero, if anything else.

46:45.620 --> 46:47.820
The notes scroll down and you tap.

46:47.820 --> 46:50.620
That's what it's closest to, is Guitar Hero.

46:50.620 --> 46:52.380
But still, though, you're not dancing, though.

46:52.380 --> 46:53.420
That's the thing.

46:53.420 --> 46:58.780
If it's like a BeatMania game or something like that, then yeah, that's a little bit

46:58.780 --> 47:04.980
more acceptable, because you can't play DDR on a DS.

47:04.980 --> 47:05.980
It's just weird.

47:05.980 --> 47:11.220
Although, although I did see a homebrew program, though, that could be a way that they could

47:11.220 --> 47:12.700
do DDR on a DS.

47:12.700 --> 47:16.700
It would just be, you know, with stylus strokes and stuff like that, and it looked really

47:16.700 --> 47:17.700
cool.

47:17.700 --> 47:21.380
But because it looked really cool, Konami would never do that.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.660
Of course.

47:22.660 --> 47:27.900
Alright, well, hey, speaking of some systems, there's still some love for the old systems

47:27.900 --> 47:28.900
too.

47:28.900 --> 47:33.500
In fact, systems so old that Victoria actually owns them, because she can afford them.

47:33.500 --> 47:39.020
You are such a bitch, oh my god!

47:39.020 --> 47:40.020
Shut up!

47:40.020 --> 47:41.020
I love you.

47:41.020 --> 47:42.020
Please don't.

47:42.020 --> 47:43.020
Yes, I do.

47:43.020 --> 47:47.980
PlayStation 2 reaches the 50 million sold mark in North America.

47:47.980 --> 47:53.720
PlayStation 2 has actually hit that mark, 50 million, and I believe that is more than

47:53.720 --> 47:56.780
any other system, if I'm not mistaken.

47:56.780 --> 47:58.740
So it's a lot.

47:58.740 --> 47:59.740
Wow.

47:59.740 --> 48:03.540
Because they keep breaking, and you have to keep re-buying them.

48:03.540 --> 48:11.240
So by the way, there is a note from John Kohler, the marketing head of Sony Computer Entertainment.

48:11.240 --> 48:14.100
We don't intend on discarding the system any time soon.

48:14.100 --> 48:18.060
Yeah, they still sell like hundreds of thousands of units each month, because they can't play

48:18.060 --> 48:19.060
the games on a PS3.

48:19.060 --> 48:24.580
They're going to release the PSI on April 4th for a price tag of $159.

48:24.580 --> 48:25.580
Perhaps.

48:25.580 --> 48:30.340
It would be cool if they shrunk down the PS2 even more, make it like the size of an old...

48:30.340 --> 48:31.580
Like your finger or something.

48:31.580 --> 48:32.580
Yes, the size of my finger.

48:32.580 --> 48:33.580
That would be awesome.

48:33.580 --> 48:36.140
Yeah, because I could put a DVD in my finger, dummy.

48:36.140 --> 48:37.140
I could!

48:37.140 --> 48:38.540
I could spin it around my finger, that would work.

48:38.540 --> 48:41.000
You could put it in, it would just break.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Like a lot.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
You're so weird.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
You're weird.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Shut up.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.180
Game Guru would like to point out, PS2 makes money, PS3 does not.

48:48.180 --> 48:49.180
Yep.

48:49.180 --> 48:52.380
But you know, people are saying the PS3 needs to come down in price, and then they might

48:52.380 --> 48:54.140
actually sell some more units.

48:54.140 --> 48:55.140
Who knows?

48:55.140 --> 48:56.140
Too late.

48:56.140 --> 48:57.140
Too little, too late.

48:57.140 --> 48:58.140
Yeah, I think so.

48:58.140 --> 48:59.140
It's just a little too late.

48:59.140 --> 49:04.060
It's just, might as well give up this console generation, just, you know, work on the next

49:04.060 --> 49:05.060
one.

49:05.060 --> 49:07.340
I don't know.

49:07.340 --> 49:13.980
So we talked a little bit before about the video download service that they have in Japan

49:13.980 --> 49:17.700
for the Wii, which is kind of, I don't know.

49:17.700 --> 49:21.460
It's very family friendly, I guess.

49:21.460 --> 49:26.620
Maybe they have cartoons and other Japanese programming stuff on there.

49:26.620 --> 49:32.780
Well, something similar may be coming to the US this year, actually.

49:32.780 --> 49:40.460
And apparently, FujiSoft, the company behind it, was at CES and told Gamersight that they

49:40.460 --> 49:43.980
were planning on bringing the WiiWare video service to the US.

49:43.980 --> 49:52.300
It says, we can't quite tell at the moment, but if the negotiations are a success, maybe

49:52.300 --> 49:55.500
within the year.

49:55.500 --> 50:01.100
Which is cool, but you know, we still need some better storage on the Wii.

50:01.100 --> 50:05.140
I know, I'm gonna be able to store all that video on my, you know, internal Wii drive

50:05.140 --> 50:08.980
or the SD card it doesn't know how to read off of.

50:08.980 --> 50:10.540
So what's that, Victoria?

50:10.540 --> 50:13.460
I said, I can't work the Wii, I'm like retarded.

50:13.460 --> 50:15.180
I've tried playing it.

50:15.180 --> 50:20.500
You know what's funny is that the Wii is made for people to be able to understand very easily,

50:20.500 --> 50:21.500
but you can't figure it out?

50:21.500 --> 50:23.500
Well, I can, but I'm just not good at it.

50:23.500 --> 50:25.780
I like having the little control in my hand.

50:25.780 --> 50:29.100
Well, I guess it's kind of good if you're one of those people who moves the controller

50:29.100 --> 50:32.220
to the left when you want your little person to go to the left, you know, like you're playing

50:32.220 --> 50:33.980
Mario Brothers old school.

50:33.980 --> 50:38.260
You know, just, jump right, right, right, yeah, no, I don't know.

50:38.260 --> 50:39.260
Yeah, you do.

50:39.260 --> 50:40.260
Yeah, exactly.

50:40.260 --> 50:43.700
Yeah, but I fail, epically, at the Wii.

50:43.700 --> 50:45.060
What games do you enjoy on Wii?

50:45.060 --> 50:49.220
I like that Wario one where you have to go through, do the little movements, I don't

50:49.220 --> 50:50.220
know what it's called.

50:50.220 --> 50:51.220
WarioWare.

50:51.220 --> 50:52.220
That one.

50:52.220 --> 50:56.140
Yeah, that's like one of the only games I've ever played on the Wii, other than Guitar

50:56.140 --> 50:58.620
Hero because my cousins have it on, so.

50:58.620 --> 51:00.220
Alright, good times.

51:00.220 --> 51:02.220
So you're a Wii-tard, is what you're basically saying.

51:02.220 --> 51:04.220
Yes, I'm a Wii-tard, yeah, exactly.

51:04.220 --> 51:05.220
There you go.

51:05.220 --> 51:06.220
Alright.

51:06.220 --> 51:09.380
Well, hey, if you want to get a Wii cheap, you might want to run over to Circuit City

51:09.380 --> 51:14.060
because Circuit City has gone under, and you know, so many of these companies are going

51:14.060 --> 51:15.980
under recently, it's kind of sad.

51:15.980 --> 51:20.460
I almost feel like we need a theme song on the show for when companies go under.

51:20.460 --> 51:35.300
So let me try reading the story to this music.

51:35.300 --> 51:43.180
Circuit City has announced that they are going to be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, actually

51:43.180 --> 51:48.180
no, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy already and closed 155 stores, that wasn't enough.

51:48.180 --> 51:55.060
Now they are unable to find a buyer to keep themselves afloat, they are being liquidated.

51:55.060 --> 52:02.140
So basically, sadly, and I apologize to any listeners we have who work for Circuit City

52:02.140 --> 52:07.740
because this news has got to suck, and we really hope somebody else will come in and

52:07.740 --> 52:12.500
buy up some of these old stores, but they are going under.

52:12.500 --> 52:15.780
And from what I'm hearing from people who do work for them, that I know on like Live

52:15.780 --> 52:19.900
Journal and stuff, apparently the company was horribly managed, and it's finally come

52:19.900 --> 52:20.900
back to get them.

52:20.900 --> 52:26.260
They kind of had an old business model too, I mean like, with places like Fry's and Best

52:26.260 --> 52:30.780
Buy and stuff, Circuit City was just kind of the little guy, and they just can't keep

52:30.780 --> 52:31.780
up.

52:31.780 --> 52:36.100
And they kept building them next to Best Buy's, or Best Buy's kept building them next to Circuit

52:36.100 --> 52:40.340
City, so like, you know, they kind of didn't have a chance.

52:40.340 --> 52:43.380
So and here's the interesting thing, is of course the way liquidation sales usually work

52:43.380 --> 52:46.100
is that, you know, they will be, by the way, it doesn't affect Canada.

52:46.100 --> 52:50.500
Circuit City Canada is still going because it's not the US, so you don't have a US bankruptcy

52:50.500 --> 52:51.500
thing.

52:51.500 --> 52:52.500
So Circuit City Canada is still fine.

52:52.500 --> 52:57.380
But Circuit City US, they're, you know, going under, and when a store liquidates, usually

52:57.380 --> 53:00.260
they're going to have sales for the first week, 10% off.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.900
And then the second week, 20% off, third week, 30% off.

53:02.900 --> 53:07.060
Well here's the thing is that people are already snatching up the TVs, the Xboxes and all this

53:07.060 --> 53:09.300
stuff, because they're like, OMG, 10% off.

53:09.300 --> 53:13.260
Well, Circuit City was marking half this shit up to begin with, which is probably part of

53:13.260 --> 53:14.700
the reason they're going under.

53:14.700 --> 53:16.900
So you're really sadly not going to say much.

53:16.900 --> 53:21.020
Actually they're doing some stuff 10, some stuff 20, and some stuff 30, all in the same

53:21.020 --> 53:22.020
week, so.

53:22.020 --> 53:23.020
Oh interesting.

53:23.020 --> 53:24.020
I haven't been to the one here yet.

53:24.020 --> 53:25.020
Did you check it out already?

53:25.020 --> 53:28.500
Nathan went, that's where he was going to look for his RAM or whatever, so.

53:28.500 --> 53:29.500
Oh okay, interesting.

53:29.500 --> 53:30.500
Good luck with that.

53:30.500 --> 53:31.500
I know.

53:31.500 --> 53:34.140
So I was like, all the good stuff's going to be gone already, I'm sure it went this

53:34.140 --> 53:35.140
weekend.

53:35.140 --> 53:36.140
Probably.

53:36.140 --> 53:39.940
So all that's going to be left is like DVD and CDs of bands you've never heard of, probably.

53:39.940 --> 53:44.300
Yeah, we went over to Circuit City the other day to look at their, this was before I got

53:44.300 --> 53:46.700
my new car stereo.

53:46.700 --> 53:49.260
They actually had less stereos than Walmart did.

53:49.260 --> 53:54.940
I mean, Walmart has a pretty pathetic car stereo section, I mean, I think Circuit City

53:54.940 --> 53:55.940
had like eight.

53:55.940 --> 53:58.620
I didn't know that Walmart had a car section, or car stereo.

53:58.620 --> 54:04.300
Yeah, they're very, they're, they suck, you know, I was like, looking for a price for

54:04.300 --> 54:08.380
one of them, and the woman's like, be on that shelf over here!

54:08.380 --> 54:09.980
Just like, what the fuck?

54:09.980 --> 54:12.980
Well they all just lost their jobs, I mean, they're fine.

54:12.980 --> 54:13.980
No, I'm talking about Walmart.

54:13.980 --> 54:14.980
Oh.

54:14.980 --> 54:16.900
This woman's not going anywhere, she's a bitch, but yeah.

54:16.900 --> 54:19.740
It's like Mrs. Crabtree, like, sit down!

54:19.740 --> 54:20.740
Shut up!

54:20.740 --> 54:25.180
The Circuit City people were back smoking or talking to each other or something like

54:25.180 --> 54:26.300
that, they were nowhere to be found.

54:26.300 --> 54:29.580
I always, see, here's the thing, I always liked shopping at Circuit City, actually.

54:29.580 --> 54:32.860
I liked going to Circuit City to shop because it was never crowded, and there was never

54:32.860 --> 54:36.140
any lines, because nobody was there.

54:36.140 --> 54:39.820
I mean, honestly, I mean, I hate to be rude, but it was actually kind of a selling point

54:39.820 --> 54:40.820
to me.

54:40.820 --> 54:44.420
Remember that one time, back when they were selling Weez and stuff, and we went, we drove

54:44.420 --> 54:47.180
by the Circuit City, and there was like, no one there?

54:47.180 --> 54:51.200
Yeah, it was the night the Weez came out, and Best Buy had a line like, going around

54:51.200 --> 54:54.300
the block, remember we went out, like, when the Weez came out, we were giving out, what

54:54.300 --> 54:59.220
was it, orange soda, and so we were trying to sell our show to locals, and so we did

54:59.220 --> 55:02.740
that, went to Best Buy, and then Circuit City had like, five people.

55:02.740 --> 55:05.020
Wow, that's great.

55:05.020 --> 55:06.020
Poor guys.

55:06.020 --> 55:10.020
I feel bad, you know there's someone who listens to this show who works for Circuit City, who

55:10.020 --> 55:14.020
just loves their job, who's a little pissed, that we're riffing on them a little bit, and

55:14.020 --> 55:15.220
it does suck, you know.

55:15.220 --> 55:19.460
You know, I have friends, actually, from school that worked at Circuit City, but they kind

55:19.460 --> 55:23.780
of knew it was coming, you know, they've been looking for a little while for another job,

55:23.780 --> 55:27.300
you know, like, they had something lined up, they knew this was gonna happen, so, I mean,

55:27.300 --> 55:29.780
it sucks, but, they prepared, you know, they've known.

55:29.780 --> 55:35.020
Well, I hope that's the case, so, good luck to all those that were impacted, and unless

55:35.020 --> 55:38.580
you were part of the reason Circuit City went under, like, you're one of these upper managements

55:38.580 --> 55:43.380
that didn't know what you were doing, then, well, sucks, doesn't it?

55:43.380 --> 55:50.540
Alright, well, apparently there was a story about this dog that was as dead as Circuit

55:50.540 --> 55:53.300
City for at least a moment.

55:53.300 --> 55:54.300
Wow.

55:54.300 --> 56:01.500
Apparently a woman in Michigan nearly killed her dog when she accidentally struck it on

56:01.500 --> 56:03.540
the temple with a Wii remote.

56:03.540 --> 56:09.740
Yes, she was busy doing some Wii Sports bowling, didn't have the wrist strap on or something

56:09.740 --> 56:15.740
like that, and the Wii remote went straight and hit the dog in the temple, killing him

56:15.740 --> 56:16.740
instantly.

56:16.740 --> 56:19.300
Poor doggy!

56:19.300 --> 56:27.340
But then, luckily though, the dog, Ozzy, was not moving and stuff, so they called a neighbor

56:27.340 --> 56:33.460
who apparently had some veterinary training, and she was able to revive the dog using mouth-to-mouth.

56:33.460 --> 56:38.980
But the dog had to be taken to the real vet, where, you know, apparently it had some severe

56:38.980 --> 56:44.540
brain swelling due to cardiac arrest, but the dog, you know, apparently is fine now.

56:44.540 --> 56:45.540
Yay!

56:45.540 --> 56:48.060
Wait, she had to kiss the dog on the mouth?

56:48.060 --> 56:49.060
Not kiss.

56:49.060 --> 56:50.060
Yeah, full-on, like, mouth-to-mouth.

56:50.060 --> 56:54.020
No, no, it's not mouth-to-mouth, it's actually nose.

56:54.020 --> 56:56.020
You have to blow down the dog's nose.

56:56.020 --> 56:57.020
Oh.

56:57.020 --> 56:58.020
Okay, well.

56:58.020 --> 56:59.940
I love dogs, but not that much.

56:59.940 --> 57:00.940
Aww.

57:00.940 --> 57:04.300
Hey, if my cat was dying, I'd do that.

57:04.300 --> 57:05.700
Fuck that, it's my cat.

57:05.700 --> 57:06.700
Fuck that.

57:06.700 --> 57:07.700
It's a family.

57:07.700 --> 57:08.700
It's got these boogers on its nose.

57:08.700 --> 57:09.700
I'm gonna...

57:09.700 --> 57:10.700
No, I understand.

57:10.700 --> 57:11.700
Yeah, that'd be like, I'm happy.

57:11.700 --> 57:15.780
Oh, Irene's dying, but her breath kinda smells...

57:15.780 --> 57:19.220
Hey, I wouldn't blame you, Matt.

57:19.220 --> 57:21.460
I think I'm just gonna let her die, you know?

57:21.460 --> 57:24.340
Rob, I'm never gonna give you, like, mouth-to-nose.

57:24.340 --> 57:27.340
I mean, you're dear to me, but that's nasty, and I wouldn't...

57:27.340 --> 57:29.540
Just let me die, right?

57:29.540 --> 57:31.540
Maybe your mouth, but your nose.

57:31.540 --> 57:32.540
Hell nah.

57:32.540 --> 57:33.540
Aww, the dog is...

57:33.540 --> 57:35.980
And then when I wake up, I'd be like, ew, why are you trying to kiss me, pervert?

57:35.980 --> 57:39.420
And then I'd throw a Wii Mode at your temple, and like, hope you die.

57:39.420 --> 57:40.780
That's wrong, you shouldn't joke about that.

57:40.780 --> 57:41.780
You don't know.

57:41.780 --> 57:42.780
I know, it's a cute puppy.

57:42.780 --> 57:43.780
Alright.

57:43.780 --> 57:44.780
Aww.

57:44.780 --> 57:48.620
And then later, pretty soon, there will be video of these Wii accidents, as if there

57:48.620 --> 57:52.940
aren't enough already, of people destroying their TVs and stuff, showing up on YouTube.

57:52.940 --> 57:57.100
And the ironic thing now is that it'll be much easier to watch someone break their Wii

57:57.100 --> 57:58.100
on a Wii.

57:58.100 --> 58:01.900
And the reason why I say that is that, you know, who doesn't love to watch YouTube?

58:01.900 --> 58:05.260
Like when you're having a party, and somebody says, hey, did you see that thing on Saturday

58:05.260 --> 58:06.260
Night Live?

58:06.260 --> 58:08.940
Hurry up, let's look it up on YouTube before they remove it.

58:08.940 --> 58:12.220
You run onto YouTube, right, and you get it on the TV, but unfortunately, YouTube kinda

58:12.220 --> 58:14.860
sucks to look at on the TV, right?

58:14.860 --> 58:21.540
Well now, YouTube has launched a special site, it's at www.youtube.com slash TV, and if you

58:21.540 --> 58:26.820
go to the site on your PlayStation 3 or your Nintendo Wii, it's a new site that's like,

58:26.820 --> 58:28.540
optimized for those.

58:28.540 --> 58:35.140
So it's much easier to browse YouTube, and yeah, and I've heard great things about it.

58:35.140 --> 58:39.940
So props to YouTube for finally, a year later, getting their site optimized to use on the

58:39.940 --> 58:40.940
TV.

58:40.940 --> 58:41.940
That's great.

58:41.940 --> 58:46.580
I was gonna say, though, that there is a video, I guess it's a news report about the dog that

58:46.580 --> 58:51.260
died on YouTube, so it's, if you search for a woman's, they have a, what is it, a dog

58:51.260 --> 58:53.180
killed by Wii Remote, and then you can-

58:53.180 --> 58:54.580
Wait, but the dog actually lived!

58:54.580 --> 58:55.580
The dog lived!

58:55.580 --> 58:56.580
He was only dead for five minutes.

58:56.580 --> 58:57.700
Okay, cause I don't, you know, it's-

58:57.700 --> 58:59.180
Which makes him a zombie!

58:59.180 --> 59:01.700
Wait, he was dead for five minutes?

59:01.700 --> 59:02.700
Yes.

59:02.700 --> 59:06.500
I thought you could start getting, like, brain damage after, like, three or four minutes.

59:06.500 --> 59:07.500
Doctor dumb.

59:07.500 --> 59:08.500
So, you know-

59:08.500 --> 59:09.700
Like, what are they gonna damage?

59:09.700 --> 59:10.700
You know?

59:10.700 --> 59:11.980
I guess that's true.

59:11.980 --> 59:12.980
Aww, that's what makes them adorable, though.

59:12.980 --> 59:16.900
And it's one of those dogs, I forget what they call it, it's not a collie, but it's,

59:16.900 --> 59:17.900
um-

59:17.900 --> 59:18.900
It's like Lassie?

59:18.900 --> 59:20.900
It's like a miniature collie or something, what do they call it?

59:20.900 --> 59:22.500
Yeah, it's like a mini Lassie.

59:22.500 --> 59:24.140
She killed Lassie!

59:24.140 --> 59:25.140
Yeah.

59:25.140 --> 59:26.580
Border collie?

59:26.580 --> 59:27.580
Is the normal thing?

59:27.580 --> 59:28.580
Right?

59:28.580 --> 59:33.100
I don't know if it's a border collie, it's like a miniature collie, I don't know.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.100
Cause border collies are a little bit bigger.

59:35.100 --> 59:36.100
Man, I don't know.

59:36.100 --> 59:37.100
They're, like, Lassie-sized.

59:37.100 --> 59:38.100
Yeah.

59:38.100 --> 59:40.100
That's what Lassie is, a border collie.

59:40.100 --> 59:41.100
Anyways.

59:41.100 --> 59:42.100
Sorry.

59:42.100 --> 59:45.380
Distracted by the dog.

59:45.380 --> 59:54.140
So, there's some other interesting stuff, a little bit more positive, I guess, for Nintendo.

59:54.140 --> 01:00:02.660
There's a new patent that shows Nintendo is possibly working on a motion-sensing DS card.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:07.340
Perhaps, you know, something that was similar to, like, what they had for the Game Boy Advance,

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.620
you know, for different games.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.700
I think one of the Warioware games had it.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.860
But it's a DS direction-sensing card.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.860
Hmm.

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:21.260
No word on what it's gonna be used for, but it's something that has built-in direction

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.260
and motion tracking.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.980
So, I can get my iPhone's games ported to my DS, because that's what I see happening

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.980
when this comes out, is that now we'll just get ports of iPhone games on the DS.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:30.980
Yeah.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.980
With that whole little TILTI thing.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.020
I can get Silent Hill The Escape on my DS.

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020
Wouldn't that be fabulous?

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020
Wow.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:37.020
That's exactly what you wanted, huh?

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.020
I know.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.020
Okay.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.580
No, they didn't do a Silent Hill game on the DS.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.220
They did a Resident Evil game on the DS, and that was not very good.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:49.420
Was there, like, a play novel or something that was on the DS?

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:53.060
But a motion-sensing card, I mean, those DS cards are not exactly that big, so that's

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:54.060
pretty impressive.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.980
I would think that they would just do, well, the actual chips that do the motion-sensing

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.900
are really super tiny, so it could be done.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:07.940
It's just, I don't know, and really, I mean, you can have those things kind of hang out

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:13.180
of the slot a little bit, you know, because I remember with, like, the WarioWare one that

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.660
they had, it was pretty big.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.700
I mean, I guess technology was a little bit older then, but, you know, the card itself

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:25.260
was huge compared to what normal Game Boy Advance, you know, cards look like, so.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.260
Very interesting.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.260
I like this comment in chat.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.860
Sy says this in chat room, what the hell?

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.020
Why not have that in the DSi?

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.220
A new system is just out and already an add-on that should be built in.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.820
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.140
Just like the Wii Motion Plus, something that should have been done in the first place.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.300
Because Nintendo really cares about its customer base.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.020
Damn it, we're not getting into that argument.

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:51.500
Well, alright, I guess we'll see what comes to this, or what possible game they could

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.740
be making with this, who knows, but, uh.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.880
It's gonna suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.380
It's gonna be like Wii Sports for the DS or something, can you imagine that?

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:05.380
Wii Bowling, people throwing their DSs, oh no, I broke my DS, like, guess I gotta go

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:10.820
buy a new DSi, I see conspiracy here.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:16.060
Well this will be an interesting game when it comes out, Final Fantasy Legend 2 is being

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.220
remade for the DS.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.100
Wait, is that the Game Boy one?

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.100
Yes.

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.660
Okay, the one that's not really like Final Fantasy, the one that's more like part of

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.660
the Saga series?

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:31.700
You got it, it was actually Saga 2, Hiho Densetsu, and that was Final Fantasy Legend

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:32.700
here.

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:33.700
I love when you pronounce Japanese.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.700
Shut up.

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:40.340
But yeah, it's getting the full 3D little views and things, kind of like Final Fantasy

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.420
4 and the Dragon Quest games have had, so that's being released here.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:49.660
Awesome, I actually think I still have Final Fantasy Legend 2 or 3 on my old Game Boy cartridge.

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:54.020
Yeah, and in this Japanese magazine, they are definitely selling it as Saga 2, so.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.020
Awesome.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.020
Yeah.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.020
I liked the Saga series, I'm like the only person in the world.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.620
Maybe they'll call it Saga when it comes out over here instead of Final Fantasy.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:06.620
Um, maybe, because it would be very weird to have Final Fantasy Legend 2 come out over

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.980
here, you know, and it would be kind of like, well, whatever happened to the first two,

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.060
because who remembers that far back of the Game Boy, you know?

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.940
Well, yeah, I guess that's true.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:17.020
Let's just hope that they never do a Mystic Quest remake.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.500
I somehow don't see that happening.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.620
Mystic Quest wasn't terrible.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.620
But it wasn't good.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:26.220
Yeah, I'll just leave it at that, it wasn't terrible.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.220
Anyhow.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.220
Anyways.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.220
That's it.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:35.460
So, yes, it figures that the homebrew community, of course, is doing something that Nintendo

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:39.060
isn't doing on their own.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:43.860
A new device has come out, Matrix Wii Z.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:52.740
It's being prototyped right now, but it basically is sort of a mod chip that plugs into your

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:53.740
Wii system.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.660
There's actually no modification really being done to the hardware, it's just a plug mod,

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:02.780
so you unhook one of the ribbon cables, plug it into this mod device, and then plug another

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.700
ribbon cable into where you'd normally plug the original ribbon cable.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:13.020
It sounds kind of complicated, but what this actually does, it will allow you to not only

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:20.100
do the same stuff as a normal mod chip, but it has a connector for a SATA external HD

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:27.380
or a hard drive, so you can attach an external hard drive to the Wii.

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.380
And so I can put...

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.440
So, well, they say that you can put ISO's on there and stuff like that and actually

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.340
run pirated games for them, but you can...

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.940
Oh, I wouldn't want to encourage people to do that.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940
No, no, no.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.540
You can also, it will, the system itself will look at it like it's part of the actual storage

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.960
on the device, so you can, you know, use it for storing games.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:52.420
But this, yeah, you can actually store ISO's and stuff, so.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.660
Rob just tried to rape me.

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.920
Well, you were falling asleep, so I went over there to give you a lap dance, and I was getting

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.920
a cookie.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.920
So, because...

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.140
I'm frightened.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:03.740
All I hear is blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah, and I'm not hearing...

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.260
You shoved your dong in her face, okay?

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.020
I did not shove my dong in her face.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.620
You were like, how many licks does it take, and you were like, I'm waving your dong in

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.620
her face.

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.380
No, I waved a snickerdoodle in her face.

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.860
Oh, yeah, that's what they call it, your snickerdoodle.

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.580
And that's why you thrusted your nut sack in my face.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.200
I was like, oh my gooses.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.980
You make it sound like I'm not wearing pants or something.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:24.980
You're not.

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:32.020
But yeah, it's basically, this device will allow super fast loading of ISOs in homebrew,

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.020
so.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.020
Yeah.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.020
Awesome.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.020
Hooray.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.060
I'm sorry, I was just hearing blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah, a system that

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:41.460
doesn't have any games out on it I care about, blah, blah, blah.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.020
But Rob, what?

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:46.380
They're doing, you know, the new play control...

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:51.260
Yes, that's a title that they stuck with, you know, for instead of play on the Wii,

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:57.420
you know, new play control, Mario, was it Mario Power Tennis and the new play control

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.420
Pikmin.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.100
Aren't you excited about those?

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.260
I mean, those games are totally new and not ever been out on the GameCube.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.140
Oh, wait, no, they have.

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:06.140
Sad.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:10.220
Irene, care to comment on anything?

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.900
What Wii games are you looking forward to, Irene?

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.020
I'm dying to know.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:17.980
You know, things and stuff.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.180
That's probably actually a Wii game that's coming out with things and stuff.

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:22.180
Things and stuff.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:25.060
When it's a collection of mini games.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.060
That's what it is.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.060
Yay.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.060
Things and stuff.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.100
Sounds like a dream game to me.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.100
You too?

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.100
Oh my gosh.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.100
Shut up.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.420
Is that coming out on the Wii in April?

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:37.420
On April 4th.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.420
Can't wait.

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.420
Things and stuff.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.420
Yeah.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.420
Shut up.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.340
They said I'll wave my dong in people's faces, okay?

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.380
That's one of the mini games, actually, in things and stuff.

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.380
No, I'm never buying that game then.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.940
You take your thingy and wave it in Victoria's face.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:51.900
Yeah, take your stuff.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:52.900
Yup.

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:57.620
Well, hey, whatever Nintendo's doing, it's working, because do you know how many Wiis

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.460
they sold in December?

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:05.160
Five million consoles sold by Nintendo in December, although that's a little bit...

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.540
It's actually not Wiis alone.

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:11.580
It was actually the DS sold three million, and the Wii sold two million, so you put it

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.780
together, they sold five million systems that Nintendo moved.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.780
That's a lot of dead Collies.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.980
Matt!

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:26.220
Matt's gonna wipe out the Collie species off this plant.

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.220
You are terrible.

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:29.660
Lassie will be just a memory.

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:32.700
Well, she is, but she's dead.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:35.700
Look, that's okay.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:39.500
And Timmy will be stuck in the well forever.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.300
Where's Jamie here to yell at you?

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:46.660
But look, the reason why this is newsworthy is December, hello, Christmas.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.540
So these are the numbers that were going into the Christmas and what ended up under people's

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.540
trees.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:58.980
So, yeah, three million DS's, two million Wiis, one and a half about million Xbox 360s,

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:03.740
one million PSPs, three quarters of a million PS3s.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:04.740
Big surprise.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.020
And not even half a million PS2s, but still, you know, going in there.

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.900
Yeah, it's kind of an old system, so that's actually pretty good.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.900
Dark Tetsuya says OLR's gonna get an angry email from PETA.

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:21.740
I hope we do, because Jamie would have to read it.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:25.260
And Jamie is very opinionated when it comes to PETA.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:30.140
So I would actually, I welcome them to write the email, please, by all means.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.140
Come on the show.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:36.580
In fact, I totally encourage people going out and murdering animals with Wii remotes

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.580
and controllers.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.340
And why stop at the Wii?

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.180
I mean, hell, look at the original Xbox controller.

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:49.020
That thing is like a blunt object of death.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.020
Try dropping an original Xbox on a dog?

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.020
God, I hope the kids know he's not serious.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.020
Oh, they'd never survive.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.020
Please, please.

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:55.020
You can take out like three dogs with that thing.

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020
Oh, God, am I really here right now?

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.020
Yeah, three like great veins with those.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.020
Am I really here?

01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.180
Like, Christ.

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.180
If we get sued, I don't want any part of this.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.180
You know, you're gonna get sued by.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.180
I'm distancing myself.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.180
I love PETA or some shit.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:08.460
Did you ever see Mythbusters where they were, there was the myth where they dropped the

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:11.780
frozen turkey on a dog and to see what kind of damage it would do.

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.380
So they made this like analog dog and they dropped the turkey on it and it just shattered

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.380
the dog.

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:19.260
So can you imagine what happened with an Xbox?

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.100
I mean, those things are heavy.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.020
Oh, oh, frozen Xbox.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.020
Oh, my God.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.020
Frozen Xbox.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:30.620
You drop it and then the world like breaks in half because it's so way out of this show.

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.620
It's not ridiculous.

01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.620
Could happen.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:34.620
Yes.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:35.620
I do.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:36.620
You know what?

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.860
It's the Wii Fit Balance Board.

01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:43.220
I mean, that thing is pretty big and it does wake a bit.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.220
It's pretty sizable.

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.220
It's pretty sizable.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.220
You could.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.780
I'm not advocating anything.

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.180
I'm just saying it could happen.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.060
Matt's the one who's saying you should kill animals.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:55.380
I'd like to drop a frozen turkey on Miley Cyrus.

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:58.460
I don't know about anybody else out there.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.460
Kill that bitch.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.700
She gets to fucking die.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.220
Hey, have you seen the trailer for the new movie?

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.220
No.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.220
Tyra Banks is in it.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.060
Oh, shit.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.060
I might have to go.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.660
See, that's what I would, if I had a radio show, I'd be all about celebrities and all

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.660
that shit.

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.660
Me and Rob talked about it for a while.

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:14.660
This is a possibility.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:15.660
This is a kind of possibility.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:16.660
I think it'd be pretty fierce.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.660
Maybe.

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:18.660
Yep.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:19.660
All right.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:20.660
I don't know.

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:21.660
That's enough of me saying stuff that's...

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.660
Yes, please.

01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:23.660
Can we get some release dates for God's sake?

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:24.660
No.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.660
I guess.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.660
Whatever.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.660
Oh, perfect.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.460
Anyways, so this week we've got a few things coming out.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:31.460
I mean, it's January.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.460
It's pretty slow still.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.340
There's some good stuff.

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.820
Star Ocean Second Evolution for the PSP.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:37.940
That's going to be a pretty good game.

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:43.900
You know, some of these Square Enix PSP games are doing very well, so that one's awesome.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.700
Jumble Madness for the DS.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:49.020
It's a bunch of word puzzles and stuff, hooray.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.140
Big Bang Mini on the DS.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.260
We actually played this, I think, at South Peaks booth.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:55.260
Pretty fun.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:11:01.180
It's kind of a little bit like, what was it, Fanavision and a space shooter type game.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:02.180
Yeah, it was neat.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.180
Yeah.

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:05.060
Something that needs a die and a fire.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:06.060
Imagine Fashion Party.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.060
Yeah, no thanks.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.060
Let's see here.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:14.060
So these are the games I'm going to get for Victoria, because she loved this type of game.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:15.060
Imagine Fashion...

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.060
Okay, look.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.060
No, no, no, no.

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.000
This bitch right here.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.700
We were walking through Walmart, and we got to the section with the top model clothes,

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.020
and she was like, oh, top model.

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.900
I got a top model tank top for Christmas, so bite me.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:34.540
Can you imagine the possibilities with that game?

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.300
Shut up.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.300
Let's see here.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:44.140
I was going to say, also, the Ultimate Shooting Collection on the Wii.

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.980
It's three Japanese arcade shooter games.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.980
They're actually pretty good.

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.380
I'm trying to remember what was in it.

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:56.660
It was Cororius, Radio Allergy, and I don't remember the last one that was in there.

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:01.140
But really, bullet hell shooter games.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.140
Oh.

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.140
Okay.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.020
That's cool.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:07.060
Wonder World Amusement Park for the DS.

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:09.860
A bunch of mini games on there.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:14.460
Artonaliko 2, the Melody of Melofechesa, I guess.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.640
I don't know.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.640
Was that a Disney villain?

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.640
Melofechesa?

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:19.640
No, I'm sorry.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.640
I totally butchered that.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.860
The Melody of Metapholycia, I guess.

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.860
I don't know.

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.860
Felicio?

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.860
I'm so done with that.

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:29.860
Okay.

01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.860
With some extra crap.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.860
It's on the PS2.

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.860
Wow.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.660
The subtitle to that, none of which I just said.

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.660
So there you go.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:45.940
Anyways, Skate 2 is coming out on PS3 and 360 this week as well.

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:52.220
And let's see here, tying in perfectly what we were talking about just before I started

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.100
talking about release dates.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:59.700
Sim animals, another sim game where you get to control the wonders of nature.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:04.860
In fact, they actually have this hand, which is the pointer, and you can poke badgers and

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.680
stuff and they will attack your hand.

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680
It's awesome.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.880
Badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.580
Is it football or mushroom?

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.580
Mushroom.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:16.580
It's football, isn't it?

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:17.580
I don't know.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.580
I think it's mushroom.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.580
It's mushroom.

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:20.580
Yeah, it's okay.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:21.740
But that'll be out on the Wii and the DS.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:23.280
So awesome.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.300
Can you simulate, you know, dropping stuff on your animals?

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.620
You can throw animals.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:34.360
I saw them shaking a squirrel violently, so I'm sure you can throw rocks at them.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.360
Why would you shake a squirrel?

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.600
Or maybe feed them to other things.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.280
Are you done with US release dates?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.720
We need to take, like, the bear in that game and just feed it all sorts of animals, and

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.840
they'll become rabid and just eat things.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.840
I know.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.840
Very rare bear.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.160
I'm trying my hardest, okay?

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.800
It just never works.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.200
Moving on to the UK and the release dates over there.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.200
We need a British accent.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.200
British accent.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.600
Oh, you want me to do it in British accent?

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.840
I do, yes please.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.280
Well, I really annoy everybody overseas when I talk like this.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280
It's a really bad British accent, I'll give you that.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.280
It's a really bad one.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.280
Do you want to read these in British accent, Victoria?

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.280
No, I don't want to read them in British accent.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.280
Why not?

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.280
Because.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.280
I think you should.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.280
Why?

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.280
Well, do you want me to get you some tea and some crumpets?

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280
Put you in the mood?

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
I don't like tea and crumpets.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280
Okay.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.280
Okay, knock it off.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.880
If you're going to talk in an accent, talk like you're from New York, alright?

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880
Don't be such a wanker.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880
Alright.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880
You're a wanker.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:30.800
On the 20th, I'm going to get so much hate mail this week.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.800
On the 23rd.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.200
British accent.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:47.280
On the 23rd, Football Manager Live is coming to the PC and Neopets Puzzle Adventures coming

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:50.920
out as well on the DS and the PFC and the Wii.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.480
I don't know who's bloody playing Neopets, but somebody is for sure.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:04.640
On Skate 2 comes out for the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:11.280
I'm not doing a Japanese accent for the Japanese releases.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.280
Stop it.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.280
Left 4 Dead comes out.

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:18.520
The Japanese version on January 22nd on the Xbox 360.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.040
The Playstation 3.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.600
See, she can do that because she's actually Asian.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.840
I do it and I'm a racist.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.960
Well you are.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:37.600
Playstation 3, Prince of Persia, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw, and Juice 2 all getting releases

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.520
in Japan.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:49.960
And on the Nintendo Wii, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party, Fragile, Sayonara, Suki no Haikayo,

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:54.080
Suzumiya Harui no Gekidou comes out as well.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.080
What?

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.080
You want to read them?

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.080
No.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080
You think you can do better?

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.080
Probably.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.680
I think anybody could do better.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.680
I'm sorry.

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.360
Playstation 2.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.800
Some price reductions for Destroy All Humans and Juice 2.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:16.640
On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer comes out as well as Rayman what?

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:23.080
When you said that, you said Destroy All Humans and Juice 2, but I thought you said Juice

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.080
2.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.480
It sounded like Destroy All Humans and Juice 2.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.720
I'm like, but they're humans too.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.080
You know, I don't even think that would be acceptable in Japan, let alone here.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.920
I know they get away with some pretty crazy stuff, but not that.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.240
That was awful.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.880
Man, our show has really gone downhill.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880
It has.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.480
We lose Jamie and seriously, it just goes to shit.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:52.320
It's Rob's fault because he can't do a good British accent.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.400
I know, my British accent single-handedly ruined the show.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:05.040
On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party, Te Guato DS Series

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.320
1, Tetsudo Data File.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.240
What the hell that is.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.640
But a game called Zubo is coming out in Japan, I bet that's pretty awesome.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.640
So there you go.

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640
Wow.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:17.640
Zubo?

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.640
Mm-hmm.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.920
I think that's a music game that's from EA.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:26.920
They look like crap.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:32.920
And on the Sony PSP, we have Patapon 2 comes out.

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:36.520
At least the Chinese version comes out in other Asian territories.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:38.400
Ratchet and Clank gets a price reduction.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:46.400
Looks like the only new game, Hokuto no Ken Rao Gaiden, Ten no Haoa comes out.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400
That's what it's called.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400
Totally.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.480
Sort of.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.240
It's a fighting game coming out on the PSP.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.240
There you go.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.240
Good times.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.280
There's your Japanese releases.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.280
Let's move on with the news.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.280
I need a break.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.280
Oh, those were Japanese?

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.280
We need to get to...

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.280
We need to get to the end of the par day.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.720
I need to go flush my head down the toilet.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.720
Alright.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:11.880
Well, there's lots of download content coming to our music games here.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:19.200
Starting off with Guitar Hero World Tour, they're getting a Travis Barker track pack.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:29.040
And featured in there will be What's My Age Again by Blink-182, Lo, the Travis Barker

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:40.560
remix by Flo Rida, featuring T-Pain, and Looks Like a Lycanthrope by Plus44.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:49.680
And that'll be available for 160 Microsoft points per track, or 440 for the entire bundle.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.680
And no word on what the real money is.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:57.480
I think, what is it, 160 is two bucks per.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:03.120
And let's see, Rock Band is getting some interesting stuff.

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:11.400
Steve Miller, there's gonna be a Steve Miller Band 3-pack with Space Cowboy, Take the Money

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.440
and Run, and The Joker.

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.920
All of those will be available for 160 Microsoft points each, or $2.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.560
And the pack will run you 440 Microsoft points, or $5.49.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:30.880
And then the individual songs, you'll be getting I Stand Alone by Godsmack, Feed the Tree by

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:37.360
Belly, Wind Me Up by Ghost Hounds, Typical by Mute Math, and Warzone by Rob Zombie.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:41.120
And if I remember correctly, I think Warzone says new single.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.320
And all those will be available for...

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320
Where's Dragula?

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320
That song's awesome.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.040
And I wanna play that on Rock Band.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.040
Well that's...

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.760
It's back in the 90s, Rob.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.280
Shut up, I hate you.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.280
Anything.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:58.080
Warzone wasn't that good from what I remember, I actually bought that.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.600
So it was okay.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.000
Not worth the single though.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.720
It's a shame.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720
Yes.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:11.240
Finally, Lips, the karaoke game, has some stuff coming out for the rest of this month.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:19.360
Available, actually came out earlier this week, When I Grow Up by the Pussycat Dolls.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:25.360
You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling by the Righteous Brothers, and Erased Rewind by the Carnagans.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.200
Those all came out on the 16th.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.120
I love that song.

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:37.160
Next week, we've got, let's see, on the 23rd here, Hate That I Love You by Rihanna featuring

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:43.280
Neo, and Thanks for the Memories by Fall Out Boy.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:46.200
Yes, they're so hip that they don't use vowels in their...

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.480
We need to have Victoria just sing these songs as Loki reads them.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.480
Yes, awesome.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.960
I'm doing it anyway.

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.120
And then finally, Look What You've Done by Jet.

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.400
I don't know that one.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.120
Look What You've Done, no I don't think that's it.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:08.720
Alright, and then finally on January 30th, Sunday Morning by Maroon 5, Take a Bow by

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.840
Rihanna, and Water Runs Dry by Boyz II Men.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:19.880
Wow, what is up with these random old songs like Belly Feed the Tree, like oh man, I was

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:24.720
so glad that made a comeback, and then like Boyz II Men, one of their songs that was not

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.880
even all that popular, like wow, okay, I guess.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.600
Some comments from chat I gotta read.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.160
Retertainment says, Why pay for tracks from Lips when I can steal them from Bittorrent

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.160
sites?

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.280
Plug in my iPod and play them for free.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:44.320
Because it's not quite the same, and I think these actually come with the videos and stuff.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.560
Leo Shen says, Where the fuck is my love fool and my favorite game?

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.400
Love Fools in Sing Star, for whatever it's worth, and it has the original video, not

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.800
the one they did in the US.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800
It's like the old school one.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800
I like your Race and Rewind.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800
That's a good song.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800
I do too.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.200
I like my favorite game too, and I don't know what a good karaoke song that would be.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.280
That's more of a, that other series, the racing series had that in one of their ads.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.280
Gran Turismo?

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.280
Yeah.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.280
Two.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280
My favorite game was like in the commercial?

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280
It was, yeah.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.280
It was a song in the game, wasn't it?

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.280
Mm-hmm.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.280
Yeah.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280
Alright.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:19.400
My favorite game was also, I think, one of the Euro DDR games.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.400
Well speaking of...

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.000
I don't know, I could be completely wrong on that, but that's a guess.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.320
Speaking of awesome music games, this news has me very, very happy.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:34.240
The Harmonics CEO Alex Rigopoulos was interviewed with Ars Technica recently, and he has basically

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.720
professed his love for Amplitude.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720
You might remember that game.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.840
Harmonics, these are the games they did before Guitar Hero, Amplitude and Frequency.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:46.480
Well, he was basically confirming that he does want to eventually revive the series.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.480
Yay!

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.480
Excited!

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.480
That'd be awesome.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.120
So the only problem is Sony actually owns that property.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.400
Harmonics developed it, I guess, for Sony.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.200
So you ain't gonna see this on Xbox.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.840
It would probably be like a PlayStation Network type game.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.680
But hell, I don't mind.

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:05.800
I would love to see this game make a comeback because, you know, there's certain songs that

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.160
you can only get in these types of games.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.280
You're not gonna get in like a rock band type game.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.920
So I am definitely for this.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.920
I hope...

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.920
I hope they do it.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:18.560
They really need to like, revive some of those older rhythm games, like from the 90s and

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.560
early 2000s.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.480
Like Guitar Freaks, and then they'll make a game called Rock...

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.480
Oh.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.840
GS68 says, did Harmonics also do Karaoke Revolution with Konami?

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:27.840
They did.

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.840
They did.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.120
They developed the first couple versions.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:33.880
And then, by the time I think they got to like, Karaoke Country, I think finally Harmonics

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880
split off.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880
And Konami did it themselves.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.840
Harmonics is like, okay, we're not doing Country, fuck that.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840
Something like that, yeah.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.840
Just kidding.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.440
That's exactly how it went down.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.440
All right.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:47.080
So we're gonna get into the classic video game of the week.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:51.800
It's a little part of the show where we like to pay homage to a game from yesteryear.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.200
A game from the past.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.400
And Dark Sakura is not here tonight to do this, so this is the part where Loki and I

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.400
will fill in.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.200
I guess we're gonna do your game tonight, because I did it last time.

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.840
So Loki is gonna pick a game for us this week.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:08.000
A classic video game that he thinks everybody out there on the internet who listens to our

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
show should be playing.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.440
Loki, what is the classic video game of the week this week?

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.200
You know, I didn't know.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.240
But actually, I just came up with one last minute.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.040
Hooray for me!

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.320
No, actually, I want to pay homage to...

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:26.440
It's not even that old, I mean, I hate thinking that a Playstation 1 game is considered retro

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.440
now.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:35.080
But I think one of the greatest in this game series, except for maybe Twisted Metal Black,

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:40.720
but Twisted Metal 2, Twisted Metal 2, as it was known in Europe as Twisted Metal 2 World

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:48.600
Tour, the second game in the vehicle combat series Twisted Metal, still one of my favorite

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.080
games, and they've remade it a few different times.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:56.640
On the PSP they had Twisted Metal 2 head on, or Twisted Metal head on, I guess it was called.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:02.240
But basically this game, very over the top, just killing each other, and each one won

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:08.480
the win the entire competition because they got a wish granted from Sweet Tooth, I believe,

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.880
or Dark Tooth, or whatever the other evil guy was.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.880
I don't remember.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:14.880
It's been a while.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.760
Doesn't really matter, because who cares about the story when you're just going around major

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:25.000
cities like Paris, and Moscow, and stuff like that, and just destroying all sorts of stuff.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.640
It was great.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.000
Paris, you can actually destroy the Eiffel Tower.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:38.120
LA, they had some ruins left over, I guess, from the previous Twisted Metal game.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:44.600
In, let's see here, New York, they had the rooftops, which I think was my favorite map

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.200
of the entire game there.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.440
Antarctica, they had some glaciers that were dropping, different icebergs sinking into

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.440
the ocean.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.440
And then Hong Kong, they had the Hong Kong Crunch, which was set in the streets of Hong

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.040
Kong.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:07.040
Of course there was some different characters that were added in the game.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.600
They had Sweet Tooth, Dark Tooth, and Minion, which could be unlocked with different codes

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.600
in the game.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.760
And I guess Dark Tooth was only playable on the PC version, or if you had a cheat device

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:23.880
for the Playstation 1, you could play Dark Tooth that way, which is kind of cool.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:31.040
And he was a giant ice cream truck, because, yes, with a clown on top, because he was Sweet

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.120
Tooth's father, if I remember correctly.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.520
Victoria actually played this game.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.360
I heard her speak up, going, I remember this game!

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.600
Yes, because Dark Tooth was Charlie Kane, and then of course Sweet Tooth was Needles

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.040
Kane, and he had the ice cream truck.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.880
Some of the other characters, Axl, which was a guy that was trapped in a vehicle, I guess,

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:56.560
by his father, with two giant tires, and so he was playing that.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:02.400
Then Grasshopper, which was a dune buggy, which apparently was Calypso's daughter, and

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:08.000
Calypso, of course, was the guy that was running the entire tournament.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:16.480
Mr. Grim, which was on a red motorcycle, and he consumed souls, which was kind of, sort

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.560
of kind of a Ghost Rider ripoff, I guess.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.880
Minion, which was pretty fun, I think that was actually one of my favorite characters

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:29.520
to play, and it was a black battle tank, and then of course Specter, who had a sports car

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.800
with the missiles that would fly through things, like ghost missiles, and then a bunch of other

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:38.120
stuff in there.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:43.740
Of course, I think that TwistML2, they had some levels that they cut out, that they brought

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:50.360
back for TwistML head-on, the PS2 version, they brought some that they had canceled actually,

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:54.800
I think they were making a, I don't know, more levels for TwistML Black that were added

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:00.600
into that game, and it was kind of a remake of TwistML2 and the TwistML Black engine,

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.800
which is pretty cool.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.560
But unfortunately we still haven't seen another TwistML game since Black, and I don't really

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.720
count the PSP ones.

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.840
But hey, you know, they were talking about remaking, these were adding, making a new

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.160
one for PS3, and I think they should do it, because it was probably one of the best series

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.720
that was on the Playstation, so.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.120
That's my classic game there.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:26.120
Alright, there you have it, Twisted Metal 2, your classic game of the week.

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120
That's a good pick.

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120
That's not, that's not good enough.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.680
That was pretty good for a last minute one, yeah.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.680
Yeah, that was good.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.040
The soccer has done Dreamcast games, and that was later in PS1.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:39.160
Yeah, you can tell that I totally remember all the backstory on this, because I totally

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.160
butchered everything.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160
That's cool.

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.160
That's alright.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160
It was last minute.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.160
You did good.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.160
You did good.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.200
Alright, so that's going to do it for part A of Orange Ons Radio, but that doesn't mean

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.320
the show's over, we're just going to take a break, and we'll be back, there's plenty

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.760
more where this came from.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.540
Your calls as well, we'll get to a little later on in the show, we have some more news

01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:01.560
in the next segment, we're going to be talking about some updates with the Pandora battery,

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.880
the controversial device for the PSP, also talk about some other PSP news, we have quite

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:10.640
a bit, as well as a very controversial Nintendo patent that was discovered this week.

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:15.700
It was something I kind of referred to earlier, to try and help those people that are really

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:19.800
bad at video games, but is it a good thing, or is it going to be a bad thing?

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:20.800
Who knows?

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.040
Anyhow, with all the talk about Silent Hill this week, for the live listeners, I'm going

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.880
to play some music from Silent Hill games, because who doesn't love the Silent Hill music,

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.680
but for those of you listening to the podcast, you don't get that because we're not allowed

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.840
to play copyright music, but we'll be right back in just a few seconds for you guys on

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.840
the podcast.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.880
For those of you listening live, we'll be back in a few minutes here on Orange Lounge

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:46.720
Radio.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.920
And we're back with more of Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast, taping

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.160
live here on January the 18th of 2009, to those of you guys who are just tuning in live

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:55.640
on AllGames.com.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.040
Thank you guys for tuning in, tonight's kind of a weird night.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:01.400
Mark Sacra is not here, she's on vacation just before school starts, so we brought in

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:06.640
two girls to replace her, well obviously she can never be replaced, but substitute tonight,

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.840
and so we have somebody who definitely looks like a naughty substitute teacher, Victoria

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.840
is here.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.840
Yeah, and she's hot.

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.840
And she was flirting with the chatters.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.840
Hi guys.

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:14.840
Oh, shut up.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.520
Oh man, all Skype's going to be, hi Victoria, how's it going?

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:24.120
I did upload the picture that was requested earlier to my Twitter during the break, so

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:30.040
the boys could see it, and then we had a couple of chatters flirting with Victoria, so that's

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.040
cute.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:35.440
So anyway, alright, but no more flirting, back to business, alright, we're back to work

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:42.000
here on Orange Lounge Radio, we got more gaming news to talk about, and yes we do, so, Loki

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.680
why don't you start us off, oh no, you're not gonna, are you starting us off, yes, alrighty

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:46.680
then.

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:53.280
Guitar Hero Metallica has been announced by Metallica that it is coming out in the US,

01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:01.400
or North America I guess, March 29th, May, pretty much everywhere else.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:05.720
It's interesting though, is the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions are coming out on the

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:12.160
29th, but the PS2 and the Wii version though are coming sometime this spring, most likely

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:19.720
early May, and this is according to the band's website, and of course, you know, it's gonna

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:26.400
have Expert Plus, 28 songs from the group's discography, as well as other tracks from

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:32.920
like Alice in Chains, The Food Fighters, Slayer, Machine Head, Queen, and stuff like that.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:38.220
What's interesting though, and this is a little bit late news here, but they're gonna have

01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:44.160
a special pre-order bonus actually being done through GameStop, which is surprising, they're

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:51.320
going to be giving away, with Guitar Hero Metallica, another drum pedal, because apparently

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:56.240
you're gonna need to have two pedals for the kick drum to be able to play some of those

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:03.640
songs, or you're probably gonna want to have two kick pedals, so that's kind of interesting.

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:09.400
But yeah, no other worry on that, but interesting to see this is gonna be the first Guitar Hero

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.020
game coming out this year, and I'm sure not the last.

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:13.120
First of many.

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.240
First of many, yeah.

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.400
How long before the series jumps the shark?

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.720
Oh wait, done!

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:25.680
Hey, Sony is going to be delivering of course more PSP and PlayStation 1 old titles on PlayStation

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:30.600
Network, and guess what, there is a PSP game that just came out I believe this week on

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.960
the PlayStation 3, it's Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:38.660
I believe Jamie spoke very highly of this game when she was here, it's kind of a put

01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.640
together compilation of some of the old Ghosts and Goblins titles, it's now available for

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.480
download for $20.

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:47.860
There you have it, you can't play it on the PlayStation 3 because it was a PSP game, but

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.780
you can use your little transfer device and put it on your PSP if you have a large storage

01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:54.500
stick for your PSP.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.500
There you have it.

01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:01.600
If you have a large stick, you can shut up, shut up.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:08.080
There is a lawsuit in place for Datel, the makers of such wonderful devices as the Wii

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.720
freeloader, which apparently I don't think works anymore, I'm not sure, that's kind of

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:19.040
in limbo there, and also a third party battery that would have made it easier to hack the

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:22.360
PSP 3000 perhaps.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:28.900
Lightblue Tool, which is their service mode battery that they've made, is just basically

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:36.400
a fancy name for the Pandora battery, they basically stole the idea for and decided that

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.600
they were going to put it out.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:43.560
However, due to legal action by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, they are not able to

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:49.040
put out said battery, and yeah, they will not be releasing it.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:54.720
But that's okay, because if you remember that there is an exploit now that's being used

01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:00.280
that will eventually allow the PSP 3000 to be hacked using Grip Shift.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:05.920
So that is coming along nicely, they already have some homebrew games available for it,

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:09.720
and soon enough a homebrew and firmware loader.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.720
Cool.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.720
Yeah.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:17.000
What do you think will happen as a result of the lawsuit?

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Nothing, they'll just stop making the battery and, you know, move on.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.080
There'll be something else to hack the PSP with later?

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:28.480
There'll be something else, but the thing is, the fact that they were even releasing

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:31.840
that battery in the first place was kind of retarded, I mean, I know it is a little bit

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:37.760
difficult to make a Pandora's battery, but it can be done.

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.360
It's not too difficult if you just follow the instructions, but the fact that they were

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:48.640
kind of making this and claiming it as their own, you know, is kind of a rip-off, because

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.520
they did not come up with this idea.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:57.320
All right, well speaking of hacking, DotHack, which is kind of a cult series on the PlayStation,

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.320
you ever played the DotHack games?

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.600
Yeah, I've never played them, but I'm familiar with them.

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:04.320
I own the very first one, the very, very first one I found for like 20 bucks somewhere.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.240
They're kind of fun, they're very niche kind of titles, but, you know, I think they had

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.240
two different series.

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:14.040
They had the DotHack series and then there was DotHack GU, which was the later series.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:20.400
Now DotHack Link was announced by Famitsu Magazine as coming to the PSP in 2009, so now it's

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.240
going from PlayStation 2 to PSP.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.880
The interesting thing though they're saying is that, you know, part of what made DotHack

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.920
kind of interesting is that it was sort of like an MMO, but it wasn't.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.600
It was a single player experience that was like an MMO, if that makes any sense.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.120
Like, you know, all the characters that you came across were scripted and everything,

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.200
but it was kind of part of the niche of the game.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.800
But they're thinking that this series is now going to be a little more like Monster Hunter,

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.360
because that's the very big series in Japan right now on the PSP.

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:50.640
So DotHack Link could be a little more Monster Hunter-esque, but I'm sure there's a lot of

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.000
anime fans that are going to be very excited to hear that DotHack is making a comeback on

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
the PSP.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Sweet.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Hooray.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Let's see here, some, I guess, interesting stuff coming out from a Sony survey, and we

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.840
all love these surveys that they put out.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:17.240
Speculation of what exactly might be coming to the PSP2, and this new survey of course

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:23.960
was asking, you know, gamers what features they would like seen in the new console, and

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.960
some of the stuff that they were suggesting here, let's see, possible features include

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:38.720
smaller, yet retain most of the current PSP screen size, offered social networking functionality

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:46.480
in the cross-media bar, included a keyboard for easier internet browsing and communication,

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:52.680
offered Bluetooth wireless support for easy pairing with other devices, had a touchscreen,

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:58.520
had an improved screen for more dynamic graphic displays, offered the ability to find others

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:06.260
near you who want to connect for online gaming, offered an e-comic book or book download service

01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:14.000
through the PlayStation Network, and included a hard drive for memory storage.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:23.400
And some other things, they were also talking about built-in GPS, and yeah, interesting.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.960
I have a feeling that they're going to do a touchscreen at the next one.

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:30.960
They kind of have to at this point, if you think about it.

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:33.400
And motion-sensoring, I mean, why not?

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:37.880
Do you think it's for, like, another PSP redo, or do you think this is for, like, the next

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:40.400
PSP, whatever it is, like the PSV2, or whatever?

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.560
I think it would have to be for the next one.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.560
I mean, they could still do another redo of it or whatever, because I think there was

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:51.200
some rumors about PSP 4000.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.880
I don't know, though, if they would just put a touchscreen on, you know, a new PSP or something

01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:56.880
like that.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.200
A lot of these, I mean, other than, like, social networking, that wouldn't be too bad,

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:04.800
or like a book download service, I mean, you can do e-books right now if you're homebrew

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:11.840
stuff, so that could be done now, and even the ability to find others near you that,

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.200
you know, want to connect for an online game.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:19.640
I don't really see that as kind of a necessity, because that would require a lot of hotspots

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.840
and stuff like that, and it wouldn't really make sense that you would need, you know,

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:27.440
to know if there's someone nearby to connect with, because you're connected with anybody

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.040
over the internet, so it doesn't really matter.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:38.480
Maybe Bluetooth support for, like, using, like, say, your 6-axis controller might be

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.680
kind of cool.

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:44.640
Let's read some comments from the chat room, chat.orensontraded.com, we've had a lot of

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.500
PSP different stories, I want to kind of read through some of these, because lots of diverse

01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.120
comments from our chat.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:54.080
Reddertainment says, why is Dattell getting sued for selling something that you can hack

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.520
the PSP with?

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.840
People who sell rocks don't get sued for possibly causing car break-ins.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.160
But this is the case with a lot of these, you know, companies that get sued, right?

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:07.900
I think it has to do with infringing on some sort of stuff, probably information that was

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:13.700
written on the ROM of the battery, because the actual batteries that Sony uses actually

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:19.000
have data written on to them, so if, for example, they use that to reverse engineer something

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:26.860
to create a program, that would violate copyrights, and then they could stop them, I guess.

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:30.880
And also probably, you know, Dattell's not really a large company, and Sony is a lot

01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.880
bigger, and they could probably bully them into doing whatever they want, so.

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:41.960
But more likely, you know, the prior, that they actually reverse engineered something,

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:50.260
and because of that, you know, it's not licensed, so, you know, they gotta put a stop to it.

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:54.240
Also some other things I want to read here, Jiove Dea, who's very excited about a new

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.420
.hack game coming out, says I wish those fuckers would have brought the actual.hack MMO over

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:04.680
even if it sucked balls, and XLink confirms there was a.hack MMO in Japan but it was

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.080
shut down.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:12.240
D5T says.hack link for the PSP is going to be the last game, FYI.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:14.920
So I don't know if it's gonna, I guess not a series, because all the other.hack games

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.440
were in series, I think the first one had four games, the other one had three, so that's

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.040
kind of weird that this would be a one-off game.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.000
Hopefully it's a lot of game, because.hack got a big, I guess a very cult-type game.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.780
There's a lot of people who've never heard of these games, but then I think there's enough

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:32.800
of our audience who like the anime and all that stuff too that I'm sure know about these

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:33.800
games.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:34.800
I was pretty excited about it.

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.740
Well you know Monster Hunter, they're basically trying to recreate Monster Hunter over, find

01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:43.240
anything that would work as a Monster Hunter game, because those are insanely popular in

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:47.120
Japan right now and especially with the new Monster Hunter game coming out on the Wii,

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.440
that's gonna probably take off really well.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.160
They're trying to find more stuff that's kinda similar to Monster Hunter and if they try

01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.640
to make their game more like Monster Hunter, then maybe they'll try to get that same type

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:00.200
of appeal that that game had.

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.880
There were some other games that they were trying to make like Monster Hunter too, I

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.680
I can't remember what it was, though.

01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:08.160
But some other series game that they're changing up.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:10.080
Interesting speculation in chat, too, by Alpha

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:14.200
Kananagrams says, maybe.hack link has DLC.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:14.600
Good.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.240
I don't know, a place for a PSP game.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.400
That would be very interesting, but good.

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:22.920
All right, anyhow, let's go into a new story, kind of

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.600
getting away from the PSP stuff a little bit.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.640
This is kind of one of those sad story things.

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:30.760
Apparently, in Illinois, there's a town there in

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:33.720
Illinois who put a new tax out on video game machines.

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.960
And it caused a small arcade to basically go under.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:39.080
It was a place called the Name Your Game Store, and it was

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.200
located in Hampshire.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.760
It was apparently a very popular after-school hangout.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.680
It had games, snacks, cards, clothing, of all things.

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:49.360
So it was kind of like a little hodgepodge of cool

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.560
stuff, sounds like, a place for kids to go hang out.

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.160
The proprietors were Bob and Gina Pearson.

01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:01.880
Apparently, a $250 annual tax per machine on these games,

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.440
they had to get rid of the 10 games that they had.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.800
Glow-in-the-dark air hockey, NASCAR racing, Ms. Pac-Man all

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.720
bit the dust because of this new tax in the town.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.920
Here's a quote from one of the owners.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.040
We didn't renew the licenses because the machines didn't

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.600
even make what you charge in these astronomical fees.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.560
The game companies tell us this is one of the highest

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:20.520
fees in Illinois.

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:22.840
We wonder if the village really researched how big this

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:25.000
should be or if they just slapped a number on it.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.240
We had become a pretty big hangout for kids after school

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.840
and weekends, but not having the video games this year has

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:32.880
made a big impact in just the first two weeks.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:36.680
So apparently, somebody who works for the town told the

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.440
local news that they set the fee high with the

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:42.840
understanding that the game machine distribution companies

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:46.040
would actually pay the fees.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.240
But one of the proprietors said that only happens when

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.400
you actually serve alcohol in the establishment.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.760
So what was the purpose of this tax or whatever it's

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.720
supposed to be?

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:58.760
Just to get money.

01:42:58.760 --> 01:42:59.360
I guess.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:42:59.840
Why not?

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.120
It's the most random thing ever.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.720
Like, oh, and by the way.

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.640
Well, in this economy, you've got to balance the budget in

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:06.360
weird ways, right?

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.160
Yeah, but that seems really weird, though, the tax.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.200
First off, arcade games.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.120
I would think, I mean, let's just look at, for example,

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.320
like Rancho Cordova or something like that.

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:18.000
I can't imagine that there's over 100 arcade

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.600
games in this city.

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.080
I would be surprised if there are over 50 arcade games in

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.480
this city, let alone enough.

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.440
I don't know of many at all that would be

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:28.320
independently owned.

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.840
Maybe at that pool place I've never been to up the street.

01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:31.600
They probably have some.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.760
But see, that's the thing, though.

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.160
It's random and arbitrary.

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.760
Oh, yeah, and all of a sudden, let's just pull

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:37.520
this out of our ass.

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:38.080
There has to be something behind it.

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:41.120
Well, it sounds like other, because when the lady quoted

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.760
about places that sell alcohol in all this, too, she sounded

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:46.280
like this isn't unheard of.

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.160
Because it sounded like she had a point of reference.

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:49.760
So I guess this whole thing is not heard.

01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.880
I'd never heard of this before.

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:53.600
But it seems weird, though, that you would be able to tax

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.760
something like that because you're still

01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.400
paying taxes on it.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.080
You're paying taxes on your revenue that you bring in.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.320
So why tax it again?

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.880
There has to be something behind it.

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:07.120
There has to be maybe it was targeted at that place or

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:09.320
something, or the places like this where kids hang out.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:11.760
Maybe they think they're going to become delinquent or

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:14.480
something if they spend their time doing that instead of

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:15.720
other stuff.

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:20.040
Tigerclaw says, if you read between the lines, this was

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:22.080
their way of getting rid of video games in these places so

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.760
kids go home and do their homework.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.640
I don't know, Tigerclaw.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.520
I kind of disagree.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.520
I think some of these kids, if they don't have another place

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:32.600
to go, they're going to turn to graffiti and murder.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:33.160
I'm just kidding.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.040
But more of the latter.

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:36.720
But you know what I'm talking about?

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.920
Like, at least in these types of places, it's, you know.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:43.520
Yeah, that's exactly what these

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.720
establishments are there for.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.600
If parents aren't enforcing their kids to, like, do their

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.960
homework and stuff, they're going in at least playing

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.440
video games or something like that.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.200
You know, they're not out on the street or anything.

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:56.160
So I just think that's kind of odd.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:59.440
In other words, kids hanging out at this place is because

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:01.880
their parents aren't making them go home

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.760
and do their homework.

01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:05.640
So if they're not here at this place hanging out, they'll be

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.320
somewhere else.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.640
Yeah, they're not going to be going home.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:08.840
They're not going to go home.

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.040
Oh, shucks.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.280
No more Ms. Pac-Man for me.

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.600
I guess I'll go do homework.

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:15.040
Because that's what my brothers and I did, like our

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:16.840
parents didn't give a shit if we came home and did our

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:17.520
homework after school.

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:20.960
So we went to the arcade, you know, like, so we probably

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.080
would have become druggies and like murderous convicts were

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.280
it not for video games.

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.160
So I don't know.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:28.720
That's just kind of wacky.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.200
I don't know.

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.760
SSJ100 Matt says, so things are going to turn into Jet Set

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:32.920
Radio, basically.

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.160
Yeah, there you go.

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:34.920
It's all going to start.

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:38.280
We're all going to strap on roller blades and go around

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:40.320
and spray paint shit.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:41.720
Yep.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.440
So kind of sad.

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:45.920
I don't know.

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.560
Maybe we should try to email these people and

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:49.120
get them on the show.

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.640
These are the types of stories I want to dig into.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.000
Are you going to be like, call Rob or whatever?

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.800
Not, you know, like the local show?

01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.480
Like the local news and stuff?

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.520
Well, here's the thing.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.840
All the other shows, you know, they're trying to get the one

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.520
up guys and all that on their show.

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:06.840
Because that's what everybody's, you know, I don't

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:09.120
care, I'm over all that stuff.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.160
Let's get these little niche stories and get them on the

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.520
show and talk about why was your town out to screw you?

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:16.320
We want answers.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.560
We demand to know.

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:22.680
Asking questions, getting answers.

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.360
Oh my God, Rob, you're going to make an impact.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.280
All right, we'll see.

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:27.840
We'll see.

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.440
All right, let's move on.

01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:31.360
Loki, do you have some other news for us?

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.200
Maybe happier news?

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.120
Maybe this is why they're getting rid of the arcades for

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.480
games like Mortal Kombat.

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.400
Yes, that's right.

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.520
The Mortal Kombat killer has gotten 36 years.

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.720
Lamar Roberts, the teenager convicted of beating to death a

01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:50.040
seven-year-old, will be sentenced to 36 years.

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.320
Apparently, this happened in 2007.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.840
I guess they beat up Zo Garcia, a seven-year-old who

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.560
was described, I guess, by prosecutors and law

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.320
enforcement in Greeley, Colorado.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:09.600
They were beating her up as an reenactment of the fight

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.720
moves from Mortal Kombat.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:14.880
And says Robert and his 17-year-old girlfriend were

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.720
supposedly supposed to be babysitting the child.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.920
They uppercutted a baby.

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:23.480
And said that two kicked, hit, and slammed his half

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.080
sister to the floor.

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:31.360
OK, did they confuse their babality with the fatality?

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:32.480
I can't even joke.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:33.040
This is terrible.

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.000
I know, that is awful.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.440
I probably shouldn't have said that, but wow.

01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:41.200
They must be stupid.

01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.160
Only 36 years, just 36 years.

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:45.360
I mean, really?

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.440
Really?

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.240
Seriously?

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:51.080
Are prisons like that hard up for cash?

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:52.320
Yeah, that's pretty sad.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.880
But here's something you can laugh at, because it's funny

01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:55.960
and it's ridiculous.

01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.560
And I don't think anyone got hurt.

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:03.600
But apparently, there is a new assailant to compete against

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.120
the Mortal Kombat killer for press, the Xbox Taco

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:09.880
assailant.

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.040
Yes, apparently law enforcement near Orlando, Florida.

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.800
This is one of the stories that I've read so far, so it's good.

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.680
They have in custody a 19-year-old who refused to

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.760
stop playing games to join his family for dinner and throw a

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:27.920
taco at his mother after she unplugged his Xbox.

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:33.240
Apparently, this was reported as a domestic disturbance.

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:40.720
And apparently, there is some name calling that says,

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.520
seems his mom went upstairs and demanded he stop playing

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:47.680
that Sega or Atari or whatever you call it and come down to be

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:50.160
a contributing member of the family.

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:55.560
And he was all, whatever, bitch, she said.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.760
And he flung the taco.

01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:59.160
Is this for real?

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:02.000
Yeah, he says they actually have a screen capture from the

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.440
news thing, and he's making a weird little face on it.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.680
Yeah, WFL-TV is the news station covering it.

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.400
And she says she was going to let him sit in his jail cell

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.880
for a few days and teach him a lesson.

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:20.800
They need to show no mercy to this kid.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.120
It's funny, it's all a few minutes.

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.240
You know what they should do as punishment is make him work

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.200
a Taco Bell and see what exactly it takes to get in to

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.960
make a taco, because I don't know anybody who's ever worked

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.200
a Taco Bell that would enjoy their job.

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.080
Here's the quote from Dina, his sponsor.

01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.840
A few minutes later, Dina says she was in the kitchen

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.880
cleaning and cooking tacos for dinner when Zachary showed up.

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:47.720
That's when she says he slapped her arm and threw a

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.880
taco in her face.

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:55.320
He went ahead and hit me with the taco and I got taco all

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.760
over my shirt and the kitchen.

01:49:56.760 --> 01:49:58.560
I've threatened to call the police before.

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:01.520
But anyway, this time I thought he went too far, so I

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:04.280
called the police and he's in jail now.

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.960
Leo Shen sums it up in chat, says that he should rot in

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.880
jail, he wasted a good taco.

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:13.080
That's taco side, no one commits taco side.

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:16.440
I can imagine Eric right now like, no.

01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:19.360
All right, and finally, this is a little bit more recent.

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:26.400
There's a 17-year-old, Daniel Petrick of Ohio, he's been

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.400
found guilty of shooting both of his parents, which led to

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:33.320
the death of his mother, his dad, survived.

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:37.480
And apparently he has been found guilty.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:42.200
This was because they took away Halo from him, Halo 3.

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.800
He's a 15-year-old, by the way.

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:49.160
And it says they took his copy of Halo 3 away, mature rated

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:54.160
title, after they had previously refused him from

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.120
playing the game.

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:59.240
And so he basically told them, I have a surprise for you,

01:50:59.240 --> 01:50:59.880
close your eyes.

01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:01.040
And he shot them both in the face.

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:02.960
Oh my god.

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:03.760
That's terrible.

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.240
With a taco.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.120
No, I'm just kidding.

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.280
That's awful.

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.720
That is so bad.

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:09.800
I got, sorry, I have to say this.

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:11.200
I know this is like a horrible story.

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.520
I have to go back to the taco thing, because this is one we

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.640
could actually laugh at, right?

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.920
The other ones are terrible, right?

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:19.200
But comments from chat, D5T says, if I went to jail every

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:22.600
time I threw food at my mom.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:25.320
And I'm thinking, my mom and I did get into a fight over

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.480
M&M's once, so that's what I'm sure of.

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.160
I remember, you didn't throw them though.

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:28.640
You broke them to death.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:31.000
I didn't throw them, but it was a different story.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.320
Um, Deakman says, I see nothing wrong with tacos

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:34.440
getting thrown at my face.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.960
Like, if you open, it could be like a game.

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.640
If you open your mouth, try to catch them.

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:42.600
OK, but here is the huge, huge news.

01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:46.760
Apparently, one of our listeners does not live that

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.160
far from the taco person.

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:48.600
Really?

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.280
And is going to try and get them on the show.

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:53.240
Oh, that'd be awesome.

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:54.680
Oh, be careful, dude.

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:58.320
We're going to have to bump the Tax Town people to get the

01:51:58.320 --> 01:51:59.960
taco assailant on the show.

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.200
I must speak to the taco kid.

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.880
Keep your mouth open, dude, in case he throws any tacos.

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:07.000
Just be careful.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
OK, and then here's the best part about

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.080
the halo murder thing.

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:13.400
Apparently, the judge, James Burge, told the courtroom,

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:17.280
it's my firm belief as a human being, and not just as a

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:22.880
jurist, that Daniel does suffer from a serious defect

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:24.000
of the mind.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.720
And apparently, believes that games are somehow

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:33.360
involved, that he says, I firmly believe Daniel had no

01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:36.880
idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:39.840
his parents, they would be dead forever.

01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.320
That he was so far into the Halo 3 world that he separated

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:45.560
himself from reality.

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.000
Would he be like that, calling from earlier?

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.760
So would they like respawn, like parents respawn?

01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.760
He'd be like that, calling from earlier.

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:57.720
You know, it died and came back to life.

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.040
Mom?

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:00.360
Oh my god.

01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:05.840
This is like there's a special place in hell where

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:07.000
this show is waiting.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.520
I don't know who's stupider, that kid or that juror.

01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:12.600
No, that's a judge.

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:14.600
I mean, wow.

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.440
OK, this part.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:19.840
Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.480
I mean, I'm sure that kid's stupid, but I don't know if

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.680
he's that stupid.

01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:27.160
No, I think he knew exactly what he was doing.

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:30.640
But now he figured out I got to go to jail forever.

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:31.880
I'm insane.

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:36.800
Please don't kill me in the face.

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:39.120
In the face.

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:40.520
I don't know.

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:41.480
I don't even know what to say.

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.320
This isn't even really a story about video

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:44.320
games at this point.

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:47.000
This kid obviously has like a ton of issues.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.600
Can we just talk about the Taco Kid some more?

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.040
Yes, the Taco Kid's awesome.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:57.120
But I just wanted to point out that here live in studio,

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:02.120
I'm now the snickerdoodle assailant.

01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.120
Open your mouth.

01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.600
Oh, you wasted my cookie.

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.560
Pick it up and eat it.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.840
Spin on my boobie.

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:08.920
I'll eat your cookie.

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.480
I threw a snickerdoodle and it hit Irene in the boob.

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:22.000
It was deliciously painful.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.160
All right, look, we're going to dedicate a certain segment

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:26.320
of our show we do here.

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:26.840
Love you.

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:28.880
We're going to dedicate a certain part of our show

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.960
here we do every week to these guys who

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.240
are ruining the image of video gamers

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:35.160
everywhere with their stupidity.

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.120
And it's a segment called the FUs of the Week.

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:56.840
Since we don't have Dark Sakura tonight to start us off we'll let Loki start us off with the FUs of the Week today.

01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:03.360
Fucking Rockstar Games for making a really crappy port of Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC.

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:08.640
There's no reason whatsoever that the game should work for a while then all of a sudden just stop.

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.920
I didn't install anything.

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:10.960
I didn't change anything.

01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:15.440
It just said I'm not working no more and just stop working.

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:16.520
Now I reinstall it.

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:20.960
I've uninstalled everything including secure ROM, all my video drivers,

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:24.720
every little bit of crap that would possibly affect this game.

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:26.560
I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it.

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.280
Nothing.

01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:29.720
It just broke in.

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:30.360
Bullshit.

01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:33.000
Why should I pay for an actual game and have it not work?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:33.520
That's it.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.840
Never do it again.

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:35.160
I know.

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:35.760
That's ridiculous.

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:38.960
I am never buying a PC game ever again.

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.720
Especially Rockstar Games.

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.920
Never again.

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:43.840
Don't do it.

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:49.760
My FU of the Week, if you're done, my FU of the Week goes to my tooth because it hurts.

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:51.240
And I have to go to the dentist tomorrow.

01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.000
And I don't like going to the dentist.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.760
I think I mentioned this on the show before because it's like going to a used car salesman.

01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.840
Because then they're going to tell me, oh, you need to have this done.

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.360
Oh, and by the way, you need to get this done.

01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:00.440
You need to replace this crown.

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:01.360
It's going to cost this much money.

01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:02.160
And it's like, ugh.

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.400
I thought you had an awesome dentist, though.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:05.040
No.

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:05.680
Do that crap.

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:06.760
No.

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:07.360
No.

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:07.840
OK.

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.040
You want to hear something funny?

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:09.400
What?

01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:12.360
I'm a horrible, I'm horrible when it comes to oral hygiene.

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:13.960
Like, they tell me to floss.

01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.040
I'm like, yeah, I'll floss.

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.320
And I totally forget.

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:19.120
But OK, so yeah, nobody flosses.

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.120
So anyways, they keep telling me, yeah, you got to floss because your gums are all, you know,

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:25.360
they're going to get fucked up and that kind of stuff.

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:27.720
So I haven't flossed for a year since I saw them last.

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.400
And they said that it looked better.

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.120
I'm like, have you been flossing?

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.680
I'm like, yeah, sure, I've been flossing all the time.

01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:34.440
Oh, well, it looks like it's doing a good job.

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:35.600
So yes, they're full of shit.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.560
That's basically it.

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:39.920
I've seen more unicorns than people flossing.

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.040
Like, nobody flosses.

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:45.800
SSJ100Matt wants to point out that his dad's a dentist, but he's an honest dentist.

01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:48.360
Look, if I lived in New York City, I would happily go to your dad.

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.800
Like, I need a friend who's a dentist or who goes to the dentist.

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:52.640
I have a friend who's a dentist.

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:53.200
Really?

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.520
Yeah, he's starting his own practice.

01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:57.960
I want to go see them because I want to go see somebody I trust.

01:56:57.960 --> 01:56:59.080
Yeah.

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.000
You can go to a dental school.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:01.680
Blah.

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:02.440
Blah.

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:03.400
At least they're honest.

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.240
That's what poor people do.

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:07.080
I'm just kidding.

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:08.640
At least we ain't paying for any shit.

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.440
Look, we've all been there, Victoria.

01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:11.840
We've all been there, OK?

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.960
You're a young 21 still.

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.120
You're in that phase.

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.680
A young, beautiful, single 21-year-old gal.

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:18.880
With big titties.

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:19.360
Yes.

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:20.200
She's the one.

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:23.240
Quit trying to pimp me.

01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:26.400
I want to say, there is somebody in chat right now with the nickname that

01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:27.800
says, I love Victoria.

01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:32.920
Aw, I hurt you too, whoever you are.

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.960
All right, so my F.U. of the week goes to my tooth.

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:36.720
Victoria, do you have any F.U.s of the week?

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:40.840
My F.U. of the week is to the person who didn't turn my keys in.

01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:43.320
Whoever found my keys at work and didn't turn them

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:46.040
in since I've been locked out of my apartment for the past three fucking

01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.720
days.

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:48.240
Not really.

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:51.280
That's the biggest F.U. of the week that I have.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:54.280
And to my phone that's flashing an evil red color at me

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:56.240
because it needs to be charged.

01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:56.720
Uh-oh.

01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.320
That's it.

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.680
And Rice Princess, do you have any F.U.s?

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:03.520
Yeah, F.U. to you for hitting my titty.

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.160
You liked it.

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.400
You wasted a snickerdoodle.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:06.360
You liked it a little bit.

01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.560
I'll give it to John when he gets back.

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:10.960
I'll put it on a plate and say, we saved you a snickerdoodle.

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:14.720
Just brush off the little bit of dust and pee pee on it.

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.480
Oh my god, if he ever finds out it touched my boob, he'll die.

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:21.080
He'd be like, oh my god, I had a woman's breast in my mouth.

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:22.960
I'm going to put it back on the plate when no one's looking.

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:26.640
And then it's like a game of Russian snickerdoodle roulette.

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.080
Yeah, you see.

01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.600
One of these was on Irene's booby.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:33.300
Do you want to eat one and take a chance?

01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:34.600
It's the one that's dead to you.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:38.120
Or do you want to possibly inadvertently lick her boob?

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.320
Let's not talk about this.

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.840
Yeah, let's not.

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:41.760
All right.

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:44.040
Anyway, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:44.680
on that note.

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:46.400
So let's get back into some gaming news.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.840
And this is actually some big news that came out this week,

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:50.200
a patent that was revealed.

01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:52.200
Now this is what I was kind of talking to Victoria

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.960
a little bit about before, is that she

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.440
was talking about how video games get too hard

01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:58.280
and she gets too frustrated and throws a controller, right?

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:02.320
Here's what's interesting, is that apparently Miyamoto

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.680
has filed a patent.

01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:06.140
And I don't know if it's him or like his company or whatever,

01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:08.000
but basically Nintendo has filed the patent.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:11.960
And it has been discovered for a computable readable storage

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:12.520
medium.

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:19.800
But what the medium is is basically kind of a hint system.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:22.120
And the game that they kind of show pictures of

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:25.880
is a work in progress called Legend of O.O., which could

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:28.320
possibly be a Legend of Zelda game.

01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:29.920
But here's the interesting thing.

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.920
This patent is very, very, very wordy, kind of goes on.

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.200
It talks about these different gameplay features

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:39.040
that include hint videos that are actually already there

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.240
inside the game that would unlock,

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.880
if you've been stuck on a puzzle for so long,

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:46.180
then a hint video will show up.

01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:49.480
A mode called the digest, which will actually just show

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:52.520
the game's cinematics and gameplay sequences just

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:53.400
as a movie.

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:55.600
And you can take control at any point you want.

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:57.560
And then a scene menu, which lets

01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:01.120
you choose exactly where you want to go into the story.

02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:04.760
So it's kind of like this extreme hybrid

02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:08.800
of mixing a video game with DVD features, almost.

02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:10.760
Kind of interesting.

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:12.480
And then you just add on to this the fact

02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:15.040
that Miyamoto has said before that he

02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.260
wants to make more Zelda Wii titles more

02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:20.040
accessible to a broad audience.

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.800
Could this actually be something that they

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:25.400
are going to implement in a future Zelda title?

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:26.640
Possibly.

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:27.960
Well, what do you think of that?

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:31.840
I mean, is that dumbing down the game too much?

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.080
Is that taking the game out of the video game?

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:42.120
I think it's kind of, for us, the hardcore gamers,

02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:44.520
the gamers who've been playing games for all of our life,

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.520
we're probably not going to be big fans of that.

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.600
But yeah, it's going to bring new people into games.

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.800
So let me ask Victoria, even though she's

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.720
tapping away on the laptop, it's somebody else right now.

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.080
What if they had a game, like one of these games

02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:58.440
you'd get really frustrated at.

02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:59.920
But you could just say you throw the controller

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:00.840
because it's too hard.

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:02.520
What if suddenly the game said, hey, it

02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:03.480
looks like you're stuck.

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.760
Let me show you a video of how to get past this part.

02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:08.280
Would that make the game more appealing to you?

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:09.320
It would probably help.

02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:10.520
But I'd probably get annoyed because I

02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:12.320
wouldn't be able to be like, what the hell?

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:13.480
What's going on?

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:14.400
How do I get up there?

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:15.280
You know what I mean?

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:17.040
That's usually my problem with games

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:20.520
is I have to get up somewhere and, you know.

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:22.360
What if the game said, press this button

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:24.080
and I'll take you past this point?

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:24.960
Then I'll play.

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.920
Then I'd be like, all right, bring it, bitch.

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.300
What would draw you to that, though?

02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:32.200
What would try to play the game if there's no challenge?

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.360
I'm sorry, I just read something funny about the thing.

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:38.240
I don't know, what was the question?

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:40.080
What would draw you, if you could just

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:42.600
hit the button and skip that part to get up the ledge

02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:44.640
or get to where you need to go, fast forward or whatever.

02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:46.180
What's the draw to the game to you?

02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:48.200
Well then, I just think it'd make it easier

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.200
for me to play it, because I'm not very video game savvy,

02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.440
as I've said already.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:58.260
But I just think it would make it easier for me to play it.

02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:00.840
I think me and the 4-year-olds who

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:03.240
can't play video games very well,

02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.200
I'm assuming there are 4-year-olds out there who can't

02:02:05.200 --> 02:02:08.380
play video games very well.

02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:11.040
But yeah, I think that's the biggest appeal,

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:14.160
I could just say, oh, you too can play video games.

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.560
You don't have to be as awesome as Rob or Matt or Irene to play video games.

02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:21.360
Which is funny because people assume because we host this show that we're actually good at video games,

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:22.360
but that's so not true.

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:23.460
I've seen you play video games.

02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:25.060
You've seen me play Rock Band.

02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:27.260
Oh yeah, you're pretty- he's pretty badass at Rock Band, guys.

02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:29.960
But here's the thing, here's- here's- I don't know.

02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.560
No, Loki, please, I'd like to hear your-

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:33.160
Here's my issue with it.

02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:37.560
If the game is designed well in the beginning, you shouldn't have problems figuring out what you need to do,

02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:41.360
because it gradually teaches you the skills in the game that you need to learn,

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.160
and teaches you how to solve different puzzles, and then says go do it.

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:49.160
And you should know how to do it if it's been done right.

02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:53.360
Now, if you're gonna put this together- put together a game that's like poorly done,

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.960
then yeah, you're gonna need this stupid cheat system and stuff.

02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:01.960
And I think it's a waste of time anyways, because it would be like showing somebody how-

02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.860
Okay, here's a video of how you do this.

02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:05.660
And they're like, huh?

02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:06.960
Okay, hit this button, then go past it.

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.260
Great, okay, now I'm at another scene that's too hard.

02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:11.260
Oh, I'm gonna hit this button, then go past it again.

02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:12.160
Read a book!

02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:12.960
Go read a book!

02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:13.960
Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.760
It's like, God, I don't want to invest time to figure out what the story is.

02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:18.660
Let me just read the end and figure out what happens.

02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:20.960
Oh, and then it ruins it for me.

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:22.260
It'd be just like Animal Crossing.

02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:25.760
Oh, I don't want to wait here and, you know, pay off Tom Nook's mortgage or whatever.

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:27.560
Let me just, you know, cheat and have lots of money.

02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:30.060
Look, now I have no purpose to this game anymore.

02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:34.760
Which is, by the way, what happened with Animal Crossing, but I had no purpose to begin with anyways, so.

02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:36.260
Um.

02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:39.960
It- I think it's a horrible idea, and I see what they're trying to do,

02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:42.960
because they're still, you know, having this dilemma.

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:48.060
How do we sell games to people that only want to play Wii Sports, and now Wii Fit?

02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:50.160
How do we sell games to them?

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.060
And they don't know.

02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:55.860
And this is a problem, because they're never gonna figure this out, this console generation,

02:03:55.860 --> 02:04:00.660
and they're gonna- I have a feeling they're gonna sell millions of systems,

02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:03.360
but they're not gonna sell millions of games.

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:06.360
And that's a problem, because, you know, the only things they're selling right now

02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:09.160
are the things that they're making hard to find.

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:13.960
Because, trust me, I'm sorry, Mario Kart's been out since last April.

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:17.760
It's- we're coming upon almost a year of it being out.

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.460
There's no fucking reason that should be a shortage right now.

02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:24.160
It's a game and a goddamn steering wheel that's a piece of plastic.

02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:26.360
Shit, they make plastic toys like crazy.

02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:27.760
They're in supermarkets everywhere.

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:29.760
It's a piece of fucking plastic!

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:30.960
I mean, come on!

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:34.160
So there's no reason that this stuff is-

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:35.960
they're selling out of it because they can't make enough-

02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.960
no, they're not making enough on purpose, so that there's not enough on the market.

02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:43.160
So demand's always high, so people are always looking for it.

02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:45.560
So Wii Fit's always popular, because people think,

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:48.360
oh my god, it's out there, but once they buy it, like I do,

02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.960
you go, oh my god, I'm not using this thing.

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:52.560
Like Rob did.

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:55.360
Okay. I have an argument for it.

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.360
Okay.

02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:02.160
Number one, we have not only strategy guides,

02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:07.160
but we have a huge website dedicated to FAQs and walkthroughs and stuff like that.

02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:09.960
So obviously, people are going to need help with games.

02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:11.360
That's why those exist.

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.760
Number two, there are going to be parts of games.

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:15.960
Like not every part of every game is hard,

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:17.960
but there are going to be very hard parts.

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:21.160
I remember a part in Resident Evil 4 that I just could not get past,

02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:22.760
and I wish I could have done that.

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:26.160
Just press a button and just gotten through that one small section of the game,

02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.160
and then continued.

02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:32.960
So, like, I personally probably would not use it to just skip through every part of the game,

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:35.960
but if I have a chance to get through a hard part of the game,

02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:37.560
bring it on. I'd like it.

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:43.160
This has been done before, you know, not necessarily to the fact that there's stuff that you can,

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:47.160
you know, skip parts of the game, but Alone in the Dark, the game that came out,

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:51.360
unfortunately it was crap, but it came out in chapters, basically, in this game,

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:55.160
and you can start the game at any chapter and go from there.

02:05:55.160 --> 02:05:57.960
So, say, oh, this is too hard, skip ahead,

02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:01.560
and it will fill you in on what happened in the last chapter, and you just kind of go from there.

02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:06.160
I don't, the problem is, though, is the only way you're going to get good at games

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:08.960
is from playing games and being challenged to think for yourself,

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:11.360
because if you're just sitting there going, oh, I don't get it,

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:15.160
and then the game solves the problem for you, you're not going to learn anything.

02:06:15.160 --> 02:06:16.160
That is true.

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:19.560
And, you know, and that may turn away people from playing those games,

02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:24.760
but you're not going to buy the game in the first place if you don't, aren't remotely interested in it.

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:27.760
It's like someone's spoiling the ending for, you know, a movie or something.

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:33.160
Like, I, you know, why is, you know, like, for example, like, The Sixth Sense or something like that,

02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:37.360
you know, you know, why, why is it that, you know, his wife doesn't see him?

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.360
What's going on?

02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:39.560
It's because he's dead!

02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:42.960
You know, it's like, if someone, if someone spoiled that for you,

02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:46.960
so that you figure out the puzzle there, it ruins it.

02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:47.760
That's the thing.

02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:53.760
Well, see, okay, gamers like us, regular gamers that have hand-eye coordination and all that stuff,

02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:56.360
we're not going to want to skip over the story parts.

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:58.360
We're going to want to play the game as is.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:02.560
But there are people who suck, just playing flat-out suck at video games.

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:07.360
They just can't make their character jump or whatever, you know, they can't put two and two together.

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:12.760
They're going to want to be kind of like a, you know how people are like spectators when it comes to video games?

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:15.160
They like to watch other people play a video game.

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:17.960
Yeah, that's going to be part of the appeal too.

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:20.760
They can feel like they're going through the video game themselves,

02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:23.360
but have to skip over the hard things that they can't do.

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:28.360
One of the features of this game was actually watching basically the gameplay itself.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:31.360
I have to say my piece, because I haven't said anything on this yet.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.360
Do your piece.

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:34.360
And I haven't stated my opinion.

02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:38.360
And you know I'm one of Nintendo's biggest critics as of like 2008 and everything.

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.360
Nintendo's kind of been pissing me off a lot lately.

02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:44.360
That being said, I actually think this is a really good idea.

02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:50.360
For Nintendo and its audience, I think this is a really good idea.

02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:55.360
As long as they make a feature to turn it off and you hit the nail on the head.

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:56.360
Exactly what I was thinking.

02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:00.360
This is for those people that like to watch other people play video games.

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:03.360
Because they're too intimidated, they don't want to really play them themselves.

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.360
Because of the fact that they feel like they suck at video games.

02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.360
They can't get past these hard parts.

02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:09.360
They want to just get past this stuff.

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:14.360
And I think a game like Zelda especially, that has such pretty awesome cinematics.

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.360
You know, these things that you get into.

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:19.360
The towns, you know, and the story behind these games.

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:21.360
I think it actually is going to work really well.

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:24.360
I kind of think about how many times that we've kind of hoped.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:27.360
That there was a game like Final Fantasy X or something.

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.360
Where you could just like, I don't want to grind.

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:30.360
I don't want to do this dungeon.

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.360
I just want to run past all the monsters.

02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:35.360
I want to get my, I'm going to equip the run boots on my character.

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:37.360
So I can just run really fast through the dungeon.

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.360
So I don't have to grind here.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.360
Because I just want to get to the next part of the story.

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:44.360
Do you know how many games I've quit because I couldn't get past one certain part?

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:46.360
Fucking Alundra.

02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:48.360
Oh my God, that game pissed me off.

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.360
I spent so long trying to do one puzzle.

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.360
I could just never get it, so I quit the game.

02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:53.360
But here's the problem.

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:54.360
My thing though.

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:55.360
One other thing.

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:58.360
I think as we start to blur the line even more and more.

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:00.360
As games become more and more realistic between games and movies.

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:03.360
This actually kind of seems like a logical progression to me.

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:07.360
Is that these video games are slowly becoming Blu-ray movies in a way.

02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:08.360
It's fascinating.

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:11.360
And again, for the hardcore gamers that can be a little off putting at first.

02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:17.360
But I don't think this necessarily means that games that you and I enjoy are going to go away.

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:20.360
I think this is just something they're going to start in Nintendo.

02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:22.360
And it's a very Nintendo thing to do.

02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:23.360
It's not surprising at all.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.360
Okay, sorry Matt.

02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:28.360
My thing is, is that a fault of the fact that you can't finish something?

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:32.360
Is that a fault of the person or is that a fault of the game design?

02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.360
I think it's a fault of the game design.

02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:37.360
The fact that they made that many random battles.

02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:43.360
You know, they tweaked it in future Final Fantasy games where there aren't that many random battles.

02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:46.360
And they've gone back and fixed different things like that.

02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.360
Because people complained about it and they listened to it.

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:53.360
But I don't think that necessarily, you know, it's a bad thing that there should be some difficulty in there.

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:55.360
Because it makes it worthwhile to figure it out.

02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:59.360
Instead of just like, if you want to just go from story to story to story.

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:01.360
Seriously, go read a book. Go watch a movie.

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.360
Well, of course.

02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:04.360
You know, but they're making it an option for you.

02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:06.360
Like, yeah, you know, work at it.

02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:10.360
If you really want a sense of accomplishment from beating this game, do it normal.

02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:12.360
But for those people who don't want to, they're giving them the option to.

02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:16.360
I just have a problem though with, you know, someone pushing a button, having the game play itself.

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:17.360
You know, beginning to end.

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:20.360
And just, what's the point?

02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:23.360
Because here's what you can't do with a movie, Loki.

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:25.360
And there's going to be some people like this.

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:28.360
All they're going to do in a Zelda game is go around and talk to the villagers.

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:31.360
And then like fast forward through the action sequences and the dungeons of the game.

02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:34.360
But they're going to feel like a part of the game.

02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:35.360
And they feel that more emotional attachment.

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.360
More interactive.

02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:39.360
Because it was more interactive and they just walked around and talked to villagers.

02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:40.360
And that's all they ever did.

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:42.360
And they're going to be like, this is the greatest game I've ever played.

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.360
And you know what's also awesome about that?

02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.360
The fact that they're going to be done with the game now and they have to buy something else.

02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.360
Because that's what Nintendo wants to do.

02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.360
That's their own choice.

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:52.360
That's their prerogative.

02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:53.360
They can do that if they want to.

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:54.360
If they want to spend their money.

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:59.360
And you can go on to TheMovieSpoiler.net and look at the ending to all your movies without having to pay $100.

02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:00.360
Alright, fine.

02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:01.360
Or whatever it's called.

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:02.360
I'm going to say this here and now.

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.360
This game, whenever it does come out with this feature, I'm not buying it.

02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:06.360
I'm sorry.

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:08.360
This feature right here ruined it for me.

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:11.360
And the fact that they're putting it in this game, I am not buying this game.

02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:12.360
Even though it's optional?

02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:13.360
Even if it's optional.

02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:14.360
I don't give a shit.

02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:15.360
I'm not buying it.

02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:16.360
Because you know what?

02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:22.360
If they want to design a game that's more appealing to the casual audience, they need to design that game for the casual audience.

02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:25.360
It's just like the EA Sports games that they put out.

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:29.360
The really stupid, easy, you can play them with the remote.

02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:34.360
They're really stripped down versions of the game because people can't figure out the complex controls.

02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:35.360
Well I'm sorry.

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:36.360
You know what?

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:40.360
There have been plenty of kids, plenty of people that have figured out the Xbox controllers.

02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.360
Figured out the Playstation 2 controllers.

02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:43.360
I'd like to meet them.

02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:45.360
Figured out how to use the Wii remote.

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.360
There's people that still don't know how to use the Wii remote.

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:52.360
Unless you come out with a game that's a fucking controller that's a big giant button that says,

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:53.360
Push me.

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:55.360
And even then they're not going to figure it out.

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:58.360
They're going to throw it on the floor and go, I don't know how to play this.

02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:00.360
These people do not need to be playing games.

02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:02.360
And I don't care if you want to introduce them in the games.

02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.360
They think they need to be playing games but they do not need to be playing games.

02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:09.360
And keep them away from my goddamn games.

02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:13.360
Do you care to make a wager on how much this game will sell?

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:16.360
No, I am not making a wager.

02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:21.360
Because it will be a Zelda game and some will be like, Oh my god, Zelda, go buy it.

02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.360
Even if it's crap, it could be Zelda Cribbage or something.

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:27.360
And they'll be like, Oh my god, I got to buy this, it's Zelda.

02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.360
Oh my god, Zelda and they have stuff in it.

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:34.360
The chat room is setting off the Loki rant alarm.

02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:38.360
Goldanthro in chat says, Wii 2.0, push me.

02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.360
Rice Princess.

02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:50.360
Oh no, I was just going to say, the way I see it, I liken it to having an easy, normal, and hard mode in a game.

02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:54.360
There's going to be like, dumb fuck mode.

02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:57.360
Don't know how to do anything in the game, just going to watch it play itself.

02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:58.360
Whatever, you know.

02:12:58.360 --> 02:12:59.360
Just another mode.

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.360
I'm not surprised.

02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:01.360
It's the Wii.

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:02.360
You know, great.

02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:04.360
They're going to have this feature, but I bet you anything they're going to be able to turn it off.

02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:05.360
And you know why?

02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:06.360
Because that's a feature.

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:09.360
And Nintendo doesn't add features that people want.

02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:12.360
Okay, we're getting back into that, Matt.

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:14.360
We don't need to have that argument on this show.

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:15.360
No, seriously.

02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:17.360
They're not going to have it.

02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.360
Ah, whatever.

02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:19.360
I'm done.

02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.360
There's a second half to this I want Loki to get into.

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.360
Yes, there's a second half.

02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:28.360
Apparently, the game developers were asked to kind of comment on this.

02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:30.360
And they have different things.

02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:36.360
For example, Ben Matz from Ubisoft, he was saying, you know, he read through it quickly.

02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:41.360
Not surely they fully understand what it is yet.

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:48.360
But it says it makes sense to them in a purely linear game, but as soon as they get to sort of like a sandbox game,

02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:56.360
or an evenly or remotely open-ended game, the number of variables would seem to invalidate the potential of this system.

02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:01.360
But I think he's talking about something that would actually play through the game for you or something like that.

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.360
But Ubisoft just put out a game that definitely had easy mode on.

02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:07.360
You don't die in Prince of Persia, ever.

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:08.360
Yeah.

02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:13.360
It's kind of interesting because Ubisoft kind of already started going this direction where, you know, you don't die.

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:15.360
The chick always saves you.

02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.360
And in every battle, at least that I've played so far, it pretty much tells you how to fight it.

02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:21.360
And you just press buttons and it does cool stuff.

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.360
But, like, it's not a bad game.

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:24.360
It's really not.

02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.360
I have a lot of fun with the new Prince of Persia.

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:28.360
Can I read this in chat real quick?

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:29.360
Yeah.

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:30.360
I'm sorry, this is too good.

02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:33.360
GS68 says, I guess talking about, you know, getting irritated at games,

02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:34.360
My face turns beet red.

02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:36.360
I throw my controller on the ground, start swearing.

02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.360
Fucking game.

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:38.360
Long chains.

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:40.360
Swear to never play a shooting game again.

02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:42.360
And then SakuraMax follows up and says,

02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:47.360
And then you throw a taco at someone.

02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:54.360
Todd Howard from Bethesda says that, you know, most people stop playing certain games because they get frustrated or confused by what the game wants them to do.

02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:57.360
It becomes work and frustration as opposed to play time.

02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:01.360
This idea clearly tries to alleviate that.

02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:07.360
It's much like passing the controller to someone that knows the game really well so that you can move ahead or simply enjoy the story.

02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:15.360
It's a classic challenge or entertain issue that designers will often deal with.

02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:17.360
Yeah.

02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.360
And then finally, let's see here.

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.360
Jonathan Blow from the creator of Braid says,

02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:25.360
Based on just reading your posting, I don't know.

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:31.360
I mean, it's an okay idea for a developer to have a way to show you through various parts of the game, I guess.

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:34.360
To show you the side quests that you missed or whatever.

02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:36.360
I'd like to see someone try that.

02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:43.360
But as a general, what was it, paradigm for playing games, there are a lot of problems.

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:46.360
The defining characteristics of a game is that you play it.

02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:55.360
And if in order for games to be accessible to a wide audience, we need to make sure that so that most people can skip over the playing part of it,

02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:03.360
then what that really means is that our medium sucks.

02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:15.360
And if you have to elude the basic property of your medium to make experiences in the medium desirable, then the medium itself is questionable at a very deep level.

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:21.360
Apparently our stream went down for the live listeners. The podcast listeners won't notice the thing because we've been recording the whole time.

02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:23.360
But our stream went down in the middle of you reading that.

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:27.360
Like, I don't know what's going on tonight. There's some weird things with our internet stream.

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:32.360
But somebody in the chat room had to say, who threw a taco at the stream?

02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:37.360
Sorry, that's never going to get old. I'm sorry to derail the other thing you're talking about.

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:44.360
The live listeners didn't even hear what you were just saying, which is unfortunate, but kind of some varied opinions from developers.

02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:50.360
Yeah. I mean, definitely it's all over the place, but I think it's something that's only going to be used in Nintendo games anyway.

02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:52.360
It's not something that they're requiring, I don't think.

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:57.360
I wonder if any of these developers are secretly already working on something for this new system. That's what I'm curious about.

02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.360
I doubt it.

02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:00.360
Do you think this is a Nintendo-only thing?

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:04.360
I think this is something they're going to push, and it's probably going to be in one game, and I don't think you'll see it ever again.

02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:15.360
I really don't think... I mean, honestly, with this in here, the problem is that we're expecting this to be implemented in a Zelda game.

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:21.360
And really, are you going to be able to tell what kind of an impact this had on a Zelda game?

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:25.360
I mean, this is a title that's going to sell like crazy anyways.

02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:31.360
I mean, I would think that they would want this something on, you know, something that doesn't sell very well.

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.360
Like, even Mario Galaxy didn't sell that well.

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:39.360
You know, maybe something like that is where we can see an actual impact on this, but with a Zelda, it's just going to sell like crazy and be like,

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:42.360
Oh, it worked! You know, I mean, it's just stupid.

02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:45.360
I don't know. I don't think it's...

02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:52.360
They're just going to sell tons of copies anyways, because people are dumb, and they'll buy whatever people tell them is good.

02:17:52.360 --> 02:18:00.360
And Zelda is going to get tens out of ten, because there's fanboys out there that are reviewing that stuff.

02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:06.360
And even though Twilight Princess, in my opinion, I don't think that's a ten out of ten game, or not even a nine out of ten game.

02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:09.360
It was okay. It was the first Zelda game.

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:15.360
Actually, the GameCube one, or not the GameCube, the Nintendo 64 ones, I didn't care for too much either.

02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:26.360
I just was not interested. It just didn't hold my interest, and that's sad, because I'm really interested in Zelda games.

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:30.360
Yeah, but they don't have an objective perspective on the game.

02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.360
Yeah, I think that's it. Perfectly.

02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:35.360
You know, there's going to be like, Grand Theft Auto. Oh, ten out of ten.

02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:37.360
You know, Gears of War. Ten out of ten!

02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:39.360
Yeah, they don't even have to work on a hit anymore. It's guaranteed.

02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:44.360
I mean, that's what you do. You build up a franchise, and you get to the point where it's like, you know, you can do whatever, and people are still going to buy it.

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:45.360
I don't know.

02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:46.360
It's huge.

02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:49.360
I'm really curious to see what the listeners think of all this casual stuff.

02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:55.360
I haven't seen a whole lot in chat, probably because the stream went down, but I will hopefully see some emails later on.

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:59.360
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, you know, for next week or something would be great.

02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:03.360
We will get into tonight's mailbag. Well, how about right now?

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:04.360
Want to open up the mailbag?

02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:05.360
Well, alright then.

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:07.360
Check out some emails from the listeners.

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:08.360
Sure!

02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:19.360
Every week we invite you to send us emails at Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, and usually DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and reads the emails.

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:22.360
However, she's not here tonight, so I am filling in.

02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:27.360
And we actually have quite a few emails tonight, so I want to try and get through these as fast as I can.

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:30.360
Let's read this first email. It's from Chaz.

02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:39.360
Hey, OLR gang. I'm a long-time listener of the show, but it's my first time writing in. I listen to you all every Monday at my desk while hard at work here in the frozen tundra known as Chicago.

02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:44.360
I listen to a lot of the other video game podcasts out there, and OLR is by far the best. Well, thank you.

02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:49.360
I don't really have much to say in the way of video games today, but consider this my love letter to the show.

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:51.360
How hard does OLR rock? Let me count the ways.

02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:55.360
Number three, real gamers with real opinions. Nothing commercial here.

02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:56.360
Thank you, that's one of the things we pride ourselves on.

02:19:56.360 --> 02:20:01.360
Yeah, we're definitely not commercial based on the comments and crap that we've-

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:02.360
Brought to you by Nintendo.

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:05.360
By the way, have you checked out Game Tap this week? No, just kidding.

02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:11.360
Number two, awesome segments. Classic Game of the Week and Fus of the Week rock my world. Well, thank you.

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:19.360
Number one, good friends with great chemistry. Loki with his blistering honesty, Jamie's hilarious interludes, and Rob's fun-loving and sincere take on gaming culture.

02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:23.360
These are just a few of the reasons I am and will continue to be an OLR fanboy.

02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:27.360
Also, on a personal note, I'd like to give a special shout out to Rob.

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:29.360
You think I'd pay this guy to write-

02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:31.360
Yeah, you wrote this to yourself.

02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:33.360
No, come over here and read it for sure.

02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:39.360
I think it's so great and so important to have an openly gay gamer's voice being heard in the community.

02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:51.360
As a gay man myself, you know as well as I do how severely underrepresented and occasionally maligned gay sexuality has been portrayed through the games we've played and how rampant homophobia continues to be in the online gaming sphere.

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:59.360
Thanks for letting listeners know your stand on these issues. It means a lot to me and also to those who are unable for whatever reason to speak up for themselves. Keep up the great work.

02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:01.360
Ooh, is he single?

02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:03.360
And not a minor?

02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:05.360
Shush. Shush.

02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:07.360
No, that was very nice.

02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:13.360
You know, it's letters like those that make me feel good about doing this show for free for seven years, honestly.

02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.360
Oh, tear, tear.

02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:26.360
You know, when Wendy says it's right, it's tough. It's really tough sometimes because, you know, the nice thing is being gay is getting more and more accepted. We're getting there.

02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:31.360
You know, even though Prop 8 in California didn't pass, it was just- I know, I know, Victoria, don't get me started.

02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:37.360
It was a very slim margin compared to Prop 22 of several years ago. We're getting there.

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:40.360
You know, more and more, especially in the youth, no more gay people, what have you.

02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:46.360
But it's funny because in the gay world, it's like, oh, you play video games? That's like a kid thing.

02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:51.360
You know, why don't you listen to Madonna or do fashion shows? Like seriously, you know, like it's hard.

02:21:51.360 --> 02:22:00.360
Like there was a long time where I didn't feel comfortable when I met guys for the first time, like telling them, yeah, I do an online radio show about video games on the weekends because it's like, whoa, nerd alert.

02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:02.360
But now I don't give a shit.

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:15.360
I'm to that point where I've kind of seen there's enough out there that, you know, there's people out there that are going to like me for both elements, if that makes sense.

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:18.360
Anyhow, I don't want to get too into it.

02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.360
We can relate to you, Rott.

02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:20.360
How so?

02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:31.360
Because girl and girl gamers. I mean, like, you know, a lot of them are kind of, I guess, not really tomboyish, but they kind of shun like female convention.

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:36.360
You know, they're not all of them are bottle blondes that get their nails done every day and wear a lot of makeup.

02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.360
So it's kind of the same.

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:39.360
Interesting perspective.

02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:40.360
Yeah, true.

02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:41.360
True.

02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.360
All right, let's get to another email.

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:49.360
And OK, this kind of ties into a story we reported on earlier, but obviously we weren't here last week.

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.360
Spazinator writes in.

02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:55.360
Hey, everyone, I thought I'd email you folks about some news that I received the other day that you might want to share.

02:22:55.360 --> 02:23:03.360
I have heard via both one up dot com green speak dot com and G4 that Ziff Davis has sold the one up network at sites along with EGM to UGO.

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:07.360
Not to be confused with Yu-Gi-Oh for some undisclosed sum.

02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:09.360
Subsequently, UGO is fine.

02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:17.360
Now I want to say Yu-Gi-Oh has fired approximately 30 one up employees, including some of the more well-known popularity and popular personalities.

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:19.360
Additionally, EGM has been officially killed off.

02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:26.360
And although no one mentioned specifically, it looks like the audio and video podcasts have been axed as well, including one up FM, Retronauts and so on and so on.

02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:31.360
On a personal note, I really feel bad for those that got the ax earlier this week are the ones I recognize.

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:38.360
I know they produce top notch material, whether it be for the sites, podcasts or the magazines, and inject their own personality into said material to keep it from going stale.

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:39.360
I hope for the best for them.

02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:46.360
But given the particularly craptastic economy as of late, I'm afraid there's the potential they may leave the video games journalism biz.

02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:48.360
If that's the case, the industry would suffer a great loss.

02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:52.360
Additionally, it really sickens me that they killed off EGM, a long as hell running magazine.

02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:57.360
Isn't it bad enough that OPM was killed in 06 and game for Windows earlier this year?

02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:00.360
I mean, come on, websites are fine and dandy, but magazines still have a place though.

02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:04.360
Case in point, which would you rather bring to the can, a mag or a laptop?

02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:05.360
Or worse, yes, a desktop.

02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:07.360
Wow, it's like this guy read my mind from earlier.

02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:08.360
That's amazing.

02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:14.360
Not only that, but for some people such as myself, we like the feel of holding a mag in our hands.

02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:17.360
While you're in the bathroom, you talk about holding things in your hands.

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.360
And you know what, if you run out of toilet paper...

02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:20.360
Shut up, shut up.

02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:26.360
And sometimes you even like to achieve or collect if you prefer the mags, especially if the magazine is a particularly good publication.

02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:36.360
Hell, I still have every single solitary issue of OPM, original PlayStation magazine, all 112 and every single issue of EGM since my OPM subscription rolled over to EGM.

02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:38.360
I was wondering, what are your opinions on this?

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:45.360
I know that based on user generated comments on various sites, blogs, et cetera, that most people are uber pissed and vowed never to visit 1up.com again.

02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:49.360
Additionally, what other podcast websites and mags would you recommend to fill the void?

02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:56.360
Honestly, I want to avoid GameSpot because of their reputation and credibility has been severely tarnished early last year over that army of two firing debacle.

02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:59.360
Thank you for the email.

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:01.360
Obviously, we talked about this a little bit earlier in the show.

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:09.360
But the point that he brought up that I thought was interesting was that last paragraph was based on everybody complaining, they vowing never to visit 1up.com and all this stuff again.

02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:17.360
But here's the thing, EGM has really gone through a lot of changes since the beginning. Do a lot of people that worked there in the first couple of years work there now?

02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:23.360
Very, very few. And I know that because most of the people working at 1up.com were in their early 30s or late 20s.

02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:27.360
So they would have been like teenagers when the magazines first came out.

02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:33.360
So these magazines have already changed the guards a few times.

02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:45.360
So my question back to you guys is, yes, these guys integrated their personalities into the show and everything, which in turn probably ended up being bad for 1up.com because this would have never happened had they never had those podcasts.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:50.360
Think about it. If they never had those podcasts, if they never built up that personality, it's kind of like a double edged sword.

02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:54.360
It probably really helped sell their site. But at the same time, now they're having to deal with this.

02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:59.360
What if you'd never really gotten to know those writers as well as you did? Would you have cared so much about this news?

02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:09.360
Kind of interesting. Because I bet this kind of stuff has happened before. You didn't care because you didn't feel that connection to them from reading their Twitters, looking at their podcasts, so on and so on.

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:14.360
So kind of interesting.

02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:24.360
As far as what to recommend to fill the void, I've said this before and I've said it again. There's hundreds of people out there, almost thousands, that do stuff like we do for free every week.

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:29.360
This kind of stuff. Because we love video games too, even though it doesn't sound like it sometimes because we get ranty and things like that.

02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:38.360
It's just because we hate because we love. There's other independent podcasts that are great and awesome that you can tune out there and listen to.

02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:45.360
There's tons of networks. If you don't know where to begin, look for some of the networks that have come together, such as AllGames.com.

02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:55.360
There's what? Gamercast network, I think they're called. Especially if you like Xbox. They have a lot of Xbox centric shows over there. Look for some of the networks of shows.

02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:05.360
Because that's kind of what OneUp was, was a network, except it was a little different because they were all still produced in house. Whereas I think in the case of AllGames, Gamercast, and whatever other networks you can think of.

02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:15.360
What's the other one? Platform Nation I think is another one. Is Evil Avatar a network? I don't know off the top of my head.

02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:23.360
I think the difference is that OneUp produced all those in house. Everybody produces their own little silo show and they come together on these networks.

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:30.360
There's lots of people that love games that would love to talk about them with you out there on the internets.

02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:38.360
And obviously if you still feel connected to the OneUp guys, it sounds like they're doing their own show. So maybe it'll last for them. We'll see.

02:27:38.360 --> 02:27:53.360
Alright. I said them right? I don't remember. I think so. Okay. By the way, just for the live listeners only, and I apologize I'm too lazy to edit this kind of stuff out of the podcast.

02:27:53.360 --> 02:28:00.360
Apparently the stream is skipping now. It sounds like a CD that's skipping or something. That's not on our end guys. I don't know what's going on.

02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:07.360
I have had cable issues. I did not get to go to a WoW raid on Thursday because of Comcast cable issues.

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:08.360
Yeah, they've been suckers.

02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:11.360
God forbid you miss your story of the castle.

02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:21.360
For real. For real. And by the way, it was the dragon battle, Malygos, that I missed. And I was the only one attuned for it, so the whole guild didn't get to go because I couldn't sign on because of Comcast.

02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:29.360
So it was big drama. Big drama. But anyway, I don't know what's going on. I don't know if it's us. I don't know if it's the server. Something's up.

02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:36.360
But the podcast will be up in its entirety along with last week's podcast this week on the stream. Promise?

02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:40.360
More emails, except I just closed the mailbag. Whoops.

02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:42.360
Way to go, Rod.

02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:47.360
Sorry about that. Anything else you guys want to say on that last email? About other places to go?

02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:49.360
I don't think you touched anything.

02:28:49.360 --> 02:29:01.360
All right. GS68 emails us. Hey, OLR crew, it's GS68. So I've gotten to play my DJ Max Technica some more, thanks to me taking advantage of my winter break to go to Spiggle regularly. That's Sunnyvale Golf Land.

02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:06.360
For those not familiar with Technica, the game goes like this. One half of the screen is filled with stationary notes and a line passes over them.

02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:15.360
As the line does, you touch the notes to recreate parts of the music. Sometimes you get special notes, such as blue notes that you hold down, green and yellow notes that you drag along, and purple notes that you press repeatedly.

02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:19.360
When the line reaches the end, it continues on the other half of the screen.

02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:28.360
I feel that this game is the right step for the rhythm game genre. There's always two to three people waiting to play the game at Sunnyvale Golf Land, which shows that Technica just might keep arcades going somewhat longer.

02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:35.360
I doubt it. I hate to be the pessimist, but one game ain't gonna happen. But I appreciate your enthusiasm.

02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:47.360
The touch screen in the EBA meets luminous gameplay allows for more freedom of movement and play styles, as opposed to, say, BeatMania 2DX or DDR. I've seen players use one hand, both hands, one or two fingers, all of their fingers, and so on.

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:58.360
It does have some flaws, though. Scoring and grades are combo-based, and if I've learned anything from EBA and Ohndon, it's that combo-based scoring is retarded, as where you screw up has a big impact on your score.

02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:14.360
Also, the life meter is fairly strict. Though it falls to just as much as, say, DDR or other DJMax games, it takes forever to recover your life gauge, which is a problem in technical mode, where you need to be above a certain amount of life to get to the next stage, not unlike 2DX or Pop'n Music's regular modes.

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:24.360
And of course, being a touch-to-the-notes game as opposed to hit notes as they pass a redline game, it's harder to sight-read a song. I've seen otherwise good players fail a song because of the offbeat notes.

02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:30.360
Songs that are faster tend to be also harder than slow songs because the notes are more spaced out and you have less time to survey the notes.

02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:41.360
I'm hoping something good comes out of having a card. I have one myself, and so far it's only apparent features or modifiers, which you use max points on, and Platinum Crew mode, which is some sort of online mode I'll discuss later when it's activated.

02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:45.360
Also, our machine is looking to get an update in a few days. Hopefully we'll get some new songs about it.

02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:54.360
Also a minor but nice touch, there's a headphone jack below the touchscreen if it's hard to hear the game. Using headphones can help. Take care, maybe I'll see some of you at Spiggle.

02:30:54.360 --> 02:31:00.360
P.S. this email was brought to you by Beatrock3 from Pop'n Music, home of the never-ending Falling Books.

02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.360
So there you go.

02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:07.360
It sounds interesting. I want to try this touch game. It sounds interesting.

02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:08.360
Go to Spiggle.

02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:17.360
I actually am supposed to be in South Bay February 7th anyway, and I'm taking Victoria with me, so maybe I'll take Victoria to the arcade because we have Rocky in the South Bay on the 7th.

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:23.360
So maybe we can swing by and check out this game. Don't you want to go play video games, Victoria?

02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:25.360
OMG, totally.

02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:29.360
Alright, she just rolled her eyes. You don't want to play DDR, Victoria?

02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:38.360
I'm an epic fail at DDR, my fat ass on the damn thing, I'm like on easy, I'm like oh girl, oh girl, I need a break.

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:40.360
You can play pinball or something that's less stressful.

02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:41.360
Holla.

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:42.360
Alright.

02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:46.360
Also Victoria's ass is not fat, it's just round.

02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:51.360
I like big butts and I cannot lie. Actually I don't think Victoria's fat, but whatever.

02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:55.360
No, she's not at all. She's beautiful and single.

02:31:55.360 --> 02:31:58.360
Stop trying to pimp me, Irene.

02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:01.360
I'm not at all.

02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:08.360
Um, let me read another email here from R.J.

02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:11.360
Because I don't see another signature here, so I'm just going to say R.J.

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:16.360
Hey OLR, I'm using my lovely eye touch to send this email, so be warned Jamie if the Grammar Nazi bar is high.

02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:20.360
You lucked out, you read me tonight and I have terrible grammar so I don't judge the others.

02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:24.360
I've just finished Infinite Undiscovery and Lost Odyssey and I'm planning on getting The Last Remnant next,

02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:29.360
which I've heard is a slightly generic story but a robust and interesting battle system, so I'll tell you what I've experienced next time.

02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:34.360
Now as Rob said countless times, the beginning in Infinite Undiscovery was annoying, but the ogre part lasts not even an hour,

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:39.360
and after that the game's gameplay and story will always leave you wanting to keep continuing with it,

02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:42.360
even if the English voiceover for some of the characters are dreadful.

02:32:42.360 --> 02:32:48.360
That's the opposite case of Lost Odyssey, which has some of the best English voiceover in years, especially Janssen.

02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:53.360
The bad point for Lost Odyssey is the boring turn-based gameplay which brings nothing new at all to the table.

02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:57.360
Nevertheless, both leave you satisfied at the end and don't suffer from rehashed plot points.

02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:04.360
If you wish story is better, I'm sorry, which story is better, Lost Odyssey is and has superb presentation.

02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:11.360
With Infinite Undiscovery gameplay, in my opinion, fun yet repetitive at parts. Don't hesitate on getting either.

02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:16.360
So interesting because I gave up on Infinite Undiscovery because the beginning is terrible.

02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:17.360
Really?

02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:20.360
Oh, but I even got past that ogre part he's talking about.

02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:25.360
No, maybe because I got into like the really dark forest and that part annoyed me too and whatever.

02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:26.360
I'll go back to it someday.

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:29.360
Too bad you didn't have a button to just pass.

02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:34.360
For real. For real. Thank you. Seriously? Seriously, I would have hit the button on that game.

02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:35.360
For serious, yeah.

02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:36.360
I would have. For real.

02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:38.360
Yeah. For realsies.

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:43.360
And it's signed P.S. Rob. Queen was the better 70s band than ABBA.

02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:46.360
I love Queen. Queen is amazing.

02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.360
Queen is amazing. Queen Mercury was...

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:50.360
I know. Freddie Mercury is a god.

02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:51.360
I would love to be his head. Oh my god.

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:53.360
Freddie Mercury was a god, really.

02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:58.360
But, I'm sorry, ABBA's still number one. But Queen is like seriously two or three. Seriously.

02:33:58.360 --> 02:33:59.360
Two or maybe three.

02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:01.360
Maybe two or three. Because Bowie's kind of, you know.

02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:06.360
Oh, from Labyrinth. He's awesome.

02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:07.360
There you go. That's my thoughts on that.

02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:12.360
And just a couple more here. Sorry, I know we have a lot of emails tonight, but that's alright.

02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:13.360
We don't have a lot of...

02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:18.360
This one's for Fart Princess, which we haven't called her that tonight, but Fart Princess.

02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:23.360
No, since Rice or Fart Princess, which, by the way, can I say this about Fart Princess real quick?

02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:24.360
I was on WoW last night.

02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:26.360
Okay, do you have to bring this up?

02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:27.360
Boo!

02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:28.360
Thank you.

02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:32.360
And for an hour, she was talking about farts and guilt chat.

02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:35.360
It was not an hour. It was like five minutes.

02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:36.360
It felt like an hour.

02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.360
It was incidental, okay?

02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:41.360
She talked to you. You were talking about farts for an hour.

02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:46.360
And Vlad kept talking to me, okay? So, obviously, someone was interested in what I had to say.

02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:51.360
Since Rice Princess is here tonight, this is from Amaze Satsuma, I'll go ahead and ask,

02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:54.360
how did you all like the latest Battlestar Galactica episode?

02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:55.360
Oh my god!

02:34:55.360 --> 02:35:00.360
We all know the BSG talk is in, was going to happen sooner or later with her here,

02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:02.360
so I thought I'd give it a helping hand.

02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:05.360
No spoilers. I haven't watched it yet because I'm still on season three.

02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:10.360
This doesn't spoil anything, but I am depressed beyond belief.

02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:15.360
I want to elaborate more, but I can't because then I'll start getting into the spoilers.

02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:19.360
But, oh man, I absolutely want to keep watching.

02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:23.360
They know how to make people keep coming back and wanting more.

02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:27.360
And this is just, yeah, but better.

02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:32.360
I did hear, because it was inadvertently spoiled for me, that now the last Cylon has been revealed, right?

02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:33.360
You here tell correct.

02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:35.360
Was it shocking?

02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:38.360
I thought it was stupid.

02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:43.360
I hope that's not a spoiler, but I'm hoping that it wasn't an actual revelation of the final Cylon,

02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:49.360
that it was just speculation on behalf of one of the characters in the show.

02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:54.360
But, I don't know, I think it pretty much is confirmation that it is the last Cylon,

02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:57.360
but if that is the last Cylon, I'll be upset.

02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:58.360
Alright.

02:35:58.360 --> 02:35:59.360
That's all I have to say.

02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:00.360
Yeah.

02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:01.360
Okay.

02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:02.360
That's enough. We won't say any more.

02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:04.360
Okay. No BSG.

02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:05.360
Alright.

02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:11.360
One other email from our old buddy DMN who wants to update you on the March Madness competition that's going on.

02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:14.360
Remember, this is the controversial one last year where Super Metroid beat Chrono Trigger,

02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:16.360
and I got hate mail for a year because of it?

02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:18.360
Yeah, as deserved.

02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:22.360
Here is your chance to write what has been wronged.

02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:28.360
You can send your top 25 to Bresloll, I guess is his name.

02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:31.360
But there's a specific email address you actually want to send those to.

02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:33.360
I know it's a Gmail address.

02:36:33.360 --> 02:36:34.360
Let me look it up real quick.

02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:36.360
And this is the last week to do so, by the way.

02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:37.360
There's like six days left.

02:36:37.360 --> 02:36:41.360
uslmadness, all one word, at gmail.com.

02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:45.360
You want to send those into Bresloll as fast as you can because you only have six days left.

02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:47.360
Here's the rundown of the top 25 so far.

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:53.360
Keep in mind, this is only determining the seeds for the head-to-head competitions that will happen later on.

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:56.360
This is not the end right now.

02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:58.360

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:13.360

02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:15.360

8, Dance Dance Revolution.

02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:29.360
7, Super Metroid.

02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:33.360
At 7, excuse me, excuse me.

02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:36.360
Number 6, Super Mario 3.

02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:39.360
Number 5, Final Fantasy VI.

02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:41.360
Number 4, The Ocarina of Time.

02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:43.360
Number 3, Link to the Past.

02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:46.360
Number 2, Chrono Trigger.

02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:48.360
Yeah, that's right, bitch.

02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:50.360
Like five places up.

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:55.360
And the current number one game of all time, according to the people who have emailed.

02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:56.360
Big Rigs.

02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:57.360
No.

02:37:57.360 --> 02:37:58.360
Just kidding.

02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:00.360
Rock Band is the number one game of all time.

02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:05.360
If you consider that music game fans, you know, is our roots, I'm not surprised.

02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:11.360
But, if you disagree, here's your chance to send in your list to make Super Metroid number one so it gets a little higher.

02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:13.360
Why the fuck is Pokemon on there?

02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:14.360
Alright.

02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:15.360
I don't like Pokemon.

02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:16.360
So there you go.

02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:19.360
If you disagree, again, get those lists in, you have six days left.

02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:20.360
That's it.

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:21.360
Okay, thanks Rob.

02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:22.360
Because they're closing the polls.

02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:23.360
So, are you going to send in a list?

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:24.360
Your top 25 of all time?

02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:25.360
Probably not.

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:27.360
I already know my, I'm secure in my decision.

02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:29.360
My top five games of all time.

02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:30.360
Alright.

02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:31.360
I don't need to, like, validate it.

02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:32.360
Alright.

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:33.360
Just stuck up, bitch.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:34.360
Alright.

02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:35.360
That's going to do it for the emails.

02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:40.360
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you'd like to send your own email in for read, for

02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:41.360
reading?

02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:42.360
Red read?

02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:43.360
I don't know, Rob.

02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:44.360
To read on the air next week.

02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.360
Speak English.

02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:46.360
Thank God Jamie's not here.

02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:47.360
I would have just got a fail award.

02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:48.360
Yeah.

02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:49.360
She would have thrown a taco at you.

02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:53.360
Back to some gaming news, and then we're going to take some calls on the Skype line at 1877.

02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:56.360
You mean Victoria's going to take a call?

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.360
1877 Game OLR.

02:38:57.360 --> 02:38:58.360
In a little bit.

02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:00.360
We still have some stories.

02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:01.360
Loki.

02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:07.360
This week on Xbox Live Arcade, we'll be getting the brand new game, The Maw.

02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:10.360
The Maw is being put out by TwistedPixels.

02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:16.360
It's an adventure platformer that places you in the role of Frank, an alien stranded on

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:21.360
a strange planet with The Maw, a strange blob-like creature that acts like his only friend and

02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:26.360
ultimate weapon all at the same time.

02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:29.360
Let's see, it will be available for 800 Microsoft points.

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:35.360
We'll be out on the 21st, and if I remember correctly, I think The Maw was a winner of

02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:40.360
some award during PAX, but I can't remember what it was.

02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:41.360
Oh well.

02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:44.360
Was it one of those indie games that was featured in the center?

02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:45.360
Yes, it was.

02:39:45.360 --> 02:39:47.360
I remember hearing about that.

02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:48.360
That's cool.

02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:49.360
Very neat.

02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.360
Awesome.

02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:54.360
Fable 2, which I'm finally going to get a chance to play this week, because Loki helped

02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:57.360
me get hooked up with a copy of Fable 2, so I'm going to check that out this week, and

02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:00.360
I know this is a game that, like, Dark Soccer has been playing a lot.

02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:04.360
I haven't seen her on Xbox Live a lot until this game came out, and apparently she's been

02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:08.360
playing with, like, OLR people and stuff, so I'm going to get on there and finally get

02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:09.360
to play some Fable 2.

02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:10.360
You're not a big fan?

02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:11.360
It's okay.

02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:14.360
I actually have to go back and play because I want to finish it.

02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:15.360
It's short.

02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:20.360
I'm thinking about getting the download content, though, for it, then I can start Fallout 3.

02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:21.360
Or maybe Lost Aussie.

02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:23.360
I may have to go back to Lost Aussie.

02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:24.860
Well, I think I'm going to check out Fable 2.

02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:30.360
I might even play it tonight and force Victoria to watch some of it with me, but we'll see.

02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:32.360
Victoria, I just caught Victoria's attention.

02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:33.360
I'm going to play some Fable 2 tonight.

02:40:33.360 --> 02:40:35.360
It's a video game.

02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:37.360
She's going yippee.

02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:38.360
You'll have my laptop.

02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:40.360
You can chat with your hoes on AOL.

02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:41.360
You'll be fine.

02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:47.360
You can marry people of the same sex or, like, have multiple husbands and wives and babies.

02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:51.360
Well, I've been watching Sauce, you know, or Tiara, whatever you want to call her.

02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:52.360
She's been on this show a couple times.

02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:55.360
I've been watching her tweets that have been updating us on the progress of her.

02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:57.360
It sounds like she's having a lot of fun.

02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:01.360
I think she has two husbands and a wife and a child named Optimus Prime.

02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:04.360
So I want to check this out.

02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:10.360
So anyhow, speaking of Fable 2, the download content, not whole island, finally came out.

02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:15.360
Apparently, there's a weapon in it called Howl's Rifle.

02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:20.360
The funny thing about it, it looks exactly like the assault rifle from Halo.

02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:21.360
Get it?

02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:22.360
Howl?

02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:23.360
Halo?

02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:28.360
59 damage per shot, 24 shots per clip, and has an empty augment slot.

02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:32.360
So basically, they kind of made a little Halo lol joke in the download content.

02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:33.360
Halo.

02:41:33.360 --> 02:41:34.360
Halo.

02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:35.360
Wow.

02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:36.360
Nice.

02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:40.360
Redtertainment says, Sky, why are you forcing Victoria to do things?

02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:41.360
What is she, your girlfriend?

02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:43.360
No, but kind of.

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.360
I mean, she's like one of my hags.

02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:47.360
So, and she has to crash here all weekend.

02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:50.360
So I've got, I've got two of my hags here tonight.

02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:51.360
I'm very special.

02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:55.360
It's the least I could do for letting, you know, him letting me stay here and not sleep

02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:56.360
in my car.

02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:59.360
It's the least that she can do as his hag.

02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:02.360
We have hag duties, you know, that we have to do.

02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:04.360
And this is some of it.

02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:05.360
What did it say?

02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:08.360
If the hag, if the hag don't like you, the fag.

02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:10.360
If the hag hates you, the fag don't date you.

02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:12.360
But that goes the other way around too.

02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:13.360
Yep.

02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:14.360
It does go there.

02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:16.360
Like I have to approve of anyone Victoria or Irene dates.

02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:17.360
This is true.

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:18.360
Yep.

02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:19.360
I have to approve.

02:42:19.360 --> 02:42:20.360
Of?

02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:21.360
Of?

02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:25.360
Well, don't ask that on the radio for God's sake.

02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:29.360
If, if I didn't, I would have said something already.

02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:33.360
And you, you Irene have been, you know, with your man a long time.

02:42:33.360 --> 02:42:34.360
I've been with my man.

02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:37.360
So if I disapproved, I would have said something a long time ago.

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:39.360
You would have bitch slapped the shit out of him.

02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:40.360
I would have bitch slapped you.

02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:41.360
All right.

02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:44.360
Cause Irene makes no qualms if she dislikes somebody I'm dating.

02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:47.360
Yes, we know.

02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:52.360
Nellie was saying that she wants to get a second wife to do all the cleaning and cooking

02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.360
because she doesn't do any of that.

02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:55.360
You should.

02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:56.360
All right.

02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:57.360
Anyhow.

02:42:57.360 --> 02:42:58.360
I'm sorry.

02:42:58.360 --> 02:42:59.360
We got derailed talking.

02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:01.360
If you become a gay man, that will be easy.

02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:04.360
Cause you'll get a bunch of hags who will do that for you.

02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:06.360
Why can't I have street hags?

02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:08.360
Because there's no such thing as a straight hag.

02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:09.360
Are you ridiculous?

02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:10.360
I am going to pioneer this.

02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:12.360
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:13.360
Yes I can.

02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:15.360
What else do you do with cake?

02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:16.360
You should take applications.

02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:18.360
I don't know how many people like tacos.

02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:20.360
Loki, you have a radio show.

02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:23.360
You should solicit applications for some straight hags.

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:29.360
Cause see street hags, that's actual real hags and no one likes real hags.

02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:32.360
You should just put on the application four tooth minimum.

02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:36.360
No fat chicks.

02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:37.360
All right.

02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.360
Anyways, SSJ100 Matt says Loki needs to find a girl who's into airsofts.

02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:43.360
Wait a minute though.

02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:44.360
We're not trying to set him up on a date.

02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:45.360
He's very happily married.

02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:47.360
Him and Nellie get along fabulously.

02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:50.360
He just wants a maid that works for free.

02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:53.360
I just want someone that'll cook.

02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:55.360
Well I cook, so that's fine.

02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:58.360
Mainly clean and maybe walk around naked if she's hot.

02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:00.360
Yeah, why not?

02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:02.360
Is that so much to ask?

02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:03.360
Geez.

02:44:03.360 --> 02:44:04.360
It's not asking much.

02:44:04.360 --> 02:44:06.360
I'm not asking to have sex with me or something.

02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:12.360
No, you want someone for Nellie to nag so that she gets it out of her system before you get home.

02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:14.360
Oh thank god.

02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:18.360
I was like, that would be awesome.

02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:20.360
Speaking of the airsoft stuff.

02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:22.360
Doesn't even have to be a woman.

02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:26.360
I haven't been good when it comes to the airsoft stuff.

02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:28.360
Sorry, OLR Studio Drama.

02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:30.360
You know how we tape in the garage basically, very thin wall.

02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:33.360
I think I can hear the neighbor yelling at a dog or something.

02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:35.360
We can hear it all the way here in the garage.

02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:37.360
Oh my god, I hope he's not throwing his...

02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:40.360
I think somebody just threw a taco across the street at the dog.

02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:42.360
Really? I'll be back.

02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:44.360
Anyways, I'm hungry.

02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:46.360
Back to game news here.

02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:55.360
We talked about last week how there was a game that possibly will get removed off of the app store relatively soon if Nintendo caught wind of it.

02:44:55.360 --> 02:44:57.360
And that was the Game & Watch game.

02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:59.360
Well now there's another Nintendo game.

02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:01.360
Duck Hunt is now available for $1.

02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:03.360
Damn, I forgot to download the Game & Watch game.

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:04.360
Shit.

02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:05.360
Oh no.

02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:07.360
Well I don't know if it might still be up there.

02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:09.360
I mean, you just better check.

02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:14.360
And then Duck Hunt is available now for a dollar.

02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:16.360
One dollar.

02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:18.360
Yes, one dollar.

02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:20.360
And it has everything in the game.

02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:22.360
Ducks and no annoying dog.

02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:25.360
You move the cursor around and shoot ducks.

02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:27.360
All for a dollar.

02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:28.360
All for a dollar.

02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:30.360
What a bargain.

02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.360
But the laughing dog isn't in it, so what the hell's the point?

02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:37.360
You shoot ducks.

02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:41.360
Well, you know, maybe they didn't like the dog.

02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:43.360
So, you know.

02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:44.360
Who cares?

02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:49.360
Hence the reason he prefaced that statement with annoying.

02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:52.360
Alright, sorry, I'm looking for the Game & Watch games right now to see if they're there.

02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:53.360
I don't think they're there.

02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:54.360
What was the name of it?

02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:57.360
Um, crap.

02:45:57.360 --> 02:46:01.360
I searched for Game & Watch and didn't find anything.

02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:03.360
Here, just one second, I can find it for you.

02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:08.360
It is... it's not called Game & Watch, it's called...

02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:10.360
Alright, you look while I talk about the next story.

02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:14.360
Here it is, it's GW Chef, GW Parachute, GW Fire.

02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:15.360
Just look for GW.

02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:17.360
GW, thank you.

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:21.360
Alright, I'll look at that after I read you this story because this is pretty exciting, okay?

02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:24.360
I love the Commodore 64.

02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:25.360
Didn't you love the Commodore 64?

02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:26.360
Oh my gosh, some of it, yeah.

02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:31.360
Do you remember, if I start talking this, you are standing in front of a White House.

02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:32.360
There is a mailbox here.

02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:34.360
Is that Zork?

02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:36.360
It is Zork, exactly right.

02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:38.360
You have been eaten by a grew.

02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.360
Oh, I knew you were going to do that.

02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:44.360
Okay, and obviously Zork actually had a couple of other games that came out later, like Zork Grand & Quizzer.

02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:46.360
They were kind of cute, funny games.

02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:50.360
Well, apparently Zork is coming back as an MMO.

02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:51.360
What?

02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:52.360
Legends of Zork.

02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:54.360
Wiggity what?

02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:57.360
Joel Online is resurrecting the Zork franchise.

02:46:57.360 --> 02:46:58.360
It's a game called Legends of Zork.

02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:01.360
It's a casual, browser-based MMO.

02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:06.360
I don't think it's up just yet, but they actually were interviewed by Grandma Sutra recently,

02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:09.360
and they have mentioned that the game is going to feature microtransactions.

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:12.360
You can play it on the computer or the iPhone.

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:14.360
So that's kind of cool.

02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:15.360
Sweet.

02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:16.360
There you go.

02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:17.360
What are you so upset about?

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.360
My phone just died.

02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:20.360
Victoria's phone died, big drama.

02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.360
Maybe we could bring it back to life.

02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:27.360
I'm wondering how fast it's going to be before people get eaten by a grew.

02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:30.360
I want to push Irene in front of a grew.

02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:35.360
I'm going to push you off the edge of something from Impossible Mission.

02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:37.360
No.

02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:40.360
I almost did that for the classic game tonight, but it was Loki's turn.

02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:42.360
Oh my gosh, I love that game so much.

02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:46.360
It was Loki's turn, and I actually found another Commodore 64 game I wanted to do first before Impossible Mission.

02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:50.360
You need to get the sound bites from that game and use it sometimes in here.

02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:52.360
Stay a while.

02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:54.360
Stay forever.

02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:55.360
Hold on a minute.

02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:01.360
I love that game so much, but I couldn't ever play it because I was only like 10.

02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:05.360
You know, I never realized what it was he was saying in the beginning of the game.

02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:07.360
Another visitor.

02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:08.360
Yeah.

02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:09.360
Visitor.

02:48:09.360 --> 02:48:11.360
Stay a while.

02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:15.360
Stay forever.

02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:16.360
Anyhow.

02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:17.360
What does he say?

02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:19.360
Get him my robots or something.

02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:20.360
Shut up.

02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:21.360
Let's go on to the story.

02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:23.360
Two more stories before we open up the Skyblind.

02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:25.360
Hurry. Go. Do it.

02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:26.360
Loki.

02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.360
Well, there's some other fun stuff.

02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:32.360
We talked about Klonoa coming out on the Wii.

02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:35.360
It's actually been out on the Wii already in Japan.

02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:38.360
And, of course, will be coming out over here.

02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:40.360
Pretty soon, actually.

02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:45.360
It's been announced that sometime in 2009 it will be available.

02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:48.360
Or possibly April.

02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:50.360
Then it might move. Who knows?

02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:51.360
April 4th.

02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:52.360
No, not April 4th.

02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:54.360
Why not?

02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:58.360
It's a great day to release stuff.

02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.360
April 4th.

02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:04.360
And, you know, when these games come out, you can rent them at Game.

02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:07.360
That's right. Game is not here in the US.

02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:09.360
So if you're looking confused, like, what the hell is Game?

02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:13.360
It's actually a big competitor for the GameStop EB behemoth over in Europe.

02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:16.360
And it's also in Australia and parts of Asia.

02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:19.360
They actually are only in the business of selling new and used games right now.

02:49:19.360 --> 02:49:21.360
But soon they are going to rent games.

02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:24.360
They partnered up with a group called Swap Game.

02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:29.360
So they're going to be offering folks over in the UK the option of paying a monthly subscription fee

02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:32.360
that will allow them to rent two games at a time.

02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:34.360
Like a GameStop employee.

02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:36.360
Yeah, interesting business model, though.

02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:39.360
Do you think that's going to make them a lot of money?

02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:41.360
Rental, it couldn't hurt.

02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:44.360
I mean, I think it, well...

02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.360
Why not? A lot of those sites are making money.

02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:50.360
If they're going to do, like, a mail service where they're going to mail out the games or something.

02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:55.360
I don't know. I was just thinking if I ever opened up a game store, I'd want to name it Store.

02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:58.360
You know, because let's just get it as broad as possible.

02:49:58.360 --> 02:49:59.360
Store.

02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:02.360
Good luck getting any new releases, though, from a place like this.

02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:07.360
You know, I always wondered, like, because movie rental stores always rent games.

02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:10.360
But that never made sense that game stores never rented games.

02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:13.360
Like, you would think that's where you would go to do something like that.

02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:17.360
I have a few customers of mine that actually rent games and they sell games, too.

02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:21.360
So, it's something that they do, but it doesn't make them a lot of money.

02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:26.360
Yeah, but no game stores here in America right now rent out games, do they?

02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:31.360
Maybe if you want to consider GameCrazy, which basically is in a Hollywood video.

02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:35.360
Yeah, I don't know. I think of GameCrazy as not, like, an independent thing.

02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:38.360
I think of them as, like, part of Hollywood video.

02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:39.360
Yeah.

02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:41.360
I mean, you know, that's a movie rental place.

02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:44.360
And GameStop wouldn't do it because they would cut into their used game sales.

02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:50.360
Because, you know, why bother paying $30 for, you know, a $40 game or something like that

02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:53.360
when they can rent it for $7 and beat it in a week or so.

02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:58.360
Well, they could still do the buybacks of the used games and then rent out those games as a buyback.

02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:00.360
And besides, those games they consider new.

02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:02.360
Remember, they just put a little sticker on them.

02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:03.360
I want to say this.

02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:07.360
Misty in chat says, it sounds more immediate than GameFly if it weren't a mail-based return system.

02:51:07.360 --> 02:51:08.360
And that's true.

02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:10.360
And some people don't like to do the mail thing.

02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:12.360
I mean, Netflix is huge, but they're still Blockbuster.

02:51:12.360 --> 02:51:15.360
Because sometimes, you know, just like even last night, Victoria was over.

02:51:15.360 --> 02:51:18.360
I was here, bored, done with WoW.

02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:19.360
Let's watch a movie.

02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:23.360
But, you know, I didn't want to wait for Netflix.

02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:25.360
We tried looking on the PlayStation.

02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:26.360
There was nothing we wanted to pay to Dallas.

02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:28.360
I was like, well, maybe we should just go to Blockbuster and look.

02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:29.360
Exactly.

02:51:29.360 --> 02:51:33.360
You know, sometimes you want that instant gratification that even the mail won't get you.

02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:34.360
Yeah.

02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:36.360
No, that's kind of like, I don't know.

02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:41.360
That's why I prefer having the monthly thing at Blockbuster where you can go in the store and rent it

02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:43.360
as opposed to their total access online or whatever.

02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:44.360
No.

02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:50.360
I'm surprised and I'm sure it will happen that they haven't done game rentals available over, you know,

02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:52.360
like Xbox Live or something like that.

02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:55.360
You download the game and you have it for seven days or something.

02:51:55.360 --> 02:51:57.360
Probably just a matter of time.

02:51:57.360 --> 02:52:02.360
If they could make money off renting the game, then selling the game, that would be amazing.

02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:03.360
That would be, yeah.

02:52:03.360 --> 02:52:04.360
Smart business would be.

02:52:04.360 --> 02:52:05.360
Oh, there you go.

02:52:05.360 --> 02:52:06.360
Next.

02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:07.360
All right.

02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:08.360
That's it for stories tonight.

02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:09.360
We're going to get into some last-minute stories.

02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:14.360
But first, we want to take your calls on the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:18.360
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you have the Skype program and want to talk to us that way.

02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:20.360
Let's go to the phone and take some calls.

02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:22.360
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:23.360
Who's this?

02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:24.360
Hey, it's Ronma.

02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:25.360
What's up, everyone?

02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:26.360
Hey, not much.

02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:27.360
How you doing, Ronma?

02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:28.360
I'm doing good.

02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:30.360
Well, what is on your mind tonight?

02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:31.360
So I got a couple of things I want to discuss.

02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:32.360
All right.

02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:38.360
Number one, the whole thing about EGM going down, I'm really sad by that because growing up,

02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:44.360
that was one of three magazines I pretty much read like it was a religion to me.

02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:46.360
I got a quick question for you, though.

02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:48.360
When was the last time you bought EGM?

02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:50.360
About a couple of months ago.

02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:51.360
I still had a subscription.

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:52.360
Okay.

02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:53.360
That's cool.

02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:55.360
I'm just curious because I bet there's some people that are sad.

02:52:55.360 --> 02:53:00.360
You know, I was sad to see EGM go, but I haven't bought it in like 10 years.

02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:01.360
You know what I mean?

02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:04.360
But I'm just kind of curious on what side of the fence you're on there.

02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:07.360
So you were still a regular reader of it, so okay, you're sad to see it go.

02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:08.360
Yeah, pretty much.

02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:12.360
It was that, Die Hard, Game Fan, and Game Pro.

02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:15.360
Those were the three magazines I read all throughout high school.

02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:16.360
That was it for me.

02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:17.360
Isn't Game Pro still around?

02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:22.360
Yeah, that's still around, but Die Hard, Game Fan died after like two or three years.

02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:28.360
I love that because at the time it was the only magazine available that had an in-depth review about in-port video games.

02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:30.360
Hmm.

02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:32.360
Weird, obscure fact about Game Pro.

02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:33.360
I've got to say this.

02:53:33.360 --> 02:53:34.360
This is what a nerd I am.

02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:36.360
I don't know if you remember way back in the day.

02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:38.360
If you read Game Pro for a long time, you'll remember this.

02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:44.360
A long, long time ago, they had a contest to get like, I think it was 250 people,

02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:51.360
or maybe it was 50 or 250 people that were going to be part of an exclusive club that would get to write reviews for games or something like that

02:53:51.360 --> 02:53:53.360
for possible inclusion in the magazine or something.

02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:54.360
This was a long time ago, so bear with me.

02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:55.360
But this is what I remember.

02:53:55.360 --> 02:53:58.360
I was in like the fourth grade or fifth grade or something, and I wrote in a letter.

02:53:58.360 --> 02:54:00.360
I got picked as one of them.

02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:01.360
Nice.

02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:02.360
Wow, in fourth grade?

02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:04.360
But they never did anything with it.

02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:05.360
Boo.

02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:11.360
I never got anything else other than the letter it said, you know, congratulations, you got selected, and then they never did anything with it.

02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:12.360
So, this is funny.

02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:13.360
Sorry, just a rant.

02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:15.360
Whenever I think of Game Pro, I think of that.

02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:16.360
Wow.

02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:19.360
From when I was like, maybe it was a little late, like sixth grade, but I was young.

02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.360
I know I was young.

02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:22.360
Dork.

02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:23.360
Well.

02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:24.360
Yeah, kind of sad.

02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:31.360
But, you know, some of those magazines are still around, but I sadly don't think this will be the last one to fold.

02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:42.360
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if any more fold, because honestly, I mean, as many video gaming sites there are, it's getting to the point where it's like video gaming industry with news and stuff is getting very saturated.

02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:50.360
It's like every other site, someone has a video game review site or blog or something like that, whereas me, I'm on opposite spectrum for what I cover.

02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:52.360
It's kind of hard to get that kind of information.

02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:53.360
Yeah.

02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:56.360
What else did you want to talk about tonight?

02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:03.360
You know, there was a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I totally forgot, but I will do a brief review about The Last Remnant.

02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:05.360
It's a game I just picked up yesterday.

02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:06.360
Ah, yes, please do.

02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:17.360
Basically, it plays like Final Fantasy XII, but when it comes to the battle sequences, it turns into a complete tactical style game, which I'm really enjoying a lot.

02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:23.360
Really? What about the story? I've heard kind of mixed reviews on this game, so I'm kind of curious.

02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:34.360
If I remember correctly, the story is about a brother and sister are going to meet up with their parents, but the sister is kidnapped, and he goes through his travels to find his sister,

02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:41.360
and you're discovering what these last remnants are, or these relics for all types of different types of power that you can get.

02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:43.360
Hmm.

02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:52.360
And right now, I'm like four or five hours in, and just like a regular tactics game, if you're not fully prepared, you will get killed on the first quest.

02:55:52.360 --> 02:56:02.360
Interesting. Huh. So is this something for like a hardcore tactical game fan only, or can anyone get into it, or what?

02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:11.360
It's like this. If you're not really into tactics games, but there are some tactical games that are very simple, and you want something simple like that,

02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:17.360
this would be a good game to pick up, but to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't pay the $59.99 retail price tag for it.

02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:22.360
I got it on sale for $39. I would say, when you see it for $39, then pick it up then.

02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:24.360
Gotcha.

02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:25.360
Yeah, definitely.

02:56:25.360 --> 02:56:28.360
Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?

02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.360
Now remember one more thing, and I'll get out of here.

02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:31.360
Yes.

02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:36.360
Remember a long time ago, I sent in a letter, an email about which games I should get for my $360?

02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:40.360
Um, yes, I think so.

02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:44.360
Yeah, I actually picked up each of the games that you guys recommended for me.

02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:45.360
Oh, really?

02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:49.360
I finally got around to doing so.

02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:51.360
Um, what did you think?

02:56:51.360 --> 02:56:55.360
Okay, Blue Dragon, I'm still playing. I really enjoy that.

02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:01.360
Loving Saints Row, and I'm loving Crackdown, and Marvel Ultimate Alliance is definitely a fun party game.

02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:04.360
Hmm. Cool, cool.

02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:07.360
Oh, you're good. I'm glad our reviews did some good.

02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:09.360
Well, you guys are awesome. What can I tell you?

02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:12.360
Oh, I do love you. It's almost like we pay you to say that.

02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:15.360
Hmm. Just wait till you come out here again.

02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:20.360
Uh huh. Alright, but hey, hopefully soon. It is one of my goals for 09 to get back to New York City.

02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:22.360
It just probably won't happen until later in the year.

02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:23.360
We'll be waiting.

02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:24.360
Alright, have a good one.

02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.360
Alright. Later. Bye.

02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:28.360
Bye, Ranma.

02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:31.360
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:36.360
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. It is Jason coming to you with one less tooth in his mouth.

02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:42.360
Well, hey, Jay. I know we've both been having dental drama this week, except yours sounds a little more severe, so I'm really sorry to hear it.

02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:47.360
Yeah, mine went a little bit crazy, but my mouth's been fine ever since Thursday.

02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:50.360
That's what it's all about then, so isn't it the worst?

02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:52.360
Alright, I don't want to think about my mouth because then it's just going to hurt more.

02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:57.360
By the way, I don't know if you've seen, have you seen what Deep Man's done for the OLR Beta?

02:57:57.360 --> 02:58:03.360
Yeah, he was giving it to me. He showed me the link just a couple minutes ago, and I was futzing around with it.

02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:06.360
It's a lot more attractive pretty instantly, I've got to say.

02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:15.360
I know, I know. He did a nice job, so I've got to get you kids to work together behind the scenes to help make it happen so we can launch the new website, because I'm all excited now.

02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:21.360
Alright, anyhow, we've got to show it to Jamie, though. She's not here tonight to give it her okay, but she'll love it, too. I know she will.

02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:24.360
Oh, yeah, there's not going to be...

02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:30.360
How can you look at the current site and go, oh, the current site's better? You really can, and the new site's pretty awesome.

02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:32.360
I can agree with that.

02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:45.360
Do you know, can I say the one piece of feedback I ended up giving Deep Man on the site was actually, he used a little Pac-Man graphic in the logo, and I was too afraid it looked too similar to the logo for another independent game podcast.

02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:53.360
But I'm like, out of all the things I could have said need to be changed about the website, I'm like, that is nothing. The website's awesome. It's awesome.

02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:54.360
Space Invaders?

02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:55.360
Huh?

02:58:55.360 --> 02:58:56.360
Pac-Man?

02:58:56.360 --> 02:58:58.360
No, he changed it, I think, to a Space Invader now.

02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:01.360
Okay, yeah, like I said, just a couple minutes.

02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:11.360
The Pac-Man is right next to this little radio looking thing, and it looks way too similar to another show's logo, so I was like, eh, we don't want to do that. We don't want to ruffle any feathers.

02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:15.360
I suggested a Space Invader, and I guess he ran with it. I haven't seen the new logo yet. Anyway...

02:59:15.360 --> 02:59:18.360
I just completely lost you. Don't tell me I just completely lost you.

02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:25.360
Well, we'll open up... No, I'm here. Hello? Can you hear us? Are we having internet issues going on?

02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:27.360
Yes, I blame you and nobody else.

02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:36.360
I did not dump him. Anyway, Jason, if you can hear me, why don't you tell us what you really called in for tonight before I hijacked website talk.

02:59:36.360 --> 02:59:41.360
You can hear me now, right? Yeah, there's my echo. Okay, two questions.

02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:42.360
Yes.

02:59:42.360 --> 02:59:52.360
How long did... This is a question from Ryan, but she's too shy to get on the microphone because she's like that. How long did EGM2 last?

02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:58.360
EGM2, that's right. They had a spinoff magazine for a little while, didn't they? Like they were trying...

02:59:58.360 --> 03:00:00.360
That's retarded.

03:00:00.360 --> 03:00:05.360
No, I remember. Famitsu was a weekly magazine, so they felt, I think for a short time there, that there was going to be like...

03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:10.360
Didn't EGM2 come out like in the middle of the month or something to like offset it?

03:00:10.360 --> 03:00:14.360
I never... She had it. FYI, you went off the air again.

03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:22.360
It was not very long. Maybe a year. Maybe a year. So, just ignore the complaints about the stream and chat, Jason.

03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:24.360
We're going to just keep going with the show even if they can't hear us.

03:00:24.360 --> 03:00:28.360
Well, I have it in the background and I noticed a very specific loop, so...

03:00:28.360 --> 03:00:29.360
Oh, sorry about that.

03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:30.360
So about a year.

03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:39.360
I think. I don't know. I'm definitely not the source. Let's see. Oh, no. Here we go. EGM2 ran from July 1994 to July 1998.

03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:41.360
So it was actually four years. Wow.

03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:42.360
Four years. Nice.

03:00:42.360 --> 03:00:44.360
I was way off.

03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:50.360
She had a subscription to both and I've never heard of it, but she wanted to know, so I am making you people do... or me.

03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:55.360
There you have it. I got that from Wikipedia and I believe everything I read on Wikipedia, so there you go.

03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:59.360
That's just because I'm older than Jason.

03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:06.360
Thank you. I'm glad she hopped on the mic to clarify. What was the second question?

03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:12.360
I have never heard of this before and I just kind of bumped across it, so I figured I'd ask it tonight.

03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:20.360
Silent Hill 2 Restless Dreams. It's apparently something on the PS2. What?

03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:26.360
They released a little later on. I don't know if it was on the PS2, but there was two versions of Silent Hill 2.

03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:33.360
The second version, Restless Dreams, has an additional scenario where... don't you play as Maria or something?

03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:37.360
It's really short. It's not a lot. It's not like you're getting a whole second game.

03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:42.360
It's just like another little quick scenario that just gives some additional insight to the story.

03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:46.360
So it was like a little bonus disc add-on that they released slightly later.

03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:50.360
You got it. Like a bonus chapter. I wouldn't even think of it as a full game. It's very short.

03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:55.360
It's not even really a game. I don't even think you really do much. You do one thing and that's...

03:01:55.360 --> 03:02:02.360
Restless Dreams, I believe, was originally for the Xbox expansion and then I think they re-released it on the PS2 with the Restless Dreams thing.

03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:13.360
Interesting. I went through and I replayed all the Metal Gear Solids and then that led up to the time that we got the PS3 and I played Metal Gear Solid 4 all the way through.

03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:25.360
And our next run-through series of Silent Hill and I'm, barring the dental madness, I've been playing through Silent Hill 1 and I think I might be finishing that off tonight.

03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:31.360
And since obviously Silent Hill 2 was the next one in line and I came across that, I had never heard of it before.

03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:35.360
You'll like Silent Hill 2 a lot.

03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:45.360
She was wondering if we were just going to skip the first one and as much as I want to because the game plays like hell and it really looks really bad.

03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:52.360
I don't know if it's the PS2 doing something back compat but it has some really weird effects on our TV.

03:02:52.360 --> 03:03:01.360
We were both thinking of just skipping the first one but she doesn't remember much of it and I fell asleep through some of it.

03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:05.360
I wasn't the one who played it in the first place so I kind of wanted to go through it the whole way and see it.

03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:08.360
I'm admittedly using a walkthrough all the way through it.

03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:13.360
So that hint system is actually viable to some situations, Loki.

03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:26.360
Yeah, I'm cheating all the way through it but I'm getting the entire story in the manner it was supposed to be presented to me and I'm playing the game to some extent so that's kind of enough for me.

03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:28.360
Nice.

03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:39.360
And you want to play through 1 because it's not necessary but it's good to play through 1 when you play through 3 because it'll kind of give some insight into 3's story also.

03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:42.360
I watched Silent Hill the movie, what do I need to play the game for?

03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:44.360
Because it's completely different.

03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:49.360
Because if you're like 3 you'll think it's crap unless you give some insight to the series.

03:03:49.360 --> 03:03:54.360
Alright, I have to admit, if I'd never played the games I would have thought the movie was kind of random.

03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:55.360
You know what I mean?

03:03:55.360 --> 03:03:56.360
No, I understand that.

03:03:56.360 --> 03:03:57.360
What the hell is this pyramid thing?

03:03:57.360 --> 03:03:59.360
Really, the movie was made for the fans.

03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:00.360
Yeah, oh yeah.

03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:02.360
I really wish they were due to see more.

03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:04.360
It wasn't very well made on that same line.

03:04:04.360 --> 03:04:07.360
What are the better video game movies, amazingly enough?

03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:10.360
For real, my favorite video game movie, I ain't even going to lie.

03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:12.360
I kind of want to watch it right now.

03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:14.360
I do too, I've been wanting to watch it for like 3's.

03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:16.360
We should go get it on Blu-Ray and then watch it.

03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:19.360
Is it on Netflix? Because then we could party watch it or something like that.

03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:21.360
Do they have that built in yet?

03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:24.360
I don't think they have that feature built in yet.

03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:30.360
We'd call each other and try to press play at the same time and do it that way or something, I don't know.

03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:32.360
That'd be fun, do it on Justin.tv or something.

03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:34.360
Well that worked too.

03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:44.360
Jason, we've got to let you go, take some more calls, but thank you for all you do for the website too. Between you and Deep Man, 2009 is going to be the best year ever for our website. I'm so excited.

03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:46.360
Sure as hell hope so, it's been long enough.

03:04:46.360 --> 03:04:52.360
I am so excited because I'm all jazzed to write again for the website and I know TR has been wanting to do reviews.

03:04:52.360 --> 03:04:55.360
We're actually going to have a functional website and I'm so excited I could tinkle.

03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:56.360
You're jazzed.

03:04:56.360 --> 03:04:58.360
Alright, so we're going to let you go Jason.

03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:07.360
Give me a month to move as we're closing on Tuesday and then I'll do my best to be really, really on top of it.

03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:08.360
You got it buddy.

03:05:08.360 --> 03:05:09.360
Alright, take care.

03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:10.360
Sweet.

03:05:10.360 --> 03:05:11.360
Bye.

03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:12.360
Bye.

03:05:12.360 --> 03:05:17.360
Alright, dang, we've got calls coming in back to back. I think this is going to be the last one though because we're running kind of long tonight.

03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:19.360
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

03:05:19.360 --> 03:05:21.360
It's GS68.

03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:22.360
Hi GS68.

03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:27.360
I was going to say, yeah, we're at three hours between the two parts so far, so we're going to wrap up after this call.

03:05:27.360 --> 03:05:31.360
So, sorry to all the callers that didn't get through, but we ran kind of long tonight.

03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:37.360
I blame Victoria, I don't know why, but it's just she's here and she's just, you know, she's magical.

03:05:37.360 --> 03:05:38.360
She's here and single and beautiful.

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:39.360
Alright.

03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:40.360
Yeah, you two are welcome.

03:05:40.360 --> 03:05:43.360
What's on your mind GS68?

03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:48.360
So, about the whole instance and how the game pretty much played for you.

03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:49.360
Yes.

03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:52.360
There's always something like that in arcade games. It's called unlimited continues.

03:05:52.360 --> 03:05:57.360
Yeah, but you have to feed it a quarter every time you want to continue.

03:05:57.360 --> 03:06:04.360
Well, but at home, if you have free play, you just keep pressing start and you eventually get to the end of the game.

03:06:04.360 --> 03:06:06.360
I mean, no need to use any skill.

03:06:06.360 --> 03:06:11.360
Like playing the Ninja Turtles game on the Xbox, you can just get all the continues you want?

03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:15.360
Yeah, or unlocking free play in Ikaruga.

03:06:15.360 --> 03:06:18.360
In fact, you can even just let the bosses time out.

03:06:18.360 --> 03:06:26.360
That's true, but you know, I also think of the old, you know what you're talking about, kind of reminds me of, could anyone, and I got to ask Loki this, I've got to ask Loki this.

03:06:26.360 --> 03:06:32.360
Could you actually beat Contra on the NES without up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start?

03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:34.360
No, it's fucking hard.

03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:38.360
But that's the point though, you have to be good at it to, it can be done.

03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:42.360
It's just that, you know, you just need, I need to play it more.

03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:46.360
I need to play more to, you know, be able to learn the patterns and that kind of stuff.

03:06:46.360 --> 03:06:55.360
And that's the whole point, it shouldn't be just like, oh look at this, it was super, cause even when we did that, we still didn't beat it, you know, it was fucking hard.

03:06:55.360 --> 03:07:03.360
I don't know, the continues system was kind of an antiquated method of, to have gamers, you know, feed quarters into the machine, that's the whole point.

03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:10.360
You have to start all over again, unless you put it in a quarter, you know, and then just carry it over onto consoles, you know, that's what people were used to.

03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:26.360
If you're supposed to, like, if you want to learn the game, but, I mean, when you're trying to beat the game, I mean, it's, when you're trying to beat the game, I mean, you think continues is kind of like a good point.

03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:30.360
Uh oh.

03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:37.360
I don't know if the internet's acting up again, but you're kind of cutting in a little bit, in and out, so go ahead and say what you want to say.

03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:39.360
And then what else?

03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:43.360
Yeah, I was going to bring up DJ Max Black Square, which I got this week.

03:07:43.360 --> 03:07:54.360
Um, it's alright, I guess, I mean, the songs are pretty good, and they're pretty hard, but I hate the club tour mode, cause some of the missions are, like, really stupid hard.

03:07:54.360 --> 03:08:03.360
And then one feature, and there's Twitter features that really piss me off, one, sometimes, the...

03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:06.360
Andy just dropped, oh no, you there?

03:08:06.360 --> 03:08:13.360
I'm gonna ask real quick, we're having these weird problems tonight, is this the American version that you're talking about, or is this the new one that came out in Korea?

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:15.360
It's Korea.

03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:18.360
Oh, my bad, okay, I didn't know.

03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:26.360
Yeah, uh, basically sometimes the music will cut out and re-continue, but it will lag really badly.

03:08:26.360 --> 03:08:29.360
Or it'll lag, like, a few seconds.

03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:37.360
Um, are there any, like, crazy-ass videos like there were in the earlier games?

03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:48.360
Sure, the pissing me off is this autocorrect feature, basically, if you press the wrong node to play a node, you still get a vast 100% for it.

03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:53.360
I mean, you get 80% of the score, but you still get 100% of the judgement.

03:08:53.360 --> 03:09:00.360
Is it just me, or is the arcade DJ Max and the PSP one kind of, like, really different because of the whole touch element?

03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:01.360
They're really different.

03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:02.360
Um, well, obviously they're different.

03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:05.360
I wonder why they don't do DJ Max on the DS.

03:09:05.360 --> 03:09:07.360
They are, and this is the arcade one.

03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:09.360
Aha! Aha!

03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:14.360
Arcade one, like, sometimes...

03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:18.360
Okay, we're having too many phone problems, so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up the call.

03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:22.360
Sorry, GS68, I don't know if it's your internet connection or our internet connection, but something's up.

03:09:22.360 --> 03:09:28.360
Um, so, yeah, um, DJ Max, you know, it's one of the series I've been...

03:09:28.360 --> 03:09:33.360
One of my friends is really into it and keeps begging me to check it out, so I probably will at some point.

03:09:33.360 --> 03:09:35.360
At least when it comes out in America.

03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:38.360
But I do want to try this arcade version that's at Sunnyvale Golf Land.

03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:40.360
Hopefully it's not gone.

03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:45.360
I guess GS68 was saying in chat earlier that it looks like it's probably gonna be gone by the time I get there.

03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:51.360
So that would suck, because I guess it's in this weird beta test or whatever, so we'll see.

03:09:51.360 --> 03:09:54.360
Anyhow, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us before we wrap up the show?

03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:57.360
Yes, that's what I've been doing.

03:09:57.360 --> 03:09:59.360
Um, some interesting ones.

03:09:59.360 --> 03:10:03.360
Apple has actually rejected a game from Utesato.

03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:06.360
You remember him from the Seaman series.

03:10:06.360 --> 03:10:14.360
Well, he had a game coming out, I think it was like Seaman 2, on the iPhone.

03:10:14.360 --> 03:10:16.360
It was Gabo.

03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:20.360
It was a spiritual successor to Seaman, but with a caveman instead.

03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:28.360
And unfortunately they said, due to unpleasant gameplay, they axed the game and they're not allowed to put it on the App Store.

03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:34.360
I heard about that. That's so weird, because there's a lot of crap on the App Store, so I'm kind of surprised, actually.

03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:37.360
And which is why apples suck.

03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:39.360
You just had to work that in there, didn't you?

03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:40.360
Yes, I did.

03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:44.360
This isn't really a gaming story, but it has a game addict with it.

03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:57.360
Apparently there's a game addict in Beijing who was 23 years old and was rushed to a hospital after swallowing five pieces of saw blades in order to attempt to commit suicide.

03:10:57.360 --> 03:11:06.360
And apparently he had been talking incoherently about how to win his favorite computer games after being sent to a Beijing hospital ICU.

03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:15.360
Yeah, that was another one of those cases where he was a gamer, and that's about the extent that it was related to video games. This guy had issues way beyond video games.

03:11:15.360 --> 03:11:19.360
Well, I just want to talk about swallowing saw blades, and that was kind of neat. That's pretty extreme.

03:11:19.360 --> 03:11:21.360
That is pretty extreme. I'll give you that.

03:11:21.360 --> 03:11:28.360
House of the Dead Overkill is actually getting an official gun attachment for the Wii.

03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:30.360
Only in Europe, though.

03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:42.360
Apparently Amazon UK is taking pre-orders on it right now. It's supposed to ship on February 13th, and it will be priced for 12.99 euros.

03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:44.360
Or pounds or something like that. I think it's euros.

03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:57.360
And they're also going to have a big bang box set that's going to have both that and two of those guns, which they're calling the hand cannons, and they look like pretty sweet guns.

03:11:57.360 --> 03:11:59.360
So that's kind of cool.

03:11:59.360 --> 03:12:12.360
And this is pretty big news. Final Fantasy 13 is coming to Japan in 2009. Of course, we'll be making it out overseas and everywhere else April 2010.

03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:25.360
So April 2010 is the earliest that we'll see Final Fantasy 13. However, I hope that we'll see it a lot sooner, because I will be importing the Blu-ray special edition for Advent Children.

03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:33.360
I want that so bad, but if we have to wait until 2010, then we have to wait until 2010. I guess it's not surprising. It's just a little disappointing.

03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:39.360
Especially because we do these things on the OLR forums, the annual predictions.

03:12:39.360 --> 03:12:43.360
Rob with Two Bees does this thread every year, and he does a really good job tabulating and everything.

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:46.360
And everybody makes their predictions for the year, and we see how many of them come true.

03:12:46.360 --> 03:12:50.360
I've already lost, like, on two of my predictions. I said there'd be a new Rock Band game this year.

03:12:50.360 --> 03:12:57.360
There's not going to be, they've already said, because of the Beatles game, which makes sense. I should have been smarter and known that, that they don't need a new Rock Band game with the Beatles game.

03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:05.360
And also, now this. I said that Final Fantasy 13 would finally come out this Christmas, and now it looks like it's going to be next year.

03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:08.360
I might get half credit for the Japanese release date, though.

03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:15.360
Yeah, and like I said, I'll try to import the Blu-ray for Advent Children, because it's going to have a demo on it.

03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:19.360
Yeah, I totally want to check that out, too. I might even import it for that. We'll see.

03:13:19.360 --> 03:13:23.360
Because the demo's supposed to be like two hours long, they said. Which is pretty crazy.

03:13:23.360 --> 03:13:37.360
CS09! Microsoft has been, apparently was talking to somebody, that they were saying that they were looking to increase the 100 friend limit on Xbox Live.

03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:38.360
Yes, thank God.

03:13:38.360 --> 03:13:53.360
Apparently because it was in place for the original Xbox, it was coded into games, but now since they've moved past the Xbox, they can go ahead and raise it. So maybe in a future update, they will do that. Which would be awesome.

03:13:53.360 --> 03:14:10.360
And let's see here. Also, there's going to be a special edition Final Fantasy VII Advent Children PS3 coming out in Japan. It's in cloud black, and it's got a nice little symbol there etched into the front of it.

03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:28.360
It's one of the 160GB PS3s. It's got a Final Fantasy XIII trail version set, which is with the Final Fantasy XIII demo, I guess. And then Final Fantasy VII Advent Children complete Blu-ray disc set.

03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:51.360
Which would be available for 49,980 yen, approximately $551 US. Very cool. And apparently, those people interested in purchasing Final Fantasy VII Advent Children complete, it does have an English language option.

03:14:51.360 --> 03:15:05.360
So fuck yeah, I'm importing that shit. Awesome. And this is some funny stuff. Duke Nukem Critical Hour is coming along quite well, says 3D Realms. And you may not remember what these are, actually.

03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:29.360
Critical Hour was the game that they're putting out on the PSP. It's a new game trilogy, I guess. And they're also having some on the DS as well. But all I have to say is finish Duke Nukem forever first! Stop going on to new things! Finish one, then you get to work on new games.

03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:50.360
Hey, speaking of Final Fantasy XIII, not to backtrack, but I am. Did you see the new character that was announced this week? Yeah, he's pretty cool looking. Yeah, I know. A lot of people were giving it crap. He's Lando. He looks fine. He looks pretty cool. I love the cute little chocobo he has with him. That's going to be awesome. Anyway, sorry, I just wanted to back, because we didn't mention that during the show either, so I just wanted to throw that out there.

03:15:50.360 --> 03:16:13.360
And then the last thing, EA is prepping a new game called Spore Hero, and of course it will be related to Spore. It's coming out on Wii and DS. Alright, awesome. We're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show, then, and get everybody's final thought and get on out of here. Unfortunately, our stream is crashing left and right, and we're starting to lose listeners because of it, so I think that's a sign that we're probably running too long.

03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:33.360
So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight, but first we're going to go get around everybody's final thought, but I do want to say thank you very much for listening to Orange Lawn Radio this week. If you've enjoyed what you've heard, please tell two friends about our show. You know, it's how we spread the word about our show and get it out there, the little program that we do. So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought. Victoria left the studio to go charge her phone.

03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:49.360
I'm Victoria, and I'm young and I'm single, and I'm sexy. I want to thank her for being on the show tonight and giving her opinion and everything, especially in the first part of the show, although she started to tune out during the second half of the show. Shut up.

03:16:49.360 --> 03:17:05.360
So thank you, Victoria. Rice Princess, thank you for being here tonight. Thanks. And you said quite a bit tonight, especially in regards to Nintendo, so thank you for your input as always. And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? I want to know when the website's going live.

03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:19.360
The website, I don't know. Don't get too excited. It might not be until next month. I got to make sure Deep Man and Jason get it worked out, but we will try to get it up fast. I will do whatever I can to get it working.

03:17:19.360 --> 03:17:35.360
All right. Loki, your final thought tonight? It's cold in here. I know, I haven't been running the heater. It's getting cold in here. Sorry. And my final thought is I need some Auragel. Boo hoo, cry.

03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:55.360
All right. That's it. Thank you guys once again for staying with us all night long, especially you live listeners that have suffered through several outages tonight. Thank you guys as always for your support of Orange Lounge Radio. You know we would just not do this if it weren't for you guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Have an amazing week. We'll see you again next week with Jamie back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
