Tonight, January 25th, 2009, GameTap removes some of its free games, Dawn of War 2 disappears from GameStop, and did Uebo finally win a movie award?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
We do tape live on Sunday nights every week at allgames.com and it's all brought to you by myself, Rob Roberts, and my wonderful co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Worship me!
Back after a week of absence.
What were you doing in your week of absence?
Writing the charter for my cult.
Wonderful.
Yes, this is a conversation carried over from Bobby's show, which can be heard before us Sunday nights live.
Official drink is Propel.
And DarkSakura apparently is going to be fixing the economy by starting a cult.
And somehow this is going to fix the economy.
My plan is brilliant.
Because the companies aren't making enough money because the consumers aren't buying because they don't have money because they've been losing equity in their home and going into foreclosure and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
So I'll tell you what.
Give me all your money.
I will go and pump money back into the economy on my wild spending spree.
Help the banks by getting the biggest mortgage ever, which I will be paying off with your money, of course.
And, you know, personally revitalizing our bank and credit system.
And what about everybody else who's broke because they gave you money?
What are they going to do?
Well, when the economy's better, hi, they'll get new money.
And jobs!
There'll be jobs to accommodate my shopping spree.
You know, whenever I think about cults... And there's more.
With the stuff I decide not to keep any longer after my wild shopping spree, I put it back on eBay.
And all these people who now have jobs to accommodate my needs can buy the stuff off of eBay.
It's brilliant.
And I replenish my money.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Grand Theft Auto 4 The Work
on my PC.
Basically, what it comes down to now is I'm going to have to actually reinstall Windows for it to work.
That's quality developing right there.
Quality.
When a game requires you to reinstall your operating system for it to work correctly.
Good job.
Kudos, Rockstar.
Have you thought about calling customer support or anything?
I post on GTA forums and they have Rockstar Toronto is actually their
Are other people having the problems you're having, or is it just you?
Yeah, some people are having the same problems I'm having, no one's helping them either, and people are also having other problems.
There's a new patch that came out that caused even more problems, so awesome!
What are you talking about?
There's no problems!
Sweep under the rug, sweep under the rug.
Yeah, it's only, it's less than 1% of, yeah, see they pulled the old Microsoft bit where it's all, it's less than 1% of our customers are having problems with Grand Theft Auto 4.
It's just they happen to be the most vocal of the bunch here.
How does it feel to be less than 1%, Loki?
I'm special.
I have three words for you.
Better business bureau.
I have more words for you.
I'm pirating their next game and I'm not buying their shit anymore.
How is that going to hurt them?
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
Because there's nothing I can do.
There's plenty you can do.
Okay, I can call their customer service and they go, oh, I don't know what's wrong.
Oh, you can, you know, send a letter into the CEO.
You can write the Better Business Bureau and file a complaint.
Or he can get on his podcast and tell hundreds of people.
I'm just saying, okay, I'm overestimating our listener base a little bit.
He can tell dozens of people.
This is a problem I have.
I'm just going to say it for the FUs.
I'm just saying, though, I mean, I've been more than...
I've been more than generous to them, I should say.
At our work, we have a LAN set up and everything, and I've purchased copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 on 360 for each one of those systems.
That's five different systems that have that game.
I think overall, I purchased about six copies of that game.
I'd say that's more than generous.
And the fact that I was even...
Thanks for watching!
And yes, and sadly enough, I'll probably be buying the download content that'll be coming out for Grand Theft Auto 4.
And I may even buy the download content for each one of those systems.
That's $100 right there.
But you know what?
I don't know.
I think unless they come out... Because basically what it is now is, oh, well, something in your system is causing it not to work.
Really?
Thanks for narrowing it down to something in my computer causing it not to work.
I was worried that it might have been the birds outside.
You don't want to see me on the phone with customers.
But it's annoying.
I even went and uninstalled and reinstalled Service Pack 3 just to see if maybe that would fix it, but of course not.
Oh, and it doesn't help either that it takes 40 minutes to install Grand Theft Auto.
All right.
Well, hey, our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com is making a request.
Of course, we always like to have the chat room involved during our show tonight.
A request that if Loki does decide to call customer service, please, please record it and play it on a future episode.
But here's my thing.
Here's my thing.
I don't want to go too far into this.
But, I mean, is calling customer service â€“ I mean, a lot of those reps, no disrespect, they do a very thankless job.
I did customer service.
Right.
And I teach for it.
But, you know, they're kind of given a script.
They're given limits.
They can't change a lot at their level.
If he really wants something to happen, he's going to have to get attention of people upstairs.
I'm going through the right routes.
I'm going through GTA forums, and they have the developers on there actually reading people's comments.
So they're supposedly looking into things.
They're supposed to also be...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Period.
Just stops working, and no matter how many times I uninstall it, reinstall it, do whatever, it does not work.
That doesn't make any sense.
DarkSakura's dying to make a comment, and then we gotta move on to Gaming Weeks.
It's actually about customer service.
Yeah.
Rob, have you done customer service yourself?
Oh, well, yeah.
It's the industry I work in.
But have you answered the calls?
Okay.
Yes, of course.
I have to, to be able to teach him.
Well, not necessarily my work, but I did customer service, and I can actually say that script is only good for the first month of the job, and after that, a good rep is going to know their shit, know who to go to, and know how to solve your problem.
Don't get me wrong, especially at the place I work, we've got great reps.
I just say that a lot of times, unfortunately, their hands are a little tied in what they can and can't do.
There's certain processes, procedures, rules in place.
There's only so much they can do.
And they'll do whatever it takes for the people on the line.
But again, I don't work in the video game industry either, and neither do you.
And I think our industries give us a lot more leeway in those types of freedoms than a video game company.
You know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.
It's a little easier for you to investigate alone or my people to get claims paid that need to be or whatever than to fix a game.
You know what I mean?
I don't know if that makes sense.
I don't know.
I just think in their world it's a lot more limiting.
Hey, if you work in that world and care to disagree with us, you can always send us an email.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Yeah, I would actually like to know how video game customer support goes.
I'd actually like to hear more about that too.
I still think that there's way too many parallels from one to the other.
And I've talked to people who've done tech support that there's ways to get the help and ways to get the official answer.
So...
All right, let's move on.
We got to talk about our gaming weeks.
And usually we start off each of us talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week.
But I want to deviate a little bit tonight.
I'm actually going to let Loki start tonight because he checked out a game that I think a lot of our longtime listeners are going to be interested in because it's a music-based game.
He kind of got a sneak preview at this.
I have not heard a lot about this game outside of this show, but I don't know.
Loki, does it look to be something I should be keeping an eye on?
Yes, definitely.
It's a brand new game.
A lot of people may be familiar with DJ Hero, which is supposed to be coming out from Activision later this year.
There was another music game that's also turntable-based that's going to be...
Scratch, The Ultimate DJ
Now what this game is, what makes it kind of unique, is the game relies a lot on actual turntable techniques.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and so on.
and so on.
It's actually a turntable that looks like a Numark turntable.
Then you've got five keys next to it, kind of like a Beatmania arcade-style controller, except they're all in a line, kind of like the Guitar Hero fret buttons, but a lot bigger and kind of nicer looking.
and next to that is actually a crossfader.
So during those sections that you can scratch in, you can actually do real turntable techniques with it and the game will pick up on that and award you points and award you saying, okay, you did this, this, and this.
DarkSakura.com
So yeah, right now it's set to come out in June.
It's going to be about $100 retail.
And PlayStation 3 and 360.
It looks pretty awesome.
It's pretty much everything you would expect from Beatmania.
The controllers, ambidextrous.
They're going to have like 60 songs.
It's licensed hip-hop and R&B, which may not be for everybody.
That kind of turned me off of it at first until I actually saw it being played, and it's pretty cool.
Some of the tracks that I think they have confirmed for it so far, like Flashing Lights by Kanye West, Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Peter Piper by Run DMC.
Woo-hoo!
Hot in Here by Nelly, Milkshake by Killis, Friends by Houdini, Party Like a Rockstar by Shopboys, and Don't Sweat the Technique by Aaron B and Ray Kim.
So basically, you're talking about a game, it looks like Beatmania, and a question coming from our chat is, GS68 is making the Konami will sue joke.
Do you think it's going to be something that's too close to comfort for Konami?
Their controller is different enough, I don't know if they can sue them because of the controller, since it's not just, the way it functions is a little bit different.
Also, the interface itself is different than Beatmania.
The way the screen looks, it's almost like a candy cane, I guess, because kind of towards the left side of the screen, you'll see like a turntable spinning, and the notes come off the turntable, and they kind of turn around, and then they come down like Beatmania would.
But, I mean, it's similar in the way it's played, but I don't know.
I mean, I'm sure they'll try to sue them anyways, but...
Part of the way you described it, though, makes me think that Beatmania and Kraken DJ spawned.
Yeah, with the whole crossfader and everything, it does kind of sound like it's a mix of them.
And the scratching, it's like a love baby of the two.
But no techno.
We have a lot of people in our chat who are in that Beatmania mindset, thinking like, oh, if this game's going to have a Beatmania-style controller, I see Acidic Vampire says, I want techno.
That's the thing.
Techno does not have scratching in it, usually.
That's why they basically stuck to hip-hop.
Could do, though, good drum and bass.
They could, and I don't see why they can't.
I mean, it's just that they're really focusing on music that's going to be scratchable, that you would hear scratching in.
Another cool thing about it is they're going to have a microphone port on it that you'll actually be able to sample yourself or whatever and mix it into the actual songs.
Oh, wiggity, wiggity, whack.
I could see myself yelling that in the microphone over and over.
And some other cool stuff they were saying, that they're going to have some sort of way to play back your performances or something, which is kind of cool.
HIP HOP MANIA
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know, it looks good.
I'd say definitely give it a shot.
There's going to be a lot more stuff coming out about it as it gets closer.
They're going to be really marketing this pretty heavily.
And I think it's going to be a really awesome game.
Because when you consider... Now, because I kept asking about DJ Hero and stuff like that.
The difference between them and DJ Hero is DJ Hero is going to be more... Basically, the aim of the game is to mix two songs together.
Whereas this is actually about scratching.
So...
I don't know.
It looks pretty cool, though, so far.
Let me ask the chat room about this, though.
I'm going to ask a question to chat, and we'll read some of your responses in a minute.
Gil, because I know we have a lot of people that have been listening to us for a long time, so we have a lot of music game fans in chat.
Does this game interest you, even though the music may not be the type of music you're used to in these types of games?
Because I don't think we've had a real... I should say one that can be taken very seriously.
I mean, we've had the, what...
Move It To The Streets or whatever that game was called.
The Dance Battle or whatever.
And we had that one random Xbox Live Arcade game.
I'm talking about, you know, this sounds like it's going to be pretty... Chatroom, are you interested in this game even though it's going to be hip-hop and not techno?
Chatroom.
And I asked the same question to Jamie.
Is this of interest to you?
Not really.
I probably won't play it.
I mean, I'll probably check it out.
But I actually really didn't like Kraken DJ.
And...
I really have no interest in any of that music.
Except for the exception of the two pretty classic ones mentioned, Run DMC and Rakim.
But I really have no interest in that music at all.
I really have no interest in the hip-hop lifestyle, really.
I don't care for it.
I don't really have an interest in the game.
That's my big sticking point, too, is that, you know, it's like, you know, I have an appreciation for some of that, you know, like you say, like the classics and some of those and even the silly dance songs like Milkshake and stuff I get a kick out of.
Yeah, but I don't know.
I kind of worry.
$100 is a lot to ask, but I'll probably give it the benefit of the doubt.
I'm definitely interested in checking it out.
I really want to check it out because, you know, if the interface works well and it's put together well, that's when I think we need to lobby these people to do the techno one we want.
I don't know.
Well, I mean, and they're going to have... Not all of the music's going to be licensed.
I think some of it they're actually making.
So, very well, I don't see why they couldn't do, like, house music or something like that that would have, you know, scratching in it.
I mean, it's just...
I know that there can be some techno songs they could have scratching it, but you would normally not hear a techno artist, if you went to a club, scratching out stuff with it.
It just wouldn't make any sense.
And song lists are so critically important in music games, too.
Why didn't any of us buy Karaoke Revolution Country Edition?
The name of the game one more time, Loki?
All right, let me read some comments from chat, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks with DarkSakura in just a moment.
Again, I asked the chat room, are you interested in this game?
Does this game sound interesting to you, even though it's not the typical type of music you've seen in other music games that have come out here?
YYR says, yes, it does.
ActDeft says it does, but what's turning me off is the price.
Let's see.
Bocci Kawa says, personally, I play beat-bit games for the music, but I have a broad interest when it comes to music.
I'll play it.
YYR says, I would like spinning to music that we could actually hear in a club.
Tiger Class says, probably not, because I don't listen to hip-hop.
Biohaze says, I would only be interested if you could load music from your hard drive and play it from that.
Otherwise, not interested.
Frisbee says, simply, no, not interested.
DarkTetsuya said, yeah, if they had an in-store demo or something, I'd at least try it once.
Um...
Leo Shen says, not really.
Songs kill it for me, to be honest.
Acidic Vampire says, I agree with Dark Tetsuya.
I'd have to try it out first before I can judge it, but I'm not really into hip hop, but it could be fun.
Misty says, I'd probably get it eventually when I can eBay it for like half price.
Milkshake is an in-joke bonus for me.
There you go.
Two words would actually, two words would swing it a little bit for me.
Beastie Boys.
How about 9-1-1 is a joke?
That's some old school public enemy.
Well, I mean, there's going to be like 40 some songs and that's only like six of them.
I mean, like I said, it's five months away.
And we don't even know anything about like DJ Hero.
I mean, that game could be completely lame.
Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be much different other than exchanging out a turntable for the guitar controller.
We're very interested to see what develops.
We definitely have an eye on this game.
Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about games we've had our eyes on this week, or in DarkSakura's case, the past two weeks.
How was your gaming week?
Actually, it was pretty bare because I started school this week.
I pretty much just played some Fable and a little Ragnarok and that was it.
I just really have not had a whole lot of time to play much of anything else.
School does that, doesn't it?
Oh, I played some Katamari on my phone, but I kept getting interrupted, so I haven't gotten past the first stage.
And lots of solitaire.
Awesome.
Loki.
And I finished a book.
What's that?
V, The Second Generation.
How was that?
That was freaking amazing.
You've talked a lot about V. Book review.
Okay, quick.
For those that don't know what V is...
V, it was a series that came on in the early 80s about these visitors from outer space who came trying to be, you know, on the surface they were friendly.
It turned out they're trying to steal all of our water and eat everybody.
And they were really lizard people underneath.
And you can actually rent the DVDs.
But the creator of the first series did not like how they continued the series when they did the TV series in V, The Final Battle.
So he actually wrote a book about
about what the world would be like 20 years after what he envisioned going on happened and it's it's like watching it reads like watching the episodes it's very very visual and you know in far as how it's been in the description and it's just a fantastic book so if anyone's a fan of V get the book just get it get it get it and yes Robert England was in V he was in there as Willie and that character is in the book
That was a question from our chatroom, AsceticVampire.
Very nice.
Who knew that you were going to get a book review?
I'm fucking literal, okay?
I love reading.
Books are fun.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
Books are fundamental.
Books are fun to burn.
Just kidding.
How was your gaming week, Loki, outside of scratch?
Not very well.
It's just a grant the thought of forth.
That's basically it.
Just played it at work.
But not on your PC.
yeah most definitely not on my PC yeah that's basically it unfortunately I wanted to play some other things I keep trying to go back to Fable 2 and I really need to finish and there's no way I'm going to finish it in time Lost Odyssey because god damn it if Star Ocean is not coming out in like a month from now I'm not going to ever finish Lost Odyssey
I didn't know you were a big Star Ocean fan.
I'm not a big Star Ocean fan, but it looks awesome.
I've not played any of the Star Ocean games.
The first one was okay.
I didn't finish it.
I guess I'm the only one that actually played quite a few games this week.
Well, actually, I shouldn't say that because I pretty much spent all of my gaming time on one game.
But I actually spent a lot of time, like for me, a large amount of time on Fable 2, which is kind of one of those games I meant to check out last year.
But, you know, the holidays are so busy.
There were some games I said, look, I'm not going to get to these games until January, February.
Loki was good enough to loan me a copy of Fable 2.
A legit copy.
Thank you.
Based on what we talked about earlier in the show, this was a legit copy.
It's a lot of fun.
I'm having way more fun with this one than I did the first game.
Are you being evil?
DarkSakura.com
and how Nintendo is going to be putting this, you know, they patented, I should say, not necessarily putting this in, but patenting this mode where you're going to be able to just, at a touch of a button, get little videos that help you with the game and even just skip right over certain parts of the game or watch them played for you.
It's like basically turning games into movies or whatever.
And Loki was very vehemently, like, against this, saying, like, I'm not going to buy the game.
But what struck me as funny
Fable 2 is almost one step away from that.
Because that little gold path really makes it easy to know where to go.
But you have the option of turning it off.
That is true.
You can turn it off.
And you can also turn this other thing off we were talking about last week.
Until I learned the world well enough, I actually kind of needed it.
Oh, I still definitely need it, but I veer from the path all the time because I'm always afraid I'm going to miss treasures.
But the fantastic thing about this game is it reminds me a lot of Oblivion, which is a game I really loved because there was just like an open world, do whatever you want, go wherever type of thing.
But, you know, it has that multiplayer aspect to it, and it's kind of in a much different art style, a much different presentation.
Well, the most important question about this, Rob.
What'd you name your dog?
Wienerschnitzel.
I named mine Dumbass.
Did you?
Because the dog is stupid.
Bark, bark, bark!
What?
I already got that treasure box, stupid!
But I don't know, I'm having a lot of fun with the game, just kind of running around and doing stuff and dancing for villagers and trying to get people to marry me, although it hasn't been successful so far.
I guess I'm just not dancing enough, or what?
There's something that you need to do, Rob.
An achievement that you need to unlock, and this is one that Tiara told me about.
Okay.
When you get the pelvic thrust emote, then you need to go to the sheriff in the marketplace, strip naked...
Target him and do the pelvic thrust What happens?
Do you get thrown in jail for loot?
You find a thousand gold and you get an achievement for it
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, the game's very adult.
You can get the polygamist.
I searched the drawers in one house, the cabinet or whatever, and I found a condom.
I was like, wow, this game's kind of adult nature.
I dug a hole in the ground and found condoms, okay?
It's so stupid.
I was like, I don't want this.
Ew.
Who would bury condoms in the ground?
Goddammit.
Dumbass the dog.
Wow, dumbass the condom-sniffing dog.
Amazing.
That's it.
We have to do a Fable webcomic.
The Adventures of Little Sparrow and Dumbass the Dog.
Although I'm going by Master Chief because I have the special edition.
But yeah, I've just been having fun just kind of messing around.
The one thing I noticed about Fable 2, your character never has to sleep.
Like, ever.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Right now my character needs to seriously buy a lot of celery.
For what?
Because she's been eating meat pie.
And she's a little chubby.
Actdeft in chat says, VGCats beat you to that webcomic idea and link to VGCats recent edition.
I'll have to look at that a little later.
The rest of my gaming week, I have some news that might come as a bit of a shock to some of our regular listeners.
I made a conscious decision this morning to cancel my World of Warcraft account.
Why are you applauding that?
Don't be mean.
We'll see how long it lasts.
She's skeptic.
No, but just, yeah.
I canceled it.
I don't need to say much more.
Nothing anybody did in-game.
No drama, nothing like that.
But just kind of the thing that it really was starting to feel like.
Even I was starting to go, I'm playing this game too much.
So I pulled the plug.
Because I can do that.
I have enough self-control where I can do that.
I might not have much.
but I had enough where I was finally just able to recognize, you know what, I'm starting to treat this like a second job.
I need to step away.
I need to level up in real life for a little while.
That's my big shocking news.
Yeah, we'll see how long it lasts.
I know.
Be skeptical.
It's fine.
I deserve it.
Especially after quitting and going back to Final Fantasy XI.
But I do want to make it clear, I did not quit World of Warcraft to go back to Final Fantasy XI.
I can safely say I have had lulls, but I'm still playing Ragnarok online after eight years.
Nine years, sorry.
You know what?
And now that I'm finally done with WoW for the foreseeable future, I should actually go check out Ragnarok for a little bit.
But I also, here's the problem.
I don't want to ditch one MMO and then just go play another MMO.
The good thing about Ragnarok, though, is it really, especially if you play on a private server, it's just like, oh, whatever.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll do this.
Okay, I'm done.
It's not like, oh, grind!
Ah!
Oh, actually, Rob, I'll tell you what, I'm actually going to be joining another private server for a different game.
We are starting VOL Army on Phantasy Star Online.
Really?
Another blue burst server.
Are those still around?
They are, and they have all the Japanese quest updates, and people are translating them.
Weird.
Is it official, or is it all under the table bootleg stuff?
It's all under the table, but Sega don't care.
Sega was actually letting you transfer some of your characters over.
I really liked Phantasy Star Online, and you don't get that immersed in that, you know what I mean?
Yeah, it's something that you can sit and play through a little bit.
You can play it all day if you want to, you can play it a little bit if you want to.
And you can also kick rappies, which is fantastic.
I hate rappies.
So, you should do that.
Alright, SSJ100Matt suggesting I go back to DDR.
Actually, I would love to play DDR, but they don't really have a machine around here.
We should play.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
A new little game.
It's called Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
And it's like a DDR clone thing.
I believe it's like an expansion you actually load into Step Mania or something like that.
Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix, the demo or what have you, was released.
And you can load it into Step Mania.
It's all these in-jokes from Orange Lounge Radio, but now in DDR.
Like they have Still Alive as one of the songs.
And then, I don't know, some recording of me singing a DDR song from like
What?
What?
My people.
My people.
My people.
Alright, anyhow.
Let's go ahead and get into gaming news.
We haven't talked anything about gaming news yet.
Let's please get into that.
What?
Oh yeah, we touched scratch.
That was more of like a gaming exclusive.
Let's get into the news that you read everywhere else on the internet now.
Of course, we are big fans of Katamari and Takahashi's brand new game, Nobi Nobi Boy, which I still don't know what exactly you have to do in this.
But ironically, Katamari is not fans of us.
Yes.
How I forget.
How 2006 of me, I know.
I know.
Anyways, Nobi Nobi Boy will be available on the PlayStation Network February 19th.
It is coming out at a whopping $5.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All the combined, basically everybody in the world that's playing this game contributes to her getting longer and after she gets so long, it unlocks a new level for you.
So everybody is kind of working to unlock new levels.
That's just a cute idea.
The world, the clouds look like tasty fluffy donuts.
Don't talk about food, you're gonna make me hungry.
Are they talking about releasing a demo or anything so I can at least try this game out?
Or am I just going to have to basically throw $5 into the wind and hope that just because it has the Katamari guy's name on it, it's cool?
There's no mention of a demo at all, but most of the PSN games do get demos.
Some do not, but most of them do.
Whatever happened to him making childhood playground equipment?
I think he has.
Interesting.
And you know, I don't want to know what his playground equipment looks like since he always comes up with these crazy things that eat things and roll over things and absorb them.
Probably kind of scary.
It's like Takahashi's Borg playground equipment.
Become one.
Assimilate into the playground equipment.
Well, also on PlayStation Network, LittleBigPlanet has not released anything in a little while.
They had that big Metal Gear Solid thing right before Christmas, and they were kind of on holiday break.
But they are coming back, apparently, on January 26th, I believe, which is tomorrow?
I think that might be over in the UK, I don't know.
But basically as of this next week, you're going to start to see some new costumes show up on the PlayStation Network.
It starts with the Chinese New Year costumes.
Oh, I see.
They come out on January 26th.
The rest of the costumes go with the regular updates.
The cool thing is the Chinese New Year costumes are going to be free.
They haven't said exactly how much the other packs are going to cost, including a Groundhog Day costume, a Valentine's Day mini pack, an Ape Escape costume, and a Toro costume.
Both of which are from Japan.
And a Wipeout costume kit.
Which is kind of interesting.
But what I also thought was, and caught my eye, was on January 29th, with the Groundhog Day costume, a God of War mini-pack is coming out with a Kratos costume.
And I don't know if that means a God of War level thing, which it sounds like it might be.
That would be the download content that was available if you pre-ordered the game at GameStop.
That's the other thing I'm wondering.
Or is it just the... I got one of those.
Even though I didn't pre-order the game, they gave me the slip anyway.
It was only a costume.
It wasn't a lot of other stuff.
There were stickers also that were with it, I think.
Maybe there were, I just don't remember.
Because remember the big controversy was someone made a God of War level with those stickers and it got banned from there?
Well then if that's coming out, where's the Heavenly Sword and all the other stuff that was supposed to come out too?
That's my other question.
Well, later.
I guess so.
But I guess this would be a sign for those that got frustrated because they didn't get the pre-order bundle.
They will be able to get the content, although you can bet you it's going to cost money.
You can betcha it'll cost money.
Especially in this economy.
They gotta make money wherever they can, right?
I guess so.
But, you know, money is...
Wonderful.
I was going to say running short and the recession is hitting.
It's really on a worldwide basis.
Eidos closed their Manchester studio so that they can do just the big name games instead of developing smaller ones.
They want to put as high quality titles that will deliver long term franchise value.
whatever um so basically it's just 14 people and all they did was make mobile games um but still for those 14 people you know and there's been a lot of you know just cutback news across the industries every week we're reporting on something and you know uh
I know when we were doing the call earlier with Bobby Blackwolf from the show before us you know he's been joking about how his show is just one it's been one downer after another not you know because it's bad content but just the news has just been layoff layoff layoff and then even you know what I don't know if you guys know this I think we talked about a little on the show last week but there was the Gamerscore blog at Xbox site that you know they did a lot for the community and in fact they were a big reason why
That's just... eugh.
It's especially kind of, ooh, kind of hits you right in the gut when some of these people were famous for the podcasts and vidcasts that they had developed that caught Microsoft's eye and hired them on.
And some of them had relocated themselves out there.
And unfortunately, the world works in mysterious ways.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Although, you know, are getting laid off and stuff, hopefully when things settle down and the economy starts to come back, because what goes down must go back up eventually, people are going to find something they really, really like and hopefully it won't be such a bad thing.
So that's my little philosophical moment for the day.
Sorry to be Miss Sunshine, but you know, I'm just a ray of freaking sunshine today, aren't I?
You're pooping rainbows.
Somehow I don't think I'd be welcomed in your cult.
Pooping rainbows.
Sure, you can poop some rainbows in my cult.
Right.
That's what I'll do.
Bob is the high priest of rainbow poop.
Well, you make it sound so dignified.
Alright, anyway.
Sorry to those 14 folks.
Hopefully they'll bounce back eventually.
Yeah.
Well, in other fun news, there's another PSP firmware update.
Hooray!
You may remember there was an exploit that was recently discovered using GripShift that would allow people to run homebrew on a PSP 3000 system.
Well, you can imagine that this new...
5.03 firmware addresses security vulnerabilities and basically it's layman's terms for we fixed the grip shift exploit now you can't do it anymore so if you want to run homebrew onto your you know PSP 3000 I suggest that you don't update your system yet and just wait for them to find another way the few more days before they figure out a way to put a custom firmware onto the PSP 3000 and then it won't matter how many days has it been since this came out
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Then, you know, any other updates like, say, a 5.1 or 5.2 or something like that that change a few things, add a couple features.
Those they can incorporate pretty easy because they normally don't change the firmware too much from update to update.
They're just adding different things or updating different PRXs and stuff.
There's a countdown that everyone thought that was Zelda.
Oh, okay, I see.
Well, what it is, it actually ends up being a game that 30 plays a significant thing in the game because you play four different games, but you play them 30 seconds apiece.
each of the four games has their own character, their own mode like one of them is a side scroller, one of them is a shooter one of them is a strategy game and one of them is an action game but you play them 30 seconds at a time and there's I guess some type of clock in the middle of the screen and then after the 30 seconds is up you go to another mini game
I don't know, but a game like WarioWare that's made up of nothing but 30 second games is actually kind of cool.
So this could be very interesting.
I don't know.
It's very Japan.
But I wonder if they'll bring it over here.
Looks like it could be kind of cool.
GameGuru says so it's WarioWare with less games.
I don't know, not necessarily.
It could be that the mini-games are all different types of side-scrolling games, different types of shooting games.
But I would say it's like a WarioWare meets an RPG, like Actdeft says.
Sounds a little bit like it.
I don't know.
It'll be hard to say until I can actually play the game, right?
So, we'll see.
That'll be coming out eventually.
Well, here's something for...
Rumor mill, if we don't mind.
Actually, I'm sorry, that's not a rumor mill.
I was looking at the wrong story.
Well, no.
I'm just pissed off over my USB gloves.
They're not warming up.
I have USB handwarming gloves.
How exactly hot can USB handwarming gloves get?
They get freaking hot because I've got the cheap shitty ones that don't have any padding on the inside.
So it's like, I'm going to burn your palms now.
So I have to use them with my USB hub and they don't get as hot using my hub.
Anyway, so how about some Wipeout Love?
Wipeout
The PSP, as you know, just want to PS2 PS2, sorry Bringing Wipeout to PS2 It's actually got the information from a European release list So, hey, maybe that could be it It's actually Wipeout Pulse, sorry And also, other things on that particular list One of them is Fat Princess to be out in March I really don't know
Wipeout Pulse is the PSP going to the PS2?
That makes sense then.
Alright, well, we'll see.
I mean, I like the Wipeout games.
I have the download one.
I have the NegCon.
I'm glad to have another reason to use it.
Well, there's some other games coming out in case you can't wait until March.
This week there's a few games starting off with MLB Front Office Manager on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.
Kind of the baseball take on NFL Head Coach.
Also on PS3 and Xbox 360, Afro Samurai coming to us from Namco Bandai.
Looks pretty cool.
Very bloody.
movie tie-in game Coraline coming out on the Wii and PS2 I don't think there's a DS for that looks okay on DS, Imagine Cheerleader yet another game geared towards girls and then kind of a neat little DS game The Chase, Felix meets Felicity this is supposed to play a little bit like Kirby's Canvas Curse
DJ Max Fever on PSP this week
and some games that people are not waiting for JoJo's Fashion Show for the DS and Pets Horses Ranch on DS as well and also supposedly this week although I think it's next week Rygar the Battle of Argus on the Wii
And that is it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And I don't recognize any of these songs.
I realize DJ Max fans recognize these songs in the Korean version of the game.
But they already import the Korean version.
You have to understand, you are like the minority of the minority of the minority of video game buyers.
Okay?
Like, the rest of those people, what is going to be the incentive for them to buy this game?
You know what I mean?
There is no incentive.
And I know, and some people scoff.
What, licensed songs in DJ Max?
Well, do they want to sell it or not?
I mean...
I'm kind of surprised that with them trying to put out this game in the US, they don't want to give me something I would know.
Again, I respect DJ Max, I understand why he has such a loyal following and all that stuff, but they're not going to win over any new people with this strategy.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
I guess that's just me.
Oh, I just like to add before you start Japanese release dates.
And this kind of ties in with Japanese release dates.
I pre-ordered the Blu-ray of Advent Children.
The one with Final Fantasy XIII.
The demo.
And I'm having that bitch overnighted when it comes out.
Nice.
When does that come out?
April.
That's going to be awesome.
We will have Final Fantasy...
DarkSakura.com
I think he did Saw 2 and 3 and all that.
I think those movies are kind of dumb.
But this movie was awesome.
It's like a 70s glam rock, but it's like an opera and it's a horror movie.
It's amazing.
Anyway, I just wanted to say that because you saying Blu-ray reminded me of that.
Comments from chat.
I went on that thing about DJ Max.
GS68, who I know is a big DJ Max fan.
He called and did the review on the arcade version before on the show.
GS68 says, it's DJ Max.
I don't expect licensed song.
Yeah, I know you don't, but again, you're the minority.
Surely you understand that.
It's just like back in the day, there weren't that many licensed songs in DDR, whereas fans of DDR didn't care if they brought out a DDR game over here that had no licensed songs, just all Konami artists.
If you're trying to expand your audience or bring it over to basically introduce people that haven't played,
DJ Maxx.
It's easier to do that with songs that they may recognize.
They can go, hey, oh, this is in there.
I can play this.
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be successful.
I mean, look at Beatmania, which tried to do that as well, and that didn't work out too well.
So, I don't know.
Well, okay, but the thing is, though, that, you know, again, DDR didn't really gain steam here until well into the PlayStation 2 mixes.
You know what I mean?
Like, we had that first mix on PlayStation, which was, you know, even the fans laughed at it.
Konomics, which was basically fan service, nothing but.
Then we started getting into, like, you know, DDR Max on the PlayStation 2.
And then really, I think probably about Max 2 was when we really started to see, like, a lot more licensed songs in the U.S.
DDR games.
And that's also when the game took off.
Really took off.
You know, the first few games showed that it was probable.
Maybe the same thing will happen with DJ Max.
I don't know.
But we'll see.
Anyway, sorry.
I think if anything, what will help DJ Max will be DJ Max Technica when it comes out on the DS.
And if they decide to bring that over here.
Because there's a lot more people that play the DS and...
Ninja Blade on the Xbox 360 January 29th
It's pretty fun.
As well as Tom Clancy's End War and Tomb Raider Underworld come out on the Xbox 360.
Heading over to the PlayStation 3, Tomb Raider Underworld also shows up in Japan, as well as Lost Planet Extreme Condition getting a price reduction.
Again, that's in Japan.
Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time.
I anticipate there'll probably be a few people who'll want to import that sucker.
That finally shows up on the Nintendo Wii.
It's been forever.
Wasn't Crystal Chronicles supposed to be a launch game?
Yeah.
And then it's kind of changed quite a bit.
On the PlayStation 2, hey, funny, wouldn't you know it, Dance Dance Revolution X gets its debut in Japan this week on the PlayStation 2.
And the Japanese versions are always better somehow.
AR Tenelico 2, Melody of Metaphalica Premium Edition comes out.
See, you didn't butcher that like I did last week.
What?
I said he didn't butcher that like I did last week.
Oh, sorry.
Soul Eater Battle Resonance comes out in Japan.
Do you want?
What is this game all about?
It's based off of a manga that's pretty hardcore cool.
Cool.
Trying to build the ultimate weapon.
Also a game called Harukanaro Toki no Naka de Yumi no Kuhihashi comes out.
Special comes out as well.
I have no idea, but that's from Koei, so I bet anything it's some type of RPG game.
It was previously released on the Nintendo DS to celebrate Koei's 30th anniversary.
Some more scenes that now have voiced and all that, so it's a DS game upgrade.
On the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time also gets its release on the DS this week in Japan.
Civilization Revolution gets a localized release for Japan, as well as a game called Vampire Kishi DS comes out from D3.
Sims 2 gets a price reduction over in Japan, if you haven't checked that out yet and you want to.
and lastly on the Sony PSP, Memories Off number 5, Togireta Film comes out as well as Princess Maker 4 Portable gets a price reduction.
But probably the price reduction you're more interested in is Rockman Dash and Rockman Dash 2 coming out together in a value pack this week in Japan.
Also, by the way, actually a couple other games, Soul Eater Battle Resonance gets released on the PSP and Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2.
There you have it, your Japanese release dates.
Let's move on over to the kingdom that is united.
The UK.
Yes.
Actually, really not a whole lot of anything.
Two games on the 30th.
Cake Mania 2 and The Chase Felix Meets Felicity.
Cake Mania.
And Felix Meets Felicity.
These sound like real winners.
Yes.
Chase is supposed to be pretty good.
If it's Felix the cat.
No, it's the Chase.
It's that one that's coming out in the US also.
It looked okay.
It's different, but is different appreciated?
Not always.
I don't know.
Alright, there you have it.
UK release dates.
Something else that might be appreciated is the new PopCap game, Peggle.
Well, it's not that new, but it's new to Xbox Live Arcade.
It's supposed to be coming out in the first half of 2009, if I were to guess, probably March, since I think that's when the DS version comes out.
And that's also when the new PopCap Arcade hits, Volume 2, which also features Peggle.
So it makes sense that it would come out before that.
Ha ha.
Hmm.
There's logic for you.
No word on what the price is going to be.
Apparently people are thinking though that it's going to be 800 Microsoft points.
Makes perfect sense because I think all the other PopCap games were also 10 bucks.
Did you hear about the leak on Twitter about the iPhone version of Peggle?
I don't think that's really a leak.
Yeah, I thought that news was kind of already out there, but apparently they made a tweet about the iPhone pay goal, which, by the way, I believe was in response to our very own DJ Tyrant, who used to do a show on our old station.
I remember, because I follow PopCap and DJ on Instagram.
Twitter, and he said something about like I was just playing Peggle, the game is fun or something like that, I wish I had it on the iPhone or whatever, and then PopCap I think made that response, I don't remember, I'm sorry if I'm misappropriating this information, but I remember it came up right after that conversation, is that PopCap made this tweet like, oh yeah, it's going to come out on the iPhone, and then the tweet disappeared and all the game blogs jumped on it but I was always kind of like, I thought they had already said that Peggle was going to come out on the iPhone, I mean, duh
Rob, do you watch much CNN?
I read CNN.com, but I don't watch, like I reload that a lot at work, but I don't watch the station.
I want to say, I think it's the Situation Room, but one of the programs on there actually reads comments off Twitter, the CNN Twitter, and responds to comments about stories that are going on.
Yeah, we used to do that.
Kind of like how we use our chat room.
Yeah, it's crazy.
We used to do the Twit thing, but we stopped.
Actually, you know what's funny?
I was going to bring back the Twitter thing tonight.
And I'm not just saying that.
Look, I already had it reloaded.
Already here on the screen, ready to go.
I was going to do it during the break.
Alright, alright.
I was just going to say, yeah.
We are bringing back the Twitter interactivity today.
There are things that I normally post on my Twitter that are news related.
Thank you for reminding me.
I completely forgot about it.
What did you post on your Twitter?
Can I go back and read them on air?
Go right ahead.
I don't care.
Um...
Let me see.
Because I don't remember.
Sometimes, a lot of the things you write on Twitter, you've already told me about in the past.
Sometimes.
You talked about Scratch.
Oh!
Oh, the Lego game!
Nobody caught that one, huh?
No.
You figured out Lego Rock Band is shit, and you know what the new Lego game is.
Yeah.
You want to find out?
Go find Loki's Twitter.
I'm not going to read it for you.
It's probably just one of them.
All right.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Nothing Else Matters, One, Seek and Destroy, Memory Remains, hopefully with Marianne Faithfull intact because that song is awesome because of her.
The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Whiplash.
Some other artists that are showing up in the game, Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Foo Fighters, Judas Priest, Leonard Skitterd.
Is it Turn the Page?
Yeah, it's Turn the Page.
Why don't they just do Metallica's cover?
I don't know Leonard Skinner is in it Motorhead Ace of Spades Yes, Ace of Spades Queen with Stone Cold Crazy You know what?
I just figured it out What?
Those are all songs that Metallica has covered I think a lot of these are, yeah
The Garage Inc.
album, remember?
Oh, that's right.
I know they've done Stone Cold Crazy.
Because I've got it on my phone.
Shit.
They've done the other one.
Ace of Spades?
I don't remember if they did Ace of Spades, but I know that they did Turn the Page.
Because that's one of my favorite covers of that song ever.
Also Slayer, Social Distortion, System of a Down, Thin Lizzy, lots of stuff in here.
I do want to also mention, this is what I thought was kind of interesting also.
If you have the download content that was the Death Magnetic CD for download, it will actually work the 10 tracks into the game's campaign mode.
If you already own World Tour on Wii or PlayStation 2, you'll get Broken, Beaten, Scarred, Cyanide, and My Apocalypse.
They'll already be on the disc for you since download content is kind of different on Wii and PlayStation 2.
I thought that kind of interaction was interesting.
And they also announced that the game will be coming on PS3 and Xbox 360 at the end of March on the 29th and then the PS2 and Wii later.
You know, now the question, this isn't set up like World Tour with the other instrument setups or anything, is it?
No, it is.
It's basically with all, like Rock Band now.
Well, damn it.
I'm going to have to buy it.
Because it's Metallica.
Wow.
What role will Metallica play in your cult?
The official band of the universe.
All right.
Not interested.
Sorry.
Yeah, I quit your cult.
No, I'm just kidding.
I thought ABBA got to be the official band of the universe.
I'm very disappointed.
ABBA gets official pop band of the universe.
All right.
Fair enough.
See, that would be a game right there.
Tweak62 says 80s Metallica is great.
90s Metallica is pretty okay.
They should have a game where 80s Metallica battles 90s Metallica and see who wins.
How about ABBA versus Metallica?
That should be a game.
Alas, Abba, we knew you well.
As you get stomped in the face by Lars Ulrich.
No, all Abba would have to do is dress Metallica.
Alright, anyway.
Let's move on with more news.
Do we gotta?
Of course.
It's what we do on this show.
I don't know if you heard.
Virtual Console!
Hey, hey.
There's stuff out.
And this is UK stuff, right?
I like stuff.
Coming out to Virtual Console in the UK is Mario Golf for 1,000 Wii Points because it was a Nintendo 64 game.
And Wonder Boy and Monster Land from the Sega Master System, which will be 500 Wii Points.
You know what's funny?
We were just playing that like...
Dan brought out the Master System.
We were just playing this the other day.
Very cool.
I haven't been following Virtual Console in the U.S.
What did we get?
Do you remember?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't buy anything on Virtual Console.
I haven't either.
It's been a long time.
Actually, I haven't fired up the Wii in a while either, now that I've ruined Animal Crossing for my wife again.
Did your wife officially quit Animal Crossing?
Yeah, she's done with it because I ruined it for her.
I started cheating.
Sorry to hear it.
It's because, you know, I got bored with it.
There's nothing more I can really do.
What else was there to do but cheat?
Exactly.
It's fun to cheat.
It's fun to steal.
Especially when those animals piss you off because they're being just assholes, and you just go into their house and steal all their shit.
It's like, ha!
How do you steal their stuff?
There's a code where you can pick up their stuff, furniture, move it around.
The only thing is it doesn't save it, I don't think, so you can't just do that.
But it did, sort of, in the game that we played, because I stole all the stuff and they had, like, crap on the floor and I was just, like, random junk that...
You know what I would love to see?
It's been a while since we've had an OLR dream game.
I would love to see a game that kind of takes that art style of Animal Crossing or what have you and mixes it with Grand Theft Auto.
I'm on the same page with you.
When a villager pisses me off, I want to put a hit on him.
So what you're basically saying is you would like to see a game that's like Grand Theft Auto.
Don't even say Happy Tree Friends because that shit ain't going to cut it.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
or something like that.
Or animal taking.
I want to be able to kidnap animals.
Alright, anyway.
Let's move on.
Other virtual console news, I guess.
Yes.
Anyways, so... There's a brand new game coming out.
It's almost like I made it or something, but it's not.
It's called Super Meat Boy.
And it's co-created by Edmund McMillan.
And apparently...
Not really sure what it is.
I guess it's a Flash game, kind of similar to N Plus.
And it'll be coming out to the Virtual Console sometime soon, apparently.
SuperMeatBoy.com
What if instead of calling it Super Meat Boy, they called it Super Bacon Boy?
This game would be the top... It doesn't look like bacon.
It would be the top selling... Well, they need to go back and edit the sprites or something and make it Super Bacon Boy.
Because it would be the top selling WiiWare game ever.
Like, even more than Strong Bad and all that stuff.
Super Bacon Boy.
That was a big mistake, whoever made that decision to change bacon to meat.
But, uh, yeah.
Apparently it's extremely hard
Well, I guess it'll be a challenge then.
If you don't cut it, you don't cut it.
Rob, give me a pretzel.
Stop making bad jokes and I will.
Andrew's not here to do it for us.
No more free handouts, says GameTap.
And it happened on Thursday.
They removed 97 games from the free lineup of games.
But look, in this economy and with the whole changing of the hands that went on over at GameTap, right, because Metabully bought them out or whatever, or I think they went up for sale and Metabully bought them, you knew some changes were going to come.
That's two-thirds of the free games are gone, including some games like Art of Fighting.
Baseball Stars Professional, Bust a Move Again, Twinkle Star Strikes, Rainbow Islands, so on and so on.
No more free handouts for you.
However, it should be pointed out, you can still play these games on GameTap.
You just have to pay for it.
You know what?
This makes me even more not want to use our service.
I was actually considering signing up for GameTap, and now there's no point.
Well, the games are there.
You just have to pay for them now.
I was going to pay for other games, but I don't want to play for shit I already own.
Which is damn near everything on that list.
At least the good ones.
I'm going to be honest.
I used to talk a lot about GameTap on the show, but I did finally cancel my account a few months ago.
I just wasn't playing it enough.
But now that I'm not playing WoW, who knows?
I might have to go back.
We'll see.
And plus, I was a little sad I couldn't play Myst Online anymore.
Even though it was weird, the game was very weird, there was something about it that made me want to play it once in a while.
I have something that you should play.
I found my DVD copy of Pissed.
God.
It's the parody of Myst.
I've actually remembered that game, sadly.
Somewhere I've got Monty Python.
It's a complete waste of time.
Alright, I've got a few more stories for you guys and we're going to get to our break tonight.
Well, this next story is Lost Planet.
News on the sequel, finally?
News on the movie.
Oh, now this is what Capcom spent their whole E3 talking about, right?
They are saying that it's going to cost between $150 to $200 million dollars.
and that's just a crazy, crazy, crazy ass budget.
However, you know why it's going to be completely awesome?
It's written by David Hayter.
The voice of Solid Snake.
Wasn't Titanic made for like $180 million or something?
Like, in that Pearl Harbor movie, was that it?
That cost like a shit ton of money to make.
It cost like $200 million.
This one's written by David Hayter.
It's just, I understand that, but most moviegoers have no idea who the fuck he is.
He might be like a prince in your cult or whatever.
The first X-Men movie.
Oh, that's right, he did.
Fuck yeah, he did.
He was a good one.
I stand corrected.
But still, that's a big budget.
That's a big risk.
I hope it pays off for him.
I hope so, because it's David Hader.
And also it's directed by the guy who did Spider-Man.
Sam Raimi?
Avi, I read the... Sorry, produced, not directed.
I was going to say.
Now we're talking Army of Darkness here.
No, I meant produced.
Alright, we'll see.
Sorry, I was checking out Super Meat Boy.
It's exactly like N+.
You were playing with your meat, Loki?
Yes, I was playing with my meat.
It's exactly like...
During the show... Loki, I know.
So unexpected of me.
Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.
There was an announcement made this week.
Remember everyone was saying, hey, what happened to the Indiana Jones game?
Well, that Indiana Jones game that they were showing us before, not coming out, at least right now...
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings
so that's pretty cool apparently though they said that it's also been rated for the PSP and possibly they're thinking PS2 because if it's coming to the PSP they pour a lot of games over to the PS2 anyways so very very cool
And it's translated to this.
Exactly.
Well, that's what it is, a golden raspberry award.
And I think they literally dip something in cheap gold plating or something and they valued the award at like $5 or something like that.
Well, they give away these Razzie awards to the worst of the worst movies of the year.
And I think I read somewhere this year The Love Guru got nominated for more Razzies than any other movie.
That was that Mike Myers movie that came out during the summer.
A lot of people...
Thank you for watching!
Now, he might win that, but it might, you know, Love Guru did get 10 nominations, so it might beat it.
But here's the other thing you should recognize.
Uwe Boll has been guaranteed an award at the ceremony.
He is going to earn the Lifetime Recognition Award of Worst Career Achievement.
This is all the clap he earns.
Linda Blair has earned this award.
Erwin R. Allen earned this award.
And Ronald Reagan once earned this award as well.
Because remember, he was an actor before he did all that other stuff.
So Uwe Boll is going to be getting a type of Lifetime Achievement Award from the Razzies for his shit-tacious films.
Awesome.
Congratulations to Uwe Boll for finally getting recognized with a Hollywood Movie Award.
Now he can say, but now, see, now he can say the award winning Uwe Boll in his movies.
Yeah, he won shit.
There he goes.
They should just poop and dip it in gold and give it to him.
They just might.
But now the question is, will he show up to collect it in person?
Because some people have a sense of humor about it.
Very few people go to collect their awards in person.
But Halle Berry actually showed up the year she won Worst Actress and Catwoman.
She actually showed up to collect the award in person and told off the people in the crowd, but in a joking way.
And that's cool that she could be self... She recognized that the movie was shit and could kind of make fun of herself.
Like, you know...
You always have to kind of laugh at that.
And if I recall correctly, didn't Uwe Boll show up at Penny Arcade Expo in 07?
Or something like that?
Like when they couldn't get Jack Thompson, they got Uwe Boll and he came out on stage?
I mean, with all the shit that guy gets, that takes guts.
He is a boxer.
YYR in our chatroom is convinced he will.
He will pick it up.
He loves to be in front of the camera.
Media whore!
This isn't a word for you being bad.
Although I hope that wasn't Pierce Brosnan and Mamma Mia.
How dare they give Mamma Mia a Razzie nomination.
How dare they.
I realize Pierce Brosnan was pretty shitty in that movie.
Why isn't that nominated for Best Picture, Rob?
That's what I'm wondering.
Alright, anyhow.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura.
What should the kids be playing this week?
The game of the week is Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
Which is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, if kind of dumb.
Give it up a little bit, Rob.
That's just the intro music.
Okay, now the Alex Kidd games were their own little fun dinky platformers.
Alex Kidd in Shinobi World was an attempt that Sega wanted to do to actually parody their own titles.
You know how there was Parodius for Gradius and Kidd Dracula for the Castlevania series.
The game was originally going to be called, it was actually Shinobi Kidd.
and it was just going to be a parody.
You hear the music.
It's the music from...
Uh-huh, Shinobi.
You here?
Anyway.
So, um, it was gonna be, yeah, like, just a cute little parody of, um, Shinobi.
And, um, it ended up, uh, becoming an Alex Kidd game so that they could perpetuate series.
Keep in mind, this was before we had Sonic.
This is Sega Master System era, y'all.
And, um, but it was, uh, a little funny thing about it is that the first boss...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But yeah, it's just a cute little platformer.
You've got four stages in it.
Where you have the Kabuto stage, Raid of the Helicopters, the Jungle, and Battle with the Dark Ninja.
So it's a pretty fun little game.
I really always like playing this game.
You have to do, since this is an Alex Kidd game, you have to do those damn Janken fights.
I actually, Rob, I don't remember.
You want to know exactly how long it's been since I've played this game?
A while.
I have to think about it.
We'll say a while.
My freshman year of college...
I traded all of my Nintendo systems for all of my friend's Sega systems for a week.
Just so I could see what the big deal was.
That's when I developed my Sega love.
I had his power base converter and played the shit out of this game and Castle of Illusion.
Oh, the boss of this level looks kind of like the Opa-Opa, I get what you're saying.
Yeah.
Oh, funny.
Okay.
This is a big, fun, parody game.
And I love the music.
I just think it's great.
I really like- I really love a lot of the Sega Master System games.
I also love the American boxes for them, just because they're so shitty and generic.
They have, like, cute artwork, blah blah!
Grid background!
But yeah, this was an Alex Kidd game.
You know, I actually liked a lot of the other Alex Kidd games because there was the Alex Kidd Miracle World and High Tech World.
That was another one.
But this one is actually my favorite of the Alex Kidd games.
Alright, there you have it.
Your classic game of the week, Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
A parody-rific game of some of Sega's great franchises.
That is going to do it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.
We've got plenty more news to report on in Part B, so stick around, guys.
We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
And hey, those of you that use Twitter, keep an eye out during this break.
Show us your tweets.
We'll read some of your responses when we come back after this little break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 25th of 2009 with our 310th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
These numbers are getting so high, it's just obscene.
And yes, that's starting with one.
We've been doing this a little while.
Anyhow, show us your tweets.
We asked on Twitter during the break, what should Rob do now that he left World of Warcraft?
And during the break, you guys responded.
GS68 says, get Castle Crashers.
Actdeft says, update the podcast in time.
That or play more games on Xbox Live Arcade.
Janai702 says, Rob should spend his leftover WoW subscription money on a super huge sandwich with bacon.
Om nom nom nom.
That's actually a very good idea.
Harry AKA says he should check himself into rehab before he relapses.
MistyOLR says, I don't know, work on the OLR shirts so I can do some pimping during Heisen.
That's a good idea.
Zakupilot256 says Rob should seek addiction counseling to prevent a relapse.
BlueSwim says Rob should play Kick the Ferret with, of course, the ferret.
Just joking, DarkSakura.
I heart the ferret.
X-Link 777 says, start a new drug habit or tossing a few tacos at people that don't like ABBA.
I love it when we get last week's jokes incorporated into the show.
Oh, DarkSakura, I wish you were here for that story.
Some kid threw a taco at his mom over a video game.
And he got sent to jail.
The mom called the police.
The kid went to jail.
That's fucking stupid.
What a way to teach him a lesson, though.
Giovedea says, Doing anything is better than playing WoW.
DarkTetsuya says, Start the cult with DarkSakura.
DJ Tyrant says, Play Persona 3 and 4.
Had no idea Rob left because I'm playing WoW right now.
SchmittyDog says, Rob should either create an ABBA tribute band or work on his musical career.
Have you heard me sing?
Crozy says, He should make a WoW-themed level on LittleBigPlanet
and hope it doesn't get taken down by moderation there actually was a wow theme level on LittleBigPlanet and it was actually kind of funny Biohaze20, last one I'm going to read here says wait until something better is out who knows when who knows when
I can't believe they're titling it this, but...
TMNT Smash Up
Yes, that is clever.
Ubisoft, way to go.
Apparently, it's going to feature arenas that will change throughout the battles.
You might remember something similar to Power Stone 2.
Or even Smash Bros., I guess.
You'll see players defeating their opponents either by knocking them off the stage...
or by emptying their health meter entirely, which can be filled with pizza.
Wow, if this does not sound like a ripoff of Smash Bros.,
I'll still play it.
It's Turtles.
But it says apparently this is now targeted for the Wii.
It says there will be no motion controlled attacks.
The waggle isn't ruled out for other aspects or context sensitive moves and stuff.
It's described as dark and gritty as far as like the graphic style.
And I guess Turtles co-creator Peter Laird is penning the single story or single player story.
And
You know, currently, as far as the roster goes, Ninja Turtles and Splinter are confirmed.
Hmm.
Alright.
Whatever.
I don't know, it's neat.
I don't know, I'm a little apprehensive about these type of games.
It'll never be as good as it was right when the arcade game and the original NES game were out.
It's just not.
The NES game blew.
Yeah, okay, but at least it had a good soundtrack.
But the arcade game was the best.
The best home version of any Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is Turtles in Time.
End of story.
I'll give it to you.
It was perfect.
A new video game title.
It's called Metal God.
And this was discovered, a trademark that was filed on January 11th.
It covers computer games, video games, and game controllers for computer games.
Huh.
Guitar Hero ripoff?
Death Metal Hero
That is kind of cool, but it's not the same thing as actually playing GWAR.
True.
So GWAR or GTFO?
I hope you're listening.
Rob Halford.
Halo!
Halo!
Halo Wars Halo Wars Halo Wars Halo Wars
Is that Loki mode?
I have to tutorial sometimes.
Like Mirror's Edge because I can't remember what I'm supposed to be doing in that.
Mirror's Edge is hard.
We'll have the Mythic Map Pack.
And I don't know when the US version is to be out.
March 3rd.
March 3rd.
Okay.
I'm like a freaking encyclopedia of games.
I swear to God, I don't like... Hey, it makes you great on the show.
Yeah, it makes you good.
I also don't know if that beta date is for us or for the UK.
But it's definitely for the UK.
I just don't know if it applies to us as well.
I'm pretty sure it's a worldwide thing.
It's the 5th for us, yeah.
Yeah.
I'll check it out.
I own all the Halo games.
There better, better, better, better, better be a Red vs. Blue introduction or something in it with Sarge.
You want a reference somewhere in the game?
Yes.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Maybe a unit.
We'll see.
Thank you for watching!
Talking about video game inspired fan tributes, I don't remember if I mentioned this on the show.
I think I mentioned this before we went live, but something, believe it or not, I finally saw for the first time, ironically, the day I quit WoW, was The Guild.
I don't know if you've ever seen this.
It's this YouTube thing that kind of parodies the whole World of Warcraft.
I only saw the first little four-minute episode, but it's hilarious.
And I just want to tell you, people aren't that bad.
Actually, some people are that bad, but I was never that bad.
Didn't you see Dr. Horrible's
No, I did not see Doctor Horrible yet.
I was too busy playing WoW.
You need to watch it.
I'll check it out.
To go back to what I was talking about, about the TMNT fighter thing, I forgot when we mentioned this the first time.
It's actually being put together by some of the ex-Brawl team, which is probably why it's a little bit like Brawl, and Team Ninja.
Oh, interesting.
So if it's by Team Ninja, does that mean we're going to get April O'Neil with ginormous tits?
3 parts, Rob!
3!
I'll watch it eventually.
Mini Ninjas.
This is a game that's being put out by IO Interactive.
You may remember them of putting out such games as the Hitman franchise or I think they did maybe Kane and Lynch as well.
This has actually been rated by the ESRB.
It's E10+.
It's kind of a cute action game.
I also talked about it about a year ago from
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
well it's also better than um oh god what the hell is that crappy movie franchise not um three ninjas yeah it's better than three ninjas or pocket ninjas because that movie also sucked or little ninjas isn't that also a like a three ninjas type movie yes oh god i remember watching that it was so horrible like what was the like called like the guy like a
Don't make me go back to that place, Loki.
What was that, the Dollar Tree video thing?
Never buy a video for a dollar because you get what you pay for.
Well, here's something you can buy relatively cheap.
Crystal Defenders.
This is a game put out by Squeenix.
It's a mobile and iPod game.
It's about defending towers, basically.
It's actually going to be coming out for consoles, according to Fumitsu Magazine.
They're going to put it out on WiiWare.
It's called Crystal Defenders R1.

Just three.
Alrighty.
Hi, Orange Lounge Radio!
Hi!
I'm a latecomer to this podcast and I found out while browsing various podcasts on the Zune Marketplace.
Hey!
Well, thank you, Zune Marketplace, for the plug.
I'm glad I've stumbled onto it as it's a very entertaining podcast.
You shouldn't worry too much about it being horror, even though my most cowardly horror movie-loathing friends enjoy Left 4 Dead.
This is mainly because Left 4 Dead is less a survival horror game and first-person shooter as it is a party game.
I explained it to one of my friends best when I said Left 4 Dead is pretty much Rock Band with the Undead.
Listener, Ross.
P.S.
I decided to join your Steam community group, but are there only 19 people in it?
I know there's got to be more listeners than that.
Maybe a little encouragement from the show?
Join it!
I don't even remember where the Steam community is at.
I know it's going to sound horrible.
I don't even know if I'm in it.
I don't think I am.
So I'm going to have to look it up.
I didn't even know we had a Steam community.
I must admit, it must have come up like once in a show a long time ago, like when I first got Steam, and probably because I never used it, it lost Steam.
But I will check it out, and I want to get Left 4 Dead, and another game I've been eyeing getting on Steam is Mirror's Edge, because I kind of want to check that out.
And for some reason I'm feeling like playing it on the PC as opposed to a console.
So we'll see.
I will check out Left 4 Dead though and yeah go find the Orange Lounge Radio Steam community and I'll plug it next week on the show and then I'll play it and then I can play with listeners because I don't know a lot of people that play PC games so I'm sure there's there you go we'll see next email dun dun dun which actually I got two emails from the same person and one is a continuation so let's just go for it okay
To start with, my brother just won a PlayStation 3 at work.
Let me reiterate, my brother won a frequent PlayStation 3 at work.
An 80 gig model specifically.
He's gotten GT5 Prologue, is getting GTA 4, and my getting LittleBigPlanet are givens.
True dat.
True dat.
My Guitar Hero World Tour somehow got the cymbal wires cut slash torn.
Probably it's having a sensitivity issue, so I've gone ahead and replaced it with the Wii RB1 drum kit.
Soon we'll see third-party drum kits for all the systems as common as third-party guitar controllers.
Also, dude, you could actually solder the wires too and fix it.
Anyway, I have Saints Row 2 and the ported form of Orange Box on my Gamefly list.
I have to see what else to look into.
My brother is a subscriber of Netflix and will be changing most of his rental list to Blu-ray versions of the movies.
Is the PS3 Netflix streaming currently available?
Xbox 360.
Yeah, it's only on Xbox 360.
I don't think you can...
using your PC.
No, you can watch movies on your PC.
Well, I know that, but I'm not sure if you can use the Netflix on PC as a media server and then stream it to your... No, I think it uses its own application, so I don't think you can do that.
They do have an application out there that will actually stream whatever is on your PC monitor, so using that, then yes, you could probably stream Netflix, but you'd have to find that first.
So, there you go.
Any more emails?
I haven't even done, Rob.
Oh, sorry!
I didn't conclude this one, Rob.
And just for the heck of asking, will the TV tuner units for the PSP and DS, although generally not readily available in the United States, become obsolete with the digital transition?
What a good question.
Well, obviously not in Japan, because they're not switching over there.
I mean, that's only in the US.
So...
I would think yes, they're going to be obsolete.
If they're using the same type of technology, if they're not receiving digital TV signals, which I doubt they are, then it's not going to work.
The TV tuners for the DS and stuff over there work with their network.
It's not the same as ours over here.
You can't tune in our stations with that TV tuner, basically.
Hmm.
So, you wouldn't be able to use them anyways.
I guess it depends how it works.
If it's basically hooking up rabbit ears to your DS, then it's not going to work.
But if it's somehow feeding... Because I thought it was a digital streaming service over there.
Was it OneSeg or something like that?
I don't know.
But I know it's not compatible over here.
That's why they haven't brought it out over here because...
You can't use it on our network.
Not that I don't think that many people would be interested in streaming or watching live TV.
I guess it could be useful.
Well, to conclude the email, by the way, it was from Robert M., by the way, just saying.
The second portion that was sent says, As if my last email wasn't long enough, since I found them for $20, I went ahead and purchased the Orange Box, good choice, Burnout Paradise, as well as LittleBigPlanet.
Hopefully my brother can invest in a second controller.
I'm replacing Orange Box with Fallout 3.
He found LittleBigPlanet for $20?
That's a hell of a find.
I'd say so.
Good for you.
Unless he just means that he just purchased it.
Orange Box and Burnout Paradise would most likely be in the less expensive range.
That's it.
Those are some good choices, though.
It's over!
That's it?
For emails?
Yes.
What a weak selection.
No offense to the people that did email us, but we didn't get a lot of emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.
Mm-hmm.
Burnout Paradise
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Thanks for watching!
Browse while connected to the Criterion Games Network.
And you'll be able to see all the game updates and purchases and stuff like that.
Tweaked vehicle handling.
Earlier cars are now tweaked to be easier for newcomers to use.
And these cars are now slower, harder to crash, and less likely to spin out at low speeds.
Junkyard sorting.
You'll be able to compare the stats of the cars and you'll be able to filter out cars and bikes.
and upcoming download content vehicles.
Stunt run timer change.
They have a different timer now that starts much slower than before.
Allows beginners more wiggle room to start a combo.
And let's see here.
They've rebalanced the events.
All events have been modified to accommodate the new car speeds.
They have road rage tweaked a bit.
Players are no longer able to get additional time once they've reached the target score.
Let's see here.
Enhanced visuals.
They're going to be fixing some of the in-game billboards and smashes.
Stuff's easier to spot.
The lighting's been tweaked to make it more vibrant and easier to drive at night.
They have a new restart function, so if you fuck up during a race, you can restart it, which is nice, instead of having to just drive all the way back to the starting point.
And then, easier barrel rolls.
Barrel rolls are now
Automatic.
That's a lot of stuff.
Yeah.
And then, of course, the upcoming premium download content, the party toy cars and legendary cars, I think, are all coming out on the 6th.
That would be cool.
And new trophies, of course, tying in with that download content.
Awesome.
Awesome.
Alright, I love it, they have one that's Sound the Horn on the Silver Lake Super Jump in the Calvary Bootlegger Because that was the, you know, generally I know, I love how they have all their cute little new names for the vehicles I thought that was especially cute, how they get around the copyright there, or what have you
Well, speaking of download content, some very, very highly anticipated download content, probably by our very own Loki, is The Lost and the Damned.
That is the official name for the new downloadable expansion for Grand Theft Auto IV that is coming out on the Xbox 360 and only the Xbox 360.
The Lost and the Damned is coming out February 17th.
That's right, we finally have a release date, February 17th.
As far as how much it's going to set you back...
1,600 Microsoft Points.
That's 20 bucks.
Apparently, though, it will be about 10 to 20 hours of new gameplay, new missions, new music, new weapons, and apparently membership to a biker gang.
One thing apparently that's not in it, though, is the voice actor who originally did...
Nico's voice in Grand Theft Auto 4.
I remember reading a story about that as well this week.
Apparently, it just costs too damn much money for him to come back.
Well, he was saying that he wanted more money, or should have asked for more money, and he's not coming back because of that.
The other thing that kind of sucks, too, is that Lost and Damned download content is basically its own game.
So when you download that, you don't get new weapons in, say, the normal Grand Theft Auto game and stuff, because they say it just doesn't make sense that Nico would have access to...
you know, grenade launcher or something like that.
I say, fuck that.
Who gives a shit about continuity?
I mean, I want my damn tanks and stuff.
So, but, yeah, I will have to download this because it looks pretty awesome.
But it's not something that's going to be fluid with the original game.
It's like really a separate game.
Well, they're going to have a portion that kind of crosses over with Nico, but it's very brief.
I mean, he's in it for just a second during a cutscene.
Because you're going to have to copy-paste his voice acting from before if the guy's not coming back or get a guy to impersonate him.
Yeah, which is kind of lame.
I think they should just put out a pack later that's just...
over the top stuff like bring back the flamethrower.
They were going to have the flamethrower in this game and they cut it out.
It's lame.
Bring back the flamethrower, the minigun, the tanks.
Just go crazy with it.
And the Animal Crossing Village.
And they should bring zombies in there.
Have it where you defend Liberty City against a zombie attack or something.
Totally rip off 28 Days Later or something like that.
Alright.
We will see.
Porn!
No, Mega Man!
StarForce3, Red Joker, Black Ace
Which actually looks pretty cool.
I actually haven't played any of the Star Force games before.
But it's sort of an action RPG with what they call noise changes.
So you can actually use a hundred different noises to combine that changes Mega Man's look in the game and also changes his abilities.
It's based off of Earth, Wind, Air, and Fire.
Fire being the greatest of all time, of course.
and you can trade noises with other Nintendo Wi-Fi players.
So it's supposed to be out in the summer.
It looks sweet!
Yeah.
I don't know.
I want more side-scrolling Mega Man.
At least we got Mega Man 9.
That's hard to complain.
Why can't that be ported to DS is what I want to know.
There you go.
Just make Mega Man 10.
But make it easier for dum-dums like me.
No, keep it hard.
It gives you a sense of accomplishment.
Yeah.
Well...
There's a game that's coming out, or I should say it's not coming out.
It's a mature game by the name of Winter.
It was being put out by the team, Endspace.
Basically, they were behind the GameCube game Geist, which was kind of...
Not that successful.
Apparently they ran into a problem though with their sales and marketing groups.
Apparently the game, they could not get behind a Survivor horror title on the Wii.
And in spite of great sales like on the Resident Evil 4 and Umbrella Chronicles and stuff that's similar to this, they didn't get the green light to basically make this game.
Which is lame.
But the game itself...
Thanks for watching!
Now, you know, on the Wii.
That sucks.
You know, a somewhat serious looking survival horror game and they don't want to do it.
But yet they'll remake Resident Evil 4.
It's silly.
Seriously, with so much of a ripoff of Silent Hill, it's not even funny.
It was... You could have called it Silent Hill and people would have been like, Oh my god, Silent Hill!
You know, that close.
What about Silent Snow?
Is this game just going to slip into obscurity forever?
Do you think it's possible this game could show up?
It could come back.
You never know.
I mean, they're going to have, was it the Lost Mountain or something like that?
I think is one of the survival horror games coming out in the Wii.
And there's some other ones.
I mean, Sadness, whenever the hell that actually comes out.
Did Sadness end up getting canceled or something?
No, I don't think it's still being worked on.
That game looked pretty amazing and then just kind of disappeared.
Yeah.
It may come back later if they start doing more games that are like adult on the Wii and they end up being successful.
Because they can say, hey, you know, maybe we should put out this game.
Because if you look at some of the games like, for example, Two Human.
I mean, that thing was in development since like the Nintendo 64.
I mean, Cameo.
I mean, those weren't exactly great games.
But still, I mean, it could...
All right.
Dawn of War 2 Warhammer 40,000 Steam
And then suddenly it just disappeared.
GameStop.com is no longer offering the game.
If you call a GameStop store, they will tell you that Dawn of War 2, you can't pre-order this game.
But apparently, previously, you were able to get a Chapter Command War Gear set if you pre-ordered the game through GameStop.
So what the hell's going on?
The game didn't get cancelled.
In fact, they just mentioned that the game went gold.
THQ is behind the game, and they actually bumped up the release date.
So apparently though, something's going on with Steam.
The game is requiring you to install Steam, and of course Steam being the way that you can get games online.
Apparently GameStop Corporate not happy with this.
But the weird thing is, don't Valve games make you install Steam too?
Yeah, because it's Valve's program.
But yet they carry those games.
GameStop will carry Orange Box and those type of games.
Hmm.
Hmm.
GameStop is kind of pissed.
A lot of this is kind of rumor, but it would make sense because GameStop does not like it when digital distribution occurs before the game is released to retail.
This kind of goes back to when Penny Arcade Adventures came out.
I have to ask, why do they even care?
They don't really give a shit about PC titles.
If you've seen their PC selection, it's like a shelf.
Seriously, who gives a crap?
I don't know, maybe it's the principle of the thing.
It's like, oh, you're really cutting into our PC sales, which are very small anyways.
Who cares?
Anyway, take this news with a little bit of caution, because it's not necessarily... It could be some very strange misunderstanding, but a lot of people are reading into that the game is just not available.
I don't understand why they wouldn't carry game because I mean that's potential for people to trade in other things that they make a high margin off of you know to buy said game I mean hell they're doing it now I mean it's so ridiculous they're doing it now with download content cards oh I'm going to trade in some games to get a card to go download something off of Xbox Live Arcade I mean like or you know the Lost and Damned or the new Tomb Raider levels and stuff like that it's like
Really?
Why don't you just buy a card?
You know, a points card.
It's the same thing.
I don't know.
It's retarded.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm sure we will see an official corporate response from one of the two in the next week, so you can probably bet we'll hear something about this next week.
Well, how about some different type of news?
Thanks for watching!
You're so mature.
I know.
Anyway.
He's working on a 2D RPG.
What?
Yeah, he's working on a 2D RPG, but it's... I really don't know what else to say about it.
It's just, it looks like a 2D platformer type of RPG-ish sort of thing.
But he said that he...
wants to say that they're trying to do something specific with the actual way the game plays.
There's really not too many details on it, and I squeezed the fear out by accident.
And he actually doesn't really have that much attention that he's paying to it.
It's more like going, okay, I'm going to work on the RPG.
Ooh, shiny!
So in other words, he'll do whatever he damn well pleases, but this is what's capturing his attention right now.
Yeah.
RPG.
Well, okay.
At least he's not developing it for the DS and he's not going to lock himself into a room because he can't get a dev tip.
Hey, that guy apparently finally let himself out of the room.
Trashed his room.
That guy had issues.
Let's throw a fit now.
I don't even remember that guy's name, and even if I did, I wouldn't want to say it.
I totally forgot about the guy, except I sort of remember us talking about it.
Yeah, remember the guy, he locked himself in a room and was throwing a fit because Nintendo wouldn't send him a dev kit or whatever?
Oh, the retard.
Yes, he finally quit his little tantrum and trashed his entire room on his way out.
I know, I know.
But yet, here we are talking about him.
and lots of people did.
This game looked lame anyways.
He's like, I need a dev cam.
I'm like, no, I don't want to play that game.
That game looks stupid.
I don't care if you waste it.
Seriously, it looked like something you'd make with RPG Maker.
Like the old RPG Maker.
Not anything good.
Sorry.
I don't know.
Maybe put ZZT.
on the DS.
Yes, they do.
ZZT on the DS.
Yes, they do.
I say yes.
Alright, more news.
Alright, well, in the tradition of download content for EA games, Skate 2 has now put out some download... Well, I wouldn't even call it download content.
You download a key to unlock crap.
Basically, it's a... Time is money pack.
It costs you 400 Microsoft points, and it will unlock all locations, skaters, and gear that can be earned by playing through Skate 2's career and online modes.
So basically...
For people that don't want to play the game, they'll just unlock everything right there for you.
Which begs the question, why even buy the game if you don't want to play through it?
So it's pay-to-unlock content.
Yes.
Which I always hate in video games.
It's stupid.
Pay-to-unlock cheat codes, that's basically it.
They've done this before.
With other games, right?
Yep, Tiger Woods, other EA games.
News about pay-to-unlock content makes me angry.
And here, yeah, Aesthetic Vampire says it perfect in chat.
Chat.orange.com, he says it's for lazy asses.
Absolutely, it is for lazy asses.
So to anyone that's actually going to support this kind of content and encourage them to put out this content in the future, I'd like to dedicate a little piece of angst to you.
FUs of the week time, DarkSakura
My biggest FUs go to incessant bitching without the will to do anything about it.
And I'm not saying that that's what anybody in this room was doing.
I am saying that I have been hearing nothing but people bitching all week about stupid shit that they could just say something and it would be fixed.
Thanks for watching!
And I've been accused of being bitchy about it.
But you know what?
I really have... You know how much sympathy I have for the incessant complaining without doing shit about it?
Zero.
Mother Teresa, you ain't.
Well, Mother Teresa was a bitch.
Only on this program.
No.
Mother Teresa liked to make people suffer because it made them closer to God.
This is true.
That's why all of her little hospitals were nothing better than hubbles.
She wouldn't deliver medicine and would do nothing to ease the pain.
I didn't mean to open a can of worms during the FU.
Mother Teresa was a bitch.
What if you were suffering from starvation?
Wouldn't that make you closer to God because you're dying?
In her opinion, yes.
Also, Gandhi was a racist.
But, anyway.
Less controversy, more angst.
Well, that's true.
At any rate, it's just, you know, like, for example, I have a friend who says she's going to listen to the show and never does.
And you know who she is.
I'm not going to say on the air.
Who, at work, does nothing but complain about work.
about the same thing over and over again.
She complains about her family the same thing over and over and over again.
And it's the same crap that she does too.
And we're like, well, you know, all you have to do is this and you can fix it.
Same thing over and over and over and over again.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, nothing, you know, and also, and also, this goes in with it as well.
I also don't like for people to look for a crutch, you know what I mean?
To put all of their hopes in one place and expect that that is going to be the end all, oh my god!
and I would like to right now offer an apology to our president the very awesome and we have a handsome president too but I would like to apologize to President Obama on behalf of all the fucking morons who thinks he can fix all the shit that's wrong in the government
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I bought 10 cans of cat food, by the way.
to help these people who were fostering homeless cats at their own house in a no-kill shelter because they were trying to do some good in the world.
And because I believed in what they were doing, I contributed.
You know, it's cat food as an example.
But I'm just saying, you know, if you want something bad enough, make it happen.
It is a bummer, though, the economy didn't magically change overnight.
did really who expected it to?
if anyone expected it to, they're fucking stupid I know, hopefully soon alright, any more?
we gotta move on no, I'm sorry for ranting that's alright, Loki a few Rockstar games for making a crappy PC port of Grand Theft Auto 4 just reiterate that until I fix it and a few to the Spring TV lineup for having too many damn shows on that I need to watch that happen to be on at the same time I can't do that
And you can't keep putting out cool shows, because then I get distracted.
That's not good.
I can't watch American Idol, Lie to Me, Nip Tuck, House, possibly Heroes, although it's supposed to suck this season, but I still gotta see how bad it's gonna suck.
Fringe, and some stupid dance competition show.
So you think you can dance?
No, it's that International Dance Stars or something like that.
It's got the Grooves on it, so I wanted to watch it.
Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
Is that it?
That's it.
My F.U.
goes to the headache I have setting in.
Boo hoo.
I'm going to have to go run in the house and take some ibuprofen.
Otherwise, I don't have a lot of F.U.s.
I'm in just like a mood.
F.U.
to being blow.
That's what I feel like.
I feel a blow.
There you go.
Alright, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week.
More angst next week.
Blow.
Blow.
and DarkSakura.
I don't want to get on that tangent.
I will talk instead about this.
We were mentioning, or the chat room, I should say, was mentioning, when DarkSakura was talking about Obama, somebody had made the comment about he's the first president that did his addresses on YouTube.
TigerClaw said that in the chat room.
Obama is the first president to post YouTube videos of his addresses.
So very interesting how YouTube has come a long way.
They're also on the Xbox Marketplace, too.
All the different...
All the inauguration stuff.
MSNBC.
Also, this is something I was watching on CNN.
I think it's cool.
I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this coming out of the White House, too.
He said that he wanted to be much more transparent and available for the public.
He said the president is a public servant.
That's true, right?
I think we're going to be seeing a whole lot more.
There's actually a Spider-Man comic with Obama in it, too.
But then didn't he not let cameras in when he retook the oath?
I don't think that was him Just in case he fucked up again No, he didn't fuck up
The guy repeating it... I know what I... He said it right.
The dude repeating it to him fucked up.
It was just one of those awkward... Fired!
I don't want to get too political.
I just thought he just smiled and was like, did you screw up?
I don't want to get too political, but the whole fact that they had to do it a second time was ridiculous anyway, because there's an amendment in the Constitution that says Obama was president, whether he said, I like cupcakes up there on the stand or not.
Which I do approve of that message.
That should be the new inauguration.
I like cupcakes.
I'm saying my point was look for more of this.
I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this massive internet interaction with our government coming up.
So I think that's pretty cool.
Well, speaking of massive interaction, there's a whole version of Street Fighter that you can play on YouTube.
I believe it's some type of tie-in.
Yes, on YouTube.
I believe it's some type of tie-in with Soda Toys or whatever because they keep featuring this.
But it's interesting, and I'll play it here in the background here.
It's like this whole little Street Fighter thing.
And as you play it, you can click on a button while it's flashing to make a move.
It uses like the branching YouTube technology or whatever.
And so I can select my fighter.
So let's pick Zangief because he's the gay one.
So I clicked on him.
And it took me to Zangief versus Guile.
And now all the buttons are flashing, I can do stuff!
So, like, I clicked Y. And it took me to another video where I got punched in the face by Guile, but I'll click A now and try to hit him again.
And I get to hit him in another video.
Where I got kicked in the face again!
I am not very good at YouTube.
Because you have to hit it when it flashes.
I hit it when it flashed.
No, you stopped.
See?
Oh.
You have to hit it right when it flashes.
Go.
Oh wait, I'm Guile.
I'm playing against Sangief, huh?
So I guess that's a good thing.
Woohoo.
Anyway, so it's like this whole little interactive Street Fighter game.
The user's name, if you want to see this, Patrick B-O-I-V-I-N.
Unfortunately, there's no real easy way to link a YouTube.
But that's it.
Interactive Street Fighter on YouTube.
Kind of interesting.
You know, there's something, though, that I actually am curious about.
Did you ever play Mugen?
That was the fighting creature on Fighter, right?
That was a long time ago when the chat was talking about there should be an all games interactive versus Orange Lounge Radio like fighting game and they were going to do it in Mugen except nothing ever happened.
Well, I actually, I've kind of got an idea for doing an Orange Lounge inspired Mugen.
There'll be more to come from this.
I would like to speak to people who are familiar with doing custom characters for Mugen and sprite editors.
That's all.
But how about some different stuff?
Jason's yelling at me in chat saying, what the fuck?
There's no easy way to link to YouTube.
Link the first video.
Now, I can do that for you guys in chat, but remember, it's a radio show.
I can't exactly sit here and go, okay, go to YouTube.com, uppercase L, uppercase P, you know.
I can't exactly read that little garbage code there.
Anyway, sorry.
That's what tiny URL is for.
I guess.
Even tiny URLs kind of pokey.
Anyway.
You know what one of my favorite games was though, Rob?
What is that?
When it came out a few years ago.
What's that?
Hydro Thunder!
Dude, that game is still at a lot of arcades.
It's like one of the only actual arcade games you see in arcades.
I freaking love that game.
And I played the crap out of it on Dreamcast.
Hell yeah.
Well, guess what?
There's going to be a spiritual successor to Hydro Thunder called H2 Overdrive.
I know.
But I'm looking at pictures and it looks like totally like how Hydro Thunder looks.
It basically is Hydro Thunder.
They remade some of the levels from the original game.
So why didn't they just call it Hydro Thunder 2?
Because someone owns a trademark for that.
Oh, lame.
This is supposed to be out, I think, by Raw Thrills.
So they actually should be seeing it at the ATEI Expo in London to, you know,
If any of our listeners in London are going to be there, do take pictures, please.
But yeah, it's official.
In fact, 1UP has a preview of it with the video and everything.
So, check it out.
Coming to an arcade near you, maybe?
I will sew there.
We'll see.
Sounds awesome.
It's going to be in the corner of all the Pete's Places now.
So there was some games talked about during Ubisoft's financial earnings conference call.
Assassin's Creed 2 A new Ghost Recon game
Of course, Beyond Good and Evil 2, because that's already been announced.
And also, they let another title slip that they weren't supposed to talk about, but Red Steel 2 is going to be coming out at some point.
Now with Wii Motion Plus.
How did that slip in there?
Oh, by the way, Red Steel 2.
No, he's like... I forget what it was.
It was...
We have lots of products coming for the Wii next fiscal year.
We have Red Steel... Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that.
GS68 in chat calls it Red Shit Teal 2.
Red Steel was very disappointing.
This isn't a surprise, though.
I've heard them talk about Red Steel 2 before.
They have to fix a lot of stuff if they're going to do that.
But you know what, though?
Conduit looks awesome.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Maybe they can do it.
Alright, well, when I was telling you my Warcraft story earlier about how I, you know, left and everything, I assured you I did not do it to go back to Final Fantasy XI.
And after some news this week, Lord knows if I could, I might have been banned.
Because apparently tons of the hardcore players were banned from Final Fantasy XI this week.
Although, just joking, obviously I would not have exploited a cheat in the game as these people did that got banned.
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
and Squeenix finally did some emergency maintenance on November 26th.
That was a while ago.
They went back, I guess, for all those logs and all that stuff and figured out who did this.
They temporarily suspended 400 players and 550 players who committed serious misconduct.
We ban you!
You can never play again.
So there it is.
Apparently a lot of these banned players were long-time Final Fantasy XI players.
So who knows?
Maybe they did you a favor.
No, but that's got to really suck to put a lot of time into a game like that and then suddenly wake up banned one day.
and I get told in chat by my buddy Miklatov says, you couldn't if you wanted to, Rob.
You never made it to Endgame.
That's true.
I never did make it to Endgame.
I played how many years of Final Fantasy XI and I never got to Endgame?
Nine months of WoW and I was in Endgame.
And it sounds like if I played on Jamie's pirate server, I could probably get to Endgame content in Ragnarok in about an hour.
No, no, no.
Sounds like 20 minutes.
No, not even that, actually.
It's like you can get to level 150, no problem, after rebirth, but it does take longer to level to 255.
But that's interesting, though.
I mean, man, you could say, hey, they cheated, they deserved it, but that's very interesting that they let this exploit go on for so long and then they retroactively did that.
You know what?
If they're not hacking the game, if it's just like a bug in the game that did that, I don't think they should punish them at all.
I mean, to be honest, if it's your poor programming that's caused this duplication glitch, I think you should fix it and that's the end of it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and this guild found this way to exploit the boss fight by I don't know you drag him to some type of lava or something and basically if you just let it go on and on and on for five hours you can win this fight so it's more of an endurance thing but you have to do it for five hours so they exploited it got the title for doing it because you get a title if you do it bragged about it on the official WoW forums and found themselves with a temporary ban
All the people that were involved and got a rollback on the clock because of it.
That's kind of lame.
I remember when I was playing on IRO, if there were item duplication and things to happen like that, they'd do rollbacks.
Yeah.
Or, because you can't really, doing an inventory wipe of just one character would be kind of... Crappy.
Alright, anyway.
Well, that's going to do it for our stories tonight.
We will get to last-minute stories very soon, but we do want to open it up to you guys and let you guys have a say and give us a call.
If you want to give us a call, our Skype line is open.
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll-free in the United States and Canada.
Or you can give us a call on our Skype.
It's Orange Lounge Radio is the name on Skype.
And we have opened up the Skype line, and we're waiting for your calls.
And so while we wait for the buffer from our live chatty to get to the people listening so they know it's open, do we have a quick last minute story, Loki?
Yeah, remember that patent that they had for a directional sensing DS card?
Well, apparently it's being used for some stargazing app that's coming to Japan.
That could be kind of interesting, actually.
Well, the app's actually pretty expensive.
It's 8,190 yen.
Oh my gosh, it costs a lot for that kind of motion sensing technology.
It charts over 9,300 stars, planets, suns, and moons.
Strange.
Hey, we got a call on the Skype line.
Let's go to it.
Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
This is that guy that you can probably guess who it already is.
In case there's people listening for the first time, you should probably introduce yourself.
Hi guys, I'm Jason.
Hi Jason.
Jason, our fearless webmaster.
We're getting a new website soon, right?
We are.
I'm so freaking excited.
Have you talked to Deke?
We're going to have to come up with a title for him too because Jason is the webmaster, but Deke wrote the site.
So now we're going to have to think of a title for Deke too.
I don't know.
I was kind of trying to mull that over in my head and I hadn't come up with anything yet.
We'll think about it.
But definitely, credit is very important in all of this.
Yes, very, very important.
And we have to think of a way to thank him publicly.
So we'll think of something.
Anyhow, Jason, what did you call about tonight?
I don't know if you guys talked about this in your gaming weeks.
I didn't see it in the show role.
People aren't supposed to know that you can see what we talk about before the show.
I have secrets.
Alright, what's up?
Special privileges.
So, Konami Digital Entertainment released a certain demo.
I don't remember if it was last week or this.
is it sparking any uh have you guys already talked about this last week yeah during my gaming week last week i mentioned i'm assuming you're talking about dance dance revolution light s or whatever it's called was this seriously last week yes actually here's the thing konami put out the press release this week but the game's actually been on the store for like 10 days
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You see a little placeholder for United States and I think, I'm assuming Britain, but there's nothing there.
You can't press them.
You can only go to the Japanese site, which I can't understand.
So I thought when I saw the press release... There you go.
He's actually going into it right now.
My thought was that you would go to the website now that they put the press release out and you could actually look at the website now.
But no, that's not up either.
So I don't know why they waited until now to put out the press release, but they did.
I'm just that behind.
I only saw this... I just kind of stumbled across it during the week.
Did you know there's also a Silent Hill game on the store?
I think I saw it and I just didn't get it because I went to see... I went to their company little section of the iTunes store and I wanted to see what else they put up.
It's...
It's not even... They slapped Silent Hill sprites on a 3D maze game.
It's not even anything.
Although the music's kind of cool, so I guess there's that.
Yeah, and Touch Konami still has not changed.
Japan is deep black, and United States and Europe are gray, and you can't do it.
That's right, can't do it.
Well, what did you think of the demo?
So what did you think of the demo?
I already talked about it last week, and now you know to go back and listen.
But what did you think of the demo?
It sure is hell more impressive than any other mobile version of the game that's come out yet.
The Xbox version had a better frame rate than the iPhone 1 does for me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Perfect Attack, those songs on real DDR.
I can't even get a full combo yet on the phone version.
Yeah, I haven't managed to combo it either.
It's tough.
But it's a demo.
It's free.
It's hard to knock it.
DDR fans will eat it up.
Depending on how expensive it is, I'm considering getting it when they actually release it.
That is what they're trying to sell their finalized product on, so we'll see.
and it's it is technically impressive for what it is there's a character in the background I haven't actually sat down and really started memorizing it to see if it's random or not but there's a nice series of visualizations uh everything in the game looks damn near the the way it should be the way it has been a character in the background the music quality is beautiful uh
it's impressive and I just have to see how much they're going to charge for it when it actually comes out you have to remember despite all my bitching about song list and everything I mean frame rate and everything you have to remember it's a freaking cell phone game and not bad for a cell phone for a cell phone game alright anyhow and like I said especially compared to all of their other mobile releases thus far which is also a very hard comparison but it's still very valid true any other thoughts Jason before we let you go
My arms hurt a whole lot.
Sorry to hear it.
I hate reading furniture.
I was going to make a masturbation joke, but I guess since you've actually moved, you have a legitimate excuse, and I'll let you go just this once without making a joke at your expense.
Alright, bye Jason.
Night.
You want to give us a call?
1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Loki, another story to tide us over?
Yeah, sure.
Let's see.
Well, there's another WiiWare title that we forgot to talk about, Pulse Big Adventure, which is coming from Sega.
It is a parody of a bunch of 8-bit games.
It takes place, I guess, it's developed by the Phantasy Star Universe producer, and there are 100 hidden gags in the game, including, for example, if you eat a mushroom, your character will grow beyond the size of the screen.
Very ironic, considering DarkSakura was just a minute ago talking about, you know, in part A, I should say, about an hour ago, talking about a 8-bit parody Sega game.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no.
I mean, she was talking about, like, Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
That's not what I'm making reference to.
It's just funny that all these years... And Mario.
Yeah.
Also, I'm watching a little big plan at Super Mario Sack Brothers level.
I've played that level.
It's interesting.
Anyway, the phone lit up again.
I want to go to it.
Hi, caller.
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is Spazinator.
Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?
I just want to double check and make sure I heard you right.
Did you just say earlier in the show that you gave up WoW?
Run that by me again.
Did you say that you gave up WoW?
Yes, earlier in the show on Part A, I'm taking a long, extended, long, long break from WoW.
DarkSakura, I may want to check to see if you're like breaking a fever or anything like that.
You know, that doesn't seem to really...
You know, make a whole lot of sense, you know, simply because I know you are a big fan of WoW and DarkSakura is a big fan of Ragnarok, you know, you guys give real folks games and it seems a lot of place, you know?
I'm a huge fan of WoW, but I was a bigger fan of the people that play WoW and the people that I interacted with in my guild, but it's not like I'm dead.
And many of those people I already knew before I played WoW and I will continue to know.
But WoW was just getting to the point where it was like a second job and...
I just need to take a break.
I'm not knocking the game.
Blizzard has put a phenomenal game out there that people give a lot of unnecessary shit to.
For the show, this is going to be great because I've got a million video games to catch up on.
It's going to be great.
For what it's worth, I know you kind of touched on it a little while ago, but if you're looking for another MMO, personally, I can recommend Final Fantasy XI.
It
You know, at least on the two servers that I'm on, which are Odin and Alexander, there's a lot of really great people on there.
We're constantly doing stuff, whether it be stuff for the new expansion, Wings of the Goddess.
I gotta say this, Spazinator.
Loki and I actually played Final Fantasy XI for like three years.
for an ungodly long time.
I hear a lot has changed in the time I was away while I was gone in WoW and a lot of it sounds really interesting but it's just kind of a place I'm not really interested in going back to.
But again, not knocking the game.
There's a lot of great things about Final Fantasy XI.
I hope you guys have a blast.
But I think for me right now, I don't want to quit an MMO to just go play another MMO.
At least until the Star Trek MMO comes out.
Yeah, true.
Well, thanks for taking my call.
I don't want to take up too much more of your time.
I mentioned there's probably a lot of people trying to call in, so...
Thanks for the call, Spazinator.
Have a good one.
A comment from RicePrincess who's listening right now.
Of course you love RicePrincess.
She was here last week.
If Rob's going to play an MMO again, it's going to be Hello Kitty Online.
Very tempting, Hello Kitty Online.
Very tempting to at least look.
There's Hello Kitty Online.
Yeah, I believe it's free.
I think it's free.
I might have to do this.
You know what?
Other one looked interesting.
1877 GameOLR, Orange Lounge Radio.
What, DarkSakura?
I like Hello Kitty.
Me too.
Loki?
I was going to say they keep advertising that free... What is it?
Fusion... I think Fusion Fall or something like that.
The Cartoon Network game.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.
You know, again, I have such a huge backlog of, like, Xbox and PlayStation 3 games I need to play.
I don't want to look for another MMO right now.
The only exception I might make is something like, actually, something like Phantasy Star Online actually sounds like a lot of fun because, you know, as DarkSakura said, you can play it forever or you can play it for, like, five minutes, pretty much.
You know, just do one little area.
That sounds more tempting than anything else I've heard so far.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Yellow, Dammit
What was I going to say?
Well, I've played a few more PC games.
Plus, I haven't quit WoW.
And speaking of WoW, I haven't quit WoW either.
But this month I can't play because I'm too poor to actually pay for it.
Other than that, what was I going to say?
Fear 2.
The demo was released.
Yes, somebody sent me a Twitter message telling me I had, I don't know if it was you, somebody on Twitter, I think it was Twitter, sent me a message, Twitter or Facebook, sent me a message saying you need to check out Fear 2, it's the best demo I've played in a long time.
I did queue it up on my PlayStation 3 to check out, so I will definitely see that for next week, but I'm assuming you've already played it.
Yeah, I played it, of course I played it on a PC, and
Ooh, it, it, well, it has, the most funny thing, the thing is that, well, the last five minutes of the demo is really kicking ass.
I'm not even sure if I'm going to spoil it, but, well, you get to pilot this mecha thingy.
You get to pilot a mech thingy?
Yeah, you get to pilot some sort of robot, whatever... Strange.
Huh.
Now, is it actually... Especially since, if I remember right, the developers of Fear 2, Monolith, has, like, ain't there, like, they released an old game of theirs called, what is it, uh...
Shogun, Mobile, Assault, whatever, yada yada, something.
Which was a hybrid of a bit of everything.
Since in that game you could pilot big robots, and they are quite big fans of piloting robots.
Here's my question about Fear 2.
Was it scary?
Yes, it was.
Even though, well, if you're gonna play it on PS3, I don't even know, but I will say this, apparently it requires the almost hefty computer to play.
Even though I can say that, well, I've played it on my old, one of the first generation Core Duo 2, and it rolled just fine.
but then again I didn't crank it up until like massive so hmm and what more?
oh yeah, Dawn of War 2 has been the multiplayer beta for that has started oh and how's that going?
that's going just fine it's really like well it's sort of
and so on.
Hear our story earlier about the brick-and-mortar store GameStop, huge here in the U.S.
I don't know if you have them over there.
Refusing, well, rumor, refusing to sell this game in their stores because of the digital distribution.
Do you think that would hurt this game?
Well, here's the other thing, is that, well, I don't even...
It might do.
But here's the other thing.
First of all, I got into the beta due to the following fact that I did bought Soulstorm on Steam.
And since THQ does have most of their games on Steam, or at least a few of them, that was due to that.
Tabula Rasa has entered its free play state of something.
That would be a good one, because at least I know the plug's going to get pulled on Tabula Rasa before too long, so I can't get that sucked into it.
Good suggestion.
All right, Ake, we've got to let you go, buddy.
But have a good one.
All the way from Sweden, my friends.
Ake Ripper giving us a call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
We love hearing from the international listeners.
It's always a good time.
Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR in the U.S.
and Canada or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
Do we have another last-minute story, Loki?
Yes.
I am very excited about this news.
Mario Kart with custom levels Oh yeah, that'll be awesome Good times, good times Let's go to the call of phones Take one more call before we're out of here for tonight Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio, who's this?
Legend of Zaku Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
Nothing much, just spending another lazy Sunday at home Me too But I do this internet radio show thing on Sunday nights, I don't know if you've heard
But yeah, I guess basically it's been going off with Microsoft and everything.
Pretty much you reap what you sow in terms of delivering products which basically call for people to get laid off.
Oh, are we talking about the whole Windows Vista being blamed for the recent Microsoft layoffs?
I guess, well, either that or they're just trying to like, you know, trying to outsource the rest of the jobs.
But besides the point, it just sucks to see that, you know, the folks at Flight Simulator, the folks who created Flight Simulator are pretty much getting canned.
I mean, they didn't have anything to do.
That's a damn good tool for pilots.
That's a game I remember from when I was a kid.
Not only is it a game, but it's like a resource for people who are really big into flying.
True, true.
It's hard to call that a game.
It really is a simulator.
But it can be considered a game in that sense.
I mean, you do it.
To each his own, whoever enjoys flying around for several hours in a virtual plane.
No, I'm not into hip-hop, unfortunately.
I mean, there are certain songs in 2DX, for example, you know, certain other songs that are, like, you know, faster to scratch on, like, ah, damn, I wish I could name them off the top of my head, but, yeah, I mean, it's each his own, I guess, as long as it allows a person to actually, you know, literally scratch on the DJ, I mean, on the turntable.
And if the controller for it is actually any good, if it's just like Kraken DJ with only two turntables and maybe a crossfader, it could be a lot more realistic than 2DX.
Besides that, download that Fear 2 demo.
I don't care for what system you have, PS3, 360, or PC, get that shit.
Yes, sir.
Just get it now.
Yes, sir.
Get it fucking now.
I'll do it, because Zaku told me to.
All right, Zaku, you have a good one.
Yep.
Have a good one, Zaku.
Yep.
He's awesome.
Several OLR listeners I've met in person.
In fact, I am trying to get back to New York City this year, just a heads up, folks.
I don't know when, but it's one of my goals.
If I told you why I'm really going to New York City, though, you'd laugh at me.
But I do have a friend that lives out there, as you all know, and I'm trying to get back out there this year.
Want to hear something awesome?
What's that, Louie?
Well, we're thinking of, because I remember I have that company vacation that I can take, that $1,500 one.
Yeah.
So we were going to go to Seattle, but...
It's kind of boring if you just go there for Seattle.
I love Seattle!
Yeah, whatever, okay.
Okay, so we're thinking going to Disneyland instead.
But now, since Conan O'Brien's taking over for Jay Leno, he films in L.A.
Uh-huh, that's true, that's true.
When's he starting?
In the summer?
Soon, I think.
I mean, they're already saying he's filming in L.A.
You're going to spend your $1,500 vacation on L.A.?
I mean, no offense, but you can drive to L.A.
on the weekend, for God's sake.
Well, Nelly hasn't been there yet.
You should go to the East Coast.
New York City is a wonderful place to go.
Yeah, but the thing is, they only cover $1,500.
I mean, that's the flight right there.
We don't want to spend it.
No, you can get a JetBlue flight out of Sacramento for $250.
Disneyland!
and Disneyland is pretty fabulous.
We would go to Disneyland and maybe Universal Studios.
I do want to see Conan though since my dream to go to Price is Right with Bob Barker hosting is long past.
You should still go to Price is Right.
I would love to see Loki and the wife on a game show.
That's what I want to see.
You guys need to go on one of those low-budget game shows like Lingo.
I don't have the game show appeal.
I'm not like some crazy redneck or like, you know... Dude, you do a radio show on the internet about video games.
That's a pretty awesome niche.
And no one gives a shit.
No one gives a shit.
You tell them that, they're like... Yeah.
You're not in the military, are you?
No?
Sorry, you go back to the audience portion of the...
I don't know.
They would never call me on one of those shows.
It'd be awesome, but no, they would never do that.
Never, ever, ever.
It's just like I've given up on getting the Employee of the Month thing at my work because that'll never, ever happen.
I love this.
D5T1, I don't know if there's an easier way to pronounce that in chat.
D5T1 suggests Supermarket Sweep.
Hey, dude, Supermarket Sweep is awesome.
Is that still on TV?
I don't know if they make new episodes.
I think it's on PAX or something.
I think...
Surely, is that guy still hosting shows?
He could be.
They could still be doing it.
Supermarket Sweep's awesome.
I'd go to the supermarket.
Dude, Loki would like load that cart up with those turkeys.
Be awesome.
I think all of us want to go on Supermarket Sweep.
Who doesn't want to go on Supermarket Sweep?
Hold on, I'm actually, thanks to the powers of Wikipedia, I'm looking it up right now.
Uh, no, it looks like it went off the air in 2003.
They probably still run it in repeats, but that's that.
2003 is when it stopped.
And I don't hate New York, it's just it's so damn expensive to travel there.
It's not... New York was my first pick.
And it was just, you know, it wouldn't work out as far as, like, you know...
We don't want to spend our own money.
And the problem is that $1,500 can only be used on the hotel and on travel.
And I don't think we can do... It's all weird because it has to be booked through Expedia and stuff like that.
I don't know.
It's lame.
I'm going to find you a fun $1,500 trip that's better than L.A.
I'm going to make it my mission for $1,500.
Well, there's only certain cities I can go to.
All right.
All right.
We'll see.
We'll see.
I actually am going on vacation again.
I wanted to make sure that I said something about it.
Not really a vacation, it's more like a family visit.
Going to Washington.
To Prosser, Washington.
Wait, does that mean you're going to be gone next week?
Yes.
Oh, what a bummer.
Yes.
Alright.
I doubt I'll have internet or anything.
Well, gosh, DarkSakura.
I'm going to visit Dan's family.
No offense, Ranma, I'm not going to go crash with you if I travel to New York City with my wife.
No, that's not going to happen.
Him and the wife want to have lots of sex while they're on vacation.
They're not going to do it in your spare bedroom.
No, if we're going to go on vacation, we're going to go on vacation in a nice hotel and stuff like that.
We're not going to just go crash at someone's house.
That's something like if I was going to an anime convention or something in New York City.
Plus, Nelly would freak.
Yeah, if it were just me.
You don't know the wife.
If it were just me traveling to New York City for something, then yeah, that would be probably fine.
But, you know, not with the wife.
No, that doesn't work that way.
Alright, anyhow.
We gotta wrap up the show and get the hell out of here.
Get everybody's final thoughts.
DarkSakura, welcome back and see you next in two weeks, I guess.
What a bummer, because next week we have the... Bobby's not on the air, so we got a lot of time to kill next week, so we'll see what happens.
But enjoy the trip to Prosser.
We're driving.
It's a pretty drive, though.
17 fucking hours!
Make the best of it.
Take pictures.
Bring it back.
Get to be with your hubby.
Any final thoughts on the show before we go?
I want some ice cream.
Ice cream does sound delicious.
Very delicious.
My final thought is the only thing better than ice cream is that ice cream that was made out of Samoas.
And I don't care what they call them now.
The Caramel Delight sort of the crap Samoas.
Loki, what's your final thought?
Final thought is I need to find a song for Cagematch.
I know which song I want, but it's in my car.
Dude, I think you won the last time we did a Cagematch.
Well, I also like the song by Uncle called Burn My Shadow.
It's in the new teaser trailer for Fuel, which is going to be the next kick-ass racing game I'm really into.
Basically, from the creators of Dirt and Grid, they're doing a racing game basically that's in an alternate...
Future where weather has changed the face of earth and basically you're like racing through tornadoes and shit.
So that sounds awesome.
And then they actually have a video of racing through tornadoes.
So I'm down with that.
Oh, this is kind of a bummer.
Final thought from YYR in our chatroom.
Of course, he's the man who made Snake360.
We had him on the show a few weeks ago.
As of right now, the Snake360 contests are now over.
F you to the major gaming sites for not covering them because not enough people entered.
I can't even give away all the prizes.
Bummer.
Sorry to hear it.
We'll take your prizes.
But no, in all seriousness, as I was telling somebody, I gave somebody advice earlier in the week.
You've got to remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, so sometimes it takes a long time.
We did OLR for many, many years with only like a dozen people listening before we finally broke it and got two dozen people listening, and that's about where we're at now.
No, but again, and I say this at the end of every show, remember, it's the community that helps make Orange Lounge Radio, and without you guys, life would suck a lot, and we would not be as motivated to do the program.
So thank you guys, as always, for tuning into this program and spending your Sunday nights with us.
Please, if you like the show, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.
Help us spread the word because, again, we don't have any major... We don't get covered by the major gaming sites either unless they're accusing Loki of breaking an NDA or something.
We don't get any coverage from major gaming sites either.
So we only get word of mouth.
That's really it.
So leave us a nice review on iTunes or any other podcast site.
Help spread the word for Orange Lounge Radio.
But until next time, myself, DarkSakura in two weeks, and Loki next week.
We'll be back.
