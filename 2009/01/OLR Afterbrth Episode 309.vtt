WEBVTT

00:00.659 --> 00:01.120
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

00:01.520 --> 00:04.584
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to do much of an afterbirth tonight because the show went on so long.

00:04.684 --> 00:09.730
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having stream problems, and I think I have a cage match pick from Jamie, but I'm not sure.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.694
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to say screw it and kind of move quickly tonight.

00:12.734 --> 00:19.182
[SPEAKER_00]: But Victoria did walk back in studio, so I wanted to give her a chance to say any last things she wants to say to the listeners.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.267
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun being on the show.

00:22.668 --> 00:29.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's been trying to get me to come on the show for a while.

00:32.274 --> 00:33.254
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

00:33.354 --> 00:36.176
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really tuned in to listen.

00:36.917 --> 00:38.518
[SPEAKER_00]: How nerdy is this, seriously?

00:38.558 --> 00:39.238
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

00:39.298 --> 00:40.479
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a nerd factor.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.540
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got deeper into the nerd forest, my friend.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.902
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we'll have a camera next time?

00:45.502 --> 00:46.883
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we should have a camera next show.

00:47.323 --> 00:49.045
[SPEAKER_00]: We got sent one from one of our listeners.

00:49.105 --> 00:49.685
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, thank you.

00:50.806 --> 00:53.207
[SPEAKER_00]: AkumaJP, I believe, was the one that sent it.

00:53.648 --> 00:55.409
[SPEAKER_00]: And DarkSakura has it, though.

00:55.449 --> 00:56.489
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to bring it with her next week.

00:56.510 --> 01:01.713
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping... I mean, they're going to leave us... Like I said, I'm checking out the game Scratch this week.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.495
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're leaving us a... It's...

01:05.228 --> 01:07.608
[SPEAKER_01]: A presentation deck.

01:08.089 --> 01:12.029
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the DJ deck, but I think it's missing all the internals out of it.

01:13.249 --> 01:14.850
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they wouldn't give me the actual deck.

01:14.910 --> 01:17.730
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be kind of generous of them.

01:20.251 --> 01:23.611
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm able to bring that in, but I may if I can.

01:24.351 --> 01:24.871
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be sweet.

01:24.891 --> 01:25.632
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't care.

01:29.232 --> 01:29.712
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

01:30.052 --> 01:32.193
[SPEAKER_06]: I did kind of get a headache from all the nerdiness.

01:32.253 --> 01:32.753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:32.773 --> 01:33.773
[SPEAKER_06]: You suck.

01:34.542 --> 01:35.543
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I love you.

01:36.103 --> 01:37.004
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is fun.

01:37.344 --> 01:39.245
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I got to hang out with Irene and Matt some more.

01:40.806 --> 01:41.527
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

01:41.947 --> 01:43.789
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for letting me be on your show.

01:43.889 --> 01:44.829
[SPEAKER_06]: Muchas gracias.

01:45.129 --> 01:45.530
[SPEAKER_00]: De nada.

01:45.930 --> 01:46.250
[SPEAKER_06]: All that.

01:46.430 --> 01:46.931
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this.

01:47.031 --> 01:48.772
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't believe we've done this almost seven years now.

01:48.932 --> 01:49.833
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no life, my friend.

01:49.853 --> 01:51.434
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first night we ever did this.

01:51.454 --> 01:52.435
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how many people listened?

01:52.555 --> 01:52.875
[SPEAKER_00]: How many?

01:53.055 --> 01:53.455
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve.

01:53.776 --> 01:54.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

01:54.696 --> 01:55.317
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve people.

01:55.737 --> 01:56.578
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's not.

01:56.618 --> 01:57.158
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably have.

02:06.707 --> 02:08.208
[SPEAKER_00]: about 70 that listen live now.

02:08.228 --> 02:09.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's more than 12.

02:09.228 --> 02:12.329
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I mean now thanks to the podcast we have hundreds.

02:12.509 --> 02:14.830
[SPEAKER_00]: Or two weeks ago we would have done it tonight.

02:14.870 --> 02:15.390
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I be Brett?

02:16.010 --> 02:19.732
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be anybody you want, but two weeks ago we did Video Game Match Game and you missed it.

02:20.232 --> 02:22.032
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to really know anything about video games though.

02:22.052 --> 02:22.993
[SPEAKER_00]: People say random shit.

02:23.293 --> 02:23.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fun.

02:24.013 --> 02:24.973
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you love Match Game.

02:25.073 --> 02:26.334
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love Match Game.

02:26.574 --> 02:29.615
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob and I are going to be Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly for Halloween.

02:29.715 --> 02:31.175
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's your Halloween costume this year.

02:31.476 --> 02:31.876
[SPEAKER_00]: Be awesome.

02:32.856 --> 02:34.397
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so there's no cage match tonight.

02:34.417 --> 02:35.218
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to say.

02:35.438 --> 02:36.139
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta wrap up.

02:36.179 --> 02:37.440
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's already almost 10 o'clock.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.400
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on air four hours.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.701
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is gonna be huge this week.

02:39.741 --> 02:40.642
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over three hours.

02:40.682 --> 02:43.024
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've had one clock past three hours in a long time.

02:43.524 --> 02:44.465
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a fun time.

02:44.785 --> 02:45.646
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys very much.

02:45.966 --> 02:46.667
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, guys.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.188
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a fortune cookie message of the day for you all.

02:49.829 --> 02:50.369
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.291
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it say go fuck yourself?

02:52.571 --> 02:52.731
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

02:52.951 --> 02:54.673
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the fortune cookie message of the day.

03:21.477 --> 03:21.877
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

03:21.997 --> 03:23.738
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it for my fortune key message of the day.

03:24.918 --> 03:26.179
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Syphil and Ollie show.

03:26.219 --> 03:26.699
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.

03:27.279 --> 03:27.919
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it.

03:27.939 --> 03:28.859
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say Romy and Michelle?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.280
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted me to do the Romy and Michelle?

03:31.770 --> 03:36.533
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we'll do two fortune cookie messages today just because I love you that much.

03:36.553 --> 03:37.534
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love this.

03:37.554 --> 03:38.194
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you that much.

03:38.474 --> 03:42.137
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I posted this in my live journal and I said... You were watching Romeo and Michelle yesterday.

03:42.217 --> 03:45.919
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I said, I don't know why, but this clip just seems to sum up my life.

03:46.399 --> 03:46.960
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.

03:54.685 --> 03:54.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

03:54.885 --> 03:54.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

03:56.431 --> 03:57.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, um, great suit.

03:58.353 --> 03:59.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an Armani?

03:59.434 --> 04:00.635
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes it is.

04:01.235 --> 04:01.956
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought so.

04:02.796 --> 04:03.637
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do?

04:04.238 --> 04:05.619
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a suit salesman.

04:07.521 --> 04:08.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you excuse me?

04:09.222 --> 04:12.165
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood.

04:16.769 --> 04:17.109
[SPEAKER_00]: Be funny.

04:17.169 --> 04:17.370
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

04:17.390 --> 04:21.354
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually watch it because of the limp she has as she walks away.

04:21.494 --> 04:22.735
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crappy.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.138
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody.

04:25.678 --> 04:26.119
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.

04:26.519 --> 04:27.140
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pulling the plug.

04:27.420 --> 04:27.780
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

04:28.161 --> 04:28.521
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye, guys.

04:28.541 --> 04:29.042
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of here.

04:29.422 --> 04:30.703
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see you next week.

04:30.763 --> 04:32.145
[SPEAKER_00]: Same bat time, same bat channel.

04:32.265 --> 04:32.946
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie will be back.

04:33.326 --> 04:33.967
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.329
[SPEAKER_00]: Another friend of mine wants to come on the show.

04:36.850 --> 04:37.330
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.

04:37.350 --> 04:37.590
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt.

04:38.891 --> 04:39.231
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

04:39.371 --> 04:41.093
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that was here for New Year's.

04:42.335 --> 04:44.117
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to come talk about PC games.

04:44.898 --> 04:45.579
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have that.

04:45.960 --> 04:46.901
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.

04:48.182 --> 04:49.284
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be cool.

04:49.324 --> 04:49.644
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

04:49.865 --> 04:50.225
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done.

04:50.265 --> 04:50.786
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of here.

04:50.806 --> 04:52.007
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next week.

04:52.188 --> 04:52.448
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

05:36.119 --> 05:37.821
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

06:13.496 --> 06:19.566
[SPEAKER_06]: All Games Radio is currently switching between our station and our live feed, which may take several moments.

06:20.047 --> 06:20.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Please stay tuned.
