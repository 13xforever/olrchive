WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
All right

00:01.000 --> 00:05.740
And we're not gonna do much of an after-birth tonight because the show went on so long or having stream problems

00:05.740 --> 00:09.000
And and I don't I think I have a cage match pick from Jamie

00:09.000 --> 00:12.620
But I'm not sure so we're just gonna say screw it and kind of move quickly tonight

00:12.620 --> 00:14.620
But Victoria did walk back in studio

00:14.800 --> 00:19.120
So I wanted to give her a chance to say any last things she wants to say to the listeners

00:19.600 --> 00:21.160
It was fun

00:21.160 --> 00:23.160
Being on the show I Rob's been

00:23.160 --> 00:29.840
Trying to get me to come on the show for a you know be on the show for a while and

00:31.560 --> 00:35.840
Yeah, it was just it was fun. I've never really never really tuned in to listen

00:36.440 --> 00:42.440
How nerdy is this seriously it is like your nerd factor? You just got deeper into the nerd forest my friend

00:42.440 --> 00:43.920
Do you think we'll have a?

00:43.920 --> 00:50.040
Camera next yes, we should have a camera next show we got sent one from one of our listeners. Thank you. Thank you one law

00:50.040 --> 00:53.320
and Akuma JP I believe was one to send it and

00:54.080 --> 00:58.680
Dark Sakura has it though. She's gonna bring it with her next week. I'm hoping I mean they're gonna leave us

00:59.000 --> 01:03.160
like I said, I'm checking out of the game scratch this week, and they're leaving us a

01:03.880 --> 01:05.780
it's a

01:05.780 --> 01:07.000
presentation

01:07.000 --> 01:12.020
Deck it's basically the DJ deck, but I think it's missing all the internals out of it

01:12.160 --> 01:15.560
So you know cuz they wouldn't give me the actual deck that would be kind of

01:15.560 --> 01:23.440
a generous of them no, but yeah, so I don't know if I'm able to bring that in but it may if I can

01:23.960 --> 01:25.960
I'll be sweet. They don't care

01:26.120 --> 01:32.600
All right, so yeah, it's just been it was fun. I did kind of get a headache from all the nerdiness. I'm sorry

01:34.120 --> 01:39.200
But you know I love you, and this is fun. I've you know I got to hang out with Irene and Matt some more

01:39.200 --> 01:46.160

We would have done it tonight you can be anybody you want, but two weeks ago

02:17.800 --> 02:21.720
We did video game match game, and you missed it. You don't have to really know anything about video game

02:21.720 --> 02:24.920
