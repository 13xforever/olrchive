0	7000	Forged Lounge Radio
7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loco!
14000	19000	Tonight, January 25th, 2009, GameTap removes some of its free games,
19000	27000	Dawn of War 2 disappears from GameStop, and did we both finally win a movie award?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	We do tape live on Sunday nights every week at AllGames.com,
47000	53000	and it's all brought to you by myself, Rob Roberts, and my wonderful co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53000	55000	Worship me!
55000	60000	Back after a week of absence. What were you doing in your week of absence?
60000	62000	Writing the charter for my cult.
62000	66000	Wonderful. Yes, this is a conversation carried over from Bobby's show,
66000	68000	which can be heard before us Sunday nights live.
68000	70000	Official drink is Propel.
70000	74000	And DarkSakura apparently is going to be fixing the economy by starting a cult,
74000	76000	and somehow this is going to fix the economy.
76000	78000	My plan is brilliant.
78000	82000	Because the companies aren't making enough money because the consumers aren't buying
82000	85000	because they don't have money because they've been losing the equity in their home
85000	87000	and going into foreclosure and blah, blah, blah.
87000	89000	So I'll tell you what.
89000	91000	Give me all your money.
91000	97000	I will go and pump money back into the economy on my wild spending spree.
97000	104000	Help the banks by getting the biggest mortgage ever, which I will be paying off with your money, of course.
104000	108000	And personally revitalizing our bank and credit system.
108000	111000	And what about everybody else who's broke because they gave you money? What are they going to do?
111000	116000	Well, when the economy's better high, they'll get new money.
116000	121000	And jobs. They'll be jobs to accommodate my shopping spree.
121000	123000	You know, whenever I think about cults...
123000	125000	And there's more.
125000	129000	With the stuff I decide not to keep any longer, after my wild shopping spree,
129000	135000	I put it back on eBay, and all these people who now have jobs to accommodate my needs
135000	139000	can buy the stuff off of eBay. It's brilliant.
139000	141000	And I replenish my money.
141000	144000	Every time I think about cults, because we are a video game show.
144000	146000	I know you didn't mention a single video game in your cult,
146000	150000	but maybe that's what you'll spend money on is pinball machines or something.
150000	153000	But I think of the cult in Earthbound. Do you remember that?
153000	157000	God, I can't remember the name of them, but they wore the little purple things.
157000	160000	They all looked like eggplants or whatever, and they spoke in the funny language.
160000	162000	Does anybody remember what I'm talking about?
162000	165000	I know the chat room must at chat.orangelandsradio.com.
165000	167000	Somebody will name it for me.
167000	171000	Earthbound. You went to Happy Happy Cult. Wasn't that their name? Happy Happy Village or something?
171000	174000	I think that was it. It was the Happy Happy Cult.
174000	176000	Loki, are you a member of the Happy Happy Cult?
176000	178000	No, I'm not playing Earthbound.
178000	180000	Earthbound's a great game.
180000	182000	I'm sure it is.
182000	185000	What have you been up to this week, Loki?
185000	190000	Still trying to get Grand Theft Auto 4 to work on my PC.
190000	192000	Oh, that's right. You were quite a difficult piece of that.
192000	197000	Basically, what it comes down to now is I'm going to have to actually reinstall Windows 4 to work.
197000	201000	That's quality developing right there. Quality.
201000	207000	When a game requires you to reinstall your operating system for it to work correctly.
207000	209000	Good job. Kudos, Rockstar.
209000	212000	Have you thought about calling customer support or anything just to see me?
212000	219000	I post on GTA forums and they have Rockstar Toronto is actually there helping people.
219000	220000	Are other people-
220000	221000	Not me, though.
221000	223000	Are other people having the problems you're having?
223000	226000	Yes, some people are having the same problems I'm having. No one's helping them either.
226000	228000	And people are also having other problems.
228000	231000	There's a new patch that came out that caused even more problems. So awesome.
231000	234000	What are you talking about? There's no problem.
234000	235000	Sweep under the rug.
235000	237000	Yeah, it's less than 1%.
237000	244000	See, they pulled the old Microsoft bit where it's less than 1% of our customers are having problems with Grand Theft Auto 4.
244000	246000	It's just they have to be the most vocal of the bunch.
246000	249000	How does it feel to be less than 1%, Loki?
249000	251000	I- I'm special.
251000	253000	I have three words for you.
253000	255000	Better Business Bureau.
255000	257000	I have more words for you.
257000	261000	I'm pirating their next game and I'm not buying their shit anymore.
261000	263000	I- See, listen, I was originally-
263000	265000	How is that gonna hurt them?
265000	270000	It's not. It's gonna save me spending 60 bucks on a game that will work for a month and then stop working.
270000	274000	That's magically as if, you know, for no reason whatsoever.
274000	275000	They don't care.
275000	277000	That's money that could potentially go into your cult.
277000	278000	Hey, listen, now-
278000	285000	But, the first rule of my cult is stab in the face anyone who wrongs you.
285000	286000	I'm just saying that-
286000	288000	Figuratively or literally, please.
288000	291000	Okay, now I'm just saying originally I had pirated this game, okay?
291000	295000	I was gonna do that, but you know what, I'm like, it's a quality game, they deserve my money.
295000	305000	So I went out and purchased a retail copy of this game and so I could, you know, install mods, you know, play online if I really wanted to, but I wasn't really interested in that.
305000	310000	I just really wanted to, you know, I felt that this deserved my money.
310000	313000	Goes to show you what happens when I pay for stuff.
313000	314000	Remember the last game that I paid for?
314000	315000	Spore.
315000	317000	Oh yeah, that sucked.
317000	320000	It sucked really hard because it's crap.
320000	322000	Because they're like, it's so awesome, you gotta buy it.
322000	324000	And then you buy it and you're like, ha, it's crap.
324000	325000	Ha ha, we tricked you.
325000	329000	So if it's so much crap, why are you not really gonna do anything about it then?
329000	331000	Cause there's nothing I can do.
331000	332000	There's plenty you can do.
332000	335000	Okay, I can call their customer service and they go, oh, I don't know what's wrong.
335000	339000	Oh, you can, you know, send a letter in to the CEO.
339000	342000	You can write the Better Business Bureau and file a complaint.
342000	346000	Or he can get on his podcast and tell hundreds of people of the, or I guess.
346000	347000	I'm just saying, okay.
347000	348000	I'm overestimating our list.
348000	350000	He can tell dozens of people.
350000	354000	This is the problem I have is that people, I'm just gonna say it for the FUs.
354000	364000	I'm just saying though, I mean, I've been more than, more than, I've been more than generous to them, I should say.
364000	369000	Cause, I mean, you know, at our work we have, you know, a LAN set up and everything.
369000	374000	And I've purchased copies of Grand Theft Auto IV on 360 for each one of those systems.
374000	377000	That's five different systems that have that game.
377000	380000	I think overall I purchased about six copies of that game.
380000	382000	I mean, I'd say that's more than generous.
382000	390000	And the fact that I was even, you know, generous enough to go beyond that and purchase the PC version of the game.
390000	392000	The least they could do is help me out with my problem.
392000	393000	They don't seem to give a shit.
393000	395000	So you know what? I don't give a shit either.
395000	398000	And the next game that they put out, that's Grand Theft Auto, that happens to be on PC.
398000	401000	You better believe I'm not gonna pay for it.
401000	403000	Now when it comes on 360, yes I will.
403000	405000	Because I'm just like that.
405000	407000	I gotta buy it for the 360 cause it's awesome.
407000	413000	And yes, and sadly enough, I'll probably be buying the download content that'll be coming out for Grand Theft Auto IV.
413000	416000	And I may even buy the download content for each one of those systems.
416000	418000	That's $100 right there.
418000	421000	But you know what? I don't know.
421000	428000	I think unless they come out, cause basically what it is now, it's oh well something in your system is causing it not to work.
428000	432000	Really? Thanks for narrowing it down to something in my computer causing it not to work.
432000	436000	I was worried that it might have been the birds outside.
436000	439000	You don't want to see me on the phone with customers.
439000	445000	It's basically, you know, they told me, you know, people on the forums said, okay, uninstall all this stuff and reinstall it.
445000	449000	So I did all that. I did everything that could possibly affect this game.
449000	452000	Unstalled it, reinstalled it, all my codecs, everything.
452000	456000	Literally, I'm gonna have to reinstall Windows in order to get it to work.
456000	461000	Which is fine cause, you know, I don't really care.
461000	468000	But it's annoying. I even went and reinstalled and reinstalled Service Pack 3 just to see if maybe that would fix it.
468000	470000	But of course not.
470000	474000	Oh, and it doesn't help either. That takes 40 minutes to install Grand Theft Auto.
474000	480000	Whew, alright. Well, hey, our chat room at chat.orangelandrater.com is making a request.
480000	483000	Of course, we always like to have the chat room involved during our show tonight.
483000	488000	A request that if Loki does decide to call customer service, please, please record it and play it on a future episode.
488000	491000	But here's my thing. Here's my thing. I don't want to go too far into this.
491000	498000	But, I mean, is calling customer service, I mean, a lot of those reps, no disrespect, they do a very thankless job, you know, but...
498000	499000	I did customer service.
499000	503000	Right, and I teach for it. But, you know, they're kind of given a script. They're given limits.
503000	511000	They can't change a lot at their level. If he really wants something to happen, he's gonna have to get attention of people upstairs.
511000	517000	I'm going through the right routes. I'm going through GTA forms and they have the developers on there actually reading people's comments.
517000	531000	So they're supposedly looking into things. They're supposed to also be, you know, PMing people to get, you know, their system specs and the DX dialog, you know, output and that kind of stuff to see what exactly is causing problems.
531000	537000	Because I'm not the only one that's having these issues and this last patch was supposed to fix it, but it hasn't.
537000	548000	It made it load a little bit further, you know, I got past three different character screens and then it flashed the fourth one and then stopped working instead of just, you know, freezing on the third one.
548000	555000	But I don't get why I don't change anything in my system. It works for a month and then all of a sudden it stops. Period.
555000	562000	Just stops working and no matter how many times I uninstall it, reinstall it, do whatever, it does not work. That doesn't make any sense.
562000	565000	Dark Soccer is dying to make a comment and then we gotta move on to gaming weeks.
565000	570000	It's actually about customer service. Rob, have you done customer service yourself?
570000	572000	Yeah, it's the industry I work in.
572000	574000	But have you answered the calls?
574000	577000	Yes, of course. I have to to be able to teach him.
577000	592000	Well, not necessarily my work, but I did customer service and I can actually say that script is like only good for the first month of the job and after that a good rep is gonna know their shit, know who to go to, and know how to solve your problem.
592000	603000	No, no, no. Don't get me wrong. I mean, especially, you know, at the place I work, we've got great reps. You know, I just say that a lot of times, unfortunately, their hands are a little tied in what they can and can't do.
603000	609000	There's certain processes, procedures, rules in place. There's only so much they can do and they'll go, they'll do whatever it takes for the people on the line.
609000	620000	But, you know, again, I don't work in the video game industry either and neither do you and I think our industries give us a lot more leeway in those types of freedoms than a video game company. You know what I mean?
620000	630000	It's a little easier for you to investigate a loan or my people to get claims paid that need to be or whatever than to fix a game. You know what I mean?
630000	637000	I don't know if that makes sense, but, so, I don't know. I just think in their world it's a lot more limiting.
637000	644000	A, if you work in that world and care to disagree with us, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
644000	649000	Yeah, I would actually like to know how video game customer support goes.
649000	653000	I'd actually like to hear more about that too. So, something
653000	666000	I still think that there's way too many parallels from one to the other and I've talked to people who've done tech support that there's ways to get the help and ways to get the official answer.
666000	674000	Alright, let's move on. We've got to talk about our gaming weeks and usually we start off, each of us talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week.
674000	683000	But, I want to deviate a little bit tonight. I'm actually going to let Loki start tonight because he checked out a game that I think a lot of our long-time listeners are going to be interested in because it's a music-based game.
683000	694000	He kind of got a sneak preview at this. I have not heard a lot about this game outside of this show, but, I don't know, Loki, does it look to be something I should be keeping an eye on?
694000	704000	Yes, definitely. It's a brand new game. A lot of people may be familiar with DJ Hero, which is supposedly coming out from Activision later this year.
704000	714000	There was another music game that's also turntable-based that's going to be coming out from a company called Genius Products and they don't really put out a lot of games.
714000	731000	They just started getting into game distribution. They're mainly a movie publisher, but now getting into game publishing, they did the Line Rider game, I believe, and the Halo Interactive board game.
731000	737000	But, they are getting beyond that to a music game called Scratch the Ultimate DJ.
737000	746000	Now, what this game is, what makes it kind of unique, is the game relies a lot on actual turntable techniques.
746000	756000	What's kind of cool, they showed us a video of it because, unfortunately, the original plan was they were going to bring a demo or something for us to try out.
756000	760000	Unfortunately, the game is too early in development that they couldn't do that.
760000	767000	They actually had footage that they showed me that I can't share with you guys, unfortunately, because it's also very, very, very early.
767000	775000	They'll have stuff later on that they'll be rolling out in either February or March detailing the game.
775000	780000	They've got a really good marketing plan behind it, so there's going to be a lot of footage on this all of a sudden.
780000	785000	What's kind of cool, though, the game itself plays a little bit like Beatmania.
785000	796000	It's got the different bars coming down the screen that you've seen in most music games, and there's a side of the screen that shows the turntable section.
796000	798000	They're highlighted and stuff.
798000	804000	What is kind of unique about it, though, is the controller itself, which is made by Newmark.
804000	811000	I mean, it's actually made by Newmark. It's not a licensed product from Newmark. It's literally created by Newmark.
811000	816000	It's actually a turntable that looks like a Newmark turntable.
816000	829000	Then you've got five keys next to it, kind of like a Beatmania arcade-style controller, except they're all in a line, kind of like the Guitar Hero fret buttons, but a lot bigger and kind of nicer looking.
829000	832000	Next to that is actually a crossfader.
832000	846000	So during those sections that you can scratch in, you can actually do real turntable techniques with it, and the game will pick up on that and award you points and award you saying,
846000	849000	okay, you did this, this, and this, you know, type of techniques.
849000	858000	What's also cool about the game is you will not get penalized for hitting keys when there's not keys in the game.
858000	865000	They actually encourage you to kind of remix or, you know, freestyle a little bit, which is kind of cool.
865000	874000	So, yeah, right now it's set to come out in June. It's going to be about $100 retail, and PlayStation 3 and 360.
874000	878000	It looks pretty awesome. It's pretty much everything that you would expect from Beatmania.
878000	889000	You know, the controllers, ambidextrous. They're going to have like 60 songs. It's licensed hip-hop and R&B, which may not be for everybody, you know,
889000	895000	and that kind of turned me off of it at first, until I actually saw it being played, and it's pretty cool.
895000	903000	Some of the tracks that I think they have confirmed for it so far, like Flashing Lights by Kanye West.
903000	914000	Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Peter Piper by Run DMC, Hot in Here by Nelly, Milkshake by Killas.
914000	918000	Awesome. Awesome. Instant Sale.
918000	926000	Friends by Houdini, Party Like a Rockstar by Shop Boys, and Don't Sweat the Technique by Aaron B. and Ray Kim.
926000	933000	So basically, you're talking about a game. It looks like Beatmania, you know, and a question coming from our chat is, you know,
933000	940000	GS68 is making the Konami Will Sue joke. Do you think it's going to be something that's too close to comfort for Konami?
940000	949000	Their controller is different enough. I don't know if they consume because of the controller, since it's not just the way it functions is a little bit different.
949000	959000	Also, the interface itself is different than Beatmania. The way the screen looks, it's almost like a candy cane, I guess,
959000	965000	because kind of towards the left side of the screen, you'll see like a turntable spinning, and the notes come off the turntable,
965000	970000	and they kind of turn around, and then they come down like Beatmania would.
970000	976000	But, I mean, it's similar in the way it's played, but I don't know. I mean, I'm sure they'll try to sue them anyways, but...
976000	983000	Part of the way you describe it, though, makes me think that like Beatmania and Kraken DJ spawned.
983000	987000	Yeah, with the whole crossfader and everything, it does kind of sound like it's like a mix of them.
987000	992000	And the scratching, it's like a love baby of the two. But no techno.
992000	996000	You know, we have a lot of people in our chat who are in that Beatmania mindset thinking like,
996000	1001000	oh, if this game's going to have like a Beatmania-style controller, you know, I see Acidic Vampire says, I want techno.
1001000	1008000	But that's the thing. Techno does not have scratching in it, usually. That's why they basically stuck to hip-hop.
1008000	1010000	Could do, though, good drum and bass.
1010000	1020000	They could, and I don't see why they can't. I mean, it's just that they're really focusing on music that's going to be scratchable,
1020000	1027000	that you would hear scratching in. Another cool thing about it is they're going to have a microphone port on it
1027000	1034000	that you'll actually be able to sample yourself or whatever and mix it into the actual songs.
1034000	1039000	A wiggity-wiggity-whack. I could see myself yelling that in the microphone over and over.
1039000	1048000	And some other cool stuff they were saying that they're going to have, you know, some sort of way to play back your performances or something,
1048000	1050000	which is kind of cool.
1050000	1055000	You know what's funny? Does anybody remember way back, I know you guys will, but, you know, kind of asking the listeners,
1055000	1060000	does anybody remember way back, like when Beatmania first came out in the US?
1060000	1066000	I'm not talking about the game they put on the PlayStation 2. I mean when they actually put the five key machines in arcades.
1066000	1069000	Does anybody remember what they called Beatmania when they put the five key machines in arcades?
1069000	1070000	Hip-hop mania.
1070000	1074000	That's right. And was it hip-hop mania? Not at all.
1074000	1081000	But what's funny, the game he's describing sounds like it could be called hip-hop mania, which is kind of funny.
1081000	1084000	Things have a way of coming full circle like that.
1084000	1088000	Hey, there were those of us who were still playing BM98 back in those days.
1088000	1092000	Anyway, there's a lot of non-music game people that are like, what the hell are these people talking about?
1092000	1098000	It looks cool. They're going to have a lot of tie-ins with, you know, like the G-unit clothing and stuff like that.
1098000	1103000	It's just, it's very, I don't know, it looks good. I'd say definitely give it a shot.
1103000	1107000	There's going to be a lot more stuff coming out about it as it gets closer.
1107000	1111000	They're going to be really marketing this pretty heavily, and I think it's going to be a really awesome game.
1111000	1116000	Because when you consider, now because I kept asking them about like DJ Hero and stuff like that.
1116000	1125000	The difference between them and DJ Hero is DJ Hero is going to be more, basically the aim of the game is to mix two songs together.
1125000	1132000	Whereas this is actually about scratching. So, I don't know, it looks pretty cool though so far.
1132000	1138000	Let me ask the chat room about this though. I'm going to ask a question to chat and we'll read some of your responses in a minute.
1138000	1143000	Because I know we have a lot of people that have been listening to us for a long time, so we have a lot of music game fans in chat.
1143000	1151000	Does this game interest you even though the music may not be the type of music you're used to in these types of games?
1151000	1155000	Because I don't think we've had like a real, I should say one that can be taken very seriously.
1155000	1159000	I mean we've had the what, Move It To The Streets or whatever that game was called.
1159000	1163000	The Dance Battle or whatever. And we had that one random Xbox Live Arcade game.
1163000	1171000	I'm talking about, you know, this sounds like it's going to be pretty, chat room are you interested in this game even though it's going to be hip hop and not techno?
1171000	1178000	Chat room. And I ask the same question to Jamie. Is this of interest to you?
1178000	1181000	Not really. I probably won't play it. I mean I'll probably check it out.
1181000	1197000	But I actually really didn't like Kraken DJ. And I really have no interest in any of that music. Except for like, you know, the exception of the two pretty classic ones mentioned.
1197000	1211000	You know, Run DMC and Rakim. But I really have no interest in that music at all. I really have no interest in the hip hop lifestyle really.
1211000	1216000	I don't care for it. I don't really have an interest in the game.
1216000	1226000	That's my big sticking point too is that, you know, it's like I have an appreciation for some of that, you know, like you say, like the classics and some of those and even the silly dance songs like Milkshake and stuff.
1226000	1228000	It used to be cool.
1228000	1238000	Yeah. But I don't know. I kind of worry. A hundred dollars is a lot to ask. But I'll probably give it the benefit of the doubt. I'm definitely interested in checking it out. I really want to check it out.
1238000	1245000	Because, you know, if the interface works well and it's put together well, that's when I think we need to lobby these people to do the techno one we want. I don't know.
1245000	1257000	Well, I mean, and they're going to have not all of the music is going to be licensed. I think some of it they're actually making. So very well, I don't see why they couldn't do like house music or something like that that would have, you know, scratching in it.
1257000	1270000	I mean, it's just I know that there can be some techno songs they could have scratching it, but you would normally not hear a techno artist if you went to a club scratching out stuff with it. It just wouldn't make any sense.
1270000	1271000	Sure.
1271000	1285000	You know, and song lists are so critically important in music games, too. You know, why didn't any of us buy Karaoke Revolution Country Edition? Because none of us really rabidly listen to country. You know, it's always going to be a big selling point for music games.
1285000	1288000	It makes it very interesting when you're kind of like a music game fan.
1288000	1302000	I mean, we're literally like five months away from this. So, I mean, there's going to be a lot coming out about it. You'll be able to form your opinions based on what you see at that point. I mean, but right now, I mean, it's so very early. So but it looks good so far.
1302000	1303000	The name of the game one more time, Loki?
1303000	1305000	Scratch the Ultimate DJ.
1305000	1317000	All right. Let me read some comments from chat and then we'll get into our gaming weeks with Dark Soccer in just a moment. Again, I asked the chat room, are you interested in this game? Does this game sound interesting to you, even though it's not the typical type of music you've seen in other music games that have come out here?
1317000	1332000	YYR says, yes, it does. Act Def says, it does. But what's turning me off is the price. Let's see. Buchi Kawa says, personally, I play beat big games for the music, but I have a broad interest when it comes to music. I'll play it.
1332000	1341000	YYR says, I would like spending the music that we could actually hear in a club. Tiger class is probably not because I don't listen to hip hop.
1341000	1348000	Biohaze says, I would only be interested if you could load music from your hard drive and play it from that. Otherwise, not interested. Frisbee says, simply, no, not interested.
1348000	1354000	Dark Tetsuya said, yeah, if they had like an in-store demo or something, I'd at least try it once.
1354000	1365000	Liu Shen says, not really. Songs kill it for me, to be honest. Acidic Vampire says, I agree with Dark Tetsuya. I'd have to try it out first before I can judge it, but I'm not really into hip hop, but it could be fun.
1365000	1372000	Misty says, I'd probably get it eventually when I can eBay it for like half price. Milkshake is an in-joke bonus for me. There you go.
1372000	1377000	Two words would actually swing it a little bit for me. Beastie Boys.
1377000	1380000	How about 911 is a joke?
1380000	1382000	That's some old school public enemy.
1382000	1402000	Well, I mean, there's going to be like 40 some songs and that's only like six of them. I mean, like I said, it's five months away. And we don't even know anything about like DJ Hero. I mean, that game could be completely lame. Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be much different other than exchanging out a turntable for, you know, the guitar controller.
1402000	1412000	We'll be very interested to see what develops. We definitely have an eye on this game. Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about games we've had our eyes on this week, or in Dark Soccer's case, the past two weeks. How was your gaming week?
1412000	1425000	Actually, it was pretty bare because I started school this week. I pretty much just played some Fable and a little Ragnarok and that was it. I just really have not had a whole lot of time to play much of anything else.
1425000	1428000	School does that, doesn't it?
1428000	1436000	Oh, I played some Katamari on my phone, but I kept getting interrupted. So I haven't gotten past the first stage. Oh, and lots of solitaire.
1436000	1439000	Awesome. Loki.
1439000	1440000	And I finished a book.
1440000	1441000	What's that?
1441000	1442000	V, the second generation.
1442000	1443000	How was that?
1443000	1445000	That was freaking amazing.
1445000	1446000	You've talked a lot about V.
1446000	1447000	Book review.
1447000	1462000	Okay, quick. For those that don't know what V is. V, it was a series that came on in the early 80s about these visitors from outer space who came trying to be, you know, on the surface they were friendly. It turned out they were trying to steal all of our water and eat everybody.
1462000	1474000	And they were really lizard people underneath. And you can actually read the DVDs, but the creator of the first series did not like how they continued the series when they did the TV series in V, The Final Battle.
1474000	1482000	So he actually wrote a book about what the world would be like 20 years after what he envisioned going on happened.
1482000	1492000	And it's, it's like watching, it reads like watching the episodes. It's very, very visual and, you know, in far as how it's been in the description.
1492000	1497000	And it's just a fantastic book. So if anyone's a fan of V, get the book, just get it, get it, get it.
1497000	1502000	And yes, Robert Englund was in V. He was in there as Willy and that character is in the book.
1502000	1506000	That was a question from our chat room, acidic vampire. Very, very nice.
1506000	1510000	Who knew that you were going to get a book review listening to Orange Librator tonight?
1510000	1514000	I'm fucking literal, okay? I love reading. Books are fun.
1514000	1516000	All right. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1516000	1518000	Books are fundamental.
1518000	1523000	Books are fun to burn. Just kidding. How was your gaming week, Loki, outside of...
1523000	1530000	Not very, not very well. It's just, uh, Grand Theft Auto IV. That's basically it. Just played it at work and really went...
1530000	1531000	But not on your PC.
1531000	1533000	Yeah, most definitely not on my PC.
1533000	1541000	Yeah, that's basically it. Unfortunately, I wanted to play some other things. I keep trying to go back to Fable 2.
1541000	1547000	And I really need to finish, and there's no way I'm going to finish it in time,
1547000	1555000	Lost Odyssey because, god damn it, if Star Ocean is not coming out in like a month from now,
1555000	1559000	I'm not going to ever finish Lost Odyssey.
1559000	1561000	All right. I didn't know you were a big Star Ocean fan.
1561000	1567000	I'm not a big Star Ocean fan, but it looks awesome, so I've not played any of the Star Ocean games.
1567000	1570000	The first one was okay. I didn't finish it.
1570000	1573000	I guess I'm the only one that actually played quite a few games this week.
1573000	1578000	Well, actually, I shouldn't say that because I pretty much spent all of my gaming time on one game,
1578000	1583000	but I actually spent a lot of time, like for me, a large amount of time on Fable 2,
1583000	1588000	which is kind of one of those games I meant to check out last year, but you know, the holidays are so busy.
1588000	1591000	There were some games I said, look, I'm not going to get to these games until January, February.
1591000	1596000	Loki was good enough to loan me a copy of Fable 2, a legit copy, thank you,
1596000	1598000	based on what we talked about earlier in the show. This was a legit copy.
1598000	1603000	It's a lot of fun. I'm having way more fun with this one than I did the first game.
1603000	1604000	Are you being evil?
1604000	1606000	No, I'm being good.
1606000	1607000	I'm ambivalent.
1607000	1611000	I'm going to play it once good and then once evil, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.
1611000	1615000	Like, I really love how the world's very open, but this was the hilarious thing.
1615000	1619000	This struck me as great because I started playing it right after we wrapped last week's show,
1619000	1623000	and one of the big things, I know you weren't here, Dark Soccer, but one of the big things,
1623000	1628000	and Rice Princess was here, and her and Loki got into it over the story about Nintendo
1628000	1632000	and how Nintendo is going to be putting this, you know, they patented, I should say,
1632000	1636000	not necessarily putting this in, but patenting this mode where you're going to be able to just,
1636000	1639000	at a touch of a button, get little videos that help you with the game
1639000	1643000	and even just skip right over certain parts of the game or watch them played for you.
1643000	1645000	It's like basically turning games into movies or whatever,
1645000	1649000	and Loki was very vehemently against this, saying, like, I'm not going to buy the gown.
1649000	1654000	But what struck me as funny is that Fable 2 is almost one step away from that
1654000	1659000	because that little gold path really makes it easy to know where to go
1659000	1660000	and what kind of stuff to do.
1660000	1661000	But you have the option of turning it off.
1661000	1662000	That is true.
1662000	1666000	You can turn it off, and you can also turn this other thing off we were talking about last week.
1666000	1671000	Until I learned the world well enough, I actually kind of needed it.
1671000	1673000	I still definitely need it, but I veer from the path all the time
1673000	1676000	because I'm always afraid I'm going to miss treasure or something.
1676000	1679000	But the fantastic thing about this game is it reminds me a lot of Oblivion,
1679000	1683000	which is a game I really loved because there was just like an open world,
1683000	1686000	do whatever you want, go wherever type of thing.
1686000	1690000	But, you know, it has that multiplayer aspect to it,
1690000	1695000	and it's kind of in a much different art style, a much different presentation.
1695000	1699000	Well, the most important question about this, Rob, what did you name your dog?
1699000	1700000	Wienerschnitzel.
1700000	1702000	I named mine Dumbass.
1702000	1703000	Did you?
1703000	1705000	Because the dog is stupid.
1705000	1707000	Bark, bark, bark.
1707000	1710000	What? I already got that treasure box, stupid.
1710000	1713000	But I don't know. I'm having a lot of fun with the game,
1713000	1716000	just kind of running around and doing stuff and dancing for villagers
1716000	1719000	and trying to get people to marry me, although it hasn't been successful so far.
1719000	1721000	I guess I'm just not dancing enough or what.
1721000	1723000	There's something that you need to do, Rob.
1723000	1724000	Huh.
1724000	1727000	An achievement that you need to unlock, and this is one that Tiara told me about.
1727000	1728000	Okay.
1728000	1736000	When you get the pelvic thrust emote, then you need to go to the sheriff in the marketplace,
1736000	1741000	strip naked, target him, and do the pelvic thrust.
1741000	1743000	What happens? Do you get thrown in jail for a loop?
1743000	1748000	You find a thousand gold, and you get an achievement for it.
1748000	1752000	Is the achievement called that really drives you insane?
1752000	1754000	I think it's just called the perv or something like that.
1754000	1755000	Oh, that's a pervert.
1755000	1760000	And also, if you're playing with somebody and you dance together,
1760000	1763000	then you get more achievements for playing with friends and stuff.
1763000	1765000	That's cool. I haven't really been focused on the achievements.
1765000	1767000	I've gotten some just naturally playing through the game.
1767000	1770000	I got the achievement for being in an orgy. That was fun.
1770000	1772000	Yeah, the game's very adult.
1772000	1774000	You can get the polygamist.
1774000	1778000	I searched the drawers in one house, the cabinet or whatever, and I found a condom.
1778000	1782000	I was like, wow, this game's kind of an adult nature.
1782000	1785000	I was all in the ground and found condoms, okay?
1785000	1787000	It's so stupid. I was like, I don't want this. Ew.
1787000	1789000	Who would bury condoms in the ground?
1789000	1791000	God damn it. Dumbass the dog.
1791000	1794000	Wow, dumbass the condom-sniffing dog. Amazing.
1794000	1800000	That's it. We have to do a fable webcomic.
1800000	1805000	The Adventures of Little Sparrow and Dumbass the Dog.
1805000	1809000	Although I'm going by Master Chief because I have the special edition.
1809000	1811000	But yeah, I've just been having fun just kind of messing around.
1811000	1815000	The one thing I notice about Fable 2, your character never has to sleep.
1815000	1819000	Like ever. That's kind of interesting.
1819000	1820000	You can.
1820000	1825000	You can, but my character's been awake for like two weeks straight now.
1825000	1829000	If you have a house, Rob, I'll tell you this, and you haven't slept for a little while,
1829000	1836000	you can get the animal magnetism as your status or something, and if you sleep it goes away.
1836000	1837000	Interesting.
1837000	1839000	So you can actually be like ugly.
1839000	1844000	Right now my character needs to seriously buy a lot of celery.
1844000	1845000	For what?
1845000	1851000	Because she's been eating meat pie, and she's a little chubby.
1851000	1857000	ActDeafed in chat says, VGCats beat you to that webcomic idea and linked to VGCats recent edition.
1857000	1859000	I'll have to look at that a little later.
1859000	1861000	I haven't looked at VGCats in ages.
1861000	1869000	The rest of my gaming week, I have some news that might come as a bit of a shock to some of our regular listeners.
1869000	1875000	I made a conscious decision this morning to cancel my World of Warcraft account.
1875000	1877000	Why are you applauding that? Don't be mean.
1877000	1879000	I'll see how long it lasts.
1879000	1881000	She's skeptic.
1881000	1885000	No, but just, yeah, I cancelled it.
1885000	1886000	Why?
1886000	1887000	I don't need to say much more.
1887000	1894000	Nothing anybody did in game, no drama, nothing like that, but just kind of the thing that it really was starting to feel like.
1894000	1897000	Even I was starting to go, I'm playing this game too much.
1897000	1900000	So I pulled the plug, because I can do that.
1900000	1902000	I have enough self-control where I can do that.
1902000	1909000	So I might not have much, but I had enough where I was finally just able to recognize, you know what, I'm starting to treat this like a second job.
1909000	1910000	I need to step away.
1910000	1912000	At what point would you just say done?
1912000	1914000	I need to level up in real life for a little while.
1914000	1916000	So that's my big shocking news.
1916000	1918000	Yeah, we'll see how long it lasts.
1918000	1921000	I know, be skeptical, it's fine, I deserve it.
1921000	1924000	Especially after quitting and going back to Final Fantasy XI.
1924000	1928000	But I do want to make it clear, I did not quit World of Warcraft to go back to Final Fantasy XI.
1928000	1934000	I can safely say, I have had lulls, but I'm still playing Ragnarok online!
1934000	1937000	After eight years, nine years, sorry.
1937000	1944000	You know what, and now that I'm finally done with WoW for the foreseeable future, I should actually go check out Ragnarok for a little bit.
1944000	1948000	But I also, here's the problem, I don't want to ditch one MMO and then just go play another MMO.
1948000	1952000	The good thing about Ragnarok though, is that really, especially if you play on a private server, it's just like, oh whatever.
1952000	1953000	Yeah.
1953000	1955000	Okay, I'll do this, okay I'm done.
1955000	1958000	It's not like, ugh, grind!
1958000	1965000	Oh, actually Rob, I'll tell you what, I'm actually going to be joining another private server for a different game.
1965000	1969000	We are starting V.O.L. Army on Phantasy Star Online.
1969000	1970000	Really?
1970000	1971000	Another Blue Burst server.
1971000	1973000	Are those still around?
1973000	1977000	They are, and they have all the Japanese quest updates, and people are translating them.
1977000	1978000	Weird.
1978000	1980000	Is it official, or is it all under the table bootleg stuff?
1980000	1982000	It's all under the table, but Sega don't care.
1982000	1983000	Huh.
1983000	1986000	Sega was actually letting you transfer some of your characters over.
1986000	1990000	I really liked Phantasy Star Online, and that's not, you don't get that immersed in that, you know what I mean?
1990000	1991000	Yeah.
1991000	1997000	It's something that you can sit and play through a little bit, you can play it all day if you want to, you can play it a little bit if you want to.
1997000	1998000	Yeah.
1998000	2000000	And you can also kick wrappies.
2000000	2002000	Which is fantastic, I hate wrappies.
2002000	2004000	So, you should do that.
2004000	2005000	Alright.
2005000	2007000	As I say 100, Matt's suggesting I go back to DDR.
2007000	2011000	Actually, I would love to play DDR, but they don't really have a machine around here.
2011000	2013000	We should play.
2013000	2014000	We'll see, we'll see.
2014000	2015000	Alright, anyway.
2015000	2022000	Okay, we've talked plenty about gaming weeks, we're like more than 30 minutes into the show, we haven't even touched gaming news yet.
2022000	2024000	But first, I want to say housekeeping.
2024000	2025000	Real quick, housekeeping.
2025000	2027000	I think this is great.
2027000	2035000	Orange Lounge Radio, part of what makes this show so special and has made this show last so long is the fan community we have behind the show.
2035000	2045000	And the listeners that we have that come out on Sunday nights, you know, it might not be a huge group, you know, we don't have the following that some of these very large game spots, one ups, whatever the world have.
2045000	2055000	But, we have a small, loyal following, and they have put together a new little game, it's called Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
2055000	2061000	And it's like a DDR clone thing, I believe it's like an expansion you actually load into StepMania or something like that.
2061000	2067000	Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix, the demo or what have you was released, and you can load it into StepMania.
2067000	2071000	It's all these in-jokes from Orange Lounge Radio, but now in DDR.
2071000	2080000	Like they have Still Alive as one of the songs, and then I don't know, some recording of me singing a DDR song from like five years ago somehow made it in here.
2080000	2082000	Whatever, if that's what you want to hear.
2082000	2085000	They've got all these interesting little songs in there, so check that out.
2085000	2100000	It's available right there on our web forums at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, which also, if you weren't listening last week, there's a new Orange Lounge Radio website on the way, finally, and it's beautiful and we can't wait to get it launched.
2100000	2101000	Lies! Lies!
2101000	2103000	I know, I won't believe it until I see it either.
2103000	2105000	Well, you did too.
2105000	2108000	Big thanks to everybody in our community that helped out with that, because we didn't do anything.
2108000	2109000	We didn't.
2109000	2110000	We did.
2110000	2111000	Well.
2111000	2112000	That looks nice.
2112000	2115000	Yes, we approved it.
2115000	2119000	But this is why Jamie thinks she can start a cult, because shit like this happens.
2119000	2120000	She didn't ask for it.
2120000	2122000	It's been presented to her as a gift.
2122000	2123000	It's an offering.
2123000	2124000	They like to please me.
2124000	2126000	Is the Jamie pleased?
2126000	2129000	My people. My people.
2129000	2130000	My people.
2130000	2131000	Alright, anyhow.
2131000	2133000	Let's go ahead and get into gaming news.
2133000	2135000	We haven't talked to anything about gaming news yet.
2135000	2136000	Let's please get into that.
2136000	2137000	Yes we did.
2137000	2138000	What?
2138000	2141000	Well, you know, we talked about Scratch.
2141000	2143000	That was more of like a gaming exclusive.
2143000	2146000	Let's get into the news that you read everywhere else on the internet now.
2146000	2147000	Yes.
2147000	2150000	Of course, we are big fans of Katamari.
2150000	2157000	And, you know, Takahashi's brand new game, Noby Noby Boy, which I still don't know what exactly you have to do in this.
2157000	2160000	But ironically, Katamari is not fans of us.
2160000	2161000	Yes.
2161000	2164000	How I forget.
2164000	2165000	How 2006 with me, I know.
2165000	2166000	I know.
2166000	2172000	Anyways, Noby Noby Boy will be available on the Playstation Network February 19th.
2172000	2175000	It is coming out at a whopping five bucks.
2175000	2177000	Hell yeah.
2177000	2178000	That's a price I could pay.
2178000	2179000	The price is right.
2179000	2182000	Now, has anybody figured out what the hell you do in this game yet?
2182000	2184000	It looks like a really fucked up version of Snake.
2184000	2190000	You, I guess, stretch and eat things.
2190000	2191000	I don't know.
2191000	2192000	It's kind of creepy.
2192000	2197000	They should make a live action movie where, like, Noby Noby Boy is, like, devouring the world.
2197000	2202000	It's like replace all the tripods from War of the Worlds with Noby Noby Boy.
2202000	2204000	That'd be hilarious.
2204000	2205000	But anyways, no.
2205000	2213000	No idea, but there is going to be some sort of thing that, I guess, Noby Noby Girl, which you don't see in the game.
2213000	2219000	As you're playing the game and stretching and becoming longer, Noby Noby Girl gets longer as well.
2219000	2227000	And all the combined, basically everybody in the world that's playing this game contributes to her getting longer.
2227000	2232000	And after she gets, you know, so long, it unlocks a new level for you.
2232000	2235000	So everybody is kind of working to unlock new levels.
2235000	2237000	That's just a cute idea.
2237000	2242000	That reminds me of old school, and here I go with the music game stuff again, but it reminds me of old school DDR Max 2.
2242000	2246000	With the unlocks that, you know, you basically have to play the game over and over and over again.
2246000	2249000	It's something the whole arcade community basically had to do to do the unlock.
2249000	2251000	Which I think is an excellent idea.
2251000	2256000	And then they release the codes, which retarded the whole thing, basically, by releasing the codes.
2256000	2261000	The world, the clouds look like tasty fluffy donuts.
2261000	2264000	Don't talk about food, you're going to make me hungry.
2264000	2268000	Are they talking about releasing a demo or anything so I can at least try this game out?
2268000	2274000	Or am I just going to have to basically throw $5 into the wind and hope that, you know, just because it has the Katamari guy's name on it, it's cool?
2274000	2278000	There's no mention of a demo at all, but most of the PSN games do get demos.
2278000	2280000	Some do not, but most of them do.
2280000	2283000	What ever happened to him making childhood playground equipment?
2283000	2285000	I think he has.
2285000	2286000	Interesting.
2286000	2291000	And you know, I don't want to know what his playground equipment looks like.
2291000	2296000	Since he always comes up with these crazy things that eat things and roll over things and absorb them.
2296000	2298000	Probably kind of scary.
2298000	2305000	It's like Takahashi's Borg playground equipment, become one, assimilate into the playground equipment.
2305000	2310000	Well, also on PlayStation Network, LittleBigPlanet has not released anything in a little while.
2310000	2314000	They had that big Metal Gear Solid thing right before Christmas, and they were kind of on holiday break.
2314000	2321000	But they are coming back, apparently, on January 26th, I believe, which is tomorrow?
2321000	2323000	I think that might be over in the UK, I don't know.
2323000	2329000	But basically as of this next week, you're going to start to see some new costumes show up on the PlayStation Network.
2329000	2331000	It starts with the Chinese New Year costumes.
2331000	2332000	Oh, I see.
2332000	2336000	They come out on January 26th, the rest of the costumes go with the regular updates.
2336000	2339000	The cool thing is the Chinese New Year costumes are going to be free.
2339000	2343000	They haven't said exactly how much the other packs are going to cost.
2343000	2349000	Including a Groundhog Day costume, a Valentine's Day mini pack, an Ape Escape costume, and a Toro costume.
2349000	2351000	Both of which are from Japan.
2351000	2353000	And a Wipeout costume kit.
2353000	2354000	Which is kind of interesting.
2354000	2359000	But what I also thought was, and caught my eye, was on January 29th, with the Groundhog Day costume,
2359000	2362000	a God of War mini pack is coming out with a Kratos costume.
2362000	2365000	And I don't know if that means a God of War level thing?
2365000	2367000	Which it sounds like it might be.
2367000	2371000	That would be the download content that was available if you pre-ordered the game and game stuff.
2371000	2373000	That's the other thing I'm wondering.
2373000	2374000	Or is it just the...
2374000	2376000	Well, I got one of those.
2376000	2378000	Even though I didn't pre-order the game, they gave me the slip anyway.
2378000	2379000	It was only a costume.
2379000	2380000	It wasn't a lot of other stuff.
2380000	2382000	There were stickers also that were with that, I think.
2382000	2384000	Were there? Maybe there were. I just don't remember getting them.
2384000	2388000	Because remember the big controversy was someone made a level, a God of War level with those stickers
2388000	2390000	and it got banned from there because...
2390000	2395000	Well then if that's coming out, where's the Heavenly Sword and all the other stuff that was supposed to come out too?
2395000	2396000	That's my other question.
2396000	2397000	Well...
2397000	2398000	Later?
2398000	2399000	Hmm.
2399000	2400000	I guess so.
2400000	2404000	But I guess this would be a sign for those that got frustrated because they didn't get the pre-order bundle.
2404000	2408000	They will be able to get the content, although you can betcha it's going to cost money.
2408000	2409000	You can betcha.
2409000	2411000	It'll cost money.
2411000	2412000	Especially in this economy.
2412000	2414000	They gotta make money wherever they can, right?
2414000	2415000	I guess so.
2415000	2418000	But, you know, money is...
2418000	2419000	Wonderful.
2419000	2425000	I was gonna say running short and the recession's hitting, you know.
2425000	2428000	It's really on a worldwide basis.
2428000	2439000	Eidos closed, they're actually closing their Manchester studio so that they can do just the big name games
2439000	2441000	instead of, you know, developing smaller ones.
2441000	2448000	They wanna put as quoted as high quality titles that will deliver long term franchise value.
2448000	2450000	Whatever.
2450000	2457000	So basically it's just 14 people and all they did was make mobile games.
2457000	2458000	But...
2458000	2461000	Still, for those 14 people, you know.
2461000	2464000	And there's been a lot of, you know, just cutback news across the industry.
2464000	2466000	Every week we're reporting on something.
2466000	2470000	And, you know, I know when we were doing the call earlier with Bobby Blackwell from the show before us,
2470000	2475000	you know, he's been joking about how his show is just one downer after another.
2475000	2478000	Not, you know, because it's bad content.
2478000	2481000	But just the news has just been layoff, layoff, layoff.
2481000	2484000	And then even, you know what, I don't know if you guys know this.
2484000	2487000	I think we talked about it a little on the show last week.
2487000	2492000	But there was the Gamerscore blog at Xbox site that, you know, they did a lot for the community.
2492000	2496000	And in fact, they were a big reason why we were able to get our gamer pic.
2496000	2499000	They worked with all games for us to get our gamer pic on Xbox Live Marketplace.
2499000	2501000	The team was laid off on Thursday.
2501000	2502000	Aww.
2502000	2504000	I know. Bummer, huh?
2504000	2506000	That's just...
2506000	2512000	It's especially kinda, ooh, kinda hit you right in the gut when some of these people were famous for the podcasts
2512000	2516000	and vidcasts that they had developed that caught Microsoft's eye and hired them on.
2516000	2519000	And some of them had, like, relocated themselves out there.
2519000	2523000	And unfortunately, the world works in mysterious ways.
2523000	2529000	But for what it's worth, I was laid off about seven years ago from a job I really enjoyed.
2529000	2532000	It had nothing to do with gaming, but it was just, you know, the people and stuff.
2532000	2540000	And getting laid off from that job led me to a job that eventually I liked so much more in, like, a full career.
2540000	2546000	So, you know, I'm hoping that others, although, you know, are getting laid off and stuff,
2546000	2550000	hopefully when things settle down and the economy starts to come back,
2550000	2553000	because what goes down must go back up eventually,
2553000	2557000	people are gonna find something they really, really like and hopefully it won't be such a bad thing.
2557000	2561000	So, that's my little philosophical moment for the day.
2561000	2566000	Sorry to be Miss Sunshine, but, you know, I'm just a ray of freaking sunshine today, aren't I?
2566000	2568000	You're poopin' rainbows.
2568000	2572000	Somehow I don't think I'd be welcomed in your cult, pooping rainbows.
2572000	2574000	Sure, you can poop some rainbows in my cult.
2574000	2576000	Right. That's what I do.
2576000	2581000	Rob is the high priest of rainbow poop.
2581000	2584000	Well, you make it sound so dignified.
2584000	2589000	Alright, anyway, sorry to those 14 folks. Hopefully they'll bounce back eventually.
2589000	2597000	Yeah. Well, in other fun news, there's another PSP firmware update.
2597000	2599000	Hooray!
2599000	2605000	You may remember there was an exploit that was recently discovered using GripShift
2605000	2611000	that would allow people to run homebrew on a PSP 3000 system.
2611000	2620000	Well, you can imagine that this new 5.03 firmware addresses security vulnerabilities.
2620000	2625000	And basically it's layman's terms for we fixed the GripShift exploit, now you can't do it anymore.
2625000	2632000	So if you want to run homebrew onto your, you know, PSP 3000, I suggest that you don't update your system yet
2632000	2635000	and just wait for them to find another way.
2635000	2642000	The few more days before they figure out a way to put a custom firmware onto the PSP 3000 and then it won't matter anymore.
2642000	2644000	How many days has it been since this came out?
2644000	2646000	Man, like a week or so.
2646000	2649000	Ooh, they're slackin'. The hacking community's slackin'.
2649000	2652000	Usually it takes them, what, like 48 hours to get around the latest Sony patch?
2652000	2656000	It's a new, firmwares aren't, I mean, making new firmwares is not a big deal.
2656000	2661000	And a lot of times if it's something like this that just fixes one little vulnerability,
2661000	2663000	they're not going to make a custom firmware for it.
2663000	2668000	But developing a firmware for a new system like the PSP 3000, that's different.
2668000	2671000	Because they have to find a way to load it on there and that kind of stuff.
2671000	2673000	So that's a little bit complicated.
2673000	2679000	But once they do that, then, you know, any other updates, like say a 5.1 or 5.2 or something like that,
2679000	2683000	that change a few things, add a couple features, those they can incorporate pretty easy.
2683000	2688000	Because they normally don't change the firmware too much from update to update.
2688000	2692000	They're just adding different things or updating different PRXs and stuff.
2692000	2698000	Alrighty. Well, you know, we don't get to report very often about PSP games that sound pretty interesting
2698000	2702000	because, you know, not to say there's like no interesting games on PSP, but it's been a little while.
2702000	2705000	The PSP's been kind of lacking on a lot of the big games lately.
2705000	2711000	But this game sounds kind of interesting. It's a game called Yusha 30, which translates to the name Brave 30.
2711000	2714000	And apparently this showed up, I think, in a recent edition of Fumicha magazine.
2714000	2718000	It's a countdown that everyone thought that was Zelda 2.
2718000	2723000	Oh, okay. I see. Well, what it is, it actually ends up being a game that,
2723000	2729000	the 30 plays a significant thing in the game because you play four different games,
2729000	2732000	but you play them 30 seconds a piece.
2732000	2737000	Each of the four games has their own character, their own mode, like one of them's a side scroller,
2737000	2741000	one of them's a shooter, one of them's a strategy game, and one of them's an action game.
2741000	2744000	But you play them 30 seconds at a time.
2744000	2747000	And there's, I guess, some type of clock in the middle of the screen,
2747000	2751000	and then after the 30 seconds is up, you go to another mini-game.
2751000	2758000	Interesting. I don't know, but a game like WarioWare that's made up of nothing but 30 second games is actually kind of cool.
2758000	2764000	So this could be very interesting. I don't know. It's very Japan.
2764000	2768000	But I wonder if they'll bring it over here. Looks like it could be kind of cool.
2768000	2773000	Maybe. Game Guru says, so it's WarioWare with less games. I don't know, not necessarily.
2773000	2777000	It could be that, you know, the mini-games are all different types of side scrolling games,
2777000	2782000	different types of shooting games. But I would say it's, yeah, like a WarioWare meets an RPG,
2782000	2785000	like Act F says. Sounds a little bit like it. I don't know.
2785000	2788000	It'll be hard to say until I can actually play the game, right?
2788000	2792000	So we'll see. That'll be coming out eventually.
2792000	2798000	Well, here's something for our rumor mill, if we don't mind.
2798000	2803000	Actually, I'm sorry, that's not a rumor mill. I was looking at the wrong story.
2803000	2805000	Well, no.
2805000	2810000	I'm just pissed off over my USB gloves. They're not warming up.
2810000	2812000	I have USB handwarming gloves.
2812000	2814000	How exactly hot can USB handwarming gloves get?
2814000	2818000	They're freaking hot, because I got the cheap shitty ones that don't have any padding on the inside,
2818000	2822000	so it's like, I'm going to burn your palms now.
2822000	2826000	So I have to use them, though, with my USB hub, and they don't get as hot using my hub.
2826000	2829000	Anyway, so how about some Wipeout love?
2829000	2831000	Wipeout?
2831000	2834000	Actually, this actually is a rumor.
2834000	2846000	Sony is considering bringing a port of Wipeout to the PSP, as you know.
2846000	2847000	PS2.
2847000	2849000	PS2, sorry.
2849000	2857000	Bringing Wipeout to PS2 has actually got the information from a European release list,
2857000	2859000	so hey, maybe that could be it.
2859000	2862000	It's actually Wipeout Pulse, sorry.
2862000	2872000	And also, other things on that particular list is one of them is Fat Princess to be out in March.
2872000	2874000	I really don't know.
2874000	2877000	That game looked kind of cute, but again, it's one of those things where it's like,
2877000	2881000	a lot of these PlayStation Network games, like we see trailers and teasers for them,
2881000	2883000	and it's like, WTF?
2883000	2885000	I need to know more about these games.
2885000	2888000	Like, put this up there, Fat Princess up there with this Noby Noby boy or whatever.
2888000	2890000	Kind of interesting.
2890000	2893000	It's the PSP one? Is the PSP going to the PS2 again?
2893000	2894000	Yes.
2894000	2898000	Okay, that makes sense then.
2898000	2900000	Alright, well, we'll see.
2900000	2902000	I mean, I like the Wipeout games. I have the download one.
2902000	2904000	I have the NEGCon.
2904000	2908000	I'm glad to have another reason to use it.
2908000	2910000	Alright.
2910000	2914000	Well, there's some other games coming out in case you can't wait until March.
2914000	2920000	This week there's a few games, starting off with MLB Front Office Manager
2920000	2923000	on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.
2923000	2927000	Kind of the baseball take on NFL Head Coach.
2927000	2934000	Also on PS3 and Xbox 360, Afro Samurai coming to us from Namco Bandai.
2934000	2936000	Looks pretty cool.
2936000	2938000	Very bloody.
2938000	2944000	Movie tie-in game Coraline coming out on Wii and PS2.
2944000	2946000	I don't think there's a DS for that.
2946000	2948000	Looks okay.
2948000	2951000	On DS, Imagine Cheerleader.
2951000	2954000	Yet another game geared towards girls.
2954000	2958000	And then, kind of a neat little DS game, The Chase.
2958000	2960000	Felix meets Felicity.
2960000	2963000	This is supposed to play a little bit like Kirby's Canvas Curse.
2963000	2970000	And basically you're running through a city trying to avoid things so you can get to your date.
2970000	2972000	Which is kind of neat.
2972000	2974000	Some other stuff.
2974000	2976000	Oh, there is a DS version for Coraline.
2976000	2978000	How'd I miss that?
2978000	2984000	Nobunaga's Ambition Iron Triangle for PS2.
2984000	2986000	They're still putting those games out.
2986000	2988000	Crazy.
2988000	2994000	And then probably one that a lot of people are waiting for, DJ Max Fever on PSP this week.
2994000	2999000	And some games that people are not waiting for, Jojo's Fashion Show for the DS.
2999000	3000000	What?
3000000	3005000	And Petz Horse's Ranch on DS as well.
3005000	3009000	And also supposedly this week, although I think it's next week,
3009000	3012000	Rygar the Battle of Argus on the Wii.
3012000	3014000	And that is it.
3014000	3020000	You know, I saw a song list for the DJ Max game show up on, I think it was Bamani Style,
3020000	3023000	one of those websites that's still very exclusive on their music games.
3023000	3027000	And I'm a little disappointed because I have to say this.
3027000	3031000	Look, I understand DJ Max has this very rabid fan base and is very popular,
3031000	3033000	especially amongst those that like the K-pop and all this.
3033000	3036000	But do they really want to sell this game or not?
3036000	3039000	Because I'm looking at the song list and it's telling me they don't want to sell this game
3039000	3042000	to anybody who's not a hardcore music game fan.
3042000	3045000	And I don't mean that as a slam against the game because, you know,
3045000	3050000	it's kind of a neat little 2DX clone for your PSP or whatever you want to call it.
3050000	3054000	But there's not a damn licensed song on the list, at least that I can recognize.
3054000	3057000	I read this whole list and I don't recognize any of these songs.
3057000	3061000	I realize DJ Max fans recognize these songs from the Korean version of the game.
3061000	3063000	But they already import the Korean version.
3063000	3068000	You have to understand, you are like the minority of the minority of the minority of video game buyers.
3068000	3074000	Like, the rest of those people, what is going to be the incentive for them to buy this game?
3074000	3075000	You know what I mean?
3075000	3077000	There is no incentive.
3077000	3079000	And I know, and some people scoff.
3079000	3081000	What, licensed songs and DJ Max?
3081000	3083000	Well, do they want to sell it or not?
3083000	3089000	I mean, I just, I'm kind of surprised that with them kind of trying to put out this game in the US,
3089000	3093000	they don't want to give me something I would know.
3093000	3099000	Again, you know, I respect DJ Max, I understand why it has such a loyal following and all that stuff,
3099000	3104000	but there's, they're not going to win over any new people with this strategy.
3104000	3105000	Does that make sense?
3105000	3106000	Yeah.
3106000	3110000	So, I guess that's just me.
3110000	3115000	Oh, I just like the ad before you start, Japanese release dates.
3115000	3116000	Yes.
3116000	3118000	And this kind of ties in with Japanese release dates.
3118000	3126000	I preordered the Blu-ray of Advent Children, the one with Final Fantasy XIII, the demos.
3126000	3127000	Nice.
3127000	3129000	And I'm having that bitch overnighted when it comes out.
3129000	3130000	Nice.
3130000	3131000	In April.
3131000	3132000	When does that come out?
3132000	3133000	April.
3133000	3134000	That would be awesome.
3134000	3137000	We will have Final Fantasy XIII.
3137000	3139000	Fire up the Justin TV for that again.
3139000	3140000	Hell yeah.
3140000	3144000	Also, hey, speaking of Blu-ray, if Dark Soccer can do a book review, I can do a Blu-ray review.
3144000	3147000	I bought on a whim, Repo, the genetic opera on DVD.
3147000	3148000	It's awesome.
3148000	3152000	It's from the guy who did Saw, and I think the Saw movies are kind of dumb.
3152000	3154000	Or no, I think he did Saw 2 and 3 and all that.
3154000	3158000	I think those movies are kind of dumb, but this movie was awesome.
3158000	3163000	It's like a 70s glam rock, but it's like an opera, and it's a horror movie.
3163000	3164000	It's amazing.
3164000	3167000	Anyway, I just wanted to say that, because Usain Blu-ray reminded me of that.
3167000	3173000	Comments from chat, I went on that thing about DJ Max, GS68, who I know is a big DJ Max fan.
3173000	3177000	He called and did the review on the arcade version before on the show.
3177000	3180000	GS68 says, it's DJ Max. I don't expect licensed song.
3180000	3183000	Yeah, I know you don't, but again, you're the minority.
3183000	3185000	Surely you understand that.
3185000	3189000	It's just like back in the day, there weren't that many licensed songs in DDR.
3189000	3197000	Whereas fans of DDR didn't care if they brought a DDR game over here that had no licensed songs,
3197000	3199000	just all Konami artists.
3199000	3208000	If you're trying to expand your audience, or bring it over to basically introduce people that haven't played DJ Max,
3208000	3211000	it's easier to do that with songs that they may recognize.
3211000	3214000	They can go, hey, this is in there, I can play this.
3214000	3217000	Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be successful.
3217000	3223000	I mean, look at Beatmania, which tried to do that as well, and that didn't work out too well.
3223000	3225000	So, I don't know.
3225000	3236000	Well, okay, but the thing is, though, that, you know, again, DDR didn't really gain steam here until well into the PlayStation 2 mixes.
3236000	3240000	You know what I mean? Like, we had that first mix on PlayStation, which was, you know, even the fans laughed at it.
3240000	3244000	Conomics, which was basically fan service, nothing but.
3244000	3248000	Then we started getting into, like, you know, DDR Max on the PlayStation 2.
3248000	3255000	And then, really, I think probably about Max 2 was when we really started to see, like, a lot more licensed songs in the US DDR games,
3255000	3257000	and that's also when the game took off.
3257000	3259000	Really took off.
3259000	3262000	You know, the first few games showed it was probable.
3262000	3264000	Maybe the same thing will happen with DJ Max.
3264000	3266000	I don't know, but we'll see.
3266000	3268000	Anyway, sorry.
3268000	3274000	I think, if anything, what will help DJ Max will be DJ Max Technica when it comes out in the DS.
3274000	3279000	And if they decide to bring that over here, because there's a lot more people that play the DS,
3279000	3285000	and, you know, if they decide, maybe throw in a couple, like, I'd say even five licensed songs,
3285000	3288000	and that'd probably be maybe enough to get people to kind of look at it.
3288000	3290000	Well, we'll see. We'll see.
3290000	3294000	Anyhow, a lot of music game talk tonight. It's almost like the OLR of yesteryear.
3294000	3298000	Japanese release dates. Talking about games that are going to be coming out in Japan this week.
3298000	3301000	Ninja Blade on the Xbox 360, January 29th.
3301000	3302000	It's pretty fun.
3302000	3306000	As well as Tom Clancy's End War and Tomb Raider Underworld come out on the Xbox 360.
3306000	3308000	Heading over to the PlayStation 3.
3308000	3313000	Tomb Raider Underworld also shows up in Japan, as well as Lost Planet Extreme Condition getting a price reduction.
3313000	3315000	Again, that's in Japan.
3315000	3317000	Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii.
3317000	3320000	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time.
3320000	3323000	I anticipate there'll probably be a few people that want to import that sucker.
3323000	3327000	That finally shows up on the Nintendo Wii. It's been forever.
3327000	3329000	Wasn't Crystal Chronicles supposed to be a launch game?
3329000	3331000	Yeah.
3331000	3333000	And then it's kind of changed quite a bit.
3333000	3336000	On the PlayStation 2, hey, funny, wouldn't you know it?
3336000	3342000	Dance Dance Revolution X gets its debut in Japan this week on the PlayStation 2.
3342000	3344000	And the Japanese versions are always better somehow.
3344000	3350000	AR Tenelico 2, Melody of Metaphalika Premium Edition comes out also in PlayStation 2.
3350000	3352000	See, you didn't butcher that like I did last week.
3352000	3353000	What?
3353000	3356000	I said you didn't butcher that like I did last week.
3356000	3357000	Oh, sorry.
3357000	3361000	Soul Eater Battle Resonance comes out in Japan.
3361000	3362000	Do you want?
3362000	3364000	What is this game all about?
3364000	3366000	It's based off of a manga that's pretty hardcore cool.
3366000	3367000	Cool.
3367000	3369000	Trying to build, like, the ultimate weapon.
3369000	3375000	Also a game called Harukanaro Toki no Naka de Yuminoko Hihashi comes out.
3375000	3377000	Special comes out as well. I have no idea.
3377000	3382000	But that's from Koei, so I bet anything is some type of RPG.
3382000	3388000	It was previously released on the Nintendo DS to celebrate Koei's 30th anniversary.
3388000	3393000	Some more scenes that now have Voiced and all that, so it's a DS game upgrade.
3393000	3398000	On the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time also gets its release on the DS this week in Japan.
3398000	3406000	Civilization Revolution gets a localized release for Japan, as well as a game called Vampire Kishi DS comes out from D3.
3406000	3410000	Sims 2 gets price reduction over in Japan if you haven't checked that out yet and you want to.
3410000	3422000	And lastly, on the Sony PSP, Memories Off No. 5, Togerita Film comes out, as well as Princess Maker 4 Portable gets a price reduction.
3422000	3431000	But probably the price reduction you're more interested in is Rockman Dash and Rockman Dash 2 coming out together in a value pack this week in Japan.
3431000	3439000	Also, by the way, actually a couple other games, Soul Eater Battle Resonance gets released on the PSP and Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2.
3439000	3449000	There you have it, your Japanese release dates. Let's move on over to the kingdom that is united, the UK.
3449000	3451000	Dork.
3451000	3452000	Yes.
3452000	3460000	Actually, really not a whole lot of anything. Two games on the 30th, Cake Mania 2 and the chase Felix Meets Felicity.
3460000	3463000	Cake Mania.
3463000	3467000	And Felix Meets Felicity. These sound like real winners.
3467000	3469000	Chase is supposed to be pretty good.
3469000	3470000	If it's Felix the Cat.
3470000	3480000	No, it's the Chase. It's that one that's coming out in the US also. It looked okay. It's different, but is different appreciated? Not always. I don't know.
3480000	3482000	Alright, there you have it, your UK release dates.
3482000	3490000	Something else that might be appreciated is the new PopCap game, Pagle. Well, it's not that new, but it's new to Xbox Live Arcade.
3490000	3497000	It's supposed to be coming out in the first half of 09, if I were to guess, probably March, since I think that's when the DS version comes out.
3497000	3505000	And that's also when the new PopCap Arcade hits, Volume 2, which also features Pagle.
3505000	3508000	So it makes sense that it would come out before that.
3508000	3512000	Haha. There's logic for you.
3512000	3514000	No word on what the price is going to be.
3514000	3521000	Apparently people are thinking though that it's going to be 100 Microsoft points. Makes perfect sense, because I think all the other PopCap games were also 10 bucks.
3521000	3524000	Did you hear about the leak on Twitter about the iPhone version of Pagle?
3524000	3527000	I don't think that's really a leak.
3527000	3538000	I thought that news was kind of already out there, but apparently they made a tweet about the iPhone Pagle, which by the way, I believe was in response to our very own DJ Tyrant who used to do a show on our old station.
3538000	3551000	I remember, because I follow PopCap and DJ on Twitter, and he said something about, like, I was just playing Pagle, the game is fun or something like that, I wish I had it on the iPhone or whatever.
3551000	3561000	And then PopCap I think made that response, I don't remember, I'm sorry if I misappropriated this information, but I remember it came up right after that conversation, is that PopCap made this tweet like, oh yeah, it's going to come out on the iPhone.
3561000	3564000	And then the tweet disappeared and all the game blogs jumped on it.
3564000	3572000	But I was always kind of like, I thought they had already said that Pagle was going to come out on the iPhone. I mean, duh, right?
3572000	3580000	I mean, even if it wasn't said, is it really that hard to figure out? What systems doesn't PopCap write for? Right?
3580000	3581000	Yeah.
3581000	3591000	But just interesting, and somebody said it best on Twitter earlier this week, Twitter's becoming the place where people are actually getting the news, and that's kind of scary.
3591000	3595000	Well, Rob, do you watch much CNN?
3595000	3601000	I read CNN.com, but I reload that a lot at work, but I don't watch the station.
3601000	3615000	I want to say, I think it's the Situation Room, but one of the programs on there actually reads comments off Twitter, the CNN Twitter, and responds to comments about stories that are going on.
3615000	3616000	Yeah, we used to do that.
3616000	3617000	Kind of like how we use our chat room.
3617000	3618000	Yeah, it's crazy.
3618000	3621000	We used to do the Twit thing, but we stopped.
3621000	3627000	Actually, you know what's funny? I was going to bring back the Twitter thing tonight, and I'm not just saying that. Look, I already had it reloaded.
3627000	3629000	Already here on the screen, ready to go. I was going to do it during the break.
3629000	3632000	All right, all right. I was just going to say, yeah.
3632000	3634000	Yes, we are bringing back the Twitter interactivity tonight.
3634000	3642000	There are things that I normally post on my Twitter that are news-related. Thank you for reminding me. I completely forgot about it.
3642000	3645000	What did you post on your Twitter? Can I go back and read them on air?
3645000	3648000	Go right ahead. I don't care.
3648000	3656000	Let me see. Because I don't remember. Sometimes, a lot of the things you write on Twitter, you've already told me about in the past.
3656000	3658000	Sometimes.
3658000	3664000	You talked about Scratch. Oh, the Lego game. Nobody caught that one, huh?
3664000	3665000	No.
3665000	3670000	You figured out Lego Rock Band is shit, and you know what the new Lego game is.
3670000	3671000	Yeah.
3671000	3674000	You want to find out? Go find Loki's Twitter. I'm not going to read it for you.
3674000	3677000	It's probably just one of them.
3677000	3683000	All right. I'm sure they're going to do a million Lego games anyway. Hey, let's talk about another game they're going to do a million of.
3683000	3693000	Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero Metallica is on its way, and Metallica themselves have decided to leak what is going to be the complete song list of the game.
3693000	3698000	I'm not going to read through every single song here. I'll just kind of mention some of the songs that catch my eye.
3698000	3714000	Creeping Death, Enter Sandman, Fade to Black, Fuel, King Nothing, Master of Puppets, Nothing Else Matters, One, Seek and Destroy, Memory Remains, hopefully with Marianne Faithful intact because that song is awesome because of her.
3714000	3718000	The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Whiplash.
3718000	3728000	Some other artists that are showing up in the game, Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Foo Fighters, Judas Priest, Leonard Skynard.
3728000	3729000	Is it Turn the Page?
3729000	3730000	Yeah, it's Turn the Page.
3730000	3733000	Why don't they just do Metallica's cover?
3733000	3738000	I don't know. Leonard Skynard is in it. Motorhead.
3738000	3740000	Cool. Ace of Spades?
3740000	3746000	Yes, Ace of Spades. Queen with Stone Cold Crazy.
3746000	3748000	You know what? I just figured it out.
3748000	3749000	What?
3749000	3752000	Those are all songs that Metallica has covered.
3752000	3754000	I think a lot of these are, yeah.
3754000	3757000	Because the Garage Inc album, remember?
3757000	3759000	Oh, that's right.
3759000	3769000	I know they've done Stone Cold Crazy because I've got it on my phone. They've done the other one.
3769000	3771000	Ace of Spades?
3771000	3779000	I don't remember if they did Ace of Spades, but I know that they did Turn the Page because that's one of my favorite covers of that song ever.
3779000	3786000	Also Slayer, Social Distortion, System of a Down, Thin Lizzy, lots of stuff in here.
3786000	3790000	I do want to also mention, this is what I thought was kind of interesting also.
3790000	3799000	If you have the download content that was the Death Magnetic CD for download, it will actually work the ten tracks into the game's campaign mode.
3799000	3808000	If you already own World Tour on Wii or Playstation 2, you'll get Broken, Beaten, Scarred, Cyanide, and My Apocalypse.
3808000	3814000	They'll already be on the disc for you since download content is kind of different on Wii and Playstation 2.
3814000	3817000	I thought that kind of interaction was interesting.
3817000	3820000	And they also announced that, what was it?
3820000	3828000	The game will be coming on PS3 and Xbox 360 at the end of March on the 29th and then the PS2 and Wii later.
3828000	3837000	Now the question is, this isn't set up like World Tour with the other instrument setups or anything?
3837000	3840000	No, it is. It's basically like Rock Band now.
3840000	3844000	Well, damn it. I'm going to have to buy it because it's Metallica.
3844000	3849000	Wow. What role will Metallica play in your cult?
3849000	3852000	The official band of the universe.
3852000	3855000	Alright.
3855000	3857000	Not interested. Sorry.
3857000	3861000	Yeah, I quit your cult. No, I'm just kidding.
3861000	3865000	I thought Abba got to be the official band of the universe. I'm very disappointed.
3865000	3868000	Abba gets official pop band of the universe.
3868000	3869000	Alright, fair enough.
3869000	3871000	See, that would be a game right there.
3871000	3875000	Tweak62 says 80s Metallica is great, 90s Metallica is pretty okay.
3875000	3880000	They should have a game where 80s Metallica battles 90s Metallica and see who wins.
3880000	3883000	How about Abba vs. Metallica?
3883000	3884000	That should be a game.
3884000	3887000	Alas, Abba, we knew you well.
3887000	3890000	As you get stomped in the face by Lars Ulrich.
3890000	3895000	No, all Abba would have to do is dress Metallica.
3895000	3900000	Alright, anyway. Let's move on with more news.
3900000	3901000	Do we gotta...
3901000	3903000	Of course. That's what we do on this show. I don't know if you heard.
3903000	3905000	Virtual Console!
3905000	3906000	Hey, hey.
3906000	3909000	There's stuff out.
3909000	3910000	This is UK stuff, right?
3910000	3912000	I like stuff.
3912000	3922000	Coming out to Virtual Console in the UK is Mario Golf for 1000 Wii points because it was Nintendo 64 game.
3922000	3928000	And Wonder Boy in Monsterland from the Sega Master System, which will be 500 Wii points.
3928000	3933000	You know what's funny? We were just playing that like three days ago.
3933000	3934000	Well, Dan was. I wasn't.
3934000	3935000	Awesome.
3935000	3941000	We had our entire Sega, well not our entire Sega collection, but we at least had the Genesis world portion of it sitting out.
3941000	3943000	And then Dan brought out the Master System.
3943000	3945000	So, we were just playing this the other day.
3945000	3946000	Very cool.
3946000	3947000	Yep.
3947000	3948000	Very cool.
3948000	3952000	I haven't been following Virtual Console in the US. What did we get? Do you remember?
3952000	3953000	Anybody remember?
3953000	3956000	Stuff. I don't know. I don't buy anything on Virtual Console.
3956000	3958000	I haven't either. It's been a long time.
3958000	3963000	I haven't fired up the Wii in a while either now that I've ruined Animal Crossing for my wife again.
3963000	3965000	Did your wife officially quit Animal Crossing?
3965000	3968000	Yeah, she's done with it because I ruined it for her. I started cheating.
3968000	3969000	Sorry to hear it.
3969000	3974000	That's because, you know, I got bored with it. There's nothing more I can really do.
3974000	3976000	What else was there to do but cheat?
3976000	3982000	Exactly. It's fun to cheat. It's fun to steal. Like, especially when those animals piss you off because they're being just assholes.
3982000	3986000	And you just go into their house and steal all their shit. It's like, ha! How do you-
3986000	3987000	How do you steal their stuff?
3987000	3992000	There's a code. There's a code where you can pick up their stuff, furniture, move it around.
3992000	3996000	The only thing is it doesn't save it, I don't think, so you can't just do that.
3996000	4002000	But it did sort of in the game that we played because I stole all the stuff and they have, like, crap on the floor now.
4002000	4006000	It was just, like, random junk that was lying around.
4006000	4010000	You know what I would love to see? It's been a while since we've had an OLR dream game.
4010000	4019000	I would love to see a game that kind of takes that art style of Animal Crossing or what have you and mixes it with, like, Grand Theft Auto.
4019000	4021000	I was on the same page with you.
4021000	4025000	When a villager pisses me off, I want to put a hit on him.
4025000	4029000	So what you're basically saying is you would like to see a game that's like Grand Theft Auto but-
4029000	4033000	Don't even say Happy Tree Friends because that shit ain't gonna cut it.
4033000	4035000	That game was shit, okay?
4035000	4039000	No, I'm not saying the game was shit. I'm talking about the actual show.
4039000	4045000	But even then, Happy Tree Friends is- the violence is almost, like, so ultra-violent that it's crap. You know what I mean?
4045000	4046000	Like, Happy Tree Friends-
4046000	4047000	It got really old.
4047000	4049000	It got really old, exactly. Happy Tree Friends got really old.
4049000	4051000	I watched three episodes and decided that I didn't like it anymore.
4051000	4058000	But I want something where when the villagers piss me off, I can go in the house in the middle of the night and steal their stuff and sell it.
4058000	4061000	Like, I want a dark version of Animal Crossing.
4061000	4063000	Animal Crossing Underground.
4063000	4065000	Or something like that.
4065000	4067000	Or Animal Taking.
4067000	4071000	I want to be able to kidnap animals.
4071000	4073000	Alright, anyway.
4073000	4079000	Let's move on. Other virtual console news, I guess.
4079000	4081000	Anyways, so.
4081000	4087000	There's a brand new game coming out. It's almost like I made it or something, but it's not.
4087000	4089000	It's called Super Meat Boy.
4089000	4093000	And it's co-created by Edmund McMillen.
4093000	4097000	And apparently, I'm not really sure what it is.
4097000	4101000	I guess it's a Flash game.
4101000	4105000	Kind of similar to N+.
4105000	4111000	And it'll be coming out to the virtual console sometime soon, apparently.
4111000	4115000	But they have a little teaser site available for it now. Super Meat Boy dot com.
4115000	4117000	Meat Boy.
4117000	4121000	GS68 says Super Meatroid. Then I'd buy it.
4121000	4125000	Yeah, it's actually on Newgrounds. They have the Flash game, so you can check it out.
4125000	4133000	I guess it sounds sort of similar to, you know, Castle Crashers or something, but not.
4133000	4139000	What if, instead of calling it Super Meat Boy, they called it Super Bacon Boy?
4139000	4140000	This game would be the top-
4140000	4141000	It doesn't look like bacon.
4141000	4145000	It would be the top- Well, they need to go back and edit the sprites or something and make it Super Bacon Boy.
4145000	4149000	Because it would be the top-selling WiiWare game ever.
4149000	4154000	Like, even more than Strong Bad and all that stuff. Super Bacon Boy.
4154000	4158000	That was a big mistake, whoever made that decision to change bacon to meat.
4158000	4165000	But, uh, yeah. Apparently it's extremely hard.
4165000	4167000	Well, I guess it'll be a challenge then.
4167000	4170000	If you don't cut it, you don't cut it. Ha!
4170000	4173000	Rob, give me a pretzel.
4173000	4175000	Stop making bad jokes and I will.
4175000	4177000	Andrew's not here to do it for us.
4177000	4180000	No more free handouts, says GameTap.
4180000	4185000	And it happened on Thursday. They removed 97 games from the free lineup of games.
4185000	4191000	But look, in this economy and with the whole changing of the hands that went on over at GameTap, right?
4191000	4193000	Because Metabully bought them out or whatever.
4193000	4195000	Or I think they went up for sale and Metabully bought them.
4195000	4197000	You knew some changes were going to come.
4197000	4200000	That's two-thirds of the free games are gone.
4200000	4206000	Including some games like Art of Fighting, Baseball Stars Professional, Bust and Move Again.
4206000	4207000	Kicks!
4207000	4209000	Uh, yep. Kicks.
4209000	4211000	Tomb Raider Legends.
4211000	4214000	You know, Rainbow Islands.
4214000	4216000	So on and so on.
4216000	4218000	No more free handouts for you.
4218000	4222000	However, it should be pointed out, you can still play these games on GameTap.
4222000	4224000	You just have to pay for it.
4224000	4227000	You know what? This makes me even more not want to use our service.
4227000	4229000	Why?
4229000	4233000	I was actually considering, you know, signing up for GameTap.
4233000	4236000	And then, now there's no point.
4236000	4239000	Well the games are there, you just have to pay for them now.
4239000	4242000	I was going to pay for other games, but I don't want to play for shit I already own.
4242000	4245000	Which is damn near everything on that list.
4245000	4247000	At least the good ones.
4247000	4249000	You know?
4249000	4252000	You know, I'm going to be honest, I used to talk a lot about GameTap on the show,
4252000	4254000	but I did finally cancel my account a few months ago.
4254000	4256000	Just, you know, I just wasn't playing it enough.
4256000	4260000	But now that I'm not playing WoW, who knows? I might have to go back.
4260000	4261000	We'll see.
4261000	4264000	And plus, I was a little sad I couldn't play Missed Online anymore.
4264000	4267000	Even though it was weird, the game was very weird,
4267000	4270000	there was something about it that made me want to play it once in a while.
4270000	4272000	I have something there that you should play.
4272000	4274000	I found my DVD copy of Pissed.
4274000	4275000	Oh god.
4275000	4276000	It's the parody of Missed.
4276000	4278000	I've actually remembered that game.
4278000	4279000	Sadly.
4279000	4282000	Somewhere I've got Monty Python, it's a complete waste of time, but anyway.
4282000	4285000	Alright, I've got a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to our break tonight.
4285000	4290000	Well this next story is Lost Planet.
4290000	4292000	Oooh.
4292000	4294000	News on the sequel, finally?
4294000	4295000	News on the movie.
4295000	4299000	Oh, now this is what Capcom spent their whole E3 talking about, right?
4299000	4308000	They are saying that it's going to cost between 150 to 200 million dollars.
4308000	4315000	And that's just a crazy, crazy, crazy ass budget.
4315000	4320000	However, you know why it's going to be completely awesome?
4320000	4322000	It's written by David Hayter.
4322000	4323000	Aha.
4323000	4325000	The voice of Solid Snake.
4325000	4330000	But seriously, wasn't Titanic made for like 180 million dollars or something?
4330000	4333000	Like in that Pearl Harbor movie, was that it?
4333000	4336000	That cost like a shit ton of money to make?
4336000	4338000	It cost like 200 million dollars or something?
4338000	4340000	This one's written by David Hayter.
4340000	4345000	It's just, I understand that, but most movie goers have no idea who the fuck he is.
4345000	4348000	He might be like a prince in your cult or whatever.
4348000	4349000	The first X-Men movie.
4349000	4351000	Oh that's right he did, okay.
4351000	4353000	Fuck yeah he did, he was a good one.
4353000	4355000	I stand corrected, I stand corrected.
4355000	4357000	But still, that's a big budget.
4357000	4360000	That's a big risk.
4360000	4362000	Hope it pays off for him.
4362000	4365000	I hope so, because it's David Hayter.
4365000	4370000	And also it's directed by the guy who did Spider-Man.
4370000	4371000	Sam Raimi?
4371000	4374000	Uh, Avi Arad though.
4374000	4375000	I'm pretty sorry.
4375000	4376000	Produced, not directed.
4376000	4377000	Oh okay, I was going to say.
4377000	4378000	Whoa whoa whoa.
4378000	4379000	No.
4379000	4381000	Now we're talking Army of Darkness here.
4381000	4383000	No, I meant produced.
4383000	4385000	Alright, we'll see.
4385000	4388000	Sorry, I was checking out Super Meat Boy.
4388000	4389000	He was playing with his meat.
4389000	4390000	It's exactly like N+.
4390000	4391000	You were playing with your meat, Loki?
4391000	4393000	Yes, I was playing with my meat.
4393000	4395000	It's exactly like.
4395000	4396000	During the show?
4396000	4397000	Loki.
4397000	4398000	I know.
4398000	4400000	It's so unexpected of me.
4400000	4403000	Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.
4403000	4407000	There was an announcement made this week.
4407000	4411000	Remember everyone was saying, hey, what happened to the Indiana Jones game?
4411000	4417000	Well, that Indiana Jones game that they were showing us before, not coming out.
4417000	4418000	At least right now.
4418000	4422000	But there is a different Indiana Jones game which looks pretty cool.
4422000	4424000	It's Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings.
4424000	4428000	It's coming to the Wii and the DS this spring.
4428000	4435000	And they had a cool little trailer online that kind of showcased typical Indiana Jones-esque stuff.
4435000	4437000	So that's pretty cool.
4437000	4443000	Apparently, though, they said that it's also been rated for the PSP.
4443000	4450000	And possibly they're thinking PS2 because if it's coming to the PSP, you know, they'd pour a lot of games over to the PS2 anyways.
4450000	4455000	So, very, very cool.
4455000	4461000	Well, maybe that Lost Planet movie that Dark Sakura was talking about earlier will get nominated for an Oscar someday.
4461000	4465000	Hopefully, though, with a budget like that, it will not get nominated for a Razzie.
4465000	4470000	And if you've never heard of the Razzies, the Razzies are the things that happened the day before the Oscars.
4470000	4472000	And it's translated to this.
4472000	4476000	Exactly. Well, that's what it is, a Golden Raspberry Award.
4476000	4484000	And I think they literally dip something in like cheap gold plating or something and they value the award at like $5 or something like that.
4484000	4488000	Well, they give away these Razzie awards to the worst of the worst movies of the year.
4488000	4493000	And I think I read somewhere this year, The Love Guru got nominated for more Razzies than any other movie.
4493000	4497000	That was that Mike Myers movie that came out during the summer a lot of people did not like, right?
4497000	4502000	Well, somebody else that is going to be getting a Razzie, Uwe Boll.
4502000	4507000	That's right, Uwe Boll has been nominated in five categories this year.
4507000	4513000	Worst Picture for In the Name of the King, A Dungeon Siege Tale has been recognized as one of the worst films of the year.
4513000	4514000	It's been nominated there.
4514000	4521000	However, now he might win that, but it might, you know, Love Guru did get ten nominations, so it might beat it.
4521000	4523000	But here's the other thing you should recognize.
4523000	4526000	Uwe Boll has been guaranteed an award at the ceremony.
4526000	4532000	He is going to earn the Lifetime Recognition Award of Worst Career Achievement.
4534000	4536000	This is all the clap he earns.
4536000	4538000	Linda Blair has earned this award.
4538000	4541000	Erwin R. Allen earned this award.
4541000	4546000	And Ronald Reagan once earned this award as well, because remember, he was an actor before he did all that other stuff.
4546000	4555000	So, Uwe Boll is going to be getting a type of Lifetime Achievement Award from the Razzies for his shittatious films.
4556000	4557000	Awesome.
4557000	4562000	Congratulations to Uwe Boll for finally getting recognized with the Hollywood Movie Award.
4562000	4567000	Now he can say, but now, see, now he can say the award-winning Uwe Boll in his movies.
4567000	4568000	Yeah, he won shit.
4568000	4569000	There he goes.
4569000	4573000	They should just poop and dip it in gold and get it to them.
4573000	4574000	They just might.
4574000	4577000	But now the question is, will he show up to collect it in person?
4577000	4579000	Because some people have a sense of humor about it.
4579000	4588000	Very few people go to collect their awards in person, but Halle Berry actually showed up the year she won Worst Actress in Catwoman.
4588000	4594000	She actually showed up to collect the award in person and told off the people in the crowd, but in a joking way.
4594000	4600000	And that's cool that she recognized that the movie was shit and could kind of make fun of herself.
4600000	4602000	You guys have to kind of laugh at that.
4602000	4608000	And if I recall correctly, didn't Uwe Boll show up at Penny Arcade Expo in 07?
4608000	4612000	When they couldn't get Jack Thompson, they got Uwe Boll and he came out on stage.
4612000	4617000	I mean, with all the shit that guy gets, that takes guts.
4617000	4619000	He is a boxer.
4619000	4621000	YYR in our chatroom is convinced he will.
4621000	4622000	He will pick it up.
4622000	4624000	He loves to be in front of the camera.
4624000	4626000	We'll see.
4626000	4627000	And Tigerclaw actually links...
4627000	4628000	Media whore!
4628000	4630000	Apparently, he's already written a speech.
4630000	4640000	Tigerclaw has linked me to an article that apparently he already wrote some weird speech about,
4640000	4647000	I'm glad to be nominated as best supporting actor against stars like Ben Kingsley and Pierce Brosnan and so on and so on.
4647000	4649000	He's just deluded.
4649000	4652000	You all know that's not a good thing, right?
4652000	4655000	This isn't a word for you being bad.
4655000	4657000	Although I hope that wasn't Pierce Brosnan and Mamma Mia.
4657000	4661000	How dare they give Mamma Mia a Razzie nomination?
4661000	4662000	How dare they?
4662000	4665000	Oh, yeah, good grief.
4665000	4667000	I realize Pierce Brosnan was pretty shitty in that movie.
4667000	4669000	Why isn't that nominated for best picture, Rob?
4669000	4670000	That's what I'm wondering.
4670000	4671000	That's what I'm wondering.
4671000	4674000	Alright, anyhow.
4674000	4680000	This is the part of the show where we bestow our own honor upon a classic video game.
4680000	4682000	Can someone update our wiki?
4682000	4687000	That Dark Sakura has claimed worthy of being a part of her cult.
4687000	4692000	Although sometimes if the wiki is not updated, the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki, which is on our website,
4692000	4696000	she gets frightened that she might accidentally pick something that's been picked before.
4696000	4698000	But I believe this pick is brand new.
4698000	4700000	It is. That I know.
4700000	4705000	Alright, so here it is, your classic video game of the week, Dark Sakura.
4705000	4707000	What should the kids be playing this week?
4707000	4712000	The game of the week is Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
4712000	4718000	Which is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, if kind of dumb.
4718000	4721000	Gives it up a little bit, Rob. That's just an interview.
4721000	4725000	Did you hear music?
4727000	4729000	Okay.
4729000	4736000	Now, the Alex Kidd games were their own little fun dinky platformers.
4736000	4743000	Alex Kidd in Shinobi World was an attempt that Sega wanted to do to actually parody their own titles.
4743000	4746000	You know, how there was Parodius for Gradius.
4746000	4750000	And, you know, Kidd Dracula for the Castlevania series.
4750000	4755000	The game was originally going to be called, it was actually Shinobi Kid.
4755000	4760000	And it was just going to be a parody. You hear the music.
4760000	4768000	It's the music from Shinobi.
4768000	4771000	You hear? Anyway.
4771000	4776000	So, it was going to be just a cute little parody of Shinobi.
4776000	4782000	And it ended up becoming an Alex Kidd game.
4782000	4784000	So that they could perpetuate in series.
4784000	4788000	Keep in mind, this was before we had Sonic. This is Sega Master System era, y'all.
4788000	4792000	And, it was a little funny thing about it.
4792000	4795000	The first boss, do you see what he looks like, Rob?
4795000	4799000	He looks like Mario. His name is supposed to be Mario.
4799000	4801000	He does kind of look like Mario and he throws fireballs.
4801000	4803000	But he's wearing a samurai outfit.
4803000	4805000	And the more you jump on him, he shrinks.
4805000	4806000	How funny.
4806000	4809000	His name was Mario, which was supposed to be King Mari.
4809000	4812000	But they changed it to Kabuto.
4812000	4816000	But they were even going to do, like, a golden axe and a fantasy star.
4816000	4818000	And then we got Sonic.
4818000	4822000	But yeah, it's just a cute little platformer. You've got four stages in it.
4822000	4829000	Where you have the Kabuto stage, Raid of the Helicopters, the Jungle, and Battle with the Dark Ninja.
4829000	4834000	So, it's a pretty fun little game. I really always like playing this game.
4834000	4839000	This isn't an Alex Kidd game. Do you have to do those damn Janken fights?
4839000	4843000	Actually, Rob, I don't remember.
4843000	4847000	You want to know exactly how long it's been since I've played this game?
4847000	4849000	A while.
4849000	4852000	Um...
4852000	4854000	We'll say a while.
4854000	4863000	My freshman year of college, I traded all of my Nintendo systems for all of my friends' Sega systems.
4863000	4865000	For a week.
4865000	4870000	Just so I could see what the big deal was. That's when I developed my Sega love.
4870000	4874000	I had his power-based converter and played the shit out of this game.
4874000	4877000	And, um, Castle of Illusion.
4877000	4881000	Oh, the boss of this level looks kind of like the Oppa Oppa. I get what you're saying.
4881000	4882000	Yeah.
4882000	4884000	Oh, funny. Okay.
4884000	4887000	This is a big, fun parody game.
4887000	4894000	And I love the music. I just think it's great. And I really like- I really love a lot of the Sega Master System games.
4894000	4900000	I also love the American boxes for them, just because they're so shitty and generic.
4900000	4905000	They have, like, cute artwork, blah blah, grid background.
4905000	4909000	But yeah, this was an Alex Kidd game.
4909000	4917000	You know, I actually liked a lot of the other, though, Alex Kidd games, because there was the Alex Kidd Miracle World.
4917000	4923000	And, um, High Tech World. That was another one.
4923000	4926000	But this one is actually my favorite of the Alex Kidd games.
4926000	4932000	Alright, there you have it. Your classic game of the week. Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
4932000	4938000	A parody-rific game of some of Sega's great franchises.
4938000	4942000	That is gonna do it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.
4942000	4946000	We've got plenty more news to report on in Part B, so stick around, guys.
4946000	4948000	We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4948000	4953000	And hey, those of you that use Twitter, keep an eye out during this break. Show us your tweets.
4953000	4958000	We'll read some of your responses when we come back after this little break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4958000	4971000	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 25th of 2009.
4971000	4975000	With our 310th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4975000	4977000	These numbers are getting so high, it's just obscene.
4977000	4980000	And yes, that's starting with one. We've been doing this a little while.
4980000	4983000	Anyhow, show us your tweets.
4983000	4988000	We asked on Twitter during the break, what should Rob do now that he left World of Warcraft?
4988000	4990000	And during the break, you guys responded.
4990000	4993000	GS68 says, get Castle Crashers.
4993000	4998000	ActDev says, update the podcast in time. That or play more games on Xbox Live Arcade.
4998000	5003000	Jeni702 says, Rob should spend his leftover WoW subscription money on a super huge sandwich with bacon.
5003000	5006000	Om nom nom nom. That's actually a very good idea.
5006000	5010000	HarryAKA says, he should check himself into rehab before he relapses.
5010000	5015000	MistyOLR says, I don't know, work on the OLR shirts so I can do some pimping during Hey Sen.
5015000	5017000	That's a good idea.
5017000	5022000	ZakuPilot256 says, Rob should seek addiction counseling to prevent a relapse.
5022000	5026000	BlueSwim says, Rob should play kick the ferret with, of course, the ferret.
5026000	5029000	Just joking, DarkSakura. I heart the ferret.
5029000	5037000	XLink777 says, start a new drug habit or tossing a few tacos at people that don't like Abba.
5037000	5043000	I love it when we get last week's jokes incorporated into the show.
5043000	5045000	Oh, DarkSakura, I wish you were here for that story.
5045000	5051000	Some kid threw a taco at his mom over a video game.
5051000	5053000	And he got sent to jail.
5053000	5056000	The mom called the police. The kid went to jail.
5056000	5058000	That's fucking stupid.
5058000	5061000	What a way to teach him a lesson, though.
5061000	5064000	GioVedea says, doing anything is better than playing WoW.
5064000	5067000	DarkTetsuya says, start the cult with DarkSakura.
5067000	5070000	DJ Tyrant says, play Persona 3 and 4.
5070000	5075000	Had no idea Rob left because I'm playing WoW right now.
5075000	5080000	SchmittyDog says, Rob should either create an Abba tribute band or work on his musical career.
5080000	5082000	Have you heard me sing?
5082000	5089000	Crowzee says, he should make a WoW theme level on LittleBigPlanet and hope it doesn't get taken down by moderation.
5089000	5095000	There actually was a WoW theme level on LittleBigPlanet and it was actually kind of funny.
5095000	5099000	Biohaze20, the last one I'm going to read here, says, wait until something better is out.
5099000	5100000	Who knows when?
5100000	5102000	Who knows when?
5102000	5106000	Perhaps it will be one of these games we're going to talk about in this next segment in some of the news.
5106000	5108000	Is it a game you're going to talk about, Loki?
5108000	5111000	Do you have the game I should be playing instead of WoW?
5111000	5112000	I don't know.
5112000	5116000	Apparently it's a brand new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles brawler.
5116000	5117000	Never mind.
5117000	5121000	That was originally revealed last month.
5121000	5125000	I can't believe they're titling it this, but yes.
5125000	5134000	Apparently trying to capitalize on the popularity of Super Smash Brothers, it's officially titled TMNT Smash Up.
5134000	5138000	Yes, that is clever, Ubisoft.
5138000	5140000	Way to go.
5140000	5151000	Apparently it's going to feature arenas that will change throughout the battles as you might remember something similar to Power Stone 2.
5151000	5154000	Or even Smash Brothers, I guess.
5154000	5164000	You'll see players defeating their opponents either by knocking them off the stage or by emptying their health meter entirely, which can be filled with pizza.
5164000	5169000	Wow, if this does not sound like a ripoff of Smash Brothers.
5169000	5171000	I'll still play it. It's Turtles.
5171000	5174000	But it says apparently this is targeted for the Wii.
5174000	5182000	It says there will be no motion controlled attacks, though Waggle isn't ruled out for other aspects or context since the moves and stuff.
5182000	5188000	It's described as dark and gritty as far as the graphic style.
5188000	5195000	And I guess Turtles co-creator Peter Laird is penning the single story or single player story.
5195000	5203000	And currently, as far as the roster goes, Ninja Turtles and Splinter are confirmed.
5203000	5208000	Alright, whatever.
5208000	5211000	I don't know, it's neat.
5211000	5214000	I don't know, I'm a little apprehensive about these types of games.
5214000	5215000	Turtles!
5215000	5220000	It'll never be as good as it was right when the arcade game and the original NES game were out.
5220000	5221000	It's just not.
5221000	5223000	The original NES game was not good.
5223000	5224000	The NES game blew.
5224000	5227000	Yeah, okay, but at least it had a good soundtrack.
5227000	5229000	But the arcade game was the best.
5229000	5234000	The best home version of any teenage mutant Ninja Turtles game was Turtles in Time.
5234000	5236000	End of story.
5236000	5238000	That was pretty good. I'll give it to you.
5238000	5240000	It was perfect.
5240000	5244000	Alright, this might be perfect.
5244000	5248000	I don't know if there's a space for Rob Halford in your cult, Dark Sakura.
5248000	5253000	If you forgot, Rob Halford is the frontman of the band Judas Priest.
5253000	5257000	And he has copyrighted a new video game title.
5257000	5259000	It's called Metal God.
5259000	5262000	And this was discovered, a trademark that was filed on January 11th.
5262000	5266000	It covers computer games, video games, and game controllers for computer games.
5266000	5270000	Huh, Guitar Hero ripoff?
5270000	5273000	But just would like Death Metal songs? Who knows.
5273000	5276000	Death Metal Hero? Sounds good to me.
5276000	5278000	Actually, this could be kind of cool.
5278000	5283000	But honestly, if you're going to put out a Metal God game, I have one thing to tell you.
5283000	5286000	GWAR or GTFO.
5286000	5289000	That's all I have to say about Metal God. GWAR or GTFO.
5289000	5292000	You can get GWAR outfits in Rock Band.
5292000	5296000	That is kind of cool, but it's not the same thing as actually playing GWAR.
5296000	5297000	True.
5297000	5301000	So, GWAR or GTFO. I hope you're listening, Rob Halford.
5305000	5307000	I say that like he actually is.
5307000	5308000	I don't know.
5308000	5311000	We know you're an avid fan of our show.
5311000	5314000	A Death Metal game could be kind of fun, actually.
5314000	5316000	I don't know.
5316000	5318000	It's funny, though, because Robert M.
5318000	5319000	Good point, Robert M.
5319000	5322000	Robert M. points out, first trailer for Guitar Hero Metallica said,
5322000	5325000	Unleash your Metal God.
5325000	5327000	Interesting.
5327000	5329000	And Robert M. goes, coincidence?
5329000	5331000	Good catch. I didn't even catch onto that.
5331000	5333000	We'll see. We will see.
5333000	5335000	Halo!
5335000	5336000	What about it?
5336000	5338000	Is that a band? Is that a GWAR song?
5338000	5340000	Halo Wars, Rob.
5340000	5341000	What about it?
5341000	5347000	There is going to be a demo for Halo Wars on February 5th,
5347000	5354000	and it's going to have a beginner and advanced tutorial
5354000	5358000	so that you can learn how to play the game.
5358000	5362000	And you can just say, Fuck the tutorial! I'm gonna play!
5362000	5364000	Also known as Loki Mode.
5364000	5366000	Is that Loki Mode?
5366000	5368000	F the tutorial sometimes.
5368000	5373000	Like Mirror's Edge, because I can't remember what I'm supposed to be doing in that.
5373000	5375000	Mirror's Edge is hard.
5375000	5378000	You can also play through the first two missions from the story mode.
5378000	5384000	The demo includes one of the multiplayer maps, Chasms,
5384000	5389000	and you can play it in skirmish mode against an AI,
5389000	5395000	or you can play as a covenant in that game.
5395000	5400000	It's supposed to be out in Europe on February 27th with a limited edition.
5400000	5402000	We'll have the mythic map pack.
5402000	5406000	And I don't know when the US version is to be out.
5406000	5407000	March 3rd.
5407000	5408000	March 3rd. Okay.
5408000	5410000	I'm like a frickin' encyclopeo at the games.
5410000	5412000	I swear to God, I don't like...
5412000	5415000	Hey, it makes you great on the show!
5415000	5420000	I also don't know if that beta date is for us or for the UK,
5420000	5422000	but it's definitely for the UK.
5422000	5424000	I just don't know if it applies to us as well.
5424000	5426000	I'm pretty sure it's a worldwide thing.
5426000	5428000	It's the fifth for us, yeah.
5428000	5429000	It's a demo.
5429000	5431000	I'll check it out!
5431000	5433000	I own all the Halo games.
5433000	5437000	They're better, better, better, better, better,
5437000	5442000	be a Red vs. Blue introduction or something in it with Sarge.
5442000	5445000	Do you want a reference somewhere in the game?
5445000	5448000	We'll see. Maybe a unit. We'll see.
5448000	5452000	I do vote that they should have a new downloadable campaign that's Red vs. Blue,
5452000	5454000	because that would be awesome.
5454000	5456000	Just like they're doing with the ODST stuff,
5456000	5460000	but it just has a download campaign.
5460000	5463000	Talking about video game inspired fan tributes,
5463000	5465000	I don't remember if I mentioned this on the show.
5465000	5467000	I think I mentioned this before we went live,
5467000	5469000	but something, believe it or not, I finally saw for the first time,
5469000	5471000	ironically, the day I quit WoW,
5471000	5473000	was the Guild.
5473000	5474000	I don't know if you've ever seen this.
5474000	5477000	It's this YouTube thing that kind of parodies the whole world of Warcraft.
5477000	5480000	I only saw the first little four-minute episode,
5480000	5482000	but it's hilarious.
5482000	5484000	And I just want to tell you, people aren't that bad.
5484000	5485000	Actually, some people are that bad,
5485000	5487000	but I was never that bad,
5487000	5489000	if you've seen the Guild.
5489000	5491000	And that Felicia Day, she is very cute.
5491000	5493000	She's quite cute.
5493000	5497000	I've heard of her, and I know people loved her at PAX and all that stuff,
5497000	5499000	but I'd never really seen her before.
5499000	5501000	She was quite cute.
5501000	5503000	No, I did not see Dr. Horrible yet.
5503000	5505000	I was too busy playing WoW.
5505000	5507000	You need to watch it!
5507000	5508000	I'll check it out!
5508000	5509000	To go back to what I was talking about,
5509000	5511000	about the TMNT fighter thing,
5511000	5514000	I forgot when we mentioned this the first time.
5514000	5520000	It's actually being put together by some of the ex-Brawl team,
5520000	5522000	which is probably why it's a little bit like Brawl,
5522000	5524000	and Team Ninja.
5524000	5525000	Oh, interesting.
5525000	5526000	So if it's by Team Ninja,
5526000	5530000	does that mean we're going to get April O'Neil with ginormous tits?
5530000	5535000	I was thinking the exact same thing.
5535000	5540000	I'm being yelled at by chat for never seeing Dr. Horrible.
5540000	5542000	I'll see it eventually.
5542000	5544000	Eventually.
5544000	5547000	Three parts, Rob!
5547000	5548000	All right.
5548000	5549000	Three!
5549000	5550000	I'll watch it!
5550000	5552000	Eventually.
5552000	5558000	Mini Ninjas, this is a game that's being put out by IO Interactive.
5558000	5564000	You may remember them of putting out such games as the Hitman franchise,
5564000	5568000	or I think they did maybe Kane & Lynch as well.
5568000	5571000	This has actually been rated by the ESRB.
5571000	5572000	It's E10+.
5572000	5574000	It's kind of a cute action game.
5574000	5579000	I also talked about it about a year ago from last spring.
5579000	5582000	Unfortunately, no one remembers that.
5582000	5584000	Looks pretty awesome from what I remember,
5584000	5586000	and they do have a video online for it.
5586000	5590000	It's got cute pandas and dogs and stuff in it,
5590000	5594000	but it's an action game.
5594000	5597000	It's that broad family appeal type stuff.
5597000	5600000	And who doesn't like Mini Ninjas?
5600000	5601000	Now, I don't know.
5601000	5605000	I guess Mini Ninja sounds better than Big Fat Ass Ninja.
5605000	5608000	Well, it's also better than...
5608000	5613000	God, what the hell is that crappy movie franchise?
5613000	5614000	Three Ninjas.
5614000	5617000	Yeah, it's better than Three Ninjas.
5617000	5620000	Or Pocket Ninjas, because that movie also sucked.
5620000	5621000	Or Little Ninjas.
5621000	5623000	Isn't that also a Three Ninjas type movie?
5623000	5624000	Yes.
5624000	5626000	Oh god, I remember watching that.
5626000	5628000	It was so horrible.
5628000	5630000	What was the...
5630000	5633000	He called the guy a...
5633000	5636000	Don't make me go back to that place, Loki.
5636000	5642000	What was that, the Dollar Tree video thing?
5642000	5645000	Never buy a video for a dollar, because you get what you pay for.
5645000	5648000	Well, here's something you can buy relatively cheap.
5648000	5649000	Crystal Defenders.
5649000	5651000	This is a game put out by Squeenix.
5651000	5652000	It's a mobile and iPod game.
5652000	5655000	It's about defending towers, basically.
5655000	5657000	It's actually going to be coming out for consoles,
5657000	5658000	according to Fumitsu Magazine.
5658000	5660000	They're going to put it out on WiiWare.
5660000	5662000	It's called Crystal Defenders R1.
5662000	5664000	It's going to have Wi-Fi connection support in it,
5664000	5666000	and I'm not sure exactly what that means.
5666000	5667000	If that means it's going to be Internet,
5667000	5669000	or some type of functionality with a DS, or what have you.
5669000	5671000	It's coming out in Japan on January 27th.
5671000	5672000	Hey, that's this week.
5672000	5676000	1,000 Wii Points is what it's going to cost you.
5676000	5680000	Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network versions are in development.
5680000	5683000	They're going to be updated versions of the original game,
5683000	5685000	but are much further out in the future,
5685000	5687000	as they have no price or release date.
5687000	5689000	So, if you are a Squeenix fan,
5689000	5691000	specifically Crystal Defenders,
5691000	5692000	or are curious in checking this out,
5692000	5694000	it's going to get a lot easier for you,
5694000	5698000	especially if you don't really like to play games on your telephone.
5698000	5701000	Well, we know DarkSakura likes to play games on her telephone.
5701000	5702000	During the show.
5702000	5704000	During the show, but at some point,
5704000	5706000	she's going to have to stop playing games during the show,
5706000	5709000	and answer your emails at our mailbag.
5709000	5711000	Every week, we invite you to send us emails
5711000	5713000	at mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.
5713000	5714000	We pick a few of our favorites,
5714000	5716000	and read them for you right here on the air,
5716000	5717000	and respond to them.
5717000	5723000	So, DarkSakura, open up the mailbag.
5723000	5724000	Send us some mail.
5724000	5725000	Just three.
5725000	5726000	Alrighty.
5726000	5728000	Hi, Orange Lounge Radio.
5728000	5729000	Hi!
5729000	5731000	I'm a late comer to this podcast,
5731000	5735000	and I found out while browsing various podcasts on the Zune Marketplace.
5735000	5736000	Hey.
5736000	5739000	Well, thank you, Zune Marketplace, for the plug.
5739000	5741000	I'm glad I've stumbled onto it,
5741000	5743000	as it's a very entertaining podcast.
5743000	5745000	Greeting aside, I've decided to email the mailbag
5745000	5748000	in response to Skye's interest in Left 4 Dead.
5748000	5751000	I can say Left 4 Dead is much like Mario Party,
5751000	5754000	in that it's best played with best friends,
5754000	5756000	and not by yourself.
5756000	5758000	You shouldn't worry too much about it being horror,
5758000	5763000	even though my most cowardly horror movie loathing friends enjoy Left 4 Dead.
5763000	5767000	This is mainly because Left 4 Dead is less a survival horror game,
5767000	5770000	and first person shooter, as it is a party game.
5770000	5773000	I explained it to one of my friends best when I said Left 4 Dead
5773000	5775000	was pretty much rock band with the undead.
5775000	5777000	Listener, Ross.
5777000	5780000	P.S. I've decided to join your Steam community group,
5780000	5784000	but are there only 19 people in it?
5784000	5787000	I know there's got to be more listeners than that.
5787000	5789000	Maybe a little encouragement from the show?
5789000	5791000	Join it!
5791000	5793000	I don't even remember where the Steam community's at.
5793000	5794000	I know it's going to sound horrible.
5794000	5796000	I don't even know if I'm in it.
5796000	5799000	I don't think I am, so I'm going to have to look it up.
5799000	5802000	I didn't even know we had a Steam community.
5802000	5805000	It must have come up like once in a show a long time ago,
5805000	5808000	like when I first got Steam, and probably because I never used it,
5808000	5811000	it lost Steam.
5811000	5814000	But I will check it out, and I want to get Left 4 Dead,
5814000	5817000	and another game I've been eyeing getting on Steam is Mirror's Edge,
5817000	5820000	because I kind of want to check that out.
5820000	5823000	For some reason, I'm feeling like playing it on the PC as opposed to a console.
5823000	5825000	So we'll see.
5825000	5827000	I will check out Left 4 Dead, though.
5827000	5830000	Yeah, go find the Orange Mountains Radio Steam community,
5830000	5832000	and I'll plug it next week on the show, and then I'll play it,
5832000	5834000	and then I can play with listeners,
5834000	5836000	because I don't know a lot of people that play PC games.
5836000	5838000	So I'm sure there's a...
5838000	5840000	There you go.
5840000	5841000	We'll see.
5841000	5843000	Next email, dun dun dun.
5843000	5845000	Actually, I got two emails from the same person,
5845000	5848000	and one is a continuation, so let's just go for it.
5848000	5849000	Okay.
5849000	5852000	To start with, my brother just won a PlayStation 3 at work.
5852000	5854000	Let me reiterate.
5854000	5857000	My brother won a frequent PlayStation 3 at work,
5857000	5859000	an 80 gig model specifically.
5859000	5862000	He's gotten GTA V prologue, he's getting GTA IV,
5862000	5864000	and getting, um,
5864000	5867000	and my getting little big planet, ArtGivens.
5867000	5870000	I'm pretty sure he wouldn't care for SingStar, though.
5870000	5872000	We already have Rock Band 2 for the Wii,
5872000	5875000	and as well as a dedicated karaoke machine.
5875000	5877000	And yes, I really like Rock Band 2,
5877000	5881000	even though I may have to get more SD cards for downloadable content.
5881000	5884000	Getting the game for the PS3 wasn't in my mind at the time,
5884000	5886000	since nobody expected him to win the console,
5886000	5889000	plus getting all the instruments again for a new system
5889000	5893000	rather than using the Guitar Hero instruments would be prohibitively expensive.
5893000	5894000	True dat.
5894000	5900000	My Guitar Hero World Tour somehow got the cymbal wires cut slash torn.
5900000	5902000	Probably it's having a sensitivity issue,
5902000	5907000	so I've gone ahead and replaced it with the Wii RB1 drum kit.
5907000	5911000	Um, soon we'll see third-party drum kits for all the systems
5911000	5919000	as common as third, um, as third-party is, um, as common as third-party guitar controllers.
5919000	5924000	Um, also, dude, you could actually solder the wires, too, and fix it.
5924000	5928000	Um, anyway, I haven't seen, um, I have Saints Row 2
5928000	5931000	and the ported form of Orange Box on my Gamefly list.
5931000	5933000	I have to see what else to look into.
5933000	5935000	My brother's a subscriber of Netflix,
5935000	5939000	and will be changing most of his rental list to Blu-ray versions of the movies.
5939000	5942000	Is the PS3 Netflix streaming currently available?
5942000	5944000	Um, Xbox 360.
5944000	5946000	Yeah, it's only on Xbox 360.
5946000	5954000	Or, um, well, I don't think you can, using your PC, you might...
5954000	5956000	No, you can watch movies on your PC.
5956000	5963000	Well, I know that, but I'm not sure if you can use it, like, the Netflix on PC as a media, um, media server
5963000	5964000	and then stream it to your...
5964000	5967000	No, I think it uses its own applications. I don't think you can do that.
5967000	5972000	Yeah, they do have an application out there that will actually stream whatever's on your PC monitor.
5972000	5980000	So, using that, then yes, you could probably stream Netflix, but that, you know, you'd have to find that first.
5982000	5984000	So, there you go.
5985000	5986000	Any more emails?
5986000	5988000	There's... I haven't even done Rob.
5988000	5989000	Oh, sorry!
5989000	5992000	I didn't conclude this one, Rob.
5992000	5997000	And just for the heck of asking, will the TV tuner units for the PSP and DS,
5997000	6002000	although generally not readily available in the United States, become obsolete with the digital transition?
6002000	6003000	Probably.
6003000	6004000	What a good question.
6004000	6009000	Well, I'm not sure. Well, obviously not in Japan, because, you know, they're not switching over there.
6009000	6011000	I mean, that's only in the US.
6011000	6013000	So, um...
6014000	6016000	I would think yes, they're going to be obsolete.
6016000	6021000	If they're using the same type of technology, if they're not receiving digital TV signals,
6021000	6023000	which I doubt they are, then it's not going to work.
6023000	6028000	The TV tuners for the DS and stuff over there work with their network.
6028000	6031000	It's not the same as ours over here.
6031000	6035000	You can't tune in our stations with that TV tuner, basically.
6036000	6039000	So, you wouldn't be able to use them anyways.
6039000	6040000	I guess it depends how it works.
6040000	6044000	If it's basically hooking up rabbit ears to your DS, then it's not going to work.
6044000	6046000	But if it's somehow feeding...
6046000	6051000	Because I thought it was a digital streaming service over there. Was it one seg or something like that?
6051000	6052000	I don't know.
6052000	6054000	But I know it's not compatible over here.
6054000	6060000	That's why they haven't brought it out over here, because, you know, you can't use it on our network.
6060000	6065000	Not that I don't think that many people would be interested in streaming or watching live TV.
6065000	6067000	I don't know. I guess it could be useful.
6067000	6070000	Well, to conclude the email...
6070000	6073000	By the way, it was from Robert M., by the way. Just saying.
6073000	6076000	The second portion that was sent says,
6076000	6082000	As if my last email wasn't long enough, since I found them for $20, I went ahead and purchased the orange box.
6082000	6083000	Good choice.
6083000	6086000	Burnout Paradise as well as LittleBigPlanet.
6086000	6088000	Hopefully my brother can invest in a second controller.
6088000	6091000	I'm replacing OrangeBox with Fallout 3.
6091000	6094000	He found LittleBigPlanet for $20? That's a hell of a find.
6094000	6095000	I'd say so.
6095000	6096000	Good for you.
6096000	6098000	Unless he just means that he just purchased it.
6098000	6099000	I think the other two were $20.
6099000	6105000	OrangeBox and Burnout Paradise would most likely be in the less expensive range.
6105000	6107000	That's it.
6107000	6108000	Those are some good choices though.
6108000	6109000	It's over!
6109000	6110000	That's it? For emails?
6110000	6111000	Yes.
6111000	6112000	What a weak selection.
6112000	6115000	No offense to the people that did email us, but we didn't get a lot of emails.
6115000	6119000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email.
6119000	6127000	Well, speaking of Burnout Paradise, you're going to be able to play a lot more things in it soon.
6127000	6131000	Of course, I'm talking about some updates that are coming out.
6131000	6133000	They're going to have the Party Pack DLC.
6133000	6137000	Remember, originally they were going to have the Burnout Ultimate Party Box.
6137000	6139000	That was going to be coming out.
6139000	6145000	Actually, in the US, it's only coming out now as download content unless you buy the PC version.
6145000	6148000	The UK, though, is getting their own releases for that.
6148000	6159000	On February 6th, though, we will be getting the update along with the Party Pack download content, which will be charging that.
6159000	6162000	Lots of new stuff.
6162000	6170000	Of course, they're going to be adding some new trophies and other enhanced visuals and stuff.
6170000	6173000	In fact, the list of stuff that they're doing here...
6173000	6183000	They're going to have an in-game store, which is kind of cool, so you'll be able to browse while connected to the Criterion Games network.
6183000	6187000	And you'll be able to see all the game updates and purchases and stuff like that.
6187000	6193000	Tweaked vehicle handling. Earlier cars are now tweaked to be easier for newcomers to use.
6193000	6198000	And these cars are now slower, harder to crash, and less likely to spin out at low speeds.
6198000	6205000	Junkyard sorting. You'll be able to compare the stats of the cars and you'll be able to filter out cars and bikes.
6205000	6208000	Upcoming download content vehicles.
6208000	6214000	Stunt run timer change. They have a different timer now that starts much slower than before.
6214000	6218000	Allows beginners more wiggle room to start a combo.
6218000	6226000	Let's see here. They've rebalanced the events. All events have been modified to accommodate the new car speeds.
6226000	6234000	They have road rage tweaked a bit. Players are no longer able to get additional time once they've reached the target score.
6234000	6245000	Let's see here. Enhanced visuals. They're going to be fixing some of the in-game billboards and smashes.
6245000	6251000	Stuff's easier to spot. Lighting's been tweaked to make it more vibrant and easier to drive at night.
6251000	6259000	They have a new restart function so if you fuck up during a race you can restart it which is nice instead of having to just drive all the way back to the starting point.
6259000	6266000	And then easier barrel rolls. And barrel rolls are now automatic.
6266000	6269000	That's a lot of stuff.
6269000	6281000	And then of course the upcoming premium download content. The party, toy cars, and legendary cars I think are all coming out on the 6th.
6281000	6287000	That would be cool. And new trophies of course tying in with that download content.
6287000	6298000	Awesome. I love it. They have one that's sound the horn on the silver lake super jump in the Calvary bootlegger.
6298000	6302000	Cause that was the, you know, generally.
6302000	6310000	I know I love how they have all their cute little new names for the vehicles. I thought that was especially cute how they get around the copyright there or what have you.
6310000	6320000	Well speaking of download content, some very very highly anticipated download content probably by our very own Loki is the Lost and the Damned.
6320000	6329000	That is the official name for the new downloadable expansion for Grand Theft Auto 4 that is coming out on the Xbox 360 and only the Xbox 360.
6329000	6335000	The Lost and the Damned is coming out February 17th. That's right we finally have a release date. February 17th.
6335000	6341000	As far as how much it's going to set you back, 1600 Microsoft points. That's 20 bucks.
6341000	6350000	Apparently though it will be about 10-20 hours of new gameplay, new missions, new music, new weapons, and apparently membership to a biker gang.
6350000	6357000	One thing apparently that's not in it though is the voice actor who originally did Nico's voice in Grand Theft Auto 4.
6357000	6362000	I remember reading a story about that as well this week. Apparently just cost too damn much money for him to come back.
6362000	6369000	Well he was saying that he wanted more money or should have asked for more money and he's not coming back because of that.
6369000	6375000	The other thing that kind of sucks too is that Lost and Damned download content is basically it's own game.
6375000	6380000	So when you download that you don't get new weapons in like say the normal Grand Theft Auto game and stuff.
6380000	6385000	Because they say it just doesn't make sense that Nico would have access to grenade launcher or something like that.
6385000	6390000	I say fuck that. Who gives a shit about continuity? I mean I want my damn tanks and stuff.
6390000	6394000	But yeah I will have to download this because it looks pretty awesome.
6394000	6400000	But it's not something that's going to be fluid with the original game. It's like really a separate game.
6400000	6405000	Well they're going to have a portion that kind of crosses over with Nico.
6405000	6410000	But it's very brief. I mean like he's in it for just a second during a cutscene.
6410000	6415000	Because they're going to have to copy paste his voice acting from before if the guy's not coming back or get a guy to impersonate him.
6415000	6424000	Yeah which is kind of lame. I think they should just put out a pack later that's just over the top stuff like bring back the flamethrower.
6424000	6428000	They were going to have the flamethrower in this game and they cut it out. It's lame.
6428000	6433000	Bring back the flamethrower, the minigun, the tanks. Just go crazy with it.
6433000	6435000	And the Animal Crossing village.
6435000	6442000	And they should bring zombies in there. Like have it where you defend Liberty City against a zombie attack or something.
6442000	6447000	Totally rip off, you know, was it 28 days later or something like that.
6447000	6456000	Alright, well we will see what ends up happening with this new download content when it is released in February.
6456000	6459000	I'm sure the internet will be all over it. We'll see.
6459000	6462000	I'll tell you something else the internet's all over.
6462000	6464000	Porn!
6464000	6468000	I'm kidding. I just like throwing crack.
6468000	6474000	No, Mega Man! Star Force 3 actually.
6474000	6480000	Mega Man is actually going to be in two Nintendo DS titles.
6480000	6483000	There's going, and it's in the Star Force series.
6483000	6490000	There's Mega Man, Star Force 3, Red Joker, and Black Ace.
6490000	6492000	Which actually looks pretty cool.
6492000	6496000	I actually haven't played any of the Star Force games before.
6496000	6502000	But it's sort of an action RPG with what they call noise changes.
6502000	6509000	So you can actually use 100 different noises to combine that changes Mega Man's look in the game.
6509000	6515000	And also changes his abilities based off of earth, wind, air, and fire.
6515000	6518000	Fire being the greatest of all time of course.
6518000	6522000	And you can trade noises with other Nintendo Wi-Fi players.
6522000	6524000	So it's supposed to be out in the summer.
6524000	6525000	It looks sweet!
6525000	6528000	Yeah, I don't know.
6528000	6531000	I want more side scrolling Mega Man. At least we got Mega Man 9.
6531000	6533000	It's a little hard to complain.
6533000	6535000	Why can't that be ported to DS is what I want.
6535000	6536000	There you go.
6536000	6538000	Just make Mega Man 10.
6538000	6540000	But make it easier for dumb-dumbs like me.
6540000	6544000	No, keep it hard. It gives you a sense of accomplishment.
6544000	6546000	Yeah.
6546000	6551000	Well, you know there's a game that's coming out, or I should say it's not coming out.
6551000	6554000	It's a mature game by the name of Winter.
6554000	6560000	It was being put out by the team N-Space.
6560000	6567000	Basically they were behind the GameCube game Geist, which was kind of not that successful.
6567000	6573000	Apparently they ran into a problem though with their sales and marketing groups.
6573000	6579000	Apparently the game, they could not get behind a survivor horror title on the Wii.
6579000	6587000	And in spite of great sales like on the Resident Evil 4 and Umbrella Chronicles and stuff that's similar to this,
6587000	6593000	they didn't get the green light to basically make this game, which is lame.
6593000	6597000	But the game itself, very much like Silent Hill.
6597000	6604000	If you exchange the fog in Silent Hill for snow, you basically have Winter right there.
6604000	6610000	So I think they should sell the engine off to Konami to make another Silent Hill game on the Wii.
6610000	6616000	Because it looked like it was basically Silent Hill 2, just now, you know, on the Wii.
6616000	6621000	That sucks, you know, a somewhat serious looking survival horror game and they don't want to do it.
6621000	6623000	But yet they'll remake Resident Evil 4.
6623000	6628000	It seriously was so much of a rip-off of Silent Hill, it's not even funny.
6628000	6635000	You could have called it Silent Hill and people went, oh my god, Silent Hill, you know, that close.
6635000	6638000	So what about Silent Snow?
6638000	6641000	Is this game just going to slip into obscurity forever?
6641000	6643000	Do you think it's possible this game could show up?
6643000	6645000	It could come back, you never know.
6645000	6648000	I mean, they're going to have, was it The Lost Mountain or something like that,
6648000	6653000	I think is one of the survival horror games coming out on the Wii.
6653000	6657000	And there's some other ones, I mean Sadness, whenever the hell that actually comes out.
6657000	6659000	Didn't Sadness end up getting cancelled or something?
6659000	6663000	No, I don't think it's still being worked on.
6663000	6666000	That game looked pretty amazing and then just kind of disappeared.
6666000	6674000	Yeah, it may come back later if they start doing more games that are like adult on the Wii
6674000	6676000	and they end up being successful.
6676000	6680000	Because they can say, hey, you know, maybe we should put out this game.
6680000	6684000	Because if you look at some of the games, like for example, Too Human,
6684000	6689000	that thing was in development since the Nintendo 64 having Cameo.
6689000	6695000	Those weren't exactly great games, but still, it could come out later on.
6695000	6699000	Just because it's not coming out now, if they don't find that it's appropriate,
6699000	6703000	they can just shelve it and go back to it later or something.
6703000	6710000	Alright. Well, another game that you may not get to play, at least very easily, is Dawn of War 2.
6710000	6716000	And this is Warhammer 40,000, so obviously there's several Warhammer series fans out there.
6716000	6719000	What's kind of interesting about this, now of course you can get the game,
6719000	6721000	but you're not going to be able to get it at GameStop.
6721000	6724000	And there's an interesting little tug of war going on here.
6724000	6729000	The rumor is it has to do with the game's association with Steam.
6729000	6734000	Apparently, on January 15th, GameStop, they were taking pre-orders for Dawn of War 2.
6734000	6738000	It's going to be a strategy game, by the way, if you have no idea what type of game we're talking about here.
6738000	6740000	And then suddenly it just disappeared.
6740000	6744000	GameStop.com is no longer offering the game.
6744000	6750000	If you call a GameStop store, they will tell you that Dawn of War 2, you can't pre-order this game.
6750000	6755000	But apparently, previously, you were able to get a chapter command war gear set
6755000	6757000	if you pre-ordered the game through GameStop.
6757000	6759000	So what the hell's going on?
6759000	6763000	The game didn't get cancelled. In fact, they just mentioned that the game went gold.
6763000	6769000	THQ is behind the game, and they actually bumped up the release date.
6769000	6773000	So apparently, though, something's going on with Steam.
6773000	6779000	The game is requiring you to install Steam, and of course, Steam being the way that you can get games online.
6779000	6782000	Apparently, GameStop corporate not happy with this.
6782000	6786000	But the weird thing is, don't Valve games make you install Steam too?
6786000	6788000	Yeah, because it's Valve's programming.
6788000	6793000	But yet they carry those games. GameStop will carry Orange Box and those type of games.
6793000	6795000	Hmm.
6795000	6798000	However, GameStop is kind of pissed.
6798000	6803000	Well, a lot of this is kind of rumor, or what have you, but it would make sense
6803000	6810000	because GameStop does not like it when digital distribution occurs before the game is released in retail.
6810000	6813000	And this kind of goes back to when Penny Arcade Adventures came out.
6813000	6819000	Yeah, but I have to ask, why do they even care? Because they don't really give a shit about PC titles.
6819000	6824000	Because if you've seen their PC selection, it's like a shelf. I mean, seriously, who gives a crap?
6824000	6826000	I don't know, maybe it's the principle of the thing.
6826000	6834000	It's like, oh, you're really cutting into our PC sales, which are, like, very small anyways. Who cares?
6834000	6844000	Anyway, take this news with a little bit of, you know, caution, because it's not necessarily, you know, it could be some very strange misunderstanding,
6844000	6851000	but a lot of people are reading into that the game is just not available.
6851000	6859000	Because I don't understand why they wouldn't carry a game, because, I mean, that's potential for people to trade in other things that they make a high margin off of,
6859000	6861000	you know, to buy said game.
6861000	6866000	I mean, hell, they're doing it now, I mean, it's so ridiculous, they're doing it now with download content cards.
6866000	6872000	Oh, I'm gonna trade in some games to get a card to go download something off of Xbox Live Arcade?
6872000	6878000	I mean, like, or, you know, The Lost and Damned, or the new Tomb Raider levels and stuff like that.
6878000	6886000	It's like, really? Why don't you just buy a card? You know, a points card. It's the same thing.
6886000	6890000	I don't know. It's retarded.
6890000	6897000	Alright, well, we'll see if this is true or not. One of my friends that works at GameStop is swearing to me up and down that the game is still available for pre-order in the computer.
6897000	6904000	So, who knows, it could be some weird misunderstanding that got spun, but either way, that's what the internet's saying this week, so we'll see.
6904000	6910000	But I agree with Loki, you know, not that GameStop is really into PC sales anyway, you know?
6910000	6918000	And for some people, there's never gonna be a replacement for walking in, grabbing a box in your hand, having the instruction manual, all that stuff.
6918000	6925000	You know, as I say, why do people buy CDs anymore? You really don't need to, in this day and age.
6925000	6932000	It's still better to, you can actually, on Amazon now, you can buy all of them as MP3s without the proprietary crap that iTunes has.
6932000	6934000	iTunes actually got rid of it.
6934000	6938000	Yeah, iTunes did just get rid of that. That means you can actually get it as an MP3 format.
6938000	6945000	Yeah, it's definitely not on their website, that's for sure, and they have the other games available on their download service.
6945000	6948000	But, you know, I don't know.
6948000	6955000	I'm sure we will see an official corporate response from one of the two in the next week, so you can probably bet we'll hear something about this next week.
6955000	6962000	Well, how about some different type of news?
6962000	6967000	How about something different? How about everybody getting along and living in peace and harmony?
6967000	6969000	And pooping rainbows, like you said earlier?
6969000	6971000	Only you're allowed to poop the rainbows, Rob.
6971000	6972000	Sorry.
6972000	6973000	You're the official rainbow pooper.
6973000	6974000	Thank you.
6974000	6981000	So, um, the dude that did Braid, Jonathan Blow, that makes me snicker.
6981000	6982000	You're so mature.
6982000	6983000	I know.
6983000	6987000	Anyway, is working on a 2D RPG.
6987000	6988000	What?
6988000	6999000	Yeah, he's working on a 2D RPG, but, um, it's, uh, I really don't know what else to say about it.
6999000	7006000	It's just, it looks like a 2D platformer type of RPG-ish sort of thing.
7006000	7018000	Um, but he said that he, um, wants to say that, um, the, they're trying, I guess, trying to do something specific with the actual way the game plays.
7018000	7023000	There's really not too many details on it, and he, I squeezed the ferret by accident.
7023000	7029000	And, um, and, uh, he actually doesn't really have, you know, that much attention that he's paying to it.
7029000	7032000	It's more like going, okay, I'm gonna work on the RPG.
7032000	7033000	Ooh, shiny!
7033000	7034000	So.
7034000	7039000	So, in other words, he'll do whatever he damn well pleases, but this is what's capturing his attention right now.
7039000	7040000	Yeah.
7040000	7041000	RPG.
7041000	7042000	Hmm.
7042000	7044000	Well, okay.
7044000	7051000	At least he's not developing it for the DS, and he's not gonna lock himself into a room because he can't get a dev team.
7051000	7056000	Hey, that guy, that guy apparently, uh, finally let himself out of the room, trashed his room.
7056000	7057000	That guy had issues.
7057000	7058000	Let's throw a fit now.
7058000	7061000	I don't even remember that guy's name, and even if it did, I wouldn't want to say it.
7061000	7065000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, I totally forgot about the guy, except I sort of remember us talking about it.
7065000	7069000	Yeah, remember the guy, he locked himself in the room and was throwing a fit because Nintendo wouldn't send him a dev kit or whatever?
7069000	7070000	Oh, the retard.
7070000	7075000	Yes, he finally quit his little tantrum and trashed his entire room on his way out.
7075000	7076000	I know, I know.
7076000	7081000	But yet, here we are talking about him, and lots of people did, so whatever.
7081000	7082000	His game looked lame anyways.
7082000	7083000	Yeah.
7083000	7084000	What do I care?
7084000	7086000	I mean, it's like, he's like, I need a dev kit.
7086000	7087000	I'm like, no, I don't want to play that game.
7087000	7088000	That game looks stupid.
7088000	7089000	I don't care if he wastes it.
7089000	7093000	It looked, seriously, it looked like something you'd make with RPG Maker.
7093000	7096000	Like the old RPG Maker.
7096000	7098000	Not anything good.
7098000	7100000	Sorry.
7100000	7101000	I don't know.
7101000	7105000	Maybe he put ZZT on the DS.
7105000	7106000	Yes, they do.
7106000	7107000	ZZT on the DS.
7107000	7108000	Yes, they do.
7108000	7109000	I say yes.
7109000	7110000	Alright, more news.
7110000	7120000	Alright, well, in the tradition of download content for EA games, Skate 2 has now put out some download, well, I wouldn't even call it download content, you download a key to unlock crap.
7120000	7136000	Basically, it's a time is money pack, it costs you 400 Microsoft points, and it will unlock all locations, skaters, and gear that can be earned by playing through Skate 2's career and online modes.
7136000	7143000	So basically, for people that don't want to play the game, it'll just unlock everything right there for you.
7143000	7148000	Which begs the question, why even buy the game if you don't want to play through it?
7148000	7150000	So it's pay to unlock content.
7150000	7151000	Yes.
7151000	7152000	Which I always hate in video games.
7152000	7154000	It's pay to unlock cheat codes.
7154000	7155000	That's basically it.
7155000	7157000	They've done this before.
7157000	7158000	With other games, right?
7158000	7163000	Yep, Tiger Woods, uh, I'm trying to think of what else.
7163000	7164000	Ah, other EA games.
7164000	7168000	News about pay to unlock content makes me angry.
7168000	7170000	And here, yeah, AcidicVampire says it perfect in chat.
7170000	7174000	Chat.orangeworms.com, he says it's for lazy asses.
7174000	7176000	Absolutely, it is for lazy asses.
7176000	7182000	So to anyone that's actually going to support this kind of content and encourage them to put out this content in the future,
7182000	7184000	I'd like to dedicate a little piece of angst to you.
7199000	7201000	FUs of the week time, DarkSakura.
7201000	7211000	My biggest FUs go to, um, incessant bitching without the will to do anything about it.
7211000	7215000	And I'm not saying that that's what anybody in this room was doing.
7215000	7224000	I am saying that I have been hearing nothing but people bitching all week about stupid shit.
7224000	7229000	That they could just say something and it would be fixed.
7229000	7235000	That, you know, why are you complaining to me? What the crap can I do about that?
7235000	7240000	You know, or the, I'm up all night worrying about it.
7240000	7244000	What can you do about it at night? Worry about it when you can do something about it.
7244000	7246000	That's what my mother does.
7246000	7249000	She'll tell me about how she stayed up all night long worrying about something.
7249000	7252000	It's like, well, you're just making it worse.
7252000	7257000	And I've been accused of being bitchy about it.
7257000	7264000	But you know what? I really have, you know how much sympathy I have for the incessant complaining without doing shit about it?
7264000	7266000	Zero.
7266000	7268000	Mother Teresa, you ain't.
7268000	7271000	Well, Mother Teresa was a bitch.
7274000	7275000	Rob.
7275000	7276000	Only on this program.
7276000	7284000	No. Mother Teresa liked to make people suffer because it made them closer to God.
7284000	7291000	This is true. That's why all of her little hospitals were nothing better than hovels.
7291000	7295000	She wouldn't deliver medicine and would do nothing to ease her pain.
7295000	7298000	I didn't mean to open a can of worms during the FUs by analogy.
7298000	7300000	So yes, Mother Teresa was a bitch.
7300000	7306000	What if you were suffering from starvation? Wouldn't that make you closer to God because you're dying?
7306000	7308000	In her opinion, yes.
7308000	7311000	Also, Gandhi was a racist. But anyway.
7311000	7313000	Less controversy, more angst.
7313000	7315000	That's true.
7317000	7328000	At any rate, it's just, you know, for example, I have a friend who says she's gonna listen to the show and never dies.
7328000	7332000	And you know who she is. I'm not going to say on the air.
7332000	7339000	Who, at work, does nothing but complain about work.
7339000	7342000	About the same thing over and over again.
7342000	7344000	And complains about her family.
7344000	7346000	The same thing over and over and over again.
7346000	7348000	And it's the same crap that she does too.
7348000	7354000	And we're like, well, you know, all you have to do is this and you can fix it.
7354000	7356000	But blah blah blah blah blah.
7356000	7358000	Same thing over and over and over and over again.
7358000	7363000	You know, I know other people will be like, oh, well, I don't like this situation.
7363000	7366000	I'm like, well, get off your ass. Do something.
7366000	7372000	You know? I don't like my butt, so I go walking every day at lunch.
7372000	7378000	You know? And also, this goes in with it as well.
7378000	7384000	I also don't like for people to look for a crutch. You know what I mean?
7384000	7391000	To put all of their hopes in one place and expect that that is going to be the end all.
7391000	7393000	Oh my god.
7393000	7398000	And I would like to right now offer an apology to our president.
7398000	7402000	The very awesome and we have a handsome president too.
7402000	7408000	But I would like to apologize to President Obama on behalf of all the fucking morons
7408000	7411000	who thinks he can fix all the shit that's wrong in the government.
7411000	7414000	He might be able to get us started on the right path.
7414000	7416000	He might make a lot of good things happen.
7416000	7418000	I have a lot, you know, I've got faith in him.
7418000	7423000	He's, you know, so far he's made good on everything he said he was going to do, right?
7423000	7430000	You know? A person with that much integrity is going to try to do the best job he can.
7430000	7435000	But it's, you know, don't think that he's going to do all this shit for you.
7435000	7436000	You've got to help.
7436000	7440000	You know, everyone's got to start taking some responsibility for their own happiness
7440000	7444000	and for their own, you know, their own well-being.
7444000	7450000	You can't just say, hmm, my life sucks, and expect it to get better,
7450000	7454000	expect someone to go, I'll solve all your problems.
7454000	7455000	That's not how it works.
7455000	7457000	You know, there are no superheroes.
7457000	7460000	You just have to get off your ass and do it yourself.
7460000	7463000	If you can't do it by yourself, ask someone to help you.
7463000	7466000	But life doesn't fix itself.
7466000	7469000	You have to, you have to help, you know.
7469000	7473000	If you see someone out there doing good things, they probably could use your hand helping them out.
7473000	7481000	I bought ten cans of cat food, by the way, to help these people who were fostering homeless cats
7481000	7486000	at their own house in a no-kill shelter because they were trying to do some good in the world.
7486000	7489000	And because I believed in what they were doing, I contributed.
7489000	7492000	You know, cat food is an example.
7492000	7497000	But I'm just saying, you know, if you want something bad enough, make it happen.
7497000	7500000	It is a bummer, though. The economy didn't magically change overnight.
7500000	7503000	Did really. Who expected it to?
7503000	7504000	No, I know. I know.
7504000	7506000	If anyone expected it to, they're fucking stupid.
7506000	7508000	I know. Hopefully soon. Hopefully soon.
7508000	7511000	All right. Anymore. We gotta move on.
7511000	7512000	No, I'm sorry for ranting.
7512000	7514000	That's all right. Low-key.
7514000	7519000	F.U. Rockstar Games for making a crappy PC port of Grand Theft Auto IV.
7519000	7521000	Just reiterate that until I fix it.
7521000	7528000	And F.U. 2, the spring TV lineup for having too many damn shows on that I need to watch that happen to be on at the same time.
7528000	7531000	I can't do that. And you can't keep putting out cool shows.
7531000	7534000	Because then I get distracted. And it's not good.
7534000	7541000	I can't watch American Idol, Lie to Me, NipTuck, House, possibly Heroes.
7541000	7546000	Although it's supposed to suck this season, but I still gotta see how bad it's gonna suck.
7546000	7552000	Fringe. And some stupid dance competition show.
7552000	7553000	So you think you can dance?
7553000	7556000	No, it's that International Dance Stars or something like that.
7556000	7558000	It's got the Groove Blues on it, so I wanted to watch it.
7558000	7560000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're talking about.
7560000	7562000	Uh, is that it?
7562000	7563000	That's it.
7563000	7564000	My F.U. goes to the headache I have setting in.
7564000	7567000	Boo-hoo. I'm gonna have to go run in the house and take some ibuprofen.
7567000	7570000	Otherwise, um, I don't have a lot of F.Us.
7570000	7573000	I'm... I'm just... I'm in just, like, a bleh mood.
7573000	7575000	F.U. to being bleh.
7575000	7578000	That's what I feel like. I feel like, bleh.
7578000	7580000	There you go.
7580000	7583000	Uh, all right. That's gonna do it for the F.Us of the Week.
7583000	7586000	More angst next week.
7586000	7587000	Blow?
7587000	7589000	Blow.
7589000	7594000	Almost like a murloc, but I shouldn't say that because I'm now, uh, recovering from WoW.
7594000	7596000	If you were listening earlier in the show.
7596000	7599000	Okay, but I gotta say this. I was not, like, addicted to WoW.
7599000	7602000	Like, I hate it because I made this thing in my live channel earlier,
7602000	7606000	and I'm having people tell me these stories about people who are really, really addicted to WoW.
7606000	7609000	Like, okay, I was never that bad. I know how to go outside.
7609000	7613000	I was social. I went to work. I paid my bills.
7613000	7615000	So, whatever.
7615000	7618000	Anyway, I don't want to get on that tangent.
7618000	7620000	Uh, I will talk instead about this.
7620000	7623000	We were mentioning, um, or the chat room, I should say, was mentioning.
7623000	7626000	When Dark Soccer was talking about Obama, somebody had made the comment about
7626000	7629000	he's the first president that did his addresses on YouTube.
7629000	7631000	Tigerclaw said that in the chat room.
7631000	7634000	Obama is the first president to post YouTube videos of his addresses.
7634000	7637000	So, very interesting how YouTube has come a long way.
7637000	7640000	The Xbox Marketplace, too. All the different, um...
7640000	7642000	All the inauguration stuff. Yeah, that partnership.
7642000	7644000	I think they're also in the PlayStation Network, I don't know.
7644000	7645000	MSNBC.
7645000	7650000	Um, and also, um, that actually, again, this is something I was watching on CNN.
7650000	7652000	Something that I think is cool.
7652000	7655000	I think we're gonna actually see a whole lot more of this coming out of the White House, too.
7655000	7662000	Um, he said that he wanted to be, um, much more transparent and available for the public.
7662000	7665000	He said the president is a public servant, and that's true, right?
7665000	7668000	I think we're gonna be seeing a whole lot more.
7668000	7671000	Because, you know, there's actually a Spider-Man comic with Obama in it, too.
7671000	7675000	But then, didn't he not let cameras in when he retook the oath?
7675000	7677000	I don't think that was him.
7677000	7679000	Just in case he fucked up again.
7679000	7681000	No, he didn't fuck up.
7681000	7683000	The guy repeating it... No.
7683000	7685000	He said it right.
7685000	7687000	The dude repeating it to him fucked up.
7687000	7689000	It was just one of those awkward...
7689000	7690000	Fired!
7690000	7693000	I just like how he just smiled and was like, did you screw up?
7693000	7698000	I don't want to get too political, but the whole fact that they had to do it a second time was ridiculous anyway.
7698000	7701000	Because there's an amendment in the Constitution that says Obama was president whether he said,
7701000	7704000	I like cupcakes, up there on the stand or not.
7704000	7706000	Which I do approve of that message.
7706000	7709000	That should be the new inauguration. I like cupcakes.
7709000	7711000	Hired.
7711000	7712000	Anyway.
7712000	7714000	And I'm rich, bitch!
7714000	7718000	But I'm saying, I'm saying, my point was, look for more of this.
7718000	7727000	I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this massive internet interaction with our government coming up.
7727000	7728000	So I think that's pretty cool.
7728000	7734000	Well, speaking of massive internet interaction, there's a whole version of Street Fighter that you can play on YouTube.
7734000	7736000	I believe it's some type of tie-in.
7736000	7737000	On YouTube?
7737000	7738000	Yes, on YouTube.
7738000	7741000	I believe it's some type of tie-in with Soda Toys or whatever because they keep featuring this.
7741000	7744000	But it's interesting and I'll play it here in the background here.
7744000	7751000	It's like this whole little Street Fighter thing and as you play it, you can click on a button while it's flashing to make a move.
7751000	7753000	It uses like the branching YouTube technology or whatever.
7753000	7755000	And so I can select my fighter.
7755000	7758000	So let's pick Zangief because he's the gay one.
7758000	7760000	So I clicked on him.
7760000	7762000	And it took me to Zangief versus Guile.
7762000	7764000	And now all the buttons are flashing, I can do stuff.
7764000	7766000	So like I clicked Y.
7766000	7770000	And it took me to another video where I got punched in the face by Guile.
7770000	7773000	But I'll click A now and try to hit him again.
7773000	7775000	And I get to hit him in another video.
7775000	7777000	Where I got kicked in the face again.
7777000	7779000	I am not very good at YouTube Street Fighter.
7779000	7780000	Because you have to hit it when it flashes.
7780000	7781000	I hit it when it flashed.
7781000	7782000	No, you stopped.
7782000	7783000	See?
7783000	7784000	Oh.
7784000	7785000	You have to hit it right when it flashes.
7785000	7786000	Go.
7788000	7789000	Oh wait, I'm Guile.
7789000	7791000	I'm playing against Zangief, huh?
7791000	7793000	So I guess this is a good thing.
7793000	7795000	Woohoo.
7795000	7797000	Anyway, so it's like this whole little interactive Street Fighter game.
7797000	7799000	The user's name if you want to see this.
7799000	7802000	Patrick B-O-I-V-I-N.
7802000	7805000	Unfortunately there's no real easy way to link a YouTube.
7805000	7808000	But that's it.
7808000	7811000	Interactive Street Fighter on YouTube.
7811000	7812000	Kind of interesting.
7812000	7815000	You know there's something though that I actually am curious about.
7815000	7817000	Did you ever play Mugen?
7817000	7820000	That was the fighting creature on Fighter, right?
7820000	7821000	Yeah.
7821000	7826000	That was a long time ago when the chat was talking about there should be an all games interactive versus Orange Lawn's radio like fighting game.
7826000	7829000	And they were going to do it in Mugen except nothing ever happened.
7829000	7838000	Well I actually, I've kind of got an idea for doing an Orange Lounge inspired Mugen.
7838000	7840000	There'll be more to come from this.
7840000	7849000	I would like to speak to people who are familiar with doing custom characters for Mugen and sprite editors.
7849000	7851000	That's all.
7851000	7852000	Alright.
7852000	7854000	But how about some different stuff?
7854000	7856000	Jason's yelling at me in chat saying,
7856000	7859000	Fuck, there's no easy way to link to YouTube. Link the first video.
7859000	7862000	Now I can do that for you guys in chat but remember it's a radio show.
7862000	7871000	I can't like exactly sit here and go, okay, go to YouTube.com uppercase L, uppercase P, uppercase, you know.
7871000	7874000	I can't exactly read that little garbage code there.
7874000	7876000	Anyway, sorry.
7876000	7878000	That's what tiny URL's for.
7878000	7881000	I guess. Even tiny URL's kind of pokey.
7881000	7883000	You know what one of my favorite games was though, Rob?
7883000	7884000	What is that?
7884000	7885000	When it came out a few years ago?
7885000	7887000	Hydro Thunder!
7887000	7889000	Dude, that game is still at a lot of arcades.
7889000	7892000	It's like one of the only actual arcade games you see in arcades.
7892000	7895000	I freaking love that game.
7895000	7898000	And I played the crap out of it on Dreamcast.
7898000	7899000	Hell yeah.
7899000	7900000	Well, guess what?
7900000	7907000	There's going to be a spiritual successor to Hydro Thunder called H2 Overdrive.
7907000	7909000	I know.
7909000	7916000	But I'm looking at pictures and it looks totally like how Hydro Thunder looks.
7916000	7917000	It basically is Hydro Thunder.
7917000	7919000	They remade some of the levels from the original game.
7919000	7921000	So why don't they just call it Hydro Thunder 2?
7921000	7923000	Because someone owns a trademark for that.
7923000	7925000	Oh, lame.
7925000	7929000	This is supposed to be out I think by Raw Thrills.
7929000	7935000	So they actually should be seeing it at the ATEI Expo in London.
7935000	7942000	If any of our listeners in London are going to be there, do take pictures, please.
7942000	7945000	But yeah, it's official.
7945000	7949000	In fact, 1UP has a preview of it with the video and everything.
7949000	7951000	So check it out.
7951000	7953000	Coming to an arcade menu maybe?
7953000	7955000	So there.
7955000	7956000	We'll see.
7956000	7957000	Sounds awesome.
7957000	7962000	It's going to be in the corner of all the pizza places now.
7962000	7970000	So there was some games talked about during Ubisoft's financial earnings.
7970000	7973000	I guess they have a conference call.
7973000	7978000	Of course, some of these franchises that they're bringing around, not that surprising.
7978000	7981000	Including Assassin's Creed 2.
7981000	7985000	And this is all coming between now and March 2010.
7985000	7993000	So Assassin's Creed 2, Splinter Cell Conviction, which was supposed to come out a long time ago and kept being delayed and delayed and delayed.
7993000	7995000	So that's not surprising.
7995000	7997000	A new Ghost Recon game.
7997000	8001000	Of course, Beyond Good and Evil 2, because that's already been announced.
8001000	8011000	And also they let another title slip that they weren't supposed to talk about, but Red Steel 2 is going to be coming out at some point.
8011000	8015000	Now with Wii Motion Plus.
8015000	8017000	How did that slip in there?
8017000	8019000	Oh, by the way, Red Steel 2.
8019000	8021000	No, he's like...
8021000	8023000	I forget what it was.
8023000	8029000	It says we have lots of products coming for the Wii next fiscal year.
8029000	8031000	We have Red Steel...
8031000	8034000	Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that.
8034000	8037000	GS68 in chat calls it Red Shit Teal 2.
8037000	8039000	Red Steel was very disappointing.
8039000	8041000	But this isn't a surprise, though.
8041000	8043000	I've heard them talk about Red Steel 2 before.
8043000	8045000	Well, they have to fix a lot of stuff if they're going to do that.
8045000	8047000	But you know what, though?
8047000	8049000	Conduit looks awesome.
8049000	8051000	I don't know. We'll see.
8051000	8053000	Maybe they can do it.
8053000	8059000	Alright, when I was telling you my Warcraft story earlier about how I left and everything.
8059000	8063000	I assured you I did not do it to go back to Final Fantasy XI.
8063000	8068000	And after some news this week, Lord knows if I could, I might have been banned.
8068000	8072000	Because apparently tons of the hardcore players were banned from Final Fantasy XI this week.
8072000	8079000	Although, just joking, obviously I would not have exploited a cheat in the game as these people did that got banned.
8079000	8092000	That's right, hundreds of people were banned from Final Fantasy XI this week for discovering an issue that allowed players to create multiple items for certain treasures and rewards in areas such as salvage and assault by exploiting the game system.
8092000	8102000	This was some type of bug. Apparently it's been out there for a while. And Squeenix finally did some emergency maintenance on November 26th.
8102000	8108000	That was a while ago. They went back, I guess, for all those logs and all that stuff and figured out who did this.
8108000	8114000	They temporarily suspended 400 players and 550 players who committed serious misconduct.
8114000	8116000	We ban you!
8116000	8118000	You can never play again.
8118000	8124000	So there it is. Apparently a lot of these banned players were long-time Final Fantasy XI players.
8124000	8127000	So who knows, maybe they did you a favor!
8130000	8138000	No, but that's got to really suck to put a lot of time into a game like that and then suddenly wake up banned one day.
8138000	8141000	And I get told in chat by my buddy Miklatov, he says,
8141000	8148000	You couldn't if you wanted to, Rob. You never made it to Endgame. That's true, I never did make it to Endgame. I played how many years of Final Fantasy XI and I never got to Endgame?
8148000	8157000	Nine months of WoW when I was in Endgame. And it sounds like if I played on Jamie's pirate server I could probably get to Endgame content in Ragnarok in about an hour.
8157000	8159000	No, no, no.
8159000	8161000	That's like 20 minutes.
8161000	8174000	No, not even that actually. You can get to level 150 no problem after rebirth. But it does take longer to level to 255.
8174000	8181000	But that's interesting though. Man, these guys, you could say, hey they cheated, they deserved it.
8181000	8187000	But that's very interesting that they let this exploit go on for so long and then they retroactively did that. Boy.
8187000	8194000	You know what, if they're not hacking the game, if it was just like a bug in the game that did that, I don't think they should punish them at all.
8194000	8202000	I mean, to be honest, if it's your poor programming that's caused this duplication glitch, I think you should fix it and that's the end of it.
8202000	8208000	They should have fixed it a long time ago instead of saying, oh, well you exploited this glitch that was in the game. I mean, I don't know.
8208000	8216000	Well, Warcraft's kind of done some similar things. For example, I was reading a story about a guild that downed one of the new bosses called Sarthurium.
8216000	8221000	And one of the hardest things to do in WoW right now is take out the boss Sarthurium with what's called all three drakes up.
8221000	8231000	Basically you fight a boss and three mini bosses all at once. And this guild found this way to exploit the boss fight by, I don't know, you drag him to some type of lava or something.
8231000	8240000	And basically if you just let it go on and on and on for five hours, you can win this fight. So it's more of an endurance thing, but you have to do it for five hours.
8240000	8250000	So they exploited it, got the title for doing it because you get a title if you do it, bragged about it on the official WoW forums and found themselves with a temporary ban.
8250000	8255000	All the people that were involved and got a rollback on the clock because of it.
8255000	8256000	That's kind of lame.
8256000	8274000	I remember when I was playing on IRO, if there were item duplication and things to happen like that, they'd do rollbacks. Because doing an inventory wipe of just one character would be kind of crappy.
8274000	8286000	Alright, anyway. Well, that's going to do it for our stories tonight. We will get to last minute stories very soon, but we do want to open it up to you guys and let you guys have a say and give us a call.
8286000	8291000	If you want to give us a call, our Skype line is open. It's 1-877-GAME-OLR. That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the United States and Canada.
8291000	8296000	Or you can give us a call on our Skype. It's Orange Lounge Radio is the name on Skype.
8296000	8308000	And we have opened up the Skype line and we're waiting for your calls. So while we wait for the buffer from our live chatty to get to the people listening so they know it's open, do we have a quick last minute story, Logan?
8308000	8317000	Yeah, remember that patent that they had for a directional sensing DS card? Well, apparently it's being used for some stargazing app that's coming to Japan.
8317000	8319000	That could be kind of interesting, actually.
8319000	8323000	Well, the app's actually pretty expensive. It's 8,190 yen.
8323000	8326000	Oh my gosh, it costs a lot for that kind of motion sensing technology.
8326000	8329000	It charts over 9,300 stars, planets, suns, and moons.
8329000	8333000	Strange. Hey, we got a call on the Skype line. Let's go to it. Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8333000	8338000	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. This is that guy that you can probably guess who it already is.
8338000	8342000	In case there's people listening for the first time, you should probably introduce yourself.
8342000	8343000	Hi, guys, I'm Jason.
8343000	8347000	Hi, Jason. Jason, our fearless webmaster. We're getting a new website soon, right?
8347000	8348000	We are.
8348000	8357000	I'm so freaking excited. Have you talked to Deek? We're going to have to come up with a title for him, too, because Jason is the webmaster, but Deek wrote the site.
8357000	8361000	So now we're going to have to think of a title for Deek, too. I don't know.
8361000	8366000	I was kind of trying to mold that over in my head, and I hadn't come up with anything yet.
8366000	8367000	Well, we'll think about it.
8367000	8370000	But definitely, Reddit is very important in all of this.
8370000	8374000	Yes, very, very important, and we have to think of a way to thank him publicly, so we'll think of something.
8374000	8376000	Anyhow, Jason, what did you call out tonight?
8376000	8383000	I don't know if you guys talked about this in your gaming weeks. I didn't see it in the show roll, and I missed the start of the show.
8383000	8387000	People aren't supposed to know that you can see what we talk about before the show.
8387000	8390000	I have secrets.
8390000	8391000	Alright, what's up?
8391000	8392000	Special privileges.
8392000	8401000	So, Konami Digital Entertainment released a certain demo. I don't remember if it was last week or this.
8401000	8404000	Is it sparking any... have you guys already talked about this?
8404000	8410000	We talked about it last week. During my gaming week last week, I mentioned, I'm assuming you're talking about Dance Dance Revolution Lite S or whatever it's called?
8410000	8412000	Was this seriously last week?
8412000	8421000	Yes, actually, here's the thing. Konami put out the press release this week, but the game's actually been on the store for like ten days.
8421000	8428000	But Konami is finally acknowledging its existence, which is weird, because one thing I will say about the game that I didn't say before,
8428000	8434000	one of the things that's in the game is this feature where you can hit the little thing, and it goes to Konami's website.
8434000	8438000	Touch Konami is what they're calling it, their little iPhone development page.
8438000	8439000	I don't wish to touch them.
8439000	8444000	Well, if you go to Touch Konami's website, they only have the Japanese website up.
8444000	8451000	You see a little placeholder for United States, and I think, I'm assuming Britain, but there's nothing that you can't press them.
8451000	8453000	You can only go to the Japanese site, which I can't understand.
8453000	8454000	Do you know if that's still the case?
8454000	8458000	So I thought when I saw the press release...
8458000	8464000	There you go. He's actually going into it right now.
8464000	8469000	My thought was that you would go to the website now that they put the press release out, and you could actually look at the website now.
8469000	8470000	But no, that's not up either.
8470000	8474000	So I don't know why they waited till now to put out the press release, but they did.
8474000	8480000	I'm just that behind. I only saw this, I just kind of stumbled across it during the week.
8480000	8484000	Did you know there's also a Silent Hill game on the store?
8484000	8492000	I think I saw it, and I just didn't get it, because I went to their company little section of the iTunes store, and I wanted to see what else they put up.
8492000	8499000	It's not even... They slapped Silent Hill sprites on a 3D maze game. It's not even anything.
8499000	8502000	Although the music's kind of cool, so I guess there's that, but yeah.
8502000	8504000	Yeah, and Touch Konami still has not changed.
8504000	8508000	Japan is deep black, and United States and Europe are gray, and you can't do it.
8508000	8509000	That's right, can't do it.
8509000	8511000	Well, what did you think of the demo?
8511000	8516000	So what did you think of the demo? I already talked about it last week, and now you know to go back and listen, but what did you think of the demo?
8516000	8521000	This sure is hell more impressive than any other mobile version of the game that's come out yet.
8521000	8526000	Granted, the last time a mobile version of the game came out was, what, the original Game Boy?
8526000	8532000	Yeah, but dude, the Xbox version had a better frame rate than the iPhone one does for me.
8532000	8534000	I don't get why that's a bad thing.
8534000	8544000	It's fluid and everything, because I'm making fun of it, because the Xbox one had those crappy, skippy frame rate issues, and like, my iPhone thing will skip while I'm playing the game.
8544000	8553000	It's a very nice-looking demo, and it's very pretty and flashy and very showy, and the song they picked is pretty good, but yeah.
8553000	8561000	I can perfect attack those songs on real DDR, and I can't even get a full combo yet on the phone version.
8561000	8563000	Yeah, I haven't managed a combo yet either.
8563000	8569000	It's tough. But it's a demo, it's free, it's hard to knock it, DDR fans will eat it up, so...
8569000	8573000	Depending on how expensive it is, I'm considering getting it when they actually release it.
8573000	8577000	That is what they're trying to sell their finalized product on, so we'll see.
8577000	8589000	And it is technically impressive for what it is. There's a character in the background, I haven't actually sat down and really started memorizing it to see if it's random or not, but there's a nice series of visualizations.
8589000	8596000	Everything in the game looks damn near the way it should be, the way it has been.
8596000	8604000	The character in the background, the music quality is beautiful. It's impressive, and I just have to see how much they're gonna charge for when it actually comes out.
8604000	8613000	You have to remember, despite all my bitching about Songlist and everything, I mean, frame rate and everything, you have to remember it's a freaking cell phone game, and not bad.
8613000	8616000	For a cell phone. For a cell phone game.
8616000	8624000	And like I said, especially compared to all of their other mobile releases thus far, which is also a very hard comparison, but it's still very valid.
8624000	8627000	True. Any other thoughts, Jason, before we let you go?
8627000	8629000	My arms hurt a whole lot.
8629000	8631000	Sorry to hear it.
8631000	8640000	I was gonna make a masturbation joke, but I guess since you've actually moved, you have a legitimate excuse, and I'll let you go just this once without making a joke at your expense.
8640000	8642000	Alright, bye Jason.
8642000	8643000	Night.
8643000	8650000	You wanna give us a call? 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. Loki, another story to tide us over?
8650000	8657000	Yeah, sure. Let's see. Well, there's another WiiWare title that we forgot to talk about.
8657000	8662000	Pole's Big Adventure, which is coming from Sega. It is a parody of a bunch of 8-bit games.
8662000	8675000	It takes place, I guess, it's developed by the Phantasy Star Universe producer, and there are 100 hidden gangs in the game, including, for example, if you eat a mushroom, your character will grow beyond the size of the screen.
8675000	8684000	Very ironic, considering Dark Sakura was just a minute ago talking about, you know, in part A, I should say, about an hour ago, talking about a 8-bit parody Sega game.
8684000	8685000	Oh, I'm sorry.
8685000	8690000	No, no, no, no. I mean, she was talking about, like, Alex Kidd in Shinobi World. It's not making reference to it. It's funny that all these years-
8690000	8696000	Yeah, Mario. Also, I'm watching The Little Big Planet, Super Mario, Sack Brothers level.
8696000	8703000	It's- I've played that level. It's interesting. Anyway, the phone lit up again. I want to go to it. Hi, caller, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8703000	8705000	Uh, this is Spazinator.
8705000	8708000	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?
8708000	8716000	Um, I just want to double-check and make sure I heard you right. Did you just say earlier in the show that you gave up WoW?
8716000	8718000	Run that by me again?
8718000	8721000	Did you say that you gave up WoW?
8721000	8728000	Yes, earlier in the show, in part A, I'm taking a long, extended, long, long break from WoW.
8728000	8736000	Is that even possible? It's like, you know, you're making the experience like saying that the Buffalo Bills is going to win the Super Bowl or something.
8736000	8744000	It is true. I'll post the screenshot of my cancelled account if you guys don't believe me, but it's true.
8744000	8750000	Uh, DarkSakura, maybe you want to check to see if you're, like, breaking a fever or anything like that.
8750000	8757000	You know, that doesn't seem to really, you know, make a whole lot of sense.
8757000	8764000	You know, simply because I know you are a big fan of WoW, and DarkSakura is a big fan of Wrecking Rock.
8764000	8770000	You know, you guys gave it up both games. You know, it seems a little out of place, you know?
8770000	8777000	I'm a huge fan of WoW, but I was a bigger fan of the people that play WoW and the people that I interacted with in my guild.
8777000	8783000	But it's not like I'm dead, and many of those people I already knew before I played WoW, and I will continue to know.
8783000	8789000	But, um, WoW is just getting to the point where it was like a second job, and, you know, I just need to take a break.
8789000	8795000	I'm not knocking the game. Blizzard has put a phenomenal game out there that people give a lot of unnecessary shit to.
8795000	8802000	But for the show, this is going to be great, because I've got like a million video games to catch up on, so it's going to be great.
8802000	8815000	Well, for what it's worth, I know you kind of touched on it a little while ago, but, you know, if you're looking for another MMO, personally, I can recommend Final Fantasy XI.
8815000	8828000	You know, at least on the two servers that I'm on, which are, like, Odin and Alexander, there's a lot of really great people on there, and, you know, we're constantly, like, doing stuff.
8828000	8837000	You know, whether it be, you know, stuff for, like, the new expansion, Wings of the Goddess, doing all.
8837000	8845000	I gotta say this, Fazinator, Loki and I actually played Final Fantasy XI for, like, three years for an ungodly long time.
8845000	8855000	I hear a lot has changed in the time I was away while I was gone in WoW, and a lot of it sounds really interesting, but it's just kind of a place I'm not really interested in going back to.
8855000	8860000	But again, not knocking the game. There's a lot of great things about Final Fantasy XI. I hope you guys have a blast.
8860000	8867000	But I think for me right now, I don't want to quit an MMO to just go play another MMO, at least until the Star Trek MMO comes out.
8867000	8871000	Then I might change my mind. But for right now, I'm not really seeking another MMO.
8871000	8881000	You know, I've tried Warhammer, I've tried WoW, I've tried Ragnarok, I've tried, you know, a lot of these games, and for right now, I think I just need to go outside.
8881000	8885000	Or play, you know, and play console games, too. There's a lot of great console games I need to play.
8885000	8893000	Yeah, it's true. Well, you know, thanks for taking my call. I don't want to take up too much more of your time.
8893000	8896000	I mentioned there's probably a lot of people trying to call in, so...
8896000	8902000	No, it's no problem, and I'm glad I can clarify and get the questions answered, and I know there's probably a lot of people that are like,
8902000	8909000	Oh my gosh, what? This is big news. But, you know, I'm trying not to make it such a big deal, because I don't think it needs to be a big deal.
8909000	8916000	If it was a big deal, then that insinuates that it was too big a part of my life, so it just further justifies my need to take a break.
8916000	8920000	Anyhow, thanks for the call, Spazinator, and have a good one.
8920000	8926000	A comment from RicePrincess, who's listening right now. Of course you love RicePrincess, she was here last week.
8926000	8932000	If Rob's going to play an MMO again, it's going to be Hello Kitty Online. Very tempting, Hello Kitty Online.
8932000	8938000	Very tempting to at least look. There's Hello Kitty Online. Yeah, I believe it's free. I might have to do this.
8938000	8944000	Another one looked interesting. 1877 Game OLR, Orange Lawns Radio. What, DarkSucker? I like Hello Kitty.
8944000	8954000	Me too. Loki? I was going to say, they keep advertising that free, was it Fusion, I think, Fusion Fall or something like that? The Cartoon Network game?
8954000	8963000	Oh yeah. You know, again, I have such a huge backlog of Xbox and Playstation 3 games I need to play, I don't want to look for another MMO right now.
8963000	8970000	The only exception I might make is something like, actually, something like Phantasy Star Online actually sounds like a lot of fun.
8970000	8977000	Because, you know, as DarkSucker has said, you can play it forever, or you can play it for like five minutes, pretty much. You know, just do one little area.
8977000	8981000	That sounds more tempting than anything else I've heard so far.
8981000	8984000	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
8984000	8994000	Yeah, damn it. This is the, that one Swede. That called like on your year show and didn't know what to say, actually.
8994000	9000000	That one Swede. We love Swedish people. They gave us ABBA, remember? No, I'll stop making those jokes.
9000000	9002000	What is on your mind?
9002000	9018000	What was I going to say? Well, I played like a few more PC games. Plus, I haven't quit WoW, I just, speaking of WoW, I haven't quit WoW either.
9018000	9023000	But this month I can't play because I'm too poor to actually pay for it.
9023000	9035000	Other than that, well, what was I going to say? Yeah, F.E.A.R. 2, the demo was released.
9035000	9048000	Yes, somebody sent me a Twitter message telling me I had to, I don't know if it was you, somebody on Twitter, actually I think it was Twitter, sent me a message, Twitter or Facebook, sent me a message saying you need to check out F.E.A.R. 2, it's the best demo I've played in a long time.
9048000	9056000	I did queue it up on my PlayStation 3 to check out, so I will definitely see that for next week, but I'm assuming you've already played it.
9056000	9085000	Yeah, of course I played it on a PC. The thing is that the last five minutes of the demo is really kicking ass. I'm not even sure if I'm going to spoil it, but you get to pilot this mecha thingy.
9085000	9089000	You get to pilot a mech thingy?
9089000	9117000	Yeah, you get to pilot some sort of robot, whatever, especially since, if I remember right, the developers of F.E.A.R. 2, Monolith, they released an old game of theirs called Shogun Mobile Assault, whatever, yada yada, something.
9117000	9134000	Which was a hybrid of a bit of everything, since in that game you could pilot big robots, and they are quite big fans of piloting robots.
9134000	9139000	Here's my question about F.E.A.R. 2, was it scary?
9139000	9157000	Yes, it was. If you're going to play it on PS3, I don't even know, but I will say this, apparently it requires an almost hefty computer to play.
9157000	9176000	Even though I can say that, well, I played it on my old, one of the first generation core duo 2, and it rolled just fine. But then again, I didn't crank it up until, like, massive, so...
9176000	9188000	And what more? Oh yeah, Dawn of War 2 has been the multiplayer beta for that, has started.
9188000	9190000	Oh, and how's that going?
9190000	9213000	That's going just fine. It's sort of almost played, almost, almost. Well, it is Dawn of War, but it's most character-focused, in the sense that it's really commander-based, or something.
9213000	9229000	Random question for you. Did you hear our story earlier about the brick and mortar store GameStop, huge here in the US, I don't know if you have them over there, refusing, well, rumor, refusing to sell this game in their stores because of the digital distribution. Do you think that would hurt this game?
9229000	9250000	Well, here's the other thing, is that, well, I don't even, it might do, but here's the other thing. First of all, I got into the beta due to the following fact that I did bought Soulstorm on Steam.
9250000	9262000	And since THQ does have their, most of their games on Steam, or at least a few of them, that was due to that.
9262000	9283000	Alright, well, okay, Ripper, we're going to let you go try to get one more call in, but keep gaming. It sounds like even though you mentioned you were poor, you're still finding ways to get your game on through all these demos and beta tests.
9283000	9294000	That would be a good one, because at least I know the plug's going to get pulled on Tabula Rasa before too long, so I can't get that sucked into it. Good suggestion. Alright, okay, we got to let you go, buddy, but have a good one.
9294000	9302000	All the way from Sweden, my friends, AK Ripper, giving us a call here on Orange Lounge Radio. We love hearing from the international listeners, it's always a good time.
9302000	9313000	Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR in the US and Canada, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. Do we have another last minute story, Loki?
9313000	9336000	Mario Kart Source PC mod is being worked on right now, and of course using Half-Life 2's source engine, they're making a Mario Kart mashup game that takes the best features of all the other games and throws them all in the one. I am very excited about this news, because Mario Kart with custom levels, oh yeah, that'll be awesome.
9336000	9344000	Good times, good times. Let's go to the call of phones. Take one more call before we're out of here for tonight. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9344000	9348000	Legend of Zaku. Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
9348000	9353000	Nothing much, just spending another lazy Sunday at home.
9353000	9358000	Me too. But I do this internet radio show thing on Sunday nights, I don't know if you've heard.
9358000	9375000	But yeah, I guess basically it's been going off with Microsoft and everything, pretty much you reap what you sow in terms of delivering products which basically call for people to get laid off.
9375000	9381000	Oh, are we talking about the whole Windows Vista being blamed for the recent Microsoft layoffs?
9381000	9394000	I guess. Well, either that or they're just trying to outsource the rest of the jobs. But besides the point, it just sucks to see that the folks created Flight Simulator pretty much getting canned.
9394000	9398000	I mean, they didn't have anything to do. That's a damn good tool for pilots.
9398000	9400000	That's a game I remember from when I was a kid.
9400000	9406000	Not only is it a game, but it's a resource for people who are really big into flying.
9406000	9410000	True, true. It's hard to call that a game. It really is a simulator.
9410000	9422000	But it can be considered a game in that sense. I mean, you do it to each his own, whoever enjoys flying around for several hours in a virtual plane.
9422000	9431000	I gotta ask you this, I'm sorry if this is what you wanted to call in and talk about, but I have to ask you because I know you're a big, big fan of Beatmania 2DX and that whole series.
9431000	9443000	I don't know if you've been listening since the top of the show tonight, but Loki was talking about a new game at the top of the show tonight called Scratch, which is like a hip-hop version of Beatmania 2DX that's coming out this June. Thoughts?
9443000	9447000	No, I'm not into hip-hop, unfortunately.
9447000	9462000	There are certain songs in 2DX, for example, certain other songs that are faster to scratch on. Damn, I wish I could name them off the top of my head.
9462000	9484000	Yeah, I mean, to each his own, I guess, as long as it allows a person to actually literally scratch on the DJ, I mean on the turntable, and if the controller for it is actually any good, if it's just like cracking DJ with only two turntables and maybe a crossfader, it could be a lot more realistic than 2DX.
9484000	9491000	We'll see. Zaku, did you have any other thoughts for us before we let you go and wrap up the show tonight?
9491000	9499000	Um, besides that, download that Fear 2 demo. I don't care for what system you have, PS3, 360, or your PC, get that shit.
9499000	9500000	Yes, sir.
9500000	9502000	Let's get it down. Get it fucking down.
9502000	9504000	I'll do it, because Zaku told me to.
9504000	9506000	Alright, Zaku, you have a good one.
9506000	9510000	Yup.
9510000	9514000	Have a good one, Zaku. Yup.
9514000	9515000	He's awesome.
9515000	9525000	One of the several OLR listeners I've met in person. In fact, I am trying to get back to New York City this year, just to heads up, folks. I don't know when, but it's one of my goals.
9525000	9531000	If I told you why I'm really going to New York City, though, you'd laugh at me, but I do have a friend that lives out there, as you all know, and I'm trying to get back out there this year.
9531000	9532000	Want to hear something awesome?
9532000	9533000	What's that, Louis?
9533000	9546000	Well, we're thinking of, because I remember I have that company vacation that I can take, that $1500 one, so we were going to go to Seattle, but it's kind of boring if you just go there for Seattle.
9546000	9547000	I love Seattle.
9547000	9557000	Yeah, whatever. Okay, so we're thinking of going to Disneyland instead. But now, since Conan O'Brien's taken over for Jay Leno, he films in LA.
9557000	9559000	That's true. That's true.
9559000	9561000	When's he starting? In the summer?
9561000	9565000	Soon, I think. I mean, they're already seeing who's filming.
9565000	9571000	You're going to spend your $1500 vacation on LA? I mean, no offense, but you can drive to LA on the weekend, for God's sake.
9571000	9573000	Well, Nellie hasn't been there yet.
9573000	9579000	Well, you should go to the East Coast. New York City's a wonderful place to go.
9579000	9584000	Yeah, but the thing is, they only cover $1500. I mean, that's the flight right there. We don't want to spend there.
9584000	9588000	No, no, you can get a JetBlue flight out of Sacramento for $250.
9588000	9590000	Yeah, but still, though, that's...
9590000	9596000	You can actually get, every so often, Southwest does the two-for-one specials, too.
9596000	9597000	True.
9597000	9600000	It's just, you know, we just want to, I don't know.
9600000	9609000	LA's not terrible. And, you know, you would have an extravagant LA trip for $1500. You know, you could pamper yourself a little bit. I'm sure the wife will like that, but...
9609000	9610000	Disneyland!
9610000	9611000	And Disneyland is pretty fabulous.
9611000	9621000	We would go to Disneyland and maybe Universal Studios. I do want to see Conan, though, since my dream to go to Price is Right with Bob Barker hosting is, you know, long past.
9621000	9627000	You should still go to Price is Right. I would love to see Loki and the wife on a game show. That's what I want to see.
9627000	9630000	You guys need to go on one of those...
9630000	9631000	It would never happen.
9631000	9634000	You guys need to go on one of those low-budget game shows like Lego.
9634000	9639000	I don't have the game show appeal. I'm not, like, some crazy redneck or, like, you know...
9639000	9640000	Dude, you do a radio show on the internet.
9640000	9641000	I...
9641000	9642000	About video games. That's a pretty awesome niche.
9642000	9646000	And no one gives a shit. No one gives a shit. You tell them that and they're like...
9646000	9653000	Yeah. You're not in the military, are you? No? Sorry. You go back to the audience portion of the...
9653000	9658000	I don't know. I would never... They would never call me on one of those shows.
9658000	9663000	It would be awesome, but no, they would never do that. Never, ever, ever.
9663000	9669000	It's just like I've given up on getting, like, the employee of the month thing at my work because that'll never, ever happen.
9669000	9676000	I love this. D5T1. I don't know if there's an easier way to pronounce that. In chat, D5T1 suggests Supermarket Sweep.
9676000	9679000	Hey, dude. Supermarket Sweep is awesome. Is that still on TV?
9679000	9683000	I don't know if they make new episodes. I think it's on PAX or something. I think...
9683000	9688000	Surely that guy's still hosting shows. He could be. They could still be doing it.
9688000	9689000	Supermarket Sweep's awesome.
9689000	9696000	Dude, Loki would, like, load that card up with those turkeys. Be awesome.
9696000	9702000	I think all of us want to go on Supermarket Sweep. Who doesn't want to go on Supermarket Sweep?
9702000	9710000	Hold on. I'm actually, thanks to the powers of Wikipedia, I'm looking it up right now.
9710000	9717000	No, it looks like it went off the air in 2003. They probably still run it in repeats, but that's that. 2003 is when it stopped.
9717000	9721000	And I don't hate New York. It's just it's so damn expensive to travel there.
9721000	9730000	It's not... New York was my first pick. And it was just, you know, it wouldn't work out as far as, like, you know...
9730000	9739000	We don't want to spend our own money, and the problem is that $1500 can only be used on the hotel and on travel.
9739000	9745000	And I don't think we could do... It's all weird, because it has to be booked through, like, Expedia and stuff like that.
9745000	9747000	I don't know. It's lame, but...
9747000	9751000	I'm going to find you a fun $1500 trip that's better than LA. I'm going to make it my mission for $1500.
9751000	9754000	Well, there's only certain cities I can go to, so...
9754000	9755000	Alright, alright. We'll see, we'll see.
9755000	9758000	Well, I actually am going on vacation again.
9758000	9764000	I wanted to make sure that I said something about it. Not really a vacation, it's more like a family visit.
9764000	9769000	I'm going to Washington. To Prosser, Washington.
9769000	9771000	Wait, is that mean you're going to be gone next week?
9771000	9772000	Yes.
9772000	9773000	Oh, what a bummer!
9773000	9777000	Yes. I doubt I'll have internet or anything.
9777000	9779000	Well, gosh, Dark Soccer.
9779000	9781000	I'm going to visit Dan's family, which, you know...
9781000	9786000	And, no offense, Ranma, I'm not going to go crash with you if I travel to New York City with my wife.
9786000	9788000	No, that's not going to happen.
9788000	9793000	Yeah, even the wife wouldn't have lots of sex while they're on vacation. They're not going to do it in your spare bedroom.
9793000	9797000	No, if we're going to go on vacation, we're going to go on vacation in a nice hotel and stuff like that.
9797000	9799000	We're not going to just go crash at someone's house.
9799000	9803000	That's something like if I was going to an anime convention or something in New York City.
9803000	9804000	Plus, Nelly would freak.
9804000	9806000	Yeah, if it were just me...
9806000	9808000	You don't know the wife.
9808000	9812000	If it were just me traveling to New York City for something, then, yeah, that would be probably fine.
9812000	9816000	But, you know, not with the wife. No, that doesn't work that way.
9816000	9821000	Alright, anyhow, we've got to wrap up the show and get the hell out of here.
9821000	9822000	Yeah.
9822000	9823000	Let's get everybody's final thoughts.
9823000	9827000	Dark Sakura, welcome back and see you next in two weeks, I guess.
9827000	9830000	What a bummer, because next week we have the...
9830000	9835000	Bobby's not on the air, so we've got a lot of time to kill next week, so we'll see what happens.
9835000	9837000	But enjoy the trip to Prosser.
9837000	9839000	We're driving.
9839000	9841000	It's a pretty drive, though.
9841000	9844000	Seventeen fucking hours.
9844000	9848000	Make the best of it. Take pictures. Bring it back.
9848000	9851000	Get you to poo with your hubby.
9851000	9855000	Any final thoughts on the show before we go?
9855000	9858000	I want some ice cream.
9858000	9861000	Ice cream does sound delicious. Very delicious.
9861000	9864000	My final thought is...
9864000	9868000	The only thing better than ice cream is that ice cream that was made out of Samoas.
9868000	9870000	And I don't care what they call them now.
9870000	9873000	The caramel delights are sort of the crap Samoas.
9873000	9874000	Loki, what's your final thought?
9874000	9876000	Final thought is...
9876000	9878000	I need to find a song for Cage Match.
9878000	9880000	I know which song I want, but it's in my car and I don't want to walk out.
9880000	9882000	Dude, I think you won the last time we did a Cage Match.
9882000	9886000	Well, I also like the song by Uncle called Burn My Shadow.
9886000	9889000	It's in the new teaser trailer for Fuel.
9889000	9893000	Which is going to be the next kickass racing game I'm really into.
9893000	9897000	Basically, from the creators of Dirt and Grid.
9897000	9902000	They're doing a racing game that's in an alternate future.
9902000	9906000	Where weather has changed the face of Earth.
9906000	9910000	And basically, you're racing through tornadoes and shit.
9910000	9912000	So, that sounds awesome.
9912000	9916000	And they actually have a video of racing through tornadoes.
9916000	9918000	So, I'm done with that.
9921000	9924000	This is kind of a bummer final thought from YYR in our chatroom.
9924000	9926000	Of course, he's the man who made Snake 360.
9926000	9928000	We had him on the show a few weeks ago.
9928000	9931000	As of right now, the Snake 360 contests are now over.
9931000	9935000	F you to the major gaming sites for not covering them because not enough people entered.
9935000	9938000	I can't even give away all the prizes.
9938000	9939000	Bummer.
9939000	9940000	Sorry to hear it.
9940000	9941000	We'll take your prizes.
9941000	9943000	But no, in all seriousness.
9943000	9946000	As I was telling somebody, I gave somebody advice earlier in the week.
9946000	9948000	I gotta remember, Rome wasn't built in a day.
9948000	9951000	So, sometimes it takes a long time.
9951000	9955000	We did OLR for many, many years with only like a dozen people listening.
9955000	9959000	Before we finally broke it and got two dozen people listening.
9959000	9961000	And that's about where we're at now.
9961000	9963000	So, no.
9963000	9965000	But again, and I say this at the end of every show.
9965000	9967000	Remember, it's the community that helps make Orange Lounge Radio.
9967000	9970000	And without you guys, life would suck a lot.
9970000	9973000	And we would not be as motivated to do the program.
9973000	9977000	So, thank you guys, as always, for tuning into this program and spending your Sunday nights with us.
9977000	9981000	Please, if you like the show, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.
9981000	9984000	Help us spread the word because, again, we don't have any major.
9984000	9986000	We don't get covered by the major gaming sites either.
9986000	9990000	Unless, you know, they're accusing Loki of breaking an NDA or something.
9990000	9992000	We don't get any coverage from major gaming sites either.
9992000	9994000	So, we only get word of mouth.
9994000	9995000	That's really it.
9995000	9998000	So, leave us a nice review on iTunes or any other podcast site.
9998000	10000000	Help spread the word for Orange Lounge Radio.
10000000	10004000	But until next time, myself, Dark Soccer in two weeks.
10004000	10008000	And Loki next week will be back to do it all over again.
10008000	10010000	See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10010000	10014000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
