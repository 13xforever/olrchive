13953	23595	Tonight, January 25th, 2009, GameTap removes some of its free games, Dawn of War 2 disappears from GameStop, and did Uebo finally win a movie award?
31365	36288	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36328	42652	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42712	52899	We do tape live on Sunday nights every week at allgames.com and it's all brought to you by myself, Rob Roberts, and my wonderful co-host, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
53899	54640	Worship me!
55340	57602	Back after a week of absence.
58162	59663	What were you doing in your week of absence?
60200	61520	Writing the charter for my cult.
62521	62961	Wonderful.
63301	68242	Yes, this is a conversation carried over from Bobby's show, which can be heard before us Sunday nights live.
68262	69502	Official drink is Propel.
70482	73843	And DarkSakura apparently is going to be fixing the economy by starting a cult.
74163	75643	And somehow this is going to fix the economy.
75743	77004	My plan is brilliant.
77864	86726	Because the companies aren't making enough money because the consumers aren't buying because they don't have money because they've been losing equity in their home and going into foreclosure and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
87026	88246	So I'll tell you what.
89198	90098	Give me all your money.
91839	96781	I will go and pump money back into the economy on my wild spending spree.
97402	103505	Help the banks by getting the biggest mortgage ever, which I will be paying off with your money, of course.
104405	108047	And, you know, personally revitalizing our bank and credit system.
108267	110448	And what about everybody else who's broke because they gave you money?
110468	111128	What are they going to do?
111968	114990	Well, when the economy's better, hi, they'll get new money.
116403	117124	And jobs!
117184	120446	There'll be jobs to accommodate my shopping spree.
121367	124009	You know, whenever I think about cults... And there's more.
124650	130374	With the stuff I decide not to keep any longer after my wild shopping spree, I put it back on eBay.
131155	137260	And all these people who now have jobs to accommodate my needs can buy the stuff off of eBay.
137420	138180	It's brilliant.
139001	140082	And I replenish my money.
140943	141143	Yeah.
141514	142315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
160865	161405	Grand Theft Auto 4 The Work
188832	190393	on my PC.
191773	196396	Basically, what it comes down to now is I'm going to have to actually reinstall Windows for it to work.
197076	199677	That's quality developing right there.
200597	201218	Quality.
201458	205900	When a game requires you to reinstall your operating system for it to work correctly.
207841	208381	Good job.
208401	208841	Kudos, Rockstar.
208901	211302	Have you thought about calling customer support or anything?
212443	216925	I post on GTA forums and they have Rockstar Toronto is actually their
220553	222735	Are other people having the problems you're having, or is it just you?
222755	227698	Yeah, some people are having the same problems I'm having, no one's helping them either, and people are also having other problems.
227978	231140	There's a new patch that came out that caused even more problems, so awesome!
231160	232360	What are you talking about?
232401	233721	There's no problems!
233781	234882	Sweep under the rug, sweep under the rug.
234902	243347	Yeah, it's only, it's less than 1% of, yeah, see they pulled the old Microsoft bit where it's all, it's less than 1% of our customers are having problems with Grand Theft Auto 4.
243647	245949	It's just they happen to be the most vocal of the bunch here.
246209	248692	How does it feel to be less than 1%, Loki?
250014	250715	I'm special.
250855	252417	I have three words for you.
253298	254520	Better business bureau.
254880	256542	I have more words for you.
257183	260427	I'm pirating their next game and I'm not buying their shit anymore.
261449	262891	How is that going to hurt them?
265197	265997	Thanks for watching!
282583	283463	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
310131	310671	Thanks for watching!
329704	330705	Because there's nothing I can do.
330725	331965	There's plenty you can do.
332465	335487	Okay, I can call their customer service and they go, oh, I don't know what's wrong.
335927	339429	Oh, you can, you know, send a letter into the CEO.
339509	342791	You can write the Better Business Bureau and file a complaint.
342851	345452	Or he can get on his podcast and tell hundreds of people.
345552	349414	I'm just saying, okay, I'm overestimating our listener base a little bit.
349434	350614	He can tell dozens of people.
351295	352195	This is a problem I have.
352255	354216	I'm just going to say it for the FUs.
355637	358498	I'm just saying, though, I mean, I've been more than...
360652	364534	I've been more than generous to them, I should say.
365314	374619	At our work, we have a LAN set up and everything, and I've purchased copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 on 360 for each one of those systems.
374679	377160	That's five different systems that have that game.
377761	380202	I think overall, I purchased about six copies of that game.
380562	382463	I'd say that's more than generous.
382843	384164	And the fact that I was even...
385117	385918	Thanks for watching!
407805	412688	And yes, and sadly enough, I'll probably be buying the download content that'll be coming out for Grand Theft Auto 4.
413308	416390	And I may even buy the download content for each one of those systems.
416430	417451	That's $100 right there.
417931	418551	But you know what?
420172	421113	I don't know.
421893	427536	I think unless they come out... Because basically what it is now is, oh, well, something in your system is causing it not to work.
428197	428457	Really?
428537	432759	Thanks for narrowing it down to something in my computer causing it not to work.
433640	435741	I was worried that it might have been the birds outside.
437843	439545	You don't want to see me on the phone with customers.
461892	463274	But it's annoying.
463334	469320	I even went and uninstalled and reinstalled Service Pack 3 just to see if maybe that would fix it, but of course not.
470441	473625	Oh, and it doesn't help either that it takes 40 minutes to install Grand Theft Auto.
475864	476224	All right.
476284	480225	Well, hey, our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com is making a request.
480245	483006	Of course, we always like to have the chat room involved during our show tonight.
483226	488407	A request that if Loki does decide to call customer service, please, please record it and play it on a future episode.
489027	489627	But here's my thing.
489647	489968	Here's my thing.
489988	491048	I don't want to go too far into this.
491108	497509	But, I mean, is calling customer service â€“ I mean, a lot of those reps, no disrespect, they do a very thankless job.
497789	498890	I did customer service.
498930	499110	Right.
499450	500150	And I teach for it.
500530	502531	But, you know, they're kind of given a script.
502551	503311	They're given limits.
503691	506192	They can't change a lot at their level.
506392	510653	If he really wants something to happen, he's going to have to get attention of people upstairs.
510733	511914	I'm going through the right routes.
511934	517035	I'm going through GTA forums, and they have the developers on there actually reading people's comments.
517395	519856	So they're supposedly looking into things.
519876	521436	They're supposed to also be...
523157	523898	Thanks for watching!
536226	536847	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
555006	555406	Period.
555446	560709	Just stops working, and no matter how many times I uninstall it, reinstall it, do whatever, it does not work.
560789	561709	That doesn't make any sense.
561829	564870	DarkSakura's dying to make a comment, and then we gotta move on to Gaming Weeks.
565030	566371	It's actually about customer service.
566511	567451	Yeah.
568732	570213	Rob, have you done customer service yourself?
570373	570953	Oh, well, yeah.
571013	572134	It's the industry I work in.
572454	574615	But have you answered the calls?
574815	575035	Okay.
575155	576155	Yes, of course.
576275	577476	I have to, to be able to teach him.
577847	592640	Well, not necessarily my work, but I did customer service, and I can actually say that script is only good for the first month of the job, and after that, a good rep is going to know their shit, know who to go to, and know how to solve your problem.
593140	598564	Don't get me wrong, especially at the place I work, we've got great reps.
598645	602968	I just say that a lot of times, unfortunately, their hands are a little tied in what they can and can't do.
602988	605310	There's certain processes, procedures, rules in place.
605330	606731	There's only so much they can do.
606771	609553	And they'll do whatever it takes for the people on the line.
609613	613677	But again, I don't work in the video game industry either, and neither do you.
613717	619802	And I think our industries give us a lot more leeway in those types of freedoms than a video game company.
620042	620542	You know what I mean?
620763	621043	Mm-hmm.
621763	629647	It's a little easier for you to investigate alone or my people to get claims paid that need to be or whatever than to fix a game.
629787	630368	You know what I mean?
631448	632229	I don't know if that makes sense.
632489	634770	I don't know.
634990	636811	I just think in their world it's a lot more limiting.
638332	643254	Hey, if you work in that world and care to disagree with us, you can always send us an email.
643274	644435	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
645000	648821	Yeah, I would actually like to know how video game customer support goes.
649522	652503	I'd actually like to hear more about that too.
652783	656764	I still think that there's way too many parallels from one to the other.
657225	665148	And I've talked to people who've done tech support that there's ways to get the help and ways to get the official answer.
665888	666028	So...
667162	668183	All right, let's move on.
668203	669644	We got to talk about our gaming weeks.
669824	673886	And usually we start off each of us talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week.
673986	675667	But I want to deviate a little bit tonight.
675747	683372	I'm actually going to let Loki start tonight because he checked out a game that I think a lot of our longtime listeners are going to be interested in because it's a music-based game.
683733	685734	He kind of got a sneak preview at this.
686334	691638	I have not heard a lot about this game outside of this show, but I don't know.
691698	693639	Loki, does it look to be something I should be keeping an eye on?
694039	694820	Yes, definitely.
695340	696320	It's a brand new game.
696781	703065	A lot of people may be familiar with DJ Hero, which is supposed to be coming out from Activision later this year.
704125	707727	There was another music game that's also turntable-based that's going to be...
709346	710086	Scratch, The Ultimate DJ
737802	745643	Now what this game is, what makes it kind of unique, is the game relies a lot on actual turntable techniques.
747267	748368	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
768897	769677	and so on.
786707	787347	and so on.
812522	816525	It's actually a turntable that looks like a Numark turntable.
817145	829092	Then you've got five keys next to it, kind of like a Beatmania arcade-style controller, except they're all in a line, kind of like the Guitar Hero fret buttons, but a lot bigger and kind of nicer looking.
829711	832493	and next to that is actually a crossfader.
833053	847562	So during those sections that you can scratch in, you can actually do real turntable techniques with it and the game will pick up on that and award you points and award you saying, okay, you did this, this, and this.
848703	849003	DarkSakura.com
866520	869322	So yeah, right now it's set to come out in June.
869722	870962	It's going to be about $100 retail.
871863	873664	And PlayStation 3 and 360.
873964	875424	It looks pretty awesome.
875524	878246	It's pretty much everything you would expect from Beatmania.
879346	880787	The controllers, ambidextrous.
882867	884288	They're going to have like 60 songs.
884868	889010	It's licensed hip-hop and R&B, which may not be for everybody.
890150	895232	That kind of turned me off of it at first until I actually saw it being played, and it's pretty cool.
896212	907977	Some of the tracks that I think they have confirmed for it so far, like Flashing Lights by Kanye West, Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas, Peter Piper by Run DMC.
907997	908257	Woo-hoo!
908937	925720	Hot in Here by Nelly, Milkshake by Killis, Friends by Houdini, Party Like a Rockstar by Shopboys, and Don't Sweat the Technique by Aaron B and Ray Kim.
926982	936107	So basically, you're talking about a game, it looks like Beatmania, and a question coming from our chat is, GS68 is making the Konami will sue joke.
936467	940710	Do you think it's going to be something that's too close to comfort for Konami?
940830	949075	Their controller is different enough, I don't know if they can sue them because of the controller, since it's not just, the way it functions is a little bit different.
950615	953776	Also, the interface itself is different than Beatmania.
954716	969779	The way the screen looks, it's almost like a candy cane, I guess, because kind of towards the left side of the screen, you'll see like a turntable spinning, and the notes come off the turntable, and they kind of turn around, and then they come down like Beatmania would.
970399	973659	But, I mean, it's similar in the way it's played, but I don't know.
973760	976040	I mean, I'm sure they'll try to sue them anyways, but...
977560	983303	Part of the way you described it, though, makes me think that Beatmania and Kraken DJ spawned.
984163	987544	Yeah, with the whole crossfader and everything, it does kind of sound like it's a mix of them.
987724	990846	And the scratching, it's like a love baby of the two.
991546	993007	But no techno.
993027	1001831	We have a lot of people in our chat who are in that Beatmania mindset, thinking like, oh, if this game's going to have a Beatmania-style controller, I see Acidic Vampire says, I want techno.
1001891	1002351	That's the thing.
1002411	1004672	Techno does not have scratching in it, usually.
1006451	1008352	That's why they basically stuck to hip-hop.
1008492	1009973	Could do, though, good drum and bass.
1011053	1013955	They could, and I don't see why they can't.
1014095	1023580	I mean, it's just that they're really focusing on music that's going to be scratchable, that you would hear scratching in.
1023700	1032965	Another cool thing about it is they're going to have a microphone port on it that you'll actually be able to sample yourself or whatever and mix it into the actual songs.
1034232	1035274	Oh, wiggity, wiggity, whack.
1035554	1038919	I could see myself yelling that in the microphone over and over.
1039380	1049174	And some other cool stuff they were saying, that they're going to have some sort of way to play back your performances or something, which is kind of cool.
1050916	1051296	HIP HOP MANIA
1079676	1081677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1101030	1101850	I don't know, it looks good.
1101911	1103231	I'd say definitely give it a shot.
1103251	1106833	There's going to be a lot more stuff coming out about it as it gets closer.
1106853	1108774	They're going to be really marketing this pretty heavily.
1109214	1111516	And I think it's going to be a really awesome game.
1111536	1115678	Because when you consider... Now, because I kept asking about DJ Hero and stuff like that.
1116398	1124583	The difference between them and DJ Hero is DJ Hero is going to be more... Basically, the aim of the game is to mix two songs together.
1125023	1127344	Whereas this is actually about scratching.
1128065	1128325	So...
1129105	1129425	I don't know.
1129585	1131247	It looks pretty cool, though, so far.
1132688	1134189	Let me ask the chat room about this, though.
1134449	1137332	I'm going to ask a question to chat, and we'll read some of your responses in a minute.
1138433	1142696	Gil, because I know we have a lot of people that have been listening to us for a long time, so we have a lot of music game fans in chat.
1143276	1150582	Does this game interest you, even though the music may not be the type of music you're used to in these types of games?
1150602	1154666	Because I don't think we've had a real... I should say one that can be taken very seriously.
1154706	1155566	I mean, we've had the, what...
1156647	1158828	Move It To The Streets or whatever that game was called.
1158868	1160448	The Dance Battle or whatever.
1160808	1162768	And we had that one random Xbox Live Arcade game.
1163029	1170290	I'm talking about, you know, this sounds like it's going to be pretty... Chatroom, are you interested in this game even though it's going to be hip-hop and not techno?
1170910	1171311	Chatroom.
1171631	1174391	And I asked the same question to Jamie.
1174551	1175372	Is this of interest to you?
1178172	1178632	Not really.
1178692	1179573	I probably won't play it.
1179993	1181013	I mean, I'll probably check it out.
1181773	1184134	But I actually really didn't like Kraken DJ.
1185434	1185574	And...
1187392	1190213	I really have no interest in any of that music.
1191373	1201475	Except for the exception of the two pretty classic ones mentioned, Run DMC and Rakim.
1202596	1205216	But I really have no interest in that music at all.
1205817	1211198	I really have no interest in the hip-hop lifestyle, really.
1211978	1213558	I don't care for it.
1213959	1215599	I don't really have an interest in the game.
1216414	1227639	That's my big sticking point, too, is that, you know, it's like, you know, I have an appreciation for some of that, you know, like you say, like the classics and some of those and even the silly dance songs like Milkshake and stuff I get a kick out of.
1228039	1230020	Yeah, but I don't know.
1230060	1230760	I kind of worry.
1230780	1235262	$100 is a lot to ask, but I'll probably give it the benefit of the doubt.
1235543	1237183	I'm definitely interested in checking it out.
1237343	1244887	I really want to check it out because, you know, if the interface works well and it's put together well, that's when I think we need to lobby these people to do the techno one we want.
1244967	1245247	I don't know.
1245487	1248928	Well, I mean, and they're going to have... Not all of the music's going to be licensed.
1248968	1250189	I think some of it they're actually making.
1250229	1256952	So, very well, I don't see why they couldn't do, like, house music or something like that that would have, you know, scratching in it.
1257072	1257692	I mean, it's just...
1259033	1268238	I know that there can be some techno songs they could have scratching it, but you would normally not hear a techno artist, if you went to a club, scratching out stuff with it.
1268318	1269599	It just wouldn't make any sense.
1271540	1276242	And song lists are so critically important in music games, too.
1276302	1279064	Why didn't any of us buy Karaoke Revolution Country Edition?
1280077	1281997	The name of the game one more time, Loki?
1305322	1309663	All right, let me read some comments from chat, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks with DarkSakura in just a moment.
1310944	1312684	Again, I asked the chat room, are you interested in this game?
1312704	1317545	Does this game sound interesting to you, even though it's not the typical type of music you've seen in other music games that have come out here?
1318046	1319526	YYR says, yes, it does.
1320186	1322647	ActDeft says it does, but what's turning me off is the price.
1324327	1324848	Let's see.
1326528	1331291	Bocci Kawa says, personally, I play beat-bit games for the music, but I have a broad interest when it comes to music.
1331371	1331872	I'll play it.
1333032	1335874	YYR says, I would like spinning to music that we could actually hear in a club.
1336314	1338736	Tiger Class says, probably not, because I don't listen to hip-hop.
1341057	1345080	Biohaze says, I would only be interested if you could load music from your hard drive and play it from that.
1345140	1346261	Otherwise, not interested.
1346621	1348382	Frisbee says, simply, no, not interested.
1348702	1352665	DarkTetsuya said, yeah, if they had an in-store demo or something, I'd at least try it once.
1353545	1353626	Um...
1354466	1355827	Leo Shen says, not really.
1355867	1357267	Songs kill it for me, to be honest.
1357807	1359948	Acidic Vampire says, I agree with Dark Tetsuya.
1360068	1364871	I'd have to try it out first before I can judge it, but I'm not really into hip hop, but it could be fun.
1365191	1368592	Misty says, I'd probably get it eventually when I can eBay it for like half price.
1368952	1370793	Milkshake is an in-joke bonus for me.
1371273	1371673	There you go.
1371814	1375555	Two words would actually, two words would swing it a little bit for me.
1376195	1376836	Beastie Boys.
1377856	1378776	How about 9-1-1 is a joke?
1380356	1382157	That's some old school public enemy.
1382177	1386298	Well, I mean, there's going to be like 40 some songs and that's only like six of them.
1386478	1388159	I mean, like I said, it's five months away.
1389559	1392040	And we don't even know anything about like DJ Hero.
1392060	1394681	I mean, that game could be completely lame.
1394761	1402104	Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be much different other than exchanging out a turntable for the guitar controller.
1403389	1404830	We're very interested to see what develops.
1404870	1406251	We definitely have an eye on this game.
1406632	1411876	Meanwhile, let's move on and talk about games we've had our eyes on this week, or in DarkSakura's case, the past two weeks.
1411956	1412576	How was your gaming week?
1413457	1416439	Actually, it was pretty bare because I started school this week.
1417520	1420562	I pretty much just played some Fable and a little Ragnarok and that was it.
1421323	1425166	I just really have not had a whole lot of time to play much of anything else.
1426867	1428108	School does that, doesn't it?
1428749	1433070	Oh, I played some Katamari on my phone, but I kept getting interrupted, so I haven't gotten past the first stage.
1433891	1435491	And lots of solitaire.
1436512	1436812	Awesome.
1438512	1438872	Loki.
1439173	1439933	And I finished a book.
1440593	1440993	What's that?
1441333	1442534	V, The Second Generation.
1442694	1443274	How was that?
1443454	1444934	That was freaking amazing.
1444954	1447235	You've talked a lot about V. Book review.
1447315	1447915	Okay, quick.
1447995	1449256	For those that don't know what V is...
1450032	1459377	V, it was a series that came on in the early 80s about these visitors from outer space who came trying to be, you know, on the surface they were friendly.
1459417	1462119	It turned out they're trying to steal all of our water and eat everybody.
1462759	1464340	And they were really lizard people underneath.
1464540	1465861	And you can actually rent the DVDs.
1466761	1474405	But the creator of the first series did not like how they continued the series when they did the TV series in V, The Final Battle.
1474945	1477807	So he actually wrote a book about
1477987	1501706	about what the world would be like 20 years after what he envisioned going on happened and it's it's like watching it reads like watching the episodes it's very very visual and you know in far as how it's been in the description and it's just a fantastic book so if anyone's a fan of V get the book just get it get it get it and yes Robert England was in V he was in there as Willie and that character is in the book
1502878	1504759	That was a question from our chatroom, AsceticVampire.
1505179	1505920	Very nice.
1506660	1508461	Who knew that you were going to get a book review?
1508661	1511222	I'm fucking literal, okay?
1512083	1512823	I love reading.
1513023	1514624	Books are fun.
1515125	1516185	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1516325	1517666	Books are fundamental.
1518146	1519207	Books are fun to burn.
1520307	1520688	Just kidding.
1521088	1524129	How was your gaming week, Loki, outside of scratch?
1524490	1525050	Not very well.
1525150	1526691	It's just a grant the thought of forth.
1526771	1527631	That's basically it.
1527971	1528892	Just played it at work.
1529052	1530593	But not on your PC.
1531293	1558377	yeah most definitely not on my PC yeah that's basically it unfortunately I wanted to play some other things I keep trying to go back to Fable 2 and I really need to finish and there's no way I'm going to finish it in time Lost Odyssey because god damn it if Star Ocean is not coming out in like a month from now I'm not going to ever finish Lost Odyssey
1559761	1561446	I didn't know you were a big Star Ocean fan.
1561466	1563572	I'm not a big Star Ocean fan, but it looks awesome.
1564595	1566440	I've not played any of the Star Ocean games.
1568275	1569196	The first one was okay.
1569556	1570296	I didn't finish it.
1570776	1573458	I guess I'm the only one that actually played quite a few games this week.
1574358	1578320	Well, actually, I shouldn't say that because I pretty much spent all of my gaming time on one game.
1578340	1586463	But I actually spent a lot of time, like for me, a large amount of time on Fable 2, which is kind of one of those games I meant to check out last year.
1586543	1588204	But, you know, the holidays are so busy.
1588524	1591425	There were some games I said, look, I'm not going to get to these games until January, February.
1591725	1593666	Loki was good enough to loan me a copy of Fable 2.
1594446	1595587	A legit copy.
1595788	1596108	Thank you.
1596268	1598511	Based on what we talked about earlier in the show, this was a legit copy.
1600713	1601454	It's a lot of fun.
1601774	1603796	I'm having way more fun with this one than I did the first game.
1603816	1604317	Are you being evil?
1605213	1605533	DarkSakura.com
1628903	1642913	and how Nintendo is going to be putting this, you know, they patented, I should say, not necessarily putting this in, but patenting this mode where you're going to be able to just, at a touch of a button, get little videos that help you with the game and even just skip right over certain parts of the game or watch them played for you.
1643153	1645055	It's like basically turning games into movies or whatever.
1645395	1648818	And Loki was very vehemently, like, against this, saying, like, I'm not going to buy the game.
1649118	1650359	But what struck me as funny
1651239	1653502	Fable 2 is almost one step away from that.
1653963	1659129	Because that little gold path really makes it easy to know where to go.
1659290	1661212	But you have the option of turning it off.
1661512	1662053	That is true.
1662133	1662934	You can turn it off.
1662954	1665658	And you can also turn this other thing off we were talking about last week.
1666668	1670590	Until I learned the world well enough, I actually kind of needed it.
1670650	1675632	Oh, I still definitely need it, but I veer from the path all the time because I'm always afraid I'm going to miss treasures.
1676092	1686136	But the fantastic thing about this game is it reminds me a lot of Oblivion, which is a game I really loved because there was just like an open world, do whatever you want, go wherever type of thing.
1686576	1694820	But, you know, it has that multiplayer aspect to it, and it's kind of in a much different art style, a much different presentation.
1695432	1697215	Well, the most important question about this, Rob.
1697535	1698276	What'd you name your dog?
1699198	1699799	Wienerschnitzel.
1700320	1701282	I named mine Dumbass.
1701762	1702083	Did you?
1702764	1704527	Because the dog is stupid.
1705369	1706410	Bark, bark, bark!
1706811	1707091	What?
1707152	1708915	I already got that treasure box, stupid!
1709929	1718832	But I don't know, I'm having a lot of fun with the game, just kind of running around and doing stuff and dancing for villagers and trying to get people to marry me, although it hasn't been successful so far.
1719193	1720813	I guess I'm just not dancing enough, or what?
1721553	1722954	There's something that you need to do, Rob.
1723674	1727176	An achievement that you need to unlock, and this is one that Tiara told me about.
1727296	1727596	Okay.
1728236	1737440	When you get the pelvic thrust emote, then you need to go to the sheriff in the marketplace, strip naked...
1738840	1741928	Target him and do the pelvic thrust What happens?
1741948	1743452	Do you get thrown in jail for loot?
1743492	1746399	You find a thousand gold and you get an achievement for it
1748066	1748466	DarkSakura.com
1770148	1771749	Yeah, the game's very adult.
1771889	1773289	You can get the polygamist.
1773429	1777791	I searched the drawers in one house, the cabinet or whatever, and I found a condom.
1778111	1781312	I was like, wow, this game's kind of adult nature.
1781332	1784053	I dug a hole in the ground and found condoms, okay?
1784073	1785333	It's so stupid.
1785353	1786594	I was like, I don't want this.
1786894	1786974	Ew.
1786994	1788655	Who would bury condoms in the ground?
1788675	1788855	Goddammit.
1788875	1789935	Dumbass the dog.
1791336	1793276	Wow, dumbass the condom-sniffing dog.
1793316	1793797	Amazing.
1794377	1794797	That's it.
1795057	1796918	We have to do a Fable webcomic.
1800029	1804312	The Adventures of Little Sparrow and Dumbass the Dog.
1804672	1808274	Although I'm going by Master Chief because I have the special edition.
1809055	1811557	But yeah, I've just been having fun just kind of messing around.
1811657	1815219	The one thing I noticed about Fable 2, your character never has to sleep.
1816059	1816600	Like, ever.
1818755	1819896	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1839934	1843255	Right now my character needs to seriously buy a lot of celery.
1844115	1844615	For what?
1844735	1846916	Because she's been eating meat pie.
1847696	1849116	And she's a little chubby.
1851177	1857119	Actdeft in chat says, VGCats beat you to that webcomic idea and link to VGCats recent edition.
1857139	1858619	I'll have to look at that a little later.
1861121	1868566	The rest of my gaming week, I have some news that might come as a bit of a shock to some of our regular listeners.
1869767	1873150	I made a conscious decision this morning to cancel my World of Warcraft account.
1875180	1876441	Why are you applauding that?
1876801	1877402	Don't be mean.
1877422	1879223	We'll see how long it lasts.
1879983	1880664	She's skeptic.
1881144	1883586	No, but just, yeah.
1884727	1885327	I canceled it.
1885727	1886548	I don't need to say much more.
1887589	1888809	Nothing anybody did in-game.
1889230	1890731	No drama, nothing like that.
1890771	1893673	But just kind of the thing that it really was starting to feel like.
1893933	1896334	Even I was starting to go, I'm playing this game too much.
1896955	1898536	So I pulled the plug.
1899196	1899857	Because I can do that.
1899957	1902038	I have enough self-control where I can do that.
1902959	1903699	I might not have much.
1904773	1908474	but I had enough where I was finally just able to recognize, you know what, I'm starting to treat this like a second job.
1908834	1909554	I need to step away.
1911335	1913535	I need to level up in real life for a little while.
1914716	1915836	That's my big shocking news.
1915876	1917116	Yeah, we'll see how long it lasts.
1917836	1918156	I know.
1918537	1919197	Be skeptical.
1919237	1919697	It's fine.
1919897	1920377	I deserve it.
1920937	1923438	Especially after quitting and going back to Final Fantasy XI.
1923658	1927079	But I do want to make it clear, I did not quit World of Warcraft to go back to Final Fantasy XI.
1928115	1935821	I can safely say I have had lulls, but I'm still playing Ragnarok online after eight years.
1935941	1936922	Nine years, sorry.
1937002	1937363	You know what?
1937483	1943708	And now that I'm finally done with WoW for the foreseeable future, I should actually go check out Ragnarok for a little bit.
1944008	1945089	But I also, here's the problem.
1945209	1947871	I don't want to ditch one MMO and then just go play another MMO.
1947991	1952195	The good thing about Ragnarok, though, is it really, especially if you play on a private server, it's just like, oh, whatever.
1952775	1953015	Yeah.
1953576	1954196	Okay, I'll do this.
1954276	1954657	Okay, I'm done.
1955787	1957580	It's not like, oh, grind!
1957822	1957902	Ah!
1958948	1965232	Oh, actually, Rob, I'll tell you what, I'm actually going to be joining another private server for a different game.
1965893	1968935	We are starting VOL Army on Phantasy Star Online.
1969375	1969776	Really?
1969936	1970977	Another blue burst server.
1971597	1972498	Are those still around?
1972738	1977521	They are, and they have all the Japanese quest updates, and people are translating them.
1977661	1978061	Weird.
1978382	1980363	Is it official, or is it all under the table bootleg stuff?
1980383	1981924	It's all under the table, but Sega don't care.
1982725	1985367	Sega was actually letting you transfer some of your characters over.
1986249	1990571	I really liked Phantasy Star Online, and you don't get that immersed in that, you know what I mean?
1990671	1994752	Yeah, it's something that you can sit and play through a little bit.
1994772	1997373	You can play it all day if you want to, you can play it a little bit if you want to.
1998133	2001234	And you can also kick rappies, which is fantastic.
2001274	2001835	I hate rappies.
2002695	2003855	So, you should do that.
2004576	2007417	Alright, SSJ100Matt suggesting I go back to DDR.
2007557	2011378	Actually, I would love to play DDR, but they don't really have a machine around here.
2012130	2012630	We should play.
2040268	2041529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2051542	2052263	A new little game.
2052303	2055204	It's called Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
2055565	2057126	And it's like a DDR clone thing.
2057146	2060648	I believe it's like an expansion you actually load into Step Mania or something like that.
2061128	2065291	Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix, the demo or what have you, was released.
2065771	2067232	And you can load it into Step Mania.
2067512	2071675	It's all these in-jokes from Orange Lounge Radio, but now in DDR.
2071755	2074076	Like they have Still Alive as one of the songs.
2074477	2078179	And then, I don't know, some recording of me singing a DDR song from like
2078559	2078819	What?
2078859	2078979	What?
2100888	2101809	My people.
2101909	2102189	My people.
2102229	2102589	My people.
2130365	2130925	Alright, anyhow.
2132066	2133907	Let's go ahead and get into gaming news.
2133947	2135428	We haven't talked anything about gaming news yet.
2135469	2136950	Let's please get into that.
2137370	2137570	What?
2139231	2140892	Oh yeah, we touched scratch.
2140912	2143034	That was more of like a gaming exclusive.
2143434	2145775	Let's get into the news that you read everywhere else on the internet now.
2147914	2157502	Of course, we are big fans of Katamari and Takahashi's brand new game, Nobi Nobi Boy, which I still don't know what exactly you have to do in this.
2157602	2160204	But ironically, Katamari is not fans of us.
2160824	2161185	Yes.
2163126	2163947	How I forget.
2164027	2165428	How 2006 of me, I know.
2165688	2166609	I know.
2167149	2172273	Anyways, Nobi Nobi Boy will be available on the PlayStation Network February 19th.
2172854	2174235	It is coming out at a whopping $5.
2174275	2174455	Yeah.
2176055	2177175	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2203140	2204661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2221562	2231989	All the combined, basically everybody in the world that's playing this game contributes to her getting longer and after she gets so long, it unlocks a new level for you.
2232470	2235212	So everybody is kind of working to unlock new levels.
2235812	2236833	That's just a cute idea.
2237133	2238434	The world, the clouds look like tasty fluffy donuts.
2238454	2239675	Don't talk about food, you're gonna make me hungry.
2265199	2268140	Are they talking about releasing a demo or anything so I can at least try this game out?
2268160	2274421	Or am I just going to have to basically throw $5 into the wind and hope that just because it has the Katamari guy's name on it, it's cool?
2274761	2278422	There's no mention of a demo at all, but most of the PSN games do get demos.
2278882	2280723	Some do not, but most of them do.
2280843	2283703	Whatever happened to him making childhood playground equipment?
2283803	2284504	I think he has.
2285004	2285344	Interesting.
2286404	2296755	And you know, I don't want to know what his playground equipment looks like since he always comes up with these crazy things that eat things and roll over things and absorb them.
2296936	2297817	Probably kind of scary.
2297917	2301481	It's like Takahashi's Borg playground equipment.
2301561	2302382	Become one.
2302502	2304244	Assimilate into the playground equipment.
2305407	2309431	Well, also on PlayStation Network, LittleBigPlanet has not released anything in a little while.
2310332	2314476	They had that big Metal Gear Solid thing right before Christmas, and they were kind of on holiday break.
2314496	2320682	But they are coming back, apparently, on January 26th, I believe, which is tomorrow?
2321994	2323436	I think that might be over in the UK, I don't know.
2323456	2329084	But basically as of this next week, you're going to start to see some new costumes show up on the PlayStation Network.
2329424	2331247	It starts with the Chinese New Year costumes.
2331327	2332349	Oh, I see.
2333370	2334852	They come out on January 26th.
2334872	2336415	The rest of the costumes go with the regular updates.
2336735	2338896	The cool thing is the Chinese New Year costumes are going to be free.
2339736	2349379	They haven't said exactly how much the other packs are going to cost, including a Groundhog Day costume, a Valentine's Day mini pack, an Ape Escape costume, and a Toro costume.
2349619	2350839	Both of which are from Japan.
2350999	2352460	And a Wipeout costume kit.
2353140	2353961	Which is kind of interesting.
2354301	2362606	But what I also thought was, and caught my eye, was on January 29th, with the Groundhog Day costume, a God of War mini-pack is coming out with a Kratos costume.
2362626	2366889	And I don't know if that means a God of War level thing, which it sounds like it might be.
2367169	2371552	That would be the download content that was available if you pre-ordered the game at GameStop.
2371572	2372573	That's the other thing I'm wondering.
2372593	2375835	Or is it just the... I got one of those.
2375875	2378137	Even though I didn't pre-order the game, they gave me the slip anyway.
2378257	2379277	It was only a costume.
2379317	2380518	It wasn't a lot of other stuff.
2380818	2383040	There were stickers also that were with it, I think.
2383360	2384461	Maybe there were, I just don't remember.
2384481	2390587	Because remember the big controversy was someone made a God of War level with those stickers and it got banned from there?
2391088	2395692	Well then if that's coming out, where's the Heavenly Sword and all the other stuff that was supposed to come out too?
2395992	2396713	That's my other question.
2397093	2398194	Well, later.
2400176	2400617	I guess so.
2401117	2404380	But I guess this would be a sign for those that got frustrated because they didn't get the pre-order bundle.
2404721	2407884	They will be able to get the content, although you can bet you it's going to cost money.
2408857	2410880	You can betcha it'll cost money.
2411300	2412302	Especially in this economy.
2412362	2413764	They gotta make money wherever they can, right?
2414204	2414725	I guess so.
2415266	2417129	But, you know, money is...
2418447	2418867	Wonderful.
2421468	2425429	I was going to say running short and the recession is hitting.
2426509	2428429	It's really on a worldwide basis.
2428449	2441612	Eidos closed their Manchester studio so that they can do just the big name games instead of developing smaller ones.
2441632	2447774	They want to put as high quality titles that will deliver long term franchise value.
2448334	2466933	whatever um so basically it's just 14 people and all they did was make mobile games um but still for those 14 people you know and there's been a lot of you know just cutback news across the industries every week we're reporting on something and you know uh
2467293	2493881	I know when we were doing the call earlier with Bobby Blackwolf from the show before us you know he's been joking about how his show is just one it's been one downer after another not you know because it's bad content but just the news has just been layoff layoff layoff and then even you know what I don't know if you guys know this I think we talked about a little on the show last week but there was the Gamerscore blog at Xbox site that you know they did a lot for the community and in fact they were a big reason why
2494221	2494642	That's just... eugh.
2505839	2516605	It's especially kind of, ooh, kind of hits you right in the gut when some of these people were famous for the podcasts and vidcasts that they had developed that caught Microsoft's eye and hired them on.
2516645	2519186	And some of them had relocated themselves out there.
2519687	2523188	And unfortunately, the world works in mysterious ways.
2524400	2525221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2543255	2556300	Although, you know, are getting laid off and stuff, hopefully when things settle down and the economy starts to come back, because what goes down must go back up eventually, people are going to find something they really, really like and hopefully it won't be such a bad thing.
2557060	2560702	So that's my little philosophical moment for the day.
2560822	2565483	Sorry to be Miss Sunshine, but you know, I'm just a ray of freaking sunshine today, aren't I?
2565783	2566684	You're pooping rainbows.
2568672	2570554	Somehow I don't think I'd be welcomed in your cult.
2571615	2572176	Pooping rainbows.
2572196	2573778	Sure, you can poop some rainbows in my cult.
2574218	2574498	Right.
2575379	2575960	That's what I'll do.
2576000	2578743	Bob is the high priest of rainbow poop.
2581546	2583348	Well, you make it sound so dignified.
2583949	2584750	Alright, anyway.
2585330	2586772	Sorry to those 14 folks.
2587252	2588554	Hopefully they'll bounce back eventually.
2589076	2589236	Yeah.
2589916	2596320	Well, in other fun news, there's another PSP firmware update.
2596860	2598161	Hooray!
2599322	2610448	You may remember there was an exploit that was recently discovered using GripShift that would allow people to run homebrew on a PSP 3000 system.
2611228	2613109	Well, you can imagine that this new...
2615951	2643423	5.03 firmware addresses security vulnerabilities and basically it's layman's terms for we fixed the grip shift exploit now you can't do it anymore so if you want to run homebrew onto your you know PSP 3000 I suggest that you don't update your system yet and just wait for them to find another way the few more days before they figure out a way to put a custom firmware onto the PSP 3000 and then it won't matter how many days has it been since this came out
2644591	2646112	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2674329	2681372	Then, you know, any other updates like, say, a 5.1 or 5.2 or something like that that change a few things, add a couple features.
2681672	2688235	Those they can incorporate pretty easy because they normally don't change the firmware too much from update to update.
2688275	2691557	They're just adding different things or updating different PRXs and stuff.
2692654	2695135	There's a countdown that everyone thought that was Zelda.
2717942	2719505	Oh, okay, I see.
2719625	2731165	Well, what it is, it actually ends up being a game that 30 plays a significant thing in the game because you play four different games, but you play them 30 seconds apiece.
2732239	2749467	each of the four games has their own character, their own mode like one of them is a side scroller, one of them is a shooter one of them is a strategy game and one of them is an action game but you play them 30 seconds at a time and there's I guess some type of clock in the middle of the screen and then after the 30 seconds is up you go to another mini game
2750876	2757343	I don't know, but a game like WarioWare that's made up of nothing but 30 second games is actually kind of cool.
2757783	2760286	So this could be very interesting.
2760366	2760766	I don't know.
2761287	2762768	It's very Japan.
2763769	2765071	But I wonder if they'll bring it over here.
2765852	2766933	Looks like it could be kind of cool.
2768241	2770342	GameGuru says so it's WarioWare with less games.
2770662	2771663	I don't know, not necessarily.
2772843	2778085	It could be that the mini-games are all different types of side-scrolling games, different types of shooting games.
2778505	2782747	But I would say it's like a WarioWare meets an RPG, like Actdeft says.
2783047	2784148	Sounds a little bit like it.
2784308	2784608	I don't know.
2785128	2787369	It'll be hard to say until I can actually play the game, right?
2788029	2788870	So, we'll see.
2789690	2791050	That'll be coming out eventually.
2792491	2794352	Well, here's something for...
2795416	2798204	Rumor mill, if we don't mind.
2798284	2799627	Actually, I'm sorry, that's not a rumor mill.
2801091	2802174	I was looking at the wrong story.
2803899	2804240	Well, no.
2805802	2807883	I'm just pissed off over my USB gloves.
2808704	2809564	They're not warming up.
2810445	2811805	I have USB handwarming gloves.
2811925	2814307	How exactly hot can USB handwarming gloves get?
2814327	2818509	They get freaking hot because I've got the cheap shitty ones that don't have any padding on the inside.
2818549	2820770	So it's like, I'm going to burn your palms now.
2822411	2826373	So I have to use them with my USB hub and they don't get as hot using my hub.
2826533	2829075	Anyway, so how about some Wipeout Love?
2829875	2830376	Wipeout
2843829	2873219	The PSP, as you know, just want to PS2 PS2, sorry Bringing Wipeout to PS2 It's actually got the information from a European release list So, hey, maybe that could be it It's actually Wipeout Pulse, sorry And also, other things on that particular list One of them is Fat Princess to be out in March I really don't know
2873932	2876314	Wipeout Pulse is the PSP going to the PS2?
2876334	2876835	That makes sense then.
2898351	2899572	Alright, well, we'll see.
2899612	2900693	I mean, I like the Wipeout games.
2900733	2902215	I have the download one.
2902555	2903656	I have the NegCon.
2904617	2906759	I'm glad to have another reason to use it.
2910400	2913781	Well, there's some other games coming out in case you can't wait until March.
2914662	2922684	This week there's a few games starting off with MLB Front Office Manager on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.
2923744	2927045	Kind of the baseball take on NFL Head Coach.
2928165	2933847	Also on PS3 and Xbox 360, Afro Samurai coming to us from Namco Bandai.
2935167	2935908	Looks pretty cool.
2936188	2937048	Very bloody.
2938428	2962861	movie tie-in game Coraline coming out on the Wii and PS2 I don't think there's a DS for that looks okay on DS, Imagine Cheerleader yet another game geared towards girls and then kind of a neat little DS game The Chase, Felix meets Felicity this is supposed to play a little bit like Kirby's Canvas Curse
2963781	2964821	DJ Max Fever on PSP this week
2994455	3011809	and some games that people are not waiting for JoJo's Fashion Show for the DS and Pets Horses Ranch on DS as well and also supposedly this week although I think it's next week Rygar the Battle of Argus on the Wii
3012589	3013549	And that is it.
3039241	3040021	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3056067	3057548	And I don't recognize any of these songs.
3057668	3061091	I realize DJ Max fans recognize these songs in the Korean version of the game.
3061291	3062572	But they already import the Korean version.
3062592	3067435	You have to understand, you are like the minority of the minority of the minority of video game buyers.
3067836	3068216	Okay?
3068756	3073860	Like, the rest of those people, what is going to be the incentive for them to buy this game?
3074841	3075321	You know what I mean?
3075481	3076302	There is no incentive.
3077743	3079204	And I know, and some people scoff.
3079304	3081246	What, licensed songs in DJ Max?
3081726	3083547	Well, do they want to sell it or not?
3083807	3084048	I mean...
3086010	3092832	I'm kind of surprised that with them trying to put out this game in the US, they don't want to give me something I would know.
3094152	3104354	Again, I respect DJ Max, I understand why he has such a loyal following and all that stuff, but they're not going to win over any new people with this strategy.
3104494	3105135	Does that make sense?
3105415	3105575	Yeah.
3109107	3109707	I guess that's just me.
3111448	3115229	Oh, I just like to add before you start Japanese release dates.
3115569	3117429	And this kind of ties in with Japanese release dates.
3118149	3122931	I pre-ordered the Blu-ray of Advent Children.
3123491	3125411	The one with Final Fantasy XIII.
3125671	3126311	The demo.
3127112	3129452	And I'm having that bitch overnighted when it comes out.
3129772	3130432	Nice.
3130492	3131253	When does that come out?
3131513	3131813	April.
3131833	3133393	That's going to be awesome.
3134433	3136434	We will have Final Fantasy...
3136974	3137314	DarkSakura.com
3153068	3154549	I think he did Saw 2 and 3 and all that.
3154629	3155749	I think those movies are kind of dumb.
3156209	3158010	But this movie was awesome.
3158190	3163252	It's like a 70s glam rock, but it's like an opera and it's a horror movie.
3163592	3164072	It's amazing.
3164253	3166954	Anyway, I just wanted to say that because you saying Blu-ray reminded me of that.
3167574	3168454	Comments from chat.
3169274	3170635	I went on that thing about DJ Max.
3171335	3173536	GS68, who I know is a big DJ Max fan.
3173796	3177018	He called and did the review on the arcade version before on the show.
3177378	3178878	GS68 says, it's DJ Max.
3178958	3180139	I don't expect licensed song.
3180922	3183604	Yeah, I know you don't, but again, you're the minority.
3183904	3185285	Surely you understand that.
3185625	3199073	It's just like back in the day, there weren't that many licensed songs in DDR, whereas fans of DDR didn't care if they brought out a DDR game over here that had no licensed songs, just all Konami artists.
3199954	3206638	If you're trying to expand your audience or bring it over to basically introduce people that haven't played,
3207695	3208356	DJ Maxx.
3208416	3211340	It's easier to do that with songs that they may recognize.
3211380	3213522	They can go, hey, oh, this is in there.
3213582	3214263	I can play this.
3215044	3217547	Now, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be successful.
3217587	3222953	I mean, look at Beatmania, which tried to do that as well, and that didn't work out too well.
3223093	3224715	So, I don't know.
3227472	3236018	Well, okay, but the thing is, though, that, you know, again, DDR didn't really gain steam here until well into the PlayStation 2 mixes.
3236098	3236518	You know what I mean?
3236538	3240561	Like, we had that first mix on PlayStation, which was, you know, even the fans laughed at it.
3240901	3244083	Konomics, which was basically fan service, nothing but.
3244463	3248266	Then we started getting into, like, you know, DDR Max on the PlayStation 2.
3248966	3254990	And then really, I think probably about Max 2 was when we really started to see, like, a lot more licensed songs in the U.S.
3255030	3255571	DDR games.
3255851	3257392	And that's also when the game took off.
3258413	3259254	Really took off.
3259754	3262076	You know, the first few games showed that it was probable.
3262436	3264418	Maybe the same thing will happen with DJ Max.
3264878	3265199	I don't know.
3265659	3266480	But we'll see.
3267180	3267721	Anyway, sorry.
3268422	3274227	I think if anything, what will help DJ Max will be DJ Max Technica when it comes out on the DS.
3274627	3276268	And if they decide to bring that over here.
3276869	3279711	Because there's a lot more people that play the DS and...
3280472	3281933	Ninja Blade on the Xbox 360 January 29th
3301152	3301652	It's pretty fun.
3301853	3305975	As well as Tom Clancy's End War and Tomb Raider Underworld come out on the Xbox 360.
3306375	3313340	Heading over to the PlayStation 3, Tomb Raider Underworld also shows up in Japan, as well as Lost Planet Extreme Condition getting a price reduction.
3313760	3315001	Again, that's in Japan.
3315861	3320144	Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time.
3320204	3322586	I anticipate there'll probably be a few people who'll want to import that sucker.
3323466	3325688	That finally shows up on the Nintendo Wii.
3325748	3326848	It's been forever.
3327068	3329190	Wasn't Crystal Chronicles supposed to be a launch game?
3330177	3331157	Yeah.
3331498	3333198	And then it's kind of changed quite a bit.
3333859	3341582	On the PlayStation 2, hey, funny, wouldn't you know it, Dance Dance Revolution X gets its debut in Japan this week on the PlayStation 2.
3342142	3344904	And the Japanese versions are always better somehow.
3345104	3349106	AR Tenelico 2, Melody of Metaphalica Premium Edition comes out.
3349846	3351767	See, you didn't butcher that like I did last week.
3352407	3352627	What?
3353048	3356010	I said he didn't butcher that like I did last week.
3356050	3356370	Oh, sorry.
3357231	3361193	Soul Eater Battle Resonance comes out in Japan.
3361213	3361634	Do you want?
3362574	3363515	What is this game all about?
3364015	3366117	It's based off of a manga that's pretty hardcore cool.
3366457	3366837	Cool.
3366897	3368098	Trying to build the ultimate weapon.
3369659	3374763	Also a game called Harukanaro Toki no Naka de Yumi no Kuhihashi comes out.
3374803	3376704	Special comes out as well.
3376744	3379987	I have no idea, but that's from Koei, so I bet anything it's some type of RPG game.
3382661	3387024	It was previously released on the Nintendo DS to celebrate Koei's 30th anniversary.
3388064	3391927	Some more scenes that now have voiced and all that, so it's a DS game upgrade.
3393048	3398291	On the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time also gets its release on the DS this week in Japan.
3398751	3405476	Civilization Revolution gets a localized release for Japan, as well as a game called Vampire Kishi DS comes out from D3.
3406136	3409518	Sims 2 gets a price reduction over in Japan, if you haven't checked that out yet and you want to.
3410879	3421867	and lastly on the Sony PSP, Memories Off number 5, Togireta Film comes out as well as Princess Maker 4 Portable gets a price reduction.
3422387	3431353	But probably the price reduction you're more interested in is Rockman Dash and Rockman Dash 2 coming out together in a value pack this week in Japan.
3431794	3439039	Also, by the way, actually a couple other games, Soul Eater Battle Resonance gets released on the PSP and Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2.
3441089	3442750	There you have it, your Japanese release dates.
3443371	3448134	Let's move on over to the kingdom that is united.
3448994	3449495	The UK.
3451676	3451896	Yes.
3453277	3454878	Actually, really not a whole lot of anything.
3454958	3456219	Two games on the 30th.
3456259	3460322	Cake Mania 2 and The Chase Felix Meets Felicity.
3462123	3463004	Cake Mania.
3464425	3465946	And Felix Meets Felicity.
3466366	3467507	These sound like real winners.
3467527	3467587	Yes.
3468737	3469558	Chase is supposed to be pretty good.
3469578	3470299	If it's Felix the cat.
3470779	3472201	No, it's the Chase.
3472281	3473863	It's that one that's coming out in the US also.
3474043	3474864	It looked okay.
3475504	3478488	It's different, but is different appreciated?
3478668	3479088	Not always.
3479108	3480190	I don't know.
3480510	3481271	Alright, there you have it.
3481491	3482212	UK release dates.
3483649	3486831	Something else that might be appreciated is the new PopCap game, Peggle.
3487011	3490013	Well, it's not that new, but it's new to Xbox Live Arcade.
3490033	3496437	It's supposed to be coming out in the first half of 2009, if I were to guess, probably March, since I think that's when the DS version comes out.
3496718	3504703	And that's also when the new PopCap Arcade hits, Volume 2, which also features Peggle.
3505023	3507405	So it makes sense that it would come out before that.
3509093	3509534	Ha ha.
3509874	3510174	Hmm.
3510355	3511236	There's logic for you.
3512357	3513879	No word on what the price is going to be.
3514219	3517383	Apparently people are thinking though that it's going to be 800 Microsoft points.
3517483	3520827	Makes perfect sense because I think all the other PopCap games were also 10 bucks.
3520987	3523851	Did you hear about the leak on Twitter about the iPhone version of Peggle?
3525460	3526560	I don't think that's really a leak.
3526680	3538304	Yeah, I thought that news was kind of already out there, but apparently they made a tweet about the iPhone pay goal, which, by the way, I believe was in response to our very own DJ Tyrant, who used to do a show on our old station.
3539064	3542285	I remember, because I follow PopCap and DJ on Instagram.
3542785	3570225	Twitter, and he said something about like I was just playing Peggle, the game is fun or something like that, I wish I had it on the iPhone or whatever, and then PopCap I think made that response, I don't remember, I'm sorry if I'm misappropriating this information, but I remember it came up right after that conversation, is that PopCap made this tweet like, oh yeah, it's going to come out on the iPhone, and then the tweet disappeared and all the game blogs jumped on it but I was always kind of like, I thought they had already said that Peggle was going to come out on the iPhone, I mean, duh
3570945	3572185	Rob, do you watch much CNN?
3596118	3601459	I read CNN.com, but I don't watch, like I reload that a lot at work, but I don't watch the station.
3601639	3615323	I want to say, I think it's the Situation Room, but one of the programs on there actually reads comments off Twitter, the CNN Twitter, and responds to comments about stories that are going on.
3615563	3616123	Yeah, we used to do that.
3616143	3617123	Kind of like how we use our chat room.
3617583	3618523	Yeah, it's crazy.
3618723	3620984	We used to do the Twit thing, but we stopped.
3622151	3623152	Actually, you know what's funny?
3623212	3624932	I was going to bring back the Twitter thing tonight.
3625032	3625693	And I'm not just saying that.
3625733	3626893	Look, I already had it reloaded.
3627473	3628734	Already here on the screen, ready to go.
3628754	3629795	I was going to do it during the break.
3630175	3631635	Alright, alright.
3631775	3633096	I was just going to say, yeah.
3633116	3634877	We are bringing back the Twitter interactivity today.
3634897	3638438	There are things that I normally post on my Twitter that are news related.
3639939	3640960	Thank you for reminding me.
3641100	3642560	I completely forgot about it.
3643020	3644161	What did you post on your Twitter?
3644181	3645321	Can I go back and read them on air?
3645962	3646742	Go right ahead.
3646822	3647362	I don't care.
3648503	3648583	Um...
3650319	3650839	Let me see.
3651379	3652060	Because I don't remember.
3652100	3656321	Sometimes, a lot of the things you write on Twitter, you've already told me about in the past.
3657622	3658042	Sometimes.
3659142	3660162	You talked about Scratch.
3660503	3660603	Oh!
3661083	3662223	Oh, the Lego game!
3662563	3664124	Nobody caught that one, huh?
3664744	3666945	No.
3667005	3670586	You figured out Lego Rock Band is shit, and you know what the new Lego game is.
3670766	3670946	Yeah.
3671126	3671707	You want to find out?
3671747	3672627	Go find Loki's Twitter.
3673027	3673867	I'm not going to read it for you.
3675888	3676768	It's probably just one of them.
3678069	3678329	All right.
3679468	3680889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3706064	3713688	Nothing Else Matters, One, Seek and Destroy, Memory Remains, hopefully with Marianne Faithfull intact because that song is awesome because of her.
3714688	3717990	The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Whiplash.
3718830	3726974	Some other artists that are showing up in the game, Alice in Chains, No Excuses, Bob Seger, Foo Fighters, Judas Priest, Leonard Skitterd.
3727735	3728635	Is it Turn the Page?
3728875	3729596	Yeah, it's Turn the Page.
3730676	3732317	Why don't they just do Metallica's cover?
3733473	3746977	I don't know Leonard Skinner is in it Motorhead Ace of Spades Yes, Ace of Spades Queen with Stone Cold Crazy You know what?
3747137	3748317	I just figured it out What?
3748958	3753419	Those are all songs that Metallica has covered I think a lot of these are, yeah
3754809	3755770	The Garage Inc.
3755930	3756891	album, remember?
3757612	3758432	Oh, that's right.
3758673	3760695	I know they've done Stone Cold Crazy.
3761015	3762797	Because I've got it on my phone.
3762817	3763057	Shit.
3763357	3767621	They've done the other one.
3768762	3770364	Ace of Spades?
3771485	3775569	I don't remember if they did Ace of Spades, but I know that they did Turn the Page.
3775589	3778152	Because that's one of my favorite covers of that song ever.
3779608	3785810	Also Slayer, Social Distortion, System of a Down, Thin Lizzy, lots of stuff in here.
3786611	3789332	I do want to also mention, this is what I thought was kind of interesting also.
3790432	3798855	If you have the download content that was the Death Magnetic CD for download, it will actually work the 10 tracks into the game's campaign mode.
3799455	3807460	If you already own World Tour on Wii or PlayStation 2, you'll get Broken, Beaten, Scarred, Cyanide, and My Apocalypse.
3808321	3814305	They'll already be on the disc for you since download content is kind of different on Wii and PlayStation 2.
3814745	3816867	I thought that kind of interaction was interesting.
3816987	3827434	And they also announced that the game will be coming on PS3 and Xbox 360 at the end of March on the 29th and then the PS2 and Wii later.
3829330	3837515	You know, now the question, this isn't set up like World Tour with the other instrument setups or anything, is it?
3837535	3837835	No, it is.
3838095	3840436	It's basically with all, like Rock Band now.
3840896	3841757	Well, damn it.
3841777	3843077	I'm going to have to buy it.
3843378	3844238	Because it's Metallica.
3845859	3846239	Wow.
3846979	3848880	What role will Metallica play in your cult?
3850261	3851762	The official band of the universe.
3854770	3855110	All right.
3855930	3856651	Not interested.
3856971	3857271	Sorry.
3857311	3858371	Yeah, I quit your cult.
3858431	3858991	No, I'm just kidding.
3861292	3863413	I thought ABBA got to be the official band of the universe.
3863453	3864333	I'm very disappointed.
3865934	3868455	ABBA gets official pop band of the universe.
3868635	3868915	All right.
3868955	3869335	Fair enough.
3869475	3870715	See, that would be a game right there.
3870795	3873636	Tweak62 says 80s Metallica is great.
3873916	3875177	90s Metallica is pretty okay.
3875537	3879818	They should have a game where 80s Metallica battles 90s Metallica and see who wins.
3880098	3881659	How about ABBA versus Metallica?
3883717	3884417	That should be a game.
3884557	3886178	Alas, Abba, we knew you well.
3887039	3890561	As you get stomped in the face by Lars Ulrich.
3890761	3893282	No, all Abba would have to do is dress Metallica.
3895964	3896564	Alright, anyway.
3897845	3899245	Let's move on with more news.
3900186	3900906	Do we gotta?
3901046	3901467	Of course.
3901807	3902647	It's what we do on this show.
3902667	3903308	I don't know if you heard.
3903648	3904789	Virtual Console!
3905189	3905629	Hey, hey.
3906870	3907850	There's stuff out.
3909091	3910191	And this is UK stuff, right?
3910211	3910792	I like stuff.
3912374	3921277	Coming out to Virtual Console in the UK is Mario Golf for 1,000 Wii Points because it was a Nintendo 64 game.
3922097	3927319	And Wonder Boy and Monster Land from the Sega Master System, which will be 500 Wii Points.
3927959	3928639	You know what's funny?
3929460	3930440	We were just playing that like...
3931935	3933797	Dan brought out the Master System.
3933837	3934918	We were just playing this the other day.
3934958	3935278	Very cool.
3935298	3937600	I haven't been following Virtual Console in the U.S.
3937620	3938200	What did we get?
3938260	3939141	Do you remember?
3939161	3939341	Yeah.
3954129	3954470	I don't know.
3954490	3955731	I don't buy anything on Virtual Console.
3955951	3956492	I haven't either.
3956672	3957373	It's been a long time.
3957393	3963200	Actually, I haven't fired up the Wii in a while either, now that I've ruined Animal Crossing for my wife again.
3964041	3965623	Did your wife officially quit Animal Crossing?
3965763	3967645	Yeah, she's done with it because I ruined it for her.
3967685	3968306	I started cheating.
3968586	3969047	Sorry to hear it.
3969673	3972334	It's because, you know, I got bored with it.
3972914	3974374	There's nothing more I can really do.
3974414	3975755	What else was there to do but cheat?
3976395	3976895	Exactly.
3977015	3977815	It's fun to cheat.
3977835	3978576	It's fun to steal.
3979016	3984617	Especially when those animals piss you off because they're being just assholes, and you just go into their house and steal all their shit.
3984677	3985358	It's like, ha!
3985998	3987538	How do you steal their stuff?
3987738	3991860	There's a code where you can pick up their stuff, furniture, move it around.
3992140	3995981	The only thing is it doesn't save it, I don't think, so you can't just do that.
3996974	4004564	But it did, sort of, in the game that we played, because I stole all the stuff and they had, like, crap on the floor and I was just, like, random junk that...
4006241	4007642	You know what I would love to see?
4008303	4010304	It's been a while since we've had an OLR dream game.
4011324	4019469	I would love to see a game that kind of takes that art style of Animal Crossing or what have you and mixes it with Grand Theft Auto.
4019889	4021690	I'm on the same page with you.
4022010	4025332	When a villager pisses me off, I want to put a hit on him.
4025452	4029994	So what you're basically saying is you would like to see a game that's like Grand Theft Auto.
4030194	4032896	Don't even say Happy Tree Friends because that shit ain't going to cut it.
4033882	4035803	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4063737	4064557	or something like that.
4066518	4067519	Or animal taking.
4067919	4070740	I want to be able to kidnap animals.
4071940	4072481	Alright, anyway.
4075062	4075642	Let's move on.
4075862	4078503	Other virtual console news, I guess.
4078908	4079949	Yes.
4080269	4083731	Anyways, so... There's a brand new game coming out.
4083751	4086793	It's almost like I made it or something, but it's not.
4087114	4088555	It's called Super Meat Boy.
4089415	4093338	And it's co-created by Edmund McMillan.
4094078	4094719	And apparently...
4096580	4097522	Not really sure what it is.
4097702	4104732	I guess it's a Flash game, kind of similar to N Plus.
4105953	4111421	And it'll be coming out to the Virtual Console sometime soon, apparently.
4112202	4112582	SuperMeatBoy.com
4134332	4138374	What if instead of calling it Super Meat Boy, they called it Super Bacon Boy?
4138854	4140975	This game would be the top... It doesn't look like bacon.
4141115	4145116	It would be the top selling... Well, they need to go back and edit the sprites or something and make it Super Bacon Boy.
4145436	4148478	Because it would be the top selling WiiWare game ever.
4148978	4150898	Like, even more than Strong Bad and all that stuff.
4151159	4151899	Super Bacon Boy.
4154240	4157181	That was a big mistake, whoever made that decision to change bacon to meat.
4158701	4160362	But, uh, yeah.
4161442	4163063	Apparently it's extremely hard
4165714	4167175	Well, I guess it'll be a challenge then.
4167195	4168557	If you don't cut it, you don't cut it.
4170519	4171339	Rob, give me a pretzel.
4173421	4174783	Stop making bad jokes and I will.
4175890	4176991	Andrew's not here to do it for us.
4177131	4179992	No more free handouts, says GameTap.
4180112	4181713	And it happened on Thursday.
4181753	4185454	They removed 97 games from the free lineup of games.
4185894	4197259	But look, in this economy and with the whole changing of the hands that went on over at GameTap, right, because Metabully bought them out or whatever, or I think they went up for sale and Metabully bought them, you knew some changes were going to come.
4197519	4203222	That's two-thirds of the free games are gone, including some games like Art of Fighting.
4203982	4215872	Baseball Stars Professional, Bust a Move Again, Twinkle Star Strikes, Rainbow Islands, so on and so on.
4215952	4217413	No more free handouts for you.
4218354	4221957	However, it should be pointed out, you can still play these games on GameTap.
4222478	4223479	You just have to pay for it.
4224159	4224599	You know what?
4224900	4227102	This makes me even more not want to use our service.
4228900	4236108	I was actually considering signing up for GameTap, and now there's no point.
4236609	4237791	Well, the games are there.
4237811	4238752	You just have to pay for them now.
4238912	4241555	I was going to pay for other games, but I don't want to play for shit I already own.
4243137	4244899	Which is damn near everything on that list.
4245960	4246741	At least the good ones.
4249635	4250276	I'm going to be honest.
4250316	4254158	I used to talk a lot about GameTap on the show, but I did finally cancel my account a few months ago.
4254878	4255919	I just wasn't playing it enough.
4256339	4258720	But now that I'm not playing WoW, who knows?
4258780	4259541	I might have to go back.
4260061	4260421	We'll see.
4261442	4263903	And plus, I was a little sad I couldn't play Myst Online anymore.
4264863	4270086	Even though it was weird, the game was very weird, there was something about it that made me want to play it once in a while.
4270106	4271447	I have something that you should play.
4271807	4273508	I found my DVD copy of Pissed.
4274469	4274809	God.
4274849	4275849	It's the parody of Myst.
4276510	4278751	I've actually remembered that game, sadly.
4279271	4280192	Somewhere I've got Monty Python.
4280212	4281212	It's a complete waste of time.
4281932	4284613	Alright, I've got a few more stories for you guys and we're going to get to our break tonight.
4285934	4289256	Well, this next story is Lost Planet.
4292137	4293117	News on the sequel, finally?
4294018	4294938	News on the movie.
4295898	4299080	Oh, now this is what Capcom spent their whole E3 talking about, right?
4300360	4304922	They are saying that it's going to cost between $150 to $200 million dollars.
4310357	4315261	and that's just a crazy, crazy, crazy ass budget.
4316903	4320105	However, you know why it's going to be completely awesome?
4320946	4323508	It's written by David Hayter.
4323828	4325109	The voice of Solid Snake.
4326090	4328432	Wasn't Titanic made for like $180 million or something?
4330475	4333657	Like, in that Pearl Harbor movie, was that it?
4333777	4336738	That cost like a shit ton of money to make.
4336758	4338559	It cost like $200 million.
4338579	4339880	This one's written by David Hayter.
4340200	4345202	It's just, I understand that, but most moviegoers have no idea who the fuck he is.
4345843	4348324	He might be like a prince in your cult or whatever.
4348344	4349744	The first X-Men movie.
4350085	4350945	Oh, that's right, he did.
4351525	4352366	Fuck yeah, he did.
4352386	4353366	He was a good one.
4353586	4354347	I stand corrected.
4354667	4356308	But still, that's a big budget.
4357688	4358809	That's a big risk.
4360503	4361443	I hope it pays off for him.
4361844	4363804	I hope so, because it's David Hader.
4364965	4368226	And also it's directed by the guy who did Spider-Man.
4370047	4370507	Sam Raimi?
4372088	4376170	Avi, I read the... Sorry, produced, not directed.
4376190	4376810	I was going to say.
4378251	4379711	Now we're talking Army of Darkness here.
4379731	4382072	No, I meant produced.
4383093	4383793	Alright, we'll see.
4385779	4387143	Sorry, I was checking out Super Meat Boy.
4387965	4390171	It's exactly like N+.
4390271	4391313	You were playing with your meat, Loki?
4391614	4392918	Yes, I was playing with my meat.
4393018	4394000	It's exactly like...
4394963	4397705	During the show... Loki, I know.
4398085	4399346	So unexpected of me.
4400606	4403348	Anyways, so this is kind of interesting.
4403428	4406730	There was an announcement made this week.
4406810	4410492	Remember everyone was saying, hey, what happened to the Indiana Jones game?
4411753	4417997	Well, that Indiana Jones game that they were showing us before, not coming out, at least right now...
4418757	4419798	Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings
4435254	4453586	so that's pretty cool apparently though they said that it's also been rated for the PSP and possibly they're thinking PS2 because if it's coming to the PSP they pour a lot of games over to the PS2 anyways so very very cool
4455652	4456734	And it's translated to this.
4472626	4473186	Exactly.
4474046	4477387	Well, that's what it is, a golden raspberry award.
4477507	4484169	And I think they literally dip something in cheap gold plating or something and they valued the award at like $5 or something like that.
4484509	4488410	Well, they give away these Razzie awards to the worst of the worst movies of the year.
4488430	4493271	And I think I read somewhere this year The Love Guru got nominated for more Razzies than any other movie.
4493291	4495232	That was that Mike Myers movie that came out during the summer.
4495252	4495732	A lot of people...
4496232	4497133	Thank you for watching!
4516021	4520965	Now, he might win that, but it might, you know, Love Guru did get 10 nominations, so it might beat it.
4521285	4522806	But here's the other thing you should recognize.
4523246	4526028	Uwe Boll has been guaranteed an award at the ceremony.
4526469	4531713	He is going to earn the Lifetime Recognition Award of Worst Career Achievement.
4533993	4535714	This is all the clap he earns.
4536394	4538035	Linda Blair has earned this award.
4539056	4540957	Erwin R. Allen earned this award.
4541257	4543679	And Ronald Reagan once earned this award as well.
4543699	4545740	Because remember, he was an actor before he did all that other stuff.
4546240	4554785	So Uwe Boll is going to be getting a type of Lifetime Achievement Award from the Razzies for his shit-tacious films.
4556812	4557152	Awesome.
4557672	4561995	Congratulations to Uwe Boll for finally getting recognized with a Hollywood Movie Award.
4562995	4567637	Now he can say, but now, see, now he can say the award winning Uwe Boll in his movies.
4567697	4568738	Yeah, he won shit.
4568818	4569398	There he goes.
4570119	4572700	They should just poop and dip it in gold and give it to him.
4573905	4574405	They just might.
4574445	4577167	But now the question is, will he show up to collect it in person?
4577507	4579248	Because some people have a sense of humor about it.
4579348	4581810	Very few people go to collect their awards in person.
4582170	4587874	But Halle Berry actually showed up the year she won Worst Actress and Catwoman.
4588314	4593758	She actually showed up to collect the award in person and told off the people in the crowd, but in a joking way.
4594138	4599921	And that's cool that she could be self... She recognized that the movie was shit and could kind of make fun of herself.
4600022	4600522	Like, you know...
4600902	4602003	You always have to kind of laugh at that.
4602343	4606546	And if I recall correctly, didn't Uwe Boll show up at Penny Arcade Expo in 07?
4606826	4608527	Or something like that?
4608567	4611729	Like when they couldn't get Jack Thompson, they got Uwe Boll and he came out on stage?
4612149	4617432	I mean, with all the shit that guy gets, that takes guts.
4618092	4618893	He is a boxer.
4619834	4621675	YYR in our chatroom is convinced he will.
4621735	4622395	He will pick it up.
4622435	4623716	He loves to be in front of the camera.
4625319	4625639	Media whore!
4653625	4655528	This isn't a word for you being bad.
4655628	4657610	Although I hope that wasn't Pierce Brosnan and Mamma Mia.
4657650	4661654	How dare they give Mamma Mia a Razzie nomination.
4661694	4662335	How dare they.
4665098	4667281	I realize Pierce Brosnan was pretty shitty in that movie.
4667301	4669223	Why isn't that nominated for Best Picture, Rob?
4669263	4670104	That's what I'm wondering.
4670124	4670544	Alright, anyhow.
4675493	4676554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4703755	4704416	DarkSakura.
4704916	4706357	What should the kids be playing this week?
4707118	4710361	The game of the week is Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
4711903	4714245	Which is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, if kind of dumb.
4714265	4716707	Give it up a little bit, Rob.
4716747	4718909	That's just the intro music.
4727688	4735630	Okay, now the Alex Kidd games were their own little fun dinky platformers.
4736270	4743191	Alex Kidd in Shinobi World was an attempt that Sega wanted to do to actually parody their own titles.
4743251	4749513	You know how there was Parodius for Gradius and Kidd Dracula for the Castlevania series.
4750473	4754154	The game was originally going to be called, it was actually Shinobi Kidd.
4755455	4757898	and it was just going to be a parody.
4757918	4758659	You hear the music.
4760401	4762363	It's the music from...
4765143	4766684	Uh-huh, Shinobi.
4768066	4768406	You here?
4769407	4769647	Anyway.
4771749	4776152	So, um, it was gonna be, yeah, like, just a cute little parody of, um, Shinobi.
4776913	4784079	And, um, it ended up, uh, becoming an Alex Kidd game so that they could perpetuate series.
4784099	4785600	Keep in mind, this was before we had Sonic.
4785620	4788282	This is Sega Master System era, y'all.
4789163	4793426	And, um, but it was, uh, a little funny thing about it is that the first boss...
4794487	4796129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4817924	4819505	But yeah, it's just a cute little platformer.
4819525	4821106	You've got four stages in it.
4822387	4828932	Where you have the Kabuto stage, Raid of the Helicopters, the Jungle, and Battle with the Dark Ninja.
4829452	4832174	So it's a pretty fun little game.
4832514	4834376	I really always like playing this game.
4834776	4838479	You have to do, since this is an Alex Kidd game, you have to do those damn Janken fights.
4840189	4841971	I actually, Rob, I don't remember.
4841991	4846977	You want to know exactly how long it's been since I've played this game?
4847818	4848158	A while.
4849800	4852744	I have to think about it.
4852764	4853364	We'll say a while.
4854185	4856168	My freshman year of college...
4857856	4864478	I traded all of my Nintendo systems for all of my friend's Sega systems for a week.
4865759	4867400	Just so I could see what the big deal was.
4867460	4869500	That's when I developed my Sega love.
4870781	4876143	I had his power base converter and played the shit out of this game and Castle of Illusion.
4878015	4881237	Oh, the boss of this level looks kind of like the Opa-Opa, I get what you're saying.
4881518	4881978	Yeah.
4882178	4882598	Oh, funny.
4882718	4882979	Okay.
4884019	4887482	This is a big, fun, parody game.
4888402	4889243	And I love the music.
4889603	4891284	I just think it's great.
4891584	4894326	I really like- I really love a lot of the Sega Master System games.
4894927	4899710	I also love the American boxes for them, just because they're so shitty and generic.
4900250	4902272	They have, like, cute artwork, blah blah!
4902592	4903513	Grid background!
4905461	4908703	But yeah, this was an Alex Kidd game.
4909424	4921352	You know, I actually liked a lot of the other Alex Kidd games because there was the Alex Kidd Miracle World and High Tech World.
4921832	4922572	That was another one.
4922592	4924994	But this one is actually my favorite of the Alex Kidd games.
4926175	4927195	Alright, there you have it.
4927235	4930758	Your classic game of the week, Alex Kidd in Shinobi World.
4932765	4937326	A parody-rific game of some of Sega's great franchises.
4938166	4941927	That is going to do it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio, but we're not done yet.
4941967	4945768	We've got plenty more news to report on in Part B, so stick around, guys.
4946148	4948369	We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4948389	4951709	And hey, those of you that use Twitter, keep an eye out during this break.
4951789	4952630	Show us your tweets.
4953050	4957911	We'll read some of your responses when we come back after this little break here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4964963	4974855	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 25th of 2009 with our 310th episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4975275	4976997	These numbers are getting so high, it's just obscene.
4977017	4978339	And yes, that's starting with one.
4979460	4980482	We've been doing this a little while.
4981262	4983505	Anyhow, show us your tweets.
4984386	4989008	We asked on Twitter during the break, what should Rob do now that he left World of Warcraft?
4989048	4990789	And during the break, you guys responded.
4991409	4993430	GS68 says, get Castle Crashers.
4993950	4996131	Actdeft says, update the podcast in time.
4996451	4998212	That or play more games on Xbox Live Arcade.
4998952	5003875	Janai702 says, Rob should spend his leftover WoW subscription money on a super huge sandwich with bacon.
5004435	5005255	Om nom nom nom.
5005555	5006636	That's actually a very good idea.
5007639	5010660	Harry AKA says he should check himself into rehab before he relapses.
5011341	5015643	MistyOLR says, I don't know, work on the OLR shirts so I can do some pimping during Heisen.
5015983	5016523	That's a good idea.
5017763	5021825	Zakupilot256 says Rob should seek addiction counseling to prevent a relapse.
5022585	5026107	BlueSwim says Rob should play Kick the Ferret with, of course, the ferret.
5026827	5028208	Just joking, DarkSakura.
5028288	5028848	I heart the ferret.
5030750	5036671	X-Link 777 says, start a new drug habit or tossing a few tacos at people that don't like ABBA.
5038092	5042013	I love it when we get last week's jokes incorporated into the show.
5043033	5044953	Oh, DarkSakura, I wish you were here for that story.
5045373	5050114	Some kid threw a taco at his mom over a video game.
5051055	5052155	And he got sent to jail.
5053135	5054335	The mom called the police.
5054755	5055696	The kid went to jail.
5055716	5056876	That's fucking stupid.
5058755	5060216	What a way to teach him a lesson, though.
5061056	5063897	Giovedea says, Doing anything is better than playing WoW.
5064417	5066678	DarkTetsuya says, Start the cult with DarkSakura.
5067438	5069359	DJ Tyrant says, Play Persona 3 and 4.
5070559	5073980	Had no idea Rob left because I'm playing WoW right now.
5075361	5080163	SchmittyDog says, Rob should either create an ABBA tribute band or work on his musical career.
5080943	5081923	Have you heard me sing?
5082784	5086885	Crozy says, He should make a WoW-themed level on LittleBigPlanet
5087185	5101375	and hope it doesn't get taken down by moderation there actually was a wow theme level on LittleBigPlanet and it was actually kind of funny Biohaze20, last one I'm going to read here says wait until something better is out who knows when who knows when
5102130	5103492	I can't believe they're titling it this, but...
5124184	5124886	TMNT Smash Up
5133925	5135846	Yes, that is clever.
5136846	5138546	Ubisoft, way to go.
5139687	5145928	Apparently, it's going to feature arenas that will change throughout the battles.
5147889	5150570	You might remember something similar to Power Stone 2.
5152250	5153871	Or even Smash Bros., I guess.
5154371	5158572	You'll see players defeating their opponents either by knocking them off the stage...
5159392	5163742	or by emptying their health meter entirely, which can be filled with pizza.
5164904	5167951	Wow, if this does not sound like a ripoff of Smash Bros.,
5169608	5170428	I'll still play it.
5170508	5171068	It's Turtles.
5171128	5174529	But it says apparently this is now targeted for the Wii.
5174669	5176890	It says there will be no motion controlled attacks.
5177030	5182331	The waggle isn't ruled out for other aspects or context sensitive moves and stuff.
5182451	5188013	It's described as dark and gritty as far as like the graphic style.
5188693	5195234	And I guess Turtles co-creator Peter Laird is penning the single story or single player story.
5196895	5197035	And
5198274	5202638	You know, currently, as far as the roster goes, Ninja Turtles and Splinter are confirmed.
5205220	5205480	Hmm.
5206401	5206782	Alright.
5207522	5207862	Whatever.
5207882	5210345	I don't know, it's neat.
5212031	5214193	I don't know, I'm a little apprehensive about these type of games.
5214253	5220077	It'll never be as good as it was right when the arcade game and the original NES game were out.
5220757	5221318	It's just not.
5221458	5224080	The NES game blew.
5224280	5226601	Yeah, okay, but at least it had a good soundtrack.
5227222	5228523	But the arcade game was the best.
5228703	5234547	The best home version of any Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game is Turtles in Time.
5234907	5235488	End of story.
5238045	5238546	I'll give it to you.
5238626	5239386	It was perfect.
5255993	5257115	A new video game title.
5257215	5258497	It's called Metal God.
5259098	5261943	And this was discovered, a trademark that was filed on January 11th.
5262304	5266050	It covers computer games, video games, and game controllers for computer games.
5266551	5266931	Huh.
5267813	5268814	Guitar Hero ripoff?
5269980	5270360	Death Metal Hero
5292571	5295573	That is kind of cool, but it's not the same thing as actually playing GWAR.
5296013	5296313	True.
5296693	5299055	So GWAR or GTFO?
5299395	5300055	I hope you're listening.
5300176	5300676	Rob Halford.
5304967	5305107	Halo!
5305147	5305327	Halo!
5334966	5336967	Halo Wars Halo Wars Halo Wars Halo Wars
5365256	5366077	Is that Loki mode?
5366898	5368421	I have to tutorial sometimes.
5369562	5373008	Like Mirror's Edge because I can't remember what I'm supposed to be doing in that.
5374693	5375193	Mirror's Edge is hard.
5399912	5401433	We'll have the Mythic Map Pack.
5402433	5405434	And I don't know when the US version is to be out.
5406174	5406715	March 3rd.
5406975	5407375	March 3rd.
5407675	5407895	Okay.
5408315	5410876	I'm like a freaking encyclopedia of games.
5410936	5414677	I swear to God, I don't like... Hey, it makes you great on the show.
5414737	5415538	Yeah, it makes you good.
5415598	5419919	I also don't know if that beta date is for us or for the UK.
5420660	5422000	But it's definitely for the UK.
5422840	5424141	I just don't know if it applies to us as well.
5424181	5425581	I'm pretty sure it's a worldwide thing.
5425601	5426422	It's the 5th for us, yeah.
5426442	5426582	Yeah.
5427694	5430957	I'll check it out.
5431077	5432539	I own all the Halo games.
5433660	5442287	There better, better, better, better, better be a Red vs. Blue introduction or something in it with Sarge.
5442347	5444209	You want a reference somewhere in the game?
5444730	5444930	Yes.
5445030	5445390	We'll see.
5445510	5445831	We'll see.
5445851	5446511	Maybe a unit.
5446731	5447052	We'll see.
5448103	5449164	Thank you for watching!
5460427	5464510	Talking about video game inspired fan tributes, I don't remember if I mentioned this on the show.
5464530	5471935	I think I mentioned this before we went live, but something, believe it or not, I finally saw for the first time, ironically, the day I quit WoW, was The Guild.
5472735	5473976	I don't know if you've ever seen this.
5474056	5477659	It's this YouTube thing that kind of parodies the whole World of Warcraft.
5477679	5481081	I only saw the first little four-minute episode, but it's hilarious.
5481661	5483382	And I just want to tell you, people aren't that bad.
5483483	5486585	Actually, some people are that bad, but I was never that bad.
5487205	5488287	Didn't you see Dr. Horrible's
5501488	5502829	No, I did not see Doctor Horrible yet.
5503549	5504490	I was too busy playing WoW.
5504790	5506351	You need to watch it.
5506531	5507432	I'll check it out.
5507632	5513336	To go back to what I was talking about, about the TMNT fighter thing, I forgot when we mentioned this the first time.
5513736	5522422	It's actually being put together by some of the ex-Brawl team, which is probably why it's a little bit like Brawl, and Team Ninja.
5523622	5524303	Oh, interesting.
5524623	5528986	So if it's by Team Ninja, does that mean we're going to get April O'Neil with ginormous tits?
5530660	5530940	3 parts, Rob!
5548496	5550858	3!
5548997	5550858	I'll watch it eventually.
5552399	5553259	Mini Ninjas.
5553659	5557781	This is a game that's being put out by IO Interactive.
5557841	5567247	You may remember them of putting out such games as the Hitman franchise or I think they did maybe Kane and Lynch as well.
5568767	5570989	This has actually been rated by the ESRB.
5571069	5571909	It's E10+.
5571969	5573850	It's kind of a cute action game.
5574490	5576712	I also talked about it about a year ago from
5577592	5578733	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5605103	5631430	well it's also better than um oh god what the hell is that crappy movie franchise not um three ninjas yeah it's better than three ninjas or pocket ninjas because that movie also sucked or little ninjas isn't that also a like a three ninjas type movie yes oh god i remember watching that it was so horrible like what was the like called like the guy like a
5633314	5635475	Don't make me go back to that place, Loki.
5636816	5640117	What was that, the Dollar Tree video thing?
5642298	5645319	Never buy a video for a dollar because you get what you pay for.
5645779	5647640	Well, here's something you can buy relatively cheap.
5648200	5649400	Crystal Defenders.
5649620	5651001	This is a game put out by Squeenix.
5651061	5652541	It's a mobile and iPod game.
5652842	5654742	It's about defending towers, basically.
5655323	5658204	It's actually going to be coming out for consoles, according to Fumitsu Magazine.
5658224	5659724	They're going to put it out on WiiWare.
5660084	5661185	It's called Crystal Defenders R1.
5662325	5662966	Wifi Connection Support
5677122	5677623	DarkSakura.com
5702011	5703092	DarkSakura, Open Up The Mailbag
5724540	5725140	Just three.
5725641	5725961	Alrighty.
5726481	5728143	Hi, Orange Lounge Radio!
5728203	5728703	Hi!
5729624	5734748	I'm a latecomer to this podcast and I found out while browsing various podcasts on the Zune Marketplace.
5735428	5735748	Hey!
5736749	5739131	Well, thank you, Zune Marketplace, for the plug.
5739713	5742976	I'm glad I've stumbled onto it as it's a very entertaining podcast.
5756269	5762633	You shouldn't worry too much about it being horror, even though my most cowardly horror movie-loathing friends enjoy Left 4 Dead.
5763394	5769878	This is mainly because Left 4 Dead is less a survival horror game and first-person shooter as it is a party game.
5769978	5774541	I explained it to one of my friends best when I said Left 4 Dead is pretty much Rock Band with the Undead.
5775142	5776022	Listener, Ross.
5776623	5776983	P.S.
5777383	5783407	I decided to join your Steam community group, but are there only 19 people in it?
5783547	5785729	I know there's got to be more listeners than that.
5786449	5788131	Maybe a little encouragement from the show?
5788832	5789312	Join it!
5790694	5792636	I don't even remember where the Steam community is at.
5792696	5793637	I know it's going to sound horrible.
5793657	5794678	I don't even know if I'm in it.
5795479	5796921	I don't think I am.
5796941	5798302	So I'm going to have to look it up.
5798843	5800425	I didn't even know we had a Steam community.
5802000	5809524	I must admit, it must have come up like once in a show a long time ago, like when I first got Steam, and probably because I never used it, it lost Steam.
5811225	5818789	But I will check it out, and I want to get Left 4 Dead, and another game I've been eyeing getting on Steam is Mirror's Edge, because I kind of want to check that out.
5819950	5822831	And for some reason I'm feeling like playing it on the PC as opposed to a console.
5823131	5823472	So we'll see.
5825137	5848011	I will check out Left 4 Dead though and yeah go find the Orange Lounge Radio Steam community and I'll plug it next week on the show and then I'll play it and then I can play with listeners because I don't know a lot of people that play PC games so I'm sure there's there you go we'll see next email dun dun dun which actually I got two emails from the same person and one is a continuation so let's just go for it okay
5848905	5852226	To start with, my brother just won a PlayStation 3 at work.
5852426	5856708	Let me reiterate, my brother won a frequent PlayStation 3 at work.
5857148	5858749	An 80 gig model specifically.
5859289	5866332	He's gotten GT5 Prologue, is getting GTA 4, and my getting LittleBigPlanet are givens.
5867392	5867572	True dat.
5867592	5868212	True dat.
5894918	5900161	My Guitar Hero World Tour somehow got the cymbal wires cut slash torn.
5900661	5908146	Probably it's having a sensitivity issue, so I've gone ahead and replaced it with the Wii RB1 drum kit.
5908386	5918992	Soon we'll see third-party drum kits for all the systems as common as third-party guitar controllers.
5919913	5923495	Also, dude, you could actually solder the wires too and fix it.
5925416	5930798	Anyway, I have Saints Row 2 and the ported form of Orange Box on my Gamefly list.
5931178	5933079	I have to see what else to look into.
5933239	5939262	My brother is a subscriber of Netflix and will be changing most of his rental list to Blu-ray versions of the movies.
5939662	5942063	Is the PS3 Netflix streaming currently available?
5943384	5944244	Xbox 360.
5945025	5946525	Yeah, it's only on Xbox 360.
5950407	5951328	I don't think you can...
5952885	5954446	using your PC.
5954947	5956088	No, you can watch movies on your PC.
5956988	5967416	Well, I know that, but I'm not sure if you can use the Netflix on PC as a media server and then stream it to your... No, I think it uses its own application, so I don't think you can do that.
5967916	5980346	They do have an application out there that will actually stream whatever is on your PC monitor, so using that, then yes, you could probably stream Netflix, but you'd have to find that first.
5982378	5983739	So, there you go.
5985439	5986220	Any more emails?
5986640	5988340	I haven't even done, Rob.
5988400	5988801	Oh, sorry!
5989361	5992282	I didn't conclude this one, Rob.
5993522	6002166	And just for the heck of asking, will the TV tuner units for the PSP and DS, although generally not readily available in the United States, become obsolete with the digital transition?
6003659	6005462	What a good question.
6005582	6009950	Well, obviously not in Japan, because they're not switching over there.
6009970	6011152	I mean, that's only in the US.
6011833	6012093	So...
6014958	6016478	I would think yes, they're going to be obsolete.
6016659	6022900	If they're using the same type of technology, if they're not receiving digital TV signals, which I doubt they are, then it's not going to work.
6023040	6028282	The TV tuners for the DS and stuff over there work with their network.
6028342	6030722	It's not the same as ours over here.
6031163	6034924	You can't tune in our stations with that TV tuner, basically.
6035924	6036124	Hmm.
6036684	6038965	So, you wouldn't be able to use them anyways.
6039045	6040205	I guess it depends how it works.
6040725	6043966	If it's basically hooking up rabbit ears to your DS, then it's not going to work.
6044366	6049227	But if it's somehow feeding... Because I thought it was a digital streaming service over there.
6049747	6051048	Was it OneSeg or something like that?
6052048	6052388	I don't know.
6052528	6054568	But I know it's not compatible over here.
6054749	6056569	That's why they haven't brought it out over here because...
6057912	6060514	You can't use it on our network.
6060714	6066058	Not that I don't think that many people would be interested in streaming or watching live TV.
6066098	6067359	I guess it could be useful.
6067776	6072757	Well, to conclude the email, by the way, it was from Robert M., by the way, just saying.
6074017	6085779	The second portion that was sent says, As if my last email wasn't long enough, since I found them for $20, I went ahead and purchased the Orange Box, good choice, Burnout Paradise, as well as LittleBigPlanet.
6086059	6088140	Hopefully my brother can invest in a second controller.
6088640	6090700	I'm replacing Orange Box with Fallout 3.
6091380	6092401	He found LittleBigPlanet for $20?
6092441	6093881	That's a hell of a find.
6094890	6095511	I'd say so.
6095531	6095971	Good for you.
6096231	6098593	Unless he just means that he just purchased it.
6098893	6104357	Orange Box and Burnout Paradise would most likely be in the less expensive range.
6106098	6106458	That's it.
6107039	6107999	Those are some good choices, though.
6108019	6108540	It's over!
6109080	6109420	That's it?
6109580	6110021	For emails?
6110361	6110561	Yes.
6110761	6111802	What a weak selection.
6112362	6114884	No offense to the people that did email us, but we didn't get a lot of emails.
6115284	6118086	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.
6118647	6118907	Mm-hmm.
6119895	6120996	Burnout Paradise
6138991	6139931	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6161021	6161762	Thanks for watching!
6178064	6182867	Browse while connected to the Criterion Games Network.
6183207	6186388	And you'll be able to see all the game updates and purchases and stuff like that.
6187189	6188830	Tweaked vehicle handling.
6189570	6193152	Earlier cars are now tweaked to be easier for newcomers to use.
6193732	6197514	And these cars are now slower, harder to crash, and less likely to spin out at low speeds.
6198395	6199495	Junkyard sorting.
6199515	6204418	You'll be able to compare the stats of the cars and you'll be able to filter out cars and bikes.
6205158	6207299	and upcoming download content vehicles.
6208059	6209679	Stunt run timer change.
6210279	6214240	They have a different timer now that starts much slower than before.
6214260	6217581	Allows beginners more wiggle room to start a combo.
6218821	6220382	And let's see here.
6220582	6222842	They've rebalanced the events.
6223222	6225963	All events have been modified to accommodate the new car speeds.
6226643	6229344	They have road rage tweaked a bit.
6229484	6233685	Players are no longer able to get additional time once they've reached the target score.
6236791	6237772	Let's see here.
6237972	6239113	Enhanced visuals.
6239774	6245177	They're going to be fixing some of the in-game billboards and smashes.
6245898	6246859	Stuff's easier to spot.
6246879	6251082	The lighting's been tweaked to make it more vibrant and easier to drive at night.
6251442	6259327	They have a new restart function, so if you fuck up during a race, you can restart it, which is nice, instead of having to just drive all the way back to the starting point.
6259648	6261249	And then, easier barrel rolls.
6263450	6264371	Barrel rolls are now
6265109	6265589	Automatic.
6267851	6268612	That's a lot of stuff.
6269453	6269633	Yeah.
6270313	6279661	And then, of course, the upcoming premium download content, the party toy cars and legendary cars, I think, are all coming out on the 6th.
6281262	6281963	That would be cool.
6282003	6286226	And new trophies, of course, tying in with that download content.
6286246	6286486	Awesome.
6288127	6288688	Awesome.
6289244	6310232	Alright, I love it, they have one that's Sound the Horn on the Silver Lake Super Jump in the Calvary Bootlegger Because that was the, you know, generally I know, I love how they have all their cute little new names for the vehicles I thought that was especially cute, how they get around the copyright there, or what have you
6312197	6320100	Well, speaking of download content, some very, very highly anticipated download content, probably by our very own Loki, is The Lost and the Damned.
6320240	6328483	That is the official name for the new downloadable expansion for Grand Theft Auto IV that is coming out on the Xbox 360 and only the Xbox 360.
6328883	6332104	The Lost and the Damned is coming out February 17th.
6332224	6334925	That's right, we finally have a release date, February 17th.
6335385	6336906	As far as how much it's going to set you back...
6338567	6339508	1,600 Microsoft Points.
6339568	6340629	That's 20 bucks.
6341149	6349777	Apparently, though, it will be about 10 to 20 hours of new gameplay, new missions, new music, new weapons, and apparently membership to a biker gang.
6350497	6354200	One thing apparently that's not in it, though, is the voice actor who originally did...
6355121	6356682	Nico's voice in Grand Theft Auto 4.
6356722	6358563	I remember reading a story about that as well this week.
6358924	6362346	Apparently, it just costs too damn much money for him to come back.
6362406	6368750	Well, he was saying that he wanted more money, or should have asked for more money, and he's not coming back because of that.
6369251	6375054	The other thing that kind of sucks, too, is that Lost and Damned download content is basically its own game.
6375535	6383080	So when you download that, you don't get new weapons in, say, the normal Grand Theft Auto game and stuff, because they say it just doesn't make sense that Nico would have access to...
6383700	6385081	you know, grenade launcher or something like that.
6385141	6385841	I say, fuck that.
6385881	6387482	Who gives a shit about continuity?
6387862	6389703	I mean, I want my damn tanks and stuff.
6390284	6393946	So, but, yeah, I will have to download this because it looks pretty awesome.
6395347	6397829	But it's not something that's going to be fluid with the original game.
6397869	6399511	It's like really a separate game.
6400251	6406777	Well, they're going to have a portion that kind of crosses over with Nico, but it's very brief.
6406897	6409859	I mean, he's in it for just a second during a cutscene.
6409879	6414984	Because you're going to have to copy-paste his voice acting from before if the guy's not coming back or get a guy to impersonate him.
6416185	6417946	Yeah, which is kind of lame.
6418126	6420468	I think they should just put out a pack later that's just...
6421579	6424160	over the top stuff like bring back the flamethrower.
6424441	6426642	They were going to have the flamethrower in this game and they cut it out.
6426682	6427382	It's lame.
6428082	6431364	Bring back the flamethrower, the minigun, the tanks.
6431684	6433225	Just go crazy with it.
6433305	6434365	And the Animal Crossing Village.
6435126	6436787	And they should bring zombies in there.
6436807	6441649	Have it where you defend Liberty City against a zombie attack or something.
6441709	6446872	Totally rip off 28 Days Later or something like that.
6449413	6449733	Alright.
6450053	6450714	We will see.
6452076	6452176	Porn!
6452236	6452576	No, Mega Man!
6471647	6473948	StarForce3, Red Joker, Black Ace
6491256	6492297	Which actually looks pretty cool.
6493378	6496140	I actually haven't played any of the Star Force games before.
6496841	6501665	But it's sort of an action RPG with what they call noise changes.
6502205	6511833	So you can actually use a hundred different noises to combine that changes Mega Man's look in the game and also changes his abilities.
6511973	6514775	It's based off of Earth, Wind, Air, and Fire.
6515596	6517658	Fire being the greatest of all time, of course.
6518178	6521939	and you can trade noises with other Nintendo Wi-Fi players.
6521959	6523700	So it's supposed to be out in the summer.
6524220	6524880	It looks sweet!
6525900	6526201	Yeah.
6526921	6527321	I don't know.
6528221	6529602	I want more side-scrolling Mega Man.
6529622	6530322	At least we got Mega Man 9.
6531682	6532403	That's hard to complain.
6532783	6535103	Why can't that be ported to DS is what I want to know.
6535123	6536324	There you go.
6536344	6537164	Just make Mega Man 10.
6538424	6540425	But make it easier for dum-dums like me.
6540565	6541345	No, keep it hard.
6542066	6543346	It gives you a sense of accomplishment.
6544466	6545607	Yeah.
6546167	6546387	Well...
6547789	6550991	There's a game that's coming out, or I should say it's not coming out.
6551211	6554253	It's a mature game by the name of Winter.
6554794	6560337	It was being put out by the team, Endspace.
6560858	6565561	Basically, they were behind the GameCube game Geist, which was kind of...
6566730	6567791	Not that successful.
6568151	6573215	Apparently they ran into a problem though with their sales and marketing groups.
6573355	6579479	Apparently the game, they could not get behind a Survivor horror title on the Wii.
6580200	6591968	And in spite of great sales like on the Resident Evil 4 and Umbrella Chronicles and stuff that's similar to this, they didn't get the green light to basically make this game.
6592389	6592989	Which is lame.
6593569	6594610	But the game itself...
6595871	6596492	Thanks for watching!
6613587	6615849	Now, you know, on the Wii.
6615869	6616649	That sucks.
6616909	6620672	You know, a somewhat serious looking survival horror game and they don't want to do it.
6621252	6622693	But yet they'll remake Resident Evil 4.
6622994	6623334	It's silly.
6623394	6627417	Seriously, with so much of a ripoff of Silent Hill, it's not even funny.
6627537	6632140	It was... You could have called it Silent Hill and people would have been like, Oh my god, Silent Hill!
6632340	6634201	You know, that close.
6636648	6637849	What about Silent Snow?
6638769	6641710	Is this game just going to slip into obscurity forever?
6641770	6643311	Do you think it's possible this game could show up?
6643751	6644631	It could come back.
6644711	6645232	You never know.
6645252	6648753	I mean, they're going to have, was it the Lost Mountain or something like that?
6648773	6653695	I think is one of the survival horror games coming out in the Wii.
6653755	6654995	And there's some other ones.
6655136	6657697	I mean, Sadness, whenever the hell that actually comes out.
6657717	6659297	Did Sadness end up getting canceled or something?
6659357	6663219	No, I don't think it's still being worked on.
6663239	6666060	That game looked pretty amazing and then just kind of disappeared.
6666912	6668912	Yeah.
6670193	6675774	It may come back later if they start doing more games that are like adult on the Wii and they end up being successful.
6675934	6679755	Because they can say, hey, you know, maybe we should put out this game.
6679815	6684516	Because if you look at some of the games like, for example, Two Human.
6684556	6687497	I mean, that thing was in development since like the Nintendo 64.
6687597	6689337	I mean, Cameo.
6689917	6691657	I mean, those weren't exactly great games.
6691777	6693418	But still, I mean, it could...
6694298	6694478	All right.
6705555	6706515	Dawn of War 2 Warhammer 40,000 Steam
6729225	6731127	And then suddenly it just disappeared.
6740700	6743922	GameStop.com is no longer offering the game.
6744462	6750306	If you call a GameStop store, they will tell you that Dawn of War 2, you can't pre-order this game.
6750746	6757210	But apparently, previously, you were able to get a Chapter Command War Gear set if you pre-ordered the game through GameStop.
6757710	6758931	So what the hell's going on?
6759811	6760972	The game didn't get cancelled.
6761032	6763153	In fact, they just mentioned that the game went gold.
6763893	6767976	THQ is behind the game, and they actually bumped up the release date.
6769255	6772356	So apparently though, something's going on with Steam.
6773056	6778718	The game is requiring you to install Steam, and of course Steam being the way that you can get games online.
6779078	6781939	Apparently GameStop Corporate not happy with this.
6782459	6785700	But the weird thing is, don't Valve games make you install Steam too?
6785840	6788021	Yeah, because it's Valve's program.
6788041	6789862	But yet they carry those games.
6789942	6792383	GameStop will carry Orange Box and those type of games.
6793363	6793583	Hmm.
6793603	6793663	Hmm.
6796028	6799410	GameStop is kind of pissed.
6800251	6810660	A lot of this is kind of rumor, but it would make sense because GameStop does not like it when digital distribution occurs before the game is released to retail.
6810740	6813983	This kind of goes back to when Penny Arcade Adventures came out.
6814143	6816485	I have to ask, why do they even care?
6816785	6819187	They don't really give a shit about PC titles.
6819547	6821749	If you've seen their PC selection, it's like a shelf.
6822290	6823791	Seriously, who gives a crap?
6825151	6826512	I don't know, maybe it's the principle of the thing.
6826532	6832755	It's like, oh, you're really cutting into our PC sales, which are very small anyways.
6833115	6833816	Who cares?
6834576	6848344	Anyway, take this news with a little bit of caution, because it's not necessarily... It could be some very strange misunderstanding, but a lot of people are reading into that the game is just not available.
6851381	6878449	I don't understand why they wouldn't carry game because I mean that's potential for people to trade in other things that they make a high margin off of you know to buy said game I mean hell they're doing it now I mean it's so ridiculous they're doing it now with download content cards oh I'm going to trade in some games to get a card to go download something off of Xbox Live Arcade I mean like or you know the Lost and Damned or the new Tomb Raider levels and stuff like that it's like
6879693	6879973	Really?
6880454	6882357	Why don't you just buy a card?
6882477	6883178	You know, a points card.
6883258	6884199	It's the same thing.
6886202	6886502	I don't know.
6887363	6888084	It's retarded.
6889892	6892113	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6912520	6913161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6933039	6938161	I'm sure we will see an official corporate response from one of the two in the next week, so you can probably bet we'll hear something about this next week.
6938181	6939382	Well, how about some different type of news?
6962298	6963378	Thanks for watching!
6981380	6982241	You're so mature.
6982401	6982861	I know.
6984062	6984343	Anyway.
6985163	6987225	He's working on a 2D RPG.
6987906	6988146	What?
6988726	6999175	Yeah, he's working on a 2D RPG, but it's... I really don't know what else to say about it.
6999235	7005520	It's just, it looks like a 2D platformer type of RPG-ish sort of thing.
7007182	7008323	But he said that he...
7010342	7017425	wants to say that they're trying to do something specific with the actual way the game plays.
7017986	7022268	There's really not too many details on it, and I squeezed the fear out by accident.
7024929	7029011	And he actually doesn't really have that much attention that he's paying to it.
7029031	7031972	It's more like going, okay, I'm going to work on the RPG.
7032012	7032673	Ooh, shiny!
7034774	7038916	So in other words, he'll do whatever he damn well pleases, but this is what's capturing his attention right now.
7039256	7039456	Yeah.
7040060	7040540	RPG.
7042841	7044122	Well, okay.
7044142	7051786	At least he's not developing it for the DS and he's not going to lock himself into a room because he can't get a dev tip.
7051826	7054567	Hey, that guy apparently finally let himself out of the room.
7054607	7055348	Trashed his room.
7056408	7057108	That guy had issues.
7057488	7058369	Let's throw a fit now.
7058569	7061350	I don't even remember that guy's name, and even if I did, I wouldn't want to say it.
7061570	7064791	I totally forgot about the guy, except I sort of remember us talking about it.
7064991	7068933	Yeah, remember the guy, he locked himself in a room and was throwing a fit because Nintendo wouldn't send him a dev kit or whatever?
7069213	7070133	Oh, the retard.
7070253	7074775	Yes, he finally quit his little tantrum and trashed his entire room on his way out.
7075795	7076575	I know, I know.
7076655	7078256	But yet, here we are talking about him.
7079600	7080461	and lots of people did.
7081021	7084524	This game looked lame anyways.
7084765	7085946	He's like, I need a dev cam.
7085966	7087227	I'm like, no, I don't want to play that game.
7087327	7088388	That game looks stupid.
7088668	7090349	I don't care if you waste it.
7090610	7093372	Seriously, it looked like something you'd make with RPG Maker.
7094994	7096515	Like the old RPG Maker.
7097656	7098517	Not anything good.
7099678	7100018	Sorry.
7101299	7101639	I don't know.
7102180	7102740	Maybe put ZZT.
7104815	7105316	on the DS.
7105476	7105896	Yes, they do.
7106577	7107558	ZZT on the DS.
7107678	7108039	Yes, they do.
7108339	7108820	I say yes.
7108840	7109401	Alright, more news.
7110475	7118856	Alright, well, in the tradition of download content for EA games, Skate 2 has now put out some download... Well, I wouldn't even call it download content.
7118896	7120757	You download a key to unlock crap.
7121317	7125358	Basically, it's a... Time is money pack.
7125938	7135819	It costs you 400 Microsoft points, and it will unlock all locations, skaters, and gear that can be earned by playing through Skate 2's career and online modes.
7137640	7138320	So basically...
7139349	7143072	For people that don't want to play the game, they'll just unlock everything right there for you.
7144753	7147875	Which begs the question, why even buy the game if you don't want to play through it?
7148176	7149777	So it's pay-to-unlock content.
7150057	7150257	Yes.
7150357	7151858	Which I always hate in video games.
7152799	7153099	It's stupid.
7153119	7155001	Pay-to-unlock cheat codes, that's basically it.
7155701	7156642	They've done this before.
7157363	7158323	With other games, right?
7158423	7163267	Yep, Tiger Woods, other EA games.
7164736	7167999	News about pay-to-unlock content makes me angry.
7168079	7170641	And here, yeah, Aesthetic Vampire says it perfect in chat.
7170921	7173463	Chat.orange.com, he says it's for lazy asses.
7174283	7176245	Absolutely, it is for lazy asses.
7176645	7184291	So to anyone that's actually going to support this kind of content and encourage them to put out this content in the future, I'd like to dedicate a little piece of angst to you.
7199264	7201050	FUs of the week time, DarkSakura
7201943	7211069	My biggest FUs go to incessant bitching without the will to do anything about it.
7211229	7215572	And I'm not saying that that's what anybody in this room was doing.
7216112	7228841	I am saying that I have been hearing nothing but people bitching all week about stupid shit that they could just say something and it would be fixed.
7230017	7231298	Thanks for watching!
7252216	7256339	And I've been accused of being bitchy about it.
7256959	7257600	But you know what?
7257760	7263404	I really have... You know how much sympathy I have for the incessant complaining without doing shit about it?
7264665	7265065	Zero.
7266806	7268047	Mother Teresa, you ain't.
7268527	7269928	Well, Mother Teresa was a bitch.
7274640	7275840	Only on this program.
7276281	7276501	No.
7277242	7283547	Mother Teresa liked to make people suffer because it made them closer to God.
7284888	7285588	This is true.
7286689	7291033	That's why all of her little hospitals were nothing better than hubbles.
7291773	7295256	She wouldn't deliver medicine and would do nothing to ease the pain.
7295316	7298018	I didn't mean to open a can of worms during the FU.
7298099	7299600	Mother Teresa was a bitch.
7300945	7302988	What if you were suffering from starvation?
7303048	7305371	Wouldn't that make you closer to God because you're dying?
7306293	7307615	In her opinion, yes.
7308775	7309896	Also, Gandhi was a racist.
7310576	7311097	But, anyway.
7311137	7312638	Less controversy, more angst.
7312818	7313458	Well, that's true.
7317180	7327307	At any rate, it's just, you know, like, for example, I have a friend who says she's going to listen to the show and never does.
7328148	7329128	And you know who she is.
7329709	7331290	I'm not going to say on the air.
7332310	7337734	Who, at work, does nothing but complain about work.
7339407	7341250	about the same thing over and over again.
7341610	7345996	She complains about her family the same thing over and over and over again.
7346356	7348279	And it's the same crap that she does too.
7348399	7353466	And we're like, well, you know, all you have to do is this and you can fix it.
7355849	7357351	Same thing over and over and over and over again.
7357970	7359712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7371826	7377027	You know, nothing, you know, and also, and also, this goes in with it as well.
7378107	7383349	I also don't like for people to look for a crutch, you know what I mean?
7384389	7392311	To put all of their hopes in one place and expect that that is going to be the end all, oh my god!
7393511	7410678	and I would like to right now offer an apology to our president the very awesome and we have a handsome president too but I would like to apologize to President Obama on behalf of all the fucking morons who thinks he can fix all the shit that's wrong in the government
7411585	7412726	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7436576	7437357	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7457873	7459215	I bought 10 cans of cat food, by the way.
7476846	7485830	to help these people who were fostering homeless cats at their own house in a no-kill shelter because they were trying to do some good in the world.
7486651	7489292	And because I believed in what they were doing, I contributed.
7489512	7491753	You know, it's cat food as an example.
7492493	7496535	But I'm just saying, you know, if you want something bad enough, make it happen.
7497256	7499797	It is a bummer, though, the economy didn't magically change overnight.
7501589	7503370	did really who expected it to?
7503431	7510236	if anyone expected it to, they're fucking stupid I know, hopefully soon alright, any more?
7511016	7528990	we gotta move on no, I'm sorry for ranting that's alright, Loki a few Rockstar games for making a crappy PC port of Grand Theft Auto 4 just reiterate that until I fix it and a few to the Spring TV lineup for having too many damn shows on that I need to watch that happen to be on at the same time I can't do that
7529329	7532630	And you can't keep putting out cool shows, because then I get distracted.
7533370	7533950	That's not good.
7534351	7544694	I can't watch American Idol, Lie to Me, Nip Tuck, House, possibly Heroes, although it's supposed to suck this season, but I still gotta see how bad it's gonna suck.
7546414	7551576	Fringe, and some stupid dance competition show.
7552156	7553076	So you think you can dance?
7553536	7556217	No, it's that International Dance Stars or something like that.
7556237	7557798	It's got the Grooves on it, so I wanted to watch it.
7557818	7559118	Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
7561145	7561445	Is that it?
7561825	7562245	That's it.
7562385	7562765	My F.U.
7562805	7564486	goes to the headache I have setting in.
7564586	7565046	Boo hoo.
7565066	7566986	I'm going to have to go run in the house and take some ibuprofen.
7567046	7569827	Otherwise, I don't have a lot of F.U.s.
7570107	7573528	I'm in just like a mood.
7573688	7573828	F.U.
7573848	7574688	to being blow.
7575948	7576849	That's what I feel like.
7576909	7577789	I feel a blow.
7577809	7580969	There you go.
7580989	7582350	Alright, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week.
7583770	7585150	More angst next week.
7586311	7586851	Blow.
7587291	7587751	Blow.
7589645	7590125	and DarkSakura.
7616912	7617953	I don't want to get on that tangent.
7618834	7620115	I will talk instead about this.
7620515	7629523	We were mentioning, or the chat room, I should say, was mentioning, when DarkSakura was talking about Obama, somebody had made the comment about he's the first president that did his addresses on YouTube.
7629803	7631425	TigerClaw said that in the chat room.
7631705	7634147	Obama is the first president to post YouTube videos of his addresses.
7634567	7636609	So very interesting how YouTube has come a long way.
7636629	7638991	They're also on the Xbox Marketplace, too.
7639412	7640493	All the different...
7641013	7644335	All the inauguration stuff.
7644535	7645096	MSNBC.
7646497	7650419	Also, this is something I was watching on CNN.
7650980	7651700	I think it's cool.
7651920	7654622	I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this coming out of the White House, too.
7655683	7662107	He said that he wanted to be much more transparent and available for the public.
7662507	7664549	He said the president is a public servant.
7664629	7665309	That's true, right?
7665970	7668111	I think we're going to be seeing a whole lot more.
7668551	7670573	There's actually a Spider-Man comic with Obama in it, too.
7672074	7674736	But then didn't he not let cameras in when he retook the oath?
7676718	7680161	I don't think that was him Just in case he fucked up again No, he didn't fuck up
7680876	7684498	The guy repeating it... I know what I... He said it right.
7684938	7687080	The dude repeating it to him fucked up.
7687120	7689041	It was just one of those awkward... Fired!
7689341	7690862	I don't want to get too political.
7690902	7693303	I just thought he just smiled and was like, did you screw up?
7693423	7704010	I don't want to get too political, but the whole fact that they had to do it a second time was ridiculous anyway, because there's an amendment in the Constitution that says Obama was president, whether he said, I like cupcakes up there on the stand or not.
7704230	7706531	Which I do approve of that message.
7706871	7708412	That should be the new inauguration.
7708552	7709353	I like cupcakes.
7713280	7718222	I'm saying my point was look for more of this.
7718302	7727385	I think we're going to see a whole lot more of this massive internet interaction with our government coming up.
7727425	7728165	So I think that's pretty cool.
7728365	7734389	Well, speaking of massive interaction, there's a whole version of Street Fighter that you can play on YouTube.
7734869	7736530	I believe it's some type of tie-in.
7736770	7737771	Yes, on YouTube.
7737811	7741574	I believe it's some type of tie-in with Soda Toys or whatever because they keep featuring this.
7741874	7743795	But it's interesting, and I'll play it here in the background here.
7744155	7745536	It's like this whole little Street Fighter thing.
7745936	7750859	And as you play it, you can click on a button while it's flashing to make a move.
7750919	7753461	It uses like the branching YouTube technology or whatever.
7753801	7755142	And so I can select my fighter.
7755202	7757444	So let's pick Zangief because he's the gay one.
7758104	7758824	So I clicked on him.
7758844	7762046	And it took me to Zangief versus Guile.
7762626	7764367	And now all the buttons are flashing, I can do stuff!
7764767	7772911	So, like, I clicked Y. And it took me to another video where I got punched in the face by Guile, but I'll click A now and try to hit him again.
7773691	7774831	And I get to hit him in another video.
7774851	7776892	Where I got kicked in the face again!
7777012	7777933	I am not very good at YouTube.
7777953	7779113	Because you have to hit it when it flashes.
7779914	7780834	I hit it when it flashed.
7781054	7781975	No, you stopped.
7781995	7782195	See?
7783235	7783355	Oh.
7783495	7784616	You have to hit it right when it flashes.
7784656	7784736	Go.
7788226	7789027	Oh wait, I'm Guile.
7789067	7790407	I'm playing against Sangief, huh?
7790627	7791528	So I guess that's a good thing.
7793669	7794230	Woohoo.
7794970	7797271	Anyway, so it's like this whole little interactive Street Fighter game.
7797551	7802354	The user's name, if you want to see this, Patrick B-O-I-V-I-N.
7802754	7805716	Unfortunately, there's no real easy way to link a YouTube.
7807917	7808398	But that's it.
7809298	7811199	Interactive Street Fighter on YouTube.
7811840	7812420	Kind of interesting.
7812800	7815482	You know, there's something, though, that I actually am curious about.
7815522	7817163	Did you ever play Mugen?
7818919	7820961	That was the fighting creature on Fighter, right?
7820981	7829147	That was a long time ago when the chat was talking about there should be an all games interactive versus Orange Lounge Radio like fighting game and they were going to do it in Mugen except nothing ever happened.
7830008	7838074	Well, I actually, I've kind of got an idea for doing an Orange Lounge inspired Mugen.
7839055	7840316	There'll be more to come from this.
7840516	7848503	I would like to speak to people who are familiar with doing custom characters for Mugen and sprite editors.
7850319	7850699	That's all.
7852420	7854082	But how about some different stuff?
7854282	7856143	Jason's yelling at me in chat saying, what the fuck?
7856163	7857504	There's no easy way to link to YouTube.
7857584	7858625	Link the first video.
7859045	7861927	Now, I can do that for you guys in chat, but remember, it's a radio show.
7861987	7868732	I can't exactly sit here and go, okay, go to YouTube.com, uppercase L, uppercase P, you know.
7871194	7873715	I can't exactly read that little garbage code there.
7874096	7874676	Anyway, sorry.
7875777	7877098	That's what tiny URL is for.
7877546	7877926	I guess.
7878087	7879888	Even tiny URLs kind of pokey.
7880709	7880949	Anyway.
7881230	7883271	You know what one of my favorite games was though, Rob?
7883311	7883652	What is that?
7883672	7884713	When it came out a few years ago.
7884773	7885093	What's that?
7885393	7886815	Hydro Thunder!
7887215	7889277	Dude, that game is still at a lot of arcades.
7889297	7892300	It's like one of the only actual arcade games you see in arcades.
7892780	7894961	I freaking love that game.
7895421	7898042	And I played the crap out of it on Dreamcast.
7898102	7898663	Hell yeah.
7899323	7900263	Well, guess what?
7900764	7907086	There's going to be a spiritual successor to Hydro Thunder called H2 Overdrive.
7909007	7909327	I know.
7909688	7916231	But I'm looking at pictures and it looks like totally like how Hydro Thunder looks.
7916251	7917472	It basically is Hydro Thunder.
7917492	7919293	They remade some of the levels from the original game.
7919313	7920793	So why didn't they just call it Hydro Thunder 2?
7920994	7923135	Because someone owns a trademark for that.
7924115	7924936	Oh, lame.
7925236	7928838	This is supposed to be out, I think, by Raw Thrills.
7929598	7936862	So they actually should be seeing it at the ATEI Expo in London to, you know,
7937422	7941883	If any of our listeners in London are going to be there, do take pictures, please.
7943684	7945124	But yeah, it's official.
7945164	7949445	In fact, 1UP has a preview of it with the video and everything.
7949725	7951586	So, check it out.
7951626	7952926	Coming to an arcade near you, maybe?
7953466	7954407	I will sew there.
7955187	7955527	We'll see.
7955687	7956547	Sounds awesome.
7956887	7958868	It's going to be in the corner of all the Pete's Places now.
7962498	7970685	So there was some games talked about during Ubisoft's financial earnings conference call.
7973652	7974953	Assassin's Creed 2 A new Ghost Recon game
7997725	8000928	Of course, Beyond Good and Evil 2, because that's already been announced.
8001749	8010276	And also, they let another title slip that they weren't supposed to talk about, but Red Steel 2 is going to be coming out at some point.
8012839	8013980	Now with Wii Motion Plus.
8015761	8017002	How did that slip in there?
8017283	8018204	Oh, by the way, Red Steel 2.
8019164	8022107	No, he's like... I forget what it was.
8022227	8022467	It was...
8024911	8028834	We have lots of products coming for the Wii next fiscal year.
8029415	8033938	We have Red Steel... Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that.
8034098	8036480	GS68 in chat calls it Red Shit Teal 2.
8037821	8039142	Red Steel was very disappointing.
8039482	8041344	This isn't a surprise, though.
8041364	8043045	I've heard them talk about Red Steel 2 before.
8043605	8045447	They have to fix a lot of stuff if they're going to do that.
8045887	8046928	But you know what, though?
8046988	8048869	Conduit looks awesome.
8048889	8050430	I don't know.
8050471	8050851	We'll see.
8051491	8052292	Maybe they can do it.
8053758	8063260	Alright, well, when I was telling you my Warcraft story earlier about how I, you know, left and everything, I assured you I did not do it to go back to Final Fantasy XI.
8063840	8067821	And after some news this week, Lord knows if I could, I might have been banned.
8068361	8071942	Because apparently tons of the hardcore players were banned from Final Fantasy XI this week.
8072802	8079084	Although, just joking, obviously I would not have exploited a cheat in the game as these people did that got banned.
8079504	8081146	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
8096967	8102052	and Squeenix finally did some emergency maintenance on November 26th.
8102092	8102993	That was a while ago.
8103453	8107897	They went back, I guess, for all those logs and all that stuff and figured out who did this.
8108358	8114524	They temporarily suspended 400 players and 550 players who committed serious misconduct.
8114964	8115765	We ban you!
8116426	8117386	You can never play again.
8118297	8118997	So there it is.
8119338	8123840	Apparently a lot of these banned players were long-time Final Fantasy XI players.
8124680	8125180	So who knows?
8125240	8126161	Maybe they did you a favor.
8130623	8136585	No, but that's got to really suck to put a lot of time into a game like that and then suddenly wake up banned one day.
8138524	8142729	and I get told in chat by my buddy Miklatov says, you couldn't if you wanted to, Rob.
8142749	8144030	You never made it to Endgame.
8144451	8144851	That's true.
8144891	8145952	I never did make it to Endgame.
8145972	8148395	I played how many years of Final Fantasy XI and I never got to Endgame?
8148775	8150517	Nine months of WoW and I was in Endgame.
8150897	8156724	And it sounds like if I played on Jamie's pirate server, I could probably get to Endgame content in Ragnarok in about an hour.
8157705	8158786	No, no, no.
8158806	8160368	Sounds like 20 minutes.
8161107	8162468	No, not even that, actually.
8162548	8173972	It's like you can get to level 150, no problem, after rebirth, but it does take longer to level to 255.
8174692	8175812	But that's interesting, though.
8175832	8186476	I mean, man, you could say, hey, they cheated, they deserved it, but that's very interesting that they let this exploit go on for so long and then they retroactively did that.
8187143	8187943	You know what?
8188103	8193646	If they're not hacking the game, if it's just like a bug in the game that did that, I don't think they should punish them at all.
8193686	8202289	I mean, to be honest, if it's your poor programming that's caused this duplication glitch, I think you should fix it and that's the end of it.
8202469	8203470	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8225393	8250008	and this guild found this way to exploit the boss fight by I don't know you drag him to some type of lava or something and basically if you just let it go on and on and on for five hours you can win this fight so it's more of an endurance thing but you have to do it for five hours so they exploited it got the title for doing it because you get a title if you do it bragged about it on the official WoW forums and found themselves with a temporary ban
8251929	8255011	All the people that were involved and got a rollback on the clock because of it.
8255511	8256132	That's kind of lame.
8256692	8264858	I remember when I was playing on IRO, if there were item duplication and things to happen like that, they'd do rollbacks.
8265938	8266579	Yeah.
8267339	8273883	Or, because you can't really, doing an inventory wipe of just one character would be kind of... Crappy.
8274764	8275244	Alright, anyway.
8276325	8278025	Well, that's going to do it for our stories tonight.
8278066	8282948	We will get to last-minute stories very soon, but we do want to open it up to you guys and let you guys have a say and give us a call.
8283228	8285369	If you want to give us a call, our Skype line is open.
8285449	8287390	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8287470	8291491	That's 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll-free in the United States and Canada.
8291892	8293492	Or you can give us a call on our Skype.
8293692	8296354	It's Orange Lounge Radio is the name on Skype.
8296954	8300856	And we have opened up the Skype line, and we're waiting for your calls.
8301696	8307792	And so while we wait for the buffer from our live chatty to get to the people listening so they know it's open, do we have a quick last minute story, Loki?
8308240	8312802	Yeah, remember that patent that they had for a directional sensing DS card?
8313082	8317363	Well, apparently it's being used for some stargazing app that's coming to Japan.
8317523	8318844	That could be kind of interesting, actually.
8318884	8320404	Well, the app's actually pretty expensive.
8320444	8322565	It's 8,190 yen.
8322625	8326427	Oh my gosh, it costs a lot for that kind of motion sensing technology.
8326827	8328908	It charts over 9,300 stars, planets, suns, and moons.
8329128	8329408	Strange.
8329688	8330748	Hey, we got a call on the Skype line.
8330768	8331248	Let's go to it.
8331328	8332969	Hi, caller, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8333009	8333369	Who's this?
8333909	8335590	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
8335610	8337891	This is that guy that you can probably guess who it already is.
8338993	8341875	In case there's people listening for the first time, you should probably introduce yourself.
8342175	8343096	Hi guys, I'm Jason.
8343316	8343856	Hi Jason.
8343896	8345537	Jason, our fearless webmaster.
8346077	8347478	We're getting a new website soon, right?
8347978	8348278	We are.
8348519	8349819	I'm so freaking excited.
8349839	8351060	Have you talked to Deke?
8351140	8357704	We're going to have to come up with a title for him too because Jason is the webmaster, but Deke wrote the site.
8357804	8359785	So now we're going to have to think of a title for Deke too.
8361482	8361782	I don't know.
8361942	8366265	I was kind of trying to mull that over in my head and I hadn't come up with anything yet.
8366785	8367305	We'll think about it.
8367525	8369827	But definitely, credit is very important in all of this.
8370007	8371407	Yes, very, very important.
8371427	8373228	And we have to think of a way to thank him publicly.
8373308	8374049	So we'll think of something.
8374449	8376230	Anyhow, Jason, what did you call about tonight?
8376790	8379912	I don't know if you guys talked about this in your gaming weeks.
8379972	8381033	I didn't see it in the show role.
8381373	8386536	People aren't supposed to know that you can see what we talk about before the show.
8387799	8388860	I have secrets.
8389640	8391041	Alright, what's up?
8391061	8392182	Special privileges.
8392682	8396565	So, Konami Digital Entertainment released a certain demo.
8397625	8399947	I don't remember if it was last week or this.
8401384	8420672	is it sparking any uh have you guys already talked about this last week yeah during my gaming week last week i mentioned i'm assuming you're talking about dance dance revolution light s or whatever it's called was this seriously last week yes actually here's the thing konami put out the press release this week but the game's actually been on the store for like 10 days
8421906	8422807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8444640	8450483	You see a little placeholder for United States and I think, I'm assuming Britain, but there's nothing there.
8450503	8451424	You can't press them.
8451604	8453625	You can only go to the Japanese site, which I can't understand.
8453985	8459748	So I thought when I saw the press release... There you go.
8460829	8462010	He's actually going into it right now.
8464271	8469494	My thought was that you would go to the website now that they put the press release out and you could actually look at the website now.
8469534	8470394	But no, that's not up either.
8470434	8473216	So I don't know why they waited until now to put out the press release, but they did.
8474580	8475561	I'm just that behind.
8475661	8479743	I only saw this... I just kind of stumbled across it during the week.
8480023	8484446	Did you know there's also a Silent Hill game on the store?
8484606	8491570	I think I saw it and I just didn't get it because I went to see... I went to their company little section of the iTunes store and I wanted to see what else they put up.
8492031	8492171	It's...
8493081	8497463	It's not even... They slapped Silent Hill sprites on a 3D maze game.
8497523	8498903	It's not even anything.
8498943	8501384	Although the music's kind of cool, so I guess there's that.
8501885	8503825	Yeah, and Touch Konami still has not changed.
8503865	8507707	Japan is deep black, and United States and Europe are gray, and you can't do it.
8507867	8508807	That's right, can't do it.
8509027	8510828	Well, what did you think of the demo?
8511208	8512209	So what did you think of the demo?
8512229	8514470	I already talked about it last week, and now you know to go back and listen.
8514510	8515750	But what did you think of the demo?
8516470	8520292	It sure is hell more impressive than any other mobile version of the game that's come out yet.
8521462	8523326	The Xbox version had a better frame rate than the iPhone 1 does for me.
8532643	8533524	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8555246	8557768	Perfect Attack, those songs on real DDR.
8557948	8560910	I can't even get a full combo yet on the phone version.
8561030	8563352	Yeah, I haven't managed to combo it either.
8563392	8563993	It's tough.
8565354	8566054	But it's a demo.
8566094	8566534	It's free.
8566594	8567435	It's hard to knock it.
8567475	8568716	DDR fans will eat it up.
8568856	8573479	Depending on how expensive it is, I'm considering getting it when they actually release it.
8573619	8576742	That is what they're trying to sell their finalized product on, so we'll see.
8577996	8599775	and it's it is technically impressive for what it is there's a character in the background I haven't actually sat down and really started memorizing it to see if it's random or not but there's a nice series of visualizations uh everything in the game looks damn near the the way it should be the way it has been a character in the background the music quality is beautiful uh
8600177	8626696	it's impressive and I just have to see how much they're going to charge for it when it actually comes out you have to remember despite all my bitching about song list and everything I mean frame rate and everything you have to remember it's a freaking cell phone game and not bad for a cell phone for a cell phone game alright anyhow and like I said especially compared to all of their other mobile releases thus far which is also a very hard comparison but it's still very valid true any other thoughts Jason before we let you go
8627635	8628915	My arms hurt a whole lot.
8629195	8629716	Sorry to hear it.
8629736	8631236	I hate reading furniture.
8631596	8639258	I was going to make a masturbation joke, but I guess since you've actually moved, you have a legitimate excuse, and I'll let you go just this once without making a joke at your expense.
8640178	8641558	Alright, bye Jason.
8642038	8642298	Night.
8643719	8644459	You want to give us a call?
8644479	8648520	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8649040	8650400	Loki, another story to tide us over?
8650834	8651374	Yeah, sure.
8652175	8652636	Let's see.
8653116	8659321	Well, there's another WiiWare title that we forgot to talk about, Pulse Big Adventure, which is coming from Sega.
8660202	8662684	It is a parody of a bunch of 8-bit games.
8662824	8674994	It takes place, I guess, it's developed by the Phantasy Star Universe producer, and there are 100 hidden gags in the game, including, for example, if you eat a mushroom, your character will grow beyond the size of the screen.
8675134	8683876	Very ironic, considering DarkSakura was just a minute ago talking about, you know, in part A, I should say, about an hour ago, talking about a 8-bit parody Sega game.
8684176	8684816	Oh, I'm sorry.
8685117	8685917	No, no, no, no.
8686017	8688257	I mean, she was talking about, like, Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
8688277	8689198	That's not what I'm making reference to.
8689218	8690898	It's just funny that all these years... And Mario.
8691278	8691498	Yeah.
8691738	8696079	Also, I'm watching a little big plan at Super Mario Sack Brothers level.
8696419	8697640	I've played that level.
8697700	8698160	It's interesting.
8698220	8699140	Anyway, the phone lit up again.
8699160	8699660	I want to go to it.
8699920	8700740	Hi, caller.
8700780	8702181	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
8702221	8702601	Who's this?
8703955	8705015	This is Spazinator.
8705595	8707076	Hey, Spazinator, what's on your mind?
8709016	8711677	I just want to double check and make sure I heard you right.
8711737	8715117	Did you just say earlier in the show that you gave up WoW?
8716538	8717338	Run that by me again.
8718638	8720939	Did you say that you gave up WoW?
8721459	8727960	Yes, earlier in the show on Part A, I'm taking a long, extended, long, long break from WoW.
8729212	8733415	DarkSakura, I may want to check to see if you're like breaking a fever or anything like that.
8733435	8734476	You know, that doesn't seem to really...
8755859	8769928	You know, make a whole lot of sense, you know, simply because I know you are a big fan of WoW and DarkSakura is a big fan of Ragnarok, you know, you guys give real folks games and it seems a lot of place, you know?
8770519	8778126	I'm a huge fan of WoW, but I was a bigger fan of the people that play WoW and the people that I interacted with in my guild, but it's not like I'm dead.
8778407	8782290	And many of those people I already knew before I played WoW and I will continue to know.
8782771	8786474	But WoW was just getting to the point where it was like a second job and...
8787555	8788616	I just need to take a break.
8788716	8789857	I'm not knocking the game.
8789977	8794360	Blizzard has put a phenomenal game out there that people give a lot of unnecessary shit to.
8795621	8799644	For the show, this is going to be great because I've got a million video games to catch up on.
8799985	8800525	It's going to be great.
8802426	8814415	For what it's worth, I know you kind of touched on it a little while ago, but if you're looking for another MMO, personally, I can recommend Final Fantasy XI.
8814535	8814595	It
8815868	8825050	You know, at least on the two servers that I'm on, which are Odin and Alexander, there's a lot of really great people on there.
8825070	8836693	We're constantly doing stuff, whether it be stuff for the new expansion, Wings of the Goddess.
8836853	8838893	I gotta say this, Spazinator.
8839433	8842634	Loki and I actually played Final Fantasy XI for like three years.
8843857	8845238	for an ungodly long time.
8845979	8854887	I hear a lot has changed in the time I was away while I was gone in WoW and a lot of it sounds really interesting but it's just kind of a place I'm not really interested in going back to.
8854947	8856449	But again, not knocking the game.
8856649	8858531	There's a lot of great things about Final Fantasy XI.
8858691	8859812	I hope you guys have a blast.
8860112	8864256	But I think for me right now, I don't want to quit an MMO to just go play another MMO.
8864656	8867359	At least until the Star Trek MMO comes out.
8867739	8868059	Yeah, true.
8868099	8869380	Well, thanks for taking my call.
8869440	8871902	I don't want to take up too much more of your time.
8871922	8874084	I mentioned there's probably a lot of people trying to call in, so...
8896258	8897299	Thanks for the call, Spazinator.
8897359	8898199	Have a good one.
8921020	8923082	A comment from RicePrincess who's listening right now.
8923102	8924163	Of course you love RicePrincess.
8924223	8925344	She was here last week.
8926285	8929187	If Rob's going to play an MMO again, it's going to be Hello Kitty Online.
8929727	8931849	Very tempting, Hello Kitty Online.
8932049	8933330	Very tempting to at least look.
8933731	8934792	There's Hello Kitty Online.
8935132	8935872	Yeah, I believe it's free.
8935892	8936273	I think it's free.
8936393	8937274	I might have to do this.
8937654	8938014	You know what?
8938034	8940016	Other one looked interesting.
8940036	8941357	1877 GameOLR, Orange Lounge Radio.
8941477	8941997	What, DarkSakura?
8942578	8943739	I like Hello Kitty.
8944679	8945040	Me too.
8945381	8945601	Loki?
8946062	8949609	I was going to say they keep advertising that free... What is it?
8949649	8952616	Fusion... I think Fusion Fall or something like that.
8952696	8953718	The Cartoon Network game.
8953998	8954479	Oh, yeah.
8954499	8955241	I don't know.
8955936	8960597	You know, again, I have such a huge backlog of, like, Xbox and PlayStation 3 games I need to play.
8961498	8962958	I don't want to look for another MMO right now.
8964359	8975942	The only exception I might make is something like, actually, something like Phantasy Star Online actually sounds like a lot of fun because, you know, as DarkSakura said, you can play it forever or you can play it for, like, five minutes, pretty much.
8975982	8977082	You know, just do one little area.
8977742	8980463	That sounds more tempting than anything else I've heard so far.
8981364	8982304	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8982324	8982624	Who's this?
8984935	8985816	Yellow, Dammit
9003406	9004246	What was I going to say?
9005487	9009808	Well, I've played a few more PC games.
9011329	9014530	Plus, I haven't quit WoW.
9016151	9018432	And speaking of WoW, I haven't quit WoW either.
9018832	9022794	But this month I can't play because I'm too poor to actually pay for it.
9023634	9028397	Other than that, what was I going to say?
9028577	9028797	Fear 2.
9032375	9034837	The demo was released.
9035517	9047866	Yes, somebody sent me a Twitter message telling me I had, I don't know if it was you, somebody on Twitter, I think it was Twitter, sent me a message, Twitter or Facebook, sent me a message saying you need to check out Fear 2, it's the best demo I've played in a long time.
9048026	9054991	I did queue it up on my PlayStation 3 to check out, so I will definitely see that for next week, but I'm assuming you've already played it.
9056092	9060855	Yeah, I played it, of course I played it on a PC, and
9062339	9075788	Ooh, it, it, well, it has, the most funny thing, the thing is that, well, the last five minutes of the demo is really kicking ass.
9076768	9083813	I'm not even sure if I'm going to spoil it, but, well, you get to pilot this mecha thingy.
9085394	9088076	You get to pilot a mech thingy?
9089364	9094127	Yeah, you get to pilot some sort of robot, whatever... Strange.
9094948	9095148	Huh.
9095708	9111378	Now, is it actually... Especially since, if I remember right, the developers of Fear 2, Monolith, has, like, ain't there, like, they released an old game of theirs called, what is it, uh...
9112364	9116448	Shogun, Mobile, Assault, whatever, yada yada, something.
9117048	9123614	Which was a hybrid of a bit of everything.
9124875	9132983	Since in that game you could pilot big robots, and they are quite big fans of piloting robots.
9133944	9136346	Here's my question about Fear 2.
9136706	9137467	Was it scary?
9139639	9140880	Yes, it was.
9142300	9157086	Even though, well, if you're gonna play it on PS3, I don't even know, but I will say this, apparently it requires the almost hefty computer to play.
9157847	9168351	Even though I can say that, well, I've played it on my old, one of the first generation Core Duo 2, and it rolled just fine.
9169110	9177032	but then again I didn't crank it up until like massive so hmm and what more?
9177312	9189555	oh yeah, Dawn of War 2 has been the multiplayer beta for that has started oh and how's that going?
9190795	9198737	that's going just fine it's really like well it's sort of
9199329	9199790	and so on.
9217512	9221855	Hear our story earlier about the brick-and-mortar store GameStop, huge here in the U.S.
9221875	9222756	I don't know if you have them over there.
9223297	9228160	Refusing, well, rumor, refusing to sell this game in their stores because of the digital distribution.
9228180	9229281	Do you think that would hurt this game?
9231202	9236787	Well, here's the other thing, is that, well, I don't even...
9239836	9240396	It might do.
9240756	9241976	But here's the other thing.
9243277	9249880	First of all, I got into the beta due to the following fact that I did bought Soulstorm on Steam.
9250600	9261165	And since THQ does have most of their games on Steam, or at least a few of them, that was due to that.
9262557	9265438	Tabula Rasa has entered its free play state of something.
9265458	9270079	That would be a good one, because at least I know the plug's going to get pulled on Tabula Rasa before too long, so I can't get that sucked into it.
9289625	9290446	Good suggestion.
9290806	9292408	All right, Ake, we've got to let you go, buddy.
9292728	9293308	But have a good one.
9294109	9296031	All the way from Sweden, my friends.
9296151	9298613	Ake Ripper giving us a call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9298633	9300254	We love hearing from the international listeners.
9300355	9301095	It's always a good time.
9302216	9305099	Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR in the U.S.
9305119	9309643	and Canada or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9309703	9311344	Do we have another last-minute story, Loki?
9311625	9311845	Yes.
9312703	9315404	I am very excited about this news.
9332148	9343577	Mario Kart with custom levels Oh yeah, that'll be awesome Good times, good times Let's go to the call of phones Take one more call before we're out of here for tonight Hello, you're on Orange Sounds Radio, who's this?
9344417	9347079	Legend of Zaku Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
9348340	9357087	Nothing much, just spending another lazy Sunday at home Me too But I do this internet radio show thing on Sunday nights, I don't know if you've heard
9358800	9363541	But yeah, I guess basically it's been going off with Microsoft and everything.
9363662	9374845	Pretty much you reap what you sow in terms of delivering products which basically call for people to get laid off.
9375885	9380627	Oh, are we talking about the whole Windows Vista being blamed for the recent Microsoft layoffs?
9381457	9386640	I guess, well, either that or they're just trying to like, you know, trying to outsource the rest of the jobs.
9387300	9394024	But besides the point, it just sucks to see that, you know, the folks at Flight Simulator, the folks who created Flight Simulator are pretty much getting canned.
9394742	9396463	I mean, they didn't have anything to do.
9396483	9398504	That's a damn good tool for pilots.
9398544	9400265	That's a game I remember from when I was a kid.
9400625	9406008	Not only is it a game, but it's like a resource for people who are really big into flying.
9406128	9406808	True, true.
9407309	9408529	It's hard to call that a game.
9408589	9410050	It really is a simulator.
9410810	9414852	But it can be considered a game in that sense.
9415013	9415793	I mean, you do it.
9416700	9422104	To each his own, whoever enjoys flying around for several hours in a virtual plane.
9422484	9424266	No, I'm not into hip-hop, unfortunately.
9447517	9471686	I mean, there are certain songs in 2DX, for example, you know, certain other songs that are, like, you know, faster to scratch on, like, ah, damn, I wish I could name them off the top of my head, but, yeah, I mean, it's each his own, I guess, as long as it allows a person to actually, you know, literally scratch on the DJ, I mean, on the turntable.
9472600	9483303	And if the controller for it is actually any good, if it's just like Kraken DJ with only two turntables and maybe a crossfader, it could be a lot more realistic than 2DX.
9483323	9487084	Besides that, download that Fear 2 demo.
9494625	9498908	I don't care for what system you have, PS3, 360, or PC, get that shit.
9499128	9499508	Yes, sir.
9499528	9500128	Just get it now.
9500269	9500729	Yes, sir.
9500769	9501569	Get it fucking now.
9501890	9503391	I'll do it, because Zaku told me to.
9504131	9505272	All right, Zaku, you have a good one.
9506372	9506613	Yep.
9510615	9511476	Have a good one, Zaku.
9511616	9511796	Yep.
9514199	9514739	He's awesome.
9517260	9519241	Several OLR listeners I've met in person.
9519641	9522602	In fact, I am trying to get back to New York City this year, just a heads up, folks.
9522762	9524963	I don't know when, but it's one of my goals.
9525723	9528364	If I told you why I'm really going to New York City, though, you'd laugh at me.
9528404	9531285	But I do have a friend that lives out there, as you all know, and I'm trying to get back out there this year.
9531465	9532405	Want to hear something awesome?
9532545	9533266	What's that, Louie?
9533486	9539788	Well, we're thinking of, because I remember I have that company vacation that I can take, that $1,500 one.
9539988	9540168	Yeah.
9540308	9542929	So we were going to go to Seattle, but...
9543709	9546191	It's kind of boring if you just go there for Seattle.
9546211	9547151	I love Seattle!
9547171	9548472	Yeah, whatever, okay.
9548832	9550774	Okay, so we're thinking going to Disneyland instead.
9551934	9557018	But now, since Conan O'Brien's taking over for Jay Leno, he films in L.A.
9557338	9558879	Uh-huh, that's true, that's true.
9559179	9559960	When's he starting?
9560340	9560760	In the summer?
9561601	9562381	Soon, I think.
9562681	9565663	I mean, they're already saying he's filming in L.A.
9565683	9567545	You're going to spend your $1,500 vacation on L.A.?
9567565	9569906	I mean, no offense, but you can drive to L.A.
9569946	9570807	on the weekend, for God's sake.
9570827	9572568	Well, Nelly hasn't been there yet.
9574841	9577483	You should go to the East Coast.
9577624	9579005	New York City is a wonderful place to go.
9579025	9580846	Yeah, but the thing is, they only cover $1,500.
9580946	9583408	I mean, that's the flight right there.
9583729	9585290	We don't want to spend it.
9585310	9587351	No, you can get a JetBlue flight out of Sacramento for $250.
9589059	9589319	Disneyland!
9610057	9611157	and Disneyland is pretty fabulous.
9611197	9613478	We would go to Disneyland and maybe Universal Studios.
9613898	9620460	I do want to see Conan though since my dream to go to Price is Right with Bob Barker hosting is long past.
9620980	9622361	You should still go to Price is Right.
9622761	9625221	I would love to see Loki and the wife on a game show.
9625502	9626502	That's what I want to see.
9629161	9634003	You guys need to go on one of those low-budget game shows like Lingo.
9634183	9635823	I don't have the game show appeal.
9635863	9642005	I'm not like some crazy redneck or like, you know... Dude, you do a radio show on the internet about video games.
9642065	9642705	That's a pretty awesome niche.
9642745	9643626	And no one gives a shit.
9644166	9645226	No one gives a shit.
9645266	9648127	You tell them that, they're like... Yeah.
9648707	9649788	You're not in the military, are you?
9650068	9650308	No?
9650808	9653629	Sorry, you go back to the audience portion of the...
9654672	9655953	I don't know.
9656093	9657834	They would never call me on one of those shows.
9659516	9661397	It'd be awesome, but no, they would never do that.
9661637	9662818	Never, ever, ever.
9663298	9668742	It's just like I've given up on getting the Employee of the Month thing at my work because that'll never, ever happen.
9669062	9669483	I love this.
9669763	9672805	D5T1, I don't know if there's an easier way to pronounce that in chat.
9672845	9675227	D5T1 suggests Supermarket Sweep.
9676688	9678249	Hey, dude, Supermarket Sweep is awesome.
9678269	9679089	Is that still on TV?
9679209	9680871	I don't know if they make new episodes.
9680911	9682372	I think it's on PAX or something.
9682412	9682652	I think...
9683760	9686222	Surely, is that guy still hosting shows?
9686242	9686842	He could be.
9686923	9687783	They could still be doing it.
9687803	9688824	Supermarket Sweep's awesome.
9689785	9690665	I'd go to the supermarket.
9690685	9692967	Dude, Loki would like load that cart up with those turkeys.
9694468	9695069	Be awesome.
9696650	9698752	I think all of us want to go on Supermarket Sweep.
9698772	9700293	Who doesn't want to go on Supermarket Sweep?
9702855	9709220	Hold on, I'm actually, thanks to the powers of Wikipedia, I'm looking it up right now.
9710510	9712292	Uh, no, it looks like it went off the air in 2003.
9712352	9716096	They probably still run it in repeats, but that's that.
9716356	9717137	2003 is when it stopped.
9717217	9720801	And I don't hate New York, it's just it's so damn expensive to travel there.
9721102	9724405	It's not... New York was my first pick.
9725506	9729231	And it was just, you know, it wouldn't work out as far as, like, you know...
9730856	9732417	We don't want to spend our own money.
9732557	9738880	And the problem is that $1,500 can only be used on the hotel and on travel.
9739320	9744422	And I don't think we can do... It's all weird because it has to be booked through Expedia and stuff like that.
9745142	9745523	I don't know.
9745623	9746583	It's lame.
9746763	9749644	I'm going to find you a fun $1,500 trip that's better than L.A.
9749925	9750845	I'm going to make it my mission for $1,500.
9751145	9753266	Well, there's only certain cities I can go to.
9753846	9754167	All right.
9754187	9754427	All right.
9754447	9754707	We'll see.
9754727	9755047	We'll see.
9755447	9757509	I actually am going on vacation again.
9758771	9761434	I wanted to make sure that I said something about it.
9761834	9763696	Not really a vacation, it's more like a family visit.
9764377	9765458	Going to Washington.
9766940	9768221	To Prosser, Washington.
9768241	9770483	Wait, does that mean you're going to be gone next week?
9770984	9771244	Yes.
9771805	9772626	Oh, what a bummer.
9773587	9773867	Yes.
9774608	9774908	Alright.
9774928	9777391	I doubt I'll have internet or anything.
9778154	9779414	Well, gosh, DarkSakura.
9779434	9781235	I'm going to visit Dan's family.
9781555	9786377	No offense, Ranma, I'm not going to go crash with you if I travel to New York City with my wife.
9786897	9788658	No, that's not going to happen.
9788778	9791679	Him and the wife want to have lots of sex while they're on vacation.
9791759	9793580	They're not going to do it in your spare bedroom.
9793640	9797061	No, if we're going to go on vacation, we're going to go on vacation in a nice hotel and stuff like that.
9797081	9799062	We're not going to just go crash at someone's house.
9800499	9803683	That's something like if I was going to an anime convention or something in New York City.
9803723	9804624	Plus, Nelly would freak.
9804865	9806747	Yeah, if it were just me.
9807027	9807828	You don't know the wife.
9808269	9812334	If it were just me traveling to New York City for something, then yeah, that would be probably fine.
9812374	9814277	But, you know, not with the wife.
9814357	9815358	No, that doesn't work that way.
9817600	9818200	Alright, anyhow.
9819001	9820962	We gotta wrap up the show and get the hell out of here.
9821942	9823103	Get everybody's final thoughts.
9823223	9827685	DarkSakura, welcome back and see you next in two weeks, I guess.
9828045	9835028	What a bummer, because next week we have the... Bobby's not on the air, so we got a lot of time to kill next week, so we'll see what happens.
9835489	9837069	But enjoy the trip to Prosser.
9838850	9839470	We're driving.
9840191	9841071	It's a pretty drive, though.
9841091	9841732	17 fucking hours!
9846297	9847017	Make the best of it.
9847057	9847637	Take pictures.
9847878	9848358	Bring it back.
9850058	9851119	Get to be with your hubby.
9853019	9854940	Any final thoughts on the show before we go?
9857201	9857981	I want some ice cream.
9858961	9860002	Ice cream does sound delicious.
9860242	9860782	Very delicious.
9861883	9868805	My final thought is the only thing better than ice cream is that ice cream that was made out of Samoas.
9868845	9870085	And I don't care what they call them now.
9870586	9872266	The Caramel Delight sort of the crap Samoas.
9873527	9874367	Loki, what's your final thought?
9874790	9878093	Final thought is I need to find a song for Cagematch.
9878193	9879974	I know which song I want, but it's in my car.
9879994	9881996	Dude, I think you won the last time we did a Cagematch.
9882357	9886240	Well, I also like the song by Uncle called Burn My Shadow.
9886300	9893126	It's in the new teaser trailer for Fuel, which is going to be the next kick-ass racing game I'm really into.
9894267	9900872	Basically, from the creators of Dirt and Grid, they're doing a racing game basically that's in an alternate...
9901593	9910102	Future where weather has changed the face of earth and basically you're like racing through tornadoes and shit.
9910502	9911984	So that sounds awesome.
9912825	9915508	And then they actually have a video of racing through tornadoes.
9916108	9917730	So I'm down with that.
9920929	9922490	Oh, this is kind of a bummer.
9922570	9924571	Final thought from YYR in our chatroom.
9924591	9926891	Of course, he's the man who made Snake360.
9926911	9927952	We had him on the show a few weeks ago.
9928352	9931213	As of right now, the Snake360 contests are now over.
9931753	9935275	F you to the major gaming sites for not covering them because not enough people entered.
9935655	9938236	I can't even give away all the prizes.
9939136	9939416	Bummer.
9939756	9940256	Sorry to hear it.
9940776	9941537	We'll take your prizes.
9942357	9946958	But no, in all seriousness, as I was telling somebody, I gave somebody advice earlier in the week.
9946978	9951639	You've got to remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, so sometimes it takes a long time.
9951659	9960781	We did OLR for many, many years with only like a dozen people listening before we finally broke it and got two dozen people listening, and that's about where we're at now.
9963211	9973486	No, but again, and I say this at the end of every show, remember, it's the community that helps make Orange Lounge Radio, and without you guys, life would suck a lot, and we would not be as motivated to do the program.
9973506	9977071	So thank you guys, as always, for tuning into this program and spending your Sunday nights with us.
9978533	9981914	Please, if you like the show, all we ask, tell two friends about the show.
9982274	9990077	Help us spread the word because, again, we don't have any major... We don't get covered by the major gaming sites either unless they're accusing Loki of breaking an NDA or something.
9990817	9992438	We don't get any coverage from major gaming sites either.
9992738	9994599	So we only get word of mouth.
9994759	9995359	That's really it.
9995419	9998760	So leave us a nice review on iTunes or any other podcast site.
9999060	10000701	Help spread the word for Orange Lounge Radio.
10001101	10005703	But until next time, myself, DarkSakura in two weeks, and Loki next week.
10005723	10006363	We'll be back.
10008430	10009836	See you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10011317	10014078	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10014618	10017859	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
10018280	10026923	To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.
10027423	10039027	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but were probably right anyway.
