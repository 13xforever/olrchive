659	1120	All right.
1520	4584	And we're not going to do much of an afterbirth tonight because the show went on so long.
4684	9730	We're having stream problems, and I think I have a cage match pick from Jamie, but I'm not sure.
9810	12694	So we're just going to say screw it and kind of move quickly tonight.
12734	19182	But Victoria did walk back in studio, so I wanted to give her a chance to say any last things she wants to say to the listeners.
20086	22267	It was fun being on the show.
22668	29432	Rob's been trying to get me to come on the show for a while.
32274	33254	It was fun.
33354	36176	I've never really tuned in to listen.
36917	38518	How nerdy is this, seriously?
38558	39238	It is.
39298	40479	You're a nerd factor.
40499	42540	You just got deeper into the nerd forest, my friend.
42560	44902	Do you think we'll have a camera next time?
45502	46883	Yes, we should have a camera next show.
47323	49045	We got sent one from one of our listeners.
49105	49685	Thank you, thank you.
50806	53207	AkumaJP, I believe, was the one that sent it.
53648	55409	And DarkSakura has it, though.
55449	56489	She's going to bring it with her next week.
56510	61713	I'm hoping... I mean, they're going to leave us... Like I said, I'm checking out the game Scratch this week.
62133	64495	And they're leaving us a... It's...
65228	67608	A presentation deck.
68089	72029	It's basically the DJ deck, but I think it's missing all the internals out of it.
73249	74850	Because they wouldn't give me the actual deck.
74910	77730	That would be kind of generous of them.
80251	83611	I don't know if I'm able to bring that in, but I may if I can.
84351	84871	I'd be sweet.
84891	85632	If they don't care.
89232	89712	It was fun.
90052	92193	I did kind of get a headache from all the nerdiness.
92253	92753	I'm sorry.
92773	93773	You suck.
94542	95543	But, you know, I love you.
96103	97004	And this is fun.
97344	99245	You know, I got to hang out with Irene and Matt some more.
100806	101527	So, yeah.
101947	103789	Thanks for letting me be on your show.
103889	104829	Muchas gracias.
105129	105530	De nada.
105930	106250	All that.
106430	106931	We've done this.
107031	108772	You can't believe we've done this almost seven years now.
108932	109833	You have no life, my friend.
109853	111434	The very first night we ever did this.
111454	112435	Do you know how many people listened?
112555	112875	How many?
113055	113455	Twelve.
113776	114076	Nice.
114696	115317	Twelve people.
115737	116578	And honestly, it's not.
116618	117158	We probably have.
126707	128208	about 70 that listen live now.
128228	129168	Hey, it's more than 12.
129228	132329	Yeah, but I mean now thanks to the podcast we have hundreds.
132509	134830	Or two weeks ago we would have done it tonight.
134870	135390	Can I be Brett?
136010	139732	You can be anybody you want, but two weeks ago we did Video Game Match Game and you missed it.
140232	142032	You don't have to really know anything about video games though.
142052	142993	People say random shit.
143293	143973	Oh, fun.
144013	144973	And I know you love Match Game.
145073	146334	I fucking love Match Game.
146574	149615	Rob and I are going to be Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly for Halloween.
149715	151175	Yeah, that's your Halloween costume this year.
151476	151876	Be awesome.
152856	154397	Alright, so there's no cage match tonight.
154417	155218	I'm sorry to say.
155438	156139	We gotta wrap up.
156179	157440	I mean, it's already almost 10 o'clock.
157480	158400	We've been on air four hours.
158440	159701	The podcast is gonna be huge this week.
159741	160642	It's over three hours.
160682	163024	I don't think we've had one clock past three hours in a long time.
163524	164465	But we had a fun time.
164785	165646	Thank you guys very much.
165966	166667	Bye, guys.
166967	169188	I do have a fortune cookie message of the day for you all.
169829	170369	So here it is.
170570	172291	Does it say go fuck yourself?
172571	172731	No.
172951	174673	Here's the fortune cookie message of the day.
201477	201877	That's it.
201997	203738	That's it for my fortune key message of the day.
204918	206179	I love the Syphil and Ollie show.
206219	206699	It's awesome.
207279	207919	So there you have it.
207939	208859	Did you say Romy and Michelle?
208959	210280	You wanted me to do the Romy and Michelle?
211770	216533	Alright, we'll do two fortune cookie messages today just because I love you that much.
216553	217534	Oh, I love this.
217554	218194	I love you that much.
218474	222137	No, I posted this in my live journal and I said... You were watching Romeo and Michelle yesterday.
222217	225919	Yes, I said, I don't know why, but this clip just seems to sum up my life.
226399	226960	So here it is.
234685	234865	Hi.
234885	234925	Hi.
236431	237792	Hey, um, great suit.
238353	239233	Is that an Armani?
239434	240635	Yes, yes it is.
241235	241956	I thought so.
242796	243637	So what do you do?
244238	245619	I'm a suit salesman.
247521	248581	Would you excuse me?
249222	252165	I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood.
256769	257109	Be funny.
257169	257370	I know.
257390	261354	You have to actually watch it because of the limp she has as she walks away.
261494	262735	It's kind of crappy.
263556	265138	So everybody.
265678	266119	So that's it.
266519	267140	We're pulling the plug.
267420	267780	We're done.
268161	268521	Bye, guys.
268541	269042	We're out of here.
269422	270703	So we'll see you next week.
270763	272145	Same bat time, same bat channel.
272265	272946	Jamie will be back.
273326	273967	We'll talk more.
274808	276329	Another friend of mine wants to come on the show.
276850	277330	So we'll see.
277350	277590	Matt.
278891	279231	We'll see.
279371	281093	The one that was here for New Year's.
282335	284117	He wants to come talk about PC games.
284898	285579	We'll have that.
285960	286901	It'll be fun.
288182	289284	It'll be cool.
289324	289644	That's it.
289865	290225	We're done.
