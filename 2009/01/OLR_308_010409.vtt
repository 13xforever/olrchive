00:17.380 --> 00:22.240

00:22.240 --> 00:32.400
your old hdvd player into a burning laser?

00:32.400 --> 00:35.380
Hi everybody and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio.

00:35.380 --> 00:40.360
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
lifestyle.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.920
I should say welcome to a new year of orange lounge radio because you know haha it is 2009,

00:45.920 --> 00:48.360
our first show of the year.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.600
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you tonight.

00:50.600 --> 00:55.480
As always, my faithful co-hosts, partners in crime, say hello to the one and only dark

00:55.480 --> 00:56.960
sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:56.960 --> 00:57.960
Snorlax.

00:57.960 --> 00:58.960
How are you Snorlax?

00:58.960 --> 00:59.960
Hey.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.960
Hey.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
I'm doing okay.

01:01.960 --> 01:06.920
You know I was having a conversation about Pokemon and WoW the other day, don't ask,

01:06.920 --> 01:10.160
but have you ever seen the Pokemon Jynx?

01:10.160 --> 01:11.160
No.

01:11.160 --> 01:16.920
Jynx looks like a giant drag queen, google it, google Jynx Pokemon, it's hilarious, anyway

01:16.920 --> 01:20.280
sorry I'm completely random like the rest of the show.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.440
Say hello to our very own drag queen here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

01:23.440 --> 01:27.640
I'm sorry you must be talking about Andrew right here.

01:27.640 --> 01:33.680
I'm sorry I was just imagining you dressed as Tingle because it's seemingly never going

01:33.680 --> 01:35.640
to happen so I just have to imagine it.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.640
Alright.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
How are you?

01:37.640 --> 01:40.920
I'm doing fine, it could be better if this would work correctly.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.560
Oh yeah I forgot you have a cam over there, god pointed at my worst possible angle.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.560
It's not working.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.560
Oh that's good.

01:47.560 --> 01:52.200
Because you know like all things Sony it crashes out there a few minutes.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.240
So yeah.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.840
Trying to use the Eye of Judgment for something useful and failing failtastically.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.760
Well yeah it failed just as fast as the Eye of Judgment within about five minutes.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.760
Gotcha.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
Amazing.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.840
Also joining us tonight we do have some guests in studio as Loki already mentioned we have

02:06.840 --> 02:12.760
the OLR forever intern Drew is here in house and we'll have to steal Loki's microphone

02:12.760 --> 02:13.760
to be heard.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.760
What's up?

02:14.760 --> 02:15.760
Hi how are you?

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
Not bad not bad.

02:16.760 --> 02:17.760
Cool cool.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.680
How was your new year?

02:19.680 --> 02:20.960
Pretty quiet.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.680
Champagne got to see how Dick Clark's progressed.

02:24.680 --> 02:25.680
That's about it.

02:25.680 --> 02:26.680
Yeah not good.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.680
Not good apparently.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.680
Prognosis?

02:28.680 --> 02:29.680
I'm a little sad about that.

02:29.680 --> 02:30.680
You old.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.680
Yeah.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.680
Alright.

02:32.680 --> 02:38.780
Also joining us tonight all the way from the city that never sleeps Las Vegas say hello

02:38.780 --> 02:47.880
to T-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-A-R-R-A-R-R-R-A-R-R-A also known as Sauce.

02:47.880 --> 02:48.880
How are you Sauce?

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
I'm doing pretty good.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.880
How's Vegas?

02:50.880 --> 02:54.040
It's Vegas like it snowed a couple of weeks ago and everybody freaked out.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.320
It doesn't snow in the desert like ever.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
Fun times.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.160
Yeah but you're spending the week in Sacramento?

02:59.160 --> 03:01.740
Yeah this is actually my last night here.

03:01.740 --> 03:02.740
Nooo.

03:02.740 --> 03:03.740
Well how was your new year's?

03:03.740 --> 03:04.980
It was fun.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.360
We play a lot of rock band.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.880
Yeah good times.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.800
Now you're at a website now where you talk about all sorts of nerdy things, so you actually

03:11.800 --> 03:14.520
have something to plug tonight, so why don't you plug away?

03:14.520 --> 03:21.480
Well, I have a game slash comic slash book slash other geeky nerdy stuff.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.600
It's a nerd blog.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.600
It's a total nerd.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.000
Anything nerdy, it's there.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Yeah.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.600
It's AvengersTower.com, and actually Jamie made an account on there too, and she's posted

03:32.600 --> 03:34.760
a review on some comics.

03:34.760 --> 03:39.800
So it's just kind of a fun place for all of your nerdy stuff to kind of converge together,

03:39.800 --> 03:45.600
and you'll probably occasionally see references to that one episode of Star Trek The Next

03:45.600 --> 03:46.600
Generation where...

03:46.600 --> 03:47.600
Nice.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.600
Very nice.

03:48.600 --> 03:53.560
Well, best of luck with the blog, and if you want to see two cute nerdy girls giggling

03:53.560 --> 03:57.660
and screaming about comics and things, no, I'm just kidding.

03:57.660 --> 03:58.660
It's a fun read.

03:58.660 --> 03:59.660
You guys are very good writers.

03:59.660 --> 04:00.660
Thank you.

04:00.660 --> 04:01.660
Good luck with that.

04:01.660 --> 04:04.120
It's probably even better than Orangenolenceradio.com, so definitely check it out.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.120
All right.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.480
Let's start off with how is your gaming week?

04:07.480 --> 04:11.200
So Dark Soccer, since you're all big time writing for a big giggling girl blog now,

04:11.200 --> 04:16.560
why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
Giggling Geek Girl.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.560
I like that.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.560
No, I'm just kidding.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.560
No.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.440
I played, of course, Rock Band on New Year's Eve, and that crappy Lips game that was full

04:26.440 --> 04:31.080
of crap and crappiness and songs that I hate.

04:31.080 --> 04:36.320
See, I would have thought Lips was awesome because it's by the Elite Beat Agents people,

04:36.320 --> 04:37.600
but you were not a fan.

04:37.600 --> 04:41.500
It has a bunch of pop bullshit that I hate.

04:41.500 --> 04:48.120
As in, when I went in the room and had to ask, what is this and who is that, then that's

04:48.120 --> 04:54.760
a sign that it's stuff that I don't listen to.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.600
You made me play Sing Star Abba today.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.480
Yes, it was amazing.

04:59.480 --> 05:04.200
The girls came over before tonight's show, and we sat down with some Sing Star Abba.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.720
It was epic, as Abba would be.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.480
Here's the thing about Dark Soccer, though, is that she does this whole, oh, I don't sing

05:10.480 --> 05:11.480
in front of people.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.480
I don't like to sing.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.680
I don't really want to play.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.320
So Tiara and I basically put a gun to her head and said, look, you're going to sing

05:18.320 --> 05:21.520
or else, and she said, oh, okay.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.720
She got up there and sang, got a higher score than Tiara and I. Probably combined, she got

05:25.720 --> 05:26.720
a higher score.

05:26.720 --> 05:31.480
I think she got 8,500 on the Take On Me song or something.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.480
I don't know.

05:32.480 --> 05:39.080
On her first song, she got 8,000 on whatever Abba song she was singing, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.920
She's totally one of those people that's like, oh, no, I couldn't possibly, and then she's

05:42.920 --> 05:45.360
like, oh, my God, she's amazing.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.360
No, it's okay.

05:47.360 --> 05:51.520
This is the thing, and I'm sure I've explained this before, I hate hearing out of tune, and

05:51.520 --> 05:54.720
I hear myself out of tune, and it drives me nuts.

05:54.720 --> 06:01.160
And I think everyone else can hear it because I hear it, so I don't really want to do it.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.320
And singing in front of people has been ruined for me forever because of church choir.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.320
I see.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.660
Well, so that explains then why we're shy, and at least you can change the mic volume

06:11.660 --> 06:12.660
in SimStar.

06:12.660 --> 06:13.660
Yeah, that was helpful.

06:13.660 --> 06:17.720
It's just because I didn't want to hear myself that loud, but I played other stuff.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.160
I actually turned on Order of Ecclesia and then turned it off because that was when Becky

06:22.160 --> 06:27.180
arrived because I was just starting to play, and then it's like, oh, hi.

06:27.180 --> 06:33.940
So we watched Eddie Izzard, and then we played a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance,

06:33.940 --> 06:37.520
and by a whole crap ton, I mean a whole crap ton.

06:37.520 --> 06:45.640
It was fantastic for, um, sorry, hee hee hee hee hee.

06:45.640 --> 06:48.040
What the hell else did I play?

06:48.040 --> 06:53.080
I gotta go to chat room because leave it to chat room to make some tee hee type comments.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.680
Chat.orangeontrader.com, the ever-present extra guest on the program.

06:56.680 --> 07:02.160
Black Wolf, our buddy, who is on right before us at allgames.com, and I should work in this

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
plug for him.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.640
He's starting a new project next week on Friday.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.000
It's Friday Night Gaming, FNG, that effing show.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.880
Now I can actually call it that effing show, and he can't get mad at me.

07:11.880 --> 07:16.420
It's FNG, fnglive.net, and he has a comment tonight.

07:16.420 --> 07:20.280
He says, the game obviously didn't hear you sing out of tune, because that's right, you

07:20.280 --> 07:21.280
got a high score.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.960
Obviously you weren't out of tune because the game didn't grade you out of tune.

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
Just had to say that.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.760
Well, yeah, okay, but it's...

07:27.760 --> 07:31.160
It's probably forgiving, so she has another reason to be self-deprecating.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.160
Thank you!

07:32.160 --> 07:34.680
I want ice cream now.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
Anyway.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.880
Let's all go out for ice cream after the show.

07:37.880 --> 07:38.880
Actually they brought ice cream.

07:38.880 --> 07:39.880
Yeah.

07:39.880 --> 07:40.880
Damn.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.000
But, um, but, I, um, what else, what else the heck did I play?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.800
Oh yeah, I was starting to play more Ragnarok, and then I was like, damn this intro's long!

07:48.800 --> 07:53.360
So um, I'm still on the, uh, opening part of the game where they do a whole shit ton

07:53.360 --> 07:54.920
of talking.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.280
And um, um, um, um, I played something else.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.600
Oh yeah!

07:59.600 --> 08:03.080
Big Buck Safari.

08:03.080 --> 08:07.120
We went- What?

08:07.120 --> 08:13.720
We were waiting on our food at, um, the Beach Hut Deli that, um, well I don't wanna...

08:13.720 --> 08:14.720
Well, they're great.

08:14.720 --> 08:18.440
It's up on, on, uh, was it on Madison up there?

08:18.440 --> 08:19.440
On Greenback?

08:19.440 --> 08:20.440
Wherever?

08:20.440 --> 08:24.720
Anyway, um, we were waiting on our food, and I was like, I wanna shoot an elephant!

08:24.720 --> 08:30.400
So, cause it was the tropical one.

08:30.400 --> 08:36.480
So I got up there, and, and, thank you for the 50 cents by the way, and um, I, there,

08:36.480 --> 08:41.120
you couldn't shoot elephants to start, so I picked a wildebeest, and kept, you know,

08:41.120 --> 08:42.320
wanting to shoot the wildebeests.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.880
But they were stupid, and it's like, if you shoot, you can only shoot the buck, you can't

08:46.880 --> 08:47.880
shoot the cow.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.320
I said, you shot a cow, moo!

08:51.320 --> 08:54.000
But I shot a lion in the ass.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.960
I like nipped his ear, and he turned and ran, so I shot him in the ass.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.160
And then I shot an elephant in the head.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.160
Even though I wasn't supposed to shoot the elephant.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.920
This is what Africa should be.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.800
That's what I said!

09:04.800 --> 09:09.400
I was like, this game is what Africa needs to be, only it was kinda craptastic, but it

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
was pretty funny.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.800
And, you know, I just wanna remind people that all these Safari games we play, they're

09:13.800 --> 09:17.360
all crap compared to Jambo Safari, honestly, when all's said and done.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.360
Jambo Safari is great.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.200
Yes, Jambo Safari is one of those amazing, great games that we'll never shut up about

09:22.200 --> 09:23.640
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:23.640 --> 09:28.440
Like file it under, like, Guardian Legend and SingStar Abba, because it's right up there.

09:28.440 --> 09:33.720
And then, um, I, I, our Turbo Express is low on battery, and we need to do batteries for

09:33.720 --> 09:37.360
it, but I really wanted to play R-Type on, uh, earlier in the week.

09:37.360 --> 09:45.760
I didn't get to play R-Type, but, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh, but, I did get, I told you I got Katamari

09:45.760 --> 09:49.960
for my iPhone, and I played some.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.080
Is this fail-tastic, as a lot of people were saying, or did they really fix it?

09:53.080 --> 09:54.520
I heard they fixed some stuff.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.540
It's still kinda hard to control, I haven't done story mode yet, I've just been doing

09:57.540 --> 10:00.720
endless to get used to the controls.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.880
I don't like tilting it, I wish that I could just, you know, slide my thumb in one direction

10:05.880 --> 10:11.360
and have the, the Katamari go that way, but, it's alright, it's not bad.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.800
It actually, I can't really notice a lot of the framerate problems that people were talking

10:14.800 --> 10:20.520
about, because the, um, first one kind of had a few of those on its own, so it really

10:20.520 --> 10:26.160
isn't all that big of a deal, it's an iPhone app, deal with it, shit.

10:26.160 --> 10:32.120
You know, you wanna play Katamari that doesn't have that problem, freakin' get a PS2.

10:32.120 --> 10:40.760
Alright, I like that review, it's an iPhone app, shit, deal with it, alright.

10:40.760 --> 10:41.760
Let's move on.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.800
I'm gonna type that up right now.

10:43.800 --> 10:48.280
You do that, put that in the Giggling Girl blog, alright, just kidding, alright, let's

10:48.280 --> 10:51.540
move on over to Loki, Loki, how was your gaming week?

10:51.540 --> 10:58.420
My gaming week was okay, um, I played a lot, well I tried playing some Grand Theft Auto

10:58.420 --> 11:05.760
on PC, Grand Theft Auto IV, and for some reason, you know, I was trying to get some of the

11:05.760 --> 11:09.880
mods to work in, it just doesn't like doing mods or something, even though I'm not really

11:09.880 --> 11:14.120
changing much, it's just being retarded, so that's kind of annoying, but I did get, like,

11:14.120 --> 11:17.720
some of the, um, no gravity stuff to work, but I was trying to do some really fun stuff

11:17.720 --> 11:20.120
with it, but, oh well.

11:20.120 --> 11:28.720
And then, um, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV on the 360 as well, still playing our, um,

11:28.720 --> 11:37.280
daily games, and I actually tried some new XNA games, uh, one though I really liked was

11:37.280 --> 11:42.680
uh, Carnivale, and I can't remember the rest of the title for that, but uh, Carnivale,

11:42.680 --> 11:49.120
um, it's a really weird kind of game, you play like, Carnivale Showtime, yes, Carnivale

11:49.120 --> 11:58.160
Showtime, it's, um, you play like this, um, acrobat, who's not really human, and you go

11:58.160 --> 12:06.780
around popping balloons, but, they aren't really balloons, yes, sorry, never mind, except

12:06.780 --> 12:10.520
they aren't really balloons, okay, um, no, but you actually, they have these little devices

12:10.520 --> 12:13.920
that swing you around stuff, and the whole goal of it is to pop all the balloons and

12:13.920 --> 12:18.480
get up to, um, the top of the screen where there's a flaming ring.

12:18.480 --> 12:22.040
Now it sounds simple enough, but it keeps getting more and more progressively harder,

12:22.040 --> 12:27.960
and there's other things that are added into it, like rockets and electrical stuff, um,

12:27.960 --> 12:32.120
but for an XNA game it's actually extremely excellent, in fact, I think this thing sets

12:32.120 --> 12:38.560
the bar as far as what XNA games should be, um, totally polished, it could easily be an

12:38.560 --> 12:45.240
Xbox Live Arcade game, easily, um, so highly recommend you check it out, I went ahead and

12:45.240 --> 12:51.360
purchased it cause it was awesome, so, check it out and buy it, cause it's good, and very

12:51.360 --> 12:53.640
fun actually, and really colorful.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.080
So for all those people out there that say you hate on community games, not true, cause

12:57.080 --> 12:58.080
I love this one.

12:58.080 --> 13:01.800
No, this is what I'm saying is, they need to be polished, it's cause a lot of the stuff

13:01.800 --> 13:07.960
I see on there is not very polished, and that's my problem with it, you know, so you have

13:07.960 --> 13:11.560
to look at games like this and go, oh my god, this is what they could be like, then what

13:11.560 --> 13:13.560
the hell is everyone else doing?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.400
That's my thing right there.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.440
Vidpower in chat says, every time somebody talks about a carnival, I think about that

13:18.440 --> 13:22.720
carnival arcade game, and you know, when you said carnival, I was thinking of that HBO

13:22.720 --> 13:26.000
series, like, did they make a carnival video game?

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
No, it's not a carnival video game, no, it's really cool though, it's, um, easily something

13:31.000 --> 13:37.600
though that could be an Xbox Live Arcade game, which it should be I think, but, whatever.

13:37.600 --> 13:45.680
Um, and then other than that, I played a little bit of Dissidia, and a little bit of Animal

13:45.680 --> 13:49.440
Crossing, and that's pretty much it.

13:49.440 --> 13:54.920
I was gonna try to play some other things this week, but I didn't get around to it,

13:54.920 --> 13:56.780
so that's okay.

13:56.780 --> 14:01.840
My gaming week, you know, same old stuff, World of Warcraft, I've now done three wings

14:01.840 --> 14:08.360
on 25-Man Naxx, thank you very much, because of our raiding alliance, but it was fun.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.240
But here's the thing, other than that, you know what game I've actually been spending

14:11.240 --> 14:13.800
like the majority of my game week playing?

14:13.800 --> 14:19.960
Is Suikoden, yes, the old school PlayStation 1 game Suikoden, and why have I been playing

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
that of all games?

14:20.960 --> 14:24.560
Well, they released it on the PlayStation 3, I think two weeks ago, I think Christmas

14:24.560 --> 14:28.800
week as one of the backwards compatible games that you can play on your PlayStation 3 or

14:28.800 --> 14:29.880
the PSP.

14:29.880 --> 14:34.680
And it's kind of a hard to find game now, it was a collector's item for a little while,

14:34.680 --> 14:38.720
I mean, now that it's on PlayStation 3, I'm not sure how that's gonna go, I'm sure the

14:38.720 --> 14:42.720
hardcore collectors will still be after it, but those that want to play it now can do

14:42.720 --> 14:44.560
so for $6.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.960
So it's cool, because I remember playing the game once like a long time ago, I think I'd

14:47.960 --> 14:51.880
rented it, but I didn't really remember it, and you know, one of my really good friends

14:51.880 --> 14:55.680
has been on the show before, Shane, he always raves about Suikoden, and you know, I just

14:55.680 --> 14:58.740
knew that a lot of people really liked the game, so I wanted to play it.

14:58.740 --> 15:04.680
So yeah, I've been playing it, I've already dropped like almost six hours in it, and it's

15:04.680 --> 15:08.400
fun and the story's a lot better than you'd think it is at the beginning when you realize

15:08.400 --> 15:14.600
the graphics are kind of a step up from the Super Nintendo, but that Fortune Wheel boss,

15:14.600 --> 15:16.800
for those of you who have played Suikoden, you'll know what I'm talking about, the Fortune

15:16.800 --> 15:21.400
Wheel boss, seriously, that was the worst thing ever, ever.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.520
But I got past it, but man did that take persistence.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.360
Basically there's a boss, that's a giant roulette wheel, and you step onto it, and you land

15:28.360 --> 15:32.520
on a square that might be a monster, or might be experience, but you're waiting to land

15:32.520 --> 15:35.520
on the square that'll take you to the next room, but you might have to do the damn thing

15:35.520 --> 15:41.440
like fifty times, I'm not even kidding, and do all these random videos, terrible.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.000
But otherwise the game's pretty awesome actually, I really like the concept of going around

15:45.000 --> 15:48.760
and recruiting people to join your army, because there should be an army of supporters that

15:48.760 --> 15:49.880
I have.

15:49.880 --> 15:55.000
Anyway, so that was pretty much my gaming week, it was a good classic, Suikoden.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.120
Drew, how was your gaming week?

15:58.120 --> 16:00.720
Pretty good, I had a cold for most of the week, better now though.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.880
Me too, that's kind of ruined my week too.

16:03.880 --> 16:14.200
I sat and played World of Warcraft, I'm actually a main tank now, one of the tanks for my guild.

16:14.200 --> 16:19.800
I took advantage of the Steam sale that happened at the end of the year, picked up some games,

16:19.800 --> 16:26.200
finally got Portal, finally played through Portal, I mean five bucks, come on, played

16:26.200 --> 16:33.960
through Bioshock, got Team Fortress 2, played that a little bit, Enemy Territory Quake Wars,

16:33.960 --> 16:36.560
and I'm just starting out on Fallout 3.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.120
So I've been a little busy gaming-wise, but it's all been good.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.960
Now Fallout 3 has been one of those games that I want to play eventually, because I've

16:43.960 --> 16:46.920
heard so many good things about it, I didn't play Oblivion until a few months after it

16:46.920 --> 16:50.560
was out and I still loved it later, I'm just thinking of Bethesda games.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.680
Is Fallout 3 seeming to be worthy of all the praise that's been lavished upon it by the

16:54.680 --> 16:56.200
gaming masses?

16:56.200 --> 17:01.600
I'll preface this with the fact that I hate Oblivion, but I like Fallout 3.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.880
It's a damn good game.

17:04.880 --> 17:09.960
It's a little tedious to walk this place and that until you get to fast travel back and

17:09.960 --> 17:16.640
forth, but it's pretty good for a first-person style Fallout.

17:16.640 --> 17:21.640
I kind of miss the holy turn-based thing, but V.A.T.S. takes care of that quite nicely.

17:21.640 --> 17:27.120
All right, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

17:27.120 --> 17:28.120
That's about it.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.760
Well then let's move on over to Sauce.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.760
Hello, Sauce.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
Hello.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.960
How was your gaming week?

17:32.960 --> 17:33.960
It was good.

17:33.960 --> 17:38.720
Earlier in the week I played a lot of Eternal Sonata, which was...

17:38.720 --> 17:43.000
We're having mic issues, if you heard that, no I don't think it was you, I think it was...

17:43.000 --> 17:45.840
One of these mics is like on the fritz, it's on its last legs.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.400
It's the one I told Andrew to use.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.400
Is it?

17:48.400 --> 17:52.760
Yeah, I think that mic is going to go any day now, so sorry.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.880
If you hear random things, sorry about that, live radio.

17:55.880 --> 17:56.880
It sucks sometimes.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.880
Go ahead, Sauce.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.440
So I played Eternal Sonata, which is fun.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.720
I had never...

18:01.720 --> 18:09.440
I just got an Xbox 360 the day after Thanksgiving, so I'm kind of catching up on games that people

18:09.440 --> 18:13.160
have already played before, and that was fun.

18:13.160 --> 18:18.680
And then New Year's Eve we played a lot of Rock Band, or I saw Lips, which I thought

18:18.680 --> 18:22.760
was pretty cool, because there's a lot of poppy music that Jamie hates, but I thought

18:22.760 --> 18:26.080
it was great.

18:26.080 --> 18:31.600
Let's see, we played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was fun.

18:31.600 --> 18:38.440
I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith with Dan, which was also fun, I like that game.

18:38.440 --> 18:46.440
And I wound up waking up like five hours before Jamie or Dan did on New Year's Day, so I wound

18:46.440 --> 18:50.400
up trying out Fable 2, because I'd never played that, and I'm really addicted.

18:50.400 --> 18:54.360
I've been waking up before everyone almost every day since I've been here, and I've been

18:54.360 --> 18:56.400
playing that in the mornings.

18:56.400 --> 19:03.480
And I accidentally killed my first husband, which was fun, oops, I forgot he was following

19:03.480 --> 19:07.520
me and I went to go do a quest to kill bandits, and I accidentally got him killed.

19:07.520 --> 19:13.680
So then I remarried, and then I moved into a nicer house, and then in the gypsy camp

19:13.680 --> 19:18.880
I found a lesbian who was in love with me, so I married her also.

19:18.880 --> 19:26.880
Yeah I got a bigamist achievement for that, so it was fun.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.400
So yeah, that was pretty much my gaming wig.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.880
I heard you named your baby Optimus Prime.

19:31.880 --> 19:37.680
Yeah, I had a baby with my second husband and I named him Optimus Prime.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.800
Awesome.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.320
He likes tofu.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.720
As any growing boy should.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
Alright.

19:46.720 --> 19:56.480
Wow, anyhow, let's get a move on talking about some podcast updates and the show.

19:56.480 --> 20:00.960
There is no show next week, just a reminder, we will not be here live next week, January

20:00.960 --> 20:02.680
11th.

20:02.680 --> 20:07.380
That's because we're on vacation, I'll be out of the state and I think everybody else

20:07.380 --> 20:12.120
just wants a week off after the holidays, so enjoy your night off from OLR.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.260
We will be back however on the 18th.

20:14.260 --> 20:19.800
Also, speaking of which, as far as the podcast feed goes, I know it's been behind and lagging,

20:19.800 --> 20:23.920
but it's all caught up now, so go enjoy all the latest episodes of Orange Launch Radio.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.180
You may have to dig back into iTunes a little bit, pick up all the shows you may have missed.

20:27.180 --> 20:31.740
So everything is all caught up there and is hunky-dory in Podcast World.

20:31.740 --> 20:38.260
So now let's get into tonight's news and stuff and we'll get into a game later on, which

20:38.260 --> 20:42.180
some of our chatters can play and possibly win a fabulous prize.

20:42.180 --> 20:43.180
We'll talk more about that later.

20:43.180 --> 20:46.160
Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?

20:46.160 --> 20:49.040
Alright, well guess what?

20:49.040 --> 20:54.000
The Nielsen company has done a bunch of different polls and one of those polls that they have

20:54.000 --> 21:01.180
tabulated was, what was the most played game console for 2008?

21:01.180 --> 21:06.020
Well congratulations Sony, it was the PlayStation 2.

21:06.020 --> 21:11.820
And that had 31.2% of the market share, which is not surprising because it still has the

21:11.820 --> 21:16.280
largest market share of game consoles out there right now.

21:16.280 --> 21:24.160
Number two was the Xbox 360 with 17.2%, followed by the Wii with 13.4%, which is interesting

21:24.160 --> 21:31.920
because there are more Wii consoles out there than Xbox 360, followed by the original Xbox

21:31.920 --> 21:39.520
with 9.7%, and then sadly after that, the PlayStation 3 with 7.3%.

21:39.520 --> 21:45.160
Wait, so more people are playing the original Xbox than are playing the PlayStation 3?

21:45.160 --> 21:50.000
That's right, the original Xbox, the system they stopped selling a couple years ago.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.920
Ouch, that's too bad.

21:53.920 --> 21:57.400
And then of course GameCube with 4.6%.

21:57.400 --> 22:02.440
So hey, at least they're beating the GameCube.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.760
I notice handhelds aren't ranked in there though.

22:04.760 --> 22:11.280
Yeah, because they think they're talking about home console and, you know, I don't know,

22:11.280 --> 22:14.360
they just didn't consider handhelds I guess.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.480
Because if you talk about handhelds, they ain't got to do like, you know, the iPhone

22:17.480 --> 22:22.280
maybe, and it's just, you know, we'll just ignore the handhelds.

22:22.280 --> 22:27.560
Alright, well, do you think things might change in 2009?

22:27.560 --> 22:30.520
Do you think at some point something's got to overtake the PlayStation 2 eventually?

22:30.520 --> 22:34.640
I'm kind of surprised the Wii wasn't higher up there, I mean, I am and I'm not.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.880
Obviously the Wii's biggest problem is that once the novelty of Wii Sports and all that

22:37.880 --> 22:42.160
wears off, it kind of just sits there and gathers dust, but, you know, there's still

22:42.160 --> 22:46.380
a lot of families, especially at Christmas time, that are all playing Wii Sports together

22:46.380 --> 22:48.120
and stuff, you know?

22:48.120 --> 22:54.480
But, you know, would you rather be, I mean, would people be playing Wii Sports for like

22:54.480 --> 22:55.480
six hours a day?

22:55.480 --> 22:59.960
I mean, there's some people, obviously they'll play more hardcore, like RPGs and stuff like

22:59.960 --> 23:05.840
that, like Fallout, you know, and, you know, Fallout, they could be playing that for hours

23:05.840 --> 23:09.920
at a time and that just kind of goes right by, but the Wii doesn't really have anything

23:09.920 --> 23:14.240
that takes up tons of time, I mean, Animal Crossing, but hell, that gets boring after

23:14.240 --> 23:17.440
a couple hours, so.

23:17.440 --> 23:21.240
It's not really that big of a surprise.

23:21.240 --> 23:25.640
I guess all those people that are playing Wii Fit, or not playing Wii Fit, or not playing

23:25.640 --> 23:29.640
Wii Music, very funny.

23:29.640 --> 23:35.720
Rob has escaped us.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.640
Rob ran away while I was having network difficulties.

23:37.640 --> 23:42.200
Sorry, live radio folks, I tried to go fix the network by plugging in the extender, which

23:42.200 --> 23:45.680
I had unplugged earlier in the week because it was causing me issues of the PlayStation

23:45.680 --> 23:46.680
3.

23:46.680 --> 23:52.360
Boy, 2009, not off to a good start in regards to the technical difficulties, is it?

23:52.360 --> 23:54.760
We have mic issues and network issues.

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
Good lord.

23:55.760 --> 24:01.560
Hey, but one thing that's not having issues, it's growing and growing is XNA and the community

24:01.560 --> 24:03.240
games on Xbox Live Marketplace.

24:03.240 --> 24:06.240
What are you laughing about over there, Saws?

24:06.240 --> 24:09.040
My lame transitions, or what?

24:09.040 --> 24:10.040
Okay.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.040
Anyhow.

24:11.040 --> 24:16.040
Hey, obviously there are just tons and tons and tons of games on the community games list,

24:16.040 --> 24:19.320
and it's kind of hard to figure out, like, what is good and out there to download.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.840
I mean, you know, obviously there's a lot of good stuff out there, but there's some

24:22.840 --> 24:27.920
also not good stuff out there, so trying to be able to sort it all can be a challenge.

24:27.920 --> 24:33.680
Well, this website, gamerbytes.com, actually decided to put together their top 10 XNA community

24:33.680 --> 24:36.760
games of 2008.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.520
It's from gamerbytes.com.

24:38.520 --> 24:44.880
They say, Galax email, Monaco 360, which looks a little bit like Rally-X to me, I don't know

24:44.880 --> 24:45.880
about that.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.880
It's a remake of Monaco.

24:46.880 --> 24:50.400
Oh, it's a remake of Monaco GP, okay.

24:50.400 --> 24:58.160
Cave-In was eight, Star Pilot was seven, Weapon of Choice was six, Hexothermic was five, Duotrix

24:58.160 --> 25:01.440
was four, Johnny Platform's Biscuit Romp was three.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.600
I almost downloaded that today.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.600
Biscuit Romp?

25:04.600 --> 25:05.600
That sounds kind of awesome.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.600
That sounds kind of dirty.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.400
Ultratron was number two.

25:08.400 --> 25:12.800
Which looks like a complete rip-off of Robotron, by the way, but still looks pretty.

25:12.800 --> 25:17.160
And number one was the game that Loki was earlier talking about, Carnivale Showtime,

25:17.160 --> 25:20.120
which must be part of the inspiration for him to download it, maybe?

25:20.120 --> 25:21.120
Yes, it would be.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.120
Ah.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.120
So...

25:23.120 --> 25:25.480
I didn't even know it was on there, because I usually check, you know, quite a bit for

25:25.480 --> 25:29.780
different games, but it must have been something that's just recently added.

25:29.780 --> 25:34.200
How sad, though, that our buddy Aaron in his game Snake 360 did not make the list, but

25:34.200 --> 25:35.200
maybe next year.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.320
He must have been number 11.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.400
I don't know.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.400
Maybe next year.

25:38.400 --> 25:42.560
It's unfortunate, because there's probably so many games out there right now, and there's

25:42.560 --> 25:43.560
nothing really to...

25:43.560 --> 25:47.760
I mean, you can look at the top downloads and stuff like that, but that's kind of skewed

25:47.760 --> 25:48.760
sometimes.

25:48.760 --> 25:49.760
Yeah?

25:49.760 --> 25:50.760
I don't know.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.760
Yeah, it can be.

25:51.760 --> 25:57.060
I wonder if anybody's figured out a way to kind of, like, stack the deck.

25:57.060 --> 25:58.060
You know what I mean?

25:58.060 --> 26:01.280
Nobody's figured out a way to cheat that system yet, or anything like that.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.300
Download the trial a bunch of times, I don't know.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.040
Do you think it would require unique accounts, or what?

26:07.040 --> 26:08.040
Maybe.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.040
I don't know.

26:09.040 --> 26:13.920
But, Jamie, that one game, the Biscuit Challenge, or whatever, that's only at 200 Microsoft

26:13.920 --> 26:15.600
points to download.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.680
Looks kind of like a neat little platformer game.

26:17.680 --> 26:20.520
Maybe I'll have to invest and challenge the Biscuit.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.520
You hear that, fireplace sim?

26:22.520 --> 26:24.520
200 Microsoft points.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.880
Don't need to be 500.

26:25.880 --> 26:29.520
That's ridiculous for stupid, fake-looking fire.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.520
Alright.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.160
Well, I'll have to check some of these out.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.560
I've been falling behind on the community games, and I keep meaning to stay on top of

26:37.560 --> 26:38.560
them, but...

26:38.560 --> 26:39.560
Seriously, Carnevale.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.560
That's awesome.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
Alright.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
I'll definitely make it a point to check that one out.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.880
I even bought a bigger hard drive so I could download more games, so I swear I will at

26:45.880 --> 26:46.880
some point.

26:46.880 --> 26:47.880
They actually had some pretty cool stuff.

26:47.880 --> 26:51.360
They had a music-making program on there now, which is kind of neat.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.360
Hmm.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.360
I'll have to check that out.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.320
Well, how about some other top 10s?

26:56.320 --> 27:03.320
And this is Eurogamer's top 10 games, so we're looking a little bit to the overseas opinion.

27:03.320 --> 27:09.480
But number 10 was World of Goo, which is We Wear in PC, and it's actually something that

27:09.480 --> 27:15.200
I was really interested in, just because it looks so bizarre.

27:15.200 --> 27:22.200
Another, the next one is Guitar Hero World Tour for 9th place.

27:22.200 --> 27:26.320
And I have to use your slow internet to get to the next one.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.320
Really?

27:27.320 --> 27:31.560
There was a lot of people hating on Guitar Hero World Tour when I talked to them.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.560
So interesting.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.560
But this is Europe.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.960
I know, but still, it's not like it's a completely different game.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.560
It's interesting.

27:37.560 --> 27:42.900
Number 8 was Gears of War 2 for Xbox 360.

27:42.900 --> 27:45.120
It was pretty epic.

27:45.120 --> 27:52.360
7, Left 4 Dead, which is Valve's zombie game.

27:52.360 --> 27:56.360
I've definitely seen both of those on a lot of top 10 lists this year, that's for sure.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.360
Zombies!

27:57.360 --> 28:02.800
6 is Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, a pretty shiny game.

28:02.800 --> 28:06.640
That game was pretty awesome and was sadly neglected from a lot of top 10 lists this

28:06.640 --> 28:07.640
year.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.680
That was a pretty awesome game.

28:09.680 --> 28:15.160
5 is Braid from Xbox Live Arcade.

28:15.160 --> 28:19.080
And then, moving forward, I'm surprised it's only at 5.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.240
Number 4 is Fable 2.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.240
Fable 2 is very, very British.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.680
I mean, because it's the spelling and everything.

28:27.680 --> 28:28.680
But anyway.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.400
3, Grand Theft Auto 4.

28:30.400 --> 28:34.100
You all knew it would be up there.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.520
Moving on to number 2.

28:36.520 --> 28:41.440
Number 2 is Fallout 3, which is pretty darn awesome.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.320
And number 1 is LittleBigPlanet.

28:44.320 --> 28:50.360
Excellent choice for LittleBigPlanet, but I didn't hear Rock Band 2.

28:50.360 --> 28:54.040
So they put Guitar Hero World Tour on this list, but they didn't put Rock Band 2 on there?

28:54.040 --> 28:55.040
That's interesting.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.560
Or did Rock Band 2 not get released over there yet?

28:57.560 --> 28:58.560
I don't even know.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.000
Because, you know, the delays and everything.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.480
I thought they got it.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.800
I thought they didn't have nearly the delay we had over here.

29:04.800 --> 29:05.800
Very interesting.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.800
Hmm.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.360
Maybe they were feeling, or, you know, this is just one particular website, obviously.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.040
It's not the whole country's opinion.

29:12.040 --> 29:16.320
But maybe this particular website was, you know, maybe put off by the fact that it felt

29:16.320 --> 29:18.520
like more of an upgrade to the previous Rock Band game.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.520
Don't know.

29:19.520 --> 29:25.880
There was a story, kind of tied in with this too, that Peter Moore was pissed off at EA

29:25.880 --> 29:29.200
because FIFA didn't make the list.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.520
How so?

29:30.520 --> 29:35.680
Because it's a European game, and FIFA soccer always usually is one of those bigger games.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.720
And so he was pissed off that it didn't make the list.

29:37.720 --> 29:41.040
Actually, there was a Top 50 list that they did too, I think.

29:41.040 --> 29:47.120
They had like Mirror's Edge and stuff like that on there, but FIFA's not on the list.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.120
Ouch.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
So bad.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.120
Interesting.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.120
Or too bad, so sad.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.120
Yeah.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.360
Well, maybe that's just a hint to, you know, do...

29:53.360 --> 29:54.360
I don't know.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.080
I didn't play the game, so I don't know if it's good or not, but, you know, I would...

29:57.080 --> 29:59.520
Maybe it's just a hint to do better next time?

29:59.520 --> 30:01.080
I don't know.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.080
Maybe.

30:02.080 --> 30:08.880
The PS3 may not have led as far as console game playing share, but they are leading in

30:08.880 --> 30:12.360
one thing, and that is web browsing.

30:12.360 --> 30:17.020
Between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii, PlayStation 3 has won.

30:17.020 --> 30:20.560
They actually have quite a few people browsing.

30:20.560 --> 30:30.920
Of course, when you compare all the browsing platforms, including PC and stuff, 0.4% of

30:30.920 --> 30:40.000
all web browsing is done on the PS3, compared to the 0.01% that's done on the Wii, so yay!

30:40.000 --> 30:44.400
Go 0.3% or 0.3% better.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.400
Yeah.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.720
What do people actually browse the web for on their TV?

30:48.720 --> 30:52.000
I mean, I can't imagine like checking my email on the TV and stuff.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
That would just be terrible.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.560
YouTube and Pornotube, that's pretty much it.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.560
Exactly what I was gonna say.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.920
YouTube and XTube are pretty much all I can think of, and I will say this.

30:59.920 --> 31:04.640
I actually, you know, believe it or not, I had not seen that whole jizz in my pants thing

31:04.640 --> 31:09.680
from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago that had become a viral video.

31:09.680 --> 31:13.360
So my friend finally made me go on YouTube and watch it, and I did it on the PlayStation

31:13.360 --> 31:18.080
3, and it was much smoother than when I had tried to use YouTube on the Wii before.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.440
So I will say it was superior YouTube on the PS3.

31:20.440 --> 31:25.240
Because they have Flash 9 built into the PlayStation 3 browser, whereas the Wii only has Flash

31:25.240 --> 31:26.240
7.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.240
Oh, okay.

31:27.240 --> 31:32.920
Because certain people that, you know, develop the Wii don't give a shit about online.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.880
I see, I see.

31:35.880 --> 31:39.540
And then I saw the jizz in my pants thing, and it wasn't as funny as they made it out

31:39.540 --> 31:41.600
to be, I have to say.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.160
But it was still kind of funny.

31:43.160 --> 31:48.440
Anyway, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, Google it or something.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.440
Oh.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.440
What?

31:50.440 --> 31:57.040
Totally unrelated, but they have a new Charlie the Unicorn that they did for YouTube Live.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.320
It's hilarious.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.320
It's short, though.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.640
Like a third one?

32:00.640 --> 32:01.640
Yeah, sort of.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.440
It's like a little short thing that they did during YouTube Live.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.400
And they had Rick Ashley in there.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.400
Interesting.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.920
And they were talking in Russian.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.920
Hmm.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.440
Well, we've been keeping our eye on the game blogs this week, and one thing that caught

32:15.440 --> 32:20.480
our eye on one of the game blogs was this story on Joystiq about a study that buff game

32:20.480 --> 32:23.520
characters apparently give men a negative body image.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.980
And you know, this is interesting.

32:24.980 --> 32:29.720
You know why this is interesting, because we hear all the freaking time about women

32:29.720 --> 32:35.520
and the supermodels and the wafer-thin looks and women just want to be beautiful and all

32:35.520 --> 32:40.120
this crap because Hollywood screws up everybody's perception of what's normal and da-da-da.

32:40.120 --> 32:43.220
But you don't hear it a lot about men.

32:43.220 --> 32:48.080
So that's what I thought was very interesting about this story is that it kind of calls

32:48.080 --> 32:52.400
attention to, well, maybe there's guys that get image problems as well.

32:52.400 --> 32:57.120
And apparently, they're quoting a study from researchers at Kansas State University.

32:57.120 --> 33:02.200
And apparently what the study showed is that if you view extreme body images in games,

33:02.200 --> 33:05.080
I don't know what that means, extreme body images in games.

33:05.080 --> 33:13.960
Like, is there, like, plus I wouldn't think, like, you know, muscular men extreme cells,

33:13.960 --> 33:14.960
but you know, maybe...

33:14.960 --> 33:16.920
Depends what market you're marketing men for.

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
Exactly.

33:17.920 --> 33:22.720
It's gonna sell 10%, you know, or it's gonna sell the, you know, women or whatever, but

33:22.720 --> 33:24.920
anyway, I don't know.

33:24.920 --> 33:29.440
Anyhow, but they say 15 minutes of seeing these extreme body images.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.760
It's enough to give both males and females, so it's not just, you know, no, here we go

33:33.760 --> 33:37.600
with women again, sadly, unfortunately having to look at this in the media, giving them

33:37.600 --> 33:39.560
a negative impression of their own body image.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.800
Oh, that's bullshit.

33:40.800 --> 33:41.800
I'm sorry.

33:41.800 --> 33:42.800
You think it's all bullshit?

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
That is bullshit.

33:43.800 --> 33:48.800
I'm playing games with, you know, muscular main characters all the time.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.420
Doesn't mean I want to go work out.

33:50.420 --> 33:51.420
Fuck that.

33:51.420 --> 33:52.420
I'm playing a game.

33:52.420 --> 33:53.420
It's a fictional character.

33:53.420 --> 33:54.420
What the hell do I care?

33:54.420 --> 33:57.480
Well, if you want to know a little more about this, you can actually go to where the study's

33:57.480 --> 34:00.740
actually at, which is on some television station's local website.

34:00.740 --> 34:04.520
And apparently it was put together by a graduate student who organized two study groups of

34:04.520 --> 34:05.520
university students.

34:05.520 --> 34:10.320
Okay, here's the extreme game they were talking about, WWF WrestleMania 2000.

34:10.320 --> 34:14.840
That's an N64 game.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.040
The hell?

34:17.040 --> 34:23.000
Well perhaps, I don't know, perhaps the, wow, the news station must be really short over

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
there.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.120
Perhaps the news station must have butchered something, I don't know.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.920
This is Kansas, after all.

34:29.920 --> 34:35.180
And apparently, you know, I love this quote from the news article, included enormous muscular

34:35.180 --> 34:41.200
specimens such as The Rock, Big Boss Man, and The Undertaker.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.200
Wrestling or gay porn?

34:42.200 --> 34:43.200
You be the judge.

34:43.200 --> 34:44.200
Seriously.

34:44.200 --> 34:50.040
Like, I don't watch a lot of wrestling, but damn, Big Boss Man, like, I think I saw him

34:50.040 --> 34:51.620
at Folsom Street Fair.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.120
Big Boss Man was awesome.

34:53.120 --> 34:56.240
I'm just saying.

34:56.240 --> 35:00.560
By the way, the second study was women and they had to play a beach volleyball game.

35:00.560 --> 35:04.080
Well, that's probably DOA beach volleyball right there.

35:04.080 --> 35:11.640
I mean, Boa, and then the story goes on to say, both male and female subjects viewed

35:11.640 --> 35:15.760
their own bodies more negatively after completing a cycle at the game control.

35:15.760 --> 35:19.540
He said the immediacy of reaction by game players was disturbing because video games

35:19.540 --> 35:21.760
are such a powerful element of popular culture.

35:21.760 --> 35:26.400
But here's the weird thing is that they were playing, like, sports video games.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
It's stupid.

35:27.400 --> 35:32.120
To me, they probably, it's totally skewed as far as what they ask the questions and

35:32.120 --> 35:33.120
stuff.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.600
Do you look as good as this character?

35:34.600 --> 35:39.320
Well, fuck no I don't because I'm not, you know, a fictional character that can, you

35:39.320 --> 35:44.240
know, for example, like women and stuff, this character, obviously the physics of her body

35:44.240 --> 35:45.960
don't exist in the real world.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.080
It's like, come on!

35:48.080 --> 35:49.080
It's retarded.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.720
Absolutely retarded.

35:50.720 --> 35:57.040
And I don't think there's anyone that goes and plays a game of, like, I don't know, Conan

35:57.040 --> 36:02.280
or something like that and then goes and cries because their body is, like, you know, pathetic

36:02.280 --> 36:03.280
compared to that.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.480
Well, you know, I don't want to look like some of these, you know, big guys because

36:06.480 --> 36:08.800
I don't want to be addicted to steroids and crack.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.440
Although I do have to say, though, playing games with lots of guns makes me want to own

36:12.440 --> 36:13.440
guns.

36:13.440 --> 36:16.640
So there is, you know, that correlation.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.480
I wouldn't say that because there's a lot of people out there that are going to use

36:20.480 --> 36:23.600
that, you know, like, oh, it just incites violence.

36:23.600 --> 36:28.560
See this guy on this radio show says now he wants a gun because he plays games with guns.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.560
So he's going to go shoot.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.560
I bought another one, actually.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
Oh my god.

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
Yeah.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.560
G36C.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.560
So now I've got that to go along with my shotgun and my P90.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.560
Wow.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.560
Yeah.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.880
Oh, and my high kappa 51.

36:40.880 --> 36:41.880
Wow.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.560
It's a hobby that I really shouldn't be getting into.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.560
All right.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.560
Let's see.

36:46.560 --> 36:49.280
I'm reading some comments from chatroom message.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.480
J100Matt says, did the N64 just get released in Kansas?

36:52.480 --> 36:53.480
Apparently.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.480
I don't know.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.560
This story had to have butchered something.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.560
Kazowm.

36:57.560 --> 37:01.040
I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.

37:01.040 --> 37:05.200
Kazowm says, I bet every woman wishes they could jiggle their boobs like that.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.000
Probably a referencing dead or alive.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.540
I would think that would hurt.

37:09.540 --> 37:13.400
You know, I've never had boobs and I don't really want to, but I would think that if

37:13.400 --> 37:17.840
you jiggle them a lot, like it would really start to hurt because if I were to try and

37:17.840 --> 37:26.920
jiggle my balls, that would probably hurt after a little while.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.840
Does it hurt if you run naked?

37:28.840 --> 37:32.880
No, it feels quite free.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.560
Well, I don't know.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.560
Let me try.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.560
Wow.

37:37.560 --> 37:41.200
They were playing the old game.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.840
I thought it might have been a mistype or something like that, but it's actually WWF.

37:44.840 --> 37:48.280
I mean, WWF hasn't been around for a while now.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.280
I know.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.280
I know.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.280
This is amazing reporting done.

37:51.280 --> 37:55.060
Yeah, but if you've played one of those wrestling games, you've played them all, they're all

37:55.060 --> 37:56.680
pretty much exactly the same.

37:56.680 --> 38:01.920
So that's probably all they could afford with our dying economy in Kansas.

38:01.920 --> 38:04.440
In between the ramen.

38:04.440 --> 38:05.440
And all that.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.440
Nice.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.720
Seriously, just rent a game.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.720
I mean, god.

38:10.720 --> 38:14.160
It's like, this is 64, what is this?

38:14.160 --> 38:17.200
I don't remember that.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
Alright.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.200
Anyhow.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.200
Sorry.

38:20.200 --> 38:29.560
Bresloll is in chat, a co-host of Saturday Night's Understation Live here on All Games.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.040
He's screaming, Photoshop robs balls.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.200
Why would you want to do that?

38:34.200 --> 38:35.200
Why?

38:35.200 --> 38:37.160
Why would you even suggest that people do that?

38:37.160 --> 38:41.720
Unless you're talking about playing pool and billiard balls.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.720
That's okay.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.720
Or beach balls.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.680
Maybe I'm going on a trip to the beach, I need a beach ball.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.400
Or I'm at Walmart and I'm standing in front of one of those big cages full of balls and

38:51.400 --> 38:56.640
I'm trying to undo the thing at the bottom so that they all roll out onto the floor.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.480
That's okay.

38:58.480 --> 39:01.400
But whatever you're suggesting is not okay.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.280
Because we all know billiards is gay.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.280
Anyhow.

39:04.280 --> 39:05.280
Shoutout.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.820
You have to like knocking around some balls.

39:06.820 --> 39:09.640
Who doesn't like to knock around some balls once in a while?

39:09.640 --> 39:10.640
Hey!

39:10.640 --> 39:11.640
Let's move on with some gaming news.

39:11.640 --> 39:19.360
Well, for those of us who are Xbox owners and are really enjoying the whole, you know,

39:19.360 --> 39:25.440
Avatar thingy that's going around, there's some new accessories to be coming out.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.520
Actually different Avatar clothing.

39:27.520 --> 39:31.080
Your phone talks funny!

39:31.080 --> 39:33.120
Sorry, I'm yelling at Sauce.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.160
Her phone just went off in the studio.

39:35.160 --> 39:40.320
Well, there's basically a rave pack that's going to be coming out.

39:40.320 --> 39:46.460
For the boys, there's a pixel art hoodie, a rave baseball cap, pink sweatbands, green

39:46.460 --> 39:49.440
skinny fit jeans, and dark purple jeans.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.520
I'm sure that you can't use that for the girls.

39:52.520 --> 39:57.360
For the girls, there's a green chunky ring, a red chunky ring, yellow fingerless gloves,

39:57.360 --> 40:03.560
blue fingerless gloves, chunky beaded bracelet, dayglo zebra print pumps, and a rave baseball

40:03.560 --> 40:09.560
cap and none of that sound.

40:09.560 --> 40:18.840
Now you can have your very own rave on your Xbox!

40:18.840 --> 40:23.320
The boys' stuff sounds better.

40:23.320 --> 40:30.440
Fuck a bunch of that.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.440
Let's see.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.600
So which one of those clothing items gives me the ecstasy?

40:33.600 --> 40:37.600
I know, Leo Shannon Chat says, I want to know when the ecstasy pills are going to come with

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
the clothes.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.720
That's the pixel art hoodie.

40:40.720 --> 40:45.560
Kazaam in chat, I was going to say Kazaam because there's too many vowels, says you

40:45.560 --> 40:49.080
can't actually make them not look gay.

40:49.080 --> 40:53.480
I'm not sure if I should take offense to that or not, but whatever, it was funny.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.480
Alright.

40:54.480 --> 40:58.920
Yeah, I mean, seriously, there's a clear difference between gay and rave.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.840
Well, at a rave, everyone's kind of gay.

41:01.840 --> 41:05.640
I don't know if you've ever actually been to a rave, but like, come on.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.120
A cuddle room, Loki.

41:08.120 --> 41:12.160
A lot of raves have a cuddle room, where everybody, you know what they do?

41:12.160 --> 41:13.560
They cuddle.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.560
All night.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.560
That's kind of gay.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.560
Well, yeah, several of your parties have a cuddle room.

41:17.560 --> 41:21.000
They want to grow, but I'm gay, so it's understandable.

41:21.000 --> 41:28.040
Yeah, they want to group the easy chicks, and they're all high on ecstasy, so...

41:28.040 --> 41:29.040
Why not?

41:29.040 --> 41:30.040
Alright.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.040
I know.

41:31.040 --> 41:35.040
Everybody's happy when they're on ecstasy.

41:35.040 --> 41:40.560
Alright, let's move on with some more news, please, before we get letters from angry parents.

41:40.560 --> 41:45.600
Square Enix is bringing their next epic game to Xbox Live Arcade.

41:45.600 --> 41:49.120
Will it feature Cloud or possibly any other Final Fantasy characters?

41:49.120 --> 41:52.640
No, because it's not an epic game, and it's a puzzle game instead.

41:52.640 --> 41:57.160
It's Yossaman Live will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

41:57.160 --> 42:00.560
The game kind of looks a little bit like Bejeweled, except you're supposed to be making triangles

42:00.560 --> 42:02.640
out of the characters.

42:02.640 --> 42:06.680
And it looks like everything has frowny faces on it.

42:06.680 --> 42:10.640
So it's one very unhappy puzzle game.

42:10.640 --> 42:14.240
Except all the other creatures under the sea here, it looks like they have smiley faces.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.640
Why does everything have to have faces is what I want to know.

42:16.640 --> 42:17.640
What do you do?

42:17.640 --> 42:19.840
Is the part of the puzzle putting faces together or something?

42:19.840 --> 42:22.960
No, you actually create triangles.

42:22.960 --> 42:27.480
It's like instead of making four in a row, it's making a triangle.

42:27.480 --> 42:31.960
If everything didn't have faces, you wouldn't want to punch it.

42:31.960 --> 42:32.960
Good point.

42:32.960 --> 42:33.960
Good point.

42:33.960 --> 42:38.160
You know, I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious because the smile on the block is better than

42:38.160 --> 42:42.880
mine, and I might have to go see a counselor because of that, because I'm having issues.

42:42.880 --> 42:47.560
Body image issues from Yossaman Live.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.540
I want my hair to be as spiky as Cloud's.

42:49.540 --> 42:52.600
I'm having issues.

42:52.600 --> 42:58.480
But apparently they're going to have this game come out also on the PlayStation Network

42:58.480 --> 43:00.160
at some point as well.

43:00.160 --> 43:05.600
But right now it's been confirmed for Xbox Live Arcade because there's a shot that shows

43:05.600 --> 43:08.280
achievements.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.960
So that's their hypothesis, I guess.

43:10.960 --> 43:15.040
I'm sorry, here's the comment of 2009 in our chat room right now, and I can say that because

43:15.040 --> 43:16.960
we're only, what, like four days into 2009?

43:16.960 --> 43:20.520
SSJ100Matt says, the cuddle room is like the champagne room.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.760
There's no sex going on.

43:22.760 --> 43:23.760
Funny.

43:23.760 --> 43:24.760
Alright.

43:24.760 --> 43:33.400
Anyhow, hey, Lips download content, Lips, because, you know, Dark Sakura wants to download

43:33.400 --> 43:38.040
more songs for Lips, but actually these songs, wait, these songs might actually get her into

43:38.040 --> 43:39.840
it because these are pretty cool songs.

43:39.840 --> 43:45.800
Where Did Our Love Go by The Supremes, Be Good Johnny by Men at Work, and Let's Groove

43:45.800 --> 43:47.720
by Earth Wind and Fire.

43:47.720 --> 43:48.720
No.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.320
Okay, failed.

43:50.320 --> 43:54.400
Well hey, if you want to download the songs and try it for yourself, they're between 160

43:54.400 --> 43:59.040
and 180 Microsoft points apiece because I guess they have variable prices in Lips.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.040
I didn't know that.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.040
I don't have Lips.

44:01.040 --> 44:02.040
It's the one karaoke game I don't have yet.

44:02.040 --> 44:06.080
It came a little late to the party, pun intended, and I've already dumped a bunch of money on

44:06.080 --> 44:09.840
SingStar, but I imagine someday I'll probably have to pick it up.

44:09.840 --> 44:13.520
There's going to have to be a really good song that comes on download that I just can't

44:13.520 --> 44:14.520
get on SingStar.

44:14.520 --> 44:15.820
Well, here's what you can do.

44:15.820 --> 44:20.500
You can import any other song that you want since you can import any MP3 into it.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.880
But I would imagine, I haven't seen it in action yet, but I would imagine that stuff

44:23.880 --> 44:25.200
works kind of wonky.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.760
Yes, and here's what I want to see.

44:26.760 --> 44:33.080
I want to see someone import in Max 300 or something like that and see how that works.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.480
Because that would be funny.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.360
There are no lyrics to Max 300.

44:36.360 --> 44:38.640
That's why it's funny.

44:38.640 --> 44:39.640
That's the whole point.

44:39.640 --> 44:42.080
That's the only song that Matt would sing in karaoke anymore.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.520
No, I wouldn't sing it at all.

44:43.520 --> 44:45.160
I'd just be curious to see how it works.

44:45.160 --> 44:49.600
Seriously, like Orange Lounge Radio, if nothing else, this show has accomplished single-handedly

44:49.600 --> 44:54.160
destroying karaoke for Loki, and he'll never sing it again.

44:54.160 --> 44:58.200
Can't really destroy something that wasn't ever really built up in the first place.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.200
I see.

44:59.200 --> 45:02.920
All right, anyhow, check it out if you want.

45:02.920 --> 45:15.900
Well, there is a reward, I should say, or maybe a gift, but there is an Xbox 360 military

45:15.900 --> 45:18.320
appreciation bundle.

45:18.320 --> 45:20.080
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

45:20.080 --> 45:23.040
It's an appreciation bundle.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.040
A what?

45:24.040 --> 45:25.040
Appreciation bundle.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.040
A typo on the damn page.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.040
Oh.

45:27.040 --> 45:28.040
No, it's a typo on the damn box.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.040
Oh.

45:29.040 --> 45:33.360
Oh my god, it is a typo on the box.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.360
Wow.

45:34.360 --> 45:38.080
But you want to know what's even more hilarious about this?

45:38.080 --> 45:39.540
Sorry, go ahead.

45:39.540 --> 45:49.420
First of all, first of all, it's $299.95, and it's the pack that comes with Lego Indiana

45:49.420 --> 45:58.240
Jones and Kung Fu Panda, but they also sold this at Best Buy for the same price.

45:58.240 --> 46:00.400
But they include Blue Dragon now.

46:00.400 --> 46:05.080
No, the one we bought was the same thing.

46:05.080 --> 46:08.680
So they're basically unloading all their excess copies of Blue Dragon that didn't sell?

46:08.680 --> 46:09.680
I don't know.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.720
Well, no, there's no Blue Dragon in this pack.

46:11.720 --> 46:15.420
This is the same one that Best Buy was selling for Christmas.

46:15.420 --> 46:19.040
I'm looking at the dog tag in the corner, and sure enough, military appreciation.

46:19.040 --> 46:23.160
Oh yeah, sorry, Blue Dragon is included with that one, sorry.

46:23.160 --> 46:24.160
It was really tiny.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.160
There you have it.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.720
But still.

46:27.720 --> 46:30.400
But what exactly, where does the money go to?

46:30.400 --> 46:33.140
To appreciate them.

46:33.140 --> 46:38.440
Is it going to a charity, or are they selling this in a particular area of Texas?

46:38.440 --> 46:40.160
They're selling it on the military bases.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.920
Yeah, it was the PX.

46:43.920 --> 46:45.700
So it's a cheap marketing thing and nothing more.

46:45.700 --> 46:49.480
It's no donation to a military society or a veteran's fund.

46:49.480 --> 46:50.480
We want money.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.600
Here, you're bored.

46:52.600 --> 46:53.600
The end.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.600
Interesting.

46:54.600 --> 46:55.600
Yep.

46:55.600 --> 47:01.260
It's not only do you get the Xbox 360 with three games, but you get another free game

47:01.260 --> 47:03.100
that's worth 20 bucks.

47:03.100 --> 47:04.100
If that.

47:04.100 --> 47:09.680
Yes, but you don't pay any taxes on base, military personnel don't, so that's another

47:09.680 --> 47:15.160
added incentive to buy it on base rather than off base, and if that's the cheapest one,

47:15.160 --> 47:16.160
then why not?

47:16.160 --> 47:21.480
I guess that's a good point, because tax can really add up on some of those multi-hundred

47:21.480 --> 47:22.480
dollar purchases.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.480
Good point.

47:24.480 --> 47:32.420
Well, if you want to use your Xbox 360 over wireless internet, there aren't really that

47:32.420 --> 47:34.800
many ways to do it.

47:34.800 --> 47:40.640
Of course, the Microsoft route would be paying $99.99 for their wireless gaming receiver.

47:40.640 --> 47:44.560
However, there are cheaper ways to do it, though.

47:44.560 --> 47:50.840
One new way that's been pointed out by Popular Science is that you can actually download

47:50.840 --> 47:57.240
a freeware program to use an outdated wireless router and use that as a wireless gaming receiver

47:57.240 --> 47:59.000
as well.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.800
And of course, that'll cost you whatever you can find for a cheap router for.

48:03.800 --> 48:11.000
Or as I've been reading as well, you can actually use the original Xbox wireless gaming receiver,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.760
which is under 50 bucks.

48:13.760 --> 48:14.940
Interesting.

48:14.940 --> 48:19.200
Or pretty much any wireless gaming receiver out there that's probably cheaper than $99.99.

48:19.200 --> 48:22.560
Yeah, I paid $99.99 for my little wireless gaming receiver.

48:22.560 --> 48:25.840
It's not an official Xbox one, but it's like a third party one that will also work with

48:25.840 --> 48:29.040
my PS2, which is why I bought it.

48:29.040 --> 48:32.320
But man, that was 100 bucks, just so I can use it.

48:32.320 --> 48:37.080
One reason, one thing I will give props to the PlayStation 3 for, as hard of a time as

48:37.080 --> 48:39.880
I've given that system in the past, I didn't have to set anything up.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.720
Well, yeah, I had to go through a setup, but there was no wireless thing.

48:42.720 --> 48:47.160
It has built-in wireless on it, like they all should.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.160
Mine doesn't.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.160
Really?

48:49.160 --> 48:51.160
It's a 20 gig.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.840
Oh, that's right.

48:52.840 --> 48:53.840
I forgot they didn't all have that.

48:53.840 --> 48:58.600
They also don't have the fancy memory card ports for, you know, pictures.

48:58.600 --> 48:59.600
I don't think mine has that either.

48:59.600 --> 49:00.600
I don't remember.

49:00.600 --> 49:01.600
You don't either.

49:01.600 --> 49:02.600
Yeah.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.600
What do you use them for?

49:03.600 --> 49:04.600
All right, anyhow, sorry.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.920
I just thought I'd bring that up.

49:06.920 --> 49:13.600
Anyhow, you know, a lot of us have those Xbox 360 HD drives, and we're not really using

49:13.600 --> 49:14.600
them anymore.

49:14.600 --> 49:17.120
I don't know about you guys, but I actually unplugged mine, because I have maybe like

49:17.120 --> 49:18.120
seven movies.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.120
I'm broke.

49:19.120 --> 49:20.120
I don't even really watch them.

49:20.120 --> 49:21.120
Yours broke?

49:21.120 --> 49:22.120
Yeah.

49:22.120 --> 49:23.120
Oh my gosh, what happened to it?

49:23.120 --> 49:25.120
It does some...

49:25.120 --> 49:29.480
I wasn't there when it happened, but it's doing some sort of error thing that we can't

49:29.480 --> 49:36.760
watch our movies on there, and a particular certain person that I married hasn't bothered

49:36.760 --> 49:38.520
calling to get it replaced, so.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.680
Well, if you really want a new one, I mean, they're only like 20 bucks at Fry's right

49:42.680 --> 49:43.680
now, I think.

49:43.680 --> 49:46.120
They went so far down in price.

49:46.120 --> 49:47.120
I don't know.

49:47.120 --> 49:51.040
Well, here's the thing, though, is that actually I guess what you can do...

49:51.040 --> 49:58.160
I don't know if this is just the HD DVD player, or if you do this with the actual Xbox 360.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.680
No, it's the HD DVD player.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.680
Okay.

50:01.680 --> 50:06.200
Basically, you break it apart, and you can take the blue diode out of it, and you hook

50:06.200 --> 50:07.200
it up.

50:07.200 --> 50:12.360
They showed it basically hooked up to a laser sight on a gun, but pretty much anything that

50:12.360 --> 50:14.280
has a laser emitting diode.

50:14.280 --> 50:16.640
You can make your own burning laser out of it.

50:16.640 --> 50:17.640
Yes.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.200
Like a shark with a freaking laser beam on its head.

50:19.200 --> 50:20.200
You can actually make your own.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.200
Shark not included.

50:21.200 --> 50:26.480
Yeah, basically, you take the diode out, and you build this really small chip that goes

50:26.480 --> 50:32.480
with it, and you hook that up, and voila, a burning laser that can pop balloons and

50:32.480 --> 50:33.480
burn paper.

50:33.480 --> 50:34.480
Can it melt faces?

50:34.480 --> 50:36.440
If it can't melt faces, it's worthless.

50:36.440 --> 50:40.960
It might hurt if you leave it on someone's face for a while, but I don't know if it can

50:40.960 --> 50:41.960
melt faces.

50:41.960 --> 50:42.960
Ow, ow, that hurts.

50:42.960 --> 50:43.960
Get that dot off my head.

50:43.960 --> 50:44.960
Ow, ow, ow.

50:44.960 --> 50:50.160
Just as a disclaimer, please do not try a LASIK surgery at home by yourself using your

50:50.160 --> 50:52.120
HD DVD drive.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.760
Orange Lounge Radio does not endorse you actually doing this.

50:54.760 --> 50:59.920
It's just kind of cool that you can make a face-melting laser out of your Xbox 360.

50:59.920 --> 51:03.920
And if you don't want to break apart your HD DVD drive because of the single-melting

51:03.920 --> 51:07.920
value or anything like that, you can either buy your own burning laser, or you can buy

51:07.920 --> 51:11.320
a laser diode for 50 bucks.

51:11.320 --> 51:14.840
Shahranden Chat says, laser cats can be a reality.

51:14.840 --> 51:16.800
I would not give this to my cat.

51:16.800 --> 51:19.080
Take it to her head.

51:19.080 --> 51:25.320
I would come home and it would look like a BB gun army ran through my house.

51:25.320 --> 51:29.920
The house would be on fire, for real.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.360
Do not give this to a cat.

51:31.360 --> 51:35.280
If you give this to a cat, you're beyond an idiot.

51:35.280 --> 51:41.880
They're staring at the birds outside and saw, boof.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.060
Ah, yes.

51:44.060 --> 51:45.940
All sorts of awesome.

51:45.940 --> 51:49.320
You come home and the fish tank's boiling.

51:49.320 --> 51:52.800
I don't think that happened, but yeah.

51:52.800 --> 51:53.800
Something to that effect.

51:53.800 --> 51:59.360
The fish would be dead, her food would be toasty, the birds would be on the ground missing

51:59.360 --> 52:00.360
feathers.

52:00.360 --> 52:03.400
Pew, pew, pew, mew, mew, mew.

52:03.400 --> 52:09.500
Sorry, can I look at this video really quick that was posted of somebody actually using

52:09.500 --> 52:10.500
the laser gun?

52:10.500 --> 52:11.500
I'm looking at it here.

52:11.500 --> 52:12.500
I don't know if there's any...

52:12.500 --> 52:13.500
Oh, there's no sound here.

52:13.500 --> 52:14.500
Yeah, he's basically just...

52:14.500 --> 52:19.060
James Bond's weapon of choice, the Walter PPK.

52:19.060 --> 52:24.480
We're not going to use the real gun, but a high performance semi-automatic CO2 version.

52:24.480 --> 52:29.800
To make it burn, we need an Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.

52:29.800 --> 52:30.800
Let's take a...

52:30.800 --> 52:33.000
Yeah, I don't know where this video comes from, but I see a little logo for a break

52:33.000 --> 52:34.920
in the corner, so we'll just leave it at that.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.040
Is there like an embed thing?

52:37.040 --> 52:41.640
I don't know what hell the site this is, so whatever, we'll just play the rest of it.

52:41.640 --> 52:47.160
The side panel snaps off and reveals some hidden screws, so you'll get to work and remove

52:47.160 --> 52:48.160
all of them.

52:48.160 --> 52:51.800
After popping off the cover, it's time to get rid of some more screws until the DVD

52:51.800 --> 52:52.800
drive is screwed up.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
Okay, I want to see them burn stuff.

52:53.800 --> 52:55.360
I don't care about the whole process.

52:55.360 --> 52:56.360
We're boring.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.280
Now the laser assembly gets attached to the Walter.

52:59.280 --> 53:07.000
The new 007 laser weapon easily burns through electrical tape, pops a balloon, and also

53:07.000 --> 53:08.760
lights matches.

53:08.760 --> 53:12.120
The world's first 007 laser weapon, Burning Blue.

53:12.120 --> 53:16.360
Oh my god, if I were still smoking cigarettes, which I don't encourage anyone to do because

53:16.360 --> 53:19.880
it's very addicting and I quit, but if I were still smoking cigarettes, what an awesome

53:19.880 --> 53:21.720
way to light my cigarette.

53:21.720 --> 53:25.920
Hold on guys, I gotta get my gun to light my cigarette.

53:25.920 --> 53:29.400
Actually they had lighters that looked like little guns, but they just had fire instead

53:29.400 --> 53:31.400
of lasers.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.120
Anyhow.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.640
Oh wow.

53:36.640 --> 53:39.160
Sorry, just had a dream.

53:39.160 --> 53:44.280
I was a super spy for a minute with all these kinds of cool gadgets.

53:44.280 --> 53:47.360
But yeah, I won't be getting one of these anytime soon because I'm sure there's laws

53:47.360 --> 53:48.360
against it.

53:48.360 --> 53:53.100
However, there are some cool new games I could be getting pretty soon, but I'd have to travel

53:53.100 --> 53:57.820
to Europe to get some of these games, right DarkSakura?

53:57.820 --> 53:59.480
Actually no, nothing.

53:59.480 --> 54:00.480
Nothing?

54:00.480 --> 54:01.480
There's nothing I can buy?

54:01.480 --> 54:03.040
Nothing on the list.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.040
Well then I guess I get my laser.

54:04.040 --> 54:05.040
Not until the 16th.

54:05.040 --> 54:06.040
I guess I get my laser.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.200
Do we have any releases in the US?

54:08.200 --> 54:12.000
Yes, there are some crappy releases coming through the US.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.080
The first being Paws and Claws Pampered Pets for the Nintendo DS.

54:16.080 --> 54:22.240
Man, that's an ugly looking picture there with chihuahuas and ugly cats.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.680
They're all ugly characters.

54:23.680 --> 54:28.360
Paws and Claws Pet Resort, the same game but now on the Wii.

54:28.360 --> 54:33.400
Bigfoot Collision Course on the Nintendo DS, no pets involved with that one.

54:33.400 --> 54:39.760
Elibits, The Adventures of Kai and Zero on the DS, the sequel to the cool 3D game and

54:39.760 --> 54:42.520
now this is more like Pokemon.

54:42.520 --> 54:46.680
Moon is coming out from Mastiff on the Nintendo DS.

54:46.680 --> 54:50.360
Fishy Master World Tour on the Nintendo Wii.

54:50.360 --> 54:55.840
Jumble Madness, another fun puzzle game on the DS.

54:55.840 --> 54:58.560
And let's see here.

54:58.560 --> 55:02.400
Neighborhood Games on Nintendo Wii.

55:02.400 --> 55:07.760
Personal Trainer Math from Nintendo, because Nintendo thinks you don't know math.

55:07.760 --> 55:11.360
Can I interrupt these shitty games with a funny chat room comment?

55:11.360 --> 55:12.360
Sure.

55:12.360 --> 55:15.720
I mean as much as I'm sure our listening audience cares about all these fucking math games,

55:15.720 --> 55:20.480
this is just too funny because you know we're a little bit delayed so sometimes our comments

55:20.480 --> 55:23.680
on the previous story take a little while to run through chat so a comment on the whole

55:23.680 --> 55:24.760
laser thing.

55:24.760 --> 55:28.880
Shahran in chat says, imagine holding up a convenience store with that.

55:28.880 --> 55:35.000
Give me the money or I'll fucking laser your face.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.440
Horse Launch Radio does not condone these actions.

55:38.440 --> 55:42.000
You could brand somebody with a laser.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.640
Okay sorry Loki, continue telling us about the edutainment titles aplenty coming out

55:45.640 --> 55:46.640
this week.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.640
No that's actually it.

55:47.640 --> 55:48.640
Oh okay, good.

55:48.640 --> 55:52.360
Alright then let's talk about- What, no Jazz Jackrabbit?

55:52.360 --> 55:53.360
Alright.

55:53.360 --> 55:57.700
Let's talk about Japan and what you can look forward to over there.

55:57.700 --> 56:01.200
And actually it's a lot of price release, or price reductions, at least on the Xbox

56:01.200 --> 56:02.200
360.

56:02.200 --> 56:06.360
Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom, and Trusty Bell, which is our eternal sonata, they are

56:06.360 --> 56:10.320
both getting price reductions this week over in Japan, so enjoy those.

56:10.320 --> 56:15.320
PlayStation 3, nada coming out this week, you gotta wait till the 15th for anything

56:15.320 --> 56:17.400
coming out over there.

56:17.400 --> 56:22.440
Fallout 3 makes its debut on the 15th, you have that to look forward to.

56:22.440 --> 56:28.720
On the PlayStation 2, nothing, on the DS, nothing till the 15th, and it's probably the

56:28.720 --> 56:30.400
same story on the PSP as well.

56:30.400 --> 56:34.960
So that's really it, unless you want some price reductions, there is a Mobile Suit Gundam

56:34.960 --> 56:41.520
game on the PSP, Giron no Yabu, Axis no Kaiyui gets a price reduction, that's it.

56:41.520 --> 56:47.120
So it's the week of sales in Japan, otherwise no new stuff till the 15th.

56:47.120 --> 56:50.080
Well then how about just a little something else?

56:50.080 --> 56:51.480
How about it?

56:51.480 --> 56:52.640
Um, stuff.

56:52.640 --> 56:53.840
And nonsense.

56:53.840 --> 56:57.840
And download content!

56:57.840 --> 56:58.840
Horse armor?

56:58.840 --> 57:01.320
What the hell?

57:01.320 --> 57:03.200
You know, like Oblivion had the horse armor?

57:03.200 --> 57:06.200
Ah, forget it.

57:06.200 --> 57:07.200
Forget it.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.200
Anyway.

57:08.200 --> 57:16.480
Um, for the fans of Guitar Hero World Tour, there is a downloadable content, um, dated,

57:16.480 --> 57:22.760
it actually will be coming out, um, January 2009, at some point eventually.

57:22.760 --> 57:25.420
So let's go ahead and go by the date.

57:25.420 --> 57:34.220
So there will be, um, actually this should already, um, be out as Use Me by Hinder, Because

57:34.220 --> 57:42.760
of You by Nickelback, and Light It Up by Revtheory, um, on the 8th, there is, um, a, uh, Country

57:42.760 --> 57:48.080
Rock Track Pack, which is Me and My Gang by Rascal Flats, Tix by Brad Paisley, and Hillbilly

57:48.080 --> 57:50.280
Deluxe by Brooks and Dunn.

57:50.280 --> 57:58.360
Um, there's also, um, on January 15th, there will be Three Songs by Travis Barker.

57:58.360 --> 58:05.840
Um, the 22nd of January, there will be, um, Tomorrow by Silverchair, Dimension by Wolf

58:05.840 --> 58:09.040
Mother, and Out of the Way by The Vines.

58:09.040 --> 58:17.400
And then on the 29th, we have, um, uh, Oasis, um, with the full, uh, Dig Out Your Soul album,

58:17.400 --> 58:20.500
and, um, yeah.

58:20.500 --> 58:29.400
The album is going to be, um, 1,520 Microsoft Points, um, or, um, $18.99 from the PlayStation

58:29.400 --> 58:30.400
Store.

58:30.400 --> 58:34.160
I was gonna ask if that was the first full album for Guitar Hero, but I guess it's not,

58:34.160 --> 58:37.360
because they had the Metallica one, Death Magnetic came out, the full album, when the

58:37.360 --> 58:38.360
CD came out, right?

58:38.360 --> 58:40.920
Yeah, it's not the first album that they've had, they've had a few.

58:40.920 --> 58:41.920
Oh, okay.

58:41.920 --> 58:42.920
Hmm.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.120
And Metallica's infinitely more awesome than Oasis.

58:45.120 --> 58:48.520
Uh, yeah, I'd say so.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.520
So.

58:49.520 --> 58:50.520
Interesting.

58:50.520 --> 58:56.720
Um, some other cool stuff that's coming out on the other music game platform, Rock Band.

58:56.720 --> 59:04.760
Um, the January lineup has been leaked out, as they seem to always happen, um, to do.

59:04.760 --> 59:09.400
Of course, we already knew that Roy Orbison was getting a download pack, um, they're gonna

59:09.400 --> 59:11.080
be six tracks available there.

59:11.080 --> 59:17.600
Claudette in Dreams, Mean Woman Blues, Oh Pretty Woman, Ooby Dooby, and You Got It.

59:17.600 --> 59:25.600
Um, then also, um, there will be a Lenny Kravitz pack, with, uh, Are You Going My Way, Freedom

59:25.600 --> 59:31.880
Train, Let Love Rule, and Mr. Cab Driver, and then finally two tracks from the Steve

59:31.880 --> 59:35.640
Miller band The Joker and Space Cowboy.

59:35.640 --> 59:39.120
See I think there's like one track in each of those packs you mentioned that I would

59:39.120 --> 59:40.120
want to get.

59:40.120 --> 59:44.440
Like, I don't think I can possibly be a guitar playing gamer and not want to get Lenny Kravitz

59:44.440 --> 59:47.980
Are You Gonna Go My Way, because that song is all kinds of awesome, um, even though I

59:47.980 --> 59:50.800
know it's in Guitar Hero World Tour but I still don't own that, I should get that at

59:50.800 --> 59:51.800
some point.

59:51.800 --> 59:56.080
Um, but I also want Pretty Woman and I want, um, The Joker.

59:56.080 --> 59:57.080
So that's pretty awesome.

59:57.080 --> 59:58.080
Yeah.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.640
You said I don't really want the packs, I just want the one song from each pack.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.920
Forget it.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.480
Anyhow, let's talk about someone who's stupid, but we actually can't give this person a stupid

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.560
award because there's someone even dumber we're going to talk about later in the show,

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.760
so just imagine what it's going to take to top this, but, uh, just more of an FYI to

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.880
all of you people out there in the world, please do not actually take your credit card

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.960
and, uh, put it in a Wii.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.800
Now keep this in mind, because the first thing I thought when I heard this, I'm like, bullshit,

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:31.360
somebody's doing this as a joke, this is coming from a forum, so, uh, you know, take it with

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.840
a grain of salt, okay?

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:40.080
Um, however, apparently somebody posted on this forum, um, their neighbors actually got

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.840
a Wii for Christmas, there was no games, but they got a classic controller and a nunchuck

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:51.040
combo and a case and all that stuff, and, uh, so they were asking the kid for recommendations,

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.200
they recommended Animal Crossing City Folk, Wario Land Shake It, Mario Kart Wii, and Super

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.920
Mario Galaxy, those are all good recommendations, I think, uh, and then said to go on and get

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.640
some virtual console games like Super Mario World and Sonic 2, uh, so the mom said, asked

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.280
what virtual console is and da da da, and the kid said, all you have to do is put in

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.400
your credit card when you're prompted to on the shop channel.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.000
So what does she do?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.400
She actually tried to put three credit cards into the disc slot.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.000
What a fucking moron.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.800
That's why I'm like, nobody can really be this stupid.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.800
Can they?

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.800
Really?

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800
Really?

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.160
Can you go back to like those horror stories from tech support where somebody called, you

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:36.280
know, like saying that they accidentally snapped off the, uh, uh, cup holder on their computer,

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.880
which was actually the CD-ROM drive?

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.880
You've lived it, Drew.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.120
Drew, can you, is this possible?

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.360
Do you think this level of stupidity is actually possible, Drew?

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.400
It is both possible and rampant.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.640
Why?

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.640
Why do people actually think that?

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:56.300
I mean, doesn't the screen make it pretty clear that you put in your credit card number?

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.920
There are people out there who do not touch half the buttons on their TV remotes because

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:06.240
they think we'll make the TV explode.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240
I am teaching.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.320
Maybe they need those buttons.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.040
I do not push else explosion.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:16.480
I am teaching certain family members to use the digital cable guide as we speak.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.040
Hey, wait, wait a minute though.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.600
I will say Comcast system is pretty screwy that that does take a class or two to learn

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600
how to use.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.760
You need a college degree to be able to navigate that.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.240
It's not TiVo, Drew.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.520
I've never used TiVo.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.040
It's happy face and frown face.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.880
No, thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to rate things.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.080
I mean, a four year old could figure it out, I hope.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.120
But Comcast?

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.120
Kind of crappy.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:51.600
Kazaam in chat, or Kazaam in chat, the name I can't pronounce tonight, says, once my friend

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.400
was at work, this woman came in and was buying a Playstation 3 game, and she was asking him

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.160
will it work on her VCR.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:05.680
Well, ma'am, do you have a beta?

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.680
So I don't know.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:11.920
Apparently this is what it looks like if you actually put your credit card in the Wii is

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.580
that then suddenly your system will have a lot of lines going through it and it's unable

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:21.360
to read a disk because there's no actual disk in the system, just a jammed credit card.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.360
Congrats.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.360
God.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.480
I don't know.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.960
I kind of call bullshit, but it's a funny story nonetheless.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:33.040
You know somewhere someone's tried to do it, but what's happened here is that somebody's

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.320
actually recorded it.

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:42.000
Anyhow, let's talk about something a lot more relevant and something the smart people do.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.320
And what smart people do is that they go and they try to explore their gaming's history

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.560
and play some obscure video games they may not have before.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.880
And Dark Sakura, well, heck, she's one of the smartest and she's here to pick.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880
She's the most smartest, in fact.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.720
And she's here to pick a video game for you to play this week in a segment we call The

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.320
Classic Game of the Week.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.900
So what should the kids play this week?

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:09.480
The Classic Game of the Week was suggested to me by Sauce.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480
I see.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:15.280
So this is a saucy way to kick in 2009.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.800
Captain America and the Avengers.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.760
Yay.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.680
This game is classic.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:32.680
Side scrolling, beat em up action with cheese ball voice acting and wonderful background

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680
music.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.600
Let's just have some of this background music.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.400
Can we, Rob?

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.600
Well, maybe after the story part.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:05:01.840
Anyway, you get to play as one of four of the Avengers, either Captain America, Iron

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:08.760
Man, Hawkeye, or Vision, which why Vision is all white and not green and red, like Christmas

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760
is beyond me.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.840
It could just be graphical limitations at the time.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:19.000
But you could actually either play a four player cabinet or a two player cabinet.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.960
You just have to change it on the board itself.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960
That's pretty cool.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.560
And you get sound effects, like in old comic books.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.360
You get black, wham.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360
Or 60s Batman.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Yeah, or 60s Batman.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360
I grew up on this frickin' game.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:39.920
I remember playing it at Pizza Hut when I was six.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920
No, it's great.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:46.320
It's the reason I went out to eat Pizza Hut, because the pizza certainly sucked.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.720
I went there to play Captain America in the frickin' event.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.040
Oh no, don't go to Pizza Hut and expect to get pizza.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:54.040
Oh no.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:06:03.360
Anyway, you actually fight different, you know, your bosses, which will be Klaw, the

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:12.000
Living Laser, Whirlwind, the Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin, Juggernaut, Ultron,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.440
Crossbones, and the Red Skull.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:22.480
You also get cameos by other Avengers, which, was Namor ever an Avenger, because it says

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.480
he's in the game.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.800
I don't think he ever really was one.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.560
He was by hanging around sometimes, and shouting imperious ones.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:39.440
Anyway, but you had Wasp, Quicksilver, and Wonder Man.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.160
Is Samuel L. Jackson in it?

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.800
No, this was before.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.400
This was before Ultimates.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.840
I see.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:57.160
This was David Hasselhoff era.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:02.120
Unfortunately, while the arcade version was great, the console ports really sucked.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.960
That's what I was getting to.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:13.200
The game was put out by Data East, and they released the Genesis version, and after that

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.400
it was licensed to Mindscape, so there was a port to the Super Nintendo, the Game Boy,

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.360
and the Game Gear.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.600
There was also an NES version, where you could only play as Captain America and Hawkeye,

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.720
and you had to save Vision and Iron Man from the Mandarin.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.160
Which was kind of like playing Bionic, and it was actually supported, had this map set

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160
up like Bionic Commando.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.160
Yeah, it was a platformer.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160
Yeah.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160
It kind of sucked, too.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:45.880
Oh yeah, because Mandarin would so be able to do that.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.880
Well it-

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.880
As if.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880
Shock.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:54.760
At any rate, another bit of fun trivia is that the North American version of the arcade

01:07:54.760 --> 01:08:00.520
machine, when your character dies, instead of saying continue, or like, America still

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.440
needs your help.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.880
That's the part I remember about this game.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.600
Even I played this game when I was younger.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.600
I wasn't six.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.960
I was a little bit older, but a little bit.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.280
But I do remember that when you would die, America still needs your help.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.280
Yeah.

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.640
It's a really lame- I can't move!

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.680
It really tries to guilt you when they continue playing.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.320
Like if you don't put in another quarter, you are a terrorist.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320
Basically.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:32.640
Well, clearly that line was removed from the Asian-European versions.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:36.560
Dear Data East, make more pinball.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.120
Where's our Avengers pinball?

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.680
The end.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.960
Alright, so there it is, your classic video game of the week.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.680
Captain America and the Avengers.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.880
Please note- Sounds like a bad band.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:56.320
Specifically though, here are the arcade versions, not the console versions, which are a little

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.320
bit shit.

01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.880
A little bit.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880
There you have it.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880
Your classic video game of the week.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.280
So that's going to be a hard one for the kids to find, because you know, we would never

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.840
endorse downloading ROMs and playing them on emulators.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:07.840
Oh no no.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.720
No, we've never used MAME in our lives.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.160
So you're going to need to find a Pizza Hut near you that still has this game.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.520
So good luck with that.

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.080
Let us know what you find.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.760
Alright, so that's going to do it for this part A of our show, but hey, we still have

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:26.080
plenty more, including, including hello tonight, we are going to play Match Game.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.720
That's right, tonight we're going to play Match Game and give away some prize.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.200
Are we going to tell them what the prize is that we're giving away tonight, or are we

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.480
keeping it a secret, or what are we doing?

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.520
We will tell you right after the break.

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.280
Oh ho ho, good tease, alright.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.720
So we'll tell you right after the break, so stay tuned.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.760
See the podcast listeners though, they're not going to have to wait at all, except then

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.120
again they don't get to play either, because the game will be done by the time this is

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.120
the podcast feed.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120
Sorry guys.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.800
I promise there will be a contest you can do very soon.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:10:01.320
Anyhow, let's take a break, we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.080
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080
4th of 2009.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.520
I'm very happy because I'm eating ice cream, Dark Soccer and Tiara Rara, or Sauce, brought

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.120
ice cream tonight for us, and it's like the slow churn kind, so it's actually not that

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.360
bad as far as fat goes either, so that made me very happy.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.160
Thank you both for thinking of that.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.160
Good.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.920
Now do we get to talk about our fabulous prizes tonight.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.760
The chat room, you see the podcast listeners just mere seconds had to wait, but the folks

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.000
in chat, they've had to wait like 20 minutes, because we had such a long break tonight because

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.440
of ice cream, to figure out what they're playing for tonight, so yeah.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.120
And Dark Knight in chat says, I hope you guys get brain freezes, but what is the fabulous

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.120
prize you're going to play for tonight?

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.880
Well tonight I have brought the prize, it is a $25 Amazon gift certificate.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.000
Wow, that's like a DS game right there, alright, very nice.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.120
So is this courtesy of AvengersTower.com?

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.160
Sure, why not.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:03.600
I figured you guys have given Xbox related stuff out as prizes before, and some people

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.560
don't have Xboxes, or some people would rather spend it on other things, so Amazon gift certificate

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.560
kind of is whatever you want, you can spend it game related, or else whatever you want

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.560
to spend it on.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.840
Alright, and our chat room is subsequently freaking out tonight, they're like, oh my

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:24.040
gosh, it's $25 tonight, so the stakes are high tonight in match games, so we'll have

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.840
a qualifying question later on, and then it will be the first person to get through on

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.360
Skype when I say, not yet, when I say, if you call now you're going to piss me off,

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.960
I'm not going to answer your call later, but when I say, we'll get to that a little later

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.160
in the show, and it's match game tonight, and not only is it match game, it's epic match

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.600
game, because there's five questions instead of the usual three, because we do have a big

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:52.240
prize on the line tonight, so yeah, $25, there you go, and yeah, so sorry, those of us here

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:56.640
in the studio can't win, I know as much as you want to win, you got to give it to a listener.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:04.800
Alright, Kazam and Chat says, that's like two euro, sad but true, sad but true.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.920
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news before we get to the fancy prizes, big

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.440
money, big prizes, Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:19.240
Alright, sweet, well, there's, I think we talked about this last week, there was some

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:26.480
new Sega games, or I should say older Sega games, that were getting new ESRB listings,

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:32.600
and one of those actually, that wasn't quite part of one of the ESRB listings, but it's

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:38.280
been re-registered by Sega for another trademark, would be Choo Choo Rocket.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:46.480
Apparently on December 22nd, Sega USA has a re-registered Choo Choo trademark as one

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:53.020
of many Dreamcast titles to get, I guess, remade.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:58.160
Some other trademarks that have been re-registered as well, Sonic Shuffle, Cosmic Smash, Jet

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:05.280
Grind Radio, Virtual On, and now Choo Choo Rocket.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.600
That's interesting, I wonder what that means, it might actually be possibly coming out on

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.040
Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare, as people seem to think.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.760
Awesome, I guess if you're a huge fan of Choo Choo Rocket, I don't know, I was never that

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.720
big on Choo Choo Rocket, but I'm hoping this means, I'm hoping that maybe some other big

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.920
games will come out, thanks to this, so we'll see.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.080
Alright, sorry I'm laughing, because if I sound like I'm laughing, it's because I am,

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:36.480
because I really shouldn't do this, but I send private messages during the show, and

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.020
whatever, I know Jamie does it too, so we're all chatting and whatever during the show,

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.160
so sometimes I send funny things, so that's why I'm laughing.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.480
Loki, do you talk to anyone else while the show's going on?

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.480
No.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.480
Oh.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.480
Loser.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.480
I was talking to Drew, but now I'm done.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.480
You were talking to Drew?

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.200
Yeah, I was IMing him with my phone, but now I signed out, because it's too hard to text

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.600
IM.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.160
You guys are sitting literally mere feet away from each other, you could write on a paper.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:09.400
We did this the other night, because I sent something to her on Twitter, and then I was

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.400
like, wait, she was right behind me.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.040
Or, and I guess I'll say this now, I was going to kind of leave it a secret until we come

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:21.240
back from vacation and I actually have it hung up, however, the studio got a new present

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:30.040
this week, thanks to Rama, sent us right over here, this whiteboard, and you might remember

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:37.020
why we, I love this, we say something random on air and suddenly it shows up in my mail,

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:42.400
we had talked about in the garage, hanging up in the big blank spot we have, a whiteboard

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.760
to keep our issues that we have with, I think it was GameStop at the time, but I'm thinking

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.760
maybe just our issues we have with various gaming companies we can actually write up

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.920
there on the board, so we will actually have a whiteboard come the return of, come the

01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:12.560
return of, and I believe we'll also have a camera, finally, again next week, to actually

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.560
show the board with, so, we'll talk more about all the stuff, we'll see, we'll see, anyhow,

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.400
hey, Q Games, talking on the Playstation blog this week about some games that are coming

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:23.320
out in 2009, they are pixel junk titles, two or three of them, apparently, are coming out

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.560
this year, one of them has already come out, that was Pixel Junk Monsters for the PSP,

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:31.960
however, who knows what the others could be, although, you know, if you believe what you've

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:38.400
seen on Spike TV lately, there was skiing, fighting, and so on, so you can probably imagine

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:42.160
there's going to be a pixel junk about some other type of genre you've probably already

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.740
seen before, but, of course, one of the last games we got from them was Pixel Junk Eden,

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:52.600
which was kind of like random, so who knows what it's going to be, I do not play this

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.400
series an awful lot, but I know it's one of the few exclusive series they've got going

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.840
on right now, right, Logie?

01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840
Which one, though?

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:00.840
Pixel Junk?

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.240
Yes, it is one exclusive series that they have going on.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240
Have you ever played it?

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.680
I have not played these games personally, so I don't know a whole lot about it.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.080
I thought there was another one, like a Pixel Junk Racer game, as well.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.080
I think there is.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.080
Yeah.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.720
I don't know, I haven't really touched any of them, but remember, lately, you know, up

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.640
until about a couple weeks ago, I didn't realize that, you know, I couldn't just spend the

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:26.000
exact amount on the PlayStation Network for things, although I still don't see myself

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.280
playing a lot of stuff on the PlayStation 3, so, uh, I'm a little hesitant to buy stuff

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:37.360
like Pixel Junk games, just because I have so many Xbox Live Arcade games that I don't

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:40.480
play, you know what I mean?

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.480
Yeah, I hear you.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.440
All right, well, just thought I'd check.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.360
All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Jamie?

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:57.360
Well, this is, I guess, a matter of debate for several people.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:05.920
They're saying that collectible games are losing their value because of digital re-releases,

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:12.600
especially if, you know, go look on Amazon, not on Amazon, but on eBay, for a lot of these

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:17.800
titles, people are just not getting the money that they used to be able to get for them.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:26.160
For example, um, uh, Ikaruga, um, was, uh, $75 for the Dreamcast version, $45 for the

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:31.200
GameCube version, um, when they both came out on Xbox Live Arcade, uh, the games went

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:42.640
to $5 to $15, um, really, I honestly, I'm not really, I don't really care that much.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.880
This is good news for me.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.480
You collect a lot of video games, you have some obscure fucking shit in your house, so

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.920
if anybody's gonna be pissed off, I'd imagine you'd be.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.920
Why?

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:57.160
I have these games because I want to play the originals on the original system.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:03.280
If they go down in price, that means I can go buy them a lot easier than I would have

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.400
been able to before, and I can hook up my Turbo Duo and freakin' play these games.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:15.560
Sapphire got re-released in Japan, you know, I could play it on, on PSP if I wanted to,

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:20.000
but I still want to have the Turbo, the, actually I need to have a system that will support

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.040
an arcade card, but I'd really love to play it on Turbo Duo, or on, I should say, PC Engine

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:31.760
Duo, um, it, I don't really care so much about them being re-released, because the whole

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.480
reason, now I was, I was kinda giddy for a little while about my version of, about having

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:42.500
Dracula X, when, ooh, $300, I got it for $100, ooh, and, and then I was like, but, really,

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:47.760
the whole reason I wanted the game was to play it, because it's a fun game, and if it's

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:53.500
being re-released, that means that, you know, more people can actually get a chance to play

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.720
the, the fun shit that I have.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.720
Like Suikoden this week, or Castlevania Chronicles.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.160
Well I don't really give a crap about Suikoden, sorry.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160
Castlevania Chronicles?

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.160
Yeah.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.160
Okay.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.840
But I mean, it's, it's, it's just, it's a game.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.560
Why shouldn't they re-release it, especially if they know people love it?

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.040
Why shouldn't they try to make money off of old franchises, seriously?

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.560
I have no problem with it.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:24.080
Even though, ooh, you're not special anymore, ooh, you know, if you've got the original

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:30.720
game, and you've got the original system, and you can play said game on said system,

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:31.720
that's pretty special.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.360
It's still kinda cool.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.480
It's, it's pretty cool, I think.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:39.280
I mean, you can, you've got the original experience in your hands.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:45.800
You can fit, like, every Atari 2600 cartridge ever made onto one CD, probably, but it's

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.480
still, like, kinda cool when you actually see, like, an Atari 2600 system, and you actually

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.920
see, like, the cartridge for Sword Quest, it's kinda like, oh cool, I remember this

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920
game.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.560
We hook up our nests and blow in the thing all the time, just to, you know, it's the

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560
same thing.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560
It's-

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:06.880
Rob, you could probably fit every single Atari 2600 cartridge onto one PlayStation 2 memory

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.880
card.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880
Probably, I wouldn't doubt it.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.720
Six megs for all the ROMs.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.280
Don't ask me how I know that.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.960
How do you kn- never mind.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.320
Well, at any rate, it's, it's a difference in experience.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:24.600
You can play the game, or you could go back on the system, and that's why I had a big

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:29.680
problem with emulation for a little while, and it wasn't that I had a problem with people

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.240
ripping games and emulating them and this, that, and the other, it's the fact that I

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:38.560
really wanted to have the original game so that I could play it on my system and play

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:43.120
the game the way other people played the game, you know, you know what I mean?

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.120
Right.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:49.640
And, so that's where I think the, the special part of it is, you know, is having it and

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.200
playing it, but seriously, if other people get to enjoy the game, I have no problem with

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.200
it.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.960
If it makes it cheaper for me to get those games that I want, by all means!

01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.960
You know?

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:00.960
Let's release more!

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:06.000
Now tell me, though, how many people have a, uh, Turbo Duo.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Mmm.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
It still works.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You do.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I know.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.600
And I love it.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.600
But you know what?

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.000
If anyone wanted to play my Turbo Duo, I would bring it over.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.840
As long as their house wasn't, you know, covered in dust that went up to my knees.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.320
Very nice.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.720
Your house is not that dusty!

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720
My house?

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720
Is it?

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720
No, Andrew's over there making faces at me.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720
Oh.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:33.720
I don't know.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720
Alright.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.720
My car is very dusty.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.900
It's probably dustier than your house.

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:40.920
My PlayStation 3 is really dusty, except in the area where the eject button and the power

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:41.920
button is.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.920
It's like a dust magnet.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.920
It's very interesting.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.120
If I didn't dust ours, it'd be like that.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.120
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:53.000
You should put, like, that end dust on it or something, or, yeah, that would suck the

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.040
dust to it.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.600
Let me, uh, read some comments from chat here.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:59.040
Footy, I'm sorry, not Footy Monster, Act F says, uh, Collectors, Swap Meets are your

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.040
friends.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.200
I speak for my friends' experience.

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.200
And my own.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.200
I don't know.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.560
Have you had a lot of luck at Swap Meets, Dark Sakura, in your collecting?

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:07.560
Every so often.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.560
Yeah.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.560
Very cool.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.560
Hmm.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:16.320
Well, um, I know when Mega Man 9 came out earlier this year, it was pretty much the

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.640
retro gamer's kind of dream game, um, especially, you know, perfect release for the, uh, Mega

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.400
Man series, kind of going back to the roots of, like, the earlier Mega Man games.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.880
Well, it almost wasn't the case.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:35.720
Um, actually, 1UP did an interview with the producer of Mega Man 9 and said, uh, they

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:43.120
had heard a bunch of, um, they were, management of Capcom was actually talking about doing

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:52.280
a 3D Mega Man game for Mega Man 9 instead, um, which is interesting, and says, um, you

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.920
know, they had heard lots of negative responses.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:59.600
They thought that it would be better to make it 3D and that the 8-bit style will only appeal

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:07.280
to Mega Man fans, which would limit the sales potential, because it's all about money.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.120
And eventually they figured out that 8-bit graphics were also cheap to develop, which

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.600
also made them money, so, yay!

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:19.760
I just, I mean, would it have been the 3D game, like, the Mega Man Legends you've always

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.600
been asking for, or would it have just been, like, just some shitacious arcade game?

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.800
I think it would be, like, the later Mega Man X games, where it's, like, 3D, 2D type

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:33.240
thing, um, which, you know, looking at Bionic Re-Armed, and, you know, Bionic Commander

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:39.320
Re-Armed wouldn't be all that bad, but it's just not, you know, Mega Man 9.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.280
It would really depend, it would just really, really depend.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.920
I still think they should go back and do some new Mega Man Legends games for the Wii.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:51.680
I think it would be perfect, because the Wii can't really churn out anything, you know,

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:58.160
that fantastic, so, it should be able to handle some ports of PlayStation 1 games, and, hell,

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.320
I liked Mega Man Legends, I thought it was awesome.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.280
Do you think there'll be a Mega Man 10?

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280
Someday.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.280
Someday.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.280
I think Mega Man 9 did really well, so, uh...

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:10.600
Or will they just call it Mega Man X and then really confuse us, because, you know, there's

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.000
Mega Man 10 and now Mega Man X, it's just too confusing.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Uh...

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.640
How about Mega Man 9-2?

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.000
What happens when they get to Mega Man X-10?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.120
Uh, too crazy.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120
Mega Man Triple X.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.120
Oh, yeah.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.120
Oh, yeah.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.120
Isn't that already fan-fiction?

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.120
The love robots.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:31.640
You have to kill Cock Man and Boob Woman.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.160
Anyway, um, excuse me.

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.360
I can hear the show going down the toilet.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.720
It must be that time for...

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.720
Stupid Award!

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:47.240
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the stupidest of them all?

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.400
Well, this week, it is a 17-year-old, and so, therefore, we don't know their name, because

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.600
it's some dumb kid, and this 17-year-old lives in Ohio, and what he did this week, he threatened

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.080
to commit suicide on an internet video game.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.400
What game?

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.400
World of Warcraft.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.520
That's right.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:11.480
He paged a GM in World of Warcraft and told the GM that he was suicidal, that the game

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:15.520
is the only thing that he has to live for, and you might think, gee, Rob, that's pretty

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.680
harsh of you to give somebody who's suicidal a stupid award.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.960
Well, uh, here's the whole thing.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.400
It was a joke.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:29.640
The kid did it as a joke, quote, to try and get what he wanted for the game.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.920
So in other words, because he wanted his fat purple loots or whatever, he tried to threaten

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:41.700
suicide to try to get a sympathetic Blizzard employee, I guess, to give him free stuff

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:42.700
in the game.

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:43.700
I would've loved that.

01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:44.700
Just me.

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:47.080
He'd be like, I'm going to kill myself for you.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.080
Give me free stuff.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.080
Yeah.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.080
You go ahead and kill yourself.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.480
I have the questions being asked where in Ohio.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.720
I think that they're like, oh God, is this in my town?

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.320
Uh, it was in Middletown because it's being from the Middletown Journal.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.320
Oh no, it's Fairfield.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320
Wait, wait.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:02.320
Wait.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:03.320
There's a sympathetic Blizzard employee?

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.320
Fairfield Township.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.320
What are you talking about?

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.320
What do you mean?

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.880
There are no sympathetic Blizzard employees.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.760
Actually, the one GM I talked to one time was really nice.

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.520
They said, uh, you know, my character's name is kind of funny.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.560
I don't want to repeat it, but you have a funny character name.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.040
They're like salutations and said my name and they even gave me a less than three, a

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.040
little heart.

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.120
It's a standardized greeting.

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.960
Oh, whatever.

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.960
You're a standardized greeting.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.360
I talk to a lot of them.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.600
Why are you like a, are you like a tattletale or something?

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.360
I'm a role player.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.360
Oh God.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.360
Oh God.

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:43.840
People love to fuck with me when I'm role playing with other people.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840
I see.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.840
All right.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.360
Well anyway, uh, by the way, just so you guys know, the kid was handcuffed and placed in

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:50.360
a patrol car.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.400
Uh, the boy was, which Jamie is applauding.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.680
The boy was then released to his father a little later, hopefully for some big spankings,

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.920
even though he's 17.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.600
Somehow I don't think that would stop Jamie if it was her kid.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:06.600
No.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:11.560
If you were, if you were 17, if your 17 year old did this, would you spank them?

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560
Yes.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.280
Uh, by the way, the kid is going to appear in court on Tuesday, Tuesday, the sixth Butler

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.640
County juvenile court.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.920
Wow.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:22.920
It does.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.040
It tells you practically where this kid lives in the story.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.040
That's not good.

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.480
You can probably figure out who it is.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.560
I'm not going to say it.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.840
That's too much, but it's Billy.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.480
Wow.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.040
It's a first degree misdemeanor, by the way, for, uh, that whole thing.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.780
But you know, as a Blizzard employee, they do, I mean, props to them for taking all the

01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:41.780
claims seriously.

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:46.720
Cause you know, you never know, you know, if you've ever dealt with suicidal people,

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.160
suicidal people, they just want to talk to anyone that will listen.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.520
And I could totally see that I bet Blizzard gets some of these that are legit and like

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.480
really sad and all that.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:57.440
So it kind of sucks that there's this one asshole kid who has to take the whole thing

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.440
as a joke.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.000
And it's also in their best interest to keep their clients alive so that they can pay their

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000
money.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Besides just that low key.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.600
I just want to say businesses like that or companies like that do take things like that

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.600
seriously.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.560
Cause it's bad PR if they die in them.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:20.280
Well, yeah, but a friend of mine actually, um, her, uh, friend's crazy boyfriend started

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:25.240
texting her about how he was going to commit suicide and all this stuff.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:30.520
And uh, he was just crazy and they, uh, you know, he denied everything cause she called

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.120
the police cause she was worried about him.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:37.080
She had all the text messages, they had phone records, you know, from all the calls and

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:40.600
everything and he got dragged off to the funny farm and that could have happened to that

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:41.600
kid.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:44.900
You know, they could have said, well, if he's going to commit suicide, let's call the police

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.000
and have them take him to a mental institution for an evaluation.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.680
And I'm not sure if that's better or worse than jail, but long story short, don't be

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:55.480
stupid and do things like that.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.480
That's right.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.020
You ever, you know, a 17 year old should have had the boy who cried wolf read to him when

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.480
he was, you know, five or younger.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.560
Anyhow, there you go.

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:11.600
That sounds like a quest that should be in world of Warcraft cause they like parodying,

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.360
you know, all the fairytales.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360
I don't know.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.780
They do like to parody a lot of stuff.

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:20.280
They have a parody of PETA in the game, which I thought was really funny.

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.200
Like if you get the blood of animals on you and then you try to run through this little

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.760
encampment, like they'll all try to kill you and call you names.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.400
So it's kind of funny anyhow.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.260
I would think that they would want to throw blood on you, you know.

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.080
That's not how it works.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:39.540
Anyhow, let's get to the part of the show where you guys get to interact with us.

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.760
Not the skype line, but the other part.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.760
The mailbag!

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.520
Every week you guys send us emails.

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.120
Mailbag at orangelaundrytrader.com and we like to read them here on the air.

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:52.560
So that's what we're going to do right now is allow you guys to get your emails read

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.560
on the show.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.560
DarkSakura.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.560
Well, we've only got three emails.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:03.480
So the first one is from Cheeseburger.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:06.520
Hi, O.L.R.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:09.560
About a year ago while I was doing my math homework, I was listening to your wonderful

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:14.840
show when my math book pushed the PSP off the table and broke the screen.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:20.120
I called Sony and even when it was still under extended warranty, they wanted $90 to fix

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.120
it.

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.120
Well, I thought, screw that, Sony.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.680
And my PSP gathered dust for over a year.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.760
Then I discovered the magic of eBay and got a new screen.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.400
It's like buying a new PSP all over again.

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:36.240
So my question to you guys, and girls, is what games or UMD movies do you recommend?

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:42.600
I don't like sports games, but I do like RPGs, MMOs, FPSs, anything else that uses an acronym.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.640
I'm sorry.

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.640
That was me.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.000
Anything you guys like, pretty much.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.560
I also have a few movies in one game, Medal of Honor Heroes.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.600
Oh, and it's a PSP fap.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:57.520
Also my DS has been gathering dust for longer than that, and it's working fine.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:05.520
Any games we're checking out on that, yeah, for PSP.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:11.120
Get Final Fantasy I and II for sure, if you like RPGs, those are pretty awesome remakes.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:18.880
There's also the Metal Gear games that came out on that, the interesting little card games

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.880
that they were.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.560
Patapon's kind of fun if you like little music games like that.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.800
Ever extend extra?

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.120
Yeah, the Q games are fun.

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.400
I found your copy again.

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.320
Thank God, bring it back.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:36.280
And I like Space Invaders Extreme was fun too, but I like those music-y type games.

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:39.760
As far as UMDs, if you can freaking find any, good luck.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.880
Whatever movies you like, dude, don't let me tell you what movies you like.

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.540
Yeah, they're kind of hard to find, so good luck with that.

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:55.000
As far as DS goes, definitely in Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, Cooking Mama 2, Dracula

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.560
X Chronicles, that's for PSP.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:01.600
Final Fantasy IV, if I'm going to be a Final Fantasy horror, why not?

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.820
Chrono Trigger is coming out, is out, on DS.

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:09.080
So you definitely, Animal Crossing, there's that.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.280
Chatroom's recommending DJ Max if you're a music fan for PSP.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:18.640
So there you go, just look online.

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.200
Good times.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.200
Next email?

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.200
Yes.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.760
Is, uh, Dear OLR, first of all, Happy New Year.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:29.640
Here's to the year not resembling the intake valve of a commercial air compressor.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:34.000
By that I mean I hope it does not suck nor seem designed to do just that.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.360
Second, to all the Doctor Who fans in the OLR me, here's an article of interest.

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:43.400
New Doctor is the youngest ever, and yes, I have seen this.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:48.240
The new Doctor is Tom Green.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.240
Tom Green is the new Doctor.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.160
Dear God, hell no.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:33:01.040
Matt Smith is an actor I'm not too familiar with, but he is the youngest to ever play

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.240
the Doctor.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.600
The second youngest was Peter Davison, who is the fifth Doctor.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:15.440
And they've, if I'm right, they've actually already started filming for the 2009 series.

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.640
But oh well, I don't know too much about him.

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:23.460
If any of our listeners overseas know more about this guy, send me some of his stuff

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:28.840
so I can see what it is.

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.840
But yeah.

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:33.120
It says, thank you for your time, Hunter Red, Redertainment.

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.160
This message is brought to you by Zap Attack, insert cheap plug here.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.880
There is some Doctor 11 hate going on in chat.

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:44.840
Brad from Pod Culture says the casting for Doctor 11 sucks.

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.560
I am saying this.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:54.660
As much of a 10 fan girl I am, I think I'm going to give the guy a chance.

01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:01.040
The only Doctor who was ever an awful Doctor was the sixth Doctor.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:03.440
He was scary.

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:09.200
So to me, my favorite Doctor to date is still the fourth Doctor, you know, as much as I

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.200
love 10.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:15.040
But I also sort of see that dividing line between series.

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.900
We won't even talk about the movie.

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:20.680
So in other words, we need to give the guy a chance?

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680
Give him a chance.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.680
Just give him one episode?

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.680
No.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:24.680
To make it good?

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.680
Give him the season.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.680
All right.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.680
Give the guy a chance.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.120
You don't know until you see them in.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:38.320
All we are saying, give Matt Smith a chance.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:45.280
Well, it's just my point is, is you really aren't going to know until you watch it with

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.280
an open mind.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:51.080
If you watch it expecting him to suck, if you watch it looking for all the faults, you're

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.080
going to see them.

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:57.080
You're not going to enjoy yourself because you're going to be too busy sucking your.

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.380
He's not David Tennant.

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:00.380
And I wind.

01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:01.380
I did wine.

01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:03.480
My first day I wind.

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:08.280
But my opinion is sit back and watch.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:13.280
You have to watch anyways, because at some point soon Patrick Stewart will be guest starring.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.560
So that's that's definitely worthwhile.

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:22.180
I think that's probably during one of the special the filler specials next year or this

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.180
year rather.

01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:26.360
I'm still stuck in last year, but that's still worth watching.

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.840
And I mean, just give it a chance.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:32.040
I had actually never watched Doctor Who until recently.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:36.800
And so I guess I'm not as affected by, oh, my God, they're changing him so.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.240
You can get it in the Netflix instance download on 360.

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.480
I found out pretty cool.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.360
I do have some on there, but I have the all eight seasons of Red Dwarf to go through first.

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:46.360
So.

01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:49.280
Drew Nami is suggesting Loki is the 13th doctor.

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.280
You know, I don't think that will work because he's not.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.060
I'm not a Doctor Who fan.

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.560
He's not very British.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:36:00.240
But from what I'm understanding, the episode with Patrick Stewart on is actually going

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.440
to be an actual episode, but it's during David Tennant's run still.

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.760
They should just do Simon Pegg as the next doctor.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.000
Simon Pegg has already been in an episode of Doctor Who.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But not as the doctor.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.960
No, but he's been in an episode in there.

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:22.080
I would love Simon Pegg as the doctor, but they are very.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:26.360
They're very continuity conscious.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:31.040
I like the idea of Doctor Who being a woman or it was Catherine Zeta-Jones.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.040
Come on.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.040
I mean, she sold T-Mobile.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.040
She could sell a TARDIS.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.040
You know what?

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.040
I wish, and sorry, spoilers.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.400
Who cares if Donna took over as the doctor?

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:44.000
John Cleese is the next doctor.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.440
You know, now I, now I need to.

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.440
That would be awesome.

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.960
I need to see Doctor Who and the Curse of the Fatal Death, which is Rowan Atkinson playing

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:54.960
the doctor.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.500
No, I need to.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.360
You know who they should cast as the doctor?

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.360
Benny Hill.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.360
Isn't he dead?

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.360
Exhum him.

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.360
Is Benny Hill dead?

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:03.360
Probably.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:10.360
Bono is the next Doctor Who.

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:15.640
Now you've got me all curious if Benny Hill is dead or not.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640
All right.

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:17.640
He is.

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.640
All right.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.000
Let's take our word for it.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
All right.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Well, I don't know.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.720
Make it like a Weekend at Bernie's thing.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.280
All right.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.280
Let's move on.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.240
This show is getting depressing.

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.240
So moving on to the last email.

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:33.800
Christ, he died in 1992.

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:39.280
Where did Horace Hahn's radio bring you the late-breaking news?

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.240
Benny Hill just died.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.240
Today is a tragic day.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.240
Rob.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.240
What?

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:50.440
You make me weep.

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.440
In my heart.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.720
Well, I mean, I hadn't seen the guy in a while.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.120
I kind of figured he was probably old and dead.

01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.520
I mean, forget it.

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:01.320
Okay, there's people I haven't seen in a while.

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.320
Maybe they're old and dead.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.320
Okay?

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:10.200
When was the last time you saw Molly Ringwald on TV?

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.200
I haven't seen my mother in a while.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.400
Actually, I saw her on TV the other day.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:14.400
So she's not old and dead.

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.720
My wife watches a lot of ABC Family and Lifetime.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.560
Okay, what about Ally Sheedy?

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.960
Who's Ally Sheedy?

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.520
I haven't seen my mother in a week.

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.520
I hope she's okay.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:28.280
Didn't you see the Breakfast Club?

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:30.200
Oh, I don't know any of their names.

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:31.800
She was the crazy girl.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.040
Okay, but I don't know any of their names.

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.720
They're just people in the Breakfast Club.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:44.240
Vidpower in chat says, rise from your grave, Benny Hill.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.840
Raoul Julia is the next Benny Hill.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.840
Tim Curry's still alive.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:49.840
Tim Curry's still doing stuff.

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:50.840
He did spam a lot.

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:51.840
He will never die.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.840
He's not old and dead yet.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:53.840
He's just old.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.840
And gay.

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.840
Next email!

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.840
Yes?

01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.760
Hey guys, I have a question for Loki.

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.440
Hey, Loki!

01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.440
This is AlphaKananagram.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.440
Just curious.

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:11.720
Right now I'm opening my PSP 2001 Slim and Light comma comma comma and I have stripped

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.480
slash have almost stripped the head of one of the top two screws so now I can't try to

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:18.040
fix my D-pad.

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.320
Any suggestions on how to remove the screw or how to fix my D-pad?

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.740
It kept going either left or right and sometimes up or down sometimes if I barely touch right

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:27.980
it'll go left.

01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:30.840
This is the first period he's used in the- sorry, the second period he's used in the

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:31.840
entire email.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.240
Sorry y'all for the grammar.

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.000
Really in the bad situation at the moment.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.660
That's no excuse!

01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.320
Keep on going AlphaKananagram.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:44.840
Sounds like a ribbon cable's looser and possibly some of the contacts are dirty.

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:50.600
I mean, shit, like my friend used to play with one of the 360s that we had and for some

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.920
reason his controller had all sorts of crap on it.

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:57.760
It was just like the dirtiest controller I've ever seen and his PSP is the same way.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.480
I don't know if this guy like oozed out oil and crap or whatever but he did.

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:06.400
So yeah, it could be dirty.

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.400
So check that.

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.400
Otherwise, I don't know.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:12.400
And as far as stripping the screw, hopefully you didn't because that would suck because

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:15.640
there's not really an easy way to get it out.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:21.160
What I did with one of mine that was almost stripped is I just didn't put it back in.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:24.240
Although you should be able to buy- I think they actually sell some of the replacement

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.240
screws online.

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.720
You can buy a kit of like all sorts of miscellaneous parts for the PSP so just buy that.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:38.120
I replaced a shoulder button for one of my PSPs I think one time with kits similar to

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.120
that.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.560
So that'd be the best way to go.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.760
Oh and none of those faceplates, the clear ones, ever seem to fit properly which sucks.

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.880
Because I remember trying to put some of those on too.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.880
The Rob D in chat is trying to say that since I haven't been on TV in a while I'm old and

01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:58.400
dead and I'm young and fabulous.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.400
Tell him that he's wrong.

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.840
WRONG!

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:06.120
And then Rama's trying to piggyback on top of that saying of course Skye would have the

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:08.040
rainbow colored coffin.

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:11.480
And I'm thinking, they have those?

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.720
If there is such a thing, Elton John's got one reserved.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:15.720
Really?

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:20.400
Look, all I ask- This is the platform coffin.

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:31.120
All I ask- All I ask is to be buried with my ABBA albums, that's all I ask.

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.040
Anyhow- You mean the one ABBA album that you have that lives at my house that we haven't

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.000
given you yet?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Actual album?

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Yeah.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
You need to bring it over!

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I want it!

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
I have that Bette Midler one too.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Give me my ABBA!

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.000
It's Supertrooper.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.200
Supertrooper, beams are gonna burn- Alright, anyway.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.200
Anymore emails?

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:52.200
No!

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:58.520
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:06.200
But I think we're to that part of the show where maybe, just maybe, it's about time that

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.680
we give something away!

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:12.720
And we do the match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:13.720
Woohoo!

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.720
Aren't we?

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:15.720
No.

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:28.760
I skipped ahead, false alarm, we'll get to the match game in just a little bit.

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:31.520
Live radio, wasn't that an ultimate tease?

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:35.120
I'm like, no we're not?

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.640
I might want to edit that later if I remember.

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:38.640
We'll see.

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:39.640
We'll pretend it didn't happen.

01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.080
We'll just pretend that didn't happen.

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.360
Let's move on with some more gaming stories.

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.360
Alright.

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:51.840
Well, speaking of how the Playstation 3 was uber awesome in internet browsing, well, the

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.560
Playstation 3 has been used to break the internet as well.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:05.160
In fact, a cluster of Playstation 3s, 200 to be exact, linked together, were able to do

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:10.000
the math to help decrypt the MD5 hash used in VeriSign.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.200
So yes, if you have 200 PS3s lying around linked together, you too can crack supposedly

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:24.240
uncrackable encryption, hurrah.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:28.200
So they're not really worried that anybody's going to crack this other than obviously this

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:34.880
research team, because really, who's sitting on 200 PS3s other than Sony?

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.880
Nobody.

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:36.880
Nobody.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:44.080
There's all those other research labs, remember?

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:47.080
The ones that are actually trying to cure cancer?

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:49.560
Yeah, my PS3 cures cancer.

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.560
It's awesome.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:56.000
Well, hey, I can't buy PS3 games at airports yet, but now you can buy, well, I guess I

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.440
might, but depending on the airport, I actually probably could, but now you can buy a Nintendo

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:04.440
DS and DS games in airports out of a vending machine.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.160
Yeah, these vending machines are pretty high end, but you know, I guess we've seen these

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.120
types of vending machines before that have kind of the really uber expensive stuff.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.120
Like I know they're in Vegas.

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.120
You see them, right?

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.720
Don't you see these things in Vegas, casinos and stuff, like iPods and all that stuff?

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:24.120
Well, now they have these fancy vending machines with expensive DS games and Nintendo DSs in

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.120
them.

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:32.060
Apparently, it's something that Best Buy is doing, and it's at a Best Buy Express vending

01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.060
machine.

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:36.640
These things are at a couple of the different airports throughout the US.

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:41.240
Not only, though, should I point out that they sell the DS and DS games, they sell headphones,

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:43.420
chargers, and so on.

01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:46.920
Now I want to point out, though, that if you've ever flown before, you'll know you actually

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.120
don't want to use the DS, though, during landing and take off.

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:50.120
It's bad.

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.960
And you could crash the plane and get- no, not really, but they'd get really angry at

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.680
you when you do that, so only use it when it's safe.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:00.140
It's kind of neat that they have these sort of kiosks.

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:02.680
We did see one for Sony and stuff.

01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:08.160
Unfortunately, there's also a chain of stores called- oh gosh, now I can't remember what

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.160
the name is.

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:10.160
Airtunes, right?

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:15.080
Not Airtunes, but it's- I don't remember what they're called anyways, but they have a chain

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.920
that's in every single airport that's out there right now, and they also sell the exact

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:24.480
same stuff, and in case you're worried about putting in your credit card and spending hundreds

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:31.400
of dollars on DS systems and stuff like that, and possibly getting stuck in this vending

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:32.400
machine-

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.400
That's what I was going to say.

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:36.400
What happens if the little thing turns and it doesn't fall out?

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.880
Can you imagine me sitting there shaking this vending machine with $100 worth of merchandise?

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.240
I'm sure there's alarms on it and all.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:49.040
But you can actually go to the store and purchase these games face-to-face with people, so I

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:52.480
don't really see the point of why they have this in there, other than another place you

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:53.960
can buy the same shit.

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:54.960
Impulse Buy.

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.520
Mommy, I want one!

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.920
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.840
Leo Shen calls it a Super Plane Crasher DS.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:05.880
Black Wolf says, now do the DS's come already charged, or do you have to charge it in the

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.000
airport before you get on the plane?

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.600
And Rama says his did come charged already.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.880
Have the DS's come charged in the box?

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.960
From what I remember, my original DS, and I think my DS, I think I had to charge both

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:18.960
of those.

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.960
Did you?

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:20.960
Hahaha!

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:21.960
Sucks for them.

01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:25.600
Yeah, because then how do you charge them before you get on the plane?

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.160
Of course, then, you know, airports, it's really easy to charge a laptop at an airport.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.160
There's plugs everywhere.

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.880
Yeah, but you cannot have the convenience or time to do that.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.120
And better yet, I mean, really, do you really want to buy electronics at an airport?

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:41.920
I mean, I can understand a game, you know, I bought headphones because my headphones

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.200
sucked because I had these stupid earbuds and I wanted something different, but, really,

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:52.000
a DS system, you're like, hey, you know, I really wish I had DS.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.380
I think this is more for, like, gifts and stuff like that, like, crap, I gotta get my

01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:02.040
son a gift, and I am stupid and didn't think about getting him anything.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:05.920
Oh, hey, look, a vending machine, let me buy some useless crap.

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:12.160
Yeah, the problem is they also have porn in the airport, and that's very sad.

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:15.000
Well, because, you know, you shouldn't be looking at porn on a plane.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.800
That's not going to crash a plane that does not interfere with their taking off or landing.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.880
Yeah, but there might be children sitting behind you.

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.880
Screw the children.

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:22.880
No thank you.

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.600
Unless you're sitting in the very back row by yourself, then you can look at all the

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.600
porn you want.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.840
Wait, wait, wait, if you get a, if you can, if they sell a PSP, you can look up porn on

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.960
the PSP, because we all know the PSP is a gateway to porn.

01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:37.240
But you can't look at the internet while you're on a fucking airplane.

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:42.400
Ah, but you can put pictures and encode videos onto your memory.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.400
All at the airport?

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.400
Yes, all at the airport.

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.400
Seriously.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:54.520
If you're going to go to that extreme lengths of trouble just to look at porn, why don't

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.360
you just bring a Playboy on the goddamn plane?

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.000
And you know what else you could do, too, is use one of those TV devices that they had,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.160
remember those wonderful TV devices that they don't sell anymore, that act like a projector,

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.440
and project it onto the ceiling of the cabin.

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440
You have issues.

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.160
Alright.

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.840
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:18.680
We have one more story before we get to match game tonight.

01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:22.720
Well, I like Legos.

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:25.080
And I like Rock Band.

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:29.640
And there's a rumor going around that those are two great tastes that taste great together.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:32.480
Tastes great.

01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.480
Less filling.

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:34.480
Tastes great.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:35.480
Less...

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:41.800
So, yeah, the rumor is that there is going to be a Lego Rock Band.

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.880
That's all I can say.

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:47.800
There's no confirmation.

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.840
There's a...

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:54.320
Some dude's uncle works for Lego and heard, right?

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.880
There's supposed to be a Lego title coming out.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:02.640
But Lego Rock Band, dude, can't they find something...

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.640
I guess it's not the dumbest rumor I've ever heard.

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.880
Wasn't there a White Stripes video made completely out of Legos, if I remember right?

01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.120
I think.

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.200
That's the only thing I could think of that could possibly tie into Legos and Rock Band.

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200
This is bunk.

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.200
It's gotta be bullshit.

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.200
It's gotta be.

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.360
And you know why this is completely bunk?

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.240
Is because you have to understand the way they make Lego games.

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:26.300
For example, it's a specific chain of events.

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:32.880
You have the toy that they make first, then you make the video game.

01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.040
Just like they've had, you know, I believe they have the Lego Indiana Jones toys.

01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.480
I know they have the Lego Star Wars toys.

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:45.200
I know that they have the Lego Racer toys and stuff like that.

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:50.980
So the next logical step for me, and seeing as that the rumor is EA is going to be publishing

01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:58.320
it would be Lego Harry Potter, because, you know, they need another Lego game, and that

01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.160
makes perfect sense for me that they would be able to pump out two more Lego games based

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:07.680
around the Harry Potter movies, and they already have toys to go along with it.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:13.360
So Rock Band wouldn't make any sense at all because there's no reason for them to buy...

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.520
Why would you even want to, I mean, you'd have to make special peripherals for it.

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.080
There's no Lego themed music to go along with it.

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.660
It would just be like a reskin of Rock Band.

01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:28.460
It would be kind of crap, is what it would be.

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:33.560
It would be not kind of crap, it would be totally crap.

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:37.120
Tiger Claw is suggesting Lego Transformers would be another logical step.

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.600
But see, they don't have a toy for that.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:42.000
Remember it's toy, then game.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.800
It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, the game.

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:51.240
Like they're not going to just all of a sudden make, you know, Lego Halo or something like

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:52.240
that.

01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:54.280
Unless they make Lego Halo toys first.

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.800
It's toy in game, because Lego's not going to just put their license out there unless

01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:00.540
they have something to benefit from it.

01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:02.760
Now you know what this has started in the chat room.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:12.080
Now we have Frisbee says Lego of Persia, Bricks of Time, GS68 says BeatMania 2DX Legos, GS68

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:19.640
says Imagine Legos, Drew, even though he's sitting right behind me, says Lego Crisis,

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:24.480
Lego International Superstar Soccer, Lego on a Prayer, Lego Sonic the Hedgehog, Little

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.960
Big Legos.

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:33.880
Anyhow, now that's a good question from Kazam is what about the Lego MMO?

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:35.960
That's a good question.

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:37.600
Orange Lego Radio?

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.480
Alright, forget it, cooking Legos.

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:41.480
Alright, forget it.

01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:42.480
Enough.

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.480
Stop.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.480
Knock it off.

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.680
We have something much better to look forward to.

01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:51.360
We are now going to play the match game.

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.360
Yes, I'm sure we're going to play the match game.

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.020
Tonight for the match game we have five fabulous celebrities joining us in the studio.

01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:02.280
Say hello to the one and only Loki.

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:08.760
Hello and to Pod Culture in the, or Brad from Pod Culture.

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.540
There is no Lego Transformer toys.

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:15.160
There are Transformer toys, but not Lego Transformer toys.

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.520
Alright, whatever.

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.360
Also, say hello to Intern Drew, who is one of our other fabulous celebrity panelists

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.360
tonight.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.360
Yo, what's up?

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:29.240
And also joining us, say hello to Dark Soccer on the celebrity panel.

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:33.280
And also on our celebrity panel tonight, Giggling Girl Sauce.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:35.960
Giggling Gamer Geek Girls Unite.

01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:36.960
Yay!

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:37.960
Activate.

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:46.120
Alright, and of course, also on the celebrity panel tonight, the most fabulous of them all,

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:47.120
me.

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:50.800
Alright, let's get to tonight's match game.

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:56.280
First off, we have nine people who caught my uber secret message in chat to send me

01:52:56.280 --> 01:53:03.200
a tell to play, so if you wouldn't mind sauce, pick a number between one and nine.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.200
Lucky number seven.

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:08.440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:12.200
The seventh person to send me a tell tonight was X-Link.

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:18.920
So X-Link is going to play from chat.

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:21.600
And I'm telling him to please stand by.

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:25.360
We'll need to explain the rules for match game while I open up the Skype line to the

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:31.080
first person to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:36.040
you want to play against X-Link for that $25 gift certificate.

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:41.800
Alright, somebody explain the rules of match game, hurry.

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:42.800
Dark Sakura.

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:48.440
We're reading a bunch of crap, and it ends, but it ends incomplete and you gotta complete

01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:49.440
it.

01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.440
With a word.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:51.440
Or phrase.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.440
Sorry, go ahead.

01:53:52.440 --> 01:54:00.960
Like if I said, I went to the blank, you'd have to pick something.

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.960
And X-Link just told me he has no idea how to play, so this should be fun tonight.

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:08.200
You have to try and match what we are thinking.

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.960
Yes, you gotta match what we are thinking.

01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.120
We're gonna send you something with a blank in it, and you tell me over private message

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.680
what you think should be in the blank.

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:17.520
Oh, and good luck.

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:20.880
Hurry up and go to YouTube and type in Match Game 76.

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.980
There's no time, there's no time.

01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.320
We do have a caller on the Skype line.

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.680
Hi caller, who's this?

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:30.240
Hi, this is Ronma, aka DJ Ronma.

01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.240
They're gonna say it's rigged.

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.240
They're gonna say it's rigged.

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:38.840
No way, he's got mad skills, and it's fitting he should be our first phone contestant of

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.840
the year.

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:42.360
He has a flaming finger when it comes to dialing.

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:43.360
So there you go.

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:47.160
Alright, now Ronma, do you know how to play Match Game?

01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:51.480
Ronma, do you know how to play Match Game?

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.080
Why, yes I do.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.800
Why yes you do, alright.

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:59.480
Can you explain X-Link how to play?

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:06.240
Damn it, I hosted a Match Game one time, I can't remember, oh god, I'm so sorry.

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:07.240
That's alright.

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:09.480
Fill in the blank with what you think we're gonna say.

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:11.480
That's the best way we can explain it.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:18.560
Okay, so the winner tonight will get a $25 gift certificate to Amazon.com courtesy of

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:21.600
Avengers Tower, your favorite giggling game girl blog.

01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.160
No, I shouldn't keep saying that because then people are gonna think that's really true,

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:27.840
but it's actually, it's irony because if you go read it, it's actually very well thought

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.940
out and very well done.

01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:31.440
It's irony, it's a case of irony.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:37.480
And the loser tonight gets their face melted off with an Xbox 360 laser gun, so don't lose.

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.040
Alright, sound good, Ronma?

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.040
Works for me.

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:42.040
Alright.

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:47.640
The whole chat room is yelling, rigged, rigged.

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:52.000
Do you have anything to say to the chat room before we begin tonight?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.720
I'm sorry, I can't help but have the fastest internet connection in the chat.

01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:57.720
Alright, oh snap.

01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.160
Alright, here we go.

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.160
Question number one tonight.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.200
Are you ready for question number one?

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:04.640
Now don't say the answer because we all have to write down here in studio and if you blurred

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:09.320
it out, then you automatically lose and get shot in the face with an Xbox 360 zapper,

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:10.320
okay?

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.480
Alright, so here is question number one tonight.

01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:17.080
And XLink, you send me your answer over a private message.

01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.820
Dark Sakura, as you know, no you're in the question.

01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:25.440
Dark Sakura, as you know, doesn't like to sing in front of people.

01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:28.940
She snubs SingStar and laughs at lips.

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:35.000
The whole reason for this is that she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.840
For Your Blank.

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:44.600
Dark Sakura is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game.

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.640
It's called Sing For Your Blank.

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:51.960
Everyone here in studio is trying to cook up an answer and just say ding when you're

01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.560
done so I know you have it.

01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:58.240
Dark Sakura burped.

01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:02.040
Okay, ding.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:03.720
I changed my answer last minute.

01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.720
Ah, ding.

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:05.720
Ding and Tiara?

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.080
Alright, Tiara, ding.

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.040
I'm just waiting for our chatroom contestant to give an answer.

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.720
Rama, do you know an answer yet?

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.720
Yes, I do.

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:13.720
Ding.

01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:14.720
Alright.

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:21.480
I'm waiting on our chatroom contestant, XLink.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.760
Can you send me something?

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:25.760
I just typed hurry.

01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.360
Okay, there we go.

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.360
We have an answer.

01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:30.880
Alright.

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.560
Sometimes it could be the obvious answer, sometimes it's not obvious.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:34.560
Alright.

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:37.720
The whole reason for this is that she's waiting for an ultimate karaoke game called Sing For

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:38.720
Your...

01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:39.720
Rama?

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.720
Sing For Your...

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:41.720
Alcohol.

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:45.300
Sing For Your Alcohol, says Rama.

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:50.120
Our chatter, XLink, says she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing For

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:53.120
Your Life, says the chatter.

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:54.320
Sing For Your Life.

01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:57.720
Alright, DarkSakura, we'll start with you on this question.

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.480
Sing For Your...

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:02.680
We already have a match.

01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:03.680
What is it?

01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:04.680
I was gonna say booze.

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:05.680
Sing For Your Booze.

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:08.280
Oh my gosh, this game's super rigged tonight.

01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.320
Rama already got a point.

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.720
Alright, well, let's see what happens.

01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:13.400
Rama, you're on the board with a point.

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:14.400
Congratulations.

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:15.400
Sing For Your Booze.

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:16.400
We have a match.

01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.400
Yay, match.

01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.400
Yay.

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:19.400
That's amazing.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:22.920
This is the first time in the history of this game, we matched on the very first answer

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:27.560
because we go through, we've gone through games and games where nobody ever matches

01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.300
a goddamn thing.

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:31.120
This is epic match game tonight.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:34.280
Sauce, she made a karaoke game called Sing For Your...

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:37.640
I think this will possibly count for a match.

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:39.600
I said Sing For Your Survival.

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:42.720
Please remove that shotgun from my head.

01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:44.400
Sing For Your Survival.

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:45.400
Will we count it?

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:46.400
Yeah.

01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.880
No, we're gonna count it as a match, yay.

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:49.960
So now it's tied up.

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:51.080
One for Rama.

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:52.080
One for X-Link.

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.080
Okay, Loki.

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:54.240
Sing For Your...

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.240
Life.

01:58:55.240 --> 01:58:56.240
Oh!

01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:58.280
X-Link pulls ahead with two.

01:58:58.280 --> 01:58:59.280
Sing For Your Life.

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:00.280
Two to one.

01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:04.840
I couldn't think of anything so, you know, that's the first thing that I came up with.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:05.840
Alright.

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:07.320
Trying to be clever.

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:08.320
Drunami.

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:09.840
Sing For Your...

01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:10.840
Guardian Legend Remake.

01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:12.480
Guardian Legend Remake.

01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.360
Oh, good, but not a match.

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:17.400
And I said, I don't think this is gonna be a match.

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:20.120
I said Sing For Your Child's Freedom.

01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:21.120
Also...

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:24.360
Does Jamie really play that?

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:25.360
Well, it's...

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:28.800
I don't know if Jamie would play it, but like, I don't know, it would be something I could

01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:31.200
see that they would have at Golf Land, so there you have it.

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.000
Sing For Your Child's Freedom.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Unfortunately not a match.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
You alright there, Jamie?

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Alright.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Dork.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.040
Alright, here we go.

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:42.520
So it's X-Link 2, Rama 1.

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:45.600
Alright, so Rama, I don't know if it's rigged.

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:46.600
We'll see.

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:47.600
Oh, yeah.

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.600
Alright, Rama.

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:49.600
You have four.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:50.600
It's an epic match game tonight.

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:51.680
There's four more chances to catch up.

01:59:51.680 --> 01:59:52.960
Here we go.

01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:55.080
Question number two.

01:59:55.080 --> 02:00:02.040
Rob, hey, that's me, is planning early for this year's E3.

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:06.560
He already reserved his plane tickets and his tickets to the show.

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:12.240
When asked why he was going so early, he exclaimed, I'm just so excited to go back this year and

02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:14.240
see all the blank.

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.240
Ding!

02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:33.640
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

02:00:33.640 --> 02:01:01.360
I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the booth babes.

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:10.360
booth babes says Rama. X-link says I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the games.

02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:17.360
That seems like a pretty fucking obvious answer, right? Let's see, I don't know, let's see.

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:24.360
Did we go for the obvious or did we go for crazy? I don't know, let's see.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.360
We'll start again with Dark Sakura. I can't wait to go and see all the...

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:34.360
Fanboy Wank. Fanboy Wank.

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:37.360
I don't think technically that's a match, I'm sorry.

02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.360
Sauce, I can't wait to go back and see all the...

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:45.360
Previews for Sing Star Journey. Previews for Sing Star Journey.

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:50.360
I don't think that's a match with games. Games is too broad, but that's a good, that's a very good answer.

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.360
Very good, you know me very well.

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:59.360
Loki, he can't wait to go back and see the... This is totally opposite of what you'd probably say anyways, but I said...

02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:04.360
All the Paris Hilton games. All the Paris Hilton games, ew.

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:09.360
Maybe in an alternate universe. Does that match with just games though? I don't, I don't think it does.

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:12.360
I'm sorry, sorry X-links, too, too, too broad.

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:14.360
Alright, uh...

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:22.360
Drewnami, can't wait to go back and see all the... Fucking ABBA music games. Fucking ABBA music games.

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.360
Alright, good answer, but not a match.

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.360
And I said, now this is going to be tricky, okay, here's what I said. I said...

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:32.360
Rob said, I can't wait to go back and see all the...

02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.360
Military men, is what I said. But does that count for booth babes?

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:40.360
I think so. You think so?

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:44.360
Yeah. That's like a booth babe for me.

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.360
Yeah, babe can go either way.

02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:51.360
Babe can go either way. Alright, Rama, we're going to give you a point for matching on that one.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.360
Even though you got the wrong gender.

02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:56.360
Woohoo!

02:02:56.360 --> 02:03:00.360
Who cares about gender here on Orange Lounge Radio? Alright.

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.360
There we go, we gave him a point for that.

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:07.360
Alright, so it's all tied up and the chat room is complaining that it's rigged.

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:10.360
Hey, it's my gift card. I can tell if it counts or not.

02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:13.360
That's right. There you go. Oh snap.

02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:17.360
You just got, the chat room, you just got served by a giggling geek girl.

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.360
I just want to point out.

02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.360
Alright. Anyhow, let's get to question number three.

02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.360
And you know it's a Loki question.

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.360
Alright, here we go. Question number three in tonight's match game, epic match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:36.360
Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.360
He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:46.360
They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.

02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:59.360
Alright, Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.360
He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:08.360
They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.360
I ding.

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:18.360
I'm going to ding.

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:27.360
Alright, Rama, did you ding?

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:28.360
Ding?

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:29.360
Alright, here we go.

02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:32.360
Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.360
He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:39.360
They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of erotica.

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:40.360
Erotica.

02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:45.360
Alright, and X-Link said, nude ladies.

02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:47.360
So, it's almost the same thing.

02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:50.360
So, this is just playing for points at this point, racking up the points.

02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:55.360
So, Dark Sakura, you can't have pictures of big black cock.

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.360
Big black cock.

02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:00.360
Not a match and erotica is too broad.

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.360
What?

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:03.360
Sorry, that's not a match.

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:04.360
Sorry, that's not a match.

02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:06.360
Loki has firmly said that's not a match.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:09.360
Alright, Tiara, you can't have pictures of?

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.360
Iraqi suicide babies.

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.360
Iraqi suicide babies.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:16.360
That is actually the first thing I put down and I changed it.

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:17.360
That's amazing.

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.360
Alright, not a match.

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:25.360
But you know, if I am going to make a level, it will have Iraqi suicide babies in there.

02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:29.360
Alright, Loki, you can't have pictures of?

02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:32.360
Um, blood and tits.

02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:34.360
That's what I put in mine.

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.360
Blood and tits.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.360
Blood and tits.

02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:37.360
That's fairly erotic.

02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:44.360
But I feel like if we're going to give it to Rama, then we also need to give it to X-Link for nude ladies.

02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:46.360
Alright, so why not? We'll give them both a point.

02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:47.360
Why not?

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:49.360
Alright, yay, a point for everybody.

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:51.360
Yay, blood and tits.

02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:56.360
Alright, Drew, you can't have pictures of?

02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:58.360
Iraqi suicide babies.

02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.360
Iraqi suicide babies.

02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:04.360
And my answer was, you can't have pictures of?

02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.360
Cylon occupied Caprica.

02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.360
Because it's copyrighted.

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.360
See, I went from one OLR joke to another.

02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:11.360
That's what I did.

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:12.360
There you go.

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:15.360
You can't have pictures of Cylon occupied Caprica.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:18.360
But see, Iraqi suicide babies is not copyrighted.

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:21.360
But Cylon occupied Caprica is. That's why I changed it.

02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.360
I'll put a fucking copyright on it.

02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:24.360
Alright.

02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.360
Alright.

02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:30.360
I love some of the answers the chatroom came up with here.

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.360
This is great.

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:33.360
Two men kissing was one of them.

02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:37.360
Uh, pictures of Sky's old public access show.

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.360
Tingle.

02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:40.360
I didn't even think of that one. That's a great one.

02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.360
Tingle penis.

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:43.360
Lego tingle.

02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.360
I have judgement.

02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:47.360
Alright, good job.

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:48.360
Alright.

02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:49.360
We have more.

02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.360
Rama, it's all tied up. How you feeling?

02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:54.360
I feel the pressure's on me.

02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:55.360
The pressure is fucking on.

02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:56.360
Alright, here we go.

02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:59.360
Question number four.

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.360
Now they're not about the host anymore.

02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:03.360
This is gonna get out there a little bit.

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.360
Alright.

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:09.360
Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.

02:07:09.360 --> 02:07:11.360
That's right, we're gonna be having a rave.

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:17.360
However, instead of a cuddle room, they'll have a blank room.

02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:36.360
Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.

02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:41.360
However, instead of a cuddle room, they'll have a blank room.

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:48.360
Ding.

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.360
Alright.

02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.360
Rama, did you ding?

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:53.360
Ding.

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:55.360
Alright, I'm just waiting on our chatter.

02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.360
Alright.

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:04.360
Oh my god.

02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:05.360
Alright.

02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.360
Wow.

02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:09.360
That's what happens when the pressure's on.

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.360
I'll read his answer in a minute.

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:12.360
Alright.

02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:13.360
Orange...

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:14.360
Wow.

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.360
What kind of raves do you think we have?

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:20.360
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.

02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:24.360
However, instead of a cuddle room, they will have a...

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:25.360
Pyramid Head room.

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:27.360
Pyramid Head room.

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.360
Alright, well maybe that's where this answer comes from.

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:30.360
What time is it?

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:35.360
X-Link says they will have a rape room.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:39.360
Okay.

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:43.360
I know, that's why I gaffed in horror when I read the answer.

02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:48.360
Well, let's see if Pyramid Head or rape, or preferably both, comes up.

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:49.360
So let's see.

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:51.360
Dark Sakura, they will have a...

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:52.360
Fanboy wank.

02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:54.360
Fanboy wank room.

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:58.360
That almost is Pyramid Head, almost, but not quite.

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.360
Alright, Sauce, they will have a...

02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:02.360
Drunken Booze room.

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:05.360
Drunken Booze room, of course you gotta have a drunk room.

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.360
I advocate this.

02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.360
Alright, Loki, the OLR rave will have a...

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.360
Light switch rave room.

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.360
Light switch rave room.

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.360
That's a damn good answer, good job.

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.360
Drew, they will have a...

02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:20.360
A champagne room.

02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:21.360
A champagne room.

02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:24.360
No, there's champagne in the champagne room.

02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:27.360
You ass.

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:28.360
Alright.

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:31.360
And I said that they will have a...

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:33.360
Gun room.

02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:36.360
Come on, cause you all have guns.

02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:38.360
Of course there's gonna be a gun room.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:39.360
Alright.

02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.360
Still tied up, 3-3.

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:43.360
What the hell happens if we have a tie?

02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:44.360
Oh shit.

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:47.360
We have to play all night long until the tie is broken.

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:48.360
It's like baseball.

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.360
Alright, here we go.

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:50.360
Shit.

02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:51.360
Alright.

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:54.360
Alright.

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:58.360
Here we go with the last question tonight, which hopefully someone will match on.

02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.360
Here we go.

02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:06.360
Little did you know that Drew Nami is here tonight to steal your prize.

02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:12.360
Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on blank.

02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:15.360
Ding.

02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:18.360
Little did you know that Drew is here tonight to steal your prize.

02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:24.360
Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on blank.

02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:26.360
Ding.

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:30.360
Ding.

02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:32.360
Did you ding Dark Sock right in here?

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:33.360
I did.

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:34.360
Alright.

02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:35.360
I think everybody's dinged.

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.360
I think I heard Rama ding.

02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:37.360
That was quick.

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:38.360
Yep.

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:43.360
Alright.

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:46.360
Rama, little did you know that Drew is here tonight to steal your prize.

02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:50.360
Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on...

02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:51.360
Warcraft.

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:53.360
Warcraft.

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:59.360
And X-Link says he was planning on spending the gift card on porn.

02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:00.360
Pornography.

02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:01.360
Alright, let's see.

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:04.360
We got two pretty extreme different answers there.

02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:06.360
This could make all the difference.

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:07.360
Dark Sakura.

02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:10.360
He's spending the gift card on...

02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:11.360
Porn.

02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:12.360
Porn!

02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:15.360
Ooh, X-Link pulls ahead, but it's not over yet.

02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:17.360
It's not over yet.

02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:18.360
Alright.

02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.360
Sauce.

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:24.360
She said she couldn't use fanboy wank again.

02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.360
Alright.

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:29.360
Sauce, he's gonna spend the gift card on...

02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.360
I actually did say Warcraft.

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:32.360
Warcraft.

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.360
Oh man, it's tied again.

02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:36.360
Oh man, it's back to 4-4.

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:37.360
Let's see.

02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:38.360
Alright.

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.360
Amazing.

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:40.360
Alright, Loki.

02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.360
He's gonna spend the gift card on...

02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:44.360
I didn't say either of those.

02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:46.360
I said Better Joke Books.

02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:47.360
Better Joke Books.

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:49.360
Oh, he might need that.

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:50.360
Alright.

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:52.360
So, uh, Drew?

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:54.360
It's come down to you and me.

02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:55.360
Maybe one of us matches.

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:56.360
He's gonna...

02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.360
You want me to go first?

02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:58.360
I think you should.

02:11:58.360 --> 02:11:59.360
Alright, you think I should?

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:03.360
Alright, I said he's gonna spend his gift card on...

02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:05.360
A life.

02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:06.360
Boo.

02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:08.360
But I put a heart next to it, so it's okay.

02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.360
It's just a joke.

02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:11.360
But he's gonna spend his gift card on actually getting a life.

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.360
I'm just kidding.

02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:13.360
Love you, bro.

02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:14.360
Alright.

02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:17.360
Drew, he's gonna spend the gift card on...

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:25.360
Getting Kim to California, you fucking perverts.

02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:27.360
So the match came in tonight in a tie.

02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:28.360
What do we do in case of a tie?

02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:29.360
Lie Radio.

02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:30.360
Do we have to do another question?

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:33.360
No, I get the gift card just as planned.

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:34.360
No, no, Drew.

02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:35.360
I'll do one, I'll do one, I'll do one.

02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.360
You're gonna do one?

02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:37.360
I'll do one, I'll do one.

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:38.360
Alright, one more question.

02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:39.360
This is coming from...

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:41.360
Completely off the top of my head.

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.360
I'm a little worried about this one.

02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:45.360
You have to talk fast, because I have to message it to X-Link, okay?

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.360
Okay.

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:47.360
Alright, go.

02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:53.360
During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up

02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:57.360
another question for match game.

02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:03.360
So instead, they decided to settle the tie by a blank.

02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:14.360
I repeat, if I can remember, during an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, they had a tie in

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:20.360
the match game, and they couldn't think up another question, so they had to solve the

02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:25.360
tie by a blank.

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:28.360
Ding.

02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:31.360
Ding.

02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:37.360
I don't know, how do you guys get your answers so fast?

02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:43.360
Because I did the obvious answer.

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:49.360
Don't be giving things away.

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:51.360
Just kidding, I didn't...

02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:52.360
Just kidding.

02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:57.360
I wouldn't say that, it's retarded.

02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.360
God, I don't know.

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:14.360
Okay, I've typed out my answer, it's long and dramatic.

02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:18.360
Alright, I'm waiting on X-Link.

02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:21.360
During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:26.360
another question for match game, so instead they decided to settle a tie by a blank.

02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.360
Uh, which I'm waiting on X-Link still.

02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:38.360
La la, la la, match game music, match game music, porn porn, blank blank.

02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:45.360
I'm reading some of the comments in chat, they're pretty bad.

02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:46.360
Butt sex battle?

02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:47.360
Really?

02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:49.360
Really?

02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:50.360
Alright.

02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:52.360
Come on!

02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:56.360
It's by, uh, inflammation.

02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:59.360
To see who's more inflamed.

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:00.360
Is he still in chat?

02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:02.360
Or did we scare him off?

02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:06.360
Are you there?

02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:08.360
Do we have an answer?

02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.360
I like what the Rob D says in chat.

02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:12.360
The OLR match game wouldn't end, and DMN was spamming in chat.

02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:18.360
Skye then said to DMN, you better stop that, you asspiper, or I'll blank.

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:20.360
Maybe that'll be the next question.

02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:21.360
Who knows, we'll see.

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:28.360
Alright, if X-Link doesn't give me an answer in like 15 seconds, I am discounting his answer this round.

02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.360
And Rama will have to match by himself.

02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:31.360
So here we go.

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:43.360
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:44.360
Oh, oh, oh!

02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:45.360
There it is.

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.360
Happy New Year.

02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:47.360
There it is.

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.360
Alright, finally.

02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:51.360
Rama, during an episode of OLR, there was a tie and they couldn't think of another one.

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:54.360
So they decided to sell a tie by?

02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:57.360
A fight to the flaming death.

02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:00.360
A fight to the flaming death.

02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:10.360
And X-Link said, a fight.

02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:15.360
However, however, I think we might have a way to break the tie.

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:16.360
So, hold on.

02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:19.360
Alright, so Dark Sakura.

02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:22.360
They decided to settle the score by?

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:23.360
A fight to the finish.

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:25.360
A fight to the finish.

02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:28.360
Alright, so that's a point for each.

02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:30.360
Alright, Sauce.

02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.360
They decided to settle the score by?

02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:33.360
Sing Star ABBA Showdown.

02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:35.360
Sing Star ABBA Showdown!

02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:37.360
That's a fight to the death.

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:38.360
That's a wonderful answer.

02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:40.360
Alright, Loki.

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:43.360
They decided to settle the score by?

02:16:43.360 --> 02:17:06.240
her you know I just give Loki the gift card honestly I don't know why that's so

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:15.760
funny and I'm not even drunk all right well okay they decided to settle the

02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:27.120
score by oh I'm sorry drew side so score by two men enter one man leaves this is

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:30.880
Thunderdome a fight to the finish all right so a point for each of them a

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:38.220
fight another fight okay here's the thing though here's my answer they

02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:43.360
decided to settle the score by setting the studio on fire but please don't

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:49.680
actually do this but I'm thinking Rama did say a fight to the flaming finish so

02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:58.080
it might match with Rama all right so you wanna we are we're still in a tie so

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:03.440
what happens does neither one win one more question oh this segment is getting

02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:09.120
way too long read the one that the Rob D right we do Rob D's question all right

02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:12.360
this is it I swear to God if we don't have a winner here then I don't know

02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:14.360
we're just give it away next week or something I don't know what we're gonna

02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:28.040
do here it is or we'll flip a damn coin says Brad okay we are

02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:32.320
back on orange lounge radio I I think we're still here we had a little bit of

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:36.280
technical difficulty during the tiebreaker our very climatic tiebreaker

02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:42.280
here on orange launch radio and our little table that houses the actual

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:47.380
mixing board and had some various items sitting on it actually buckled like the

02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:51.880
damn thing just like all over if it fainted from the pressure of match game

02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.600
apparently and it knocked our sound board over and it ended up pulling out

02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:01.680
all the core that were in it and all that stuff so that's why the suddenly

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:05.920
the show went dead for those you guys that were listening live Frisbee says

02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:09.640
don't edit this out of the podcast this part won't be but probably the minutes

02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:12.680
and minutes long of silence will need to be because people will think their iPods

02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:19.080
broke so there you go all right so who there you have it all right so we are

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:24.240
gonna try one more time to resolve this whole match game thing going on right

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:31.640
now oh yeah do we why we can't do the Rob D's question okay we'll do that all

02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:37.560
right so we're gonna do the Rob D's question and this hopefully will fix

02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:43.720
what's going on here and then we can get on with our lives all right here it is

02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:49.240
last question for the match game night the olr match game wouldn't end in DMN

02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:53.720

02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:58.960

an HD DVD laser burn your face off melt your face off of the laser not a match

02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:36.320
all right and my answer was cuddle with you which might also be considered a

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:43.200
form of violation but it doesn't matter because Rama wins by a point at least so

02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:52.840

02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:46.040
minutes long according to Ramos call dear Lord well keep in mind you know for

02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:53.440
about five minutes of that we were experiencing technical difficulties all

02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:58.240
right so to everybody who didn't win tonight boohoo for you but we got some

02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:00.720
more news to do and then we're gonna take a couple quick quick calls tonight

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:03.120
unfortunately got to keep it short tonight because we did not expect match

02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:05.800
game to take so long I apologize for that but you know what it was a slow

02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:11.680
news week so deal just deal okay deal Loki have some news haven't you ever

02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:15.320
thought to yourself when playing a game of pinball gee I wish I could learn

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:20.880
about flatulence right now well now you can thanks to a custom pinball game

02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:29.040
called gas attack that was part of a exhibit in gross ology apparently these

02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:35.760
two exhibits or this part of the exhibit your pinball is actually bacteria and

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:42.400
you bump it into different foods that cause flatulence including meat onions

02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:51.520
you name it and yes cabbage is on there brussel or brussel sprouts cheese all

02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:58.280
sorts of stuff and they do have a picture of intestines right above it is

02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:05.200
that the ramp no that's not the ramp the ramp there's actually a few clear ramps

02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:09.000
that are in there but it has like a toilet and a bunch of other stuff on

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.720
there pretty basic looking but I get some message across I guess that is

02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:17.480
something else that's amazing you know where yeah frisbee asked the question I

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:24.680
want to know where can I play this you know I'm not sure where this exhibits

02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:34.720
actually at but it's yeah some gross ology exhibit that's touring so I will

02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:40.440
find out gross ology that sounds pretty amazing all right I don't is this a

02:24:40.440 --> 02:24:43.080
pinball game that you want to play dark soccer I mean you do play lots of

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:48.840
pinball games you want to play the fart game no I had to ask well I don't know

02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:53.600
if this game is gonna be any better or worse but oh sorry real quick yeah you

02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:57.960
can actually find out more about the gross ology tour by going to gross ology

02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:02.800
tour calm and they have I think the dates that they'll be available well how

02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:08.760
convenient all right well hey if that game doesn't sound like your your idea

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:13.320
of a good time maybe this one will be a little better it's push-up foo is a new

02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:17.900
game that has come out for the iPhone it's a part of a series called the foo

02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:23.680
apps like Shaq foo but this is called the push-up foo and apparently what this

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:28.680
is it uses the device's accelerometer to track how many push-ups you're doing and

02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:33.140
give you feedback on how you're doing with your push-ups so that's kind of

02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:36.620
interesting I guess I don't know if you put the thing on your back or something

02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:39.160
or where you put this when you're doing your push-ups but I guess it actually

02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:42.800
tracks how many push-ups you're doing and how well you've done but here's the

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:47.800
other cool thing push-up foo also lets you join a tracked league or you can go

02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:52.220
head-to-head in what's called a battle mode apparently there's a course in it

02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:57.460
that makes you it trains you to do a hundred and push-ups in it so that's

02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:01.460
that's kind of an interesting use for the iPhone kind of like throwing a Wii

02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:07.220
Fit angle into it or teaching you how to shake or tilt the iPhone into thinking

02:26:07.220 --> 02:26:11.860
that you've done a hundred push-ups for real huh just like how you can shake the

02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:17.220
remote it makes you think that her makes Wii Fit think you're jogging but you

02:26:17.220 --> 02:26:20.500
know this might actually be kind of a fun competitive way like to do like if

02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:23.860
you and your friends are doing it for like actual push-ups this might be kind

02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:27.100
of a fun way to motivate people I don't know I hope they come out with other

02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:34.620
versions of it we'll see gs68 says you put it in your pants I always put it in

02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:39.680
my pants all right anyhow I don't know I it looks interesting if it's free I'll

02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:46.660
check it out if it's not then I probably won't well I actually I I have this that

02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:53.820
I'm reporting on next you can get game and watch games on your iPhone and I've

02:26:53.820 --> 02:27:03.540
downloaded two of them basically they they're done a little differently but

02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:09.220
they still really are the game and watch games you've got parachute chef fire and

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:17.140
octopus but they're called gw parachute gw chef gw fire gw octopus they're

02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:25.500
dollar-99 and then wait till Nintendo hears about it yeah hurry before a

02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:30.540
cease-and-desist gets sent it's pretty fun which will probably fire you better

02:27:30.540 --> 02:27:36.460
get him now there you go you know I saw something on one of those gaming blogs I

02:27:36.460 --> 02:27:42.500
was talking about an app that wasn't accepted into my apples app store there

02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:48.420
apparently it was a booby shaking game that you can shake your iPhone in the

02:27:48.420 --> 02:27:54.220
boob shake awesome and this wasn't accepted why because apparently it's

02:27:54.220 --> 02:28:03.380
inappropriate for people I don't know whatever yeah whatever there is a new

02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:08.820
exploit that's been found in the PSP you may remember before that they were doing

02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:14.300
buffer overflows with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and I think before

02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:19.860
that I can't remember whether games they were using to do that but now the newest

02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:25.020
game to be able to do this is actually a very old game grip shift apparently

02:28:25.020 --> 02:28:29.340
someone found an exploit in it where you can also do a similar buffer overflow

02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:36.180
and it allows you to load modified save games which you can run all sorts of

02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:40.460
homebrew programs but the most important thing about this is it works on the PSP

02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:47.880
3000 and will eventually lead to custom firmwares on the PSP 3000 so try as you

02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:56.500
may Sony it will never ever ever ever work so in other words they just need to

02:28:56.500 --> 02:29:00.020
give up on patching it out they should just give up but hey you know they want

02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:04.180
they don't think they kind of owe it to the people that you know and make games

02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:09.740
for their system to yeah I guess whatever will never ever work well hey

02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:14.220

02:30:01.780 --> 02:30:10.260
to put it off you oh my gosh F me how horrible we should have put it in now

02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:12.980
right after the table collapsed that would have been a good time to do it

02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:21.300
all right all right let's get to the F use of the week then since I when I

02:30:21.300 --> 02:30:26.380
forget to put in the F use in the show role I get pretty pissed off at myself

02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:49.940
if you goes to be woken up from a deep sleep this morning to be bitched up

02:30:49.940 --> 02:31:02.500
and the damn table sauce I'll try to keep it short but Ron Charles sent me a

02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:07.220
Christmas card for Christmas obviously and when I received it the envelope had

02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:12.460
been completely opened on three sides by someone else who obviously thought that

02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:19.660
maybe there was games and prizes inside of some sort that F you to that person

02:31:19.660 --> 02:31:24.940
who opened it and F you to my mailman who delivered it to the wrong place

02:31:24.940 --> 02:31:31.620
Loki F you to myself for calling blizzards help line and threatening

02:31:31.620 --> 02:31:37.380
suicide with them oh wait no I didn't do that that's right that's funny no F you

02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:41.860
to not having as much money from my bonuses to waste on stupid shit like

02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:45.740
more airsoft guns instead I did something responsible and actually put

02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:49.020
it into a savings account but it's still pissing me off because I have the urge

02:31:49.020 --> 02:32:00.580
to spend it on useless shit through F you to the card table F you to UPS being

02:32:00.580 --> 02:32:08.820
unnaturally slow and bringing my new mouse or D 9 like 45 bucks last week

02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:34.020

we're gonna open up the skype line for a little bit we'll take a couple calls

02:32:49.700 --> 02:32:53.100
tonight again we ran a little long because the match came so we don't want

02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:55.460
to go on all night long so we still have an afterbirth we got to get to because

02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:59.380
we didn't do it after birth last week is oh boy oh boy just too much going on

02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:02.460
here last hundred stories Oh last minute stories I'm sorry Loki do you have

02:33:02.460 --> 02:33:05.300
something you want to get to yes real quick this is kind of a funny one why

02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:12.380
wait we have EA is branching out into a new field of video games for them at

02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:19.740
least they're tackling the love simulation market with a brand new game

02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:28.420
that's actually a coming out in Japan it's a hot chill koi and it's a game

02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:34.940
that features big-breasted women that you apparently rub tanning lotion on

02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:43.380
nice nice all right let's see we are now on the skype line with a caller hi

02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:48.140
caller who's this hi this is a spazzinator hi spazzinator what's on

02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:55.700
your mind tonight um two things you know two things first of all I'm doing

02:33:55.700 --> 02:34:00.580
something to you I managed to update my you know or you know replace my

02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:07.420
PlayStation 3 it's not exactly the same models I had before but I'll take what I

02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:11.860
can get that's right the ongoing saga of the stolen PlayStation 3 so unfortunately

02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:19.180
it sounds like it was never found so but you got a replacement yeah and now I

02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:26.060
just basically checked out home for the first time you know since I replaced my

02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:30.780
PlayStation 3 and I I don't know you know I didn't know anything about but

02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:35.820
you know what wasn't her supposed to be something in home there basically

02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:41.580
allowed you to go into your like your pocket or whatever bring your friends

02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:46.100
and be able to stream your music or videos and photos and stuff like that

02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:49.900
yeah that was in the early beta but unfortunately it does not look like that

02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:53.660
function has hit the finished product much like half of the other things that

02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:56.540
Sony said was going to be in there such as the trophy cases you're gonna have

02:34:56.540 --> 02:34:59.940
for all the trophies that you get in the games and you know a couple other things

02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:03.700
I think they were probably a little worried as they should be about people

02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:09.620
putting copyright content all over their house but I'll tell you that's the one

02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:13.060
thing that's helping me from getting an OLR clubhouse I would put down the money

02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:17.420
for an OLR clubhouse like that if I could somehow put in like any time like

02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:21.260
even if I could just put like our podcast album art on the wall or

02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:26.300
something cheesy like that I would do it like but I don't I think what they offer

02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:33.460
right now is kind of dopey yeah in a way I can see what they're kind of

02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:39.380
saying is not just for copyright stuff but you know how you know the media and

02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:45.740
sharing other people whose names I won't mention like to get up and up all up in

02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:51.260
arms about you know stupid things you know things now if they had you know

02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:55.940
put the stringing stuff you know functionality to home you know someone

02:35:55.940 --> 02:36:01.340
would've been stupid enough to like stream porn or whatever and then now

02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:06.340
someone will kill see it and all of a sudden you know we'll be fucking off you

02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:13.100
know get into the fire you know give those people ammo to sure us with enough

02:36:13.100 --> 02:36:16.460
well I mean if somebody's gonna do something inappropriate they should just

02:36:16.460 --> 02:36:19.180
simply be banned there should be a really really easy way to report and

02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:22.620
ban those people you know that oh there already should be something set up

02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:25.460
because there's already some craziness going on in home but I'll tell you my

02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:28.460
favorite thing I've discovered to do in home I like to go in the movie theater

02:36:28.460 --> 02:36:31.260
where the previews are playing especially when there's like one preview

02:36:31.260 --> 02:36:34.900
playing over and over and over again and I like to go stand right in the middle

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:40.460
of the screen and dance that's my favorite yeah yeah I've seen people do

02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:44.780
that already yeah it might have been me actually it was a guy wearing a green

02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:47.700
shirt and jeans it was probably me because actually I turned it on on New

02:36:47.700 --> 02:36:50.620
Year's Eve to show some friends what was all about and they wanted me to just

02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:54.980
walk up to random people and start dancing in front of them so I don't know

02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:57.660

9th even though more people are playing them than ps3 yes if you're playing them

02:37:37.140 --> 02:37:40.980

02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:49.260
yes all right and then also Wii Sports is now the best-selling game of all time

02:37:49.260 --> 02:37:54.660

launch radio who's this it's obviously you know who let's just talk to you

02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:03.620
what's up no nothing much just celebrating you're just bringing in the

02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:09.580
new year with mediocrity and just pull just a boring weekend generally yeah how

02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:15.780
did you how did you celebrate what types of games did you play oh for New Year's

02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:21.620
oh that's simple drunken Left 4 Dead after the ball drops nice oh that's one

02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:26.020
of those things like I still or leading up to it but yeah definitely you know

02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:31.420
playing Left 4 Dead in the dark with a with other people while like really

02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:36.420
hammered up I'm worried that game will actually make me shit my pants that's

02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:40.220
what I'm worried about that game it was it's nothing compared to like the other

02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:44.380
classical movies like Dawn of the Dead although I'll be cool they had like a

02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:49.740
mall map for Left 4 Dead either that authentic feeling but besides that it's

02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:53.540
been that's the only excitement I had last week everything else afterwards has

02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:58.660
just been you know ho hum yeah yeah money's tight so I don't have money to

02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:02.300
go out I have might as well stay at home what are you looking forward to what are

02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:09.260
you looking forward to most in 2009 uh well let me see besides digital life

02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:15.060
hopefully coming back other other things you know III being open to the public

02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:19.900
and all hopefully other companies not and not getting the ham not getting the

02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:26.660
axe and generally just damn good games coming out I hope so I hope Sony could

02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:33.020
definitely make it the year of the ps3 unlike the critics who's already already

02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:37.580
said that you know I've already said that sort of thing last year and the

02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:41.300
year before that and they were wrong it's gonna take something big but who

02:39:41.300 --> 02:39:46.780
knows III could be could be this could be this is gonna be a big big year for

02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:51.020
III with you I mean I'm going back in the public special though no I mean yeah

02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:55.160
it's going back to the the circus you can expect that that is gonna be one

02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:00.200
huge thing in 2009 III 2009 is gonna be bigger than any III in the past five

02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:06.140
years okay either play as I you know as a boon for the ESA or it could be

02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:09.860
another big clusterfuck like like the e3s of years past where you had like

02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:14.900
booth babes just a lot of like you know a lot of game devs basically crunching

02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:18.620
for that single demo that they're gonna end they're gonna showcase on e3 so it's

02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:24.860
I don't know whether whether that's what the the effort to actually go back now

02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:29.020
game guru in chat says III will bomb and no one will care we'll see I don't know

02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:33.940
I disagree that's one I mean that's one opinion okay I guess if that person's

02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:37.500
trying to be realistic given the state of the economy unless for some reason

02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:41.700
the economy rebounds over the summer then you'll see a massive circus like

02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:45.460
the like the old ones yeah I think hopefully heck of a circus you'll still

02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:52.340
be alive not like the ones only the last year and the 2007 with just like bombs

02:40:52.340 --> 02:40:57.980
literally ho-hum and just like boring as hell I didn't do nothing to keep it like

02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:03.100
a rigid you know originally as a business expo whereas the old ones

02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:08.540
pretty much you know brought back the hype at the height right there and the

02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:13.780
height you know ended up selling the games well we will we will see what

02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:17.460
develops I don't know why that I'm sorry I'm being distracted by chat room where

02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:22.660
a picture of me pretending to kiss DMN at PAX was posted in chat I don't know

02:41:22.660 --> 02:41:26.140
why that why that happened why did that have to happen I don't know all right

02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:32.820

02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:40.940
in a while that actually haven't worked I mean you guys are just playing the

02:43:40.940 --> 02:43:43.740
match game you're knocking soundboards out the table yeah it's been a pretty

02:43:43.740 --> 02:43:48.500
epic night um what's on your mind hey we had we had we have to ring in 2009 the

02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:53.380
only way we know how exactly not too much well I I hear you didn't like HD

02:43:53.380 --> 02:43:56.780
remix and I know that I'm a little bit late on the draw because you talked

02:43:56.780 --> 02:44:01.700
about issues a couple weeks ago and uh I gotta say I'm pretty much in love with

02:44:01.700 --> 02:44:04.780
the game so I was just calling it a disagree with you a little bit on that

02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:10.180
try to contrast in view you know I just didn't find that there was I don't know

02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:13.180
like Street Fighter 2 is one of those things I find that is better left in my

02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:17.060
memory you know what I mean like it's just not something I think this is and

02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:19.900
I've had time to reflect on what the hell is my big problem with is the game

02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:23.540
anyway and I think honestly what it boils down to is that a lot of my

02:44:23.540 --> 02:44:28.220
problem with the game has boiled down to the shift to Xbox Live and PlayStation

02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:31.700
Network for these games and that it just doesn't have the same magic as it does

02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:35.420
when you actually walk into an arcade and you get to shit talk someone like

02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:40.440
right there in the you know that that's actually standing there next to you

02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:44.180
because people say things online that they would not say to your face that's

02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:48.260
one thing that I'm so I'm quickly learning about Xbox Live as for the game

02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:52.460
itself I I hated the soundtrack that was my like number one bitch about the I know

02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:55.860
I did I and I know they were trying to do the right thing by doing the fan

02:44:55.860 --> 02:44:59.240
remixes and everything and don't even wrong I appreciate the gesture but the

02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:03.140
soundtrack was hideous in my opinion. Oh the remix soundtrack not the original

02:45:03.140 --> 02:45:06.540
soundtrack or do you just hate both? No I love the original. I do love the original

02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:10.460
soundtrack. I don't like the remix one at all I don't like the remix one at all and

02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:15.220
then I don't know that it just it just left me wanting more I felt like instead

02:45:15.220 --> 02:45:18.500
of just kind of replacing the sprites it was going to be smoother but then I

02:45:18.500 --> 02:45:24.140
realized I'm thinking of Street Fighter 4. I am desperately looking forward to

02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:26.820
Street Fighter 4 as well I mean it's actually coming out on my birthday which

02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:32.100
is kind of odd. Oh nice. Yeah I the thing is is that I like what Capcom did I do I

02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:34.780
think it's great that they actually did go to the fans for the remixes which I

02:45:34.780 --> 02:45:37.340
can understand why they'd be a little bit subjective especially if you liked

02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:41.820
you know the the sound of the original songs and all. I did I really did like

02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:46.660
the originals. It's great that Capcom actually did go to the guys at GGPO and

02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:50.460
actually got their help with the netcode I mean the multiplayer for Street Fighter

02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:54.460
2 is I don't want to call it flawless because there are a couple problems I

02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:58.220
mean even then lag does pop up occasionally but I never thought they'd

02:45:58.220 --> 02:46:02.780
actually be able to get a fighting game this good online and just actually seeing

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:06.060
this actually being able to play you know totient up in Canada or being able

02:46:06.060 --> 02:46:11.820
to play even Shadow's Wire across in the UK with no lag or very negligible lag is

02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:16.460
it blows my mind frankly. It's like I'm literally playing them in the arcade

02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:20.620
right uh right next to them as far as the lag goes. Maybe I need to play

02:46:20.620 --> 02:46:25.140
against more like real people I know and not random people because I played this

02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:27.020
all at a friend's house because I actually don't even own the game I

02:46:27.020 --> 02:46:31.700
actually played on PlayStation 3 so but yeah it's just I don't know and oh god

02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:36.340
the Xbox 360 controller still is such an issue like I feel like if I did get the

02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:39.260
game I'd have to get it on PlayStation 3 and even then I don't I don't know a lot

02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:44.420
of people on there. Yeah I've been enjoying actually playing a few people

02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:47.700
from the all-games community in the OLR community over an HD remix so that

02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:51.300
hasn't been so much of a problem for me. It's been a learning curve to actually

02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:55.900
get used to the controller the d-pad is leaving calluses on my thumbs frankly

02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:58.740
and I've had to use the control stick for anyone who's not a Shotokan

02:46:58.740 --> 02:47:03.220
character. Do we have a lot of OLR people that play Left 4 Dead on PC? I know

02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:05.740
this is a completely random topic but I'm kind of curious because I'm actually

02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:09.900
thinking about getting Left 4 Dead but on PC not uh not 360 just because I

02:47:09.900 --> 02:47:13.660
first-person shooters I think I could do better on PC than I can on the 360. I

02:47:13.660 --> 02:47:17.540
just want to throw that out there. What you can do is join the Steam community

02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:20.780
Orange Launch Radio does have a Steam community. Is there actually people that

02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:25.020
are still using it? Yeah I'm on it. Interesting all right maybe I'll have to

02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:27.100
play Left 4 Dead sometime because I think I'm gonna pick that up sooner

02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:31.140
than later. So anyway sorry didn't mean to didn't mean to just rail what Rob D

02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:34.460
had originally called in about. Yeah you know I noticed the fighting game fans

02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:37.660
especially really are in love with HD remakes and maybe I didn't give it a

02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:41.440
fair look but I don't know it just didn't it didn't it didn't resonate the

02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:44.980
way with me that it did the rest of you. I guess maybe my I was just so hyped up

02:47:44.980 --> 02:47:48.460
for it to be this like new and something like so different but it was just kind

02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:52.580
of like I don't know like it just felt like a letdown to me I it's hard to

02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:55.460
explain. I'm looking forward to Street Fighter 4 as well and if they actually

02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:58.140
get the netcode half as good on that game as they did in Street Fighter HD

02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:01.380
remakes I'll be happy so. I will say that I'm definitely looking forward to Street

02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:04.340
Fighter 4 as well I will definitely pick that up when it comes out so we will

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:07.340
have that to battle on if nothing else. And nothing will match the magic of

02:48:07.340 --> 02:48:11.300
actually playing someone in an arcade right next to them you know the

02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:14.980
shadiness of the arcade aside because let's face it not some some arcades

02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:20.220
are better left to our memories rather than to our current sense of

02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:25.300
smell today. Yeah good point good point. All right well Rob D I gotta let you

02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:28.660
go so we wrap up the show but thank you so much for your call and have fun

02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:32.500
battling the fellow listeners online. That's great to do. Act after you're going

02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:36.860
down. See you later. Later. I guess they're already setting up a battle after the

02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:39.520
show. That's one of the great things about doing a radio show like Orange

02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:43.220
Lounge Radio. So you know we are moving into 2009 which if you can believe it

02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:48.540
we started this show in 2002 so now this is our seventh year of broadcasting if

02:48:48.540 --> 02:48:53.140
you can believe it and it's really neat to see the community that's kind of

02:48:53.140 --> 02:48:56.380
built up and that people kind of do this stuff that makes it what we do here like

02:48:56.380 --> 02:49:02.940
so worthwhile. Car tables being knocked over and all. Speaking of which yes got a

02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:06.460
message from Rama with all the people who chipped in on that whiteboard for

02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:11.260
you guys. Yes I I was seeing some stuff in chat what is going on I thought that

02:49:11.260 --> 02:49:15.420
this was just something Rama got from his connections or something that is

02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:21.900
work. We pooled our money together. Shut up. Me, Rama, Misty, SSJ 100 Matt, and Alpha

02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:26.300
Kinanagram all pitched in to get you the whiteboard. That is so awesome. Well

02:49:26.300 --> 02:49:30.780
thank you guys so much for that. That is great. I hope you get some use out of it.

02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:33.700
We will. Well I'm probably gonna do I'm probably gonna rearrange this. We're

02:49:33.700 --> 02:49:37.540
gonna have a week down. I'm gonna be on vacation so not only am I going you know

02:49:37.540 --> 02:49:41.340
off out of the state for a few days but I'm gonna be just taking a couple extra

02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:44.340
days off work. I'm probably gonna try and rearrange some things in here so probably

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:47.140
what I'm gonna do instead of hanging the whiteboard up I'll probably move all

02:49:47.140 --> 02:49:50.020
these stuffed animals you see back here and have the whiteboard resting there

02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:53.900
and move some things around so that way it's easily accessible too and that the

02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:57.100
whiteboard won't get knocked over if I do try to mount it so but we will

02:49:57.100 --> 02:49:59.420
definitely make use out of it and that'll be something fun for the Justin

02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:03.120
TV listeners because hopefully we will have a webcam when we come back in two

02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:06.900
weeks here on this show so it's almost like a whole new show not really though

02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:11.980
just some new toys some new toys for an old and aging and practically dead show

02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:18.380
hey like Benny Hill right we're old and dead all right all right so hopefully

02:50:18.380 --> 02:50:23.740
