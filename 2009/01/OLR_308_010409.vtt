WEBVTT

00:13.797 --> 00:21.297
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, January 4th, 2009, Xbox avatars get dressed for a rave, is Rock Band getting a LEGO themed expansion?

00:32.349 --> 00:32.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Snorelax Hey Hey

01:01.997 --> 01:02.698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing okay.

01:03.038 --> 01:05.881
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was having a conversation about Pokemon and WoW the other day.

01:05.961 --> 01:06.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ask.

01:06.822 --> 01:08.703
[SPEAKER_03]: But have you ever seen the Pokemon Jinx?

01:10.165 --> 01:10.845
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:11.085 --> 01:12.847
[SPEAKER_03]: Jinx looks like a giant drag queen.

01:12.987 --> 01:13.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Google it.

01:13.608 --> 01:15.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Google Jinx Pokemon.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.

01:16.831 --> 01:17.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.673
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely random like the rest of the show.

01:20.294 --> 01:23.377
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to our very own drag queen here in studio, Tech Master Loki.

01:23.557 --> 01:24.057
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.739
[SPEAKER_04]: You must be talking about Andrew right here.

01:27.920 --> 01:35.182
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I was just imagining you dressed as Tingle because it's seemingly never going to happen, so I just have to imagine it.

01:36.483 --> 01:36.863
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

01:37.443 --> 01:38.323
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing fine.

01:38.383 --> 01:40.924
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be better if this would work correctly.

01:41.964 --> 01:43.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I forgot you have a cam over there.

01:43.545 --> 01:45.685
[SPEAKER_03]: God, pointed at my worst possible angle.

01:45.705 --> 01:46.305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not working.

01:46.485 --> 01:47.225
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's good.

01:47.966 --> 01:49.786
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the ladies on the couch like to be filmed anyway.

01:49.806 --> 01:49.986
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

01:53.072 --> 01:53.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you?

01:53.572 --> 01:54.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad, not bad.

02:16.735 --> 02:17.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, cool.

02:17.495 --> 02:18.536
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your new year?

02:19.556 --> 02:20.157
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty quiet.

02:21.037 --> 02:21.637
[SPEAKER_13]: Champagne.

02:21.697 --> 02:24.779
[SPEAKER_13]: Got to see how Dick Clark's progressed.

02:25.239 --> 02:25.939
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not good.

02:26.599 --> 02:27.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Not good, apparently.

02:27.660 --> 02:28.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Prognosis?

02:28.160 --> 02:28.800
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little sad about that.

02:28.820 --> 02:29.240
[SPEAKER_03]: You old.

02:30.461 --> 02:30.821
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:31.321 --> 02:31.662
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:32.122 --> 02:43.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us tonight, all the way from the city that never sleeps, Las Vegas, say hello to Tiara, also known as Sauce.

02:44.226 --> 02:44.666
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

02:44.866 --> 02:45.547
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, Sauce?

02:45.807 --> 02:46.628
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing pretty good.

02:46.908 --> 02:47.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

02:47.869 --> 02:48.729
[SPEAKER_03]: How's Vegas?

02:49.410 --> 02:50.811
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Vegas-like.

02:51.111 --> 02:53.953
[SPEAKER_07]: It snowed a couple of weeks ago, and everybody freaked out.

02:54.453 --> 02:56.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it doesn't snow in the desert like ever.

02:56.254 --> 02:56.755
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun times.

02:57.035 --> 02:59.516
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you're spending the week in Sacramento?

02:59.957 --> 03:01.498
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is actually my last night here.

03:01.518 --> 03:02.138
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

03:02.198 --> 03:03.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how was your New Year's?

03:03.659 --> 03:04.160
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.001
[SPEAKER_07]: We played a lot of rock band.

03:06.348 --> 03:07.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good times.

03:07.850 --> 03:10.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're at a website now where you talk about all sorts of nerdy things.

03:11.273 --> 03:13.115
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually have something to plug tonight.

03:13.175 --> 03:14.296
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you plug away?

03:14.987 --> 03:21.611
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have a game slash comic slash book slash other geeky nerdy stuff.

03:21.631 --> 03:22.451
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nerd blog.

03:22.551 --> 03:23.211
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a total nerd.

03:23.331 --> 03:24.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything nerdy, it's there.

03:24.712 --> 03:25.012
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.454
[SPEAKER_07]: It's avengerstower.com.

03:27.514 --> 03:34.077
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, Jamie made an account on there, too, and she's posted a review on some comics.

03:34.737 --> 03:39.880
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just kind of a fun place for all of your nerdy stuff to kind of converge together and...

03:40.300 --> 03:48.603
[SPEAKER_07]: You will probably occasionally see references to that one episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where... Nice, very nice.

03:48.623 --> 03:49.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, best of luck with the blog.

03:49.803 --> 03:56.886
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to see, you know, two cute nerdy girls giggling and screaming about comics and things... No, I'm just kidding.

03:57.626 --> 03:58.166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun read.

03:58.206 --> 03:59.167
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are very good writers.

03:59.227 --> 04:00.267
[SPEAKER_03]: So, good luck with that.

04:00.547 --> 04:03.608
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably even better than OrangeNotesRadio.com, so definitely check it out.

04:04.069 --> 04:04.349
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

04:05.609 --> 04:07.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off with how was your gaming week?

04:07.431 --> 04:16.178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura, since you're all big time writing for a big Giggling Girl blog now, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

04:16.298 --> 04:17.159
[SPEAKER_03]: Giggling Geek Girl.

04:17.660 --> 04:18.080
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

04:18.100 --> 04:18.841
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

04:18.881 --> 04:18.981
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

04:19.734 --> 04:31.139
[SPEAKER_05]: I played, of course, Rock Band on New Year's Eve in that crappy Lips game that was full of crap and crappiness and songs that I hate.

04:33.080 --> 04:37.462
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I would have thought Lips was awesome because it's by the Elite Beat Agents people, but you were not a fan.

04:37.562 --> 04:40.023
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a bunch of pop bullshit that I hate.

04:41.468 --> 04:51.856
[SPEAKER_05]: as in when I went in the room and had to ask what is this and who is that then that's a sign that it's stuff that I don't listen to um

04:54.301 --> 04:57.623
[SPEAKER_05]: You made me play Seeing Star ABBA today.

04:58.023 --> 04:58.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was amazing.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.065
[SPEAKER_03]: The girls came over before tonight's show.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.986
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat down with some Seeing Star ABBA.

05:03.626 --> 05:06.188
[SPEAKER_03]: It was epic, as ABBA would be.

05:06.488 --> 05:11.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here's the thing about DarkSakura, though, is that she does this whole, like, you know, oh, I don't sing in front of people.

05:11.651 --> 05:12.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to sing.

05:12.411 --> 05:13.252
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really want to play.

05:13.652 --> 05:14.172
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know...

05:15.513 --> 05:16.393
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

05:45.146 --> 05:46.847
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's okay, okay, okay.

05:46.987 --> 05:49.268
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the thing, and I'm sure I've explained this before.

05:49.648 --> 05:54.069
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate hearing out of tune, and I hear myself out of tune, and it drives me nuts.

05:54.649 --> 05:59.851
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think everyone else can hear it, because I hear it, so I don't really want to do it.

05:59.991 --> 06:04.313
[SPEAKER_05]: And singing in front of people has been ruined for me forever because of church choir.

06:05.450 --> 06:05.750
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

06:06.171 --> 06:09.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so that explains then why we're shy.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.535
[SPEAKER_03]: And at least you can change the mic volume.

06:11.935 --> 06:13.116
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was helpful.

06:13.136 --> 06:15.318
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just because I didn't want to hear myself that loud.

06:16.759 --> 06:17.680
[SPEAKER_05]: But I played other stuff.

06:17.820 --> 06:20.182
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually turned on Order of Ecclesia and then turned it off.

06:20.962 --> 06:22.663
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was when Becky arrived.

06:22.683 --> 06:26.707
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was just starting to play and then was like, oh, hi.

06:27.127 --> 06:28.248
[SPEAKER_05]: So we watched Eddie Izzard.

06:28.988 --> 06:32.931
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we played a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

06:33.872 --> 06:35.013
[SPEAKER_05]: and buy a whole crap ton.

06:35.113 --> 06:36.833
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean a whole crap ton.

06:37.514 --> 06:38.474
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fantastic.

06:39.014 --> 06:39.314
[SPEAKER_05]: Four.

06:40.735 --> 06:41.055
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

06:45.557 --> 06:46.577
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell else did I play?

06:48.118 --> 06:50.799
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta go to chat room because leave it to chat room to make some

06:51.279 --> 07:02.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Teehee type comments, chat.orangelandre.com, the ever-present extra guest on the program, Blackwolf, our buddy, who is on right before us at allgames.com, and I should work in this plug for him.

07:03.064 --> 07:05.525
[SPEAKER_03]: He's starting a new project next week on Friday.

07:05.585 --> 07:08.906
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Friday Night Gaming, FNG, that effing show.

07:09.006 --> 07:11.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I can actually call it that effing show, and he can't get mad at me.

07:11.848 --> 07:12.348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's FNG.

07:13.428 --> 07:35.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Fnglive.net and he has a comment tonight he says the game obviously didn't hear you sing out of tune because that's right you got a high score obviously you weren't out of tune because the game didn't grade you out of tune just had to say that okay but it's it's probably forgiving so she has another reason to be self-deprecating I want ice cream now anyway

07:35.990 --> 07:36.731
[SPEAKER_13]: I played something else.

07:36.751 --> 07:36.911
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah!

07:36.931 --> 07:37.371
[SPEAKER_13]: Big Buck Safari.

07:37.471 --> 07:37.571
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

08:07.091 --> 08:10.994
[SPEAKER_05]: We were waiting on our food at the Beach Hut Deli.

08:12.735 --> 08:14.517
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're great.

08:14.657 --> 08:19.340
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up on Madison out there, on Greenback, wherever.

08:19.861 --> 08:24.404
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, we were waiting on our food and I was like, I want to shoot an elephant!

08:25.705 --> 08:27.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was the tropical one.

08:30.372 --> 08:33.794
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got up there, and thank you for the 50 cents, by the way.

08:36.454 --> 08:39.415
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't shoot elephants to start, so I picked a wildebeest.

08:40.256 --> 08:42.296
[SPEAKER_05]: And kept wanting to shoot the wildebeest.

08:42.697 --> 08:47.618
[SPEAKER_05]: But they were stupid, and it's like, if you shoot, you can only shoot the buck, you can't shoot the cow.

08:48.058 --> 08:49.219
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, you shot a cow!

08:50.039 --> 08:50.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Moo.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.680
[SPEAKER_05]: But I shot a lion in the ass.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.148
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

09:10.947 --> 09:16.349
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to remind people that all these Safari games we play, they're all crap compared to Jumbo Safari, honestly.

09:16.449 --> 09:18.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Jumbo Safari is great.

09:18.449 --> 09:23.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumbo Safari is one of those amazing, great games that we'll never shut up about here on Orange Lounge Radio.

09:23.531 --> 09:27.172
[SPEAKER_03]: File it under Guardian Legend and SingStar ABBA because it's right up there.

09:28.345 --> 09:36.551
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, I, I, our Turbo Express is low on battery and we need new batteries for it, but I really wanted to play R-Type on, uh, earlier in the week.

09:37.492 --> 09:48.840
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get to play R-Type, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, I did get, I told you I got Katamari for my iPhone and I played some.

09:49.921 --> 09:53.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it as fail-tastic as a lot of people were saying or did they really fix it?

09:53.123 --> 09:54.044
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard they fixed some stuff.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.821
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still kind of hard to control.

09:55.881 --> 09:57.001
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done story mode yet.

09:57.021 --> 10:00.082
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just been doing endless to get used to the controls.

10:00.822 --> 10:01.723
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like tilting it.

10:01.763 --> 10:08.285
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish that I could just, you know, slide my thumb in one direction and have the Katamari go that way.

10:08.425 --> 10:09.306
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's alright.

10:09.346 --> 10:09.746
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not bad.

10:11.364 --> 10:19.226
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually, I can't really notice a lot of the frame rate problems that people were talking about because the first one kind of had a few of those on its own.

10:20.027 --> 10:22.227
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really isn't all that big of a deal.

10:22.307 --> 10:23.368
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an iPhone app.

10:23.708 --> 10:24.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Deal with it.

10:24.668 --> 10:24.988
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit.

10:26.148 --> 10:29.049
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you want to play Katamari that doesn't have that problem?

10:29.429 --> 10:30.530
[SPEAKER_05]: Freaking get a PS2.

10:33.971 --> 10:35.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I like that review.

10:36.231 --> 10:37.132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an iPhone app.

10:37.192 --> 10:37.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.

10:37.712 --> 10:38.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Deal with it.

10:38.172 --> 10:38.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.822
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to type that up right now.

10:43.763 --> 10:44.123
[SPEAKER_03]: You do that.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that in the Giggling Girl blog.

10:45.905 --> 10:46.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

10:46.846 --> 10:47.186
[SPEAKER_03]: I should.

10:48.187 --> 10:49.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on over to Loki.

10:49.429 --> 10:50.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

10:51.531 --> 10:52.632
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was okay.

10:55.024 --> 11:09.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried playing some Grand Theft Auto on PC, Grand Theft Auto 4, and for some reason, you know, I was trying to get some of the mods to work, and it just doesn't like doing mods or something.

11:09.334 --> 11:13.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I'm not really changing much, it's just being retarded, so that's kind of annoying.

11:13.237 --> 11:19.381
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did get some of the no-gravity stuff to work, but I was trying to do some really fun stuff with it, but oh well.

11:20.021 --> 11:22.183
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know,

11:22.915 --> 11:29.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto 4 on the 360 as well, still playing our bi-daily games.

11:30.518 --> 11:34.399
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually tried some new XNA games.

11:35.039 --> 11:38.300
[SPEAKER_04]: One, though, I really liked was Carnivale.

11:39.001 --> 11:45.183
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember the rest of the title for that, but Carnivale, it's a really weird...

11:46.127 --> 11:46.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Carneyvale Showtime

12:05.356 --> 12:06.418
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sorry, never mind.

12:06.578 --> 12:07.580
[SPEAKER_04]: Except they are really balloons.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

12:08.883 --> 12:17.318
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but you actually, they have these little devices that swing you around stuff, and the whole goal of it is to pop all the balloons and get up to the top of the screen where there's a flaming ring.

12:18.442 --> 12:19.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

12:42.762 --> 12:44.523
[SPEAKER_04]: So highly recommend you check it out.

12:44.703 --> 12:46.744
[SPEAKER_04]: I went ahead and purchased it because it was awesome.

12:46.884 --> 12:49.786
[SPEAKER_04]: So check it out and buy it because it's good.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.108
[SPEAKER_04]: And very fun, actually, and really colorful.

12:53.608 --> 12:56.810
[SPEAKER_03]: So for all those people out there that say you hate on community games, not true.

12:57.030 --> 13:00.472
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is what I'm saying is they need to be polished.

13:00.932 --> 13:05.415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because a lot of the stuff I see on there is not very polished, and that's my problem with it.

13:06.161 --> 13:11.343
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so you have to look at games like this and go, oh my god, this is what they could be like.

13:11.383 --> 13:13.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what the hell is everyone else doing?

13:13.404 --> 13:14.505
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my thing right there.

13:15.325 --> 13:19.947
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPower in chat says, every time somebody talks about a carnival, I think about that Carnival arcade game.

13:20.268 --> 13:23.109
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, when you said Carnivale, I was thinking of that HBO series.

13:23.449 --> 13:23.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Carnival?

13:24.069 --> 13:26.090
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they make a Carnival video game?

13:26.511 --> 13:27.851
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not a Carnival video game.

13:28.171 --> 13:29.032
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's really cool though.

13:29.092 --> 13:34.194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easily something though that could be an Xbox Live arcade game.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.915
[SPEAKER_04]: Which it should be, I think, but

13:36.496 --> 13:37.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

13:38.677 --> 13:46.240
[SPEAKER_04]: And then other than that, I played a little bit of Dissidia and a little bit of Animal Crossing.

13:47.340 --> 13:49.461
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much it.

13:49.601 --> 13:54.243
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to try to play some other things this week, but I didn't get around to it.

13:54.883 --> 13:55.363
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's okay.

13:56.824 --> 13:58.585
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week, you know, same old stuff.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.306
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft.

14:00.526 --> 14:03.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I've now done three wings on 25-man Naxx.

14:03.027 --> 14:03.528
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

14:04.168 --> 14:05.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of our raiding alliance.

14:05.669 --> 14:05.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

14:06.989 --> 14:07.410
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was fun.

14:08.310 --> 14:09.011
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.

14:09.111 --> 14:13.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, you know what game I've actually been spending the majority of my game week playing?

14:13.813 --> 14:15.014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Seekoden.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the old school PlayStation 1 game, Suikoden.

14:18.838 --> 14:20.860
[SPEAKER_03]: And why have I been playing that of all games?

14:20.940 --> 14:29.390
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they released it on the PlayStation 3, I think two weeks ago, I think Christmas week, as one of the backwards compatible games that you can play on your PlayStation 3 or the PSP.

14:29.850 --> 14:31.833
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of a hard to find game now.

14:32.273 --> 14:34.656
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a collector's item for a little while.

14:34.796 --> 14:34.996
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

14:36.017 --> 14:38.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that it's on PlayStation 3, I'm not sure how that's going to go.

14:38.420 --> 14:43.725
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the hardcore collectors will still be after it, but those that want to play it now can do so for $6.

14:44.565 --> 14:47.668
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool, because I remember playing the game once a long time ago.

14:47.708 --> 14:51.112
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd rented it, but I didn't really remember it.

14:51.152 --> 14:53.113
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my really good friends has been on the show before, Shane.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.436
[SPEAKER_03]: He always raves about Suikoden.

14:55.496 --> 14:58.218
[SPEAKER_03]: I just knew that a lot of people really liked the game, so I wanted to play it.

14:58.739 --> 14:58.899
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

15:00.220 --> 15:01.021
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:21.380 --> 15:22.181
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got past it.

15:22.541 --> 15:24.002
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, did that take persistence.

15:24.322 --> 15:30.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, there's a boss that's a giant roulette wheel and you step onto it and you land on a square that might be a monster or might be experience.

15:31.186 --> 15:34.368
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're waiting to land on the square that'll take you to the next room.

15:34.408 --> 15:36.469
[SPEAKER_03]: But you might have to do the damn thing like 50 times.

15:36.489 --> 15:37.110
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even kidding.

15:37.250 --> 15:37.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Fox did it.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.171
[SPEAKER_03]: All these random videos.

15:39.872 --> 15:40.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrible.

15:41.394 --> 15:43.335
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, the game's pretty awesome, actually.

15:43.576 --> 15:49.200
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the concept of going around and recruiting people to join your army, because there should be an army of supporters that I have.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so that was pretty much my gaming week.

15:52.842 --> 15:53.663
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good classic.

15:53.683 --> 15:54.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet code.

15:55.124 --> 15:56.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, how was your gaming week?

15:58.011 --> 15:58.451
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty good.

15:58.471 --> 16:00.172
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a cold for most of the week.

16:00.753 --> 16:01.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.

16:01.673 --> 16:03.494
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of ruined my week too.

16:04.315 --> 16:07.997
[SPEAKER_13]: I sat and played World of Warcraft.

16:08.557 --> 16:10.038
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm actually a main tank now.

16:10.478 --> 16:11.719
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the tanks for my guild.

16:14.361 --> 16:35.436
[SPEAKER_13]: I took advantage of the Steam sale that happened at the end of the year, picked up some games, finally got Portal, finally played through Portal, I mean 5 bucks, come on, played through Bioshock, got Team Fortress 2, played that a little bit, Enemy Territory Quake Wars, and I'm just starting out on Fallout 3.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.459
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've been a little busy gaming wise, but it's all been good.

16:40.100 --> 16:45.202
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Fallout 3 has been one of those games that I want to play eventually, because I've heard so many good things about it.

16:45.262 --> 16:49.944
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play Oblivion until a few months after it was out, and I still loved it later, just thinking of Bethesda games.

16:50.565 --> 16:55.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Fallout 3 seeming to be worthy of all the praise that's been lavished upon it by the gaming masses?

16:56.087 --> 17:01.109
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll preface this with the fact that I hate Oblivion, but I like Fallout 3.

17:01.529 --> 17:02.370
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a damn good game.

17:04.793 --> 17:10.375
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little tedious to walk this place and that until you get to fast travel back and forth.

17:11.576 --> 17:16.137
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's pretty good for first-person style Fallout.

17:16.798 --> 17:20.719
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of miss the holy turn-based thing, but VATS takes care of that quite nicely.

17:22.620 --> 17:22.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

17:23.820 --> 17:25.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

17:26.982 --> 17:27.522
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about it.

17:28.062 --> 17:29.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then let's move on over to Sauce.

17:30.263 --> 17:30.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Sauce.

17:31.103 --> 17:31.443
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

17:31.744 --> 17:32.584
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

17:32.604 --> 17:32.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

17:32.975 --> 17:33.635
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good.

17:34.215 --> 17:39.676
[SPEAKER_07]: Earlier in the week, I played a lot of Eternal Sonata, which was... We're having mic issues.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.737
[SPEAKER_03]: If you heard that... No, I don't think it was you.

17:41.777 --> 17:44.557
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was... One of these mics is on the fritz.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on its last legs.

17:45.818 --> 17:47.118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one I told Andrew to use.

17:47.398 --> 17:47.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it?

17:48.238 --> 17:51.539
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that makes... Yeah, I think that mic is going to go any day now.

17:51.599 --> 17:52.739
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sorry.

17:52.779 --> 17:54.819
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hear random things, sorry about that.

17:54.899 --> 17:55.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio.

17:55.900 --> 17:56.600
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks sometimes.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Sauce.

17:58.174 --> 18:00.376
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Eternal Sonata, which is fun.

18:00.576 --> 18:10.764
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got an Xbox 360 the day after Thanksgiving, so I'm kind of catching up on games that people have already played before.

18:11.205 --> 18:11.905
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was fun.

18:13.146 --> 18:16.809
[SPEAKER_07]: And then New Year's Eve, we played a lot of Rock Band.

18:16.949 --> 18:23.494
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Lips, which I thought was pretty cool, because there's a lot of poppy music that Jamie hates, but I thought it was great.

18:24.375 --> 18:24.475
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

18:25.976 --> 18:30.646
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was fun.

18:31.769 --> 18:35.597
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith with Dan, which was also fun.

18:35.637 --> 18:36.339
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that game.

18:38.304 --> 18:50.393
[SPEAKER_07]: and I wound up waking up like five hours before Jamie or Dan did on New Year's Day so I wound up trying out Fable 2 because I'd never played that and I'm really addicted.

18:50.433 --> 18:58.860
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been waking up before everyone almost every day since I've been here and I've been playing that in the mornings and I accidentally killed my first husband.

18:59.580 --> 19:00.781
[SPEAKER_07]: which was fun.

19:01.241 --> 19:01.581
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

19:02.542 --> 19:16.769
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot he was following me and I went to go do a quest to kill bandits and I accidentally got him killed so then I remarried and then I moved into a nicer house and then in the gypsy camp I found a lesbian who was in love with me so I married her also.

19:18.730 --> 19:22.252
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got a bigamist achievement for that so it was fun.

19:22.573 --> 19:23.013
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

19:26.815 --> 19:28.876
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that was pretty much my gaming week.

19:29.494 --> 19:30.114
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll see you next time.

19:47.870 --> 19:48.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, anyhow.

19:50.631 --> 19:55.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on talking about some podcast updates and the show.

19:56.413 --> 19:57.833
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no show next week.

19:57.873 --> 20:01.655
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a reminder, we will not be here live next week, January 11th.

20:02.515 --> 20:04.296
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we're on vacation.

20:04.376 --> 20:08.937
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be out of the state, and I think everybody else just wants a week off after the holidays.

20:09.017 --> 20:11.098
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy your night off from OLR.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.239
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be back, however, on the 18th.

20:31.687 --> 20:41.792
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, let's get into tonight's news and stuff, and we'll get into a game later on, which some of our chatters can play, and possibly win a fabulous prize.

20:42.112 --> 20:43.173
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk more about that later.

20:43.893 --> 20:45.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?

20:46.094 --> 20:47.755
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well guess what?

20:48.996 --> 20:58.740
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nielsen Company has done a bunch of different polls, and one of those polls that they have tabulated was, what was the most played game console for 2008?

21:01.072 --> 21:02.433
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, congratulations, Sony.

21:02.573 --> 21:04.095
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the PlayStation 2.

21:05.896 --> 21:15.004
[SPEAKER_04]: And that had 31.2% of the market share, which is not surprising because it still has the largest market share of game consoles out there right now.

21:16.185 --> 21:26.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two was the Xbox 360 with 17.2%, followed by the Wii with 13.4%, which is interesting because there are more Wii consoles out there.

21:27.728 --> 21:29.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360,

21:50.798 --> 21:51.018
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.

21:52.139 --> 21:52.920
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

21:53.901 --> 21:55.962
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, GameCube with 4.6%.

21:56.322 --> 21:59.165
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey, at least they're beating the GameCube.

22:02.567 --> 22:04.529
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed handhelds aren't ranked in there, though.

22:05.970 --> 22:11.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I think they're talking about home console and, you know, I don't know.

22:11.294 --> 22:13.195
[SPEAKER_04]: They just didn't consider handhelds, I guess.

22:14.326 --> 22:18.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you talk about handhelds, then you've got to do the iPhone, maybe.

22:19.475 --> 22:21.438
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just ignore the handhelds.

22:22.688 --> 22:27.150
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, do you think things might change in 2009?

22:27.590 --> 22:30.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think at some point something's got to overtake the PlayStation 2 eventually?

22:30.731 --> 22:32.811
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of surprised the Wii wasn't higher up there.

22:32.831 --> 22:34.012
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I am and I'm not.

22:34.452 --> 22:40.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the Wii's biggest problem is that once the novelty of Wii Sports and all that wears off, it kind of just sits there and gathers dust.

22:40.714 --> 22:47.196
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, there's still a lot of families, especially at Christmas time, that are all playing Wii Sports together and stuff, you know?

22:47.957 --> 22:49.277
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know,

22:50.458 --> 22:55.481
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you rather be, I mean, would people be playing Wii Sports for like six hours a day?

22:55.741 --> 23:00.004
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's some people, obviously, they'll play more hardcore like RPGs and stuff like that.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Fallout, you know.

23:03.566 --> 23:07.749
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Fallout, they could be playing that for hours at a time and that just kind of goes right by.

23:07.809 --> 23:11.432
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Wii doesn't really have anything that takes up tons of time.

23:12.192 --> 23:15.274
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Animal Crossing, but hell, that gets boring after a couple hours, so.

23:17.435 --> 23:19.777
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really that big of a surprise.

23:21.345 --> 23:26.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess all those people that are playing Wii Fit or not playing Wii Fit or not playing Wii Music.

23:27.829 --> 23:28.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Very funny.

23:33.633 --> 23:36.595
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob has escaped us.

23:36.695 --> 23:38.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, live radio folks.

23:38.937 --> 23:45.722
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to go fix the network by plugging in the extender, which I had unplugged earlier in the week because it was causing me issues with the PlayStation 3.

23:48.350 --> 23:52.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, 2009, not off to a good start in regards to technical difficulties, is it?

23:52.353 --> 23:53.975
[SPEAKER_03]: We have mic issues and network issues.

23:54.656 --> 23:55.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Good lord.

23:55.777 --> 24:03.544
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, but one thing that's not having issues, it's growing and growing, is XNA and the community games on Xbox Live Marketplace.

24:03.844 --> 24:05.746
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you laughing about over there, Sauce?

24:06.266 --> 24:07.647
[SPEAKER_03]: My lame transitions or what?

24:08.388 --> 24:08.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

24:08.728 --> 24:09.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

24:10.842 --> 24:19.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, hey, obviously there are just tons and tons and tons of games on the community games list, and it's kind of hard to figure out what is good and out there to download.

24:19.628 --> 24:27.773
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, obviously there's a lot of good stuff out there, but there's some also not good stuff out there, so trying to be able to sort it all can be a challenge.

24:28.194 --> 24:34.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this website, Gamerbytes.com, actually decided to put together their top 10 XNA community games of 2008.

24:35.859 --> 24:38.360
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from Gamerbytes.com.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.222
[SPEAKER_03]: They say GalaxEmail.

24:41.182 --> 24:44.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Monaco 360, which looks a little bit like Rally X to me.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.324
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about that.

24:45.644 --> 24:47.025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a remake of Monaco.

24:47.045 --> 24:48.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a remake of Monaco GP.

24:49.206 --> 24:50.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

24:50.386 --> 24:52.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Cave-In was eight.

24:52.807 --> 24:53.908
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Pilot was seven.

24:53.968 --> 24:55.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Weapon of Choice was six.

24:55.568 --> 24:57.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Hexothermic was five.

24:57.689 --> 24:58.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Duo Tricks was four.

24:59.430 --> 25:01.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnny Platform's Biscuit Romp was three.

25:01.751 --> 25:03.212
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost downloaded that today.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.052
[SPEAKER_05]: Biscuit Romp?

25:04.452 --> 25:05.553
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultratron Ultratron Ultratron

25:29.790 --> 25:34.891
[SPEAKER_03]: How sad, though, that our buddy Aaron and his game Snake360 did not make the list, but maybe next year.

25:34.971 --> 25:35.592
[SPEAKER_03]: He must have been number 11.

25:36.452 --> 25:36.772
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

25:37.312 --> 25:37.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe next year.

25:38.172 --> 25:48.455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunate because there's probably so many games out there right now, and there's nothing really to... I mean, you can look at the top downloads and stuff like that, but it's kind of skewed sometimes.

25:49.015 --> 25:49.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

25:49.115 --> 25:49.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

25:50.546 --> 25:50.866
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

25:50.886 --> 25:51.527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it can be.

25:52.007 --> 25:56.429
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if anybody's figured out a way to kind of like stack the deck.

25:57.070 --> 25:57.630
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

25:57.670 --> 26:00.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if somebody's figured out a way to cheat that system yet or anything like that.

26:01.032 --> 26:02.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Download the trial a bunch of times?

26:02.492 --> 26:02.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

26:04.293 --> 26:06.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it would require unique accounts or what?

26:07.455 --> 26:07.775
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

26:07.875 --> 26:08.196
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

26:09.116 --> 26:15.199
[SPEAKER_04]: But Jamie, that one game, the Biscuit Challenge or whatever, that's only 200 Microsoft points to download.

26:15.439 --> 26:17.180
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks kind of like a neat little platformer game.

26:17.541 --> 26:19.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'll have to invest and challenge the biscuits.

26:20.506 --> 26:22.147
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear that, Fireplace Sim?

26:22.727 --> 26:23.867
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 Microsoft points.

26:24.407 --> 26:25.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't need to be 500.

26:25.808 --> 26:28.789
[SPEAKER_04]: That's ridiculous for stupid, fake-looking fire.

26:30.129 --> 26:30.429
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

26:31.509 --> 26:33.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll have to check some of these out.

26:33.970 --> 26:39.012
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been falling behind on the community games, and I keep meaning to stay on top of them, but... Seriously, Carnivale.

26:39.132 --> 26:39.512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

26:39.692 --> 26:41.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll definitely make it a point to check that one out.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.333
[SPEAKER_03]: I even bought a bigger hard drive so I could download more games.

26:44.513 --> 26:46.154
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I swear I will at some point.

26:46.534 --> 26:47.654
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually had some pretty cool stuff.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.555
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a music-making program on there now.

26:50.148 --> 26:50.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of neat.

26:50.788 --> 26:52.509
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to check it out.

26:53.089 --> 26:55.851
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about some other top tens?

26:56.271 --> 26:58.972
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is Eurogamer's top ten games.

27:00.072 --> 27:02.814
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking a little bit to the overseas opinion.

27:03.254 --> 27:08.116
[SPEAKER_05]: But number ten was World of Goo, which is WiiWare and PC.

27:08.216 --> 27:13.678
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually something that I was really interested in, just because it looks so bizarre.

27:16.940 --> 27:20.581
[SPEAKER_05]: The next one is Guitar Hero World Tour for 9th place.

27:23.723 --> 27:25.944
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to use your slow internet to get to the next page.

27:26.104 --> 27:26.344
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

27:26.504 --> 27:31.166
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of people hating on Guitar Hero World Tour when I talked to them.

27:31.507 --> 27:32.727
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Europe.

27:33.027 --> 27:33.868
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but still.

27:33.888 --> 27:35.568
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like it's a completely different game.

27:35.728 --> 27:36.609
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

27:37.398 --> 27:38.698
[SPEAKER_05]: Gears of War 2 Gears of War 2

28:02.645 --> 28:03.145
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto 4

28:31.708 --> 28:32.669
[SPEAKER_05]: You all knew it would be up there.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.411
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to number two.

28:36.372 --> 28:40.675
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two is Fallout 3, which is pretty darn awesome.

28:41.356 --> 28:42.817
[SPEAKER_05]: And number one is LittleBigPlanet.

28:44.258 --> 28:46.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent choice for LittleBigPlanet.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.001
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't hear Rock Band 2.

28:50.303 --> 28:53.325
[SPEAKER_03]: So they put Guitar Hero World Tour on this list, but they didn't put Rock Band 2 on there?

28:53.885 --> 28:54.546
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did Rock Band 2 not get released over there yet?

28:57.608 --> 28:58.229
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.

28:58.249 --> 28:58.969
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they got it.

29:01.516 --> 29:04.017
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they didn't have nearly the delay we had over here.

29:04.537 --> 29:05.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

29:06.638 --> 29:10.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were feeling... This is just one particular website, obviously.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.581
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the whole country's opinion.

29:11.981 --> 29:18.324
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe this particular website was put off by the fact it felt like more of an upgrade to the previous Rock Band game.

29:18.924 --> 29:27.368
[SPEAKER_04]: There was this story, kind of tied in with this too, that Peter Moore was pissed off at EA because FIFA didn't make the list.

29:29.221 --> 29:29.641
[SPEAKER_03]: How so?

29:29.661 --> 29:30.502
[SPEAKER_03]: How so?

29:49.833 --> 29:50.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

29:50.834 --> 29:53.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe that's just a hint to, you know, do... I don't know.

29:53.876 --> 29:59.200
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play the game, so I don't know if it's good or not, but you know, maybe it's just a hint to do better next time?

30:00.341 --> 30:00.621
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

30:01.522 --> 30:11.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, PS3 may not have led as far as console game playing share, but they are leading in one thing, and that is web browsing.

30:12.391 --> 30:16.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii, PlayStation 3 has won.

30:17.034 --> 30:17.855
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have

30:18.732 --> 30:19.192
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

30:44.941 --> 30:48.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what do people actually browse the web for on their TV?

30:48.825 --> 30:51.947
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't imagine checking my email on the TV and stuff.

30:51.967 --> 30:52.908
[SPEAKER_03]: That would just be terrible.

30:53.048 --> 30:54.990
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube and PornoTube, that's pretty much it.

30:55.130 --> 30:56.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly what I was going to say.

30:56.431 --> 30:59.114
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube and XTube are pretty much all I can think of.

30:59.154 --> 30:59.774
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say this.

31:00.175 --> 31:00.575
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually...

31:01.716 --> 31:02.697
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

31:29.485 --> 31:50.109
[SPEAKER_03]: That you, you know, develop the weed Don't give a shit about online I see, I see And then I saw the jizz in my pants thing And it wasn't as funny as they made it out to be, I have to say But it was still kind of funny Anyway, if you have no idea what I'm talking about Google it or something Oh What?

31:50.809 --> 31:58.851
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally unrelated, but They have a new Charlie the Unicorn that they did for YouTube Live It's hilarious It's short, though

31:59.602 --> 32:01.184
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:11.764 --> 32:23.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've been keeping our eye on the game blogs this week, and one thing that caught our eye on one of the game blogs was this story on Joystick about a study that buff game characters apparently give men a negative body image.

32:23.787 --> 32:24.867
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this is interesting.

32:24.907 --> 32:25.807
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why this is interesting?

32:25.847 --> 32:32.729
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we hear all the freaking time about, you know, women and the supermodels and the wafer-thin looks and, you know...

32:33.089 --> 32:34.170
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

32:52.245 --> 33:06.273
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently they're quoting a study from researchers at Kansas State University and apparently what the study showed is that if you view extreme body images in games I don't know what that means extreme body images in games like is there like

33:08.490 --> 33:08.871
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

33:23.650 --> 33:24.391
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I don't know.

33:24.731 --> 33:39.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, but they say 15 minutes of seeing these extreme body images, it's enough to give both males and females, so it's not just, you know, here we go with women again, sadly, unfortunately, having to look at this in the media, giving them a negative impression of their own body image.

33:39.705 --> 33:40.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's bullshit.

33:40.886 --> 33:41.307
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

33:41.327 --> 33:42.168
[SPEAKER_03]: You think it's all bullshit?

33:42.188 --> 33:42.928
[SPEAKER_04]: That is bullshit.

33:43.008 --> 33:44.550
[SPEAKER_04]: I play games with, you know,

33:45.925 --> 33:47.086
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an N64 game.

34:15.322 --> 34:20.606
[SPEAKER_03]: The Rock, Big Boss Man, and The Undertaker

34:40.802 --> 34:42.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrestling or gay porn?

34:42.083 --> 34:42.863
[SPEAKER_03]: You be the judge.

34:42.943 --> 34:43.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

34:43.543 --> 34:45.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't watch a lot of wrestling, but damn.

34:46.545 --> 34:47.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Boss Man?

34:48.786 --> 34:51.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think I saw him at Folsom Street Fair.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.627
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Boss Man was awesome.

34:53.168 --> 34:53.848
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

34:56.209 --> 35:00.111
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the second study was women and they had to play a beach volleyball game.

35:00.671 --> 35:03.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's probably DOA beach volleyball right there.

35:03.432 --> 35:04.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

35:04.193 --> 35:04.513
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

35:08.202 --> 35:15.384
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the story goes on to say, both male and female subjects viewed their own bodies more negatively after completing a cycle at the game control.

35:15.725 --> 35:21.647
[SPEAKER_03]: He said the immediacy of reaction by game players was disturbing because video games are such a powerful element of popular culture.

35:21.967 --> 35:25.428
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the weird thing is that they were playing like sports video games.

35:26.288 --> 35:26.868
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

35:26.888 --> 35:28.389
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, they probably...

35:29.497 --> 35:31.298
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's anyone that goes and plays a game of like...

35:55.399 --> 36:03.127
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Conan or something like that and then goes and cries because their body is like, you know, pathetic compared to that.

36:03.487 --> 36:08.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I don't want to look like some of these, you know, big guys because I don't want to be addicted to steroids and crack.

36:08.832 --> 36:12.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I do have to say, though, playing games with lots of guns makes me want to own guns.

36:12.736 --> 36:13.276
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is...

36:14.244 --> 36:16.626
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, you know, that correlation.

36:16.786 --> 36:20.550
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say that because there's a lot of people out there that are going to use that.

36:20.630 --> 36:23.212
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, oh, it just incites violence.

36:23.592 --> 36:28.216
[SPEAKER_03]: See, this guy on this radio show says now he wants a gun because he plays games with guns.

36:28.556 --> 36:29.517
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's going to shoot.

36:29.577 --> 36:30.638
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

36:30.878 --> 36:32.740
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a G36C.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.783
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I've got that to go along with my shotgun and my P90.

36:37.381 --> 36:38.081
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

36:38.802 --> 36:40.082
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and my high cap of 5.1.

36:40.122 --> 36:41.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

36:41.843 --> 36:44.363
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hobby that I really shouldn't be getting into.

36:45.244 --> 36:46.104
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

36:46.184 --> 36:46.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

36:47.424 --> 36:48.985
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading some comments from chat room.

36:49.005 --> 36:52.026
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, did the N64 just get released in Kansas?

36:52.766 --> 36:53.947
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, I don't know.

36:54.427 --> 36:55.888
[SPEAKER_03]: This story had to have butchered something.

36:58.109 --> 37:00.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Kazzaum, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.

37:00.550 --> 37:04.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Kazzaum says, I bet every woman wishes they could jiggle their boobs like that.

37:04.952 --> 37:06.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably referencing Dead or Alive.

37:07.733 --> 37:09.094
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that would hurt.

37:09.674 --> 37:16.037
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had boobs and I don't really want to, but I would think that if you jiggle them a lot, it would really start to hurt.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I were to try and jiggle my balls...

37:21.445 --> 37:23.688
[SPEAKER_02]: That would probably hurt after a little while.

37:26.872 --> 37:28.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it hurt if you run naked?

37:30.636 --> 37:31.837
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it feels quite free.

37:34.727 --> 37:35.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

37:35.467 --> 37:36.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try.

37:36.147 --> 37:41.208
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, they were playing the old game.

37:41.248 --> 37:45.349
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it might have been mistyped or something like that, but it's actually WWF.

37:45.449 --> 37:48.270
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, WWF hasn't been around for a while now.

37:48.410 --> 37:49.130
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

37:49.150 --> 37:51.250
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing reporting, Doug.

37:51.270 --> 37:56.511
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but if you've played one of those wrestling games, you've played them all, they're all pretty much exactly the same.

37:56.651 --> 38:00.712
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's probably all they could afford with our dying economy in Kansas.

38:01.902 --> 38:04.864
[SPEAKER_03]: in between the ramen and all that.

38:06.045 --> 38:06.325
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

38:08.287 --> 38:09.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, just rent a game.

38:09.768 --> 38:10.628
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, God.

38:12.089 --> 38:13.811
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, 1964, what is this?

38:15.052 --> 38:15.652
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember that.

38:17.613 --> 38:17.914
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

38:19.174 --> 38:20.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, sorry, I...

38:23.834 --> 38:28.876
[SPEAKER_03]: PressLol is in chat, a co-host of Saturday Night's Understation Live here on All Games.

38:29.196 --> 38:31.656
[SPEAKER_03]: He's screaming, Photoshop robs balls.

38:32.036 --> 38:33.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you want to do that?

38:33.917 --> 38:34.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

38:35.197 --> 38:37.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you even suggest that people do that?

38:37.178 --> 38:41.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're talking about playing pool and billiard balls.

38:41.539 --> 38:42.660
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Or beach balls.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm going on a trip to the beach.

38:46.201 --> 38:47.061
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a beach ball.

38:47.685 --> 38:54.951
[SPEAKER_03]: or I'm at Walmart and I'm standing in front of one of those big cages full of balls and I'm trying to undo the thing at the bottom so that they all roll out onto the floor.

38:56.452 --> 38:57.252
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

38:58.473 --> 39:00.895
[SPEAKER_03]: But whatever you're suggesting is not okay.

39:01.215 --> 39:02.877
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we all know billiards is gay.

39:03.337 --> 39:04.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, shut up.

39:05.018 --> 39:06.319
[SPEAKER_05]: I like knocking around some balls.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't like to knock around some balls once in a while?

39:09.822 --> 39:11.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, let's move on with some gaming news.

39:11.710 --> 39:25.137
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for those of us who are Xbox owners and are really enjoying the whole, you know, Avatar thingy that's going around, there's some new accessories to be coming out.

39:25.237 --> 39:26.637
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, different Avatar clothing.

39:29.446 --> 39:30.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Your phone talks funny!

39:31.647 --> 39:32.947
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm yelling at Sauce.

39:33.067 --> 39:34.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Her phone just went off in studio.

39:35.008 --> 39:39.570
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's basically a rave pack that's going to be coming out.

39:40.290 --> 39:49.154
[SPEAKER_05]: For the boys, there's a pixel art hoodie, a rave baseball cap, pink sweatbands, green skinny fit jeans, and dark purple jeans.

39:50.273 --> 39:51.694
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that you can't use that for the girls.

39:52.494 --> 40:06.684
[SPEAKER_05]: For the girls, there's a green chunky ring, a red chunky ring, yellow fingerless gloves, blue fingerless gloves, chunky beaded bracelet, Dayglo zebra print pumps, and rave baseball cap, and none of that sounds.

40:15.249 --> 40:17.851
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can add your very own rave on your Xbox!

40:20.035 --> 40:21.456
[SPEAKER_05]: The boys stuff sounds better.

40:23.157 --> 40:23.878
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck a bunch of that.

40:49.181 --> 40:52.482
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I should take offense to that or not, but whatever, it was funny.

40:53.682 --> 40:54.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

40:54.542 --> 40:58.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, seriously, there's a clear difference between gay and rave.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at a rave, everyone's kind of gay.

41:01.704 --> 41:04.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if you've ever actually been to a rave, but like, come on.

41:05.786 --> 41:07.186
[SPEAKER_03]: A cuddle room, Loki.

41:08.246 --> 41:11.487
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of raves have a cuddle room, where everybody, you know what they do?

41:12.167 --> 41:12.788
[SPEAKER_03]: They cuddle.

41:13.568 --> 41:13.988
[SPEAKER_03]: All night.

41:15.031 --> 41:15.792
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of gay.

41:15.812 --> 41:18.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Several of your parties have a cuddle room.

41:18.376 --> 41:21.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I'm gay, so it's understandable.

41:22.422 --> 41:28.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they want to grope the easy chicks, and they're all high on ecstasy, so why not?

41:31.582 --> 41:34.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, everybody's happy when they're on ecstasy.

41:35.428 --> 41:40.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on with some more news, please, before we get letters from angry parents.

41:40.556 --> 41:44.602
[SPEAKER_04]: Square Enix is bringing their next epic game to Xbox Live Arcade.

41:45.529 --> 41:48.910
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it feature Cloud or possibly any other Final Fantasy characters?

41:49.411 --> 41:52.232
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because it's not an epic game, it's a puzzle game instead.

41:52.572 --> 41:53.972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Yosemin Live.

41:54.072 --> 41:56.573
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

41:57.194 --> 42:01.395
[SPEAKER_04]: The game kind of looks a little bit like Bajul, except you're supposed to be making triangles out of the characters.

42:02.496 --> 42:06.337
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like everything has frowny faces on it.

42:06.698 --> 42:09.599
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's one very unhappy puzzle game.

42:10.439 --> 42:13.021
[SPEAKER_04]: If everything didn't have faces, you wouldn't want to punch it Good point, good point

42:34.557 --> 42:42.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious because the smile on the block is better than mine and I'm going to have to go see a counselor because of that because I'm having issues.

42:42.743 --> 42:45.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Body image issues from USMN Live.

42:47.706 --> 42:49.567
[SPEAKER_03]: I want my hair to be as spiky as clouds.

42:49.627 --> 42:50.388
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having issues.

42:52.554 --> 43:16.353
[SPEAKER_04]: but apparently they're going to have this game come out also on the PlayStation Network at some point as well but right now it's been confirmed for Xbox Live Arcade because there's a shot that shows achievements so that's their hypothesis I guess I'm sorry, here's the comment of 2009 in our chat room right now and I can say that because we're only what, like four days into 2009?

43:17.454 --> 43:22.018
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says the cuddle room is like the champagne room there's no sex going on

43:25.639 --> 43:31.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Be Good Johnny by Men at Work and Let's Groove by Earth, Wind & Fire

43:49.335 --> 43:50.956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably have to pick it up

44:09.690 --> 44:10.330
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

44:25.376 --> 44:26.716
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and here's what I want to see.

44:26.736 --> 44:32.418
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see someone import in Max 300 or something like that and see how that works.

44:32.838 --> 44:33.978
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that would be funny.

44:34.379 --> 44:35.919
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no lyrics to Max 300.

44:35.959 --> 44:37.419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's funny.

44:38.420 --> 44:39.360
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole point.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.201
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only song that Matt would sing in karaoke anymore.

44:42.221 --> 44:43.301
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wouldn't sing it at all.

44:44.641 --> 44:51.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, like Orange Lounge Radio, if nothing else, this show has accomplished single-handedly destroying karaoke for Loki.

44:52.184 --> 44:53.204
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'll never sing it again.

44:53.933 --> 44:58.074
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't really destroy something that wasn't ever really built up in the first place.

44:58.434 --> 44:58.754
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

44:59.935 --> 45:01.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, check it out if you want.

45:03.035 --> 45:09.277
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is a reward, I should say.

45:09.577 --> 45:11.137
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe a gift.

45:12.118 --> 45:18.239
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is an Xbox 360 Military Appreciation Bundle.

45:18.379 --> 45:19.960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

45:20.020 --> 45:21.680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an Appreciation Bundle.

45:23.507 --> 45:25.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Typo on the damn page.

45:26.370 --> 45:28.072
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a typo on the damn box.

45:28.472 --> 45:31.836
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it is a typo on the box.

45:33.317 --> 45:33.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.782
[SPEAKER_05]: But you want to know what's even more hilarious about this?

45:38.063 --> 45:38.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, go ahead.

45:39.324 --> 45:39.965
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all,

45:42.407 --> 45:50.715
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it's $299.95, and it's the pack that comes with Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda.

45:51.897 --> 45:57.783
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also sold this at Best Buy for the same price.

45:58.183 --> 45:59.825
[SPEAKER_04]: But they include Blue Dragon now.

46:01.206 --> 46:03.068
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the one we bought was the same thing.

46:05.042 --> 46:08.745
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're basically unloading all their excess copies of Blue Dragon that didn't sell?

46:08.925 --> 46:09.225
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

46:09.365 --> 46:11.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, there's no Blue Dragon in this pack.

46:11.667 --> 46:14.749
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the same one that Best Buy was selling for Christmas.

46:15.490 --> 46:19.452
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the dog tag in the corner and sure enough, Military Appreciation.

46:19.813 --> 46:22.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, sorry, Blue Dragon is included with that one.

46:22.194 --> 46:23.836
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, it was really tiny.

46:25.116 --> 46:25.677
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

46:26.457 --> 46:26.878
[SPEAKER_05]: But still.

46:27.678 --> 46:30.160
[SPEAKER_03]: But what exactly, where does the money go to?

46:30.460 --> 46:31.281
[SPEAKER_05]: To appreciate them.

46:33.143 --> 46:38.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to a charity or is this like are they selling this like in a particular area of Texas?

46:38.344 --> 46:39.884
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selling it on the military basis.

46:40.645 --> 46:43.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was the PX.

46:43.865 --> 46:45.566
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a cheap marketing thing and nothing more.

46:45.626 --> 46:49.407
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no donation to a military society or veterans fund.

46:49.467 --> 46:50.247
[SPEAKER_05]: We want money.

46:50.407 --> 46:51.167
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, your board.

46:51.527 --> 46:51.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

46:52.567 --> 46:52.927
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

46:53.207 --> 46:53.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

46:53.927 --> 46:54.108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

46:56.328 --> 47:00.369
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not only do you get the Xbox 360 with three games, but you get another free game

47:01.308 --> 47:02.308
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like worth 20 bucks.

47:03.069 --> 47:03.429
[SPEAKER_04]: If that.

47:05.610 --> 47:07.330
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't pay any taxes on base.

47:07.631 --> 47:08.711
[SPEAKER_07]: Military personnel don't.

47:08.751 --> 47:13.073
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's another added incentive to buy it on base rather than off base.

47:13.293 --> 47:15.674
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that's the cheapest one, then why not?

47:16.674 --> 47:17.475
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's a good point.

47:18.615 --> 47:22.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Because tax can really add up on some of those multi-hundred dollar purchases.

47:22.697 --> 47:23.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

47:23.477 --> 47:23.597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

47:24.810 --> 47:26.492
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

47:44.529 --> 47:57.813
[SPEAKER_04]: One new way that's been pointed out by Popular Science is that you can actually download a freeware program to use an outdated wireless router and use that as a wireless gaming receiver as well.

47:58.954 --> 48:03.155
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course that will cost you whatever you can find for a cheap router for.

48:03.815 --> 48:12.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, as I've been reading as well, you can actually use the original Xbox wireless gaming receiver which is under $50.

48:14.389 --> 48:28.057
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting or pretty much any wireless gaming receiver out there that's probably cheaper than $99.99 yeah I paid $99.99 for my little wireless gaming receiver it's not an official Xbox one but it's like a third party one that will also work with my PS2 which is why I bought it um

48:28.956 --> 48:48.462
[SPEAKER_03]: but man, that was $100 just so I can use One reason, one thing I will give props to the PlayStation 3 for as hard of a time as I've given that system in the past I didn't have to set anything up well, yeah, I had to go through a setup but there was no wireless thing, it has built-in wireless on it like they all should Mine doesn't Really?

48:49.222 --> 48:58.185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 20 gig Oh, that's right I forgot they didn't all have that I also don't have the fancy memory card ports for, you know

48:58.720 --> 48:59.701
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think mine has that either.

48:59.821 --> 49:00.282
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

49:00.322 --> 49:00.882
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't either.

49:01.062 --> 49:01.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

49:01.843 --> 49:02.644
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you use them for?

49:03.344 --> 49:04.085
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, sorry.

49:04.245 --> 49:06.327
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought I'd bring that up.

49:06.427 --> 49:11.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, you know, a lot of us have those Xbox 360 HD drives.

49:12.673 --> 49:14.135
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not really using them anymore.

49:14.155 --> 49:17.959
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys, but I actually unplugged mine because I have maybe like seven movies.

49:18.259 --> 49:19.160
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even really watch them.

49:19.580 --> 49:20.641
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

49:38.680 --> 49:40.342
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this is just the...

49:54.698 --> 49:58.281
[SPEAKER_03]: HD DVD player, or if you do this with the actual Xbox 360?

49:58.522 --> 49:59.903
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's the HD DVD player.

50:00.363 --> 50:00.783
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

50:01.404 --> 50:06.528
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, you break it apart, and you can take the blue diode out of it, and you hook it up.

50:06.948 --> 50:13.774
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed it basically hooked up to a laser sight on a gun, but pretty much anything that has a laser emitting diode.

50:14.234 --> 50:16.336
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make your own burning laser out of it.

50:16.536 --> 50:16.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

50:17.057 --> 50:19.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a shark with a freaking laser beam on its head.

50:19.138 --> 50:20.159
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually make your own.

50:20.539 --> 50:21.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Shark not included.

50:21.280 --> 50:21.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

50:21.380 --> 50:26.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, basically you take the diode out and you build this really small chip that goes with it.

50:26.964 --> 50:33.069
[SPEAKER_04]: You hook that up and voila, burning laser that can pop balloons and burn paper.

50:33.089 --> 50:34.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Can it melt faces?

50:34.330 --> 50:36.512
[SPEAKER_04]: If it can't melt faces, it's worthless.

50:36.652 --> 50:41.656
[SPEAKER_04]: It might hurt if you leave it on someone's face for a while, but I don't know if it can melt faces.

50:41.756 --> 50:42.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow, ow, that hurts.

50:42.457 --> 50:43.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that dot off my head.

50:43.497 --> 50:44.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow, ow, ow.

50:44.659 --> 50:51.722
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as a disclaimer, please do not try Lasik surgery at home by yourself using your HD DVD drive.

50:52.119 --> 50:54.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Launch Radio does not endorse you actually doing this.

50:54.720 --> 50:59.861
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of cool that you can make a face-melting laser out of your Xbox 360.

50:59.921 --> 51:10.184
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't want to break apart your HD-DVD drive because of signal-melting value or anything like that, you can either buy your own burning laser or you can buy a laser diode for $50.

51:11.424 --> 51:13.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran in chat says, laser cats can be a reality.

51:15.025 --> 51:16.446
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not give this to my cat.

51:17.881 --> 51:18.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it to her head.

51:19.082 --> 51:20.743
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, kitty, ah!

51:21.483 --> 51:24.785
[SPEAKER_03]: I would come home and it would look like a BB gun army ran through my house.

51:26.086 --> 51:27.527
[SPEAKER_04]: The house would be on fire.

51:28.588 --> 51:29.288
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

51:29.949 --> 51:31.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not give this to a cat.

51:31.410 --> 51:34.992
[SPEAKER_03]: If you give this to a cat, you're beyond an idiot.

51:35.172 --> 51:38.914
[SPEAKER_04]: They're staring at the birds outside and saw, poof!

51:42.236 --> 51:42.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

51:44.097 --> 51:44.978
[SPEAKER_04]: All sorts of awesome.

51:45.987 --> 51:47.929
[SPEAKER_04]: You come home in the fish tank spoiling.

51:49.430 --> 51:52.553
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that would happen, but yeah.

51:52.573 --> 51:53.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to that effect.

51:53.394 --> 51:54.355
[SPEAKER_04]: The fish would be dead.

51:54.515 --> 51:56.818
[SPEAKER_04]: Her food would be toasty.

51:56.938 --> 52:00.001
[SPEAKER_04]: The birds would be on the ground, missing feathers.

52:01.182 --> 52:02.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Pew, pew, pew, mew, mew, mew.

52:04.821 --> 52:05.862
[SPEAKER_03]: James Bond's weapon of choice, the Walter PPK.

52:05.882 --> 52:09.487
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to use the real gun, but a high-performance semi-automatic CO2 version.

52:24.429 --> 52:29.150
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it burn, we need an Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.

52:29.610 --> 52:30.150
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.

52:30.170 --> 52:34.771
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where this video comes from, but I see a little logo for Break in the corner, so we'll just leave it at that.

52:34.871 --> 52:35.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there like an embed thing?

52:37.152 --> 52:39.712
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the hell site this is, so whatever.

52:39.952 --> 52:40.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play the rest of it.

52:40.653 --> 52:41.093
[SPEAKER_00]: Get apart.

52:41.593 --> 52:44.373
[SPEAKER_00]: The side panel snaps off and reveals some hidden screws.

52:44.793 --> 52:45.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're right.

52:45.253 --> 52:46.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Break.com.

52:46.294 --> 52:47.614
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to work and remove all of them.

52:48.172 --> 52:52.537
[SPEAKER_00]: After popping off the cover, it's time to get rid of some more screws until the DVD drive is freed up.

52:52.557 --> 52:53.758
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I want to see them burn stuff.

52:53.778 --> 52:55.139
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about the whole process.

52:55.159 --> 52:56.120
[SPEAKER_00]: It's boring.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.563
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the laser assembly gets attached to the Walther.

53:05.204 --> 53:21.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, if I were still smoking cigarettes, which I don't encourage anyone to do because it's very addicting and I quit, but if I were still smoking cigarettes, what an awesome way to light my cigarette.

53:21.572 --> 53:24.633
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on guys, I gotta get my gun to light my cigarette.

53:25.706 --> 53:26.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

53:37.788 --> 53:43.049
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, just had to dream I was a super spy for a minute with all these kinds of cool gadgets.

53:44.090 --> 53:47.971
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I won't be getting one of these anytime soon because I'm sure there's laws against it.

53:48.051 --> 53:51.171
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there are some cool new games I could be getting pretty soon.

53:52.392 --> 53:55.192
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd have to travel to Europe to get some of these games.

53:55.593 --> 53:56.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, DarkSakura?

53:57.573 --> 53:58.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, nothing.

53:59.694 --> 54:00.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing?

54:00.174 --> 54:01.114
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing I can buy?

54:01.624 --> 54:02.525
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing on the list.

54:02.985 --> 54:04.206
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I guess I get my laser.

54:04.226 --> 54:04.886
[SPEAKER_05]: Not until the 16th.

54:05.046 --> 54:06.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I get my laser.

54:06.527 --> 54:07.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any releases in the U.S.?

54:08.169 --> 54:11.071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there are some crappy releases coming to the U.S.

54:12.031 --> 54:15.874
[SPEAKER_04]: The first being Paws and Claws Pampered Pets for the Nintendo DS.

54:16.955 --> 54:21.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that's an ugly looking picture there with chihuahuas and ugly cats.

54:22.198 --> 54:23.279
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all ugly characters.

54:23.679 --> 54:26.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Paws and Claws Pet Resort, the same game but now on the Wii.

54:28.343 --> 54:31.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Bigfoot Collision Course on the Nintendo DS.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.006
[SPEAKER_04]: No pets involved with that one.

54:33.527 --> 54:36.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Elebits, The Adventures of Kai and Zero on the DS.

54:36.989 --> 54:41.233
[SPEAKER_04]: The sequel to the cool 3D game and now this is more like Pokemon.

54:42.514 --> 54:45.656
[SPEAKER_04]: Moon is coming out from Mastiff on the Nintendo DS.

54:46.677 --> 54:49.419
[SPEAKER_04]: Fishing Master World Tour on the Nintendo Wii.

54:50.440 --> 54:54.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Jumble Madness, another fun puzzle game on the DS.

54:55.664 --> 54:56.605
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see here.

54:58.561 --> 55:00.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Neighborhood Games on Nintendo Wii

55:02.377 --> 55:07.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Personal Trainer Math from Nintendo, because Nintendo thinks you don't know math.

55:07.699 --> 55:11.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I interrupt these shitty games with a funny chatroom comment?

55:11.901 --> 55:12.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

55:12.081 --> 55:17.023
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as much as I'm sure our listening audience cares about all these fucking math games, this is just too funny.

55:18.083 --> 55:24.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, we're a little bit delayed, so sometimes our comments on the previous story take a little while to run through chat, so a comment on the whole laser thing.

55:24.866 --> 55:28.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran in chat says, Imagine holding up a convenience store with that.

55:28.827 --> 55:30.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the money or I'll fucking laser your face.

55:35.256 --> 55:38.099
[SPEAKER_02]: Sloth's Radio does not condone these actions.

55:38.419 --> 55:40.241
[SPEAKER_05]: You could brand somebody with a laser.

55:42.103 --> 55:43.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sorry, Loki.

55:43.064 --> 55:45.908
[SPEAKER_03]: Continue telling us about the edutainment titles of plenty coming out this week.

55:45.928 --> 55:46.628
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's actually it.

55:46.828 --> 55:47.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

55:47.749 --> 55:47.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

55:49.151 --> 55:50.212
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, then let's talk about... What?

55:50.232 --> 55:51.093
[SPEAKER_05]: No Jazz Jackrabbit?

55:51.473 --> 55:51.754
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

55:52.987 --> 55:57.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about Japan and what you can look forward to over there.

56:10.219 --> 56:30.094
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3 nada coming out this week you gotta wait till the 15th for anything coming out over there Fallout 3 makes its debut on the 15th you have that to look forward to on the PlayStation 2 nothing on the DS nothing till the 15th and it's probably the same story on the PSP as well

56:30.734 --> 56:31.594
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really it.

56:31.775 --> 56:35.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you want some price reductions, there is a Mobile Suit Gundam game on the PSP.

56:36.217 --> 56:40.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Giren no Yabu, Axis no Kayui gets a price reduction.

56:40.439 --> 56:40.799
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

56:41.479 --> 56:43.940
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the week of sales in Japan.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, no new stuff until the 15th.

56:47.022 --> 56:49.323
[SPEAKER_05]: Well then how about just a little something else?

56:50.063 --> 56:50.524
[SPEAKER_03]: How about it?

56:51.804 --> 56:52.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff.

56:52.585 --> 56:53.185
[SPEAKER_05]: And nonsense.

56:53.745 --> 56:54.706
[SPEAKER_05]: And download content!

56:57.707 --> 56:58.307
[SPEAKER_05]: Horse armor?

56:58.768 --> 56:59.328
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

57:01.294 --> 57:02.795
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like Oblivion had the horse armor?

57:03.435 --> 57:05.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

57:06.157 --> 57:06.497
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

57:06.657 --> 57:06.937
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

57:08.958 --> 57:16.362
[SPEAKER_05]: For the fans of Guitar Hero World Tour, there is a downloadable content dated.

57:16.482 --> 57:22.185
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually will be coming out January 2009 at some point eventually.

57:22.705 --> 57:24.846
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go ahead and go by the date.

57:25.367 --> 57:28.868
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be... Actually, this should already...

57:31.155 --> 57:37.300
[SPEAKER_05]: BeOut is Use Me by Hinder, Because of You by Nickelback, and Light It Up by Rev Theory.

[SPEAKER_05]: The album is going to be 1,520 Microsoft points or $18.99 from the PlayStation Store.

58:30.434 --> 58:35.317
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to ask if that was the first full album for Guitar Hero, but I guess it's not because they had the Metallica one.

58:35.357 --> 58:38.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Death Magnetic came out the full album when the CD came out, right?

58:38.478 --> 58:39.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not the first album that they've had.

58:39.999 --> 58:40.679
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had a few.

58:40.959 --> 58:41.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.761
[SPEAKER_05]: Metallica is infinitely more awesome than Oasis.

58:46.822 --> 58:47.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd say so.

58:48.519 --> 59:17.881
[SPEAKER_04]: so interesting um some other cool stuff that's coming out on the other music game platform Rock Band um the January lineup has been leaked out as they seem to always happen um to do of course we already knew that Roy Orbison was getting a download pack um there are going to be six tracks available there Claudette in Dreams Mean Woman Blues Oh Pretty Woman Ooby Dooby and You Got It um

59:29.662 --> 59:34.185
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally two tracks from the Steve Miller band, The Joker and Space Cowboy.

59:35.595 --> 59:37.296
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want Pretty Woman and I want The Joker

01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:02.874
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:00:23.834 --> 01:00:24.635
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:00:38.095 --> 01:00:39.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario World and Sonic 2

01:01:04.195 --> 01:01:07.716
[SPEAKER_03]: So the mom asked what virtual console is and da-da-da.

01:01:08.337 --> 01:01:12.638
[SPEAKER_03]: And the kid said, all you have to do is put in your credit card when you're prompted to on the shop channel.

01:01:13.358 --> 01:01:14.119
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does she do?

01:01:14.939 --> 01:01:18.040
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually tried to put three credit cards into the disc slot.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.681
[SPEAKER_05]: What a fucking moron.

01:01:21.903 --> 01:01:22.924
[SPEAKER_03]: It is both possible and rampant.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:50.530
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:51.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people actually think that?

01:01:51.531 --> 01:01:55.852
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, doesn't the screen make it pretty clear that you put in your credit card number?

01:01:56.213 --> 01:02:03.055
[SPEAKER_13]: There are people out there who do not touch half the buttons on their TV remotes because they think it will make the TV explode.

01:02:03.075 --> 01:02:08.118
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they need those buttons.

01:02:08.598 --> 01:02:10.959
[SPEAKER_13]: Do not push else explosion.

01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:15.821
[SPEAKER_13]: I am teaching certain family members to use the digital cable guide as we speak.

01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:19.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, though.

01:02:19.093 --> 01:02:21.234
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say Comcast's system is pretty screwy.

01:02:21.274 --> 01:02:24.156
[SPEAKER_03]: That does take a class or two to learn how to use.

01:02:24.196 --> 01:02:26.558
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you need a college degree to be able to navigate that.

01:02:26.578 --> 01:02:27.679
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes about 15 minutes.

01:02:27.739 --> 01:02:28.960
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not TiVo, Drew.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.781
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never used TiVo.

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:33.023
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happy face and frown face.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.725
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to rate things.

01:02:36.025 --> 01:02:38.807
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a four-year-old could figure it out, I hope.

01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:40.908
[SPEAKER_03]: But Comcast?

01:02:41.048 --> 01:02:41.589
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of crappy.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:57.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Kazam in chat, the name I can't pronounce tonight, says, once my friend was at work, this woman came in and was buying a PlayStation 3 game, and she was asking him will it work on her VCR.

01:03:01.398 --> 01:03:02.599
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, ma'am, do you have a beta?

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:20.237
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, apparently this is what it looks like if you actually put your credit card in the Wii, is that then suddenly your system will have a lot of lines going through it and it's unable to read a disc because there's no actual disc in the system, just a jammed credit card.

01:03:21.338 --> 01:03:21.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats.

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:22.679
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God.

01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:26.946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I kind of call bullshit, but it's a funny story nonetheless.

01:03:26.986 --> 01:03:30.012
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know somewhere someone's tried to do it.

01:03:30.413 --> 01:03:35.302
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's happened here is that somebody's actually recorded it.

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:36.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow...

01:03:37.512 --> 01:03:41.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about something a lot more relevant and something the smart people do.

01:03:41.973 --> 01:03:49.115
[SPEAKER_03]: And what smart people do is that they go and they try to explore their gaming's history and play some obscure video games they may not have before.

01:03:49.515 --> 01:03:52.755
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkSakura, well, heck, she's one of the smartest and she's here to pick.

01:03:52.815 --> 01:03:54.456
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the most smartest, in fact.

01:03:54.876 --> 01:03:59.717
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's here to pick a video game for you to play this week in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:04:04.306 --> 01:04:05.708
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what should the kids play this week?

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:09.331
[SPEAKER_05]: The classic game of the week was suggested to me by Sauce.

01:04:10.072 --> 01:04:12.815
[SPEAKER_03]: I see, so this is a saucy way to kick in 2009.

01:04:15.297 --> 01:04:16.619
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain America and the Avengers.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

01:04:19.662 --> 01:04:21.544
[SPEAKER_05]: This game is classic.

01:04:22.685 --> 01:04:27.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Side-scrolling, beat-em-up action with cheeseball voice acting.

01:04:29.501 --> 01:04:33.863
[SPEAKER_05]: and wonderful background music.

01:04:34.464 --> 01:04:37.065
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just have some of this background music.

01:04:38.145 --> 01:04:38.906
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we, Rob?

01:04:41.947 --> 01:04:44.169
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe after the story part.

01:04:55.570 --> 01:05:03.477
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you get to play as one of four of the Avengers, either Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, or Vision.

01:05:03.797 --> 01:05:06.880
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, why Vision is all white and not green and red?

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Christmas is beyond me.

01:05:10.403 --> 01:05:12.865
[SPEAKER_05]: It could just be graphical limitations at the time.

01:05:14.146 --> 01:05:18.950
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can actually either play a four-player cabinet or a two-player cabinet.

01:05:19.351 --> 01:05:21.973
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to change it on the board itself.

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:22.874
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

01:05:23.314 --> 01:05:27.016
[SPEAKER_05]: and you get sound effects like in old comic books.

01:05:27.496 --> 01:05:28.437
[SPEAKER_05]: You get black.

01:05:29.557 --> 01:05:30.218
[SPEAKER_05]: Wham.

01:05:31.338 --> 01:05:32.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Or 60s Batman.

01:05:33.259 --> 01:05:34.380
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or 60s Batman.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.221
[SPEAKER_13]: I grew up on this freaking game.

01:05:36.261 --> 01:05:39.083
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember playing it at Pizza Hut when I was six.

01:05:39.863 --> 01:05:40.523
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's great.

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:45.306
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the reason I went out to eat Pizza Hut because the pizza certainly sucked.

01:05:46.427 --> 01:05:48.568
[SPEAKER_13]: I went there to play Captain America and the freaking event.

01:05:48.708 --> 01:05:51.329
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no, don't go to Pizza Hut and expect to get pizza.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:52.490
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh no.

01:05:54.990 --> 01:06:09.722
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, anyway, um, you, uh, you actually fight, um, different, you know, your bosses, which will be Claw, the Living Laser, Rowland, the Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin, I'm sorry, I still laugh at that.

01:06:10.643 --> 01:06:13.586
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Juggernaut, Ultron, Crossbones, and Red Skull.

01:06:14.847 --> 01:06:19.390
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also get cameos by other Avengers, which, um,

01:06:20.091 --> 01:06:21.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Was Namor ever an Avenger?

01:06:21.532 --> 01:06:23.053
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it says he's in the game.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.254
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think he ever really was one.

01:06:28.756 --> 01:06:33.818
[SPEAKER_05]: He was by hanging around sometimes and shouting in curious ways.

01:06:34.639 --> 01:06:38.841
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, but you had Wasp, Quicksilver, and Wonder Man.

01:06:39.401 --> 01:06:40.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Samuel L. Jackson in it?

01:06:41.442 --> 01:06:42.643
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this was before... Don't care.

01:06:43.723 --> 01:06:45.544
[SPEAKER_05]: This was before Ultimates.

01:06:46.585 --> 01:06:46.885
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

01:06:47.782 --> 01:06:50.167
[SPEAKER_05]: This was David Hasselhoff era.

01:06:57.156 --> 01:07:01.819
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, while the arcade version was great, the console ports really sucked.

01:07:27.516 --> 01:07:30.619
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had to save Vision and Iron Man from Mandarin.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was kind of like playing Bionic.

01:07:33.702 --> 01:07:37.385
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually had this map set up like Bionic Commando.

01:07:37.405 --> 01:07:38.626
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it was a platformer.

01:07:39.367 --> 01:07:40.468
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of sucked too.

01:07:41.068 --> 01:07:43.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, because Mandarin would so be able to do that.

01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:46.373
[SPEAKER_05]: As if.

01:07:46.533 --> 01:07:46.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:07:49.133 --> 01:08:01.260
[SPEAKER_05]: At any rate, another bit of fun trivia is that the North American version of the arcade machine, when your character dies, instead of saying continue or like that, it's like, America still needs your help.

01:08:03.261 --> 01:08:05.302
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the part I remember about this game.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Even I played this game when I was younger.

01:08:07.603 --> 01:08:08.543
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't six.

01:08:08.623 --> 01:08:09.484
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little bit older.

01:08:11.785 --> 01:08:15.167
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do remember that when you would die, America still needs your help.

01:08:17.376 --> 01:08:18.696
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't move!

01:08:19.637 --> 01:08:21.557
[SPEAKER_03]: It really tries to guilt you into continuing playing.

01:08:21.637 --> 01:08:25.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you don't put in another quarter, you are a terrorist.

01:08:26.459 --> 01:08:26.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:31.221
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, clearly that line was removed from the Asian-European versions.

01:08:32.662 --> 01:08:34.803
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Data East, make more pinball.

01:08:36.504 --> 01:08:37.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's our Avengers pinball?

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:39.385
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there it is, your classic video game of the week.

01:08:43.965 --> 01:08:45.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain America and the Avengers.

01:08:46.548 --> 01:08:48.190
[SPEAKER_05]: Please note... Sounds like a bad band.

01:08:48.411 --> 01:08:53.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically... Specifically, though, here, the arcade version.

01:08:54.179 --> 01:08:56.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the console versions, which are a little bit shit.

01:08:58.123 --> 01:08:58.703
[SPEAKER_12]: A little bit.

01:08:58.823 --> 01:08:59.464
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:00.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Your classic video game of the week.

01:09:01.084 --> 01:09:06.826
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be a hard one for the kids to find because, you know, we would never endorse downloading ROMs and playing them on emulators.

01:09:06.926 --> 01:09:07.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no.

01:09:07.486 --> 01:09:09.687
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we've never used MAME in our lives.

01:09:09.727 --> 01:09:13.048
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to need to find a pizza hut near you that still has this game.

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.108
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck with that.

01:09:14.508 --> 01:09:15.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us know what you find.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:16.969
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:09:17.089 --> 01:09:18.989
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to do it for this part A of our show.

01:09:19.049 --> 01:09:20.970
[SPEAKER_03]: But, hey, we still have plenty more, including...

01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:32.428
[SPEAKER_03]: including hello tonight we are going to play match game that's right tonight we're going to play match game and give away some prize we're going to tell them what the prize is that we're giving away tonight or do we keep it a secret or what are we doing

01:09:33.496 --> 01:09:36.597
[SPEAKER_07]: We will tell you right after the break.

01:09:36.617 --> 01:09:37.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good tease.

01:09:37.518 --> 01:09:37.758
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:09:38.278 --> 01:09:40.659
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll tell you right after the break, so stay tuned.

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:46.882
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the podcast listeners, though, they're not going to have to wait at all, except then again they don't get to play either because the game will be done by the time this hits the podcast feed.

01:09:47.122 --> 01:09:47.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:50.284
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise there will be a contest you can do very soon.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:52.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's take a break.

01:09:52.705 --> 01:09:54.766
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:01.292 --> 01:10:05.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 4th of 2009.

01:10:06.358 --> 01:10:09.161
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy because I'm eating ice cream.

01:10:09.661 --> 01:10:13.686
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura and Tiara Rara, or Sauce, brought ice cream tonight for us.

01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:17.650
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like the slow churn kind, so it's actually not that bad as far as fat goes either.

01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:18.991
[SPEAKER_03]: So that made me very happy.

01:10:19.252 --> 01:10:20.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you both for thinking of that.

01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:20.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

01:10:22.495 --> 01:10:24.436
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkNight in chat says, I hope you guys get brain freezes.

01:10:24.456 --> 01:10:26.337
[SPEAKER_03]: But what is the fabulous prize you're going to play for tonight?

01:10:26.357 --> 01:10:27.497
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tonight I have brought the prize.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:28.578
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a $25 Amazon gift certificate.

01:10:48.783 --> 01:10:52.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's like a DS game right there.

01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:53.645
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, very nice.

01:10:53.945 --> 01:10:56.286
[SPEAKER_03]: So is this courtesy AvengersTower.com?

01:10:56.786 --> 01:10:57.607
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, why not?

01:10:57.787 --> 01:10:58.147
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:10:58.247 --> 01:11:07.211
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured you guys have given like Xbox related stuff out as prizes before and some people don't have Xboxes or some people would rather spend it on other things.

01:11:07.271 --> 01:11:11.472
[SPEAKER_07]: So Amazon gift certificate kind of is whatever you want.

01:11:11.612 --> 01:11:15.314
[SPEAKER_07]: You can spend it game related or else whatever you want to spend it on.

01:11:16.018 --> 01:11:17.039
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:11:36.021 --> 01:11:37.061
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:12:02.971 --> 01:12:04.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Sad but true, sad but true.

01:12:05.172 --> 01:12:05.433
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:12:06.013 --> 01:12:08.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news before we get to the fancy prizes.

01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:10.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Big money, big prizes.

01:12:10.476 --> 01:12:11.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:13.158
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sweet.

01:12:13.818 --> 01:12:14.058
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

01:12:16.529 --> 01:12:18.130
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we talked about this last week.

01:12:18.170 --> 01:12:25.611
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some new Sega games, or I should say older Sega games, that were getting new ESRB listings.

01:12:26.351 --> 01:12:37.714
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of those actually, that wasn't quite part of one of the ESRB listings, but it's been re-registered by Sega for another trademark, would be Choo Choo Rocket.

01:12:38.294 --> 01:12:50.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently on December 22nd, Sega USA has re-registered Choo Choo trademark as one of many Dreamcast titles to get remade.

01:12:52.948 --> 01:13:00.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other trademarks that have been re-registered as well, Sonic Shuffle, Cosmic Smash, Jet Grind Radio, Virtual Lawn,

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:04.177
[SPEAKER_04]: and now Choo Choo Rocket.

01:13:05.098 --> 01:13:06.138
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.

01:13:06.178 --> 01:13:06.978
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what that means.

01:13:07.118 --> 01:13:13.959
[SPEAKER_04]: It might actually be possibly coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and WiiWare as people seem to think.

01:13:15.639 --> 01:13:16.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.140
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess if you're a huge fan of Choo Choo Rocket.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:18.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.700
[SPEAKER_03]: I was never that big on Choo Choo Rocket.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.681
[SPEAKER_05]: Choo Choo Rocket is crack.

01:13:22.801 --> 01:13:26.221
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that maybe some other big games will come out thanks to this.

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:27.942
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

01:13:28.922 --> 01:13:29.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:31.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm laughing.

01:13:31.647 --> 01:13:32.928
[SPEAKER_03]: If I sound like I'm laughing, it's because I am.

01:13:33.488 --> 01:13:36.329
[SPEAKER_03]: I really shouldn't do this, but I send private messages during the show.

01:13:36.809 --> 01:13:38.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Jamie does it too.

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:40.510
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all chatting during the show.

01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:42.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I send funny things.

01:13:43.311 --> 01:13:44.112
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm laughing.

01:13:44.192 --> 01:13:46.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you talk to anyone else while the show's going on?

01:13:46.753 --> 01:13:46.913
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:13:48.713 --> 01:13:51.134
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking to Drew, but now I'm done.

01:13:51.474 --> 01:13:52.234
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking to Drew?

01:13:52.254 --> 01:13:56.636
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was IMing him with my phone, but now I signed out because it's too hard to text IM.

01:13:57.574 --> 01:14:00.575
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are sitting literally mere feet away from each other.

01:14:00.615 --> 01:14:01.795
[SPEAKER_03]: You could write on a paper.

01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:07.097
[SPEAKER_05]: We did this the other night because I said something to her on Twitter.

01:14:08.198 --> 01:14:11.219
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was like, wait, she's right behind me.

01:14:12.339 --> 01:14:17.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, and I guess I'll say this now, I was going to kind of leave it a secret until we come back from vacation and I actually have it hung up.

01:14:18.361 --> 01:14:22.242
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the studio got a new present this week thanks to...

01:14:24.219 --> 01:14:24.799
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com

01:14:47.344 --> 01:14:47.884
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:19.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, QGames, I'm talking on the PlayStation blog this week about some games that are coming out in 2009.

01:15:19.477 --> 01:15:20.979
[SPEAKER_03]: They are pixel junk titles.

01:15:21.339 --> 01:15:23.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Two or three of them apparently are coming out this year.

01:15:24.223 --> 01:15:25.205
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them has already come out.

01:15:25.225 --> 01:15:27.147
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Pixel Junk Monsters for the PSP.

01:15:27.548 --> 01:15:29.831
[SPEAKER_03]: However, who knows what the others could be.

01:15:30.251 --> 01:15:36.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know, if you believe what you've seen on Spike TV lately, there was skiing, fighting, and so on.

01:15:36.773 --> 01:15:42.895
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can probably imagine there's going to be a pixel junk about some other type of genre you've probably already seen before.

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:49.437
[SPEAKER_03]: But, of course, one of the last games we got from them was Pixel Junk Eden, which was kind of like random.

01:15:49.657 --> 01:15:51.278
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows what it's going to be.

01:15:51.898 --> 01:15:57.320
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not play this series an awful lot, but I know it's one of the few exclusive series they've got going on right now, right, Loki?

01:15:58.767 --> 01:15:59.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one now?

01:15:59.587 --> 01:16:00.128
[SPEAKER_03]: PixelJunk?

01:16:00.588 --> 01:16:03.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is one exclusive series that they have going on.

01:16:03.389 --> 01:16:04.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever played it?

01:16:04.209 --> 01:16:06.511
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not played these games personally, so I don't know a whole lot about it.

01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:09.712
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there was another one, like a PixelJunk racer game as well.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:10.652
[SPEAKER_04]: There might, I think there is.

01:16:10.712 --> 01:16:10.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:13.730
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:14.871
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really touched any of them.

01:16:14.911 --> 01:16:24.198
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, lately, up until about a couple weeks ago, I didn't realize that I couldn't just spend the exact amount on the PlayStation Network for things.

01:16:24.658 --> 01:16:27.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I still don't see myself playing a lot of stuff on the PlayStation 3.

01:16:29.822 --> 01:16:37.488
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little hesitant to buy stuff like PixelJunk games just because I have so many Xbox Live Arcade games that I don't play.

01:16:37.908 --> 01:16:38.349
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:41.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hear you.

01:16:42.318 --> 01:16:44.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, just thought I'd check.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

01:16:49.383 --> 01:16:49.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

01:16:51.503 --> 01:16:56.487
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is, I guess, a matter of debate for several people.

01:16:57.267 --> 01:17:04.252
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying that collectible games are losing their value because of digital re-releases.

01:17:05.973 --> 01:17:15.480
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially if you go look on eBay for a lot of these titles, people are just not getting the money that they used to be able to get for them.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:31.554
[SPEAKER_05]: um for example um uh Ikaruga um was uh $75 for the Dreamcast version $45 for the GameCube version um when they both came out on Xbox Live Arcade uh the games went to $5 to $15 um

01:17:36.132 --> 01:17:42.137
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, I honestly, I'm not really, I don't really care that much.

01:17:42.597 --> 01:17:43.658
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good news for me.

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.640
[SPEAKER_03]: You collect a lot of video games.

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.442
[SPEAKER_03]: You have some obscure fucking shit in your house.

01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:50.064
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody's going to be pissed off, I'd imagine you'd be.

01:17:51.443 --> 01:17:52.905
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:18:11.425 --> 01:18:11.845
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:39.602
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really care so much about them being re-released because the whole reason... Now, I was kind of giddy for a little while about my version about having Dracula X when, ooh, $300, I got it for $100, ooh.

01:18:40.743 --> 01:18:46.665
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was like, but really, the whole reason I wanted the game was to play it because it's a fun game.

01:18:47.506 --> 01:18:55.389
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's being re-released, that means that, you know, more people can actually get a chance to play the fun shit that I have.

01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:56.950
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Suikoden this week.

01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:57.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Castlevania Chronicles.

01:18:57.931 --> 01:18:59.772
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really give a crap about Suikoden.

01:18:59.912 --> 01:19:00.153
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

01:19:00.173 --> 01:19:00.873
[SPEAKER_03]: Castlevania Chronicles?

01:19:01.434 --> 01:19:01.694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:02.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:19:03.335 --> 01:19:06.798
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, it's a game.

01:19:07.839 --> 01:19:10.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Why shouldn't they re-release it, especially if they know people love it?

01:19:11.582 --> 01:19:13.823
[SPEAKER_05]: Why shouldn't they try to make money off of old franchises?

01:19:13.863 --> 01:19:14.484
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

01:19:16.205 --> 01:19:17.266
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no problem with it.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though, ooh, you're not special anymore.

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:20.429
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

01:19:20.649 --> 01:19:20.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

01:19:22.608 --> 01:19:23.028
[SPEAKER_05]: www.DarkSakura.com

01:19:39.255 --> 01:19:45.000
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fit every Atari 2600 cartridge ever made onto one CD, probably.

01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:52.487
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's still kind of cool when you actually see an Atari 2600 system and you actually see the cartridge for Sword Quest.

01:19:52.527 --> 01:19:54.289
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like, oh cool, I remember this game.

01:19:54.369 --> 01:19:57.932
[SPEAKER_05]: We hook up our nests and blow in the thing all the time just to, you know...

01:19:59.338 --> 01:20:00.139
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing.

01:20:01.401 --> 01:20:06.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you could probably fit every single Atari 2600 cartridge onto one PlayStation 2 memory card.

01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:08.571
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably, I wouldn't doubt it.

01:20:08.672 --> 01:20:10.094
[SPEAKER_04]: It's six megs for all the ROMs.

01:20:10.614 --> 01:20:11.556
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ask me how I know that.

01:20:13.258 --> 01:20:13.839
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know?

01:20:13.959 --> 01:20:14.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

01:20:15.146 --> 01:20:19.250
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at any rate, it's a difference in experience.

01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:23.154
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play the game, or you could go back on the system.

01:20:23.474 --> 01:20:32.182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I had a big problem with emulation for a little while, and it wasn't that I had a problem with people ripping games and emulating them and this, that, and the other.

01:20:32.603 --> 01:20:39.710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fact that I really wanted to have the original game so that I could play it on my system and play the game the way...

01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:42.431
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people played the game, you know what I mean?

01:20:42.991 --> 01:20:43.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

01:20:43.671 --> 01:20:49.993
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's where I think the special part of it is, you know, is having it and playing it.

01:20:50.033 --> 01:20:53.253
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, if other people get to enjoy the game, I have no problem with it.

01:20:53.594 --> 01:20:59.235
[SPEAKER_05]: If it makes it cheaper for me to get those games that I want, by all means, you know.

01:20:59.395 --> 01:21:00.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's release more.

01:21:00.515 --> 01:21:04.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Now tell me, though, how many people have a Turbo Duo?

01:21:05.377 --> 01:21:05.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

01:21:07.865 --> 01:21:08.726
[SPEAKER_05]: That still works.

01:21:08.786 --> 01:21:09.106
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

01:21:09.606 --> 01:21:10.047
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

01:21:10.827 --> 01:21:11.588
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love it.

01:21:12.508 --> 01:21:13.209
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

01:21:13.549 --> 01:21:16.311
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone wanted to play my Turbo Duo, I would bring it over.

01:21:17.992 --> 01:21:22.975
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as their house wasn't, you know, covered in dust that went up to my knees.

01:21:23.715 --> 01:21:24.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

01:21:26.237 --> 01:21:27.538
[SPEAKER_05]: Your house is not that dusty.

01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:29.119
[SPEAKER_03]: My house?

01:21:29.659 --> 01:21:31.180
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Andrew's over there making faces at me.

01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:32.221
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:35.417
[SPEAKER_04]: My car is very dusty.

01:21:35.517 --> 01:21:36.997
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably dustier than your house.

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:41.439
[SPEAKER_03]: My PlayStation 3 is really dusty except in the area where the eject button and the power button is.

01:21:41.919 --> 01:21:42.939
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a dust magnet.

01:21:43.039 --> 01:21:43.980
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.900
[SPEAKER_05]: If I didn't dust ours, it'd be like that.

01:21:46.241 --> 01:21:47.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:59.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, Collectors, swap meets are your friends.

01:21:59.678 --> 01:22:01.559
[SPEAKER_03]: I speak for my friends' experience, and my own.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:05.983
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, have you had a lot of luck at swap meets, DarkSakra, in your collecting?

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:07.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Every so often.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:07.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

01:22:08.484 --> 01:22:08.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

01:22:09.465 --> 01:22:09.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:10.426
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

01:22:11.672 --> 01:22:18.836
[SPEAKER_04]: I know when Mega Man 9 came out earlier this year, it was pretty much the retro gamers kind of dream game.

01:22:19.537 --> 01:22:23.540
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially a perfect release for the Mega Man series.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:27.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of going back to the roots of the earlier Mega Man games.

01:22:27.682 --> 01:22:29.584
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it almost wasn't the case.

01:22:30.584 --> 01:22:33.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, 1UP did an interview with the producer of Mega Man 9.

01:22:34.687 --> 01:22:38.810
[SPEAKER_04]: And said they had heard a bunch of... They were...

01:22:40.216 --> 01:22:50.981
[SPEAKER_04]: The management of Capcom was actually talking about doing a 3D Mega Man game for Mega Man 9 instead, which is interesting.

01:22:52.441 --> 01:22:54.882
[SPEAKER_04]: They had heard lots of negative responses.

01:22:54.922 --> 01:23:03.286
[SPEAKER_04]: They thought that it would be better to make it 3D and that the 8-bit style would only appeal to Mega Man fans, which would limit the sales potential.

01:23:04.701 --> 01:23:07.202
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:23:34.656 --> 01:23:34.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man 10

01:24:02.907 --> 01:24:03.227
[SPEAKER_04]: Someday.

01:24:04.528 --> 01:24:05.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday.

01:24:05.309 --> 01:24:06.610
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Mega Man 9 did really well.

01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:09.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Or will they just call it Mega Man X and then really confuse us?

01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:13.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, there's Mega Man 10 and now Mega Man X. It's too confusing.

01:24:13.694 --> 01:24:14.355
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Mega Man 9 2?

01:24:15.616 --> 01:24:17.877
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens when they get to Mega Man X 10?

01:24:20.139 --> 01:24:20.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Too crazy.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:23.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man Triple X. Oh yeah.

01:24:24.262 --> 01:24:24.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

01:24:24.802 --> 01:24:26.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that already fan fiction?

01:24:26.023 --> 01:24:27.043
[SPEAKER_03]: The love robots.

01:24:29.005 --> 01:24:31.027
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to kill Cockman and Boob Woman.

01:24:35.431 --> 01:24:37.372
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hear the show going down the toilet.

01:24:37.392 --> 01:24:42.557
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be that time for... Stupid Award!

01:24:44.673 --> 01:24:47.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Mirror Mirror on the wall, who's the stupidest of them all?

01:24:47.274 --> 01:24:53.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Well this week, it is a 17 year old, and so therefore we don't know their name because it's some dumb kid.

01:24:54.176 --> 01:25:00.857
[SPEAKER_03]: And this 17 year old lives in Ohio, and what he did this week, he threatened to commit suicide on an internet video game.

01:25:00.957 --> 01:25:01.457
[SPEAKER_03]: What game?

01:25:02.098 --> 01:25:03.278
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft.

01:25:03.905 --> 01:25:13.550
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, he paged a GM in World of Warcraft and told the GM that he was suicidal, that the game is the only thing that he has to live for.

01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:18.412
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might think, gee, Rob, that's pretty harsh of you to give somebody who's suicidal a stupid award.

01:25:18.832 --> 01:25:20.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the whole thing.

01:25:20.933 --> 01:25:21.633
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a joke.

01:25:22.374 --> 01:25:27.776
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid did it as a joke, quote, to try and get what he wanted for the game.

01:25:29.577 --> 01:25:30.358
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words...

01:25:31.305 --> 01:25:31.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:25:50.632 --> 01:25:52.494
[SPEAKER_03]: The questions being asked, where in Ohio?

01:25:52.534 --> 01:25:54.396
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're like, oh God, is this in my town?

01:25:55.357 --> 01:25:59.381
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Middletown, because it's being from the Middletown Journal.

01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:00.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, it's Fairfield.

01:26:01.603 --> 01:26:02.785
[SPEAKER_13]: Fairfield Township.

01:26:02.985 --> 01:26:03.986
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you talking about?

01:26:05.888 --> 01:26:06.268
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean?

01:26:06.288 --> 01:26:09.470
[SPEAKER_13]: There are no sympathetic employees.

01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:13.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the one GM I talked to one time was really nice.

01:26:13.772 --> 01:26:16.533
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, you know, my character's name is kind of funny.

01:26:16.573 --> 01:26:18.514
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to repeat it, but I have a funny character name.

01:26:18.534 --> 01:26:20.635
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, salutations, and said my name.

01:26:21.016 --> 01:26:23.557
[SPEAKER_03]: And they even gave me a less than three, a little heart.

01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:25.458
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a standardized greeting.

01:26:26.939 --> 01:26:27.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:30.821
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a standardized greeting.

01:26:30.841 --> 01:26:31.881
[SPEAKER_13]: I talk to a lot of them.

01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:32.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

01:26:32.802 --> 01:26:35.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you like a tattletale or something?

01:26:36.232 --> 01:26:36.573
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God.

01:26:36.714 --> 01:26:38.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

01:26:38.158 --> 01:26:39.722
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

01:26:45.219 --> 01:26:50.140
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, anyway, by the way, just so you guys know, the kid was handcuffed and placed in a patrol car.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.881
[SPEAKER_03]: The boy was... Which Jamie is applauding.

01:26:54.401 --> 01:27:00.022
[SPEAKER_03]: The boy was then released to his father a little later, hopefully for some big spankings, even though he's 17.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:05.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow I don't think that would stop Jamie if it was her kid.

01:27:05.824 --> 01:27:06.044
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:27:06.504 --> 01:27:09.885
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were 17, if your 17-year-old did this, would you spank them?

01:27:10.065 --> 01:27:10.265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:27:12.959 --> 01:27:18.283
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the kid is going to appear in court on Tuesday the 6th, Butler County Juvenile Court.

01:27:21.685 --> 01:27:24.828
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it tells you practically where this kid lives in the story.

01:27:24.848 --> 01:27:25.548
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good.

01:27:26.289 --> 01:27:27.449
[SPEAKER_03]: You can probably figure out who it is.

01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:28.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say it.

01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:28.970
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too much.

01:27:30.271 --> 01:27:30.952
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Billy!

01:27:33.113 --> 01:27:36.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it's a first-degree misdemeanor, by the way, for that whole thing.

01:27:36.996 --> 01:27:41.779
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, as a Blizzard employee, props to them for taking all the claims seriously.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.300
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know...

01:27:42.780 --> 01:28:09.136
[SPEAKER_03]: you never know you know if you've ever dealt with suicidal people suicidal people they just want to talk to anyone that will listen and I could totally see that I bet Blizzard gets some of these that are legit and like really sad and all that so it kind of sucks that there's this one asshole kid who has to take the whole thing as a joke it's also in their best interest to keep their clients alive so that they can pay their monthly fees besides just that Loki I just want to say businesses like that or companies like that do take things like that seriously um

01:28:10.006 --> 01:28:10.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:32.034
[SPEAKER_07]: He denied everything because she called the police because she was worried about him.

01:28:32.074 --> 01:28:33.496
[SPEAKER_07]: She had all the text messages.

01:28:33.556 --> 01:28:37.559
[SPEAKER_07]: They had phone records from all the calls and everything.

01:28:37.619 --> 01:28:39.461
[SPEAKER_07]: And he got dragged off to the funny farm.

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:41.222
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could have happened to that kid.

01:28:41.242 --> 01:28:48.208
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have said, well, if he's going to commit suicide, let's call the police and have them take him to a mental institution for an evaluation.

01:28:48.869 --> 01:28:50.831
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not sure if that's better or worse than jail.

01:28:50.911 --> 01:28:54.334
[SPEAKER_07]: But long story short, don't be stupid and do things like that.

01:28:55.339 --> 01:28:55.719
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

01:28:56.239 --> 01:29:02.562
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a 17-year-old should have had The Boy Who Cried Wolf read to him when he was, you know, five or younger.

01:29:03.442 --> 01:29:03.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

01:29:05.743 --> 01:29:06.203
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

01:29:06.443 --> 01:29:09.344
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a quest that should be in World of Warcraft.

01:29:10.125 --> 01:29:13.226
[SPEAKER_04]: They like parodying, you know, old fairy tales.

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:16.437
[SPEAKER_03]: They do like to parody a lot of stuff.

01:29:16.757 --> 01:29:19.721
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a parody of PETA in the game, which I thought was really funny.

01:29:20.181 --> 01:29:26.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you get the blood of animals on you and then you try to run through this little encampment, they'll all try to kill you and call you names.

01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:27.551
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of funny.

01:29:28.512 --> 01:29:28.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

01:29:29.493 --> 01:29:31.996
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think that they would want to throw blood on you, you know.

01:29:33.097 --> 01:29:33.637
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

01:29:56.232 --> 01:29:58.599
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've only got three emails.

01:29:59.482 --> 01:30:03.834
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is from Cheeseburger.

01:30:05.225 --> 01:30:06.266
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, OLR.

01:30:06.346 --> 01:30:14.171
[SPEAKER_05]: About a year ago, while I was doing my math homework, I was listening to your wonderful show when my math book pushed the PSP off the table and broke the screen.

01:30:14.912 --> 01:30:20.115
[SPEAKER_05]: I called Sony, and even when it was still under extended warranty, they wanted $90 to fix it.

01:30:20.395 --> 01:30:24.398
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I thought, screw that, Sony, and my PSP gathered dust for over a year.

01:30:24.558 --> 01:30:26.960
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I discovered the magic of eBay and got a new screen.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.781
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like buying a new PSP all over again.

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:34.965
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question to you guys, and girls, is what games or UMD movies do you recommend?

01:30:36.326 --> 01:30:42.531
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like sports games, but I do like RPGs, MMOs, FPSs, anything else that uses an acronym.

01:30:42.671 --> 01:30:43.091
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

01:30:43.572 --> 01:30:44.012
[SPEAKER_05]: That was me.

01:30:45.413 --> 01:30:46.854
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you guys like, pretty much.

01:30:47.335 --> 01:30:50.437
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have a few movies in one game, Medal of Honor Heroes.

01:30:50.998 --> 01:30:52.859
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and it's a PSP FAT.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:57.083
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, my DS has been gathering dust for longer than that, and it's working fine.

01:30:57.523 --> 01:30:58.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Any games worth checking out on that?

01:31:00.045 --> 01:31:01.786
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Yeah.

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:04.529
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, for PSP, um...

01:31:05.635 --> 01:31:07.057
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 1 and 2 for sure.

01:31:07.077 --> 01:31:09.580
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like RPGs, those are pretty awesome remakes.

01:31:11.062 --> 01:31:15.688
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also the Metal Gear games that came out on that.

01:31:15.808 --> 01:31:19.473
[SPEAKER_05]: The interesting little card games that they were.

01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:22.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Catapult is kind of fun if you like little music games like that.

01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:23.592
[SPEAKER_05]: Every Extend Extra?

01:31:24.272 --> 01:31:25.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Q games are fun.

01:31:25.192 --> 01:31:26.273
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, check out your copy again.

01:31:26.453 --> 01:31:27.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God, bring it back.

01:31:28.273 --> 01:31:35.816
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like Space Invaders Extreme was fun too, but I like those like music-y type games.

01:31:36.337 --> 01:31:39.298
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as UMDs, if you can freaking find any, good luck.

01:31:39.518 --> 01:31:42.879
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, whatever movies you like, dude, don't let me tell you what movies you like.

01:31:42.899 --> 01:31:44.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're kind of hard to find, so good luck with that.

01:31:45.576 --> 01:31:49.278
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as DS goes, definitely in Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.

01:31:51.599 --> 01:31:52.360
[SPEAKER_05]: Cooking Mama 2.

01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:55.801
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Dracula X Chronicles.

01:31:55.881 --> 01:31:56.922
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for PSP.

01:31:57.742 --> 01:31:58.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 4.

01:31:58.283 --> 01:32:00.364
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to be a Final Fantasy whore, why not?

01:32:01.624 --> 01:32:06.107
[SPEAKER_05]: Chrono Trigger is out on DS.

01:32:07.387 --> 01:32:08.888
[SPEAKER_05]: Animal Crossing, there's that.

01:32:09.208 --> 01:32:12.550
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom is recommending DJ Max if you're a music fan for PSP.

01:32:14.252 --> 01:32:15.035
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

01:32:15.135 --> 01:32:17.462
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look online.

01:32:18.565 --> 01:32:19.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

01:32:20.023 --> 01:32:20.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email?

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:21.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:32:22.545 --> 01:32:24.467
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear OLR, first of all, Happy New Year.

01:32:24.987 --> 01:32:28.490
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's to the year not resembling the intake valve of a commercial air compressor.

01:32:29.611 --> 01:32:33.354
[SPEAKER_05]: By that, I mean I hope it does not suck nor seem designed to do just that.

01:32:34.335 --> 01:32:37.838
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, to all the Doctor Who fans in the OLR army, here's an article of interest.

01:32:38.378 --> 01:32:42.401
[SPEAKER_05]: New Doctor is the youngest ever, and yes, I have seen this.

01:32:44.923 --> 01:32:46.725
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Doctor is Tom Green.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Green is the new Doctor

01:33:07.157 --> 01:33:13.281
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, uh, they've, if I'm right, they've actually already started filming for the 2009 series.

01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:17.343
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, oh well, I don't know too much about him.

01:33:17.403 --> 01:33:25.168
[SPEAKER_05]: If, if any of our, uh, listeners overseas know more about this guy, um, send me some of his stuff so I can see what it is.

01:33:26.248 --> 01:33:32.652
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, um, it says, uh, thank you for your time, Hunter Red, Redertainment.

01:33:33.072 --> 01:33:35.113
[SPEAKER_05]: This message is brought to you by Zap Attack.

01:33:35.253 --> 01:33:36.194
[SPEAKER_05]: Insert cheat plug here.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.564
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some Dr. Eleven hate going on in chat.

01:33:40.884 --> 01:33:43.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad from PodCulture says the casting for Dr. Eleven sucks.

01:33:45.131 --> 01:33:46.173
[SPEAKER_05]: I am saying this.

01:33:47.596 --> 01:33:49.439
[SPEAKER_05]: As much of a 10 fan girl I am,

01:33:51.465 --> 01:33:53.807
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to give the guy a chance.

01:33:54.668 --> 01:33:59.733
[SPEAKER_05]: The only doctor who was ever an awful doctor was the sixth doctor.

01:34:01.074 --> 01:34:02.155
[SPEAKER_05]: He was scary.

01:34:03.416 --> 01:34:09.842
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, my favorite doctor to date is still the fourth doctor, as much as I love ten.

01:34:10.342 --> 01:34:13.645
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also sort of see that dividing line between series.

01:34:15.067 --> 01:34:16.168
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't even talk about the movie.

01:34:17.867 --> 01:34:20.328
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, we need to give the guy a chance?

01:34:20.568 --> 01:34:21.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him a chance.

01:34:21.208 --> 01:34:23.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give him one episode to make it good?

01:34:23.989 --> 01:34:24.849
[SPEAKER_05]: Give him the season.

01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.610
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:27.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Give the guy a chance.

01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:30.131
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know until you see them in.

01:34:31.652 --> 01:34:37.754
[SPEAKER_03]: All we are saying, give Matt Smith a chance.

01:34:38.968 --> 01:34:45.874
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's just my point is you really aren't going to know until you watch it with an open mind.

01:34:45.974 --> 01:34:51.859
[SPEAKER_05]: If you watch it expecting him to suck, if you watch it looking for all the faults, you're going to see them.

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:58.625
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to enjoy yourself because you're going to be too busy sucking your... He's not David Tennant!

01:34:59.306 --> 01:35:00.126
[SPEAKER_05]: And I whined.

01:35:00.306 --> 01:35:00.887
[SPEAKER_05]: I did whine.

01:35:01.307 --> 01:35:02.368
[SPEAKER_05]: My first day I whined.

01:35:03.389 --> 01:35:06.612
[SPEAKER_05]: But my opinion is sit back and watch.

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:12.207
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to watch anyways because at some point soon Patrick Stewart will be guest starring.

01:35:13.188 --> 01:35:16.531
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's definitely worthwhile.

01:35:16.571 --> 01:35:20.315
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's probably during one of the filler specials next year.

01:35:21.923 --> 01:35:23.364
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:35:46.776 --> 01:35:49.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami is suggesting Loki as the 13th Doctor.

01:35:49.419 --> 01:35:51.621
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that will work because he's not very British.

01:35:51.641 --> 01:35:52.542
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a Doctor Who fan.

01:35:52.982 --> 01:35:53.843
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not very British.

01:35:56.146 --> 01:36:01.091
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I'm understanding, the episode with Patrick Stewart on it is actually going to be an actual episode.

01:36:01.831 --> 01:36:04.074
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's during David Tennant's run still.

01:36:04.414 --> 01:36:06.696
[SPEAKER_04]: They should just do Simon Pegg as the next Doctor.

01:36:06.896 --> 01:36:09.359
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon Pegg has already been in an episode of Doctor Who.

01:36:09.946 --> 01:36:11.087
[SPEAKER_04]: But not as the Doctor.

01:36:11.287 --> 01:36:25.954
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but he's been in an episode, and they're... I would love Simon Pegg as the Doctor, but they are very... They're very continuity conscious.

01:36:26.451 --> 01:36:30.473
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of Doctor Who being a woman, or it was Catherine Zeta-Jones.

01:36:30.953 --> 01:36:32.594
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, I mean, she sold T-Mobile.

01:36:32.814 --> 01:36:33.475
[SPEAKER_03]: She could sell a TARDIS.

01:36:33.495 --> 01:36:41.099
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I wish, and sorry, spoilers, who cares, if Donna took over as the Doctor.

01:36:41.499 --> 01:36:43.460
[SPEAKER_04]: John Cleese is the next Doctor.

01:36:44.961 --> 01:36:54.446
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, now I need to see Doctor Who in The Curse of the Fatal Death, which was Rowan Atkinson playing the Doctor.

01:36:55.296 --> 01:36:58.217
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I need to, you know who they should cast as the Doctor?

01:36:58.337 --> 01:36:58.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Benny Hill.

01:37:01.318 --> 01:37:03.839
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't he dead?

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:05.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Exhume him.

01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:08.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Benny Hill dead?

01:37:08.701 --> 01:37:09.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

01:37:10.282 --> 01:37:12.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Bono is the next Doctor Who.

01:37:13.283 --> 01:37:15.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got me all curious if Benny Hill is dead or not.

01:37:15.404 --> 01:37:16.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, he is?

01:37:16.944 --> 01:37:18.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, he died some time ago, I think.

01:37:18.705 --> 01:37:19.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take our word for it.

01:37:20.266 --> 01:37:23.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, make it like a weekend at Bernie's thing.

01:37:24.912 --> 01:37:25.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

01:37:25.752 --> 01:37:26.833
[SPEAKER_03]: This show's getting depressing.

01:37:28.173 --> 01:37:31.414
[SPEAKER_05]: So, moving on to the last email.

01:37:31.634 --> 01:37:32.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Christ, he died in 1992.

01:37:32.534 --> 01:37:38.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is Horson's Radio bringing you the late breaking news?

01:37:39.256 --> 01:37:40.677
[SPEAKER_02]: Benny Hill just died.

01:37:41.057 --> 01:37:42.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Today is a tragic day.

01:37:46.439 --> 01:37:46.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

01:37:47.199 --> 01:37:47.679
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:37:48.059 --> 01:37:48.899
[SPEAKER_05]: You make me weep.

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:50.960
[SPEAKER_05]: In my heart.

01:37:52.779 --> 01:37:54.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I hadn't seen the guy in a while.

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.101
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of figured he was probably old and dead.

01:37:57.141 --> 01:37:58.301
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, forget it.

01:37:58.541 --> 01:38:00.902
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there's people I haven't seen in a while.

01:38:01.282 --> 01:38:02.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're old and dead.

01:38:05.043 --> 01:38:06.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

01:38:06.164 --> 01:38:09.165
[SPEAKER_05]: When was the last time you saw Molly Ringwald on TV?

01:38:09.185 --> 01:38:11.466
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen my mother in a while.

01:38:11.486 --> 01:38:13.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I saw her on TV the other day.

01:38:13.326 --> 01:38:14.387
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's not old and dead.

01:38:14.407 --> 01:38:18.688
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife watches a lot of ABC Family and Lifetime.

01:38:18.828 --> 01:38:20.349
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what about Ally Sheedy?

01:38:21.476 --> 01:38:22.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's Ally Sheedy?

01:38:23.097 --> 01:38:24.459
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen my mother in a week.

01:38:24.799 --> 01:38:25.700
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope she's okay.

01:38:26.801 --> 01:38:27.962
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you see the Breakfast Club?

01:38:29.062 --> 01:38:30.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know any of their names.

01:38:30.303 --> 01:38:31.264
[SPEAKER_05]: She was the crazy girl.

01:38:32.525 --> 01:38:33.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but I don't know any of their names.

01:38:33.967 --> 01:38:35.588
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just people in the Breakfast Club.

01:38:36.789 --> 01:38:41.273
[SPEAKER_04]: VidPower in chat says, Rise from your grave, Benny Hill.

01:38:44.275 --> 01:38:46.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Raul Julia is the next Benny Hill.

01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:48.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim Curry's still alive.

01:38:48.751 --> 01:38:49.591
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim Curry's still doing stuff.

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:50.292
[SPEAKER_03]: He did spam a lot.

01:38:50.312 --> 01:38:50.852
[SPEAKER_03]: He will never die.

01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:51.933
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not old and dead yet.

01:38:51.993 --> 01:38:52.513
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just old.

01:38:53.534 --> 01:38:53.914
[SPEAKER_03]: And gay.

01:38:55.215 --> 01:38:55.615
And fat.

01:38:56.676 --> 01:38:57.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

01:38:57.696 --> 01:38:57.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:38:58.337 --> 01:38:58.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, guys.

01:38:58.937 --> 01:39:00.458
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question for Loki.

01:39:00.999 --> 01:39:01.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Loki.

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:03.840
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Alpha Cananogram.

01:39:04.241 --> 01:39:05.041
[SPEAKER_05]: Just curious.

01:39:05.522 --> 01:39:10.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I'm opening my PSP 2001 Slim and Light, comma, comma, comma.

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:39.143
[SPEAKER_05]: and I have stripped slash have almost stripped the head of one of the top two screws so now I can't try to fix my d-pad any suggestions on how to remove the screw or how to fix my d-pad it kept going either left or right and sometimes up or down sometimes if I barely touch right it'll go left this is the first period he's used in the sorry the second period he's using the entire email sorry y'all for the grammar really in the bad situation at the moment that's no excuse keep on going alpha canonogram

01:39:39.383 --> 01:39:39.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:40:04.173 --> 01:40:05.755
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:40:21.074 --> 01:40:49.919
[SPEAKER_04]: although you should be able to buy I think they actually sell some of the replacement screws online you can buy a kit of like all sorts of miscellaneous parts for the PSP so just buy that I replaced a shoulder button for one of my PSPs I think one time with a kit similar to that so that'd be the best way to go oh and none of those face plates the clear ones ever seem to fit properly which sucks because I remember trying to put some of those on too

01:40:51.906 --> 01:40:56.349
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD in chat is trying to say that since I haven't been on TV in a while, I'm old and dead.

01:40:56.929 --> 01:40:58.190
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm young and fabulous.

01:40:58.330 --> 01:40:59.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell him that he's wrong.

01:41:00.532 --> 01:41:01.432
[SPEAKER_03]: WRONG!

01:41:02.813 --> 01:41:07.496
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Ranma's trying to piggyback on top of that saying, of course, Sky would have the rainbow-colored coffin.

01:41:08.016 --> 01:41:09.718
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking, they have those?

01:41:11.499 --> 01:41:14.341
[SPEAKER_07]: If there is such a thing, Elton John's got one reserved.

01:41:14.561 --> 01:41:14.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:41:16.962 --> 01:41:19.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, all I ask... This is a platform coffin.

01:41:20.384 --> 01:41:21.065
[SPEAKER_03]: All I ask...

01:41:23.627 --> 01:41:26.129
[SPEAKER_03]: All I ask is to be buried with my ABBA albums.

01:41:26.169 --> 01:41:27.210
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I ask.

01:41:31.093 --> 01:41:31.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

01:41:32.254 --> 01:41:36.737
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean the one ABBA album that you have that lives at my house that we haven't given you yet?

01:41:37.998 --> 01:41:39.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Actual album, yeah.

01:41:39.519 --> 01:41:40.660
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring it over.

01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:42.401
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it.

01:41:42.421 --> 01:41:43.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me my ABBA.

01:41:43.842 --> 01:41:44.703
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Super Trooper.

01:41:45.223 --> 01:41:46.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Trooper.

01:41:47.225 --> 01:41:48.206
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more emails?

01:41:51.969 --> 01:41:52.309
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:57.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

01:41:58.234 --> 01:42:07.101
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I think we're to that part of the show where maybe, just maybe, it's about time that we give something away.

01:42:08.662 --> 01:42:12.125
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do the match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:12.205 --> 01:42:12.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

01:42:23.419 --> 01:42:24.101
[SPEAKER_03]: I skipped ahead.

01:42:24.181 --> 01:42:24.803
[SPEAKER_03]: False alarm.

01:42:24.843 --> 01:42:26.948
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to the match game in just a little bit.

01:42:28.612 --> 01:42:29.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio.

01:42:29.354 --> 01:42:30.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that an ultimate tease?

01:42:33.619 --> 01:42:57.065
[SPEAKER_04]: i'm like no we're not i might want to edit that later if i remember we'll see let's we'll pretend it didn't happen we'll just pretend that didn't happen let's move on with some more gaming stories all right um well speaking of how the playstation 3 you know was uber awesome in internet browsing well the playstation 3 has been used to um break the internet as well in fact

01:42:57.505 --> 01:43:09.975
[SPEAKER_04]: A cluster of PlayStation 3s, 200 to be exact, linked together were able to do the math to help decrypt the MD5 hash used in Verisign.

01:43:10.015 --> 01:43:20.284
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, if you have 200 PS3s lying around linked together, you too can crack supposedly uncrackable encryption.

01:43:21.384 --> 01:43:21.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurrah.

01:43:24.212 --> 01:43:34.117
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not really worried though that anybody's going to crack this other than obviously this research team because really who's sitting on 200 PS3s other than Sony?

01:43:37.938 --> 01:43:38.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody.

01:43:38.839 --> 01:43:39.219
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody.

01:43:40.459 --> 01:43:42.120
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all those other research labs, remember?

01:43:44.041 --> 01:43:47.323
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that are actually trying to cure cancer.

01:43:47.343 --> 01:43:48.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my PS3 cures cancer.

01:43:49.544 --> 01:43:50.004
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

01:43:51.055 --> 01:43:56.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, I can't buy PS3 games at airports yet, but now you can buy... Well, I guess I might.

01:43:56.598 --> 01:43:58.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on the airport, I actually probably could.

01:43:58.519 --> 01:44:04.362
[SPEAKER_03]: But now you can buy a Nintendo DS and DS games in airports out of a vending machine.

01:44:04.862 --> 01:44:06.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, these vending machines are pretty high-end.

01:44:06.883 --> 01:44:12.045
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I guess we've seen these types of vending machines before that have kind of the really uber-expensive stuff.

01:44:12.065 --> 01:44:13.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know they're in Vegas.

01:44:13.166 --> 01:44:13.966
[SPEAKER_03]: You see them, right?

01:44:14.006 --> 01:44:15.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you see these things in Vegas?

01:44:15.207 --> 01:44:16.768
[SPEAKER_03]: Casinos and stuff with, like, iPods and...

01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:17.568
[SPEAKER_03]: All that stuff.

01:44:17.868 --> 01:44:24.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now they have these fancy vending machines with expensive DS games and Nintendo DSs in them.

01:44:26.710 --> 01:44:32.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, it's something that Best Buy is doing, and it's a Best Buy Express vending machine.

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:35.955
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are at a couple of the different airports throughout the U.S.

01:44:36.575 --> 01:44:42.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only, though, should I point out that they sell the DS and DS games, they sell headphones, chargers, and so on.

01:44:43.399 --> 01:44:49.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I want to point out, though, that if you've ever flown before, you'll know you actually don't want to use the DS, though, during landing and takeoff.

01:44:49.042 --> 01:44:49.402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad.

01:44:50.697 --> 01:44:51.637
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could crash the plane.

01:44:51.878 --> 01:44:54.499
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really, but they'd get really angry at you when you do that.

01:44:54.559 --> 01:44:56.420
[SPEAKER_03]: So only use it when it's safe.

01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:59.961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of neat that they have these sort of kiosks.

01:45:00.101 --> 01:45:01.862
[SPEAKER_04]: We did see one for Sony and stuff.

01:45:02.623 --> 01:45:08.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, there's also a chain of stores called... Oh gosh, now I can't remember what the name is.

01:45:08.525 --> 01:45:09.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Airtunes, right?

01:45:09.866 --> 01:45:11.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Airtunes, but it's...

01:45:13.058 --> 01:45:13.738
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember their call.

01:45:13.758 --> 01:45:19.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, but they have a chain that's in every single airport that's out there right now, and they also sell the exact same stuff.

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:29.363
[SPEAKER_04]: And in case you're worried about putting in your credit card and spending hundreds of dollars on DS systems and stuff like that, and possibly getting stuck in this...

01:45:31.184 --> 01:45:31.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Vending Machine.

01:45:31.865 --> 01:45:32.765
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was going to say.

01:45:32.805 --> 01:45:36.027
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if the little thing turns and it doesn't fall out?

01:45:36.348 --> 01:45:39.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine me sitting there shaking this vending machine with $100 worth of merchandise?

01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:41.831
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's alarms on it and all.

01:45:42.071 --> 01:45:48.616
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can actually go to the store and purchase these games face-to-face with people.

01:45:48.716 --> 01:45:53.519
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really see the point of why they have this in there other than another place you can buy the same shit.

01:45:53.899 --> 01:45:54.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Impulse Buy.

01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:56.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Mommy, I want one.

01:45:56.381 --> 01:45:57.221
[SPEAKER_03]: Gimme, gimme, gimme.

01:45:58.022 --> 01:45:58.202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:45:58.891 --> 01:46:00.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Leo Shen calls it a super plane crasher DS.

01:46:01.832 --> 01:46:07.354
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf says, now, do the DS's come already charged or do you have to charge it in the airport before you get on the plane?

01:46:07.915 --> 01:46:10.936
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ranma says his did come charged already.

01:46:11.436 --> 01:46:13.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't the DS's come charged?

01:46:13.837 --> 01:46:18.379
[SPEAKER_04]: From what I remember, my original DS and I think my DS Lite, I think I had to charge both of those.

01:46:18.459 --> 01:46:18.759
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you?

01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.640
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks for them.

01:46:22.677 --> 01:46:25.420
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because then how do you charge them before you get on the plane?

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, then, you know, airports, it's really easy to charge a laptop at an airport.

01:46:29.724 --> 01:46:30.865
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plugs everywhere.

01:46:30.885 --> 01:46:32.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you may not have the convenience or time to do that.

01:46:32.826 --> 01:46:38.432
[SPEAKER_04]: And better yet, I mean, really, do you really want to buy electronics at an airport?

01:46:38.492 --> 01:46:45.098
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can understand a game, you know, I bought headphones because my headphones sucked because I had these stupid earbuds and I wanted something different, but...

01:46:46.667 --> 01:46:47.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

01:46:47.307 --> 01:46:48.428
[SPEAKER_04]: A DS system?

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:51.889
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, hey, you know, I really wish I had DS.

01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:54.209
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is more for like gifts and stuff like that.

01:46:54.269 --> 01:47:02.112
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, crap, I gotta get my son a gift and I am stupid and didn't think about getting him anything.

01:47:02.232 --> 01:47:03.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, look, a vending machine.

01:47:03.793 --> 01:47:05.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me buy some useless crap.

01:47:08.294 --> 01:47:12.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, problem is they don't sell porn in the airport, and that's very sad.

01:47:12.256 --> 01:47:14.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because, you know, you shouldn't be looking at porn on a plane.

01:47:14.857 --> 01:47:17.738
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to crash a plane that does not interfere with their taking off or landing.

01:47:17.758 --> 01:47:19.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but there might be children sitting behind you.

01:47:19.879 --> 01:47:20.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Screw the children.

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:22.360
[SPEAKER_03]: No thank you.

01:47:22.901 --> 01:47:26.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're sitting in the very back row by yourself, then you can look at all the porn you want.

01:47:26.303 --> 01:47:27.003
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, wait, wait.

01:47:27.203 --> 01:47:30.385
[SPEAKER_13]: If they sell a PSP, you can look at porn on the PSP.

01:47:30.845 --> 01:47:32.726
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we all know the PSP is the gateway to porn.

01:47:32.907 --> 01:47:36.649
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't look at the internet while you're on a fucking airplane.

01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.230
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah!

01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:42.172
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can put pictures and encode videos onto your memory.

01:47:42.312 --> 01:47:43.413
[SPEAKER_04]: All at the airport?

01:47:44.513 --> 01:47:45.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, all at the airport.

01:47:46.214 --> 01:47:46.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

01:47:49.048 --> 01:47:56.374
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to go to that extreme lengths of trouble just to look at porn, why don't you just bring a Playboy on the goddamn plane?

01:47:56.394 --> 01:47:59.897
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else you could do, too, is use one of those TV devices that they had.

01:47:59.997 --> 01:48:02.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember those wonderful TV devices that they don't sell anymore?

01:48:03.259 --> 01:48:07.543
[SPEAKER_04]: They act like a projector and project it onto the ceiling of the cabin.

01:48:08.403 --> 01:48:09.244
[SPEAKER_04]: You have issues.

01:48:10.845 --> 01:48:11.166
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:48:13.367 --> 01:48:14.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on.

01:48:14.828 --> 01:48:18.011
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one more story before we get to match game tonight.

01:48:19.150 --> 01:48:21.251
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like Legos.

01:48:22.651 --> 01:48:23.851
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like Rock Band.

01:48:24.972 --> 01:48:29.013
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a rumor going around that those are two great tastes that taste great together.

01:48:31.313 --> 01:48:33.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Tastes great, less filling.

01:48:33.534 --> 01:48:40.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Tastes great, less... So yeah, the rumor is that there is going to be a Lego Rock Band.

01:48:41.684 --> 01:48:43.705
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I can say.

01:48:43.745 --> 01:48:46.307
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no confirmation.

01:48:47.447 --> 01:48:54.251
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a... Some dude's uncle works for LEGO and heard, right?

01:48:54.271 --> 01:48:58.114
[SPEAKER_05]: There's supposed to be a LEGO title coming out, but LEGO Rock Band?

01:48:58.194 --> 01:49:01.836
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, can't they find something?

01:49:01.856 --> 01:49:04.578
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's not the dumbest rumor I've ever heard.

01:49:04.598 --> 01:49:08.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't there a White Stripes video made completely out of LEGOs, if I remember right?

01:49:08.959 --> 01:49:13.441
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the only thing I could think of that could possibly tie into LEGO and Rock Band.

01:49:13.461 --> 01:49:14.302
[SPEAKER_03]: This is bunk.

01:49:15.142 --> 01:49:16.183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotta be bullshit.

01:49:16.243 --> 01:49:18.164
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know why this is completely bunk?

01:49:18.324 --> 01:49:21.526
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because you have to understand the way they make LEGO games.

01:49:22.106 --> 01:49:25.668
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, it's a specific chain of events.

01:49:26.248 --> 01:49:26.949
[SPEAKER_04]: You have...

01:49:27.878 --> 01:49:31.400
[SPEAKER_04]: The toy that they make first, then you make the video game.

01:49:32.721 --> 01:49:37.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like they've had... I believe they have the LEGO Indiana Jones toys.

01:49:37.164 --> 01:49:38.925
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they have the LEGO Star Wars toys.

01:49:39.686 --> 01:49:42.908
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that they have the LEGO Racer toys and stuff like that.

01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:52.935
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next logical step for me, and seeing as the rumor is EA is going to be publishing it, would be LEGO Harry Potter.

01:49:54.075 --> 01:49:54.876
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

01:49:56.743 --> 01:50:07.368
[SPEAKER_04]: They need another LEGO game and that makes perfect sense for me that they would be able to pump out two more LEGO games based around the Harry Potter movies and they already have toys to go along with it.

01:50:07.628 --> 01:50:17.593
[SPEAKER_04]: So Rock Band wouldn't make any sense at all because there's no reason for them to buy... Why would you even want to... I mean, you'd have to make special peripherals for it.

01:50:18.354 --> 01:50:20.995
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no LEGO-themed music to go along with it.

01:50:21.075 --> 01:50:23.136
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just be like a reskin of Rock Band.

01:50:25.666 --> 01:50:27.031
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be kind of crap.

01:50:27.633 --> 01:50:28.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Is what it would be.

01:50:28.456 --> 01:50:31.346
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be not kind of crap, it would be totally crap.

01:50:33.556 --> 01:50:36.457
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw is suggesting Lego Transformers would be another logical step.

01:50:37.057 --> 01:50:38.338
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, they don't have a toy for that.

01:50:38.358 --> 01:50:41.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, it's toy, then game.

01:50:41.979 --> 01:50:45.561
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, the game.

01:50:45.681 --> 01:50:51.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they're not going to just all of a sudden make, you know, Lego Halo or something like that.

01:50:51.503 --> 01:50:53.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they make Lego Halo toys first.

01:50:54.224 --> 01:50:59.406
[SPEAKER_04]: It's toy and game, because Lego's not going to just put their license out there unless they have something to benefit from it.

01:51:00.521 --> 01:51:02.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you know what this has started in the chat room.

01:51:02.742 --> 01:51:06.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have Frisbee says, Lego of Persia, Bricks of Time.

01:51:07.706 --> 01:51:10.307
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, Beatmania 2DX Legos.

01:51:11.188 --> 01:51:13.549
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, Imagine Legos.

01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:17.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, even though he's sitting right behind me, says Lego Crisis.

01:51:19.653 --> 01:51:25.297
[SPEAKER_03]: Lego International Superstar Soccer, Lego on a Prayer, Lego Sonic the Hedgehog, Little Big Legos.

01:51:28.337 --> 01:51:28.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

01:51:30.078 --> 01:51:32.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's a good question from Kazam.

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:33.260
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the Lego MMO?

01:51:33.781 --> 01:51:34.501
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

01:51:35.982 --> 01:51:37.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lego Radio?

01:51:39.204 --> 01:51:39.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, forget it.

01:51:39.805 --> 01:51:40.445
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooking Legos?

01:51:40.485 --> 01:51:41.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, forget it.

01:51:41.846 --> 01:51:42.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough.

01:51:42.967 --> 01:51:43.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.

01:51:44.108 --> 01:51:44.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock it off.

01:51:45.529 --> 01:51:47.670
[SPEAKER_03]: We have something much better to look forward to.

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:51.473
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now going to play the match game.

01:51:51.513 --> 01:51:51.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm sure.

01:51:51.973 --> 01:51:52.854
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play the match game.

01:51:54.192 --> 01:51:57.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight for the match game, we have five fabulous celebrities joining us in the studio.

01:51:58.035 --> 01:52:01.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to the one and only... Loki!

01:52:02.177 --> 01:52:02.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

[SPEAKER_04]: And to PodCulture in the... Or Brad from PodCulture.

01:52:08.702 --> 01:52:11.203
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no Lego Transformer toys.

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:14.826
[SPEAKER_04]: There are Transformer toys, but not Lego Transformer toys.

01:52:15.706 --> 01:52:16.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, whatever.

01:52:16.987 --> 01:52:20.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, say hello to Intern Drew, who is one of our other fabulous celebrity panelists tonight.

01:52:20.530 --> 01:52:20.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, what's up?

[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh...

01:52:23.967 --> 01:52:26.848

[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, also on the celebrity panel tonight, the most fabulous of them all, me.

01:52:47.134 --> 01:52:47.454
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

[SPEAKER_03]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 X-Link

01:53:18.716 --> 01:53:20.937
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm telling him to please stand by.

01:53:21.518 --> 01:53:34.249
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll need to explain the rules for match game while I open up the Skype line to the first person to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to play against X-Link for that $25 gift certificate.

01:53:34.269 --> 01:53:34.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:36.090
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:40.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody explain the rules of match game.

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:40.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurry.

01:53:41.715 --> 01:53:42.215
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

01:53:42.816 --> 01:53:44.097
[SPEAKER_05]: We're reading a bunch of crap.

01:53:45.455 --> 01:53:48.643
[SPEAKER_05]: And it ends, but it ends incomplete and you gotta complete it.

01:53:49.044 --> 01:53:49.966
[SPEAKER_05]: With a word.

01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Or phrase.

01:53:52.813 --> 01:53:53.335
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, go ahead.

01:53:55.202 --> 01:53:59.043
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if I said, I went to the blank, you'd have to pick.

01:53:59.063 --> 01:53:59.963
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:54:00.883 --> 01:54:04.624
[SPEAKER_03]: And X-Link just told me he has no idea how to play, so this should be fun tonight.

01:54:04.884 --> 01:54:08.005
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to try and match what we are thinking.

01:54:08.065 --> 01:54:09.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you gotta match what we are thinking.

01:54:09.845 --> 01:54:14.406
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna send you something with a blank in it, and you tell me over private message what you think should be in the blank.

01:54:15.947 --> 01:54:16.887
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and good luck.

01:54:17.327 --> 01:54:20.309
[SPEAKER_07]: Hurry up and go to YouTube and type in Match Game 76.

01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:21.390
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no time.

01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:23.051
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no time.

01:54:23.912 --> 01:54:25.233
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a caller on the Skype line.

01:54:25.273 --> 01:54:25.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, caller.

01:54:25.713 --> 01:54:26.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

01:54:26.974 --> 01:54:29.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Ranma, aka DJ Ranma.

01:54:30.116 --> 01:54:31.297
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to say it's rigged.

01:54:31.637 --> 01:54:32.598
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to say it's rigged.

01:54:32.618 --> 01:54:33.418
[SPEAKER_03]: No way.

01:54:33.438 --> 01:54:35.079
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just got mad skills.

01:54:35.119 --> 01:54:35.780
[SPEAKER_03]: He is mad.

01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:39.242
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fitting he should be our first phone contestant of the year.

01:54:39.362 --> 01:54:41.704
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a flaming finger when it comes to dialing.

01:54:42.324 --> 01:54:43.025
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

01:54:43.485 --> 01:54:43.705
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:54:43.725 --> 01:54:45.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Ranma, do you know how to play Match Game?

01:54:49.831 --> 01:54:51.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramma, do you know how to play match game?

01:54:51.972 --> 01:54:52.872
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, yes, I do.

01:54:53.012 --> 01:54:53.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, yes, you do.

01:54:53.913 --> 01:54:54.293
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:54:54.693 --> 01:54:56.234
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you explain to X-Link how to play?

01:54:59.195 --> 01:55:04.056
[SPEAKER_09]: Object... Damn it, I hosted a match game one time.

01:55:04.096 --> 01:55:04.817
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember.

01:55:04.917 --> 01:55:06.017
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:06.900
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:09.341
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill in the blank with what you think we're going to say.

01:55:09.401 --> 01:55:10.701
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best way we can explain it.

01:55:10.801 --> 01:55:11.862
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:55:12.402 --> 01:55:21.665
[SPEAKER_03]: So the winner tonight will get a $25 gift certificate to Amazon.com courtesy of Avengers Tower, your favorite giggling game girl blog.

01:55:21.685 --> 01:55:24.086
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I shouldn't keep saying that because then people are going to think that's really true.

01:55:24.126 --> 01:55:28.807
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually – it's irony because if you go read it, it's actually very well thought out and very well done.

01:55:28.887 --> 01:55:29.467
[SPEAKER_03]: It's irony.

01:55:29.507 --> 01:55:30.188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a case of irony.

01:55:31.388 --> 01:55:39.192
[SPEAKER_03]: and the loser tonight gets their face melted off with an Xbox 360 laser gun so don't lose alright, sound good Ranma?

01:55:39.933 --> 01:55:51.799
[SPEAKER_03]: works for me alright the whole chat room is yelling rigged, rigged do you have anything to say to the chat room before we begin tonight?

01:55:53.039 --> 01:55:55.861
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I can't help but have the fastest internet connection in the chat

01:55:56.653 --> 01:55:56.933
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:20.180
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, no, you're in the question.

01:56:20.601 --> 01:56:24.382
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, as you know, doesn't like to sing in front of people.

01:56:25.362 --> 01:56:27.983
[SPEAKER_03]: She snubs SingStar and laughs at lips.

01:56:28.903 --> 01:56:35.885
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole reason for this is that she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing For Your Blank.

01:56:41.647 --> 01:56:44.487
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game.

01:56:44.527 --> 01:56:46.048
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Sing For Your Blank.

01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:49.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone here in studio is trying to cook up an answer.

01:56:50.982 --> 01:56:53.103
[SPEAKER_03]: And just say ding when you're done so I know you have it.

01:56:55.565 --> 01:56:56.565
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura burped.

01:57:01.328 --> 01:57:01.908
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, ding.

01:57:02.088 --> 01:57:03.329
[SPEAKER_03]: I changed my answer at the last minute.

01:57:03.809 --> 01:57:04.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, ding.

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.810
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:05.590
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tiara?

01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:06.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Tiara, ding.

01:57:07.111 --> 01:57:09.693
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting for our chatroom contestant to give an answer.

01:57:10.093 --> 01:57:11.434
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, do you know an answer yet?

01:57:12.054 --> 01:57:12.554
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I do.

01:57:12.794 --> 01:57:13.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

01:57:13.315 --> 01:57:14.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:57:14.595 --> 01:57:15.756
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting on our chatroom contestant.

01:57:17.011 --> 01:57:22.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Contestant X-Link to send me something.

01:57:24.774 --> 01:57:25.634
[SPEAKER_03]: I just typed hurry.

01:57:26.655 --> 01:57:27.275
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.

01:57:27.315 --> 01:57:27.815
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an answer.

01:57:28.916 --> 01:57:29.296
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:57:30.296 --> 01:57:32.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it could be the obvious answer.

01:57:32.317 --> 01:57:33.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's not obvious.

01:57:33.597 --> 01:57:33.878
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:57:34.258 --> 01:57:39.520
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole reason for this is that she's waiting for an ultimate karaoke game called Sing for Your... Ranma, Sing for Your...

01:57:40.572 --> 01:57:41.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Alcohol.

01:57:41.353 --> 01:57:44.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your alcohol, says Ranma.

01:57:45.256 --> 01:57:52.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chatter, X-Link, says she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing for Your Life, says the chatter.

01:57:52.943 --> 01:57:53.924
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your life.

01:57:54.765 --> 01:57:56.967
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, DarkSakura, we'll start with you on this question.

01:57:57.627 --> 01:57:58.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your...

01:58:01.457 --> 01:58:02.418
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have a match.

01:58:02.578 --> 01:58:02.918
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?

01:58:02.938 --> 01:58:03.758
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say booze.

01:58:04.158 --> 01:58:05.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your booze!

01:58:05.879 --> 01:58:08.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, this game's super rigged tonight.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.241
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma already got a point.

01:58:10.341 --> 01:58:11.521
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's see what happens.

01:58:11.581 --> 01:58:13.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, you're on the board with a point.

01:58:13.101 --> 01:58:13.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

01:58:13.802 --> 01:58:14.602
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your booze.

01:58:14.622 --> 01:58:15.122
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a match.

01:58:15.402 --> 01:58:16.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, match!

01:58:16.423 --> 01:58:17.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

01:58:17.743 --> 01:58:18.563
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

01:58:19.024 --> 01:58:22.885
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the first time in the history of this game we matched on the very first answer.

01:58:22.905 --> 01:58:28.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we go through, we've gone through games and games where nobody ever matches a goddamn thing.

01:58:29.187 --> 01:58:30.548
[SPEAKER_03]: This is epic match game tonight.

01:58:30.628 --> 01:58:37.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Sauce, she made a karaoke game called Sing for Your... I think this will possibly count for a match.

01:58:37.651 --> 01:58:39.091
[SPEAKER_07]: I said Sing for Your Survival.

01:58:39.391 --> 01:58:41.172
[SPEAKER_07]: Please remove that shotgun from my head.

01:58:42.493 --> 01:58:44.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for Your Survival.

01:58:44.273 --> 01:58:45.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Will we count it?

01:58:46.388 --> 01:58:48.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're going to count it as a match.

01:58:48.169 --> 01:58:48.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

01:58:48.789 --> 01:58:49.769
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's tied up.

01:58:49.889 --> 01:58:51.750
[SPEAKER_03]: One for Ranma, one for X-Link.

01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:54.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Loki, sing for your life.

01:58:55.972 --> 01:58:57.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, X-Link pulls ahead with two.

01:58:58.093 --> 01:58:59.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your life.

01:58:59.573 --> 01:59:00.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Two to one.

01:59:00.374 --> 01:59:04.355
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't think of anything, so that's the first thing that came up with.

01:59:04.956 --> 01:59:05.356
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:59:05.396 --> 01:59:05.616
[SPEAKER_04]: Clever.

01:59:06.769 --> 01:59:07.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami.

01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:10.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your... Guardian Legend remake.

01:59:10.792 --> 01:59:12.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Guardian Legend remake.

01:59:13.034 --> 01:59:14.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good, but not a match.

01:59:14.415 --> 01:59:14.675
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:59:15.276 --> 01:59:17.358
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I don't think this is going to be a match.

01:59:17.398 --> 01:59:19.479
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, sing for your child's freedom.

01:59:21.441 --> 01:59:28.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Also... Well, it's... I don't know if Jamie would play it, but, like, I don't know.

01:59:28.126 --> 01:59:30.268
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be something I could see that they would have at Golf Land.

01:59:30.348 --> 01:59:31.129
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:32.330
[SPEAKER_03]: Sing for your child's freedom.

01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:34.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, not a match.

01:59:34.852 --> 01:59:35.512
[SPEAKER_03]: You all right there, Jamie?

01:59:35.832 --> 01:59:36.073
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:59:37.168 --> 01:59:37.508
[SPEAKER_12]: Dork.

01:59:38.188 --> 01:59:38.989
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.

01:59:39.049 --> 01:59:41.670
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's X-Link 2, Ranma 1.

01:59:42.570 --> 01:59:45.031
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so Ranma, I don't know if it's rigged.

01:59:45.552 --> 01:59:45.972
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

01:59:47.052 --> 01:59:47.412
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

01:59:47.632 --> 01:59:49.993
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Ranma, it's an epic match game tonight.

01:59:50.014 --> 01:59:51.554
[SPEAKER_03]: There's four more chances to catch up.

01:59:51.594 --> 01:59:51.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

01:59:52.455 --> 01:59:54.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Question number two.

01:59:56.436 --> 01:59:56.856
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

01:59:57.397 --> 01:59:57.877
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that's me.

01:59:58.837 --> 01:59:59.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

02:00:21.468 --> 02:00:21.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

02:00:21.688 --> 02:00:21.768
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

02:00:46.741 --> 02:00:48.882
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, everybody here in studios dinged.

02:00:48.902 --> 02:00:49.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chat room's dinged.

02:00:50.223 --> 02:00:51.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, do you have an answer?

02:00:51.964 --> 02:00:52.444
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

02:00:52.724 --> 02:00:54.225
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, then we're going to get to it.

02:00:54.265 --> 02:00:55.966
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob is planning early for this year's E3.

02:00:56.286 --> 02:01:00.788
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the... Booth babes.

02:01:01.148 --> 02:01:04.070
[SPEAKER_03]: Booth babes, says Ranma.

02:01:04.230 --> 02:01:05.170
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, booth babes.

02:01:05.951 --> 02:01:10.573
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Link says, I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the games.

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:15.881
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like a pretty fucking obvious answer, right?

02:01:15.921 --> 02:01:16.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:01:16.441 --> 02:01:16.761
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:01:16.801 --> 02:01:17.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:01:19.082 --> 02:01:23.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we go for the obvious or did we go for crazy?

02:01:23.284 --> 02:01:23.644
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:01:23.804 --> 02:01:24.144
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:01:24.725 --> 02:01:26.565
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start again with DarkSakura.

02:01:26.705 --> 02:01:29.046
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to go and see all the... Fanboy wank.

02:01:29.467 --> 02:01:30.807
[SPEAKER_03]: Fanboy wank.

02:01:34.549 --> 02:01:35.849
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think technically that's a match.

02:01:35.889 --> 02:01:36.309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

02:01:37.230 --> 02:01:39.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Sauce, I can't wait to go back and see all the...

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:51.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Previews for SingStar Journey Previews for SingStar Journey I don't think that's a match with games Games is too broad But that's a very good answer Very good, you know me very well

02:01:52.751 --> 02:02:01.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, he can't wait to go back and see the... This is totally opposite of what you'd probably say anyways, but I said all the Paris Hilton games.

02:02:01.874 --> 02:02:03.655
[SPEAKER_03]: All the Paris Hilton games!

02:02:04.015 --> 02:02:04.155
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

02:02:04.955 --> 02:02:06.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in an alternate universe.

02:02:06.516 --> 02:02:08.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that match with just games, though?

02:02:08.136 --> 02:02:09.376
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it does.

02:02:09.977 --> 02:02:11.857
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, X-Links, too broad.

02:02:14.773 --> 02:02:19.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami, can't wait to go back and see all the... Fucking ABBA music games.

02:02:19.577 --> 02:02:21.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking ABBA music games.

02:02:22.399 --> 02:02:22.839
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:02:23.220 --> 02:02:24.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer, but not a match.

02:02:25.041 --> 02:02:26.962
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, now this is going to be tricky, okay?

02:02:27.002 --> 02:02:27.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I said.

02:02:27.683 --> 02:02:34.829
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Rob said, I can't wait to go back and see all the military men, is what I said.

02:02:34.929 --> 02:02:36.430
[SPEAKER_03]: But does that count for booth babes?

02:02:36.450 --> 02:02:39.032
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

02:02:39.052 --> 02:02:39.612
[SPEAKER_03]: You think so?

02:02:40.393 --> 02:02:40.673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:02:40.693 --> 02:02:41.754
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good question.

02:02:42.796 --> 02:02:43.978
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a booth babe for me.

02:02:44.378 --> 02:02:47.122
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, babe can go either way.

02:02:47.142 --> 02:02:47.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Babe can go either way.

02:02:48.103 --> 02:02:52.609
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Ranma, we're going to give you a point for matching on that one, even though you got the wrong gender.

02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.891
[SPEAKER_11]: Woohoo!

02:02:54.071 --> 02:02:54.372
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:02:56.394 --> 02:02:58.697
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares about gender here on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:02:58.778 --> 02:02:59.058
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:03:00.185 --> 02:03:00.665
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

02:03:00.766 --> 02:03:01.706
[SPEAKER_03]: We gave him a point for that.

02:03:01.906 --> 02:03:04.729
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so it's all tied up and the chatroom is complaining that it's rigged.

02:03:07.331 --> 02:03:08.572
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's my gift card.

02:03:08.652 --> 02:03:10.373
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell if it counts or not.

02:03:10.453 --> 02:03:11.054
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

02:03:11.394 --> 02:03:11.915
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:03:12.115 --> 02:03:12.555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

02:03:12.575 --> 02:03:13.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.

02:03:14.437 --> 02:03:17.239
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom, you just got served by a giggling geek girl.

02:03:17.439 --> 02:03:18.140
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out.

02:03:19.679 --> 02:03:22.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, let's get to question number three.

02:03:23.201 --> 02:03:24.641
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know it's a Loki question.

02:03:24.661 --> 02:03:25.882
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

02:03:26.002 --> 02:03:30.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Question number three in tonight's match game, epic match game here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:03:31.244 --> 02:03:35.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

02:03:36.647 --> 02:03:39.148
[SPEAKER_03]: He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

02:03:39.928 --> 02:03:45.351
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.

02:03:53.701 --> 02:03:54.322
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna ding.

02:03:54.382 --> 02:03:56.984
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna ding.

02:04:25.639 --> 02:04:27.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Ranma, did you ding?

02:04:28.302 --> 02:04:28.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

02:04:28.722 --> 02:04:29.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

02:04:30.083 --> 02:04:32.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

02:04:32.546 --> 02:04:34.247
[SPEAKER_03]: He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

02:04:34.287 --> 02:04:38.751
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of... Erotica.

02:04:39.272 --> 02:04:40.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Erotica.

02:04:40.933 --> 02:04:42.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and X-Link said...

02:04:43.601 --> 02:04:44.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Nude Ladies.

02:04:45.403 --> 02:04:47.125
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's almost the same thing.

02:04:47.205 --> 02:04:49.648
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just playing for points at this point.

02:04:49.708 --> 02:04:50.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Racking up the points.

02:04:50.909 --> 02:04:53.752
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, you can have pictures of?

02:04:54.052 --> 02:04:54.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Black Cock.

02:04:55.274 --> 02:04:56.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Black Cock.

02:04:59.338 --> 02:04:59.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a match.

02:05:00.039 --> 02:05:01.140
[SPEAKER_03]: And erotica's too broad.

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:01.340
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:05:01.480 --> 02:05:01.680
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:05:03.271 --> 02:05:04.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's not a match.

02:05:04.451 --> 02:05:06.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki has firmly said that's not a match.

02:05:07.052 --> 02:05:09.913
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Tiara, you can't have pictures of?

02:05:10.273 --> 02:05:11.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Iraqi suicide babies.

02:05:11.833 --> 02:05:13.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Iraqi suicide babies.

02:05:14.313 --> 02:05:17.034
[SPEAKER_03]: That is actually the first thing I put down, and I changed it.

02:05:17.154 --> 02:05:17.794
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

02:05:18.414 --> 02:05:19.275
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, not a match.

02:05:21.155 --> 02:05:25.416
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, if I am going to make a level, it will have Iraqi suicide babies in there.

02:05:26.396 --> 02:05:29.697
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, you can't have pictures of?

02:05:31.068 --> 02:05:32.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, blood and tits.

02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:35.692
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I put in my... Blood and tits.

02:05:35.732 --> 02:05:37.253
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fairly erotic.

02:05:39.535 --> 02:05:44.178
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like if we're going to give it to Ranma, then we also need to give it to X-Link for nude ladies.

02:05:45.599 --> 02:05:46.200
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so why not?

02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.101
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give them both a point.

02:05:47.141 --> 02:05:47.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

02:05:47.681 --> 02:05:49.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:05:49.042 --> 02:05:49.923
[SPEAKER_03]: A point for everybody!

02:05:49.943 --> 02:05:50.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:05:50.363 --> 02:05:51.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Blood and tits.

02:05:53.225 --> 02:05:53.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:05:54.286 --> 02:05:58.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, you can't have pictures of... Iraqi suicide babies.

02:05:58.269 --> 02:06:00.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Iraqi suicide babies.

02:06:01.673 --> 02:06:08.179
[SPEAKER_03]: And my answer was, you can't have pictures of Cylon-occupied Caprica because it's copyrighted.

02:06:08.279 --> 02:06:10.360
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I went from one OLR joke to another.

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:11.201
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I did.

02:06:11.421 --> 02:06:11.962
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:06:12.802 --> 02:06:14.964
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have pictures of Cylon-occupied Caprica.

02:06:15.485 --> 02:06:20.409
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, Iraqi Suicide Babies is not copyrighted, but Cylon-occupied Caprica is.

02:06:20.429 --> 02:06:21.190
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I changed it.

02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:22.871
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put a fucking copyright on it.

02:06:22.991 --> 02:06:23.251
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:06:25.573 --> 02:06:30.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I love some of the answers the chat room came up with here.

02:06:30.335 --> 02:06:31.395
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.

02:06:31.515 --> 02:06:33.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Two Men Kissing was one of them.

02:06:34.896 --> 02:06:37.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Pictures of Sky's Old Public Access Show.

02:06:37.637 --> 02:06:38.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Tingle.

02:06:39.018 --> 02:06:40.038
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think of that one.

02:06:40.078 --> 02:06:40.778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great one.

02:06:40.838 --> 02:06:41.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Tingle Penis.

02:06:42.199 --> 02:06:43.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Lego Tingle.

02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:46.320
[SPEAKER_03]: I have judgment.

02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:47.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, good job.

02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:48.981
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we have more.

02:06:50.421 --> 02:06:51.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, it's all tied up.

[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

02:11:01.982 --> 02:11:04.823
[SPEAKER_03]: We got two pretty extreme different answers there.

02:11:05.163 --> 02:11:07.004
[SPEAKER_03]: This could make all the difference.

02:11:07.084 --> 02:11:10.845
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, he's spending the gift card on porn.

02:11:11.165 --> 02:11:12.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn!

[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, X-Link pulls ahead, but it's not over yet.

[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:11:20.388 --> 02:11:20.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Sauce.

02:11:22.509 --> 02:11:24.270
[SPEAKER_03]: She says she couldn't use fanboy wank again.

02:11:24.730 --> 02:11:25.010
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:11:26.815 --> 02:11:29.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Sauce, he's going to spend the gift card on?

02:11:29.557 --> 02:11:31.138
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually did say Warcraft.

02:11:31.198 --> 02:11:32.259
[SPEAKER_03]: Warcraft.

02:11:32.399 --> 02:11:33.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:34.481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tied again.

02:11:35.081 --> 02:11:35.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

02:11:35.561 --> 02:11:36.702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's back to 4-4.

[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:11:37.783 --> 02:11:38.183
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:11:39.644 --> 02:11:40.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

02:11:40.545 --> 02:11:40.825
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:11:40.905 --> 02:11:43.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, he's going to spend the gift card on?

02:11:43.427 --> 02:11:44.747
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say either of those.

02:11:44.807 --> 02:11:46.228
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Better Joke Books.

02:11:46.509 --> 02:11:47.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Better Joke Books.

02:11:48.490 --> 02:11:49.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he might need that.

02:11:50.231 --> 02:11:54.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so Drew, it comes down to you and me.

02:11:54.435 --> 02:11:55.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one of us matches.

02:11:56.737 --> 02:11:57.458
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to go first?

02:11:58.299 --> 02:11:58.980
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you should.

02:11:59.180 --> 02:11:59.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you think I should?

02:12:00.181 --> 02:12:04.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I said he's going to spend his gift card on a life.

02:12:06.387 --> 02:12:06.987
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo.

02:12:07.108 --> 02:12:08.729
[SPEAKER_03]: But I put a heart next to it, so it's okay.

02:12:08.789 --> 02:12:09.470
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a joke.

02:12:09.550 --> 02:12:11.712
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's going to spend his gift card on actually getting a life.

02:12:12.313 --> 02:12:12.773
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:13.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you, bro.

02:12:14.403 --> 02:12:14.724
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:12:15.305 --> 02:12:20.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, he's going to spend the gift card on... Getting Kim to California, you fucking perverts.

02:12:25.635 --> 02:12:27.696
[SPEAKER_03]: So the match game ends tonight in a tie.

02:12:27.756 --> 02:12:29.137
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we do in case of a tie?

02:12:29.197 --> 02:12:29.778
[SPEAKER_03]: Lie radio.

02:12:29.798 --> 02:12:30.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have to do another question?

02:12:31.359 --> 02:12:31.779
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do one.

02:12:31.839 --> 02:12:32.079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do one.

02:12:32.099 --> 02:12:32.319
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

02:12:32.379 --> 02:12:33.760
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the gift card just as planned.

02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:34.420
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, Drew.

02:12:34.461 --> 02:12:34.781
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do one.

02:12:34.821 --> 02:12:35.121
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do one.

02:12:35.161 --> 02:12:35.701
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to do one?

02:12:35.721 --> 02:12:35.941
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do one.

02:12:35.961 --> 02:12:36.282
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do one.

02:12:36.622 --> 02:12:36.942
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:12:37.062 --> 02:12:37.983
[SPEAKER_03]: One more question.

02:12:38.343 --> 02:12:41.425
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming from... Completely off the top of my head.

02:12:41.585 --> 02:12:42.846
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little worried about this one.

02:12:43.106 --> 02:12:45.868
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to talk fast because I have to message it to X-Link, okay?

02:12:46.228 --> 02:12:46.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:12:46.608 --> 02:12:46.868
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:12:47.068 --> 02:12:47.268
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.

02:12:47.949 --> 02:12:52.051
[SPEAKER_05]: During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie.

02:12:52.232 --> 02:12:53.732
[SPEAKER_05]: They couldn't think up another...

02:12:56.266 --> 02:12:57.627
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question for Match Game.

02:12:58.027 --> 02:13:01.549
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead, they decided to settle the tie by a blank.

02:13:07.872 --> 02:13:09.352
[SPEAKER_05]: I repeat, if I can remember.

02:13:10.313 --> 02:13:15.635
[SPEAKER_05]: During an episode of Orange Sounds Radio, they had a tie in the Match Game.

02:13:16.876 --> 02:13:21.418
[SPEAKER_05]: And they couldn't think up another question, so they had to solve the tie by a blank.

02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:25.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Ding.

02:13:32.588 --> 02:13:33.069
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:13:34.090 --> 02:13:34.410
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:36.453
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you guys get your answers so fast?

02:13:37.273 --> 02:13:39.256
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I did the obvious answer.

02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:45.092
[SPEAKER_04]: Fanboy Wing, of course.

02:13:45.973 --> 02:13:49.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be... Don't be giving things away.

02:13:49.516 --> 02:13:51.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding, I didn't... Just kidding.

02:13:52.619 --> 02:13:53.960
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't say that, it's retarded.

02:13:58.644 --> 02:13:59.545
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I don't know.

02:14:12.409 --> 02:14:13.550
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I've typed out my answer.

02:14:13.610 --> 02:14:14.490
[SPEAKER_03]: It's long and dramatic.

02:14:15.171 --> 02:14:16.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm waiting on X-Link.

02:14:19.093 --> 02:14:22.615
[SPEAKER_03]: During an episode of Orange Launch Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up another question for match game.

02:14:22.955 --> 02:14:26.097
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead, they decided to settle a tie by blank.

02:14:27.498 --> 02:14:28.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I'm waiting on X-Link still.

02:14:30.788 --> 02:14:42.337
[SPEAKER_05]: Lala, Lala, Match Game Music, Match Game Music, Porn Porn, Wank Wank I'm reading some of the comments in chat.

02:14:42.357 --> 02:14:43.038
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty bad.

02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:46.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Butt Sex Battle?

02:14:46.521 --> 02:14:46.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

02:14:47.381 --> 02:14:47.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

02:14:49.403 --> 02:14:49.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:14:50.784 --> 02:14:51.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on!

02:14:53.066 --> 02:14:55.528
[SPEAKER_05]: It's by inflammation.

02:14:56.509 --> 02:14:57.830
[SPEAKER_05]: To see who's more inflamed.

02:14:59.784 --> 02:15:00.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he still in chat?

02:15:01.187 --> 02:15:02.049
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did we scare him off?

02:15:03.052 --> 02:15:03.553
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you there?

02:15:03.573 --> 02:15:08.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have an answer?

02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:10.100
[SPEAKER_03]: I like what the Rob D says in chat.

02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:13.041
[SPEAKER_03]: The OLR match game wouldn't end and DMN was spamming in chat.

02:15:13.081 --> 02:15:16.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky then said to DMN, you better stop that you ass piper or I'll blank.

02:15:18.602 --> 02:15:19.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that'll be the next question.

02:15:20.903 --> 02:15:21.423
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

02:15:21.463 --> 02:15:21.823
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:15:22.323 --> 02:15:30.045
[SPEAKER_03]: If X-Link doesn't give me an answer in like 15 seconds, I am discounting his answer this round and Ranma will have to match by himself.

02:15:30.405 --> 02:15:30.785
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.

02:15:30.805 --> 02:15:30.785
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 12,

02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:46.592
[SPEAKER_03]: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, oh, oh, oh, oh, there it is, okay, there it is.

02:15:47.932 --> 02:15:56.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, finally, Ranma, during an episode of OLR there was a tie and they couldn't think of one, so they decided to sell a tie by... A fight to the flaming death!

02:15:57.374 --> 02:15:59.494
[SPEAKER_03]: A fight to the flaming death.

02:16:00.675 --> 02:16:01.935
[SPEAKER_03]: And X-Link said...

02:16:03.453 --> 02:16:11.459
[SPEAKER_12]: A fight!

02:16:11.699 --> 02:16:15.301
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I think we might have a way to break the tie.

02:16:15.401 --> 02:16:16.042
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hold on.

02:16:16.382 --> 02:16:23.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so, DarkSakura, they decided to settle the score by... A fight to the finish?

02:16:23.927 --> 02:16:25.108
[SPEAKER_03]: A fight to the finish!

02:16:25.949 --> 02:16:27.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that's a point for each.

02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:31.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Sauce, they decided to settle the score by...

02:16:32.332 --> 02:16:52.545
[SPEAKER_03]: SingStarAba Showdown SingStarAba Showdown That's a fight to the death That's a wonderful answer Loki, they decided to settle the score by a tiebreaker You know what, just give Loki the gift card honestly

02:17:00.503 --> 02:17:01.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Thunderdome, A Vite to the Finish

02:17:29.577 --> 02:17:30.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so a point for each of them.

02:17:30.858 --> 02:17:31.258
[SPEAKER_03]: A fight.

02:17:32.058 --> 02:17:32.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Another fight.

02:17:32.879 --> 02:17:33.159
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:17:34.019 --> 02:17:34.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, though.

02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my answer.

02:17:38.102 --> 02:17:42.724
[SPEAKER_03]: They decided to settle the score by setting the studio on fire.

02:17:42.924 --> 02:17:43.965
[SPEAKER_03]: But please don't actually do this.

02:17:44.825 --> 02:17:48.287
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm thinking Ranma did say a fight to the flaming finish.

02:17:49.548 --> 02:17:51.769
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might match with Ranma.

02:17:54.665 --> 02:17:59.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we're still in a tie, so what happens?

02:17:59.188 --> 02:18:00.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Does neither one win?

02:18:00.329 --> 02:18:02.151
[SPEAKER_05]: One more question!

02:18:02.631 --> 02:18:04.753
[SPEAKER_03]: This segment's getting way too long.

02:18:04.853 --> 02:18:07.735
[SPEAKER_05]: Read the one that Rob D. Alright, we're going to do Rob D.'

02:18:07.715 --> 02:18:08.215
[SPEAKER_03]: 's question?

02:18:08.936 --> 02:18:10.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, this is it.

02:18:10.297 --> 02:18:13.839
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, if we don't have a winner here, then I don't know, we'll just give it away next week or something.

02:18:13.859 --> 02:18:14.600
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what we're going to do.

02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:18.423
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, or we'll flip a damn coin, says Brad.

02:18:27.642 --> 02:18:28.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio

02:18:58.583 --> 02:18:59.283
[SPEAKER_03]: Power Chords

02:19:27.155 --> 02:19:29.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, why, we can't do the Rob D's question?

02:19:30.617 --> 02:19:31.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll do that.

02:19:31.638 --> 02:19:40.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we're going to do the Rob D's question and this hopefully will fix what's going on here and then we can get on with our lives.

02:19:40.605 --> 02:19:42.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

02:19:44.668 --> 02:19:45.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question for the Match Game Night.

02:19:46.189 --> 02:19:50.352
[SPEAKER_03]: The OLR Match Game wouldn't end and DMN was spamming in chat.

02:19:50.953 --> 02:19:54.956
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky then said to DMN, you better stop that, you ass piper, or I'll blank.

02:20:07.177 --> 02:20:07.417
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:20:10.679 --> 02:20:11.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:13.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Did both ladies ding?

02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:14.341
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:20:15.861 --> 02:20:17.042
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same... Oh, wow.

02:20:17.542 --> 02:20:18.103
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hot.

02:20:19.583 --> 02:20:20.003
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:20:22.425 --> 02:20:23.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, everybody's dinged.

02:20:24.786 --> 02:20:25.206
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma.

02:20:26.267 --> 02:20:26.467
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

02:20:26.487 --> 02:20:27.987
[SPEAKER_03]: The OLR match game wouldn't end.

02:20:28.007 --> 02:20:30.849
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone on way too long and DMN was spamming in chat.

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:34.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky then said to DMN, you better stop that, you ass piper, or I'll what?

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:36.594
[SPEAKER_03]: Violate you.

02:20:37.234 --> 02:20:38.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Violate you.

02:20:39.115 --> 02:20:39.395
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:20:39.415 --> 02:20:43.496
[SPEAKER_03]: And X-Link said, come to your house and break your computer with a gun.

02:20:44.297 --> 02:20:44.557
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:20:44.637 --> 02:20:46.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, we have two different answers.

02:20:46.097 --> 02:20:47.478
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we can finally break the tie.

02:20:47.518 --> 02:20:47.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

02:20:48.338 --> 02:20:50.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to your house and break your computer with a gun or violate you.

02:20:51.699 --> 02:20:52.279
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

02:20:54.100 --> 02:20:56.941
[SPEAKER_05]: I put bang you with a big black cock.

02:20:57.401 --> 02:20:58.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Bang you with a big black cock.

02:20:59.241 --> 02:21:00.762
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that would be violating you.

02:21:01.622 --> 02:21:02.062
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

02:21:02.662 --> 02:21:03.023
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:21:03.043 --> 02:21:03.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Sauce.

02:21:03.603 --> 02:21:03.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Sauce.

02:21:05.336 --> 02:21:32.238
[SPEAKER_03]: kick you in the balls kick you in the balls not a match Loki, I will destroy you destroy you not a match Drew, I will burn you with an HD DVD laser burn you with an HD DVD laser burn your face off melt your face off with a laser not a match my answer was cuddle with you

02:21:34.895 --> 02:21:37.678
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this has been our biggest number of points scored in a match game to date

02:21:57.519 --> 02:21:59.400
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a booby prize for X-Link tonight.

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:07.145
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have a code still for Banjo-Kazooie on the Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade, and we're going to give that to X-Link.

02:22:07.705 --> 02:22:09.126
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody's a winner tonight.

02:22:09.566 --> 02:22:10.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:22:10.907 --> 02:22:11.387
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

02:22:11.807 --> 02:22:20.412
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say, Ranchan, if you'll send me a private message on Twitter with your email address, I'll email you the Amazon gift card certificate thingy.

02:22:21.092 --> 02:22:21.372
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:22:21.953 --> 02:22:22.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:22:22.793 --> 02:22:25.775
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you want to say anything lastly to the chatters who say it was rigged?

02:22:28.177 --> 02:22:30.018
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yeah.

02:22:30.879 --> 02:22:33.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha, ha, ha.

02:22:33.981 --> 02:22:34.621
[SPEAKER_03]: So eloquent.

02:22:34.861 --> 02:22:35.702
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, Ranma.

02:22:36.362 --> 02:22:36.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

02:22:37.123 --> 02:22:37.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

02:22:38.184 --> 02:22:43.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that segment was only 32 minutes long, according to Ranma's call.

02:22:43.387 --> 02:22:44.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Lord.

02:22:44.788 --> 02:22:51.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, keep in mind, you know, for about five minutes of that, we were experiencing technical difficulties.

02:22:53.573 --> 02:22:56.775
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so to everybody who didn't win tonight, boo-hoo for you.

02:22:57.736 --> 02:23:00.898
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got some more news to do and then we're going to take a couple quick, quick calls tonight.

02:23:00.958 --> 02:23:03.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we've got to keep it short tonight because we did not expect Match Game to take so long.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:04.740
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for that.

02:23:05.021 --> 02:23:05.381
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

02:23:05.401 --> 02:23:06.361
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a slow news week.

02:23:06.401 --> 02:23:06.842
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a deal.

02:23:07.402 --> 02:23:08.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Just deal, okay?

02:23:08.443 --> 02:23:08.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Deal.

02:23:09.483 --> 02:23:09.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

02:23:11.304 --> 02:23:17.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you ever thought to yourself when playing a game of pinball, gee, I wish I could learn about flatulence right now?

02:23:17.427 --> 02:23:27.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now you can, thanks to a custom pinball game called Gas Attack that was part of an exhibit in Grossology.

02:23:27.791 --> 02:23:43.897
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently these two exhibits, or this part of the exhibit, your pinball is actually bacteria and you bump it into different foods that cause flatulence, including meat, onions, you name it.

02:23:45.137 --> 02:23:52.440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, cabbage is on there, brussel sprouts, cheese, all sorts of stuff.

02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:57.042
[SPEAKER_04]: And they do have a picture of intestines right above it.

02:23:58.394 --> 02:23:59.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the ramp?

02:24:00.735 --> 02:24:02.155
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's not the ramp.

02:24:02.696 --> 02:24:09.178
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a few clear ramps that are in there, but it has a toilet and a bunch of other stuff on there.

02:24:09.418 --> 02:24:12.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty basic looking, but it gets the message across, I guess.

02:24:12.439 --> 02:24:13.419
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something else.

02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:14.740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:17.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee asked the question I want to know.

02:24:17.961 --> 02:24:18.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I play this?

02:24:21.942 --> 02:24:25.564
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not sure where this exhibit's actually at.

02:24:26.144 --> 02:24:26.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

02:24:28.303 --> 02:24:30.244
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:24:48.274 --> 02:24:53.497
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if this game is going to be any better or worse, but... Oh, sorry, to interrupt real quick.

02:24:53.537 --> 02:25:01.982
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually find out more about the Grossology Tour by going to grossologytour.com, and they have, I think, the dates that they'll be available.

02:25:02.602 --> 02:25:03.283
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how convenient.

02:25:04.423 --> 02:25:04.723
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:25:05.144 --> 02:25:07.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, if that game doesn't sound like your...

02:25:08.362 --> 02:25:10.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Your idea of a good time, maybe this one will be a little better.

02:25:10.723 --> 02:25:15.325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Push-Up Foo is a new game that has come out for the iPhone.

02:25:15.406 --> 02:25:22.069
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a part of a series called the Foo Apps, like Shaq Foo, but this is called Push-Up Foo.

02:25:22.809 --> 02:25:31.814
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently what this is, it uses the device's accelerometer to track how many push-ups you're doing and give you feedback on how you're doing with your push-ups.

02:25:32.674 --> 02:25:34.035
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of interesting, I guess.

02:25:35.015 --> 02:25:42.158
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you put the thing on your back or something or where you put this when you're doing your push-ups, but I guess it actually tracks how many push-ups you're doing and how well you've done.

02:25:42.438 --> 02:25:43.439
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the other cool thing.

02:25:43.939 --> 02:25:50.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Push-up Fu also lets you join a tracked league or you can go head-to-head in what's called a battle mode.

02:25:50.922 --> 02:25:53.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's a course in it that trains you to do 100 push-ups.

02:25:56.845 --> 02:26:00.287
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of an interesting use for the iPhone.

02:26:00.647 --> 02:26:02.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like throwing a Wii Fit angle into it.

02:26:02.709 --> 02:26:08.893
[SPEAKER_04]: Or teaching you how to shake or tilt the iPhone into thinking that you've done 100 push-ups.

02:26:09.273 --> 02:26:10.014
[SPEAKER_04]: For real, huh?

02:26:10.054 --> 02:26:14.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like how you can shake the remote and it makes Wii Fit think you're jogging.

02:26:16.707 --> 02:26:25.290
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, this might actually be kind of a fun competitive way, like, to do, like, if you and your friends are doing it for, like, actual push-ups, this might be kind of a fun way to motivate people.

02:26:25.450 --> 02:26:25.791
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:26:26.371 --> 02:26:27.691
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they come out with other versions of it.

02:26:29.012 --> 02:26:29.352
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:26:30.913 --> 02:26:32.613
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says you put it in your pants.

02:26:33.834 --> 02:26:35.094
[SPEAKER_03]: I always put it in my pants.

02:26:35.755 --> 02:26:36.035
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:26:36.775 --> 02:26:37.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, I don't know.

02:26:37.935 --> 02:26:38.716
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks interesting.

02:26:39.036 --> 02:26:40.236
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's free, I'll check it out.

02:26:40.276 --> 02:26:41.697
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not, then I probably won't.

02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:47.812
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I... Actually, I have this that I'm reporting on next.

02:26:48.932 --> 02:26:52.674
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get Game & Watch games on your iPhone.

02:26:53.615 --> 02:26:55.196
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've downloaded two of them.

02:26:56.797 --> 02:27:06.082
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they're done a little differently, but they still really are the Game & Watch games.

02:27:06.582 --> 02:27:10.164
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got Parachute, Chef, Fire, and Octopus games.

02:27:11.525 --> 02:27:16.907
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but they're called GW Parachute, GW Chef, GW Fire, GW Octopus.

02:27:17.007 --> 02:27:18.088
[SPEAKER_05]: They're $1.99.

02:27:19.128 --> 02:27:24.411
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then, um, wait till Nintendo hears about it.

02:27:24.631 --> 02:27:26.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hurry before a cease and desist gets sent.

02:27:26.832 --> 02:27:27.592
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty fun.

02:27:28.373 --> 02:27:29.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Which will probably be Monday.

02:27:30.233 --> 02:27:31.134
[SPEAKER_05]: You better get them now.

02:27:33.676 --> 02:27:42.599
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw something on one of those gaming blogs that was talking about an app that wasn't accepted into Apple's app store there.

02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:49.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it was a booby shaking game that you can shake your iPhone in the boob shake.

02:27:49.762 --> 02:27:50.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

02:27:51.483 --> 02:27:52.684
[SPEAKER_04]: And this wasn't accepted, why?

02:27:53.344 --> 02:27:56.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Because apparently it's inappropriate for people.

02:27:57.226 --> 02:27:57.766
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:27:58.606 --> 02:27:59.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

02:27:59.987 --> 02:28:00.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:28:00.649 --> 02:28:00.929
[SPEAKER_03]: GripShift

02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:25.510
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:57.562
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, they just need to give up on patching it already.

02:28:57.583 --> 02:28:58.584
[SPEAKER_04]: They should just give up.

02:28:58.844 --> 02:29:00.346
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, you know... But they won't.

02:29:00.366 --> 02:29:04.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they think they kind of owe it to the people that make games for their system?

02:29:05.232 --> 02:29:05.873
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess.

02:29:06.453 --> 02:29:06.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

02:29:06.734 --> 02:29:07.795
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll never ever work.

02:29:09.281 --> 02:29:11.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, Tomb Raider Underworld.

02:29:11.883 --> 02:29:14.064
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a fan of Tomb Raider Underworld, guess what?

02:29:14.104 --> 02:29:15.785
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download the soundtrack for free.

02:29:16.326 --> 02:29:17.266
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, free.

02:29:18.627 --> 02:29:31.936
[SPEAKER_03]: What you can actually choose, you can choose some songs that are associated with the game's locals, or you can get a deluxe edition soundtrack that contains all 71 tracks, 320 kbps mp3 formats.

02:29:32.396 --> 02:29:32.937
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

02:29:33.057 --> 02:29:38.240
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do to get the soundtrack, it's a free download, tombraidercronicles.com.

02:29:39.441 --> 02:29:41.502
[SPEAKER_03]: slash underworld slash soundtrack.html.

02:29:41.522 --> 02:29:43.923
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all there for download if you want to check out some of the music from the game.

02:29:45.563 --> 02:29:46.704
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not too shabby.

02:29:47.264 --> 02:29:47.904
[SPEAKER_05]: That's special.

02:29:48.244 --> 02:29:49.305
[SPEAKER_03]: Who likes free stuff?

02:29:49.685 --> 02:29:50.265
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I do.

02:29:50.705 --> 02:29:51.466
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like Yaris.

02:29:51.846 --> 02:29:52.166
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:29:52.186 --> 02:29:53.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's true.

02:29:53.846 --> 02:29:55.867
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some last-minute stories tonight?

02:29:55.887 --> 02:29:57.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any last-minute stories here?

02:29:57.308 --> 02:29:58.168
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't do FUs.

02:29:59.108 --> 02:30:00.149
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do FUs?

02:30:00.809 --> 02:30:02.990
[SPEAKER_03]: I neglected to put it in the showroom.

02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:03.610
[SPEAKER_05]: FU!

02:30:05.051 --> 02:30:05.871
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

02:30:06.091 --> 02:30:06.511
[SPEAKER_03]: F me.

02:30:07.892 --> 02:30:08.592
[SPEAKER_03]: How horrible.

02:30:09.244 --> 02:30:10.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, we're still plenty pissed off

02:30:41.898 --> 02:30:50.129
[SPEAKER_05]: FU goes to be woken up from a deep sleep this morning to be bitched at.

02:30:54.134 --> 02:30:54.595
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

02:30:55.456 --> 02:30:56.157
[SPEAKER_05]: And the damn table.

02:30:57.138 --> 02:30:57.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, sauce.

02:30:59.892 --> 02:31:25.975
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to keep this short but Ranchan sent me a Christmas card for Christmas obviously and when I received it the envelope had been completely opened on three sides by someone else who obviously thought that maybe there was games and prizes inside of some sort but F you to that person who opened it and F you to my mailman who delivered it to the wrong place Loki

02:31:27.694 --> 02:31:27.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew?

02:31:28.014 --> 02:31:28.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew?

02:31:55.786 --> 02:31:57.107
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to the card table.

02:31:58.648 --> 02:32:04.113
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to UPS being unnaturally slow in bringing me my new mouse.

02:32:04.753 --> 02:32:08.396
[SPEAKER_13]: Ordered a G9 for like 45 bucks last week.

02:32:08.976 --> 02:32:11.778
[SPEAKER_13]: It's taken 10 days to get to my house.

02:32:11.838 --> 02:32:16.182
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now it's sitting over the weekend in West Sac, 10 miles away.

02:32:16.922 --> 02:32:19.084
[SPEAKER_13]: When it should be, you know, on my desk.

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:24.348
[SPEAKER_13]: Also F you to being sick and sleeping all the time when you're sick.

02:32:28.151 --> 02:32:29.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to have to echo some of what Drew said.

02:32:29.953 --> 02:32:33.238
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to being sick, especially the week before I'm supposed to go on vacation.

02:32:33.338 --> 02:32:35.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Four days before I'm supposed to go on vacation, I'm getting sick.

02:32:37.224 --> 02:32:37.784
[SPEAKER_03]: God hates me.

02:32:38.185 --> 02:32:39.687
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, F you to people named Alex.

02:32:40.228 --> 02:32:40.969
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're done.

02:32:42.191 --> 02:32:43.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, F you Alex, whoever you are.

02:32:44.033 --> 02:32:44.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:32:45.825 --> 02:32:48.846
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit.

02:32:48.866 --> 02:32:50.287
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take a couple calls tonight.

02:32:50.707 --> 02:32:57.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we ran a little long because of match games, so we don't want to go on all night long because we still have an afterbirth we've got to get to because we didn't do an afterbirth last week.

02:32:58.190 --> 02:33:00.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, oh boy, just too much going on here at Last Minute Stories.

02:33:00.971 --> 02:33:01.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, last minute stories.

02:33:01.691 --> 02:33:03.152
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Loki, do you have something you want to get to?

02:33:03.312 --> 02:33:04.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, real quick.

02:33:04.032 --> 02:33:05.033
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of a funny one.

02:33:06.633 --> 02:33:12.775
[SPEAKER_04]: We have EA branching out into a new field of video games, for them at least.

02:33:13.355 --> 02:33:18.277
[SPEAKER_04]: They're tackling the love simulation market with a brand new game.

02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:23.821
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually coming out in Japan.

02:33:24.381 --> 02:33:33.608
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Hachio Koi, and it's a game that features big-breasted women that you apparently rub tanning lotion on.

02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:36.330
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

02:33:37.491 --> 02:33:37.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

02:33:38.832 --> 02:33:39.173
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:33:40.514 --> 02:33:40.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:33:41.074 --> 02:33:43.276
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now on the Skype line with a caller.

02:33:43.336 --> 02:33:43.856
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, caller.

02:33:43.876 --> 02:33:44.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

02:33:45.477 --> 02:33:47.079
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is Spazinator.

02:33:47.299 --> 02:33:47.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Spazinator.

02:33:47.979 --> 02:33:48.680
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind tonight?

02:33:51.547 --> 02:33:52.148
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things.

02:33:53.989 --> 02:33:56.752
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I've got some news for you.

02:33:57.032 --> 02:34:01.436
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to update my, or replace my PlayStation 3.

02:34:03.497 --> 02:34:07.921
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not exactly the same model as I had before, but I'll take what I can get.

02:34:08.562 --> 02:34:09.082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.

02:34:09.102 --> 02:34:10.984
[SPEAKER_03]: The ongoing saga of the stolen PlayStation 3.

02:34:11.284 --> 02:34:14.707
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, it sounds like it was never found, but you got a replacement.

02:34:16.108 --> 02:34:17.289
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:34:17.749 --> 02:34:17.870
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

02:34:18.866 --> 02:34:27.190
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I just basically checked out home for the first time since I replaced my PlayStation 3.

02:34:27.911 --> 02:34:46.120
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you know anything about it, but wasn't there supposed to be something in home that basically allowed you to go into your pocket or whatever, bring your friends in and be able to stream your music or videos and photos and stuff like that?

02:34:46.761 --> 02:34:59.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was in the early beta, but unfortunately it does not look like that function has hit the finished product, much like half of the other things that Sony said was going to be in there, such as the trophy cases you were going to have for all the trophies that you get in the games, and a couple other things.

02:35:00.616 --> 02:35:06.142
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were probably a little worried, as they should be, about people putting copyright content all over their house.

02:35:08.183 --> 02:35:09.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and in a way I can see why they're kind of hesitant.

02:35:09.844 --> 02:35:10.904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just for copyrighted stuff.

02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:48.639
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know how the media and other people whose names I won't mention like to get all up in arms about stupid things.

02:35:48.979 --> 02:36:00.588
[SPEAKER_01]: If they had put the streaming functionality into home, someone would have been stupid enough to stream porn or whatever it is.

02:36:01.707 --> 02:36:11.741
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone will kill, see it, and all of a sudden, you know, we'll be getting a gas link to the fire, you know, give those people ammo to shoot us with, you know.

02:36:14.008 --> 02:36:17.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, if somebody's going to do something inappropriate, they should just simply be banned.

02:36:17.229 --> 02:36:19.869
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be a really, really easy way to report and ban those people.

02:36:20.889 --> 02:36:24.730
[SPEAKER_03]: There already should be something set up because there's already some craziness going on at home.

02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:27.011
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you my favorite thing I've discovered to do at home.

02:36:27.351 --> 02:36:32.672
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to go in the movie theater where the previews are playing, especially when there's like one preview playing over and over and over again.

02:36:33.272 --> 02:36:35.992
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to go stand right in the middle of the screen and dance.

02:36:37.513 --> 02:36:38.833
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my favorite thing to do at home.

02:36:39.505 --> 02:36:41.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've seen people do that already.

02:36:41.106 --> 02:36:42.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, thank you.

02:36:42.026 --> 02:36:42.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Later, dude.

02:37:06.175 --> 02:37:07.095
[SPEAKER_03]: And check out Prince of Persia.

02:37:07.115 --> 02:37:08.556
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another game I've been playing more of lately.

02:37:08.576 --> 02:37:09.196
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fun game.

02:37:09.496 --> 02:37:11.557
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Prince of Persia because it's for dummies like me.

02:37:11.597 --> 02:37:12.417
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't die.

02:37:13.117 --> 02:37:14.637
[SPEAKER_03]: She always freaking saves you.

02:37:15.718 --> 02:37:17.198
[SPEAKER_03]: The little sidekick you roll with.

02:37:17.218 --> 02:37:18.698
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:37:18.759 --> 02:37:19.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Another last minute story, Loki?

02:37:21.499 --> 02:37:22.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, actually.

02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:32.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently GameStop is no longer accepting Xbox game systems or accessories in trade effective February 9th.

02:37:32.282 --> 02:37:33.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though more people are playing them than PS3s?

02:37:33.883 --> 02:37:33.963
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:37:36.536 --> 02:37:39.958
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're playing them, you're certainly not playing them from GameStop now.

02:37:40.078 --> 02:37:41.059
[SPEAKER_03]: So hurry up and get them in.

02:37:41.499 --> 02:37:41.719
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

02:37:42.459 --> 02:37:42.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:37:45.081 --> 02:37:48.743
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, Wii Sports is now the best-selling game of all time.

02:37:50.264 --> 02:37:52.145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's even exceeded Super Mario Bros.

02:37:53.325 --> 02:37:53.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

02:37:54.186 --> 02:37:55.086
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:37:55.106 --> 02:37:55.427
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

02:37:56.307 --> 02:37:58.668
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obviously, you know who, Legend of Zaku.

02:37:58.708 --> 02:37:59.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku.

02:37:59.509 --> 02:37:59.789
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

02:38:00.916 --> 02:38:07.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Nah, nothing much, just celebrating, just bringing in the new year with mediocrity and just a boring weekend, generally.

02:38:08.597 --> 02:38:09.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

02:38:10.438 --> 02:38:12.178
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you celebrate?

02:38:12.578 --> 02:38:14.098
[SPEAKER_03]: What types of games did you play?

02:38:15.079 --> 02:38:15.959
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, for New Year's?

02:38:16.079 --> 02:38:17.119
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's simple.

02:38:17.199 --> 02:38:20.119
[SPEAKER_08]: Drunken Left 4 Dead, after the ball dropped.

02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:20.840
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:24.460
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's one of those games I've got to play still.

02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:28.441
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, definitely playing Left 4 Dead in the dark.

02:38:29.439 --> 02:38:32.061
[SPEAKER_08]: with other people while really hammered up.

02:38:32.722 --> 02:38:35.584
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm worried that game will actually make me shit my pants.

02:38:36.204 --> 02:38:38.125
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I'm worried about with that game.

02:38:38.666 --> 02:38:42.308
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing compared to the other classical movies like Dawn of the Dead.

02:38:43.069 --> 02:38:46.091
[SPEAKER_08]: Although it would be cool if they had a mall map for Left 4 Dead.

02:38:46.771 --> 02:38:47.952
[SPEAKER_08]: Give it that authentic feeling.

02:38:48.873 --> 02:38:51.755
[SPEAKER_08]: But besides that, that's the only excitement I had last week.

02:38:52.415 --> 02:38:54.216
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything else afterwards has just been ho-hum.

02:38:55.493 --> 02:39:00.694
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, money's tight, so if I don't have money to go out, I might as well stay at home.

02:39:00.935 --> 02:39:03.795
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you looking forward to most in 2009?

02:39:05.996 --> 02:39:07.676
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me see.

02:39:07.796 --> 02:39:24.521
[SPEAKER_08]: Besides digital life hopefully coming back, other things, you know, E3 being open to the public and all, hopefully other companies not getting the axe, and generally just damn good games coming out.

02:39:25.319 --> 02:39:33.583
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope Sony could definitely make it the year of the PS3, unlike the critics who've already said that.

02:39:35.237 --> 02:39:40.000
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already said that sort of thing last year and the year before that, and it went wrong.

02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:41.661
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take something big, but who knows?

02:39:42.101 --> 02:39:47.264
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 could be... This is going to be a big, big year for E3.

02:39:47.664 --> 02:39:49.885
[SPEAKER_03]: With E3 going back in the public spectacle.

02:39:50.425 --> 02:39:52.727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's going back to the circus.

02:39:53.087 --> 02:39:54.147
[SPEAKER_03]: You can expect that.

02:39:54.228 --> 02:39:55.988
[SPEAKER_03]: That is going to be one huge thing in 2009.

02:39:56.088 --> 02:39:58.130
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 2009 is going to be bigger than any E3 in the past five years.

02:40:00.931 --> 02:40:18.377
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, look, it could either play as a boon for the ESA or it could be another big clusterfuck like the E3s of years past where you had booth babes, just a lot of game devs basically crunching for that single demo that they're going to showcase on E3.

02:40:18.417 --> 02:40:24.339
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know whether that's worth the effort to actually go back.

02:40:24.859 --> 02:40:27.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Now GameGuru in chat says E3 will bomb and no one will care.

02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:28.740
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:29.100
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:29.801
[SPEAKER_08]: I disagree.

02:40:29.861 --> 02:40:32.001
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's one opinion.

02:40:32.201 --> 02:40:43.005
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess if that person's trying to be realistic given the state of the economy, unless for some reason the economy rebounds over the summer, then you'll see a massive circus like the old ones.

02:40:43.626 --> 02:40:44.966
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's going to be a heck of a circus.

02:40:44.986 --> 02:40:46.087
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it'll still be alive.

02:40:47.307 --> 02:40:52.089
[SPEAKER_08]: Unlike the last year and the 2007 one with just bombs.

02:40:53.009 --> 02:40:55.250
[SPEAKER_08]: Literally ho-hum and just boring as hell.

02:40:56.553 --> 02:41:06.097
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't do nothing to keep it originally as a business expo, whereas the old ones pretty much brought back the hype.

02:41:06.797 --> 02:41:07.757
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the hype right there.

02:41:08.418 --> 02:41:10.458
[SPEAKER_08]: And the hype ended up selling the games.

02:41:12.019 --> 02:41:15.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we will see what develops.

02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:22.443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm being distracted by chat room where a picture of me pretending to kiss DMN at PAX was posted in chat.

02:41:22.483 --> 02:41:23.843
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why that happened.

02:41:23.903 --> 02:41:24.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did that have to happen?

02:41:25.666 --> 02:41:25.966
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:41:26.066 --> 02:41:26.286
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:41:26.786 --> 02:41:28.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, Zaku, thank you so much for your call.

02:41:29.187 --> 02:41:29.567
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:41:29.787 --> 02:41:30.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Later, dude.

02:41:30.207 --> 02:41:30.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

02:41:32.808 --> 02:41:34.288
[SPEAKER_03]: We got time for maybe one more call.

02:41:34.408 --> 02:41:37.769
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAMEOLR.

02:41:37.869 --> 02:41:39.549
[SPEAKER_03]: Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:42.270
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at pictures from people's New Year's party.

02:41:42.310 --> 02:41:43.170
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is this?

02:41:43.210 --> 02:41:44.951
[SPEAKER_03]: You got like five people playing the same game?

02:41:45.591 --> 02:41:46.471
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is this?

02:41:47.171 --> 02:41:47.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Left 4 Dead?

02:41:47.911 --> 02:41:48.972
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what they're all playing?

02:41:50.092 --> 02:41:50.612
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell.

02:41:52.653 --> 02:41:54.433
[SPEAKER_03]: SJ100Mal, what are they all playing in this picture?

02:41:58.837 --> 02:41:59.838
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see.

02:41:59.858 --> 02:42:02.019
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call.

02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:05.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:42:07.343 --> 02:42:08.764
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears 2, thank you.

02:42:08.904 --> 02:42:10.445
[SPEAKER_03]: God, all I needed was a simple answer.

02:42:10.465 --> 02:42:10.985
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:42:12.126 --> 02:42:13.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I get it.

02:42:13.146 --> 02:42:13.827
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I get it now.

02:42:14.687 --> 02:42:15.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:42:16.389 --> 02:42:16.829
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:42:16.929 --> 02:42:18.090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of hard to see the screens.

02:42:19.050 --> 02:42:21.712
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm not seeing the phone ring.

02:42:21.992 --> 02:42:23.233
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it one more minute.

02:42:23.253 --> 02:42:25.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other last minute stories or we're done?

02:42:27.737 --> 02:42:38.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Major Nelson has revealed what the top 20 Xbox downloads were for the top live titles and top arcade titles.

02:42:40.107 --> 02:42:43.090
[SPEAKER_04]: The top arcade titles, starting with...

02:42:44.537 --> 02:42:46.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Castle Crashers Geometry Wars 2 Kingdom for Keflings 5 UNO

02:43:03.714 --> 02:43:17.401
[SPEAKER_04]: 6, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix 7, Fable 2 Pub Games 8, Duke Nukem 3D 9, Bionic Commando Rearmed and 10, Worms Where was Res HD on that list?

02:43:18.341 --> 02:43:18.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was it?

02:43:18.782 --> 02:43:28.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Res HD, not on that list Shameful, shameful Mega Man 9, number 16 Original Doom beat out Mega Man 9

02:43:29.685 --> 02:43:32.847
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Rob D is on the Skype line.

02:43:32.887 --> 02:43:33.408
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Rob?

02:43:34.048 --> 02:43:34.408
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

02:43:34.769 --> 02:43:36.790
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like I've made a good OLR to listen to.

02:43:36.810 --> 02:43:38.911
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time in a while that I actually haven't worked.

02:43:39.572 --> 02:43:42.794
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you guys are just playing the match game, you're knocking soundboards off the table.

02:43:43.014 --> 02:43:44.375
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's been a pretty epic night.

02:43:45.376 --> 02:43:46.076
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

02:43:46.817 --> 02:43:49.218
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to ring in 2009, the only way we know how.

02:43:49.919 --> 02:43:50.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:51.720
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too much.

02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:58.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hear you didn't like HD Remix, and I know that I'm a little bit late on the draw because you talked about HD Remix a couple weeks ago, and...

02:43:59.642 --> 02:44:06.404
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, I'm pretty much in love with the game, so I was just calling in to disagree with you a little bit on that, for the contrasting view.

02:44:06.765 --> 02:44:13.647
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just didn't find that there was, I don't know, like, Street Fighter 2 is one of those things I find that is better left in my memory.

02:44:14.207 --> 02:44:14.767
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

02:44:14.948 --> 02:44:26.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's just not something, I think this is, and I've had time to reflect on what the hell is my big problem with this game anyway, and I think, honestly, what it boils down to is that a lot of my problem with the game is boiled down to the shift to Xbox Live.

02:44:27.592 --> 02:44:29.194
[SPEAKER_03]: and PlayStation Network for these games.

02:44:29.574 --> 02:44:36.202
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it just doesn't have the same magic as it does when you actually walk into an arcade and you get to shit talk someone like right there.

02:44:38.544 --> 02:44:43.469
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's actually standing there next to you because people say things online that they would not say to your face.

02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:47.395
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one thing that I'm quickly learning about Xbox Live.

02:44:47.835 --> 02:44:50.639
[SPEAKER_03]: As for the game itself, I hated the soundtrack.

02:44:50.740 --> 02:44:52.903
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my number one bitch about the game.

02:44:53.463 --> 02:45:00.253
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know they were trying to do the right thing by doing the fan remixes and everything, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the gesture, but the soundtrack was...

02:45:01.014 --> 02:45:01.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Fighter 4

02:45:23.089 --> 02:45:23.369
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

02:45:23.409 --> 02:45:24.290
[SPEAKER_06]: I really did like the originals.

02:45:42.914 --> 02:45:48.978
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great that Capcom actually did go to the guys at GGPO and actually got their help with the netcode.

02:45:49.239 --> 02:45:54.342
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the multiplayer for Street Fighter 2 is... I don't want to call it flawless, because there are a couple problems.

02:45:54.743 --> 02:46:00.367
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, even then, lag does pop up occasionally, but I never thought they'd actually be able to get a fighting game this good online.

02:46:01.517 --> 02:46:13.361
[SPEAKER_06]: and just actually seeing this, actually being able to play Toshin up in Canada or being able to play even Shadowswire across in the UK with no lag or very negligible lag, it blows my mind, frankly.

02:46:14.659 --> 02:46:19.301
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I'm literally playing them in the arcade right next to them as far as the lag goes.

02:46:19.601 --> 02:46:27.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I need to play against more real people I know and not random people because I played this all at a friend's house because I actually don't even own the game.

02:46:27.124 --> 02:46:28.065
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played it on PlayStation 3.

02:46:30.006 --> 02:46:31.146
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I don't know.

02:46:31.466 --> 02:46:35.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, the Xbox 360 controller still is such an issue.

02:46:35.168 --> 02:46:40.310
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if I did get the game, I'd have to get it on PlayStation 3 and even then I don't know a lot of people on there.

02:46:42.096 --> 02:46:48.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been enjoying actually playing a few people from the all-games community and the OLR community over in HD Remix, so that hasn't been so much of a problem for me.

02:46:50.161 --> 02:46:52.102
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a learning curve to actually get used to the controller.

02:46:52.402 --> 02:46:55.944
[SPEAKER_06]: The D-pad is leaving calluses on my thumbs, frankly.

02:46:56.504 --> 02:46:59.186
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had to use the control stick for anyone who's not a Shotokan character.

02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:02.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a lot of OLR people that play Left 4 Dead on PC?

02:47:03.103 --> 02:47:08.847
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is a completely random topic, but I'm kind of curious because I'm actually thinking about getting Left 4 Dead, but on PC, not 360.

02:47:09.448 --> 02:47:12.951
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because first-person shooters, I think I could do better on PC than I can on 360.

02:47:12.991 --> 02:47:14.712
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to throw that out there.

02:47:14.992 --> 02:47:17.634
[SPEAKER_13]: What you can do is join the Steam community.

02:47:17.815 --> 02:47:19.656
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio does have a Steam community.

02:47:19.876 --> 02:47:21.718
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there actually people that are still using it?

02:47:22.078 --> 02:47:22.959
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm on it.

02:47:23.439 --> 02:47:23.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

02:47:23.939 --> 02:47:24.199
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:27.661
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll have to play Left 4 Dead sometime, because I think I'm going to pick that up sooner rather than later.

02:47:28.121 --> 02:47:28.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry.

02:47:28.981 --> 02:47:32.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't mean to disrail what Rob D had originally called in about.

02:47:32.683 --> 02:47:39.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, I noticed the fighting game fans especially really are in love with HD remakes, and maybe I didn't give it a fair look, but I don't know.

02:47:39.266 --> 02:47:42.807
[SPEAKER_03]: It just didn't resonate the way with me that it did the rest of you.

02:47:42.867 --> 02:47:48.750
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe I was just so hyped up for it to be this new and something so different, but it was just kind of like...

02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:50.291
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:47:50.351 --> 02:47:51.772
[SPEAKER_03]: It just felt like a letdown to me.

02:47:52.193 --> 02:47:52.934
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to explain.

02:47:53.474 --> 02:47:59.180
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to Street Fighter 4 as well, and if they actually get the netcode half as good on that game as they did in Street Fighter HD Remix, I'll be happy.

02:47:59.761 --> 02:48:00.302
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that.

02:48:00.322 --> 02:48:02.144
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely looking forward to Street Fighter 4 as well.

02:48:02.184 --> 02:48:03.645
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely pick that up when it comes out.

02:48:03.926 --> 02:48:05.647
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will have that to battle on, if nothing else.

02:48:06.268 --> 02:48:09.772
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing will match the magic of actually playing someone in an arcade right next to them, you know.

02:48:11.242 --> 02:48:20.813
[SPEAKER_06]: The shadiness of the arcade aside, because let's face it, some arcades are better left to our memories rather than to our current sense of smell today.

02:48:21.313 --> 02:48:22.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good point, good point.

02:48:23.530 --> 02:48:23.770
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:30.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Rob D., I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for your call, and have fun battling the fellow listeners online.

02:48:30.895 --> 02:48:31.516
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great to hear.

02:48:31.776 --> 02:48:32.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, you're going down.

02:48:33.017 --> 02:48:33.537
[SPEAKER_06]: See you later.

02:48:33.918 --> 02:48:34.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

02:48:35.198 --> 02:48:37.060
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're already setting up a battle after the show.

02:48:37.380 --> 02:48:45.206
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the great things about doing a radio show like Orange Launch Radio is we are moving into 2009, which, if you can believe it, we started this show in 2002.

02:48:46.286 --> 02:48:52.671
[SPEAKER_03]: So now this is our seventh year of broadcasting, if you can believe it, and it's really neat to see the community growing

02:48:52.731 --> 02:48:54.993
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of built up and that people kind of do this stuff.

02:48:55.033 --> 02:48:57.154
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes what we do here so worthwhile.

02:48:58.255 --> 02:48:59.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Card table's being knocked over and all.

02:48:59.816 --> 02:49:00.516
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of which.

02:49:00.616 --> 02:49:00.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:49:02.838 --> 02:49:06.820
[SPEAKER_13]: Got a message from Ranma with all the people who chipped in on that whiteboard for you guys.

02:49:07.421 --> 02:49:07.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:49:08.442 --> 02:49:09.802
[SPEAKER_03]: I was seeing some stuff in chat.

02:49:09.822 --> 02:49:10.483
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on?

02:49:10.743 --> 02:49:15.026
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that this was just something Ranma got from his connections or something.

02:49:15.866 --> 02:49:17.127
[SPEAKER_13]: We pooled our money together.

02:49:17.167 --> 02:49:17.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

02:49:18.368 --> 02:49:22.491
[SPEAKER_13]: Me, Ranma, Misty, SSJ100Matt, and AlphaCanonogram.

02:49:23.171 --> 02:49:24.471
[SPEAKER_13]: All pitched in to get you the whiteboard.

02:49:44.076 --> 02:49:44.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:50:13.406 --> 02:50:14.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Benny Hill, right?

02:50:14.507 --> 02:50:16.768
[SPEAKER_03]: We're old and dead.

02:50:17.649 --> 02:50:18.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that bad.

02:50:18.089 --> 02:50:19.430
[SPEAKER_05]: We are far from decrepit.

02:50:19.550 --> 02:50:23.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, JTV, I will stop at nothing to get JTV back next week.

02:50:24.253 --> 02:50:24.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in two weeks.

02:50:25.153 --> 02:50:35.720
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to say a very public thank you to Ikuma JP for the webcam that he sent us that I left at my house along with a lot of candy he sent us.

02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:37.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

02:52:09.557 --> 02:52:11.999
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you know, but the listeners, maybe in two weeks.

02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:13.201
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

02:52:14.582 --> 02:52:15.884
[SPEAKER_04]: So tempting.

02:52:16.805 --> 02:52:17.225
[SPEAKER_03]: What is?

02:52:17.606 --> 02:52:17.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

02:52:18.146 --> 02:52:18.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff.

02:52:19.548 --> 02:52:19.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

02:52:20.669 --> 02:52:20.950

[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright.

02:52:27.407 --> 02:52:30.410
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is I need more Jelly Bellies.

02:52:30.470 --> 02:52:31.330
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see this bag?

02:52:31.370 --> 02:52:32.311
[SPEAKER_03]: This bag is empty.

02:52:32.931 --> 02:52:36.914
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs to be filled with more Jelly Bellies because Jelly Bellies are amazing.

02:52:37.254 --> 02:52:40.357
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, next time you're in NorCal, have you ever been to the Jelly Belly Factory, Sauce?

02:52:40.677 --> 02:52:43.459
[SPEAKER_03]: We are so going to the Jelly Belly Factory.

02:52:43.519 --> 02:52:44.600
[SPEAKER_03]: I will take a day off of work, okay?

02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:47.502
[SPEAKER_03]: So you let me know when you're in town next and we'll go to the Jelly Belly Factory, okay?

02:52:47.742 --> 02:52:50.324
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go to M&M's when I'm in Vegas and you can go to Jelly Bellies when you're up here.

02:52:50.604 --> 02:52:50.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:52:51.404 --> 02:52:52.045
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make it work out.

02:52:52.505 --> 02:52:52.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.
