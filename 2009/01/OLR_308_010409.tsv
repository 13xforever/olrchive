13797	21297	Tonight, January 4th, 2009, Xbox avatars get dressed for a rave, is Rock Band getting a LEGO themed expansion?
32349	32829	Snorelax Hey Hey
61997	62698	I'm doing okay.
63038	65881	You know, I was having a conversation about Pokemon and WoW the other day.
65961	66401	Don't ask.
66822	68703	But have you ever seen the Pokemon Jinx?
70165	70845	No.
71085	72847	Jinx looks like a giant drag queen.
72987	73488	Google it.
73608	75349	Google Jinx Pokemon.
75409	76551	It's hilarious.
76831	77311	Anyway, sorry.
78252	79673	Completely random like the rest of the show.
80294	83377	Say hello to our very own drag queen here in studio, Tech Master Loki.
83557	84057	I'm sorry.
84118	85739	You must be talking about Andrew right here.
87920	95182	I'm sorry, I was just imagining you dressed as Tingle because it's seemingly never going to happen, so I just have to imagine it.
96483	96863	How are you?
97443	98323	I'm doing fine.
98383	100924	It could be better if this would work correctly.
101964	103484	Oh yeah, I forgot you have a cam over there.
103545	105685	God, pointed at my worst possible angle.
105705	106305	It's not working.
106485	107225	Oh, that's good.
107966	109786	I don't think the ladies on the couch like to be filmed anyway.
109806	109986	So yeah.
113072	113552	Hi, how are you?
113572	114012	Not bad, not bad.
136735	137255	Cool, cool.
137495	138536	How was your new year?
139556	140157	Pretty quiet.
141037	141637	Champagne.
141697	144779	Got to see how Dick Clark's progressed.
145239	145939	Yeah, not good.
146599	147360	Not good, apparently.
147660	148140	Prognosis?
148160	148800	I'm a little sad about that.
148820	149240	You old.
150461	150821	Yeah.
151321	151662	All right.
152122	163787	Also joining us tonight, all the way from the city that never sleeps, Las Vegas, say hello to Tiara, also known as Sauce.
164226	164666	Hello.
164866	165547	How are you, Sauce?
165807	166628	I'm doing pretty good.
166908	167248	Yeah?
167869	168729	How's Vegas?
169410	170811	It's Vegas-like.
171111	173953	It snowed a couple of weeks ago, and everybody freaked out.
174453	176134	Yeah, it doesn't snow in the desert like ever.
176254	176755	Fun times.
177035	179516	Yeah, but you're spending the week in Sacramento?
179957	181498	Yeah, this is actually my last night here.
181518	182138	No!
182198	183019	Well, how was your New Year's?
183659	184160	It was fun.
184980	186001	We played a lot of rock band.
186348	187509	Yeah, good times.
187850	190872	Now you're at a website now where you talk about all sorts of nerdy things.
191273	193115	So you actually have something to plug tonight.
193175	194296	So why don't you plug away?
194987	201611	Well, I have a game slash comic slash book slash other geeky nerdy stuff.
201631	202451	It's a nerd blog.
202551	203211	It's a total nerd.
203331	204452	Anything nerdy, it's there.
204712	205012	Yeah.
205413	207454	It's avengerstower.com.
207514	214077	And actually, Jamie made an account on there, too, and she's posted a review on some comics.
214737	219880	So it's just kind of a fun place for all of your nerdy stuff to kind of converge together and...
220300	228603	You will probably occasionally see references to that one episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where... Nice, very nice.
228623	229763	Well, best of luck with the blog.
229803	236886	And if you want to see, you know, two cute nerdy girls giggling and screaming about comics and things... No, I'm just kidding.
237626	238166	It's a fun read.
238206	239167	You guys are very good writers.
239227	240267	So, good luck with that.
240547	243608	It's probably even better than OrangeNotesRadio.com, so definitely check it out.
244069	244349	All right.
245609	247351	Let's start off with how was your gaming week?
247431	256178	So, DarkSakura, since you're all big time writing for a big Giggling Girl blog now, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
256298	257159	Giggling Geek Girl.
257660	258080	I like that.
258100	258841	No, I'm just kidding.
258881	258981	No.
259734	271139	I played, of course, Rock Band on New Year's Eve in that crappy Lips game that was full of crap and crappiness and songs that I hate.
273080	277462	See, I would have thought Lips was awesome because it's by the Elite Beat Agents people, but you were not a fan.
277562	280023	It has a bunch of pop bullshit that I hate.
281468	291856	as in when I went in the room and had to ask what is this and who is that then that's a sign that it's stuff that I don't listen to um
294301	297623	You made me play Seeing Star ABBA today.
298023	298963	Yes, it was amazing.
299464	301065	The girls came over before tonight's show.
301125	302986	We sat down with some Seeing Star ABBA.
303626	306188	It was epic, as ABBA would be.
306488	311631	Now, here's the thing about DarkSakura, though, is that she does this whole, like, you know, oh, I don't sing in front of people.
311651	312331	I don't like to sing.
312411	313252	I don't really want to play.
313652	314172	So, you know...
315513	316393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
345146	346847	No, it's okay, okay, okay.
346987	349268	This is the thing, and I'm sure I've explained this before.
349648	354069	I hate hearing out of tune, and I hear myself out of tune, and it drives me nuts.
354649	359851	And I think everyone else can hear it, because I hear it, so I don't really want to do it.
359991	364313	And singing in front of people has been ruined for me forever because of church choir.
365450	365750	I see.
366171	369513	Well, so that explains then why we're shy.
369673	371535	And at least you can change the mic volume.
371935	373116	Yeah, that was helpful.
373136	375318	It's just because I didn't want to hear myself that loud.
376759	377680	But I played other stuff.
377820	380182	I actually turned on Order of Ecclesia and then turned it off.
380962	382663	Because that was when Becky arrived.
382683	386707	Because I was just starting to play and then was like, oh, hi.
387127	388248	So we watched Eddie Izzard.
388988	392931	And then we played a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
393872	395013	and buy a whole crap ton.
395113	396833	I mean a whole crap ton.
397514	398474	It was fantastic.
399014	399314	Four.
400735	401055	Sorry.
405557	406577	What the hell else did I play?
408118	410799	I gotta go to chat room because leave it to chat room to make some
411279	422784	Teehee type comments, chat.orangelandre.com, the ever-present extra guest on the program, Blackwolf, our buddy, who is on right before us at allgames.com, and I should work in this plug for him.
423064	425525	He's starting a new project next week on Friday.
425585	428906	It's Friday Night Gaming, FNG, that effing show.
429006	431788	Now I can actually call it that effing show, and he can't get mad at me.
431848	432348	It's FNG.
433428	455382	Fnglive.net and he has a comment tonight he says the game obviously didn't hear you sing out of tune because that's right you got a high score obviously you weren't out of tune because the game didn't grade you out of tune just had to say that okay but it's it's probably forgiving so she has another reason to be self-deprecating I want ice cream now anyway
455990	456731	I played something else.
456751	456911	Oh yeah!
456931	457371	Big Buck Safari.
457471	457571	What?
487091	490994	We were waiting on our food at the Beach Hut Deli.
492735	494517	Well, they're great.
494657	499340	It's up on Madison out there, on Greenback, wherever.
499861	504404	Anyway, we were waiting on our food and I was like, I want to shoot an elephant!
505705	507647	Because it was the tropical one.
510372	513794	So I got up there, and thank you for the 50 cents, by the way.
516454	519415	You couldn't shoot elephants to start, so I picked a wildebeest.
520256	522296	And kept wanting to shoot the wildebeest.
522697	527618	But they were stupid, and it's like, if you shoot, you can only shoot the buck, you can't shoot the cow.
528058	529219	I said, you shot a cow!
530039	530419	Moo.
531239	532680	But I shot a lion in the ass.
534167	535148	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
550947	556349	I just want to remind people that all these Safari games we play, they're all crap compared to Jumbo Safari, honestly.
556449	558409	Jumbo Safari is great.
558449	563211	Jumbo Safari is one of those amazing, great games that we'll never shut up about here on Orange Lounge Radio.
563531	567172	File it under Guardian Legend and SingStar ABBA because it's right up there.
568345	576551	And then, um, I, I, our Turbo Express is low on battery and we need new batteries for it, but I really wanted to play R-Type on, uh, earlier in the week.
577492	588840	I didn't get to play R-Type, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, I did get, I told you I got Katamari for my iPhone and I played some.
589921	593063	Is it as fail-tastic as a lot of people were saying or did they really fix it?
593123	594044	I heard they fixed some stuff.
594440	595821	It's still kind of hard to control.
595881	597001	I haven't done story mode yet.
597021	600082	I've just been doing endless to get used to the controls.
600822	601723	I don't like tilting it.
601763	608285	I wish that I could just, you know, slide my thumb in one direction and have the Katamari go that way.
608425	609306	But it's alright.
609346	609746	It's not bad.
611364	619226	It actually, I can't really notice a lot of the frame rate problems that people were talking about because the first one kind of had a few of those on its own.
620027	622227	So it really isn't all that big of a deal.
622307	623368	It's an iPhone app.
623708	624308	Deal with it.
624668	624988	Shit.
626148	629049	You know, you want to play Katamari that doesn't have that problem?
629429	630530	Freaking get a PS2.
633971	635791	Alright, I like that review.
636231	637132	It's an iPhone app.
637192	637572	Shit.
637712	638152	Deal with it.
638172	638552	Alright.
640660	642822	I'm going to type that up right now.
643763	644123	You do that.
644144	645345	Put that in the Giggling Girl blog.
645905	646766	Just kidding.
646846	647186	I should.
648187	649349	Let's move on over to Loki.
649429	650870	Loki, how was your gaming week?
651531	652632	My gaming week was okay.
655024	669034	I tried playing some Grand Theft Auto on PC, Grand Theft Auto 4, and for some reason, you know, I was trying to get some of the mods to work, and it just doesn't like doing mods or something.
669334	673217	Even though I'm not really changing much, it's just being retarded, so that's kind of annoying.
673237	679381	But I did get some of the no-gravity stuff to work, but I was trying to do some really fun stuff with it, but oh well.
680021	682183	And then, you know,
682915	689277	Grand Theft Auto 4 on the 360 as well, still playing our bi-daily games.
690518	694399	And I actually tried some new XNA games.
695039	698300	One, though, I really liked was Carnivale.
699001	705183	I can't remember the rest of the title for that, but Carnivale, it's a really weird...
706127	706748	Carneyvale Showtime
725356	726418	All right, sorry, never mind.
726578	727580	Except they are really balloons.
727861	728462	Okay.
728883	737318	No, but you actually, they have these little devices that swing you around stuff, and the whole goal of it is to pop all the balloons and get up to the top of the screen where there's a flaming ring.
738442	739062	Thanks for watching!
762762	764523	So highly recommend you check it out.
764703	766744	I went ahead and purchased it because it was awesome.
766884	769786	So check it out and buy it because it's good.
771107	773108	And very fun, actually, and really colorful.
773608	776810	So for all those people out there that say you hate on community games, not true.
777030	780472	No, this is what I'm saying is they need to be polished.
780932	785415	It's because a lot of the stuff I see on there is not very polished, and that's my problem with it.
786161	791343	You know, so you have to look at games like this and go, oh my god, this is what they could be like.
791383	793004	Then what the hell is everyone else doing?
793404	794505	That's my thing right there.
795325	799947	VidPower in chat says, every time somebody talks about a carnival, I think about that Carnival arcade game.
800268	803109	And yeah, when you said Carnivale, I was thinking of that HBO series.
803449	803949	Carnival?
804069	806090	Did they make a Carnival video game?
806511	807851	No, it's not a Carnival video game.
808171	809032	No, but it's really cool though.
809092	814194	It's easily something though that could be an Xbox Live arcade game.
814614	815915	Which it should be, I think, but
816496	817957	Whatever.
818677	826240	And then other than that, I played a little bit of Dissidia and a little bit of Animal Crossing.
827340	829461	And that's pretty much it.
829601	834243	I was going to try to play some other things this week, but I didn't get around to it.
834883	835363	So that's okay.
836824	838585	My gaming week, you know, same old stuff.
839105	840306	World of Warcraft.
840526	843007	I've now done three wings on 25-man Naxx.
843027	843528	Thank you very much.
844168	845269	Because of our raiding alliance.
845669	845969	Nerd.
846989	847410	But it was fun.
848310	849011	But here's the thing.
849111	853113	Other than that, you know what game I've actually been spending the majority of my game week playing?
853813	855014	It's Seekoden.
855814	858657	Yes, the old school PlayStation 1 game, Suikoden.
858838	860860	And why have I been playing that of all games?
860940	869390	Well, they released it on the PlayStation 3, I think two weeks ago, I think Christmas week, as one of the backwards compatible games that you can play on your PlayStation 3 or the PSP.
869850	871833	And it's kind of a hard to find game now.
872273	874656	It was a collector's item for a little while.
874796	874996	I mean...
876017	878360	Now that it's on PlayStation 3, I'm not sure how that's going to go.
878420	883725	I'm sure the hardcore collectors will still be after it, but those that want to play it now can do so for $6.
884565	887668	So it's cool, because I remember playing the game once a long time ago.
887708	891112	I think I'd rented it, but I didn't really remember it.
891152	893113	One of my really good friends has been on the show before, Shane.
893133	895436	He always raves about Suikoden.
895496	898218	I just knew that a lot of people really liked the game, so I wanted to play it.
898739	898899	So...
900220	901021	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
921380	922181	But I got past it.
922541	924002	But man, did that take persistence.
924322	930926	Basically, there's a boss that's a giant roulette wheel and you step onto it and you land on a square that might be a monster or might be experience.
931186	934368	But you're waiting to land on the square that'll take you to the next room.
934408	936469	But you might have to do the damn thing like 50 times.
936489	937110	I'm not even kidding.
937250	937930	Star Fox did it.
938070	939171	All these random videos.
939872	940312	Terrible.
941394	943335	But otherwise, the game's pretty awesome, actually.
943576	949200	I really like the concept of going around and recruiting people to join your army, because there should be an army of supporters that I have.
950040	952822	Anyway, so that was pretty much my gaming week.
952842	953663	It was a good classic.
953683	954884	Sweet code.
955124	956925	Drew, how was your gaming week?
958011	958451	Pretty good.
958471	960172	I had a cold for most of the week.
960753	961473	Me too.
961673	963494	That's kind of ruined my week too.
964315	967997	I sat and played World of Warcraft.
968557	970038	I'm actually a main tank now.
970478	971719	One of the tanks for my guild.
974361	995436	I took advantage of the Steam sale that happened at the end of the year, picked up some games, finally got Portal, finally played through Portal, I mean 5 bucks, come on, played through Bioshock, got Team Fortress 2, played that a little bit, Enemy Territory Quake Wars, and I'm just starting out on Fallout 3.
996537	999459	So I've been a little busy gaming wise, but it's all been good.
1000100	1005202	Now, Fallout 3 has been one of those games that I want to play eventually, because I've heard so many good things about it.
1005262	1009944	I didn't play Oblivion until a few months after it was out, and I still loved it later, just thinking of Bethesda games.
1010565	1015427	Is Fallout 3 seeming to be worthy of all the praise that's been lavished upon it by the gaming masses?
1016087	1021109	I'll preface this with the fact that I hate Oblivion, but I like Fallout 3.
1021529	1022370	It's a damn good game.
1024793	1030375	It's a little tedious to walk this place and that until you get to fast travel back and forth.
1031576	1036137	But it's pretty good for first-person style Fallout.
1036798	1040719	I kind of miss the holy turn-based thing, but VATS takes care of that quite nicely.
1042620	1042920	Alright.
1043820	1045301	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
1046982	1047522	That's about it.
1048062	1049683	Well then let's move on over to Sauce.
1050263	1050903	Hello, Sauce.
1051103	1051443	Hello.
1051744	1052584	How was your gaming week?
1052604	1052684	Fine.
1052975	1053635	It was good.
1054215	1059676	Earlier in the week, I played a lot of Eternal Sonata, which was... We're having mic issues.
1059976	1061737	If you heard that... No, I don't think it was you.
1061777	1064557	I think it was... One of these mics is on the fritz.
1064597	1065578	It's on its last legs.
1065818	1067118	It's the one I told Andrew to use.
1067398	1067698	Is it?
1068238	1071539	Okay, that makes... Yeah, I think that mic is going to go any day now.
1071599	1072739	So, sorry.
1072779	1074819	If you hear random things, sorry about that.
1074899	1075460	Live radio.
1075900	1076600	It sucks sometimes.
1076760	1077260	Go ahead, Sauce.
1078174	1080376	I played Eternal Sonata, which is fun.
1080576	1090764	I just got an Xbox 360 the day after Thanksgiving, so I'm kind of catching up on games that people have already played before.
1091205	1091905	And that was fun.
1093146	1096809	And then New Year's Eve, we played a lot of Rock Band.
1096949	1103494	I saw Lips, which I thought was pretty cool, because there's a lot of poppy music that Jamie hates, but I thought it was great.
1104375	1104475	Um...
1105976	1110646	Let's see, we played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was fun.
1111769	1115597	I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith with Dan, which was also fun.
1115637	1116339	I like that game.
1118304	1130393	and I wound up waking up like five hours before Jamie or Dan did on New Year's Day so I wound up trying out Fable 2 because I'd never played that and I'm really addicted.
1130433	1138860	I've been waking up before everyone almost every day since I've been here and I've been playing that in the mornings and I accidentally killed my first husband.
1139580	1140781	which was fun.
1141241	1141581	Oops.
1142542	1156769	I forgot he was following me and I went to go do a quest to kill bandits and I accidentally got him killed so then I remarried and then I moved into a nicer house and then in the gypsy camp I found a lesbian who was in love with me so I married her also.
1158730	1162252	Yeah, I got a bigamist achievement for that so it was fun.
1162573	1163013	Cool.
1166815	1168876	So yeah, that was pretty much my gaming week.
1169494	1170114	and I'll see you next time.
1187870	1188590	Wow, anyhow.
1190631	1195513	Let's move on talking about some podcast updates and the show.
1196413	1197833	There is no show next week.
1197873	1201655	Just a reminder, we will not be here live next week, January 11th.
1202515	1204296	That's because we're on vacation.
1204376	1208937	I'll be out of the state, and I think everybody else just wants a week off after the holidays.
1209017	1211098	So enjoy your night off from OLR.
1212078	1213239	We will be back, however, on the 18th.
1231687	1241792	So now, let's get into tonight's news and stuff, and we'll get into a game later on, which some of our chatters can play, and possibly win a fabulous prize.
1242112	1243173	We'll talk more about that later.
1243893	1245774	Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?
1246094	1247755	Alright, well guess what?
1248996	1258740	The Nielsen Company has done a bunch of different polls, and one of those polls that they have tabulated was, what was the most played game console for 2008?
1261072	1262433	Well, congratulations, Sony.
1262573	1264095	It was the PlayStation 2.
1265896	1275004	And that had 31.2% of the market share, which is not surprising because it still has the largest market share of game consoles out there right now.
1276185	1286114	Number two was the Xbox 360 with 17.2%, followed by the Wii with 13.4%, which is interesting because there are more Wii consoles out there.
1287728	1289028	Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360, Xbox 360,
1310798	1311018	Ouch.
1312139	1312920	That's too bad.
1313901	1315962	And then, of course, GameCube with 4.6%.
1316322	1319165	So, hey, at least they're beating the GameCube.
1322567	1324529	I noticed handhelds aren't ranked in there, though.
1325970	1331154	Yeah, because I think they're talking about home console and, you know, I don't know.
1331294	1333195	They just didn't consider handhelds, I guess.
1334326	1338232	Because if you talk about handhelds, then you've got to do the iPhone, maybe.
1339475	1341438	We'll just ignore the handhelds.
1342688	1347150	Alright, well, do you think things might change in 2009?
1347590	1350371	Do you think at some point something's got to overtake the PlayStation 2 eventually?
1350731	1352811	I'm kind of surprised the Wii wasn't higher up there.
1352831	1354012	I mean, I am and I'm not.
1354452	1360154	Obviously the Wii's biggest problem is that once the novelty of Wii Sports and all that wears off, it kind of just sits there and gathers dust.
1360714	1367196	But, you know, there's still a lot of families, especially at Christmas time, that are all playing Wii Sports together and stuff, you know?
1367957	1369277	But, you know,
1370458	1375481	Would you rather be, I mean, would people be playing Wii Sports for like six hours a day?
1375741	1380004	I mean, there's some people, obviously, they'll play more hardcore like RPGs and stuff like that.
1380545	1381845	Like Fallout, you know.
1383566	1387749	And, you know, Fallout, they could be playing that for hours at a time and that just kind of goes right by.
1387809	1391432	But the Wii doesn't really have anything that takes up tons of time.
1392192	1395274	I mean, Animal Crossing, but hell, that gets boring after a couple hours, so.
1397435	1399777	It's not really that big of a surprise.
1401345	1406348	I guess all those people that are playing Wii Fit or not playing Wii Fit or not playing Wii Music.
1407829	1408250	Very funny.
1413633	1416595	Rob has escaped us.
1416695	1418897	Sorry, live radio folks.
1418937	1425722	I tried to go fix the network by plugging in the extender, which I had unplugged earlier in the week because it was causing me issues with the PlayStation 3.
1428350	1432313	Boy, 2009, not off to a good start in regards to technical difficulties, is it?
1432353	1433975	We have mic issues and network issues.
1434656	1435276	Good lord.
1435777	1443544	Hey, but one thing that's not having issues, it's growing and growing, is XNA and the community games on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1443844	1445746	What are you laughing about over there, Sauce?
1446266	1447647	My lame transitions or what?
1448388	1448708	Okay.
1448728	1449029	Okay.
1450842	1459588	Anyhow, hey, obviously there are just tons and tons and tons of games on the community games list, and it's kind of hard to figure out what is good and out there to download.
1459628	1467773	I mean, you know, obviously there's a lot of good stuff out there, but there's some also not good stuff out there, so trying to be able to sort it all can be a challenge.
1468194	1474818	Well, this website, Gamerbytes.com, actually decided to put together their top 10 XNA community games of 2008.
1475859	1478360	It's from Gamerbytes.com.
1478561	1480222	They say GalaxEmail.
1481182	1484624	Monaco 360, which looks a little bit like Rally X to me.
1484684	1485324	I don't know about that.
1485644	1487025	It's a remake of Monaco.
1487045	1488505	Oh, it's a remake of Monaco GP.
1489206	1490306	Okay.
1490386	1492647	Cave-In was eight.
1492807	1493908	Star Pilot was seven.
1493968	1495088	Weapon of Choice was six.
1495568	1497169	Hexothermic was five.
1497689	1498890	Duo Tricks was four.
1499430	1501731	Johnny Platform's Biscuit Romp was three.
1501751	1503212	I almost downloaded that today.
1503252	1504052	Biscuit Romp?
1504452	1505553	Ultratron Ultratron Ultratron
1529790	1534891	How sad, though, that our buddy Aaron and his game Snake360 did not make the list, but maybe next year.
1534971	1535592	He must have been number 11.
1536452	1536772	I don't know.
1537312	1537852	Maybe next year.
1538172	1548455	It's unfortunate because there's probably so many games out there right now, and there's nothing really to... I mean, you can look at the top downloads and stuff like that, but it's kind of skewed sometimes.
1549015	1549095	Yeah.
1549115	1549215	Yeah.
1550546	1550866	I don't know.
1550886	1551527	Yeah, it can be.
1552007	1556429	I wonder if anybody's figured out a way to kind of like stack the deck.
1557070	1557630	You know what I mean?
1557670	1560471	Like if somebody's figured out a way to cheat that system yet or anything like that.
1561032	1562432	Download the trial a bunch of times?
1562492	1562853	I don't know.
1564293	1566695	Do you think it would require unique accounts or what?
1567455	1567775	Maybe.
1567875	1568196	I don't know.
1569116	1575199	But Jamie, that one game, the Biscuit Challenge or whatever, that's only 200 Microsoft points to download.
1575439	1577180	It looks kind of like a neat little platformer game.
1577541	1579982	Maybe I'll have to invest and challenge the biscuits.
1580506	1582147	You hear that, Fireplace Sim?
1582727	1583867	200 Microsoft points.
1584407	1585548	Don't need to be 500.
1585808	1588789	That's ridiculous for stupid, fake-looking fire.
1590129	1590429	Alright.
1591509	1593950	Well, I'll have to check some of these out.
1593970	1599012	I've been falling behind on the community games, and I keep meaning to stay on top of them, but... Seriously, Carnivale.
1599132	1599512	It's awesome.
1599692	1601753	Alright, I'll definitely make it a point to check that one out.
1601933	1604333	I even bought a bigger hard drive so I could download more games.
1604513	1606154	So, I swear I will at some point.
1606534	1607654	They actually had some pretty cool stuff.
1607674	1609555	They had a music-making program on there now.
1610148	1610768	Which is kind of neat.
1610788	1612509	I'll have to check it out.
1613089	1615851	Well, how about some other top tens?
1616271	1618972	And this is Eurogamer's top ten games.
1620072	1622814	So we're looking a little bit to the overseas opinion.
1623254	1628116	But number ten was World of Goo, which is WiiWare and PC.
1628216	1633678	And it's actually something that I was really interested in, just because it looks so bizarre.
1636940	1640581	The next one is Guitar Hero World Tour for 9th place.
1643723	1645944	I have to use your slow internet to get to the next page.
1646104	1646344	Really?
1646504	1651166	There was a lot of people hating on Guitar Hero World Tour when I talked to them.
1651507	1652727	This is Europe.
1653027	1653868	I know, but still.
1653888	1655568	It's not like it's a completely different game.
1655728	1656609	It's interesting.
1657398	1658698	Gears of War 2 Gears of War 2
1682645	1683145	Grand Theft Auto 4
1711708	1712669	You all knew it would be up there.
1713910	1715411	Moving on to number two.
1716372	1720675	Number two is Fallout 3, which is pretty darn awesome.
1721356	1722817	And number one is LittleBigPlanet.
1724258	1726420	Excellent choice for LittleBigPlanet.
1726440	1728001	But I didn't hear Rock Band 2.
1730303	1733325	So they put Guitar Hero World Tour on this list, but they didn't put Rock Band 2 on there?
1733885	1734546	That's interesting.
1734766	1736988	Or did Rock Band 2 not get released over there yet?
1737608	1738229	I don't even know.
1738249	1738969	I thought they got it.
1741516	1744017	I thought they didn't have nearly the delay we had over here.
1744537	1745378	Very interesting.
1746638	1750460	Maybe they were feeling... This is just one particular website, obviously.
1750480	1751581	It's not the whole country's opinion.
1751981	1758324	But maybe this particular website was put off by the fact it felt like more of an upgrade to the previous Rock Band game.
1758924	1767368	There was this story, kind of tied in with this too, that Peter Moore was pissed off at EA because FIFA didn't make the list.
1769221	1769641	How so?
1769661	1770502	How so?
1789833	1790053	Yeah.
1790834	1793836	Well, maybe that's just a hint to, you know, do... I don't know.
1793876	1799200	I didn't play the game, so I don't know if it's good or not, but you know, maybe it's just a hint to do better next time?
1800341	1800621	Maybe.
1801522	1811350	Well, PS3 may not have led as far as console game playing share, but they are leading in one thing, and that is web browsing.
1812391	1816414	Between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii, PlayStation 3 has won.
1817034	1817855	They actually have
1818732	1819192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1844941	1848745	Yeah, what do people actually browse the web for on their TV?
1848825	1851947	I mean, I can't imagine checking my email on the TV and stuff.
1851967	1852908	That would just be terrible.
1853048	1854990	YouTube and PornoTube, that's pretty much it.
1855130	1856371	Exactly what I was going to say.
1856431	1859114	YouTube and XTube are pretty much all I can think of.
1859154	1859774	And I will say this.
1860175	1860575	I actually...
1861716	1862697	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1889485	1910109	That you, you know, develop the weed Don't give a shit about online I see, I see And then I saw the jizz in my pants thing And it wasn't as funny as they made it out to be, I have to say But it was still kind of funny Anyway, if you have no idea what I'm talking about Google it or something Oh What?
1910809	1918851	Totally unrelated, but They have a new Charlie the Unicorn that they did for YouTube Live It's hilarious It's short, though
1919602	1921184	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1931764	1943427	Well, we've been keeping our eye on the game blogs this week, and one thing that caught our eye on one of the game blogs was this story on Joystick about a study that buff game characters apparently give men a negative body image.
1943787	1944867	And, you know, this is interesting.
1944907	1945807	You know why this is interesting?
1945847	1952729	Because we hear all the freaking time about, you know, women and the supermodels and the wafer-thin looks and, you know...
1953089	1954170	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1972245	1986273	and apparently they're quoting a study from researchers at Kansas State University and apparently what the study showed is that if you view extreme body images in games I don't know what that means extreme body images in games like is there like
1988490	1988871	DarkSakura
2003650	2004391	Anyway, I don't know.
2004731	2019385	Anyhow, but they say 15 minutes of seeing these extreme body images, it's enough to give both males and females, so it's not just, you know, here we go with women again, sadly, unfortunately, having to look at this in the media, giving them a negative impression of their own body image.
2019705	2020486	Oh, that's bullshit.
2020886	2021307	I'm sorry.
2021327	2022168	You think it's all bullshit?
2022188	2022928	That is bullshit.
2023008	2024550	I play games with, you know,
2025925	2027086	That's an N64 game.
2055322	2060606	The Rock, Big Boss Man, and The Undertaker
2080802	2082063	Wrestling or gay porn?
2082083	2082863	You be the judge.
2082943	2083503	Seriously.
2083543	2085884	Like, I don't watch a lot of wrestling, but damn.
2086545	2087405	Big Boss Man?
2088786	2091047	Like, I think I saw him at Folsom Street Fair.
2091547	2092627	Big Boss Man was awesome.
2093168	2093848	I'm just saying.
2096209	2100111	By the way, the second study was women and they had to play a beach volleyball game.
2100671	2103372	Well, that's probably DOA beach volleyball right there.
2103432	2104113	Seriously.
2104193	2104513	I mean...
2108202	2115384	And then the story goes on to say, both male and female subjects viewed their own bodies more negatively after completing a cycle at the game control.
2115725	2121647	He said the immediacy of reaction by game players was disturbing because video games are such a powerful element of popular culture.
2121967	2125428	But here's the weird thing is that they were playing like sports video games.
2126288	2126868	It's stupid.
2126888	2128389	To me, they probably...
2129497	2131298	I don't think there's anyone that goes and plays a game of like...
2155399	2163127	I don't know, Conan or something like that and then goes and cries because their body is like, you know, pathetic compared to that.
2163487	2168632	Well, you know, I don't want to look like some of these, you know, big guys because I don't want to be addicted to steroids and crack.
2168832	2172636	Although I do have to say, though, playing games with lots of guns makes me want to own guns.
2172736	2173276	So there is...
2174244	2176626	There is, you know, that correlation.
2176786	2180550	I wouldn't say that because there's a lot of people out there that are going to use that.
2180630	2183212	You know, like, oh, it just incites violence.
2183592	2188216	See, this guy on this radio show says now he wants a gun because he plays games with guns.
2188556	2189517	So he's going to shoot.
2189577	2190638	Oh, my God.
2190878	2192740	I bought a G36C.
2192900	2195783	So now I've got that to go along with my shotgun and my P90.
2197381	2198081	Wow.
2198802	2200082	Oh, and my high cap of 5.1.
2200122	2201642	Wow.
2201843	2204363	It's a hobby that I really shouldn't be getting into.
2205244	2206104	All right.
2206184	2206724	Let's see.
2207424	2208985	I'm reading some comments from chat room.
2209005	2212026	SSJ100Matt says, did the N64 just get released in Kansas?
2212766	2213947	Apparently, I don't know.
2214427	2215888	This story had to have butchered something.
2218109	2220370	Kazzaum, I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.
2220550	2224571	Kazzaum says, I bet every woman wishes they could jiggle their boobs like that.
2224952	2226973	Probably referencing Dead or Alive.
2227733	2229094	I would think that would hurt.
2229674	2236037	I've never had boobs and I don't really want to, but I would think that if you jiggle them a lot, it would really start to hurt.
2236317	2238758	Because if I were to try and jiggle my balls...
2241445	2243688	That would probably hurt after a little while.
2246872	2248133	Does it hurt if you run naked?
2250636	2251837	No, it feels quite free.
2254727	2255407	Well, I don't know.
2255467	2256127	Let me try.
2256147	2261208	Wow, they were playing the old game.
2261248	2265349	I thought it might have been mistyped or something like that, but it's actually WWF.
2265449	2268270	I mean, WWF hasn't been around for a while now.
2268410	2269130	I know, I know.
2269150	2271250	This is amazing reporting, Doug.
2271270	2276511	Yeah, but if you've played one of those wrestling games, you've played them all, they're all pretty much exactly the same.
2276651	2280712	So that's probably all they could afford with our dying economy in Kansas.
2281902	2284864	in between the ramen and all that.
2286045	2286325	Nice.
2288287	2289668	Seriously, just rent a game.
2289768	2290628	I mean, God.
2292089	2293811	It's like, 1964, what is this?
2295052	2295652	I don't remember that.
2297613	2297914	All right.
2299174	2300475	Anyhow, sorry, I...
2303834	2308876	PressLol is in chat, a co-host of Saturday Night's Understation Live here on All Games.
2309196	2311656	He's screaming, Photoshop robs balls.
2312036	2313217	Why would you want to do that?
2313917	2314177	Why?
2315197	2317118	Why would you even suggest that people do that?
2317178	2321119	Unless you're talking about playing pool and billiard balls.
2321539	2322660	That's okay.
2323380	2324280	Or beach balls.
2324760	2326161	Maybe I'm going on a trip to the beach.
2326201	2327061	I need a beach ball.
2327685	2334951	or I'm at Walmart and I'm standing in front of one of those big cages full of balls and I'm trying to undo the thing at the bottom so that they all roll out onto the floor.
2336452	2337252	That's okay.
2338473	2340895	But whatever you're suggesting is not okay.
2341215	2342877	Because we all know billiards is gay.
2343337	2344998	Anyhow, shut up.
2345018	2346319	I like knocking around some balls.
2346840	2348801	Who doesn't like to knock around some balls once in a while?
2349822	2351123	Hey, let's move on with some gaming news.
2351710	2365137	Well, for those of us who are Xbox owners and are really enjoying the whole, you know, Avatar thingy that's going around, there's some new accessories to be coming out.
2365237	2366637	Actually, different Avatar clothing.
2369446	2370707	Your phone talks funny!
2371647	2372947	Sorry, I'm yelling at Sauce.
2373067	2374368	Her phone just went off in studio.
2375008	2379570	Well, there's basically a rave pack that's going to be coming out.
2380290	2389154	For the boys, there's a pixel art hoodie, a rave baseball cap, pink sweatbands, green skinny fit jeans, and dark purple jeans.
2390273	2391694	I'm sure that you can't use that for the girls.
2392494	2406684	For the girls, there's a green chunky ring, a red chunky ring, yellow fingerless gloves, blue fingerless gloves, chunky beaded bracelet, Dayglo zebra print pumps, and rave baseball cap, and none of that sounds.
2415249	2417851	Now you can add your very own rave on your Xbox!
2420035	2421456	The boys stuff sounds better.
2423157	2423878	Fuck a bunch of that.
2449181	2452482	I'm not sure if I should take offense to that or not, but whatever, it was funny.
2453682	2454002	Alright.
2454542	2458544	Yeah, I mean, seriously, there's a clear difference between gay and rave.
2459624	2461464	Well, at a rave, everyone's kind of gay.
2461704	2464785	Like, I don't know if you've ever actually been to a rave, but like, come on.
2465786	2467186	A cuddle room, Loki.
2468246	2471487	A lot of raves have a cuddle room, where everybody, you know what they do?
2472167	2472788	They cuddle.
2473568	2473988	All night.
2475031	2475792	That's kind of gay.
2475812	2478336	Several of your parties have a cuddle room.
2478376	2481501	Yeah, but I'm gay, so it's understandable.
2482422	2488572	Yeah, they want to grope the easy chicks, and they're all high on ecstasy, so why not?
2491582	2494807	Alright, everybody's happy when they're on ecstasy.
2495428	2500035	Alright, let's move on with some more news, please, before we get letters from angry parents.
2500556	2504602	Square Enix is bringing their next epic game to Xbox Live Arcade.
2505529	2508910	Will it feature Cloud or possibly any other Final Fantasy characters?
2509411	2512232	No, because it's not an epic game, it's a puzzle game instead.
2512572	2513972	It's Yosemin Live.
2514072	2516573	We'll be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2517194	2521395	The game kind of looks a little bit like Bajul, except you're supposed to be making triangles out of the characters.
2522496	2526337	And it looks like everything has frowny faces on it.
2526698	2529599	So it's one very unhappy puzzle game.
2530439	2533021	If everything didn't have faces, you wouldn't want to punch it Good point, good point
2554557	2562422	I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious because the smile on the block is better than mine and I'm going to have to go see a counselor because of that because I'm having issues.
2562743	2565484	Body image issues from USMN Live.
2567706	2569567	I want my hair to be as spiky as clouds.
2569627	2570388	I'm having issues.
2572554	2596353	but apparently they're going to have this game come out also on the PlayStation Network at some point as well but right now it's been confirmed for Xbox Live Arcade because there's a shot that shows achievements so that's their hypothesis I guess I'm sorry, here's the comment of 2009 in our chat room right now and I can say that because we're only what, like four days into 2009?
2597454	2602018	SSJ100Matt says the cuddle room is like the champagne room there's no sex going on
2605639	2611243	Be Good Johnny by Men at Work and Let's Groove by Earth, Wind & Fire
2629335	2630956	I'll probably have to pick it up
2649690	2650330	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2665376	2666716	Yes, and here's what I want to see.
2666736	2672418	I want to see someone import in Max 300 or something like that and see how that works.
2672838	2673978	Because that would be funny.
2674379	2675919	There are no lyrics to Max 300.
2675959	2677419	That's why it's funny.
2678420	2679360	That's the whole point.
2679400	2682201	That's the only song that Matt would sing in karaoke anymore.
2682221	2683301	No, I wouldn't sing it at all.
2684641	2691583	Seriously, like Orange Lounge Radio, if nothing else, this show has accomplished single-handedly destroying karaoke for Loki.
2692184	2693204	And he'll never sing it again.
2693933	2698074	You can't really destroy something that wasn't ever really built up in the first place.
2698434	2698754	I see.
2699935	2701515	Alright, anyhow, check it out if you want.
2703035	2709277	Well, there is a reward, I should say.
2709577	2711137	Or maybe a gift.
2712118	2718239	But there is an Xbox 360 Military Appreciation Bundle.
2718379	2719960	I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
2720020	2721680	It's an Appreciation Bundle.
2723507	2725569	Typo on the damn page.
2726370	2728072	No, it's a typo on the damn box.
2728472	2731836	Oh my god, it is a typo on the box.
2733317	2733698	Wow.
2735640	2737782	But you want to know what's even more hilarious about this?
2738063	2738543	Sorry, go ahead.
2739324	2739965	First of all,
2742407	2750715	First of all, it's $299.95, and it's the pack that comes with Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda.
2751897	2757783	But they also sold this at Best Buy for the same price.
2758183	2759825	But they include Blue Dragon now.
2761206	2763068	No, the one we bought was the same thing.
2765042	2768745	So they're basically unloading all their excess copies of Blue Dragon that didn't sell?
2768925	2769225	I don't know.
2769365	2771187	Well, no, there's no Blue Dragon in this pack.
2771667	2774749	This is the same one that Best Buy was selling for Christmas.
2775490	2779452	I'm looking at the dog tag in the corner and sure enough, Military Appreciation.
2779813	2782154	Oh yeah, sorry, Blue Dragon is included with that one.
2782194	2783836	Sorry, it was really tiny.
2785116	2785677	There you have it.
2786457	2786878	But still.
2787678	2790160	But what exactly, where does the money go to?
2790460	2791281	To appreciate them.
2793143	2798064	Is it going to a charity or is this like are they selling this like in a particular area of Texas?
2798344	2799884	They're selling it on the military basis.
2800645	2803005	Yeah, it was the PX.
2803865	2805566	So it's a cheap marketing thing and nothing more.
2805626	2809407	It's no donation to a military society or veterans fund.
2809467	2810247	We want money.
2810407	2811167	Here, your board.
2811527	2811627	Ah.
2812567	2812927	The end.
2813207	2813687	Interesting.
2813927	2814108	Yep.
2816328	2820369	It's not only do you get the Xbox 360 with three games, but you get another free game
2821308	2822308	That's like worth 20 bucks.
2823069	2823429	If that.
2825610	2827330	But you don't pay any taxes on base.
2827631	2828711	Military personnel don't.
2828751	2833073	So that's another added incentive to buy it on base rather than off base.
2833293	2835674	And if that's the cheapest one, then why not?
2836674	2837475	I guess that's a good point.
2838615	2842216	Because tax can really add up on some of those multi-hundred dollar purchases.
2842697	2843017	Good point.
2843477	2843597	Yeah.
2844810	2846492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2864529	2877813	One new way that's been pointed out by Popular Science is that you can actually download a freeware program to use an outdated wireless router and use that as a wireless gaming receiver as well.
2878954	2883155	And of course that will cost you whatever you can find for a cheap router for.
2883815	2892118	Or, as I've been reading as well, you can actually use the original Xbox wireless gaming receiver which is under $50.
2894389	2908057	interesting or pretty much any wireless gaming receiver out there that's probably cheaper than $99.99 yeah I paid $99.99 for my little wireless gaming receiver it's not an official Xbox one but it's like a third party one that will also work with my PS2 which is why I bought it um
2908956	2928462	but man, that was $100 just so I can use One reason, one thing I will give props to the PlayStation 3 for as hard of a time as I've given that system in the past I didn't have to set anything up well, yeah, I had to go through a setup but there was no wireless thing, it has built-in wireless on it like they all should Mine doesn't Really?
2929222	2938185	It's a 20 gig Oh, that's right I forgot they didn't all have that I also don't have the fancy memory card ports for, you know
2938720	2939701	I don't think mine has that either.
2939821	2940282	I don't remember.
2940322	2940882	You don't either.
2941062	2941303	Yeah.
2941843	2942644	What do you use them for?
2943344	2944085	All right, anyhow, sorry.
2944245	2946327	I just thought I'd bring that up.
2946427	2951753	Anyhow, you know, a lot of us have those Xbox 360 HD drives.
2952673	2954135	And we're not really using them anymore.
2954155	2957959	I don't know about you guys, but I actually unplugged mine because I have maybe like seven movies.
2958259	2959160	I don't even really watch them.
2959580	2960641	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2978680	2980342	I don't know if this is just the...
2994698	2998281	HD DVD player, or if you do this with the actual Xbox 360?
2998522	2999903	No, it's the HD DVD player.
3000363	3000783	Oh, okay.
3001404	3006528	Basically, you break it apart, and you can take the blue diode out of it, and you hook it up.
3006948	3013774	They showed it basically hooked up to a laser sight on a gun, but pretty much anything that has a laser emitting diode.
3014234	3016336	You can make your own burning laser out of it.
3016536	3016796	Yes.
3017057	3019098	Like a shark with a freaking laser beam on its head.
3019138	3020159	You can actually make your own.
3020539	3021260	Shark not included.
3021280	3021340	Yes.
3021380	3026924	Yeah, basically you take the diode out and you build this really small chip that goes with it.
3026964	3033069	You hook that up and voila, burning laser that can pop balloons and burn paper.
3033089	3034090	Can it melt faces?
3034330	3036512	If it can't melt faces, it's worthless.
3036652	3041656	It might hurt if you leave it on someone's face for a while, but I don't know if it can melt faces.
3041756	3042397	Ow, ow, that hurts.
3042457	3043317	Get that dot off my head.
3043497	3044098	Ow, ow, ow.
3044659	3051722	Just as a disclaimer, please do not try Lasik surgery at home by yourself using your HD DVD drive.
3052119	3054600	Orange Launch Radio does not endorse you actually doing this.
3054720	3059861	It's just kind of cool that you can make a face-melting laser out of your Xbox 360.
3059921	3070184	And if you don't want to break apart your HD-DVD drive because of signal-melting value or anything like that, you can either buy your own burning laser or you can buy a laser diode for $50.
3071424	3073985	Shaoran in chat says, laser cats can be a reality.
3075025	3076446	I would not give this to my cat.
3077881	3078762	Take it to her head.
3079082	3080743	It's like, kitty, ah!
3081483	3084785	I would come home and it would look like a BB gun army ran through my house.
3086086	3087527	The house would be on fire.
3088588	3089288	For real.
3089949	3091289	Do not give this to a cat.
3091410	3094992	If you give this to a cat, you're beyond an idiot.
3095172	3098914	They're staring at the birds outside and saw, poof!
3102236	3102656	Ah, yes.
3104097	3104978	All sorts of awesome.
3105987	3107929	You come home in the fish tank spoiling.
3109430	3112553	I don't think that would happen, but yeah.
3112573	3113374	Something to that effect.
3113394	3114355	The fish would be dead.
3114515	3116818	Her food would be toasty.
3116938	3120001	The birds would be on the ground, missing feathers.
3121182	3122963	Pew, pew, pew, mew, mew, mew.
3124821	3125862	James Bond's weapon of choice, the Walter PPK.
3125882	3129487	We're not going to use the real gun, but a high-performance semi-automatic CO2 version.
3144429	3149150	To make it burn, we need an Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.
3149610	3150150	Let's take a look.
3150170	3154771	I don't know where this video comes from, but I see a little logo for Break in the corner, so we'll just leave it at that.
3154871	3155931	Is there like an embed thing?
3157152	3159712	I don't know what the hell site this is, so whatever.
3159952	3160632	Let's play the rest of it.
3160653	3161093	Get apart.
3161593	3164373	The side panel snaps off and reveals some hidden screws.
3164793	3165213	Oh, you're right.
3165253	3166274	Break.com.
3166294	3167614	Get to work and remove all of them.
3168172	3172537	After popping off the cover, it's time to get rid of some more screws until the DVD drive is freed up.
3172557	3173758	Okay, I want to see them burn stuff.
3173778	3175139	I don't care about the whole process.
3175159	3176120	It's boring.
3176240	3178563	Now the laser assembly gets attached to the Walther.
3185204	3201091	Oh my god, if I were still smoking cigarettes, which I don't encourage anyone to do because it's very addicting and I quit, but if I were still smoking cigarettes, what an awesome way to light my cigarette.
3201572	3204633	Hold on guys, I gotta get my gun to light my cigarette.
3205706	3206648	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3217788	3223049	Sorry, just had to dream I was a super spy for a minute with all these kinds of cool gadgets.
3224090	3227971	But yeah, I won't be getting one of these anytime soon because I'm sure there's laws against it.
3228051	3231171	However, there are some cool new games I could be getting pretty soon.
3232392	3235192	But I'd have to travel to Europe to get some of these games.
3235593	3236253	Right, DarkSakura?
3237573	3238733	Actually, no, nothing.
3239694	3240034	Nothing?
3240174	3241114	There's nothing I can buy?
3241624	3242525	Nothing on the list.
3242985	3244206	Well, then I guess I get my laser.
3244226	3244886	Not until the 16th.
3245046	3246007	I guess I get my laser.
3246527	3247868	Do we have any releases in the U.S.?
3248169	3251071	Yes, there are some crappy releases coming to the U.S.
3252031	3255874	The first being Paws and Claws Pampered Pets for the Nintendo DS.
3256955	3261518	Man, that's an ugly looking picture there with chihuahuas and ugly cats.
3262198	3263279	They're all ugly characters.
3263679	3266902	Paws and Claws Pet Resort, the same game but now on the Wii.
3268343	3271345	Bigfoot Collision Course on the Nintendo DS.
3271685	3273006	No pets involved with that one.
3273527	3276869	Elebits, The Adventures of Kai and Zero on the DS.
3276989	3281233	The sequel to the cool 3D game and now this is more like Pokemon.
3282514	3285656	Moon is coming out from Mastiff on the Nintendo DS.
3286677	3289419	Fishing Master World Tour on the Nintendo Wii.
3290440	3294143	Jumble Madness, another fun puzzle game on the DS.
3295664	3296605	And let's see here.
3298561	3300831	Neighborhood Games on Nintendo Wii
3302377	3307359	Personal Trainer Math from Nintendo, because Nintendo thinks you don't know math.
3307699	3311501	Can I interrupt these shitty games with a funny chatroom comment?
3311901	3312061	Sure.
3312081	3317023	I mean, as much as I'm sure our listening audience cares about all these fucking math games, this is just too funny.
3318083	3324385	Because, you know, we're a little bit delayed, so sometimes our comments on the previous story take a little while to run through chat, so a comment on the whole laser thing.
3324866	3328427	Shaoran in chat says, Imagine holding up a convenience store with that.
3328827	3330828	Give me the money or I'll fucking laser your face.
3335256	3338099	Sloth's Radio does not condone these actions.
3338419	3340241	You could brand somebody with a laser.
3342103	3343024	Okay, sorry, Loki.
3343064	3345908	Continue telling us about the edutainment titles of plenty coming out this week.
3345928	3346628	No, that's actually it.
3346828	3347269	Oh, okay.
3347749	3347950	Good.
3349151	3350212	All right, then let's talk about... What?
3350232	3351093	No Jazz Jackrabbit?
3351473	3351754	All right.
3352987	3357310	Let's talk about Japan and what you can look forward to over there.
3370219	3390094	PlayStation 3 nada coming out this week you gotta wait till the 15th for anything coming out over there Fallout 3 makes its debut on the 15th you have that to look forward to on the PlayStation 2 nothing on the DS nothing till the 15th and it's probably the same story on the PSP as well
3390734	3391594	So that's really it.
3391775	3395837	Unless you want some price reductions, there is a Mobile Suit Gundam game on the PSP.
3396217	3400139	Giren no Yabu, Axis no Kayui gets a price reduction.
3400439	3400799	That's it.
3401479	3403940	So it's the week of sales in Japan.
3404020	3405501	Otherwise, no new stuff until the 15th.
3407022	3409323	Well then how about just a little something else?
3410063	3410524	How about it?
3411804	3412164	Stuff.
3412585	3413185	And nonsense.
3413745	3414706	And download content!
3417707	3418307	Horse armor?
3418768	3419328	What the hell?
3421294	3422795	You know, like Oblivion had the horse armor?
3423435	3425356	Forget it.
3426157	3426497	Forget it.
3426657	3426937	Anyway.
3428958	3436362	For the fans of Guitar Hero World Tour, there is a downloadable content dated.
3436482	3442185	It actually will be coming out January 2009 at some point eventually.
3442705	3444846	So let's go ahead and go by the date.
3445367	3448868	So there will be... Actually, this should already...
3451155	3457300	BeOut is Use Me by Hinder, Because of You by Nickelback, and Light It Up by Rev Theory.
3458301	3469409	On the 8th, there is a Country Rock Track Pack, which is Me and My Gang by Rascal Flatts, Tix by Brad Paisley, and Hillbilly Deluxe by Brooks and Dunn.
3471030	3498663	um there's also um on January 15th there will be three songs by Travis Barker um the 22nd of January there will be um Tomorrow by Silverchair, Dimension by Wolfmother, and Out of the Way by The Vines and then on the 29th we have um uh Oasis um with the full uh Dig Out Your Soul album and um yeah
3500470	3509654	The album is going to be 1,520 Microsoft points or $18.99 from the PlayStation Store.
3510434	3515317	I was going to ask if that was the first full album for Guitar Hero, but I guess it's not because they had the Metallica one.
3515357	3518378	Death Magnetic came out the full album when the CD came out, right?
3518478	3519979	Yeah, it's not the first album that they've had.
3519999	3520679	They've had a few.
3520959	3521359	Oh, okay.
3522560	3524761	Metallica is infinitely more awesome than Oasis.
3526822	3527402	Yeah, I'd say so.
3528519	3557881	so interesting um some other cool stuff that's coming out on the other music game platform Rock Band um the January lineup has been leaked out as they seem to always happen um to do of course we already knew that Roy Orbison was getting a download pack um there are going to be six tracks available there Claudette in Dreams Mean Woman Blues Oh Pretty Woman Ooby Dooby and You Got It um
3559437	3569042	Then also there will be a Lenny Kravitz pack with Are You Going My Way, Freedom Train, Let Love Rule, and Mr. Cab Driver.
3569662	3574185	And then finally two tracks from the Steve Miller band, The Joker and Space Cowboy.
3575595	3577296	I don't want Pretty Woman and I want The Joker
3601653	3602874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3623834	3624635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3638095	3639756	Super Mario World and Sonic 2
3664195	3667716	So the mom asked what virtual console is and da-da-da.
3668337	3672638	And the kid said, all you have to do is put in your credit card when you're prompted to on the shop channel.
3673358	3674119	So what does she do?
3674939	3678040	She actually tried to put three credit cards into the disc slot.
3678940	3680681	What a fucking moron.
3681903	3682924	It is both possible and rampant.
3710290	3710530	Why?
3710590	3711511	Why do people actually think that?
3711531	3715852	I mean, doesn't the screen make it pretty clear that you put in your credit card number?
3716213	3723055	There are people out there who do not touch half the buttons on their TV remotes because they think it will make the TV explode.
3723075	3728118	Maybe they need those buttons.
3728598	3730959	Do not push else explosion.
3731199	3735821	I am teaching certain family members to use the digital cable guide as we speak.
3738472	3739053	Wait a minute, though.
3739093	3741234	I will say Comcast's system is pretty screwy.
3741274	3744156	That does take a class or two to learn how to use.
3744196	3746558	I think you need a college degree to be able to navigate that.
3746578	3747679	It takes about 15 minutes.
3747739	3748960	It's not TiVo, Drew.
3749820	3750781	I've never used TiVo.
3751502	3753023	It's happy face and frown face.
3753083	3755725	No, thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to rate things.
3756025	3758807	I mean, a four-year-old could figure it out, I hope.
3760068	3760908	But Comcast?
3761048	3761589	Kind of crappy.
3766329	3777896	Kazam in chat, the name I can't pronounce tonight, says, once my friend was at work, this woman came in and was buying a PlayStation 3 game, and she was asking him will it work on her VCR.
3781398	3782599	Well, ma'am, do you have a beta?
3785648	3800237	So I don't know, apparently this is what it looks like if you actually put your credit card in the Wii, is that then suddenly your system will have a lot of lines going through it and it's unable to read a disc because there's no actual disc in the system, just a jammed credit card.
3801338	3801758	Congrats.
3802199	3802679	Oh, God.
3804181	3806946	I don't know, I kind of call bullshit, but it's a funny story nonetheless.
3806986	3810012	And you know somewhere someone's tried to do it.
3810413	3815302	But what's happened here is that somebody's actually recorded it.
3816103	3816384	Anyhow...
3817512	3821513	Let's talk about something a lot more relevant and something the smart people do.
3821973	3829115	And what smart people do is that they go and they try to explore their gaming's history and play some obscure video games they may not have before.
3829515	3832755	And DarkSakura, well, heck, she's one of the smartest and she's here to pick.
3832815	3834456	She's the most smartest, in fact.
3834876	3839717	And she's here to pick a video game for you to play this week in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
3844306	3845708	So, what should the kids play this week?
3845908	3849331	The classic game of the week was suggested to me by Sauce.
3850072	3852815	I see, so this is a saucy way to kick in 2009.
3855297	3856619	Captain America and the Avengers.
3857760	3858300	Yay.
3859662	3861544	This game is classic.
3862685	3867610	Side-scrolling, beat-em-up action with cheeseball voice acting.
3869501	3873863	and wonderful background music.
3874464	3877065	Let's just have some of this background music.
3878145	3878906	Can we, Rob?
3881947	3884169	Well, maybe after the story part.
3895570	3903477	Anyway, you get to play as one of four of the Avengers, either Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, or Vision.
3903797	3906880	Which, why Vision is all white and not green and red?
3907020	3909762	Like, Christmas is beyond me.
3910403	3912865	It could just be graphical limitations at the time.
3914146	3918950	But you can actually either play a four-player cabinet or a two-player cabinet.
3919351	3921973	You just have to change it on the board itself.
3922293	3922874	That's pretty cool.
3923314	3927016	and you get sound effects like in old comic books.
3927496	3928437	You get black.
3929557	3930218	Wham.
3931338	3932559	Or 60s Batman.
3933259	3934380	Yeah, or 60s Batman.
3934800	3936221	I grew up on this freaking game.
3936261	3939083	I remember playing it at Pizza Hut when I was six.
3939863	3940523	No, it's great.
3940703	3945306	It was the reason I went out to eat Pizza Hut because the pizza certainly sucked.
3946427	3948568	I went there to play Captain America and the freaking event.
3948708	3951329	Oh no, don't go to Pizza Hut and expect to get pizza.
3952170	3952490	Oh no.
3954990	3969722	Um, anyway, um, you, uh, you actually fight, um, different, you know, your bosses, which will be Claw, the Living Laser, Rowland, the Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin, I'm sorry, I still laugh at that.
3970643	3973586	Um, Juggernaut, Ultron, Crossbones, and Red Skull.
3974847	3979390	And you also get cameos by other Avengers, which, um,
3980091	3981512	Was Namor ever an Avenger?
3981532	3983053	Because it says he's in the game.
3983113	3985254	I don't think he ever really was one.
3988756	3993818	He was by hanging around sometimes and shouting in curious ways.
3994639	3998841	Anyway, but you had Wasp, Quicksilver, and Wonder Man.
3999401	4000722	Is Samuel L. Jackson in it?
4001442	4002643	No, this was before... Don't care.
4003723	4005544	This was before Ultimates.
4006585	4006885	I see.
4007782	4010167	This was David Hasselhoff era.
4017156	4021819	Unfortunately, while the arcade version was great, the console ports really sucked.
4047516	4050619	And you had to save Vision and Iron Man from Mandarin.
4051680	4053682	Which was kind of like playing Bionic.
4053702	4057385	It actually had this map set up like Bionic Commando.
4057405	4058626	Yeah, it was a platformer.
4059367	4060468	It kind of sucked too.
4061068	4063290	Oh yeah, because Mandarin would so be able to do that.
4065893	4066373	As if.
4066533	4066653	Yeah.
4069133	4081260	At any rate, another bit of fun trivia is that the North American version of the arcade machine, when your character dies, instead of saying continue or like that, it's like, America still needs your help.
4083261	4085302	That's the part I remember about this game.
4085782	4087583	Even I played this game when I was younger.
4087603	4088543	I wasn't six.
4088623	4089484	I was a little bit older.
4091785	4095167	But I do remember that when you would die, America still needs your help.
4097376	4098696	I can't move!
4099637	4101557	It really tries to guilt you into continuing playing.
4101637	4105739	Like, if you don't put in another quarter, you are a terrorist.
4106459	4106940	Basically.
4107260	4111221	Well, clearly that line was removed from the Asian-European versions.
4112662	4114803	Dear Data East, make more pinball.
4116504	4117624	Where's our Avengers pinball?
4119125	4119385	The end.
4120560	4123124	Alright, so there it is, your classic video game of the week.
4123965	4125887	Captain America and the Avengers.
4126548	4128190	Please note... Sounds like a bad band.
4128411	4133638	Specifically... Specifically, though, here, the arcade version.
4134179	4136842	Not the console versions, which are a little bit shit.
4138123	4138703	A little bit.
4138823	4139464	There you have it.
4139844	4140824	Your classic video game of the week.
4141084	4146826	So that's going to be a hard one for the kids to find because, you know, we would never endorse downloading ROMs and playing them on emulators.
4146926	4147406	Oh, no, no.
4147486	4149687	No, we've never used MAME in our lives.
4149727	4153048	So you're going to need to find a pizza hut near you that still has this game.
4153148	4154108	So good luck with that.
4154508	4155228	Let us know what you find.
4156649	4156969	All right.
4157089	4158989	So that's going to do it for this part A of our show.
4159049	4160970	But, hey, we still have plenty more, including...
4161795	4172428	including hello tonight we are going to play match game that's right tonight we're going to play match game and give away some prize we're going to tell them what the prize is that we're giving away tonight or do we keep it a secret or what are we doing
4173496	4176597	We will tell you right after the break.
4176617	4177458	Oh, good tease.
4177518	4177758	All right.
4178278	4180659	So we'll tell you right after the break, so stay tuned.
4180719	4186882	See, the podcast listeners, though, they're not going to have to wait at all, except then again they don't get to play either because the game will be done by the time this hits the podcast feed.
4187122	4187563	Sorry, guys.
4188143	4190284	I promise there will be a contest you can do very soon.
4191104	4192685	Anyhow, let's take a break.
4192705	4194766	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4201292	4205517	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 4th of 2009.
4206358	4209161	I'm very happy because I'm eating ice cream.
4209661	4213686	DarkSakura and Tiara Rara, or Sauce, brought ice cream tonight for us.
4214166	4217650	And it's like the slow churn kind, so it's actually not that bad as far as fat goes either.
4217710	4218991	So that made me very happy.
4219252	4220413	Thank you both for thinking of that.
4220833	4220993	Good.
4222495	4224436	DarkNight in chat says, I hope you guys get brain freezes.
4224456	4226337	But what is the fabulous prize you're going to play for tonight?
4226357	4227497	Well, tonight I have brought the prize.
4227557	4228578	It is a $25 Amazon gift certificate.
4248783	4252425	Wow, that's like a DS game right there.
4252625	4253645	All right, very nice.
4253945	4256286	So is this courtesy AvengersTower.com?
4256786	4257607	Sure, why not?
4257787	4258147	All right.
4258247	4267211	I figured you guys have given like Xbox related stuff out as prizes before and some people don't have Xboxes or some people would rather spend it on other things.
4267271	4271472	So Amazon gift certificate kind of is whatever you want.
4271612	4275314	You can spend it game related or else whatever you want to spend it on.
4276018	4277039	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4296021	4297061	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4322971	4324452	Sad but true, sad but true.
4325172	4325433	All right.
4326013	4328795	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news before we get to the fancy prizes.
4328875	4330016	Big money, big prizes.
4330476	4331757	Loki, why don't you start us off?
4332537	4333158	All right, sweet.
4333818	4334058	Well...
4336529	4338130	I think we talked about this last week.
4338170	4345611	There were some new Sega games, or I should say older Sega games, that were getting new ESRB listings.
4346351	4357714	And one of those actually, that wasn't quite part of one of the ESRB listings, but it's been re-registered by Sega for another trademark, would be Choo Choo Rocket.
4358294	4370806	Apparently on December 22nd, Sega USA has re-registered Choo Choo trademark as one of many Dreamcast titles to get remade.
4372948	4380035	Some other trademarks that have been re-registered as well, Sonic Shuffle, Cosmic Smash, Jet Grind Radio, Virtual Lawn,
4382177	4384177	and now Choo Choo Rocket.
4385098	4386138	That's interesting.
4386178	4386978	I wonder what that means.
4387118	4393959	It might actually be possibly coming out on Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and WiiWare as people seem to think.
4395639	4396000	Awesome.
4396200	4398140	I guess if you're a huge fan of Choo Choo Rocket.
4398180	4398480	I don't know.
4398520	4400700	I was never that big on Choo Choo Rocket.
4400760	4402681	Choo Choo Rocket is crack.
4402801	4406221	I'm hoping that maybe some other big games will come out thanks to this.
4407402	4407942	So we'll see.
4408922	4409222	Alright.
4410447	4411427	Sorry, I'm laughing.
4411647	4412928	If I sound like I'm laughing, it's because I am.
4413488	4416329	I really shouldn't do this, but I send private messages during the show.
4416809	4418150	I know Jamie does it too.
4418170	4420510	We're all chatting during the show.
4421131	4422711	Sometimes I send funny things.
4423311	4424112	That's why I'm laughing.
4424192	4426052	Loki, do you talk to anyone else while the show's going on?
4426753	4426913	No.
4428713	4431134	I was talking to Drew, but now I'm done.
4431474	4432234	You were talking to Drew?
4432254	4436636	Yeah, I was IMing him with my phone, but now I signed out because it's too hard to text IM.
4437574	4440575	You guys are sitting literally mere feet away from each other.
4440615	4441795	You could write on a paper.
4442136	4447097	We did this the other night because I said something to her on Twitter.
4448198	4451219	And then I was like, wait, she's right behind me.
4452339	4457961	Or, and I guess I'll say this now, I was going to kind of leave it a secret until we come back from vacation and I actually have it hung up.
4458361	4462242	However, the studio got a new present this week thanks to...
4464219	4464799	and DarkSakura.com
4487344	4487884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4512307	4519417	Hey, QGames, I'm talking on the PlayStation blog this week about some games that are coming out in 2009.
4519477	4520979	They are pixel junk titles.
4521339	4523783	Two or three of them apparently are coming out this year.
4524223	4525205	One of them has already come out.
4525225	4527147	That was Pixel Junk Monsters for the PSP.
4527548	4529831	However, who knows what the others could be.
4530251	4536693	Although, you know, if you believe what you've seen on Spike TV lately, there was skiing, fighting, and so on.
4536773	4542895	So you can probably imagine there's going to be a pixel junk about some other type of genre you've probably already seen before.
4543956	4549437	But, of course, one of the last games we got from them was Pixel Junk Eden, which was kind of like random.
4549657	4551278	So who knows what it's going to be.
4551898	4557320	I do not play this series an awful lot, but I know it's one of the few exclusive series they've got going on right now, right, Loki?
4558767	4559287	Which one now?
4559587	4560128	PixelJunk?
4560588	4563269	Yes, it is one exclusive series that they have going on.
4563389	4564129	Have you ever played it?
4564209	4566511	I have not played these games personally, so I don't know a whole lot about it.
4566551	4569712	I thought there was another one, like a PixelJunk racer game as well.
4569732	4570652	There might, I think there is.
4570712	4570912	Yeah.
4573450	4573730	I don't know.
4573750	4574871	I haven't really touched any of them.
4574911	4584198	But remember, lately, up until about a couple weeks ago, I didn't realize that I couldn't just spend the exact amount on the PlayStation Network for things.
4584658	4587501	Although, I still don't see myself playing a lot of stuff on the PlayStation 3.
4589822	4597488	I'm a little hesitant to buy stuff like PixelJunk games just because I have so many Xbox Live Arcade games that I don't play.
4597908	4598349	You know what I mean?
4600390	4601171	Yeah, I hear you.
4602318	4604319	Alright, well, just thought I'd check.
4605500	4607301	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
4609383	4609583	Jamie.
4611503	4616487	Well, this is, I guess, a matter of debate for several people.
4617267	4624252	They're saying that collectible games are losing their value because of digital re-releases.
4625973	4635480	Especially if you go look on eBay for a lot of these titles, people are just not getting the money that they used to be able to get for them.
4637200	4651554	um for example um uh Ikaruga um was uh $75 for the Dreamcast version $45 for the GameCube version um when they both came out on Xbox Live Arcade uh the games went to $5 to $15 um
4656132	4662137	Really, I honestly, I'm not really, I don't really care that much.
4662597	4663658	This is good news for me.
4663859	4665640	You collect a lot of video games.
4665660	4667442	You have some obscure fucking shit in your house.
4667502	4670064	So if anybody's going to be pissed off, I'd imagine you'd be.
4671443	4672905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4691425	4691845	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4708137	4719602	I don't really care so much about them being re-released because the whole reason... Now, I was kind of giddy for a little while about my version about having Dracula X when, ooh, $300, I got it for $100, ooh.
4720743	4726665	And then I was like, but really, the whole reason I wanted the game was to play it because it's a fun game.
4727506	4735389	And if it's being re-released, that means that, you know, more people can actually get a chance to play the fun shit that I have.
4735669	4736950	Like Suikoden this week.
4737230	4737911	Or Castlevania Chronicles.
4737931	4739772	I don't really give a crap about Suikoden.
4739912	4740153	Sorry.
4740173	4740873	Castlevania Chronicles?
4741434	4741694	Yeah.
4742154	4742454	Okay.
4743335	4746798	But I mean, it's a game.
4747839	4750601	Why shouldn't they re-release it, especially if they know people love it?
4751582	4753823	Why shouldn't they try to make money off of old franchises?
4753863	4754484	Seriously.
4756205	4757266	I have no problem with it.
4757486	4759768	Even though, ooh, you're not special anymore.
4759788	4760429	Ooh.
4760649	4760789	Ooh.
4762608	4763028	www.DarkSakura.com
4779255	4785000	You can fit every Atari 2600 cartridge ever made onto one CD, probably.
4785561	4792487	But it's still kind of cool when you actually see an Atari 2600 system and you actually see the cartridge for Sword Quest.
4792527	4794289	It's kind of like, oh cool, I remember this game.
4794369	4797932	We hook up our nests and blow in the thing all the time just to, you know...
4799338	4800139	It's the same thing.
4801401	4806989	Rob, you could probably fit every single Atari 2600 cartridge onto one PlayStation 2 memory card.
4807450	4808571	Probably, I wouldn't doubt it.
4808672	4810094	It's six megs for all the ROMs.
4810614	4811556	Don't ask me how I know that.
4813258	4813839	How do you know?
4813959	4814320	Never mind.
4815146	4819250	Well, at any rate, it's a difference in experience.
4819290	4823154	You can play the game, or you could go back on the system.
4823474	4832182	That's why I had a big problem with emulation for a little while, and it wasn't that I had a problem with people ripping games and emulating them and this, that, and the other.
4832603	4839710	It's the fact that I really wanted to have the original game so that I could play it on my system and play the game the way...
4840430	4842431	Other people played the game, you know what I mean?
4842991	4843191	Right.
4843671	4849993	And so that's where I think the special part of it is, you know, is having it and playing it.
4850033	4853253	But seriously, if other people get to enjoy the game, I have no problem with it.
4853594	4859235	If it makes it cheaper for me to get those games that I want, by all means, you know.
4859395	4860175	Let's release more.
4860515	4864316	Now tell me, though, how many people have a Turbo Duo?
4865377	4865537	Hmm.
4867865	4868726	That still works.
4868786	4869106	You do.
4869606	4870047	I know.
4870827	4871588	And I love it.
4872508	4873209	But you know what?
4873549	4876311	If anyone wanted to play my Turbo Duo, I would bring it over.
4877992	4882975	As long as their house wasn't, you know, covered in dust that went up to my knees.
4883715	4884196	Very nice.
4886237	4887538	Your house is not that dusty.
4888719	4889119	My house?
4889659	4891180	No, Andrew's over there making faces at me.
4891821	4892221	I don't know.
4894056	4895417	My car is very dusty.
4895517	4896997	It's probably dustier than your house.
4897017	4901439	My PlayStation 3 is really dusty except in the area where the eject button and the power button is.
4901919	4902939	It's like a dust magnet.
4903039	4903980	It's very interesting.
4904120	4905900	If I didn't dust ours, it'd be like that.
4906241	4907001	Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
4909030	4919558	Actdeft says, Collectors, swap meets are your friends.
4919678	4921559	I speak for my friends' experience, and my own.
4922600	4925983	I don't know, have you had a lot of luck at swap meets, DarkSakra, in your collecting?
4926463	4927063	Every so often.
4927464	4927664	Yeah?
4928484	4928845	Very cool.
4929465	4929665	Hmm.
4930226	4930426	Well...
4931672	4938836	I know when Mega Man 9 came out earlier this year, it was pretty much the retro gamers kind of dream game.
4939537	4943540	Especially a perfect release for the Mega Man series.
4943920	4947142	Kind of going back to the roots of the earlier Mega Man games.
4947682	4949584	Well, it almost wasn't the case.
4950584	4953706	Actually, 1UP did an interview with the producer of Mega Man 9.
4954687	4958810	And said they had heard a bunch of... They were...
4960216	4970981	The management of Capcom was actually talking about doing a 3D Mega Man game for Mega Man 9 instead, which is interesting.
4972441	4974882	They had heard lots of negative responses.
4974922	4983286	They thought that it would be better to make it 3D and that the 8-bit style would only appeal to Mega Man fans, which would limit the sales potential.
4984701	4987202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5014656	5014816	Mega Man 10
5042907	5043227	Someday.
5044528	5045069	Someday.
5045309	5046610	I think Mega Man 9 did really well.
5047170	5049932	Or will they just call it Mega Man X and then really confuse us?
5050012	5053014	Because, you know, there's Mega Man 10 and now Mega Man X. It's too confusing.
5053694	5054355	How about Mega Man 9 2?
5055616	5057877	What happens when they get to Mega Man X 10?
5060139	5060619	Too crazy.
5061139	5063801	Mega Man Triple X. Oh yeah.
5064262	5064742	Oh yeah.
5064802	5066003	Isn't that already fan fiction?
5066023	5067043	The love robots.
5069005	5071027	You have to kill Cockman and Boob Woman.
5075431	5077372	I can hear the show going down the toilet.
5077392	5082557	It must be that time for... Stupid Award!
5084673	5087214	Mirror Mirror on the wall, who's the stupidest of them all?
5087274	5093255	Well this week, it is a 17 year old, and so therefore we don't know their name because it's some dumb kid.
5094176	5100857	And this 17 year old lives in Ohio, and what he did this week, he threatened to commit suicide on an internet video game.
5100957	5101457	What game?
5102098	5103278	World of Warcraft.
5103905	5113550	That's right, he paged a GM in World of Warcraft and told the GM that he was suicidal, that the game is the only thing that he has to live for.
5113570	5118412	And you might think, gee, Rob, that's pretty harsh of you to give somebody who's suicidal a stupid award.
5118832	5120413	Well, here's the whole thing.
5120933	5121633	It was a joke.
5122374	5127776	The kid did it as a joke, quote, to try and get what he wanted for the game.
5129577	5130358	So in other words...
5131305	5131965	Thanks for watching!
5150632	5152494	The questions being asked, where in Ohio?
5152534	5154396	I think they're like, oh God, is this in my town?
5155357	5159381	It was in Middletown, because it's being from the Middletown Journal.
5159441	5160322	Oh no, it's Fairfield.
5161603	5162785	Fairfield Township.
5162985	5163986	What are you talking about?
5165888	5166268	What do you mean?
5166288	5169470	There are no sympathetic employees.
5170170	5173672	Actually, the one GM I talked to one time was really nice.
5173772	5176533	They said, you know, my character's name is kind of funny.
5176573	5178514	I don't want to repeat it, but I have a funny character name.
5178534	5180635	They're like, salutations, and said my name.
5181016	5183557	And they even gave me a less than three, a little heart.
5184017	5185458	It's a standardized greeting.
5186939	5187279	Whatever.
5189900	5190821	You're a standardized greeting.
5190841	5191881	I talk to a lot of them.
5192361	5192682	Why?
5192802	5195483	Are you like a tattletale or something?
5196232	5196573	Oh, God.
5196714	5198138	Oh, God.
5198158	5199722	I see.
5205219	5210140	All right, well, anyway, by the way, just so you guys know, the kid was handcuffed and placed in a patrol car.
5211000	5213881	The boy was... Which Jamie is applauding.
5214401	5220022	The boy was then released to his father a little later, hopefully for some big spankings, even though he's 17.
5222843	5225043	Somehow I don't think that would stop Jamie if it was her kid.
5225824	5226044	No.
5226504	5229885	If you were 17, if your 17-year-old did this, would you spank them?
5230065	5230265	Yes.
5232959	5238283	By the way, the kid is going to appear in court on Tuesday the 6th, Butler County Juvenile Court.
5241685	5244828	Wow, it tells you practically where this kid lives in the story.
5244848	5245548	That's not good.
5246289	5247449	You can probably figure out who it is.
5247509	5248150	I'm not going to say it.
5248190	5248970	That's too much.
5250271	5250952	It's Billy!
5253113	5256716	Wow, it's a first-degree misdemeanor, by the way, for that whole thing.
5256996	5261779	But, you know, as a Blizzard employee, props to them for taking all the claims seriously.
5261800	5262300	Because, you know...
5262780	5289136	you never know you know if you've ever dealt with suicidal people suicidal people they just want to talk to anyone that will listen and I could totally see that I bet Blizzard gets some of these that are legit and like really sad and all that so it kind of sucks that there's this one asshole kid who has to take the whole thing as a joke it's also in their best interest to keep their clients alive so that they can pay their monthly fees besides just that Loki I just want to say businesses like that or companies like that do take things like that seriously um
5290006	5290626	Thanks for watching!
5308651	5312034	He denied everything because she called the police because she was worried about him.
5312074	5313496	She had all the text messages.
5313556	5317559	They had phone records from all the calls and everything.
5317619	5319461	And he got dragged off to the funny farm.
5319481	5321222	And that could have happened to that kid.
5321242	5328208	They could have said, well, if he's going to commit suicide, let's call the police and have them take him to a mental institution for an evaluation.
5328869	5330831	And I'm not sure if that's better or worse than jail.
5330911	5334334	But long story short, don't be stupid and do things like that.
5335339	5335719	That's right.
5336239	5342562	You know, a 17-year-old should have had The Boy Who Cried Wolf read to him when he was, you know, five or younger.
5343442	5343742	Anyhow.
5345743	5346203	There you go.
5346443	5349344	That sounds like a quest that should be in World of Warcraft.
5350125	5353226	They like parodying, you know, old fairy tales.
5354975	5356437	They do like to parody a lot of stuff.
5356757	5359721	They have a parody of PETA in the game, which I thought was really funny.
5360181	5366069	Like, if you get the blood of animals on you and then you try to run through this little encampment, they'll all try to kill you and call you names.
5366730	5367551	So it's kind of funny.
5368512	5368812	Anyhow.
5369493	5371996	I would think that they would want to throw blood on you, you know.
5373097	5373637	DarkSakura
5396232	5398599	Well, we've only got three emails.
5399482	5403834	So the first one is from Cheeseburger.
5405225	5406266	Hi, OLR.
5406346	5414171	About a year ago, while I was doing my math homework, I was listening to your wonderful show when my math book pushed the PSP off the table and broke the screen.
5414912	5420115	I called Sony, and even when it was still under extended warranty, they wanted $90 to fix it.
5420395	5424398	Well, I thought, screw that, Sony, and my PSP gathered dust for over a year.
5424558	5426960	Then I discovered the magic of eBay and got a new screen.
5427680	5429781	It's like buying a new PSP all over again.
5430342	5434965	So my question to you guys, and girls, is what games or UMD movies do you recommend?
5436326	5442531	I don't like sports games, but I do like RPGs, MMOs, FPSs, anything else that uses an acronym.
5442671	5443091	I'm sorry.
5443572	5444012	That was me.
5445413	5446854	Anything you guys like, pretty much.
5447335	5450437	I also have a few movies in one game, Medal of Honor Heroes.
5450998	5452859	Oh, and it's a PSP FAT.
5453440	5457083	Also, my DS has been gathering dust for longer than that, and it's working fine.
5457523	5458964	Any games worth checking out on that?
5460045	5461786	Um... Yeah.
5462207	5464529	Um, for PSP, um...
5465635	5467057	Final Fantasy 1 and 2 for sure.
5467077	5469580	If you like RPGs, those are pretty awesome remakes.
5471062	5475688	There's also the Metal Gear games that came out on that.
5475808	5479473	The interesting little card games that they were.
5479770	5482351	Catapult is kind of fun if you like little music games like that.
5482591	5483592	Every Extend Extra?
5484272	5485172	Yeah, the Q games are fun.
5485192	5486273	Oh, check out your copy again.
5486453	5487433	Thank God, bring it back.
5488273	5495816	And I like Space Invaders Extreme was fun too, but I like those like music-y type games.
5496337	5499298	As far as UMDs, if you can freaking find any, good luck.
5499518	5502879	You know, whatever movies you like, dude, don't let me tell you what movies you like.
5502899	5504760	Yeah, they're kind of hard to find, so good luck with that.
5505576	5509278	As far as DS goes, definitely in Castlevania, Order of Ecclesia.
5511599	5512360	Cooking Mama 2.
5512420	5515801	Yeah, Dracula X Chronicles.
5515881	5516922	That's for PSP.
5517742	5518243	Final Fantasy 4.
5518283	5520364	If I'm going to be a Final Fantasy whore, why not?
5521624	5526107	Chrono Trigger is out on DS.
5527387	5528888	Animal Crossing, there's that.
5529208	5532550	Chatroom is recommending DJ Max if you're a music fan for PSP.
5534252	5535035	So there you go.
5535135	5537462	Just look online.
5538565	5539047	Good times.
5540023	5540664	Next email?
5541244	5541464	Yes.
5542545	5544467	Dear OLR, first of all, Happy New Year.
5544987	5548490	Here's to the year not resembling the intake valve of a commercial air compressor.
5549611	5553354	By that, I mean I hope it does not suck nor seem designed to do just that.
5554335	5557838	Second, to all the Doctor Who fans in the OLR army, here's an article of interest.
5558378	5562401	New Doctor is the youngest ever, and yes, I have seen this.
5564923	5566725	The new Doctor is Tom Green.
5568240	5569721	Tom Green is the new Doctor
5587157	5593281	Um, and, uh, they've, if I'm right, they've actually already started filming for the 2009 series.
5594141	5597343	Um, but, oh well, I don't know too much about him.
5597403	5605168	If, if any of our, uh, listeners overseas know more about this guy, um, send me some of his stuff so I can see what it is.
5606248	5612652	Um, but yeah, um, it says, uh, thank you for your time, Hunter Red, Redertainment.
5613072	5615113	This message is brought to you by Zap Attack.
5615253	5616194	Insert cheat plug here.
5618080	5620564	There is some Dr. Eleven hate going on in chat.
5620884	5623769	Brad from PodCulture says the casting for Dr. Eleven sucks.
5625131	5626173	I am saying this.
5627596	5629439	As much of a 10 fan girl I am,
5631465	5633807	I think I'm going to give the guy a chance.
5634668	5639733	The only doctor who was ever an awful doctor was the sixth doctor.
5641074	5642155	He was scary.
5643416	5649842	To me, my favorite doctor to date is still the fourth doctor, as much as I love ten.
5650342	5653645	But I also sort of see that dividing line between series.
5655067	5656168	We won't even talk about the movie.
5657867	5660328	So in other words, we need to give the guy a chance?
5660568	5661108	Give him a chance.
5661208	5663929	Just give him one episode to make it good?
5663989	5664849	Give him the season.
5665310	5665610	Alright.
5665790	5667030	Give the guy a chance.
5667230	5670131	You don't know until you see them in.
5671652	5677754	All we are saying, give Matt Smith a chance.
5678968	5685874	Well, it's just my point is you really aren't going to know until you watch it with an open mind.
5685974	5691859	If you watch it expecting him to suck, if you watch it looking for all the faults, you're going to see them.
5691919	5698625	You're not going to enjoy yourself because you're going to be too busy sucking your... He's not David Tennant!
5699306	5700126	And I whined.
5700306	5700887	I did whine.
5701307	5702368	My first day I whined.
5703389	5706612	But my opinion is sit back and watch.
5708203	5712207	You have to watch anyways because at some point soon Patrick Stewart will be guest starring.
5713188	5716531	So that's definitely worthwhile.
5716571	5720315	I think that's probably during one of the filler specials next year.
5721923	5723364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5746776	5749139	Drew Nami is suggesting Loki as the 13th Doctor.
5749419	5751621	I don't think that will work because he's not very British.
5751641	5752542	I'm not a Doctor Who fan.
5752982	5753843	He's not very British.
5756146	5761091	From what I'm understanding, the episode with Patrick Stewart on it is actually going to be an actual episode.
5761831	5764074	But it's during David Tennant's run still.
5764414	5766696	They should just do Simon Pegg as the next Doctor.
5766896	5769359	Simon Pegg has already been in an episode of Doctor Who.
5769946	5771087	But not as the Doctor.
5771287	5785954	No, but he's been in an episode, and they're... I would love Simon Pegg as the Doctor, but they are very... They're very continuity conscious.
5786451	5790473	I like the idea of Doctor Who being a woman, or it was Catherine Zeta-Jones.
5790953	5792594	Come on, I mean, she sold T-Mobile.
5792814	5793475	She could sell a TARDIS.
5793495	5801099	You know what I wish, and sorry, spoilers, who cares, if Donna took over as the Doctor.
5801499	5803460	John Cleese is the next Doctor.
5804961	5814446	You know, now I need to see Doctor Who in The Curse of the Fatal Death, which was Rowan Atkinson playing the Doctor.
5815296	5818217	No, I need to, you know who they should cast as the Doctor?
5818337	5818977	Benny Hill.
5821318	5823839	Isn't he dead?
5825080	5825700	Exhume him.
5827821	5828641	Is Benny Hill dead?
5828701	5829161	Probably.
5830282	5832963	Bono is the next Doctor Who.
5833283	5835324	Now you've got me all curious if Benny Hill is dead or not.
5835404	5836784	Alright, he is?
5836944	5838605	Alright, he died some time ago, I think.
5838705	5839826	Let's take our word for it.
5840266	5843167	Alright, well, make it like a weekend at Bernie's thing.
5844912	5845732	Alright, let's move on.
5845752	5846833	This show's getting depressing.
5848173	5851414	So, moving on to the last email.
5851634	5852474	Christ, he died in 1992.
5852534	5858096	Where is Horson's Radio bringing you the late breaking news?
5859256	5860677	Benny Hill just died.
5861057	5862577	Today is a tragic day.
5866439	5866699	Rob.
5867199	5867679	What?
5868059	5868899	You make me weep.
5870400	5870960	In my heart.
5872779	5874700	Well, I mean, I hadn't seen the guy in a while.
5874760	5877101	I kind of figured he was probably old and dead.
5877141	5878301	I mean, forget it.
5878541	5880902	Okay, there's people I haven't seen in a while.
5881282	5882623	Maybe they're old and dead.
5885043	5886144	Okay?
5886164	5889165	When was the last time you saw Molly Ringwald on TV?
5889185	5891466	I haven't seen my mother in a while.
5891486	5893106	Actually, I saw her on TV the other day.
5893326	5894387	So she's not old and dead.
5894407	5898688	My wife watches a lot of ABC Family and Lifetime.
5898828	5900349	Okay, what about Ally Sheedy?
5901476	5902277	Who's Ally Sheedy?
5903097	5904459	I haven't seen my mother in a week.
5904799	5905700	I hope she's okay.
5906801	5907962	Didn't you see the Breakfast Club?
5909062	5910283	Oh, I don't know any of their names.
5910303	5911264	She was the crazy girl.
5912525	5913947	Okay, but I don't know any of their names.
5913967	5915588	They're just people in the Breakfast Club.
5916789	5921273	VidPower in chat says, Rise from your grave, Benny Hill.
5924275	5926017	Raul Julia is the next Benny Hill.
5927930	5928731	Tim Curry's still alive.
5928751	5929591	Tim Curry's still doing stuff.
5929791	5930292	He did spam a lot.
5930312	5930852	He will never die.
5930892	5931933	He's not old and dead yet.
5931993	5932513	He's just old.
5933534	5933914	And gay.
5935215	5935615	And fat.
5936676	5937656	Next email.
5937696	5937897	Yes.
5938337	5938837	Hey, guys.
5938937	5940458	I have a question for Loki.
5940999	5941799	Hey, Loki.
5942340	5943840	This is Alpha Cananogram.
5944241	5945041	Just curious.
5945522	5950245	Right now, I'm opening my PSP 2001 Slim and Light, comma, comma, comma.
5950945	5979143	and I have stripped slash have almost stripped the head of one of the top two screws so now I can't try to fix my d-pad any suggestions on how to remove the screw or how to fix my d-pad it kept going either left or right and sometimes up or down sometimes if I barely touch right it'll go left this is the first period he's used in the sorry the second period he's using the entire email sorry y'all for the grammar really in the bad situation at the moment that's no excuse keep on going alpha canonogram
5979383	5979943	Thanks for watching!
6004173	6005755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6021074	6049919	although you should be able to buy I think they actually sell some of the replacement screws online you can buy a kit of like all sorts of miscellaneous parts for the PSP so just buy that I replaced a shoulder button for one of my PSPs I think one time with a kit similar to that so that'd be the best way to go oh and none of those face plates the clear ones ever seem to fit properly which sucks because I remember trying to put some of those on too
6051906	6056349	TheRobD in chat is trying to say that since I haven't been on TV in a while, I'm old and dead.
6056929	6058190	And I'm young and fabulous.
6058330	6059431	Tell him that he's wrong.
6060532	6061432	WRONG!
6062813	6067496	And then Ranma's trying to piggyback on top of that saying, of course, Sky would have the rainbow-colored coffin.
6068016	6069718	And I'm thinking, they have those?
6071499	6074341	If there is such a thing, Elton John's got one reserved.
6074561	6074861	Really?
6076962	6079004	Look, all I ask... This is a platform coffin.
6080384	6081065	All I ask...
6083627	6086129	All I ask is to be buried with my ABBA albums.
6086169	6087210	That's all I ask.
6091093	6091493	Anyhow.
6092254	6096737	You mean the one ABBA album that you have that lives at my house that we haven't given you yet?
6097998	6099499	Actual album, yeah.
6099519	6100660	Bring it over.
6100980	6102401	I want it.
6102421	6103262	Give me my ABBA.
6103842	6104703	It's Super Trooper.
6105223	6106945	Super Trooper.
6107225	6108206	Any more emails?
6111969	6112309	No!
6112550	6117453	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.
6118234	6127101	But, I think we're to that part of the show where maybe, just maybe, it's about time that we give something away.
6128662	6132125	And we do the match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6132205	6132766	Woohoo!
6143419	6144101	I skipped ahead.
6144181	6144803	False alarm.
6144843	6146948	We'll get to the match game in just a little bit.
6148612	6149314	Live radio.
6149354	6150517	Wasn't that an ultimate tease?
6153619	6177065	i'm like no we're not i might want to edit that later if i remember we'll see let's we'll pretend it didn't happen we'll just pretend that didn't happen let's move on with some more gaming stories all right um well speaking of how the playstation 3 you know was uber awesome in internet browsing well the playstation 3 has been used to um break the internet as well in fact
6177505	6189975	A cluster of PlayStation 3s, 200 to be exact, linked together were able to do the math to help decrypt the MD5 hash used in Verisign.
6190015	6200284	So yes, if you have 200 PS3s lying around linked together, you too can crack supposedly uncrackable encryption.
6201384	6201925	Hurrah.
6204212	6214117	So they're not really worried though that anybody's going to crack this other than obviously this research team because really who's sitting on 200 PS3s other than Sony?
6217938	6218218	Nobody.
6218839	6219219	Nobody.
6220459	6222120	There's all those other research labs, remember?
6224041	6227323	The ones that are actually trying to cure cancer.
6227343	6228803	Yeah, my PS3 cures cancer.
6229544	6230004	It's awesome.
6231055	6236278	Well, hey, I can't buy PS3 games at airports yet, but now you can buy... Well, I guess I might.
6236598	6238179	Depending on the airport, I actually probably could.
6238519	6244362	But now you can buy a Nintendo DS and DS games in airports out of a vending machine.
6244862	6246583	Yeah, these vending machines are pretty high-end.
6246883	6252045	But, you know, I guess we've seen these types of vending machines before that have kind of the really uber-expensive stuff.
6252065	6253126	Like, I know they're in Vegas.
6253166	6253966	You see them, right?
6254006	6255087	Don't you see these things in Vegas?
6255207	6256768	Casinos and stuff with, like, iPods and...
6257168	6257568	All that stuff.
6257868	6264232	Well, now they have these fancy vending machines with expensive DS games and Nintendo DSs in them.
6266710	6272113	Apparently, it's something that Best Buy is doing, and it's a Best Buy Express vending machine.
6272633	6275955	These things are at a couple of the different airports throughout the U.S.
6276575	6282999	Not only, though, should I point out that they sell the DS and DS games, they sell headphones, chargers, and so on.
6283399	6289002	Now, I want to point out, though, that if you've ever flown before, you'll know you actually don't want to use the DS, though, during landing and takeoff.
6289042	6289402	It's bad.
6290697	6291637	And you could crash the plane.
6291878	6294499	No, not really, but they'd get really angry at you when you do that.
6294559	6296420	So only use it when it's safe.
6296580	6299961	It's kind of neat that they have these sort of kiosks.
6300101	6301862	We did see one for Sony and stuff.
6302623	6308505	Unfortunately, there's also a chain of stores called... Oh gosh, now I can't remember what the name is.
6308525	6309466	Airtunes, right?
6309866	6311106	Not Airtunes, but it's...
6313058	6313738	I don't remember their call.
6313758	6319660	Anyways, but they have a chain that's in every single airport that's out there right now, and they also sell the exact same stuff.
6320380	6329363	And in case you're worried about putting in your credit card and spending hundreds of dollars on DS systems and stuff like that, and possibly getting stuck in this...
6331184	6331845	Vending Machine.
6331865	6332765	That's what I was going to say.
6332805	6336027	What happens if the little thing turns and it doesn't fall out?
6336348	6339870	Can you imagine me sitting there shaking this vending machine with $100 worth of merchandise?
6339910	6341831	I'm sure there's alarms on it and all.
6342071	6348616	But you can actually go to the store and purchase these games face-to-face with people.
6348716	6353519	So I don't really see the point of why they have this in there other than another place you can buy the same shit.
6353899	6354439	Impulse Buy.
6355220	6356301	Mommy, I want one.
6356381	6357221	Gimme, gimme, gimme.
6358022	6358202	Yeah.
6358891	6360892	Leo Shen calls it a super plane crasher DS.
6361832	6367354	BlackWolf says, now, do the DS's come already charged or do you have to charge it in the airport before you get on the plane?
6367915	6370936	And Ranma says his did come charged already.
6371436	6373077	Don't the DS's come charged?
6373837	6378379	From what I remember, my original DS and I think my DS Lite, I think I had to charge both of those.
6378459	6378759	Did you?
6380740	6381640	Sucks for them.
6382677	6385420	Yeah, because then how do you charge them before you get on the plane?
6386040	6389683	Of course, then, you know, airports, it's really easy to charge a laptop at an airport.
6389724	6390865	There's plugs everywhere.
6390885	6392746	Yeah, but you may not have the convenience or time to do that.
6392826	6398432	And better yet, I mean, really, do you really want to buy electronics at an airport?
6398492	6405098	I mean, I can understand a game, you know, I bought headphones because my headphones sucked because I had these stupid earbuds and I wanted something different, but...
6406667	6407047	Really?
6407307	6408428	A DS system?
6408468	6411889	You're like, hey, you know, I really wish I had DS.
6412129	6414209	I think this is more for like gifts and stuff like that.
6414269	6422112	Like, crap, I gotta get my son a gift and I am stupid and didn't think about getting him anything.
6422232	6423733	Oh, hey, look, a vending machine.
6423793	6425093	Let me buy some useless crap.
6428294	6432236	Yeah, problem is they don't sell porn in the airport, and that's very sad.
6432256	6434657	Well, because, you know, you shouldn't be looking at porn on a plane.
6434857	6437738	That's not going to crash a plane that does not interfere with their taking off or landing.
6437758	6439418	Yeah, but there might be children sitting behind you.
6439879	6440499	Screw the children.
6441860	6442360	No thank you.
6442901	6446103	Unless you're sitting in the very back row by yourself, then you can look at all the porn you want.
6446303	6447003	Wait, wait, wait.
6447203	6450385	If they sell a PSP, you can look at porn on the PSP.
6450845	6452726	Because we all know the PSP is the gateway to porn.
6452907	6456649	But you can't look at the internet while you're on a fucking airplane.
6458090	6458230	Ah!
6458750	6462172	But you can put pictures and encode videos onto your memory.
6462312	6463413	All at the airport?
6464513	6465614	Yes, all at the airport.
6466214	6466955	Seriously.
6469048	6476374	If you're going to go to that extreme lengths of trouble just to look at porn, why don't you just bring a Playboy on the goddamn plane?
6476394	6479897	You know what else you could do, too, is use one of those TV devices that they had.
6479997	6482879	Remember those wonderful TV devices that they don't sell anymore?
6483259	6487543	They act like a projector and project it onto the ceiling of the cabin.
6488403	6489244	You have issues.
6490845	6491166	All right.
6493367	6494788	Anyhow, let's move on.
6494828	6498011	We have one more story before we get to match game tonight.
6499150	6501251	Well, I like Legos.
6502651	6503851	And I like Rock Band.
6504972	6509013	And there's a rumor going around that those are two great tastes that taste great together.
6511313	6513114	Tastes great, less filling.
6513534	6520036	Tastes great, less... So yeah, the rumor is that there is going to be a Lego Rock Band.
6521684	6523705	That's all I can say.
6523745	6526307	There's no confirmation.
6527447	6534251	There's a... Some dude's uncle works for LEGO and heard, right?
6534271	6538114	There's supposed to be a LEGO title coming out, but LEGO Rock Band?
6538194	6541836	Dude, can't they find something?
6541856	6544578	I guess it's not the dumbest rumor I've ever heard.
6544598	6548160	Wasn't there a White Stripes video made completely out of LEGOs, if I remember right?
6548959	6553441	I think that's the only thing I could think of that could possibly tie into LEGO and Rock Band.
6553461	6554302	This is bunk.
6555142	6556183	It's gotta be bullshit.
6556243	6558164	And you know why this is completely bunk?
6558324	6561526	It's because you have to understand the way they make LEGO games.
6562106	6565668	For example, it's a specific chain of events.
6566248	6566949	You have...
6567878	6571400	The toy that they make first, then you make the video game.
6572721	6577024	Just like they've had... I believe they have the LEGO Indiana Jones toys.
6577164	6578925	I know they have the LEGO Star Wars toys.
6579686	6582908	I know that they have the LEGO Racer toys and stuff like that.
6585189	6592935	So the next logical step for me, and seeing as the rumor is EA is going to be publishing it, would be LEGO Harry Potter.
6594075	6594876	Because...
6596743	6607368	They need another LEGO game and that makes perfect sense for me that they would be able to pump out two more LEGO games based around the Harry Potter movies and they already have toys to go along with it.
6607628	6617593	So Rock Band wouldn't make any sense at all because there's no reason for them to buy... Why would you even want to... I mean, you'd have to make special peripherals for it.
6618354	6620995	There's no LEGO-themed music to go along with it.
6621075	6623136	It would just be like a reskin of Rock Band.
6625666	6627031	It would be kind of crap.
6627633	6628255	Is what it would be.
6628456	6631346	It would be not kind of crap, it would be totally crap.
6633556	6636457	TigerClaw is suggesting Lego Transformers would be another logical step.
6637057	6638338	But see, they don't have a toy for that.
6638358	6641119	Remember, it's toy, then game.
6641979	6645561	It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, the game.
6645681	6651243	Like, they're not going to just all of a sudden make, you know, Lego Halo or something like that.
6651503	6653724	Unless they make Lego Halo toys first.
6654224	6659406	It's toy and game, because Lego's not going to just put their license out there unless they have something to benefit from it.
6660521	6662682	Now you know what this has started in the chat room.
6662742	6666925	Now we have Frisbee says, Lego of Persia, Bricks of Time.
6667706	6670307	GS68 says, Beatmania 2DX Legos.
6671188	6673549	GS68 says, Imagine Legos.
6675070	6677892	Drew, even though he's sitting right behind me, says Lego Crisis.
6679653	6685297	Lego International Superstar Soccer, Lego on a Prayer, Lego Sonic the Hedgehog, Little Big Legos.
6688337	6688717	Anyhow.
6690078	6692160	Now that's a good question from Kazam.
6692180	6693260	What about the Lego MMO?
6693781	6694501	That's a good question.
6695982	6697063	Orange Lego Radio?
6699204	6699765	Alright, forget it.
6699805	6700445	Cooking Legos?
6700485	6701146	Alright, forget it.
6701846	6702126	Enough.
6702967	6703287	Stop.
6704108	6704628	Knock it off.
6705529	6707670	We have something much better to look forward to.
6707750	6711473	We are now going to play the match game.
6711513	6711953	Yes, I'm sure.
6711973	6712854	We're going to play the match game.
6714192	6717474	Tonight for the match game, we have five fabulous celebrities joining us in the studio.
6718035	6721017	Say hello to the one and only... Loki!
6722177	6722658	Hello.
6723378	6728321	And to PodCulture in the... Or Brad from PodCulture.

6731524	6734826	There are Transformer toys, but not Lego Transformer toys.
6735706	6736267	Alright, whatever.
6736987	6740510	Also, say hello to Intern Drew, who is one of our other fabulous celebrity panelists tonight.
6740530	6740970	Yo, what's up?
6741650	6742471	And, uh...

6759412	6759772	All right.
6760472	6766254	And of course, also on the celebrity panel tonight, the most fabulous of them all, me.
6767134	6767454	All right.
6769181	6769521	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 X-Link
6798716	6800937	And I'm telling him to please stand by.
6801518	6814249	We'll need to explain the rules for match game while I open up the Skype line to the first person to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to play against X-Link for that $25 gift certificate.
6814269	6814929	Okay?
6815790	6816090	Alright.
6818812	6820073	Somebody explain the rules of match game.
6820113	6820334	Hurry.
6821715	6822215	DarkSakura.
6822816	6824097	We're reading a bunch of crap.
6825455	6828643	And it ends, but it ends incomplete and you gotta complete it.
6829044	6829966	With a word.
6831189	6831650	Or phrase.
6832813	6833335	Sorry, go ahead.
6835202	6839043	Like if I said, I went to the blank, you'd have to pick.
6839063	6839963	Alright.
6840883	6844624	And X-Link just told me he has no idea how to play, so this should be fun tonight.
6844884	6848005	You have to try and match what we are thinking.
6848065	6849825	Yes, you gotta match what we are thinking.
6849845	6854406	We're gonna send you something with a blank in it, and you tell me over private message what you think should be in the blank.
6855947	6856887	Oh, and good luck.
6857327	6860309	Hurry up and go to YouTube and type in Match Game 76.
6860709	6861390	There's no time.
6861430	6863051	There's no time.
6863912	6865233	We do have a caller on the Skype line.
6865273	6865693	Hi, caller.
6865713	6866113	Who's this?
6866974	6869676	Hi, this is Ranma, aka DJ Ranma.
6870116	6871297	They're going to say it's rigged.
6871637	6872598	They're going to say it's rigged.
6872618	6873418	No way.
6873438	6875079	He's just got mad skills.
6875119	6875780	He is mad.
6875820	6879242	And it's fitting he should be our first phone contestant of the year.
6879362	6881704	He has a flaming finger when it comes to dialing.
6882324	6883025	So there you go.
6883485	6883705	All right.
6883725	6885727	Now, Ranma, do you know how to play Match Game?
6889831	6891172	Ramma, do you know how to play match game?
6891972	6892872	Why, yes, I do.
6893012	6893813	Why, yes, you do.
6893913	6894293	All right.
6894693	6896234	Can you explain to X-Link how to play?
6899195	6904056	Object... Damn it, I hosted a match game one time.
6904096	6904817	I can't remember.
6904917	6906017	Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
6906500	6906900	That's right.
6907420	6909341	Fill in the blank with what you think we're going to say.
6909401	6910701	That's the best way we can explain it.
6910801	6911862	Okay.
6912402	6921665	So the winner tonight will get a $25 gift certificate to Amazon.com courtesy of Avengers Tower, your favorite giggling game girl blog.
6921685	6924086	No, I shouldn't keep saying that because then people are going to think that's really true.
6924126	6928807	But it's actually – it's irony because if you go read it, it's actually very well thought out and very well done.
6928887	6929467	It's irony.
6929507	6930188	It's a case of irony.
6931388	6939192	and the loser tonight gets their face melted off with an Xbox 360 laser gun so don't lose alright, sound good Ranma?
6939933	6951799	works for me alright the whole chat room is yelling rigged, rigged do you have anything to say to the chat room before we begin tonight?
6953039	6955861	I'm sorry, I can't help but have the fastest internet connection in the chat
6956653	6956933	DarkSakura
6978920	6980180	As you know, no, you're in the question.
6980601	6984382	DarkSakura, as you know, doesn't like to sing in front of people.
6985362	6987983	She snubs SingStar and laughs at lips.
6988903	6995885	The whole reason for this is that she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing For Your Blank.
7001647	7004487	DarkSakura is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game.
7004527	7006048	It's called Sing For Your Blank.
7007540	7009721	Everyone here in studio is trying to cook up an answer.
7010982	7013103	And just say ding when you're done so I know you have it.
7015565	7016565	DarkSakura burped.
7021328	7021908	Okay, ding.
7022088	7023329	I changed my answer at the last minute.
7023809	7024209	Ah, ding.
7024550	7024810	Ding.
7024970	7025590	And Tiara?
7026151	7026771	Alright, Tiara, ding.
7027111	7029693	I'm just waiting for our chatroom contestant to give an answer.
7030093	7031434	Ranma, do you know an answer yet?
7032054	7032554	Yes, I do.
7032794	7033034	Ding.
7033315	7034535	Alright.
7034595	7035756	I'm waiting on our chatroom contestant.
7037011	7042393	Contestant X-Link to send me something.
7044774	7045634	I just typed hurry.
7046655	7047275	Okay, there we go.
7047315	7047815	We have an answer.
7048916	7049296	All right.
7050296	7052277	Sometimes it could be the obvious answer.
7052317	7053517	Sometimes it's not obvious.
7053597	7053878	All right.
7054258	7059520	The whole reason for this is that she's waiting for an ultimate karaoke game called Sing for Your... Ranma, Sing for Your...
7060572	7061113	Alcohol.
7061353	7064556	Sing for your alcohol, says Ranma.
7065256	7072563	Our chatter, X-Link, says she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing for Your Life, says the chatter.
7072943	7073924	Sing for your life.
7074765	7076967	All right, DarkSakura, we'll start with you on this question.
7077627	7078809	Sing for your...
7081457	7082418	We already have a match.
7082578	7082918	What is it?
7082938	7083758	I was going to say booze.
7084158	7085579	Sing for your booze!
7085879	7088000	Oh my gosh, this game's super rigged tonight.
7088080	7090241	Ranma already got a point.
7090341	7091521	All right, well, let's see what happens.
7091581	7093041	Ranma, you're on the board with a point.
7093101	7093762	Congratulations.
7093802	7094602	Sing for your booze.
7094622	7095122	We have a match.
7095402	7096243	Yay, match!
7096423	7097123	Yay!
7097743	7098563	That's amazing.
7099024	7102885	I think that's the first time in the history of this game we matched on the very first answer.
7102905	7108487	Because we go through, we've gone through games and games where nobody ever matches a goddamn thing.
7109187	7110548	This is epic match game tonight.
7110628	7117571	Sauce, she made a karaoke game called Sing for Your... I think this will possibly count for a match.
7117651	7119091	I said Sing for Your Survival.
7119391	7121172	Please remove that shotgun from my head.
7122493	7124213	Sing for Your Survival.
7124273	7125154	Will we count it?
7126388	7128129	Yeah, we're going to count it as a match.
7128169	7128709	Yay.
7128789	7129769	So now it's tied up.
7129889	7131750	One for Ranma, one for X-Link.
7131790	7134271	Okay, Loki, sing for your life.
7135972	7137973	Oh, X-Link pulls ahead with two.
7138093	7139073	Sing for your life.
7139573	7140054	Two to one.
7140374	7144355	I couldn't think of anything, so that's the first thing that came up with.
7144956	7145356	All right.
7145396	7145616	Clever.
7146769	7147370	Drew Nami.
7147750	7150552	Sing for your... Guardian Legend remake.
7150792	7152534	Guardian Legend remake.
7153034	7154355	Oh, good, but not a match.
7154415	7154675	All right.
7155276	7157358	And I said, I don't think this is going to be a match.
7157398	7159479	I said, sing for your child's freedom.
7161441	7168106	Also... Well, it's... I don't know if Jamie would play it, but, like, I don't know.
7168126	7170268	It would be something I could see that they would have at Golf Land.
7170348	7171129	So there you have it.
7171189	7172330	Sing for your child's freedom.
7173050	7174011	Unfortunately, not a match.
7174852	7175512	You all right there, Jamie?
7175832	7176073	All right.
7177168	7177508	Dork.
7178188	7178989	All right, here we go.
7179049	7181670	So it's X-Link 2, Ranma 1.
7182570	7185031	All right, so Ranma, I don't know if it's rigged.
7185552	7185972	We'll see.
7187052	7187412	Oh, yeah.
7187632	7189993	All right, Ranma, it's an epic match game tonight.
7190014	7191554	There's four more chances to catch up.
7191594	7191994	Here we go.
7192455	7194756	Question number two.
7196436	7196856	Rob.
7197397	7197877	Hey, that's me.
7198837	7199437	Thank you for watching!
7221468	7221668	Ding.
7221688	7221768	Ding.
7246741	7248882	All right, everybody here in studios dinged.
7248902	7249863	Our chat room's dinged.
7250223	7251323	Ranma, do you have an answer?
7251964	7252444	Yes, I do.
7252724	7254225	All right, then we're going to get to it.
7254265	7255966	Rob is planning early for this year's E3.
7256286	7260788	I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the... Booth babes.
7261148	7264070	Booth babes, says Ranma.
7264230	7265170	All right, booth babes.
7265951	7270573	X-Link says, I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the games.
7273680	7275881	That seems like a pretty fucking obvious answer, right?
7275921	7276321	Let's see.
7276441	7276761	I don't know.
7276801	7277482	Let's see.
7279082	7283204	Did we go for the obvious or did we go for crazy?
7283284	7283644	I don't know.
7283804	7284144	Let's see.
7284725	7286565	We'll start again with DarkSakura.
7286705	7289046	I can't wait to go and see all the... Fanboy wank.
7289467	7290807	Fanboy wank.
7294549	7295849	I don't think technically that's a match.
7295889	7296309	I'm sorry.
7297230	7299511	Sauce, I can't wait to go back and see all the...
7300080	7311161	Previews for SingStar Journey Previews for SingStar Journey I don't think that's a match with games Games is too broad But that's a very good answer Very good, you know me very well
7312751	7321254	Loki, he can't wait to go back and see the... This is totally opposite of what you'd probably say anyways, but I said all the Paris Hilton games.
7321874	7323655	All the Paris Hilton games!
7324015	7324155	Ew.
7324955	7326255	Maybe in an alternate universe.
7326516	7328036	Does that match with just games, though?
7328136	7329376	I don't think it does.
7329977	7331857	Sorry, X-Links, too broad.
7334773	7339397	Drew Nami, can't wait to go back and see all the... Fucking ABBA music games.
7339577	7341818	Fucking ABBA music games.
7342399	7342839	All right.
7343220	7344501	Good answer, but not a match.
7345041	7346962	And I said, now this is going to be tricky, okay?
7347002	7347563	Here's what I said.
7347683	7354829	I said, Rob said, I can't wait to go back and see all the military men, is what I said.
7354929	7356430	But does that count for booth babes?
7356450	7359032	I think so.
7359052	7359612	You think so?
7360393	7360673	Yeah.
7360693	7361754	I think that's a good question.
7362796	7363978	That's like a booth babe for me.
7364378	7367122	Yeah, babe can go either way.
7367142	7367983	Babe can go either way.
7368103	7372609	All right, Ranma, we're going to give you a point for matching on that one, even though you got the wrong gender.
7373430	7373891	Woohoo!
7374071	7374372	All right.
7376394	7378697	Who cares about gender here on Orange Lounge Radio?
7378778	7379058	All right.
7380185	7380665	There we go.
7380766	7381706	We gave him a point for that.
7381906	7384729	Alright, so it's all tied up and the chatroom is complaining that it's rigged.
7387331	7388572	Hey, it's my gift card.
7388652	7390373	I can tell if it counts or not.
7390453	7391054	That's right.
7391394	7391915	There you go.
7392115	7392555	Oh, yeah.
7392575	7393756	Oh, snap.
7394437	7397239	Chatroom, you just got served by a giggling geek girl.
7397439	7398140	I just want to point out.
7399679	7402700	Alright, anyhow, let's get to question number three.
7403201	7404641	And you know it's a Loki question.
7404661	7405882	Alright, here we go.
7406002	7410244	Question number three in tonight's match game, epic match game here on Orange Launch Radio.
7411244	7415706	Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.
7416647	7419148	He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.
7419928	7425351	They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.
7433701	7434322	I'm gonna ding.
7434382	7436984	I'm gonna ding.
7465639	7467501	Alright, Ranma, did you ding?
7468302	7468562	Ding.
7468722	7469303	Alright, here we go.
7470083	7472506	Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.
7472546	7474247	He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.
7474287	7478751	They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of... Erotica.
7479272	7480213	Erotica.
7480933	7482475	Alright, and X-Link said...
7483601	7484762	Nude Ladies.
7485403	7487125	So it's almost the same thing.
7487205	7489648	So this is just playing for points at this point.
7489708	7490408	Racking up the points.
7490909	7493752	So DarkSakura, you can have pictures of?
7494052	7494853	Big Black Cock.
7495274	7496515	Big Black Cock.
7499338	7499979	Not a match.
7500039	7501140	And erotica's too broad.
7501200	7501340	What?
7501480	7501680	What?
7503271	7504351	Sorry, that's not a match.
7504451	7506612	Loki has firmly said that's not a match.
7507052	7509913	All right, Tiara, you can't have pictures of?
7510273	7511673	Iraqi suicide babies.
7511833	7513933	Iraqi suicide babies.
7514313	7517034	That is actually the first thing I put down, and I changed it.
7517154	7517794	That's amazing.
7518414	7519275	All right, not a match.
7521155	7525416	But you know, if I am going to make a level, it will have Iraqi suicide babies in there.
7526396	7529697	All right, Loki, you can't have pictures of?
7531068	7532409	Um, blood and tits.
7532910	7535692	That's what I put in my... Blood and tits.
7535732	7537253	That's fairly erotic.
7539535	7544178	But I feel like if we're going to give it to Ranma, then we also need to give it to X-Link for nude ladies.
7545599	7546200	Alright, so why not?
7546220	7547101	We'll give them both a point.
7547141	7547481	Why not?
7547681	7549002	Yay!
7549042	7549923	A point for everybody!
7549943	7550303	Yay!
7550363	7551084	Blood and tits.
7553225	7553566	Alright.
7554286	7558209	Drew, you can't have pictures of... Iraqi suicide babies.
7558269	7560291	Iraqi suicide babies.
7561673	7568179	And my answer was, you can't have pictures of Cylon-occupied Caprica because it's copyrighted.
7568279	7570360	See, I went from one OLR joke to another.
7570440	7571201	That's what I did.
7571421	7571962	There you go.
7572802	7574964	You can't have pictures of Cylon-occupied Caprica.
7575485	7580409	But see, Iraqi Suicide Babies is not copyrighted, but Cylon-occupied Caprica is.
7580429	7581190	That's why I changed it.
7581390	7582871	I'll put a fucking copyright on it.
7582991	7583251	All right.
7585573	7590295	Alright, I love some of the answers the chat room came up with here.
7590335	7591395	This is great.
7591515	7593216	Two Men Kissing was one of them.
7594896	7597177	Pictures of Sky's Old Public Access Show.
7597637	7598177	Tingle.
7599018	7600038	I didn't even think of that one.
7600078	7600778	That's a great one.
7600838	7601598	Tingle Penis.
7602199	7603099	Lego Tingle.
7605640	7606320	I have judgment.
7606780	7607500	Alright, good job.
7607540	7608981	Alright, we have more.
7610421	7611322	Ranma, it's all tied up.
7611342	7611902	How are you feeling?
7613083	7614203	I feel the pressure's on me.
7614364	7615664	The pressure is fuckin' on.
7615704	7616344	Alright, here we go.
7616805	7618845	Question number four.
7620146	7621647	Now they're not about the hosts anymore.

7754663	7755664	That's a damn good answer.
7755724	7756044	Good job.
7756904	7758005	Drew, they will have a?
7758265	7760827	A champagne room.

7774741	7776542	Come on, because you all love guns.
7776642	7778082	Of course there's going to be a gun room.
7779223	7779603	All right.
7780583	7781844	Still tied up 3-3.
7781884	7783284	What the hell happens if we have a tie?
7784185	7784745	Oh, shit.
7785025	7787186	We have to play all night long until the tie is broken.
7787206	7788266	It's like baseball.
7788447	7789327	All right, here we go.
7790227	7790547	Shit.
7791068	7791368	All right.

7837469	7838129	I did.
7838330	7839931	Alright, I think everybody's dinged.
7839971	7841372	I think I heard Ranma ding.
7841392	7841992	That was quick.
7842112	7842252	Yep.
7842593	7842893	Alright.
7843613	7846515	Ranma, little did you know that Drew is here tonight to steal your prize.
7846555	7851178	Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on... Warcraft.
7851479	7852379	Warcraft!
7853560	7857163	And X-Link says he was planning on spending the gift card on... Porn.
7857763	7858524	Porn.
7859721	7860601	Pornography.
7860641	7861422	All right, let's see.
7861982	7864823	We got two pretty extreme different answers there.
7865163	7867004	This could make all the difference.
7867084	7870845	DarkSakura, he's spending the gift card on porn.
7871165	7872385	Porn!
7873326	7875266	Ooh, X-Link pulls ahead, but it's not over yet.
7875867	7876487	It's not over yet.
7877607	7877887	All right.
7880388	7880728	Sauce.
7882509	7884270	She says she couldn't use fanboy wank again.
7884730	7885010	All right.
7886815	7889217	Sauce, he's going to spend the gift card on?
7889557	7891138	I actually did say Warcraft.
7891198	7892259	Warcraft.
7892399	7893080	Oh, man.
7893480	7894481	It's tied again.
7895081	7895521	Oh, man.
7895561	7896702	It's back to 4-4.
7896762	7897242	Let's see.
7897783	7898183	All right.
7899644	7900124	Amazing.
7900545	7900825	All right.
7900905	7903006	Loki, he's going to spend the gift card on?
7903427	7904747	I didn't say either of those.
7904807	7906228	I said Better Joke Books.
7906509	7907990	Better Joke Books.
7908490	7909451	Oh, he might need that.
7910231	7914135	Alright, so Drew, it comes down to you and me.
7914435	7915356	Maybe one of us matches.
7916737	7917458	You want me to go first?
7918299	7918980	I think you should.
7919180	7919901	Alright, you think I should?
7920181	7924605	Alright, I said he's going to spend his gift card on a life.
7926387	7926987	Boo.
7927108	7928729	But I put a heart next to it, so it's okay.
7928789	7929470	It's just a joke.
7929550	7931712	But he's going to spend his gift card on actually getting a life.
7932313	7932773	I'm just kidding.
7933240	7933922	Love you, bro.
7934403	7934724	All right.
7935305	7940799	Drew, he's going to spend the gift card on... Getting Kim to California, you fucking perverts.
7945635	7947696	So the match game ends tonight in a tie.
7947756	7949137	What do we do in case of a tie?
7949197	7949778	Lie radio.
7949798	7950878	Do we have to do another question?
7951359	7951779	I'll do one.
7951839	7952079	I'll do one.
7952099	7952319	No, no.
7952379	7953760	I get the gift card just as planned.
7953900	7954420	No, no, Drew.
7954461	7954781	I'll do one.
7954821	7955121	I'll do one.
7955161	7955701	You're going to do one?
7955721	7955941	I'll do one.
7955961	7956282	I'll do one.
7956622	7956942	All right.
7957062	7957983	One more question.
7958343	7961425	This is coming from... Completely off the top of my head.
7961585	7962846	I'm a little worried about this one.
7963106	7965868	You have to talk fast because I have to message it to X-Link, okay?
7966228	7966488	Okay.
7966608	7966868	All right.
7967068	7967268	Go.
7967949	7972051	During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie.
7972232	7973732	They couldn't think up another...
7976266	7977627	Another question for Match Game.
7978027	7981549	So instead, they decided to settle the tie by a blank.
7987872	7989352	I repeat, if I can remember.
7990313	7995635	During an episode of Orange Sounds Radio, they had a tie in the Match Game.
7996876	8001418	And they couldn't think up another question, so they had to solve the tie by a blank.
8005120	8005601	Ding.
8012588	8013069	Ding.
8014090	8014410	I don't know.
8014430	8016453	How do you guys get your answers so fast?
8017273	8019256	Because I did the obvious answer.
8022930	8025092	Fanboy Wing, of course.
8025973	8029496	Don't be... Don't be giving things away.
8029516	8031658	Just kidding, I didn't... Just kidding.
8032619	8033960	I wouldn't say that, it's retarded.
8038644	8039545	God, I don't know.
8052409	8053550	Okay, I've typed out my answer.
8053610	8054490	It's long and dramatic.
8055171	8056792	Alright, I'm waiting on X-Link.
8059093	8062615	During an episode of Orange Launch Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up another question for match game.
8062955	8066097	So instead, they decided to settle a tie by blank.
8067498	8068699	Which I'm waiting on X-Link still.
8070788	8082337	Lala, Lala, Match Game Music, Match Game Music, Porn Porn, Wank Wank I'm reading some of the comments in chat.
8082357	8083038	They're pretty bad.
8085460	8086381	Butt Sex Battle?
8086521	8086861	Really?
8087381	8087682	Really?
8089403	8089783	Alright.
8090784	8091345	Come on!
8093066	8095528	It's by inflammation.
8096509	8097830	To see who's more inflamed.
8099784	8100726	Is he still in chat?
8101187	8102049	Or did we scare him off?
8103052	8103553	Are you there?
8103573	8108023	Do we have an answer?
8108820	8110100	I like what the Rob D says in chat.
8110120	8113041	The OLR match game wouldn't end and DMN was spamming in chat.
8113081	8116382	Sky then said to DMN, you better stop that you ass piper or I'll blank.
8118602	8119762	Maybe that'll be the next question.
8120903	8121423	Who knows?
8121463	8121823	We'll see.
8122323	8130045	If X-Link doesn't give me an answer in like 15 seconds, I am discounting his answer this round and Ranma will have to match by himself.
8130405	8130785	So here we go.
8130805	8130785	15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 12,
8137710	8146592	10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, oh, oh, oh, oh, there it is, okay, there it is.
8147932	8156954	Alright, finally, Ranma, during an episode of OLR there was a tie and they couldn't think of one, so they decided to sell a tie by... A fight to the flaming death!
8157374	8159494	A fight to the flaming death.
8160675	8161935	And X-Link said...
8163453	8171459	A fight!
8171699	8175301	However, I think we might have a way to break the tie.
8175401	8176042	So, hold on.
8176382	8183707	Alright, so, DarkSakura, they decided to settle the score by... A fight to the finish?
8183927	8185108	A fight to the finish!
8185949	8187129	Alright, so that's a point for each.
8187870	8191833	Alright, Sauce, they decided to settle the score by...
8192332	8212545	SingStarAba Showdown SingStarAba Showdown That's a fight to the death That's a wonderful answer Loki, they decided to settle the score by a tiebreaker You know what, just give Loki the gift card honestly
8220503	8221604	Thunderdome, A Vite to the Finish
8249577	8250818	Alright, so a point for each of them.
8250858	8251258	A fight.
8252058	8252559	Another fight.
8252879	8253159	Okay.
8254019	8254940	Here's the thing, though.
8255320	8256081	Here's my answer.
8258102	8262724	They decided to settle the score by setting the studio on fire.
8262924	8263965	But please don't actually do this.
8264825	8268287	But I'm thinking Ranma did say a fight to the flaming finish.
8269548	8271769	So it might match with Ranma.
8274665	8279148	Alright, so we're still in a tie, so what happens?
8279188	8280029	Does neither one win?
8280329	8282151	One more question!
8282631	8284753	This segment's getting way too long.
8284853	8287735	Read the one that Rob D. Alright, we're going to do Rob D.
8287715	8288215	's question?
8288936	8290077	Alright, this is it.
8290297	8293839	I swear to God, if we don't have a winner here, then I don't know, we'll just give it away next week or something.
8293859	8294600	I don't know what we're going to do.
8295140	8298423	Here it is, or we'll flip a damn coin, says Brad.
8307642	8308102	Orange Lounge Radio
8338583	8339283	Power Chords
8367155	8369096	Oh yeah, why, we can't do the Rob D's question?
8370617	8371198	Okay, we'll do that.
8371638	8380545	Alright, so we're going to do the Rob D's question and this hopefully will fix what's going on here and then we can get on with our lives.
8380605	8382446	Alright, here it is.
8384668	8385829	Last question for the Match Game Night.
8386189	8390352	The OLR Match Game wouldn't end and DMN was spamming in chat.
8390953	8394956	Sky then said to DMN, you better stop that, you ass piper, or I'll blank.
8407177	8407417	Ding.
8410679	8411019	Ding.
8412820	8413940	Did both ladies ding?
8413960	8414341	Okay.
8415861	8417042	At the same... Oh, wow.
8417542	8418103	That's hot.
8419583	8420003	All right.
8422425	8423545	Okay, everybody's dinged.
8424786	8425206	Ranma.
8426267	8426467	Yes.
8426487	8427987	The OLR match game wouldn't end.
8428007	8430849	It's gone on way too long and DMN was spamming in chat.
8431189	8434831	Sky then said to DMN, you better stop that, you ass piper, or I'll what?
8435894	8436594	Violate you.
8437234	8438175	Violate you.
8439115	8439395	All right.
8439415	8443496	And X-Link said, come to your house and break your computer with a gun.
8444297	8444557	All right.
8444637	8446077	Finally, we have two different answers.
8446097	8447478	So hopefully we can finally break the tie.
8447518	8447998	Here we go.
8448338	8450959	Come to your house and break your computer with a gun or violate you.
8451699	8452279	DarkSakura.
8454100	8456941	I put bang you with a big black cock.
8457401	8458821	Bang you with a big black cock.
8459241	8460762	I believe that would be violating you.
8461622	8462062	Ding.
8462662	8463023	All right.
8463043	8463523	Sauce.
8463603	8463983	Sauce.
8465336	8492238	kick you in the balls kick you in the balls not a match Loki, I will destroy you destroy you not a match Drew, I will burn you with an HD DVD laser burn you with an HD DVD laser burn your face off melt your face off with a laser not a match my answer was cuddle with you
8494895	8497678	I think this has been our biggest number of points scored in a match game to date
8517519	8519400	We've got a booby prize for X-Link tonight.
8519480	8527145	We actually have a code still for Banjo-Kazooie on the Xbox 360, Xbox Live Arcade, and we're going to give that to X-Link.
8527705	8529126	So everybody's a winner tonight.
8529566	8530887	Yay!
8530907	8531387	So there you go.
8531807	8540412	I just want to say, Ranchan, if you'll send me a private message on Twitter with your email address, I'll email you the Amazon gift card certificate thingy.
8541092	8541372	All right.
8541953	8542593	Yay!
8542793	8545775	And do you want to say anything lastly to the chatters who say it was rigged?
8548177	8550018	Um, yeah.
8550879	8553020	Ha, ha, ha.
8553981	8554621	So eloquent.
8554861	8555702	All right, have a good one, Ranma.
8556362	8556863	Bye-bye.
8557123	8557463	Bye.
8558184	8563167	Okay, that segment was only 32 minutes long, according to Ranma's call.
8563387	8564187	Dear Lord.
8564788	8571612	Well, keep in mind, you know, for about five minutes of that, we were experiencing technical difficulties.
8573573	8576775	Alright, so to everybody who didn't win tonight, boo-hoo for you.
8577736	8580898	But we've got some more news to do and then we're going to take a couple quick, quick calls tonight.
8580958	8583960	Unfortunately, we've got to keep it short tonight because we did not expect Match Game to take so long.
8584000	8584740	I apologize for that.
8585021	8585381	But you know what?
8585401	8586361	It was a slow news week.
8586401	8586842	It's a deal.
8587402	8588303	Just deal, okay?
8588443	8588683	Deal.
8589483	8589764	Loki!
8591304	8597047	Haven't you ever thought to yourself when playing a game of pinball, gee, I wish I could learn about flatulence right now?
8597427	8607091	Well, now you can, thanks to a custom pinball game called Gas Attack that was part of an exhibit in Grossology.
8607791	8623897	and apparently these two exhibits, or this part of the exhibit, your pinball is actually bacteria and you bump it into different foods that cause flatulence, including meat, onions, you name it.
8625137	8632440	Yes, cabbage is on there, brussel sprouts, cheese, all sorts of stuff.
8633280	8637042	And they do have a picture of intestines right above it.
8638394	8639054	Is that the ramp?
8640735	8642155	No, that's not the ramp.
8642696	8649178	There's actually a few clear ramps that are in there, but it has a toilet and a bunch of other stuff on there.
8649418	8652099	Pretty basic looking, but it gets the message across, I guess.
8652439	8653419	That is something else.
8654060	8654740	That's amazing.
8656420	8657921	Frisbee asked the question I want to know.
8657961	8658821	Where can I play this?
8661942	8665564	You know, I'm not sure where this exhibit's actually at.
8666144	8666244	Um...
8668303	8670244	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8688274	8693497	Well, I don't know if this game is going to be any better or worse, but... Oh, sorry, to interrupt real quick.
8693537	8701982	You can actually find out more about the Grossology Tour by going to grossologytour.com, and they have, I think, the dates that they'll be available.
8702602	8703283	Well, how convenient.
8704423	8704723	All right.
8705144	8707425	Well, hey, if that game doesn't sound like your...
8708362	8710563	Your idea of a good time, maybe this one will be a little better.
8710723	8715325	It's Push-Up Foo is a new game that has come out for the iPhone.
8715406	8722069	It's a part of a series called the Foo Apps, like Shaq Foo, but this is called Push-Up Foo.
8722809	8731814	And apparently what this is, it uses the device's accelerometer to track how many push-ups you're doing and give you feedback on how you're doing with your push-ups.
8732674	8734035	So that's kind of interesting, I guess.
8735015	8742158	I don't know if you put the thing on your back or something or where you put this when you're doing your push-ups, but I guess it actually tracks how many push-ups you're doing and how well you've done.
8742438	8743439	But here's the other cool thing.
8743939	8750061	Push-up Fu also lets you join a tracked league or you can go head-to-head in what's called a battle mode.
8750922	8753703	Apparently there's a course in it that trains you to do 100 push-ups.
8756845	8760287	So that's kind of an interesting use for the iPhone.
8760647	8762368	Kind of like throwing a Wii Fit angle into it.
8762709	8768893	Or teaching you how to shake or tilt the iPhone into thinking that you've done 100 push-ups.
8769273	8770014	For real, huh?
8770054	8774217	Just like how you can shake the remote and it makes Wii Fit think you're jogging.
8776707	8785290	But, you know, this might actually be kind of a fun competitive way, like, to do, like, if you and your friends are doing it for, like, actual push-ups, this might be kind of a fun way to motivate people.
8785450	8785791	I don't know.
8786371	8787691	I hope they come out with other versions of it.
8789012	8789352	We'll see.
8790913	8792613	GS68 says you put it in your pants.
8793834	8795094	I always put it in my pants.
8795755	8796035	All right.
8796775	8797475	Anyhow, I don't know.
8797935	8798716	It looks interesting.
8799036	8800236	If it's free, I'll check it out.
8800276	8801697	If it's not, then I probably won't.
8802469	8807812	Well, I... Actually, I have this that I'm reporting on next.
8808932	8812674	You can get Game & Watch games on your iPhone.
8813615	8815196	And I've downloaded two of them.
8816797	8826082	Basically, they're done a little differently, but they still really are the Game & Watch games.
8826582	8830164	You've got Parachute, Chef, Fire, and Octopus games.
8831525	8836907	Um, but they're called GW Parachute, GW Chef, GW Fire, GW Octopus.
8837007	8838088	They're $1.99.
8839128	8844411	Um, and then, um, wait till Nintendo hears about it.
8844631	8846672	Yeah, hurry before a cease and desist gets sent.
8846832	8847592	It's pretty fun.
8848373	8849593	Which will probably be Monday.
8850233	8851134	You better get them now.
8853676	8862599	I saw something on one of those gaming blogs that was talking about an app that wasn't accepted into Apple's app store there.
8862860	8869142	Apparently it was a booby shaking game that you can shake your iPhone in the boob shake.
8869762	8870143	Awesome.
8871483	8872684	And this wasn't accepted, why?
8873344	8876886	Because apparently it's inappropriate for people.
8877226	8877766	I don't know.
8878606	8879087	Whatever.
8879987	8880147	Yeah.
8880649	8880929	GripShift
8904710	8905510	Thanks for watching!
8935580	8937562	So in other words, they just need to give up on patching it already.
8937583	8938584	They should just give up.
8938844	8940346	But hey, you know... But they won't.
8940366	8944691	Don't they think they kind of owe it to the people that make games for their system?
8945232	8945873	Yeah, I guess.
8946453	8946714	Whatever.
8946734	8947795	But it'll never ever work.
8949281	8951863	Well, hey, Tomb Raider Underworld.
8951883	8954064	If you're a fan of Tomb Raider Underworld, guess what?
8954104	8955785	You can download the soundtrack for free.
8956326	8957266	That's right, free.
8958627	8971936	What you can actually choose, you can choose some songs that are associated with the game's locals, or you can get a deluxe edition soundtrack that contains all 71 tracks, 320 kbps mp3 formats.
8972396	8972937	So there you go.
8973057	8978240	All you have to do to get the soundtrack, it's a free download, tombraidercronicles.com.
8979441	8981502	slash underworld slash soundtrack.html.
8981522	8983923	It's all there for download if you want to check out some of the music from the game.
8985563	8986704	That's not too shabby.
8987264	8987904	That's special.
8988244	8989305	Who likes free stuff?
8989685	8990265	I know I do.
8990705	8991466	I don't like Yaris.
8991846	8992166	All right.
8992186	8993306	Oh, yeah, it's true.
8993846	8995867	How about some last-minute stories tonight?
8995887	8997288	Do we have any last-minute stories here?
8997308	8998168	We didn't do FUs.
8999108	9000149	We didn't do FUs?
9000809	9002990	I neglected to put it in the showroom.
9003050	9003610	FU!
9005051	9005871	Oh, my gosh.
9006091	9006511	F me.
9007892	9008592	How horrible.
9009244	9010606	Don't worry, we're still plenty pissed off
9041898	9050129	FU goes to be woken up from a deep sleep this morning to be bitched at.
9054134	9054595	That's it.
9055456	9056157	And the damn table.
9057138	9057579	Uh, sauce.
9059892	9085975	I'll try to keep this short but Ranchan sent me a Christmas card for Christmas obviously and when I received it the envelope had been completely opened on three sides by someone else who obviously thought that maybe there was games and prizes inside of some sort but F you to that person who opened it and F you to my mailman who delivered it to the wrong place Loki
9087694	9087874	Drew?
9088014	9088154	Drew?
9115786	9117107	F you to the card table.
9118648	9124113	F you to UPS being unnaturally slow in bringing me my new mouse.
9124753	9128396	Ordered a G9 for like 45 bucks last week.
9128976	9131778	It's taken 10 days to get to my house.
9131838	9136182	Right now it's sitting over the weekend in West Sac, 10 miles away.
9136922	9139084	When it should be, you know, on my desk.
9140965	9144348	Also F you to being sick and sleeping all the time when you're sick.
9148151	9149933	Yeah, I'm going to have to echo some of what Drew said.
9149953	9153238	F you to being sick, especially the week before I'm supposed to go on vacation.
9153338	9155962	Four days before I'm supposed to go on vacation, I'm getting sick.
9157224	9157784	God hates me.
9158185	9159687	Also, F you to people named Alex.
9160228	9160969	No, you're done.
9162191	9163412	Okay, F you Alex, whoever you are.
9164033	9164314	Alright.
9165825	9168846	Anyhow, we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit.
9168866	9170287	We'll take a couple calls tonight.
9170707	9177050	Again, we ran a little long because of match games, so we don't want to go on all night long because we still have an afterbirth we've got to get to because we didn't do an afterbirth last week.
9178190	9180471	Boy, oh boy, just too much going on here at Last Minute Stories.
9180971	9181651	Oh, last minute stories.
9181691	9183152	I'm sorry, Loki, do you have something you want to get to?
9183312	9184012	Yes, real quick.
9184032	9185033	This is kind of a funny one.
9186633	9192775	We have EA branching out into a new field of video games, for them at least.
9193355	9198277	They're tackling the love simulation market with a brand new game.
9200658	9203821	That's actually coming out in Japan.
9204381	9213608	It's Hachio Koi, and it's a game that features big-breasted women that you apparently rub tanning lotion on.
9216050	9216330	Nice.
9217491	9217731	Nice.
9218832	9219173	All right.
9220514	9220954	Let's see.
9221074	9223276	We are now on the Skype line with a caller.
9223336	9223856	Hi, caller.
9223876	9224256	Who's this?
9225477	9227079	Hi, this is Spazinator.
9227299	9227959	Hi, Spazinator.
9227979	9228680	What's on your mind tonight?
9231547	9232148	Two things.
9233989	9236752	First of all, I've got some news for you.
9237032	9241436	I managed to update my, or replace my PlayStation 3.
9243497	9247921	It's not exactly the same model as I had before, but I'll take what I can get.
9248562	9249082	Yeah, that's right.
9249102	9250984	The ongoing saga of the stolen PlayStation 3.
9251284	9254707	So unfortunately, it sounds like it was never found, but you got a replacement.
9256108	9257289	Yeah.
9257749	9257870	And...
9258866	9267190	Now, I just basically checked out home for the first time since I replaced my PlayStation 3.
9267911	9286120	And I don't know if you know anything about it, but wasn't there supposed to be something in home that basically allowed you to go into your pocket or whatever, bring your friends in and be able to stream your music or videos and photos and stuff like that?
9286761	9299975	Yeah, that was in the early beta, but unfortunately it does not look like that function has hit the finished product, much like half of the other things that Sony said was going to be in there, such as the trophy cases you were going to have for all the trophies that you get in the games, and a couple other things.
9300616	9306142	I think they were probably a little worried, as they should be, about people putting copyright content all over their house.
9308183	9309784	Yeah, and in a way I can see why they're kind of hesitant.
9309844	9310904	It's not just for copyrighted stuff.
9336550	9348639	But you know how the media and other people whose names I won't mention like to get all up in arms about stupid things.
9348979	9360588	If they had put the streaming functionality into home, someone would have been stupid enough to stream porn or whatever it is.
9361707	9371741	Someone will kill, see it, and all of a sudden, you know, we'll be getting a gas link to the fire, you know, give those people ammo to shoot us with, you know.
9374008	9377209	Well, I mean, if somebody's going to do something inappropriate, they should just simply be banned.
9377229	9379869	There should be a really, really easy way to report and ban those people.
9380889	9384730	There already should be something set up because there's already some craziness going on at home.
9384990	9387011	But I'll tell you my favorite thing I've discovered to do at home.
9387351	9392672	I like to go in the movie theater where the previews are playing, especially when there's like one preview playing over and over and over again.
9393272	9395992	And I like to go stand right in the middle of the screen and dance.
9397513	9398833	That's my favorite thing to do at home.
9399505	9401086	Yeah, I've seen people do that already.
9401106	9402006	Sure, thank you.
9402026	9402246	Later, dude.
9426175	9427095	And check out Prince of Persia.
9427115	9428556	That's another game I've been playing more of lately.
9428576	9429196	That's a fun game.
9429496	9431557	I love Prince of Persia because it's for dummies like me.
9431597	9432417	You can't die.
9433117	9434637	She always freaking saves you.
9435718	9437198	The little sidekick you roll with.
9437218	9438698	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9438759	9439799	Another last minute story, Loki?
9441499	9442620	Yes, actually.
9442940	9452002	Apparently GameStop is no longer accepting Xbox game systems or accessories in trade effective February 9th.
9452282	9453843	Even though more people are playing them than PS3s?
9453883	9453963	Yes.
9456536	9459958	If you're playing them, you're certainly not playing them from GameStop now.
9460078	9461059	So hurry up and get them in.
9461499	9461719	Yes.
9462459	9462880	Alright.
9465081	9468743	And then also, Wii Sports is now the best-selling game of all time.
9470264	9472145	It's even exceeded Super Mario Bros.
9473325	9473726	Amazing.
9474186	9475086	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9475106	9475427	Who's this?
9476307	9478668	It's obviously, you know who, Legend of Zaku.
9478708	9479429	Legend of Zaku.
9479509	9479789	What's up?
9480916	9487957	Nah, nothing much, just celebrating, just bringing in the new year with mediocrity and just a boring weekend, generally.
9488597	9489978	Yeah?
9490438	9492178	How did you celebrate?
9492578	9494098	What types of games did you play?
9495079	9495959	Oh, for New Year's?
9496079	9497119	Oh, that's simple.
9497199	9500119	Drunken Left 4 Dead, after the ball dropped.
9500500	9500840	Nice.
9501160	9504460	Oh, that's one of those games I've got to play still.
9504480	9508441	But yeah, definitely playing Left 4 Dead in the dark.
9509439	9512061	with other people while really hammered up.
9512722	9515584	I'm worried that game will actually make me shit my pants.
9516204	9518125	That's what I'm worried about with that game.
9518666	9522308	It's nothing compared to the other classical movies like Dawn of the Dead.
9523069	9526091	Although it would be cool if they had a mall map for Left 4 Dead.
9526771	9527952	Give it that authentic feeling.
9528873	9531755	But besides that, that's the only excitement I had last week.
9532415	9534216	Everything else afterwards has just been ho-hum.
9535493	9540694	Yeah, money's tight, so if I don't have money to go out, I might as well stay at home.
9540935	9543795	What are you looking forward to most in 2009?
9545996	9547676	Well, let me see.
9547796	9564521	Besides digital life hopefully coming back, other things, you know, E3 being open to the public and all, hopefully other companies not getting the axe, and generally just damn good games coming out.
9565319	9573583	I hope Sony could definitely make it the year of the PS3, unlike the critics who've already said that.
9575237	9580000	I've already said that sort of thing last year and the year before that, and it went wrong.
9580080	9581661	It's going to take something big, but who knows?
9582101	9587264	E3 could be... This is going to be a big, big year for E3.
9587664	9589885	With E3 going back in the public spectacle.
9590425	9592727	Yeah, it's going back to the circus.
9593087	9594147	You can expect that.
9594228	9595988	That is going to be one huge thing in 2009.
9596088	9598130	E3 2009 is going to be bigger than any E3 in the past five years.
9600931	9618377	I mean, look, it could either play as a boon for the ESA or it could be another big clusterfuck like the E3s of years past where you had booth babes, just a lot of game devs basically crunching for that single demo that they're going to showcase on E3.
9618417	9624339	So I don't know whether that's worth the effort to actually go back.
9624859	9627860	Now GameGuru in chat says E3 will bomb and no one will care.
9628480	9628740	We'll see.
9628780	9629100	I don't know.
9629120	9629801	I disagree.
9629861	9632001	I mean, that's one opinion.
9632201	9643005	I guess if that person's trying to be realistic given the state of the economy, unless for some reason the economy rebounds over the summer, then you'll see a massive circus like the old ones.
9643626	9644966	Yeah, I think it's going to be a heck of a circus.
9644986	9646087	Hopefully it'll still be alive.
9647307	9652089	Unlike the last year and the 2007 one with just bombs.
9653009	9655250	Literally ho-hum and just boring as hell.
9656553	9666097	I didn't do nothing to keep it originally as a business expo, whereas the old ones pretty much brought back the hype.
9666797	9667757	They had the hype right there.
9668418	9670458	And the hype ended up selling the games.
9672019	9675060	Well, we will see what develops.
9675340	9682443	I'm sorry, I'm being distracted by chat room where a picture of me pretending to kiss DMN at PAX was posted in chat.
9682483	9683843	I don't know why that happened.
9683903	9684864	Why did that have to happen?
9685666	9685966	I don't know.
9686066	9686286	All right.
9686786	9688367	Anyhow, Zaku, thank you so much for your call.
9689187	9689567	All right.
9689787	9690187	Later, dude.
9690207	9690367	Bye.
9692808	9694288	We got time for maybe one more call.
9694408	9697769	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAMEOLR.
9697869	9699549	Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9700230	9702270	I'm looking at pictures from people's New Year's party.
9702310	9703170	What the hell is this?
9703210	9704951	You got like five people playing the same game?
9705591	9706471	What the hell is this?
9707171	9707891	Is that Left 4 Dead?
9707911	9708972	Is that what they're all playing?
9710092	9710612	I can't tell.
9712653	9714433	SJ100Mal, what are they all playing in this picture?
9718837	9719838	I can't see.
9719858	9722019	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call.
9724020	9725982	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9727343	9728764	Gears 2, thank you.
9728904	9730445	God, all I needed was a simple answer.
9730465	9730985	No, I'm just kidding.
9732126	9733026	Okay, I get it.
9733146	9733827	Oh, I get it now.
9734687	9735048	Alright.
9736389	9736829	There you go.
9736929	9738090	It's kind of hard to see the screens.
9739050	9741712	Alright, I'm not seeing the phone ring.
9741992	9743233	I'll give it one more minute.
9743253	9745915	Do we have any other last minute stories or we're done?
9747737	9758846	Major Nelson has revealed what the top 20 Xbox downloads were for the top live titles and top arcade titles.
9760107	9763090	The top arcade titles, starting with...
9764537	9766919	Castle Crashers Geometry Wars 2 Kingdom for Keflings 5 UNO
9783714	9797401	6, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix 7, Fable 2 Pub Games 8, Duke Nukem 3D 9, Bionic Commando Rearmed and 10, Worms Where was Res HD on that list?
9798341	9798721	Where was it?
9798782	9808487	Res HD, not on that list Shameful, shameful Mega Man 9, number 16 Original Doom beat out Mega Man 9
9809685	9812847	Alright, Rob D is on the Skype line.
9812887	9813408	What's up, Rob?
9814048	9814408	What's up?
9814769	9816790	Looks like I've made a good OLR to listen to.
9816810	9818911	This is the first time in a while that I actually haven't worked.
9819572	9822794	I mean, you guys are just playing the match game, you're knocking soundboards off the table.
9823014	9824375	I know, it's been a pretty epic night.
9825376	9826076	What's on your mind?
9826817	9829218	We have to ring in 2009, the only way we know how.
9829919	9830299	Exactly.
9831300	9831720	Not too much.
9831840	9838465	Well, I hear you didn't like HD Remix, and I know that I'm a little bit late on the draw because you talked about HD Remix a couple weeks ago, and...
9839642	9846404	I gotta say, I'm pretty much in love with the game, so I was just calling in to disagree with you a little bit on that, for the contrasting view.
9846765	9853647	You know, I just didn't find that there was, I don't know, like, Street Fighter 2 is one of those things I find that is better left in my memory.
9854207	9854767	You know what I mean?
9854948	9866612	Like, it's just not something, I think this is, and I've had time to reflect on what the hell is my big problem with this game anyway, and I think, honestly, what it boils down to is that a lot of my problem with the game is boiled down to the shift to Xbox Live.
9867592	9869194	and PlayStation Network for these games.
9869574	9876202	And that it just doesn't have the same magic as it does when you actually walk into an arcade and you get to shit talk someone like right there.
9878544	9883469	You know, that's actually standing there next to you because people say things online that they would not say to your face.
9884150	9887395	That's one thing that I'm quickly learning about Xbox Live.
9887835	9890639	As for the game itself, I hated the soundtrack.
9890740	9892903	That was my number one bitch about the game.
9893463	9900253	And I know they were trying to do the right thing by doing the fan remixes and everything, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the gesture, but the soundtrack was...
9901014	9901694	Street Fighter 4
9923089	9923369	I did.
9923409	9924290	I really did like the originals.
9942914	9948978	It's great that Capcom actually did go to the guys at GGPO and actually got their help with the netcode.
9949239	9954342	I mean, the multiplayer for Street Fighter 2 is... I don't want to call it flawless, because there are a couple problems.
9954743	9960367	I mean, even then, lag does pop up occasionally, but I never thought they'd actually be able to get a fighting game this good online.
9961517	9973361	and just actually seeing this, actually being able to play Toshin up in Canada or being able to play even Shadowswire across in the UK with no lag or very negligible lag, it blows my mind, frankly.
9974659	9979301	It's like I'm literally playing them in the arcade right next to them as far as the lag goes.
9979601	9987084	Maybe I need to play against more real people I know and not random people because I played this all at a friend's house because I actually don't even own the game.
9987124	9988065	I actually played it on PlayStation 3.
9990006	9991146	But yeah, I don't know.
9991466	9995028	Oh god, the Xbox 360 controller still is such an issue.
9995168	10000310	I feel like if I did get the game, I'd have to get it on PlayStation 3 and even then I don't know a lot of people on there.
10002096	10008920	Yeah, I've been enjoying actually playing a few people from the all-games community and the OLR community over in HD Remix, so that hasn't been so much of a problem for me.
10010161	10012102	It's been a learning curve to actually get used to the controller.
10012402	10015944	The D-pad is leaving calluses on my thumbs, frankly.
10016504	10019186	And I've had to use the control stick for anyone who's not a Shotokan character.
10019960	10022282	Do we have a lot of OLR people that play Left 4 Dead on PC?
10023103	10028847	I know this is a completely random topic, but I'm kind of curious because I'm actually thinking about getting Left 4 Dead, but on PC, not 360.
10029448	10032951	Just because first-person shooters, I think I could do better on PC than I can on 360.
10032991	10034712	I just want to throw that out there.
10034992	10037634	What you can do is join the Steam community.
10037815	10039656	Orange Lounge Radio does have a Steam community.
10039876	10041718	Is there actually people that are still using it?
10042078	10042959	Yeah, I'm on it.
10043439	10043779	Interesting.
10043939	10044199	All right.
10044600	10047661	Maybe I'll have to play Left 4 Dead sometime, because I think I'm going to pick that up sooner rather than later.
10048121	10048621	Anyway, sorry.
10048981	10052263	Didn't mean to disrail what Rob D had originally called in about.
10052683	10059246	Yeah, you know, I noticed the fighting game fans especially really are in love with HD remakes, and maybe I didn't give it a fair look, but I don't know.
10059266	10062807	It just didn't resonate the way with me that it did the rest of you.
10062867	10068750	I guess maybe I was just so hyped up for it to be this new and something so different, but it was just kind of like...
10069910	10070291	I don't know.
10070351	10071772	It just felt like a letdown to me.
10072193	10072934	It's hard to explain.
10073474	10079180	I'm looking forward to Street Fighter 4 as well, and if they actually get the netcode half as good on that game as they did in Street Fighter HD Remix, I'll be happy.
10079761	10080302	I will say that.
10080322	10082144	I'm definitely looking forward to Street Fighter 4 as well.
10082184	10083645	I will definitely pick that up when it comes out.
10083926	10085647	So we will have that to battle on, if nothing else.
10086268	10089772	And nothing will match the magic of actually playing someone in an arcade right next to them, you know.
10091242	10100813	The shadiness of the arcade aside, because let's face it, some arcades are better left to our memories rather than to our current sense of smell today.
10101313	10102715	Yeah, good point, good point.
10103530	10103770	All right.
10104070	10110635	Well, Rob D., I've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for your call, and have fun battling the fellow listeners online.
10110895	10111516	That's great to hear.
10111776	10112757	Actdeft, you're going down.
10113017	10113537	See you later.
10113918	10114198	Later.
10115198	10117060	I guess they're already setting up a battle after the show.
10117380	10125206	That's one of the great things about doing a radio show like Orange Launch Radio is we are moving into 2009, which, if you can believe it, we started this show in 2002.
10126286	10132671	So now this is our seventh year of broadcasting, if you can believe it, and it's really neat to see the community growing
10132731	10134993	That's kind of built up and that people kind of do this stuff.
10135033	10137154	That makes what we do here so worthwhile.
10138255	10139536	Card table's being knocked over and all.
10139816	10140516	Speaking of which.
10140616	10140836	Yes.
10142838	10146820	Got a message from Ranma with all the people who chipped in on that whiteboard for you guys.
10147421	10147741	Yes.
10148442	10149802	I was seeing some stuff in chat.
10149822	10150483	What is going on?
10150743	10155026	I thought that this was just something Ranma got from his connections or something.
10155866	10157127	We pooled our money together.
10157167	10157868	Shut up.
10158368	10162491	Me, Ranma, Misty, SSJ100Matt, and AlphaCanonogram.
10163171	10164471	All pitched in to get you the whiteboard.
10184076	10184737	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10213406	10214347	Like Benny Hill, right?
10214507	10216768	We're old and dead.
10217649	10218069	Not that bad.
10218089	10219430	We are far from decrepit.
10219550	10223953	Trust me, JTV, I will stop at nothing to get JTV back next week.
10224253	10224853	Or in two weeks.
10225153	10235720	I did want to say a very public thank you to Ikuma JP for the webcam that he sent us that I left at my house along with a lot of candy he sent us.
10236600	10237061	Really?
10237381	10239243	Like from Japan and stuff?
10239263	10239463	Yeah.
10239764	10240324	Awesome.
10240465	10241205	Oh, I love candy.
10241225	10241906	If you eat it all.
10242246	10243748	No, but... I'm shaking my finger at you.
10244249	10244929	No, that's awesome.
10244969	10245690	This is great.
10246191	10246591	Wow.
10247152	10250175	I never would have imagined that listeners would like do stuff for us.
10250255	10250676	That's great.
10252197	10254158	I mean, really, like, I don't know what else to say.
10254218	10255439	That's an amazing feeling.
10255479	10259861	So thank you guys so much for pulling together, especially behind all of our backs and sending that to us.
10259901	10260381	That's great.
10260541	10261462	That's really awesome.
10261722	10263383	And thank you to our listeners overseas.
10263723	10270626	And guys, Jamie's like, see, Jamie gets the international gifts because she was getting, she got the Doctor Who game from the UK, right?
10270726	10272027	And now you get the stuff from Japan.
10272087	10273367	Well, no, that's for all of us.
10273547	10276729	It just, I had them delivered to my house because I didn't have your address handy.
10277034	10277274	I know.
10277314	10281796	Footy, maybe you should get Jamie's address so you can send something from Argentina.
10282336	10282816	And then what else?
10282876	10283576	Other countries we have.
10283596	10286437	We have the guy Aki Ripper.
10286737	10288658	This year is the international year for DarkSakura.
10290398	10294060	Don't jeer at me, DarkSakura.
10294100	10294480	You love it.
10294500	10294820	I'm not.
10295140	10296301	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10296321	10296541	I'm hungry.
10296561	10298283	Sauce, thank you so much for making the trip here from Vegas.
10298303	10302406	AvengersTower.com if you want to see the well-done reviews and for all the nerdy things that you kids love.
10302426	10303007	Your final thought tonight?
10322048	10323510	So long and thanks for all the fish.
10323910	10324471	You're welcome.
10326954	10329537	Remind me to tell you about the fish inside named Puppy at some point.
10329557	10331999	I know you know, but the listeners, maybe in two weeks.
10332320	10333201	Loki, your final thought.
10334582	10335884	So tempting.
10336805	10337225	What is?
10337606	10337886	Nothing.
10338146	10338487	Stuff.
10339548	10339928	Uh-oh.
10340669	10340950	Uh-oh.
10341771	10342692	All right, Drew.
10344045	10345826	Sorry about the freaking table.
10346207	10346727	It's alright.
10347407	10350410	And my final thought is I need more Jelly Bellies.
10350470	10351330	Do you see this bag?
10351370	10352311	This bag is empty.
10352931	10356914	And it needs to be filled with more Jelly Bellies because Jelly Bellies are amazing.
10357254	10360357	And by the way, next time you're in NorCal, have you ever been to the Jelly Belly Factory, Sauce?
10360677	10363459	We are so going to the Jelly Belly Factory.
10363519	10364600	I will take a day off of work, okay?
10364920	10367502	So you let me know when you're in town next and we'll go to the Jelly Belly Factory, okay?
10367742	10370324	I'll go to M&M's when I'm in Vegas and you can go to Jelly Bellies when you're up here.
10370604	10370824	Alright.
10371404	10372045	I'll make it work out.
10372505	10372765	Alright.
10372785	10373406	Um...
