17380	22240	get dressed for a rave, is rock band getting a lego themed expansion, and can you turn
22240	32400	your old hdvd player into a burning laser?
32400	35380	Hi everybody and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio.
35380	40360	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
40360	41360	lifestyle.
41360	45920	I should say welcome to a new year of orange lounge radio because you know haha it is 2009,
45920	48360	our first show of the year.
48360	50600	My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you tonight.
50600	55480	As always, my faithful co-hosts, partners in crime, say hello to the one and only dark
55480	56960	sakura, Jamie Summers.
56960	57960	Snorlax.
57960	58960	How are you Snorlax?
58960	59960	Hey.
59960	60960	Hey.
60960	61960	I'm doing okay.
61960	66920	You know I was having a conversation about Pokemon and WoW the other day, don't ask,
66920	70160	but have you ever seen the Pokemon Jynx?
70160	71160	No.
71160	76920	Jynx looks like a giant drag queen, google it, google Jynx Pokemon, it's hilarious, anyway
76920	80280	sorry I'm completely random like the rest of the show.
80280	83440	Say hello to our very own drag queen here in studio, Techmaster Loki.
83440	87640	I'm sorry you must be talking about Andrew right here.
87640	93680	I'm sorry I was just imagining you dressed as Tingle because it's seemingly never going
93680	95640	to happen so I just have to imagine it.
95640	96640	Alright.
96640	97640	How are you?
97640	100920	I'm doing fine, it could be better if this would work correctly.
100920	105560	Oh yeah I forgot you have a cam over there, god pointed at my worst possible angle.
105560	106560	It's not working.
106560	107560	Oh that's good.
107560	112200	Because you know like all things Sony it crashes out there a few minutes.
112200	113240	So yeah.
113240	116840	Trying to use the Eye of Judgment for something useful and failing failtastically.
116840	120760	Well yeah it failed just as fast as the Eye of Judgment within about five minutes.
120760	121760	Gotcha.
121760	122760	Amazing.
122760	126840	Also joining us tonight we do have some guests in studio as Loki already mentioned we have
126840	132760	the OLR forever intern Drew is here in house and we'll have to steal Loki's microphone
132760	133760	to be heard.
133760	134760	What's up?
134760	135760	Hi how are you?
135760	136760	Not bad not bad.
136760	137760	Cool cool.
137760	139680	How was your new year?
139680	140960	Pretty quiet.
140960	144680	Champagne got to see how Dick Clark's progressed.
144680	145680	That's about it.
145680	146680	Yeah not good.
146680	147680	Not good apparently.
147680	148680	Prognosis?
148680	149680	I'm a little sad about that.
149680	150680	You old.
150680	151680	Yeah.
151680	152680	Alright.
152680	158780	Also joining us tonight all the way from the city that never sleeps Las Vegas say hello
158780	167880	to T-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-A-R-R-A-R-R-R-A-R-R-A also known as Sauce.
167880	168880	How are you Sauce?
168880	169880	I'm doing pretty good.
169880	170880	How's Vegas?
170880	174040	It's Vegas like it snowed a couple of weeks ago and everybody freaked out.
174040	176320	It doesn't snow in the desert like ever.
176320	177320	Fun times.
177320	179160	Yeah but you're spending the week in Sacramento?
179160	181740	Yeah this is actually my last night here.
181740	182740	Nooo.
182740	183740	Well how was your new year's?
183740	184980	It was fun.
184980	186360	We play a lot of rock band.
186360	187880	Yeah good times.
187880	191800	Now you're at a website now where you talk about all sorts of nerdy things, so you actually
191800	194520	have something to plug tonight, so why don't you plug away?
194520	201480	Well, I have a game slash comic slash book slash other geeky nerdy stuff.
201480	202600	It's a nerd blog.
202600	203600	It's a total nerd.
203600	205000	Anything nerdy, it's there.
205000	206000	Yeah.
206000	212600	It's AvengersTower.com, and actually Jamie made an account on there too, and she's posted
212600	214760	a review on some comics.
214760	219800	So it's just kind of a fun place for all of your nerdy stuff to kind of converge together,
219800	225600	and you'll probably occasionally see references to that one episode of Star Trek The Next
225600	226600	Generation where...
226600	227600	Nice.
227600	228600	Very nice.
228600	233560	Well, best of luck with the blog, and if you want to see two cute nerdy girls giggling
233560	237660	and screaming about comics and things, no, I'm just kidding.
237660	238660	It's a fun read.
238660	239660	You guys are very good writers.
239660	240660	Thank you.
240660	241660	Good luck with that.
241660	244120	It's probably even better than Orangenolenceradio.com, so definitely check it out.
244120	245120	All right.
245120	247480	Let's start off with how is your gaming week?
247480	251200	So Dark Soccer, since you're all big time writing for a big giggling girl blog now,
251200	256560	why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
256560	257560	Giggling Geek Girl.
257560	258560	I like that.
258560	259560	No, I'm just kidding.
259560	260560	No.
260560	266440	I played, of course, Rock Band on New Year's Eve, and that crappy Lips game that was full
266440	271080	of crap and crappiness and songs that I hate.
271080	276320	See, I would have thought Lips was awesome because it's by the Elite Beat Agents people,
276320	277600	but you were not a fan.
277600	281500	It has a bunch of pop bullshit that I hate.
281500	288120	As in, when I went in the room and had to ask, what is this and who is that, then that's
288120	294760	a sign that it's stuff that I don't listen to.
294760	297600	You made me play Sing Star Abba today.
297600	299480	Yes, it was amazing.
299480	304200	The girls came over before tonight's show, and we sat down with some Sing Star Abba.
304200	306720	It was epic, as Abba would be.
306720	310480	Here's the thing about Dark Soccer, though, is that she does this whole, oh, I don't sing
310480	311480	in front of people.
311480	312480	I don't like to sing.
312480	313680	I don't really want to play.
313680	318320	So Tiara and I basically put a gun to her head and said, look, you're going to sing
318320	321520	or else, and she said, oh, okay.
321520	325720	She got up there and sang, got a higher score than Tiara and I. Probably combined, she got
325720	326720	a higher score.
326720	331480	I think she got 8,500 on the Take On Me song or something.
331480	332480	I don't know.
332480	339080	On her first song, she got 8,000 on whatever Abba song she was singing, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme.
339080	342920	She's totally one of those people that's like, oh, no, I couldn't possibly, and then she's
342920	345360	like, oh, my God, she's amazing.
345360	347360	No, it's okay.
347360	351520	This is the thing, and I'm sure I've explained this before, I hate hearing out of tune, and
351520	354720	I hear myself out of tune, and it drives me nuts.
354720	361160	And I think everyone else can hear it because I hear it, so I don't really want to do it.
361160	365320	And singing in front of people has been ruined for me forever because of church choir.
365320	366320	I see.
366320	371660	Well, so that explains then why we're shy, and at least you can change the mic volume
371660	372660	in SimStar.
372660	373660	Yeah, that was helpful.
373660	377720	It's just because I didn't want to hear myself that loud, but I played other stuff.
377720	382160	I actually turned on Order of Ecclesia and then turned it off because that was when Becky
382160	387180	arrived because I was just starting to play, and then it's like, oh, hi.
387180	393940	So we watched Eddie Izzard, and then we played a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance,
393940	397520	and by a whole crap ton, I mean a whole crap ton.
397520	405640	It was fantastic for, um, sorry, hee hee hee hee hee.
405640	408040	What the hell else did I play?
408040	413080	I gotta go to chat room because leave it to chat room to make some tee hee type comments.
413080	416680	Chat.orangeontrader.com, the ever-present extra guest on the program.
416680	422160	Black Wolf, our buddy, who is on right before us at allgames.com, and I should work in this
422160	423160	plug for him.
423160	425640	He's starting a new project next week on Friday.
425640	429000	It's Friday Night Gaming, FNG, that effing show.
429000	431880	Now I can actually call it that effing show, and he can't get mad at me.
431880	436420	It's FNG, fnglive.net, and he has a comment tonight.
436420	440280	He says, the game obviously didn't hear you sing out of tune, because that's right, you
440280	441280	got a high score.
441280	443960	Obviously you weren't out of tune because the game didn't grade you out of tune.
443960	444960	Just had to say that.
444960	447760	Well, yeah, okay, but it's...
447760	451160	It's probably forgiving, so she has another reason to be self-deprecating.
451160	452160	Thank you!
452160	454680	I want ice cream now.
454680	455680	Anyway.
455680	457880	Let's all go out for ice cream after the show.
457880	458880	Actually they brought ice cream.
458880	459880	Yeah.
459880	460880	Damn.
460880	464000	But, um, but, I, um, what else, what else the heck did I play?
464000	468800	Oh yeah, I was starting to play more Ragnarok, and then I was like, damn this intro's long!
468800	473360	So um, I'm still on the, uh, opening part of the game where they do a whole shit ton
473360	474920	of talking.
474920	478280	And um, um, um, um, I played something else.
478280	479600	Oh yeah!
479600	483080	Big Buck Safari.
483080	487120	We went- What?
487120	493720	We were waiting on our food at, um, the Beach Hut Deli that, um, well I don't wanna...
493720	494720	Well, they're great.
494720	498440	It's up on, on, uh, was it on Madison up there?
498440	499440	On Greenback?
499440	500440	Wherever?
500440	504720	Anyway, um, we were waiting on our food, and I was like, I wanna shoot an elephant!
504720	510400	So, cause it was the tropical one.
510400	516480	So I got up there, and, and, thank you for the 50 cents by the way, and um, I, there,
516480	521120	you couldn't shoot elephants to start, so I picked a wildebeest, and kept, you know,
521120	522320	wanting to shoot the wildebeests.
522320	526880	But they were stupid, and it's like, if you shoot, you can only shoot the buck, you can't
526880	527880	shoot the cow.
527880	531320	I said, you shot a cow, moo!
531320	534000	But I shot a lion in the ass.
534000	537960	I like nipped his ear, and he turned and ran, so I shot him in the ass.
537960	540160	And then I shot an elephant in the head.
540160	541160	Even though I wasn't supposed to shoot the elephant.
541160	542920	This is what Africa should be.
542920	544800	That's what I said!
544800	549400	I was like, this game is what Africa needs to be, only it was kinda craptastic, but it
549400	550400	was pretty funny.
550400	553800	And, you know, I just wanna remind people that all these Safari games we play, they're
553800	557360	all crap compared to Jambo Safari, honestly, when all's said and done.
557360	558360	Jambo Safari is great.
558360	562200	Yes, Jambo Safari is one of those amazing, great games that we'll never shut up about
562200	563640	here on Orange Lounge Radio.
563640	568440	Like file it under, like, Guardian Legend and SingStar Abba, because it's right up there.
568440	573720	And then, um, I, I, our Turbo Express is low on battery, and we need to do batteries for
573720	577360	it, but I really wanted to play R-Type on, uh, earlier in the week.
577360	585760	I didn't get to play R-Type, but, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh, but, I did get, I told you I got Katamari
585760	589960	for my iPhone, and I played some.
589960	593080	Is this fail-tastic, as a lot of people were saying, or did they really fix it?
593080	594520	I heard they fixed some stuff.
594520	597540	It's still kinda hard to control, I haven't done story mode yet, I've just been doing
597540	600720	endless to get used to the controls.
600720	605880	I don't like tilting it, I wish that I could just, you know, slide my thumb in one direction
605880	611360	and have the, the Katamari go that way, but, it's alright, it's not bad.
611360	614800	It actually, I can't really notice a lot of the framerate problems that people were talking
614800	620520	about, because the, um, first one kind of had a few of those on its own, so it really
620520	626160	isn't all that big of a deal, it's an iPhone app, deal with it, shit.
626160	632120	You know, you wanna play Katamari that doesn't have that problem, freakin' get a PS2.
632120	640760	Alright, I like that review, it's an iPhone app, shit, deal with it, alright.
640760	641760	Let's move on.
641760	643800	I'm gonna type that up right now.
643800	648280	You do that, put that in the Giggling Girl blog, alright, just kidding, alright, let's
648280	651540	move on over to Loki, Loki, how was your gaming week?
651540	658420	My gaming week was okay, um, I played a lot, well I tried playing some Grand Theft Auto
658420	665760	on PC, Grand Theft Auto IV, and for some reason, you know, I was trying to get some of the
665760	669880	mods to work in, it just doesn't like doing mods or something, even though I'm not really
669880	674120	changing much, it's just being retarded, so that's kind of annoying, but I did get, like,
674120	677720	some of the, um, no gravity stuff to work, but I was trying to do some really fun stuff
677720	680120	with it, but, oh well.
680120	688720	And then, um, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV on the 360 as well, still playing our, um,
688720	697280	daily games, and I actually tried some new XNA games, uh, one though I really liked was
697280	702680	uh, Carnivale, and I can't remember the rest of the title for that, but uh, Carnivale,
702680	709120	um, it's a really weird kind of game, you play like, Carnivale Showtime, yes, Carnivale
709120	718160	Showtime, it's, um, you play like this, um, acrobat, who's not really human, and you go
718160	726780	around popping balloons, but, they aren't really balloons, yes, sorry, never mind, except
726780	730520	they aren't really balloons, okay, um, no, but you actually, they have these little devices
730520	733920	that swing you around stuff, and the whole goal of it is to pop all the balloons and
733920	738480	get up to, um, the top of the screen where there's a flaming ring.
738480	742040	Now it sounds simple enough, but it keeps getting more and more progressively harder,
742040	747960	and there's other things that are added into it, like rockets and electrical stuff, um,
747960	752120	but for an XNA game it's actually extremely excellent, in fact, I think this thing sets
752120	758560	the bar as far as what XNA games should be, um, totally polished, it could easily be an
758560	765240	Xbox Live Arcade game, easily, um, so highly recommend you check it out, I went ahead and
765240	771360	purchased it cause it was awesome, so, check it out and buy it, cause it's good, and very
771360	773640	fun actually, and really colorful.
773640	777080	So for all those people out there that say you hate on community games, not true, cause
777080	778080	I love this one.
778080	781800	No, this is what I'm saying is, they need to be polished, it's cause a lot of the stuff
781800	787960	I see on there is not very polished, and that's my problem with it, you know, so you have
787960	791560	to look at games like this and go, oh my god, this is what they could be like, then what
791560	793560	the hell is everyone else doing?
793560	795400	That's my thing right there.
795400	798440	Vidpower in chat says, every time somebody talks about a carnival, I think about that
798440	802720	carnival arcade game, and you know, when you said carnival, I was thinking of that HBO
802720	806000	series, like, did they make a carnival video game?
806000	811000	No, it's not a carnival video game, no, it's really cool though, it's, um, easily something
811000	817600	though that could be an Xbox Live Arcade game, which it should be I think, but, whatever.
817600	825680	Um, and then other than that, I played a little bit of Dissidia, and a little bit of Animal
825680	829440	Crossing, and that's pretty much it.
829440	834920	I was gonna try to play some other things this week, but I didn't get around to it,
834920	836780	so that's okay.
836780	841840	My gaming week, you know, same old stuff, World of Warcraft, I've now done three wings
841840	848360	on 25-Man Naxx, thank you very much, because of our raiding alliance, but it was fun.
848360	851240	But here's the thing, other than that, you know what game I've actually been spending
851240	853800	like the majority of my game week playing?
853800	859960	Is Suikoden, yes, the old school PlayStation 1 game Suikoden, and why have I been playing
859960	860960	that of all games?
860960	864560	Well, they released it on the PlayStation 3, I think two weeks ago, I think Christmas
864560	868800	week as one of the backwards compatible games that you can play on your PlayStation 3 or
868800	869880	the PSP.
869880	874680	And it's kind of a hard to find game now, it was a collector's item for a little while,
874680	878720	I mean, now that it's on PlayStation 3, I'm not sure how that's gonna go, I'm sure the
878720	882720	hardcore collectors will still be after it, but those that want to play it now can do
882720	884560	so for $6.
884560	887960	So it's cool, because I remember playing the game once like a long time ago, I think I'd
887960	891880	rented it, but I didn't really remember it, and you know, one of my really good friends
891880	895680	has been on the show before, Shane, he always raves about Suikoden, and you know, I just
895680	898740	knew that a lot of people really liked the game, so I wanted to play it.
898740	904680	So yeah, I've been playing it, I've already dropped like almost six hours in it, and it's
904680	908400	fun and the story's a lot better than you'd think it is at the beginning when you realize
908400	914600	the graphics are kind of a step up from the Super Nintendo, but that Fortune Wheel boss,
914600	916800	for those of you who have played Suikoden, you'll know what I'm talking about, the Fortune
916800	921400	Wheel boss, seriously, that was the worst thing ever, ever.
921400	924520	But I got past it, but man did that take persistence.
924520	928360	Basically there's a boss, that's a giant roulette wheel, and you step onto it, and you land
928360	932520	on a square that might be a monster, or might be experience, but you're waiting to land
932520	935520	on the square that'll take you to the next room, but you might have to do the damn thing
935520	941440	like fifty times, I'm not even kidding, and do all these random videos, terrible.
941440	945000	But otherwise the game's pretty awesome actually, I really like the concept of going around
945000	948760	and recruiting people to join your army, because there should be an army of supporters that
948760	949880	I have.
949880	955000	Anyway, so that was pretty much my gaming week, it was a good classic, Suikoden.
955000	958120	Drew, how was your gaming week?
958120	960720	Pretty good, I had a cold for most of the week, better now though.
960720	963880	Me too, that's kind of ruined my week too.
963880	974200	I sat and played World of Warcraft, I'm actually a main tank now, one of the tanks for my guild.
974200	979800	I took advantage of the Steam sale that happened at the end of the year, picked up some games,
979800	986200	finally got Portal, finally played through Portal, I mean five bucks, come on, played
986200	993960	through Bioshock, got Team Fortress 2, played that a little bit, Enemy Territory Quake Wars,
993960	996560	and I'm just starting out on Fallout 3.
996560	1000120	So I've been a little busy gaming-wise, but it's all been good.
1000120	1003960	Now Fallout 3 has been one of those games that I want to play eventually, because I've
1003960	1006920	heard so many good things about it, I didn't play Oblivion until a few months after it
1006920	1010560	was out and I still loved it later, I'm just thinking of Bethesda games.
1010560	1014680	Is Fallout 3 seeming to be worthy of all the praise that's been lavished upon it by the
1014680	1016200	gaming masses?
1016200	1021600	I'll preface this with the fact that I hate Oblivion, but I like Fallout 3.
1021600	1024880	It's a damn good game.
1024880	1029960	It's a little tedious to walk this place and that until you get to fast travel back and
1029960	1036640	forth, but it's pretty good for a first-person style Fallout.
1036640	1041640	I kind of miss the holy turn-based thing, but V.A.T.S. takes care of that quite nicely.
1041640	1047120	All right, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
1047120	1048120	That's about it.
1048120	1049760	Well then let's move on over to Sauce.
1049760	1050760	Hello, Sauce.
1050760	1051760	Hello.
1051760	1052960	How was your gaming week?
1052960	1053960	It was good.
1053960	1058720	Earlier in the week I played a lot of Eternal Sonata, which was...
1058720	1063000	We're having mic issues, if you heard that, no I don't think it was you, I think it was...
1063000	1065840	One of these mics is like on the fritz, it's on its last legs.
1065840	1067400	It's the one I told Andrew to use.
1067400	1068400	Is it?
1068400	1072760	Yeah, I think that mic is going to go any day now, so sorry.
1072760	1075880	If you hear random things, sorry about that, live radio.
1075880	1076880	It sucks sometimes.
1076880	1077880	Go ahead, Sauce.
1077880	1080440	So I played Eternal Sonata, which is fun.
1080440	1081720	I had never...
1081720	1089440	I just got an Xbox 360 the day after Thanksgiving, so I'm kind of catching up on games that people
1089440	1093160	have already played before, and that was fun.
1093160	1098680	And then New Year's Eve we played a lot of Rock Band, or I saw Lips, which I thought
1098680	1102760	was pretty cool, because there's a lot of poppy music that Jamie hates, but I thought
1102760	1106080	it was great.
1106080	1111600	Let's see, we played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was fun.
1111600	1118440	I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith with Dan, which was also fun, I like that game.
1118440	1126440	And I wound up waking up like five hours before Jamie or Dan did on New Year's Day, so I wound
1126440	1130400	up trying out Fable 2, because I'd never played that, and I'm really addicted.
1130400	1134360	I've been waking up before everyone almost every day since I've been here, and I've been
1134360	1136400	playing that in the mornings.
1136400	1143480	And I accidentally killed my first husband, which was fun, oops, I forgot he was following
1143480	1147520	me and I went to go do a quest to kill bandits, and I accidentally got him killed.
1147520	1153680	So then I remarried, and then I moved into a nicer house, and then in the gypsy camp
1153680	1158880	I found a lesbian who was in love with me, so I married her also.
1158880	1166880	Yeah I got a bigamist achievement for that, so it was fun.
1166880	1169400	So yeah, that was pretty much my gaming wig.
1169400	1171880	I heard you named your baby Optimus Prime.
1171880	1177680	Yeah, I had a baby with my second husband and I named him Optimus Prime.
1177680	1179800	Awesome.
1179800	1183320	He likes tofu.
1183320	1185720	As any growing boy should.
1185720	1186720	Alright.
1186720	1196480	Wow, anyhow, let's get a move on talking about some podcast updates and the show.
1196480	1200960	There is no show next week, just a reminder, we will not be here live next week, January
1200960	1202680	11th.
1202680	1207380	That's because we're on vacation, I'll be out of the state and I think everybody else
1207380	1212120	just wants a week off after the holidays, so enjoy your night off from OLR.
1212120	1214260	We will be back however on the 18th.
1214260	1219800	Also, speaking of which, as far as the podcast feed goes, I know it's been behind and lagging,
1219800	1223920	but it's all caught up now, so go enjoy all the latest episodes of Orange Launch Radio.
1223920	1227180	You may have to dig back into iTunes a little bit, pick up all the shows you may have missed.
1227180	1231740	So everything is all caught up there and is hunky-dory in Podcast World.
1231740	1238260	So now let's get into tonight's news and stuff and we'll get into a game later on, which
1238260	1242180	some of our chatters can play and possibly win a fabulous prize.
1242180	1243180	We'll talk more about that later.
1243180	1246160	Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?
1246160	1249040	Alright, well guess what?
1249040	1254000	The Nielsen company has done a bunch of different polls and one of those polls that they have
1254000	1261180	tabulated was, what was the most played game console for 2008?
1261180	1266020	Well congratulations Sony, it was the PlayStation 2.
1266020	1271820	And that had 31.2% of the market share, which is not surprising because it still has the
1271820	1276280	largest market share of game consoles out there right now.
1276280	1284160	Number two was the Xbox 360 with 17.2%, followed by the Wii with 13.4%, which is interesting
1284160	1291920	because there are more Wii consoles out there than Xbox 360, followed by the original Xbox
1291920	1299520	with 9.7%, and then sadly after that, the PlayStation 3 with 7.3%.
1299520	1305160	Wait, so more people are playing the original Xbox than are playing the PlayStation 3?
1305160	1310000	That's right, the original Xbox, the system they stopped selling a couple years ago.
1310000	1313920	Ouch, that's too bad.
1313920	1317400	And then of course GameCube with 4.6%.
1317400	1322440	So hey, at least they're beating the GameCube.
1322440	1324760	I notice handhelds aren't ranked in there though.
1324760	1331280	Yeah, because they think they're talking about home console and, you know, I don't know,
1331280	1334360	they just didn't consider handhelds I guess.
1334360	1337480	Because if you talk about handhelds, they ain't got to do like, you know, the iPhone
1337480	1342280	maybe, and it's just, you know, we'll just ignore the handhelds.
1342280	1347560	Alright, well, do you think things might change in 2009?
1347560	1350520	Do you think at some point something's got to overtake the PlayStation 2 eventually?
1350520	1354640	I'm kind of surprised the Wii wasn't higher up there, I mean, I am and I'm not.
1354640	1357880	Obviously the Wii's biggest problem is that once the novelty of Wii Sports and all that
1357880	1362160	wears off, it kind of just sits there and gathers dust, but, you know, there's still
1362160	1366380	a lot of families, especially at Christmas time, that are all playing Wii Sports together
1366380	1368120	and stuff, you know?
1368120	1374480	But, you know, would you rather be, I mean, would people be playing Wii Sports for like
1374480	1375480	six hours a day?
1375480	1379960	I mean, there's some people, obviously they'll play more hardcore, like RPGs and stuff like
1379960	1385840	that, like Fallout, you know, and, you know, Fallout, they could be playing that for hours
1385840	1389920	at a time and that just kind of goes right by, but the Wii doesn't really have anything
1389920	1394240	that takes up tons of time, I mean, Animal Crossing, but hell, that gets boring after
1394240	1397440	a couple hours, so.
1397440	1401240	It's not really that big of a surprise.
1401240	1405640	I guess all those people that are playing Wii Fit, or not playing Wii Fit, or not playing
1405640	1409640	Wii Music, very funny.
1409640	1415720	Rob has escaped us.
1415720	1417640	Rob ran away while I was having network difficulties.
1417640	1422200	Sorry, live radio folks, I tried to go fix the network by plugging in the extender, which
1422200	1425680	I had unplugged earlier in the week because it was causing me issues of the PlayStation
1425680	1426680	3.
1426680	1432360	Boy, 2009, not off to a good start in regards to the technical difficulties, is it?
1432360	1434760	We have mic issues and network issues.
1434760	1435760	Good lord.
1435760	1441560	Hey, but one thing that's not having issues, it's growing and growing is XNA and the community
1441560	1443240	games on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1443240	1446240	What are you laughing about over there, Saws?
1446240	1449040	My lame transitions, or what?
1449040	1450040	Okay.
1450040	1451040	Anyhow.
1451040	1456040	Hey, obviously there are just tons and tons and tons of games on the community games list,
1456040	1459320	and it's kind of hard to figure out, like, what is good and out there to download.
1459320	1462840	I mean, you know, obviously there's a lot of good stuff out there, but there's some
1462840	1467920	also not good stuff out there, so trying to be able to sort it all can be a challenge.
1467920	1473680	Well, this website, gamerbytes.com, actually decided to put together their top 10 XNA community
1473680	1476760	games of 2008.
1476760	1478520	It's from gamerbytes.com.
1478520	1484880	They say, Galax email, Monaco 360, which looks a little bit like Rally-X to me, I don't know
1484880	1485880	about that.
1485880	1486880	It's a remake of Monaco.
1486880	1490400	Oh, it's a remake of Monaco GP, okay.
1490400	1498160	Cave-In was eight, Star Pilot was seven, Weapon of Choice was six, Hexothermic was five, Duotrix
1498160	1501440	was four, Johnny Platform's Biscuit Romp was three.
1501440	1503600	I almost downloaded that today.
1503600	1504600	Biscuit Romp?
1504600	1505600	That sounds kind of awesome.
1505600	1506600	That sounds kind of dirty.
1506600	1508400	Ultratron was number two.
1508400	1512800	Which looks like a complete rip-off of Robotron, by the way, but still looks pretty.
1512800	1517160	And number one was the game that Loki was earlier talking about, Carnivale Showtime,
1517160	1520120	which must be part of the inspiration for him to download it, maybe?
1520120	1521120	Yes, it would be.
1521120	1522120	Ah.
1522120	1523120	So...
1523120	1525480	I didn't even know it was on there, because I usually check, you know, quite a bit for
1525480	1529780	different games, but it must have been something that's just recently added.
1529780	1534200	How sad, though, that our buddy Aaron in his game Snake 360 did not make the list, but
1534200	1535200	maybe next year.
1535200	1536320	He must have been number 11.
1536320	1537400	I don't know.
1537400	1538400	Maybe next year.
1538400	1542560	It's unfortunate, because there's probably so many games out there right now, and there's
1542560	1543560	nothing really to...
1543560	1547760	I mean, you can look at the top downloads and stuff like that, but that's kind of skewed
1547760	1548760	sometimes.
1548760	1549760	Yeah?
1549760	1550760	I don't know.
1550760	1551760	Yeah, it can be.
1551760	1557060	I wonder if anybody's figured out a way to kind of, like, stack the deck.
1557060	1558060	You know what I mean?
1558060	1561280	Nobody's figured out a way to cheat that system yet, or anything like that.
1561280	1564300	Download the trial a bunch of times, I don't know.
1564300	1567040	Do you think it would require unique accounts, or what?
1567040	1568040	Maybe.
1568040	1569040	I don't know.
1569040	1573920	But, Jamie, that one game, the Biscuit Challenge, or whatever, that's only at 200 Microsoft
1573920	1575600	points to download.
1575600	1577680	Looks kind of like a neat little platformer game.
1577680	1580520	Maybe I'll have to invest and challenge the Biscuit.
1580520	1582520	You hear that, fireplace sim?
1582520	1584520	200 Microsoft points.
1584520	1585880	Don't need to be 500.
1585880	1589520	That's ridiculous for stupid, fake-looking fire.
1589520	1590520	Alright.
1590520	1594160	Well, I'll have to check some of these out.
1594160	1597560	I've been falling behind on the community games, and I keep meaning to stay on top of
1597560	1598560	them, but...
1598560	1599560	Seriously, Carnevale.
1599560	1600560	That's awesome.
1600560	1601560	Alright.
1601560	1602560	I'll definitely make it a point to check that one out.
1602560	1605880	I even bought a bigger hard drive so I could download more games, so I swear I will at
1605880	1606880	some point.
1606880	1607880	They actually had some pretty cool stuff.
1607880	1611360	They had a music-making program on there now, which is kind of neat.
1611360	1612360	Hmm.
1612360	1613360	I'll have to check that out.
1613360	1616320	Well, how about some other top 10s?
1616320	1623320	And this is Eurogamer's top 10 games, so we're looking a little bit to the overseas opinion.
1623320	1629480	But number 10 was World of Goo, which is We Wear in PC, and it's actually something that
1629480	1635200	I was really interested in, just because it looks so bizarre.
1635200	1642200	Another, the next one is Guitar Hero World Tour for 9th place.
1642200	1646320	And I have to use your slow internet to get to the next one.
1646320	1647320	Really?
1647320	1651560	There was a lot of people hating on Guitar Hero World Tour when I talked to them.
1651560	1652560	So interesting.
1652560	1653560	But this is Europe.
1653560	1655960	I know, but still, it's not like it's a completely different game.
1655960	1657560	It's interesting.
1657560	1662900	Number 8 was Gears of War 2 for Xbox 360.
1662900	1665120	It was pretty epic.
1665120	1672360	7, Left 4 Dead, which is Valve's zombie game.
1672360	1676360	I've definitely seen both of those on a lot of top 10 lists this year, that's for sure.
1676360	1677360	Zombies!
1677360	1682800	6 is Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, a pretty shiny game.
1682800	1686640	That game was pretty awesome and was sadly neglected from a lot of top 10 lists this
1686640	1687640	year.
1687640	1689680	That was a pretty awesome game.
1689680	1695160	5 is Braid from Xbox Live Arcade.
1695160	1699080	And then, moving forward, I'm surprised it's only at 5.
1699080	1702240	Number 4 is Fable 2.
1702240	1704240	Fable 2 is very, very British.
1704240	1707680	I mean, because it's the spelling and everything.
1707680	1708680	But anyway.
1708680	1710400	3, Grand Theft Auto 4.
1710400	1714100	You all knew it would be up there.
1714100	1716520	Moving on to number 2.
1716520	1721440	Number 2 is Fallout 3, which is pretty darn awesome.
1721440	1724320	And number 1 is LittleBigPlanet.
1724320	1730360	Excellent choice for LittleBigPlanet, but I didn't hear Rock Band 2.
1730360	1734040	So they put Guitar Hero World Tour on this list, but they didn't put Rock Band 2 on there?
1734040	1735040	That's interesting.
1735040	1737560	Or did Rock Band 2 not get released over there yet?
1737560	1738560	I don't even know.
1738560	1740000	Because, you know, the delays and everything.
1740000	1741480	I thought they got it.
1741480	1744800	I thought they didn't have nearly the delay we had over here.
1744800	1745800	Very interesting.
1745800	1746800	Hmm.
1746800	1750360	Maybe they were feeling, or, you know, this is just one particular website, obviously.
1750360	1752040	It's not the whole country's opinion.
1752040	1756320	But maybe this particular website was, you know, maybe put off by the fact that it felt
1756320	1758520	like more of an upgrade to the previous Rock Band game.
1758520	1759520	Don't know.
1759520	1765880	There was a story, kind of tied in with this too, that Peter Moore was pissed off at EA
1765880	1769200	because FIFA didn't make the list.
1769200	1770520	How so?
1770520	1775680	Because it's a European game, and FIFA soccer always usually is one of those bigger games.
1775680	1777720	And so he was pissed off that it didn't make the list.
1777720	1781040	Actually, there was a Top 50 list that they did too, I think.
1781040	1787120	They had like Mirror's Edge and stuff like that on there, but FIFA's not on the list.
1787120	1788120	Ouch.
1788120	1789120	So bad.
1789120	1790120	Interesting.
1790120	1791120	Or too bad, so sad.
1791120	1792120	Yeah.
1792120	1793360	Well, maybe that's just a hint to, you know, do...
1793360	1794360	I don't know.
1794360	1797080	I didn't play the game, so I don't know if it's good or not, but, you know, I would...
1797080	1799520	Maybe it's just a hint to do better next time?
1799520	1801080	I don't know.
1801080	1802080	Maybe.
1802080	1808880	The PS3 may not have led as far as console game playing share, but they are leading in
1808880	1812360	one thing, and that is web browsing.
1812360	1817020	Between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii, PlayStation 3 has won.
1817020	1820560	They actually have quite a few people browsing.
1820560	1830920	Of course, when you compare all the browsing platforms, including PC and stuff, 0.4% of
1830920	1840000	all web browsing is done on the PS3, compared to the 0.01% that's done on the Wii, so yay!
1840000	1844400	Go 0.3% or 0.3% better.
1844400	1845400	Yeah.
1845400	1848720	What do people actually browse the web for on their TV?
1848720	1852000	I mean, I can't imagine like checking my email on the TV and stuff.
1852000	1853000	That would just be terrible.
1853000	1855560	YouTube and Pornotube, that's pretty much it.
1855560	1856560	Exactly what I was gonna say.
1856560	1859920	YouTube and XTube are pretty much all I can think of, and I will say this.
1859920	1864640	I actually, you know, believe it or not, I had not seen that whole jizz in my pants thing
1864640	1869680	from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago that had become a viral video.
1869680	1873360	So my friend finally made me go on YouTube and watch it, and I did it on the PlayStation
1873360	1878080	3, and it was much smoother than when I had tried to use YouTube on the Wii before.
1878080	1880440	So I will say it was superior YouTube on the PS3.
1880440	1885240	Because they have Flash 9 built into the PlayStation 3 browser, whereas the Wii only has Flash
1885240	1886240	7.
1886240	1887240	Oh, okay.
1887240	1892920	Because certain people that, you know, develop the Wii don't give a shit about online.
1892920	1895880	I see, I see.
1895880	1899540	And then I saw the jizz in my pants thing, and it wasn't as funny as they made it out
1899540	1901600	to be, I have to say.
1901600	1903160	But it was still kind of funny.
1903160	1908440	Anyway, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, Google it or something.
1908440	1909440	Oh.
1909440	1910440	What?
1910440	1917040	Totally unrelated, but they have a new Charlie the Unicorn that they did for YouTube Live.
1917040	1918320	It's hilarious.
1918320	1919320	It's short, though.
1919320	1920640	Like a third one?
1920640	1921640	Yeah, sort of.
1921640	1924440	It's like a little short thing that they did during YouTube Live.
1924440	1927400	And they had Rick Ashley in there.
1927400	1928400	Interesting.
1928400	1930920	And they were talking in Russian.
1930920	1931920	Hmm.
1931920	1935440	Well, we've been keeping our eye on the game blogs this week, and one thing that caught
1935440	1940480	our eye on one of the game blogs was this story on Joystiq about a study that buff game
1940480	1943520	characters apparently give men a negative body image.
1943520	1944980	And you know, this is interesting.
1944980	1949720	You know why this is interesting, because we hear all the freaking time about women
1949720	1955520	and the supermodels and the wafer-thin looks and women just want to be beautiful and all
1955520	1960120	this crap because Hollywood screws up everybody's perception of what's normal and da-da-da.
1960120	1963220	But you don't hear it a lot about men.
1963220	1968080	So that's what I thought was very interesting about this story is that it kind of calls
1968080	1972400	attention to, well, maybe there's guys that get image problems as well.
1972400	1977120	And apparently, they're quoting a study from researchers at Kansas State University.
1977120	1982200	And apparently what the study showed is that if you view extreme body images in games,
1982200	1985080	I don't know what that means, extreme body images in games.
1985080	1993960	Like, is there, like, plus I wouldn't think, like, you know, muscular men extreme cells,
1993960	1994960	but you know, maybe...
1994960	1996920	Depends what market you're marketing men for.
1996920	1997920	Exactly.
1997920	2002720	It's gonna sell 10%, you know, or it's gonna sell the, you know, women or whatever, but
2002720	2004920	anyway, I don't know.
2004920	2009440	Anyhow, but they say 15 minutes of seeing these extreme body images.
2009440	2013760	It's enough to give both males and females, so it's not just, you know, no, here we go
2013760	2017600	with women again, sadly, unfortunately having to look at this in the media, giving them
2017600	2019560	a negative impression of their own body image.
2019560	2020800	Oh, that's bullshit.
2020800	2021800	I'm sorry.
2021800	2022800	You think it's all bullshit?
2022800	2023800	That is bullshit.
2023800	2028800	I'm playing games with, you know, muscular main characters all the time.
2028800	2030420	Doesn't mean I want to go work out.
2030420	2031420	Fuck that.
2031420	2032420	I'm playing a game.
2032420	2033420	It's a fictional character.
2033420	2034420	What the hell do I care?
2034420	2037480	Well, if you want to know a little more about this, you can actually go to where the study's
2037480	2040740	actually at, which is on some television station's local website.
2040740	2044520	And apparently it was put together by a graduate student who organized two study groups of
2044520	2045520	university students.
2045520	2050320	Okay, here's the extreme game they were talking about, WWF WrestleMania 2000.
2050320	2054840	That's an N64 game.
2054840	2057040	The hell?
2057040	2063000	Well perhaps, I don't know, perhaps the, wow, the news station must be really short over
2063000	2064000	there.
2064000	2067120	Perhaps the news station must have butchered something, I don't know.
2067120	2069920	This is Kansas, after all.
2069920	2075180	And apparently, you know, I love this quote from the news article, included enormous muscular
2075180	2081200	specimens such as The Rock, Big Boss Man, and The Undertaker.
2081200	2082200	Wrestling or gay porn?
2082200	2083200	You be the judge.
2083200	2084200	Seriously.
2084200	2090040	Like, I don't watch a lot of wrestling, but damn, Big Boss Man, like, I think I saw him
2090040	2091620	at Folsom Street Fair.
2091620	2093120	Big Boss Man was awesome.
2093120	2096240	I'm just saying.
2096240	2100560	By the way, the second study was women and they had to play a beach volleyball game.
2100560	2104080	Well, that's probably DOA beach volleyball right there.
2104080	2111640	I mean, Boa, and then the story goes on to say, both male and female subjects viewed
2111640	2115760	their own bodies more negatively after completing a cycle at the game control.
2115760	2119540	He said the immediacy of reaction by game players was disturbing because video games
2119540	2121760	are such a powerful element of popular culture.
2121760	2126400	But here's the weird thing is that they were playing, like, sports video games.
2126400	2127400	It's stupid.
2127400	2132120	To me, they probably, it's totally skewed as far as what they ask the questions and
2132120	2133120	stuff.
2133120	2134600	Do you look as good as this character?
2134600	2139320	Well, fuck no I don't because I'm not, you know, a fictional character that can, you
2139320	2144240	know, for example, like women and stuff, this character, obviously the physics of her body
2144240	2145960	don't exist in the real world.
2145960	2148080	It's like, come on!
2148080	2149080	It's retarded.
2149080	2150720	Absolutely retarded.
2150720	2157040	And I don't think there's anyone that goes and plays a game of, like, I don't know, Conan
2157040	2162280	or something like that and then goes and cries because their body is, like, you know, pathetic
2162280	2163280	compared to that.
2163280	2166480	Well, you know, I don't want to look like some of these, you know, big guys because
2166480	2168800	I don't want to be addicted to steroids and crack.
2168800	2172440	Although I do have to say, though, playing games with lots of guns makes me want to own
2172440	2173440	guns.
2173440	2176640	So there is, you know, that correlation.
2176640	2180480	I wouldn't say that because there's a lot of people out there that are going to use
2180480	2183600	that, you know, like, oh, it just incites violence.
2183600	2188560	See this guy on this radio show says now he wants a gun because he plays games with guns.
2188560	2189560	So he's going to go shoot.
2189560	2190560	I bought another one, actually.
2190560	2191560	Oh my god.
2191560	2192560	Yeah.
2192560	2193560	G36C.
2193560	2196560	So now I've got that to go along with my shotgun and my P90.
2196560	2197560	Wow.
2197560	2198560	Yeah.
2198560	2200880	Oh, and my high kappa 51.
2200880	2201880	Wow.
2201880	2204560	It's a hobby that I really shouldn't be getting into.
2204560	2205560	All right.
2205560	2206560	Let's see.
2206560	2209280	I'm reading some comments from chatroom message.
2209280	2212480	J100Matt says, did the N64 just get released in Kansas?
2212480	2213480	Apparently.
2213480	2214480	I don't know.
2214480	2216560	This story had to have butchered something.
2216560	2217560	Kazowm.
2217560	2221040	I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.
2221040	2225200	Kazowm says, I bet every woman wishes they could jiggle their boobs like that.
2225200	2228000	Probably a referencing dead or alive.
2228000	2229540	I would think that would hurt.
2229540	2233400	You know, I've never had boobs and I don't really want to, but I would think that if
2233400	2237840	you jiggle them a lot, like it would really start to hurt because if I were to try and
2237840	2246920	jiggle my balls, that would probably hurt after a little while.
2246920	2248840	Does it hurt if you run naked?
2248840	2252880	No, it feels quite free.
2252880	2255560	Well, I don't know.
2255560	2256560	Let me try.
2256560	2257560	Wow.
2257560	2261200	They were playing the old game.
2261200	2264840	I thought it might have been a mistype or something like that, but it's actually WWF.
2264840	2268280	I mean, WWF hasn't been around for a while now.
2268280	2269280	I know.
2269280	2270280	I know.
2270280	2271280	This is amazing reporting done.
2271280	2275060	Yeah, but if you've played one of those wrestling games, you've played them all, they're all
2275060	2276680	pretty much exactly the same.
2276680	2281920	So that's probably all they could afford with our dying economy in Kansas.
2281920	2284440	In between the ramen.
2284440	2285440	And all that.
2285440	2286440	Nice.
2286440	2289720	Seriously, just rent a game.
2289720	2290720	I mean, god.
2290720	2294160	It's like, this is 64, what is this?
2294160	2297200	I don't remember that.
2297200	2298200	Alright.
2298200	2299200	Anyhow.
2299200	2300200	Sorry.
2300200	2309560	Bresloll is in chat, a co-host of Saturday Night's Understation Live here on All Games.
2309560	2312040	He's screaming, Photoshop robs balls.
2312040	2314200	Why would you want to do that?
2314200	2315200	Why?
2315200	2317160	Why would you even suggest that people do that?
2317160	2321720	Unless you're talking about playing pool and billiard balls.
2321720	2322720	That's okay.
2322720	2324720	Or beach balls.
2324720	2327680	Maybe I'm going on a trip to the beach, I need a beach ball.
2327680	2331400	Or I'm at Walmart and I'm standing in front of one of those big cages full of balls and
2331400	2336640	I'm trying to undo the thing at the bottom so that they all roll out onto the floor.
2336640	2338480	That's okay.
2338480	2341400	But whatever you're suggesting is not okay.
2341400	2343280	Because we all know billiards is gay.
2343280	2344280	Anyhow.
2344280	2345280	Shoutout.
2345280	2346820	You have to like knocking around some balls.
2346820	2349640	Who doesn't like to knock around some balls once in a while?
2349640	2350640	Hey!
2350640	2351640	Let's move on with some gaming news.
2351640	2359360	Well, for those of us who are Xbox owners and are really enjoying the whole, you know,
2359360	2365440	Avatar thingy that's going around, there's some new accessories to be coming out.
2365440	2367520	Actually different Avatar clothing.
2367520	2371080	Your phone talks funny!
2371080	2373120	Sorry, I'm yelling at Sauce.
2373120	2375160	Her phone just went off in the studio.
2375160	2380320	Well, there's basically a rave pack that's going to be coming out.
2380320	2386460	For the boys, there's a pixel art hoodie, a rave baseball cap, pink sweatbands, green
2386460	2389440	skinny fit jeans, and dark purple jeans.
2389440	2392520	I'm sure that you can't use that for the girls.
2392520	2397360	For the girls, there's a green chunky ring, a red chunky ring, yellow fingerless gloves,
2397360	2403560	blue fingerless gloves, chunky beaded bracelet, dayglo zebra print pumps, and a rave baseball
2403560	2409560	cap and none of that sound.
2409560	2418840	Now you can have your very own rave on your Xbox!
2418840	2423320	The boys' stuff sounds better.
2423320	2430440	Fuck a bunch of that.
2430440	2431440	Let's see.
2431440	2433600	So which one of those clothing items gives me the ecstasy?
2433600	2437600	I know, Leo Shannon Chat says, I want to know when the ecstasy pills are going to come with
2437600	2438600	the clothes.
2438600	2440720	That's the pixel art hoodie.
2440720	2445560	Kazaam in chat, I was going to say Kazaam because there's too many vowels, says you
2445560	2449080	can't actually make them not look gay.
2449080	2453480	I'm not sure if I should take offense to that or not, but whatever, it was funny.
2453480	2454480	Alright.
2454480	2458920	Yeah, I mean, seriously, there's a clear difference between gay and rave.
2458920	2461840	Well, at a rave, everyone's kind of gay.
2461840	2465640	I don't know if you've ever actually been to a rave, but like, come on.
2465640	2468120	A cuddle room, Loki.
2468120	2472160	A lot of raves have a cuddle room, where everybody, you know what they do?
2472160	2473560	They cuddle.
2473560	2474560	All night.
2474560	2475560	That's kind of gay.
2475560	2477560	Well, yeah, several of your parties have a cuddle room.
2477560	2481000	They want to grow, but I'm gay, so it's understandable.
2481000	2488040	Yeah, they want to group the easy chicks, and they're all high on ecstasy, so...
2488040	2489040	Why not?
2489040	2490040	Alright.
2490040	2491040	I know.
2491040	2495040	Everybody's happy when they're on ecstasy.
2495040	2500560	Alright, let's move on with some more news, please, before we get letters from angry parents.
2500560	2505600	Square Enix is bringing their next epic game to Xbox Live Arcade.
2505600	2509120	Will it feature Cloud or possibly any other Final Fantasy characters?
2509120	2512640	No, because it's not an epic game, and it's a puzzle game instead.
2512640	2517160	It's Yossaman Live will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2517160	2520560	The game kind of looks a little bit like Bejeweled, except you're supposed to be making triangles
2520560	2522640	out of the characters.
2522640	2526680	And it looks like everything has frowny faces on it.
2526680	2530640	So it's one very unhappy puzzle game.
2530640	2534240	Except all the other creatures under the sea here, it looks like they have smiley faces.
2534240	2536640	Why does everything have to have faces is what I want to know.
2536640	2537640	What do you do?
2537640	2539840	Is the part of the puzzle putting faces together or something?
2539840	2542960	No, you actually create triangles.
2542960	2547480	It's like instead of making four in a row, it's making a triangle.
2547480	2551960	If everything didn't have faces, you wouldn't want to punch it.
2551960	2552960	Good point.
2552960	2553960	Good point.
2553960	2558160	You know, I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious because the smile on the block is better than
2558160	2562880	mine, and I might have to go see a counselor because of that, because I'm having issues.
2562880	2567560	Body image issues from Yossaman Live.
2567560	2569540	I want my hair to be as spiky as Cloud's.
2569540	2572600	I'm having issues.
2572600	2578480	But apparently they're going to have this game come out also on the PlayStation Network
2578480	2580160	at some point as well.
2580160	2585600	But right now it's been confirmed for Xbox Live Arcade because there's a shot that shows
2585600	2588280	achievements.
2588280	2590960	So that's their hypothesis, I guess.
2590960	2595040	I'm sorry, here's the comment of 2009 in our chat room right now, and I can say that because
2595040	2596960	we're only, what, like four days into 2009?
2596960	2600520	SSJ100Matt says, the cuddle room is like the champagne room.
2600520	2602760	There's no sex going on.
2602760	2603760	Funny.
2603760	2604760	Alright.
2604760	2613400	Anyhow, hey, Lips download content, Lips, because, you know, Dark Sakura wants to download
2613400	2618040	more songs for Lips, but actually these songs, wait, these songs might actually get her into
2618040	2619840	it because these are pretty cool songs.
2619840	2625800	Where Did Our Love Go by The Supremes, Be Good Johnny by Men at Work, and Let's Groove
2625800	2627720	by Earth Wind and Fire.
2627720	2628720	No.
2628720	2630320	Okay, failed.
2630320	2634400	Well hey, if you want to download the songs and try it for yourself, they're between 160
2634400	2639040	and 180 Microsoft points apiece because I guess they have variable prices in Lips.
2639040	2640040	I didn't know that.
2640040	2641040	I don't have Lips.
2641040	2642040	It's the one karaoke game I don't have yet.
2642040	2646080	It came a little late to the party, pun intended, and I've already dumped a bunch of money on
2646080	2649840	SingStar, but I imagine someday I'll probably have to pick it up.
2649840	2653520	There's going to have to be a really good song that comes on download that I just can't
2653520	2654520	get on SingStar.
2654520	2655820	Well, here's what you can do.
2655820	2660500	You can import any other song that you want since you can import any MP3 into it.
2660500	2663880	But I would imagine, I haven't seen it in action yet, but I would imagine that stuff
2663880	2665200	works kind of wonky.
2665200	2666760	Yes, and here's what I want to see.
2666760	2673080	I want to see someone import in Max 300 or something like that and see how that works.
2673080	2674480	Because that would be funny.
2674480	2676360	There are no lyrics to Max 300.
2676360	2678640	That's why it's funny.
2678640	2679640	That's the whole point.
2679640	2682080	That's the only song that Matt would sing in karaoke anymore.
2682080	2683520	No, I wouldn't sing it at all.
2683520	2685160	I'd just be curious to see how it works.
2685160	2689600	Seriously, like Orange Lounge Radio, if nothing else, this show has accomplished single-handedly
2689600	2694160	destroying karaoke for Loki, and he'll never sing it again.
2694160	2698200	Can't really destroy something that wasn't ever really built up in the first place.
2698200	2699200	I see.
2699200	2702920	All right, anyhow, check it out if you want.
2702920	2715900	Well, there is a reward, I should say, or maybe a gift, but there is an Xbox 360 military
2715900	2718320	appreciation bundle.
2718320	2720080	I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
2720080	2723040	It's an appreciation bundle.
2723040	2724040	A what?
2724040	2725040	Appreciation bundle.
2725040	2726040	A typo on the damn page.
2726040	2727040	Oh.
2727040	2728040	No, it's a typo on the damn box.
2728040	2729040	Oh.
2729040	2733360	Oh my god, it is a typo on the box.
2733360	2734360	Wow.
2734360	2738080	But you want to know what's even more hilarious about this?
2738080	2739540	Sorry, go ahead.
2739540	2749420	First of all, first of all, it's $299.95, and it's the pack that comes with Lego Indiana
2749420	2758240	Jones and Kung Fu Panda, but they also sold this at Best Buy for the same price.
2758240	2760400	But they include Blue Dragon now.
2760400	2765080	No, the one we bought was the same thing.
2765080	2768680	So they're basically unloading all their excess copies of Blue Dragon that didn't sell?
2768680	2769680	I don't know.
2769680	2771720	Well, no, there's no Blue Dragon in this pack.
2771720	2775420	This is the same one that Best Buy was selling for Christmas.
2775420	2779040	I'm looking at the dog tag in the corner, and sure enough, military appreciation.
2779040	2783160	Oh yeah, sorry, Blue Dragon is included with that one, sorry.
2783160	2784160	It was really tiny.
2784160	2786160	There you have it.
2786160	2787720	But still.
2787720	2790400	But what exactly, where does the money go to?
2790400	2793140	To appreciate them.
2793140	2798440	Is it going to a charity, or are they selling this in a particular area of Texas?
2798440	2800160	They're selling it on the military bases.
2800160	2803920	Yeah, it was the PX.
2803920	2805700	So it's a cheap marketing thing and nothing more.
2805700	2809480	It's no donation to a military society or a veteran's fund.
2809480	2810480	We want money.
2810480	2812600	Here, you're bored.
2812600	2813600	The end.
2813600	2814600	Interesting.
2814600	2815600	Yep.
2815600	2821260	It's not only do you get the Xbox 360 with three games, but you get another free game
2821260	2823100	that's worth 20 bucks.
2823100	2824100	If that.
2824100	2829680	Yes, but you don't pay any taxes on base, military personnel don't, so that's another
2829680	2835160	added incentive to buy it on base rather than off base, and if that's the cheapest one,
2835160	2836160	then why not?
2836160	2841480	I guess that's a good point, because tax can really add up on some of those multi-hundred
2841480	2842480	dollar purchases.
2842480	2844480	Good point.
2844480	2852420	Well, if you want to use your Xbox 360 over wireless internet, there aren't really that
2852420	2854800	many ways to do it.
2854800	2860640	Of course, the Microsoft route would be paying $99.99 for their wireless gaming receiver.
2860640	2864560	However, there are cheaper ways to do it, though.
2864560	2870840	One new way that's been pointed out by Popular Science is that you can actually download
2870840	2877240	a freeware program to use an outdated wireless router and use that as a wireless gaming receiver
2877240	2879000	as well.
2879000	2883800	And of course, that'll cost you whatever you can find for a cheap router for.
2883800	2891000	Or as I've been reading as well, you can actually use the original Xbox wireless gaming receiver,
2891000	2893760	which is under 50 bucks.
2893760	2894940	Interesting.
2894940	2899200	Or pretty much any wireless gaming receiver out there that's probably cheaper than $99.99.
2899200	2902560	Yeah, I paid $99.99 for my little wireless gaming receiver.
2902560	2905840	It's not an official Xbox one, but it's like a third party one that will also work with
2905840	2909040	my PS2, which is why I bought it.
2909040	2912320	But man, that was 100 bucks, just so I can use it.
2912320	2917080	One reason, one thing I will give props to the PlayStation 3 for, as hard of a time as
2917080	2919880	I've given that system in the past, I didn't have to set anything up.
2919880	2922720	Well, yeah, I had to go through a setup, but there was no wireless thing.
2922720	2927160	It has built-in wireless on it, like they all should.
2927160	2928160	Mine doesn't.
2928160	2929160	Really?
2929160	2931160	It's a 20 gig.
2931160	2932840	Oh, that's right.
2932840	2933840	I forgot they didn't all have that.
2933840	2938600	They also don't have the fancy memory card ports for, you know, pictures.
2938600	2939600	I don't think mine has that either.
2939600	2940600	I don't remember.
2940600	2941600	You don't either.
2941600	2942600	Yeah.
2942600	2943600	What do you use them for?
2943600	2944600	All right, anyhow, sorry.
2944600	2946920	I just thought I'd bring that up.
2946920	2953600	Anyhow, you know, a lot of us have those Xbox 360 HD drives, and we're not really using
2953600	2954600	them anymore.
2954600	2957120	I don't know about you guys, but I actually unplugged mine, because I have maybe like
2957120	2958120	seven movies.
2958120	2959120	I'm broke.
2959120	2960120	I don't even really watch them.
2960120	2961120	Yours broke?
2961120	2962120	Yeah.
2962120	2963120	Oh my gosh, what happened to it?
2963120	2965120	It does some...
2965120	2969480	I wasn't there when it happened, but it's doing some sort of error thing that we can't
2969480	2976760	watch our movies on there, and a particular certain person that I married hasn't bothered
2976760	2978520	calling to get it replaced, so.
2978520	2982680	Well, if you really want a new one, I mean, they're only like 20 bucks at Fry's right
2982680	2983680	now, I think.
2983680	2986120	They went so far down in price.
2986120	2987120	I don't know.
2987120	2991040	Well, here's the thing, though, is that actually I guess what you can do...
2991040	2998160	I don't know if this is just the HD DVD player, or if you do this with the actual Xbox 360.
2998160	3000680	No, it's the HD DVD player.
3000680	3001680	Okay.
3001680	3006200	Basically, you break it apart, and you can take the blue diode out of it, and you hook
3006200	3007200	it up.
3007200	3012360	They showed it basically hooked up to a laser sight on a gun, but pretty much anything that
3012360	3014280	has a laser emitting diode.
3014280	3016640	You can make your own burning laser out of it.
3016640	3017640	Yes.
3017640	3019200	Like a shark with a freaking laser beam on its head.
3019200	3020200	You can actually make your own.
3020200	3021200	Shark not included.
3021200	3026480	Yeah, basically, you take the diode out, and you build this really small chip that goes
3026480	3032480	with it, and you hook that up, and voila, a burning laser that can pop balloons and
3032480	3033480	burn paper.
3033480	3034480	Can it melt faces?
3034480	3036440	If it can't melt faces, it's worthless.
3036440	3040960	It might hurt if you leave it on someone's face for a while, but I don't know if it can
3040960	3041960	melt faces.
3041960	3042960	Ow, ow, that hurts.
3042960	3043960	Get that dot off my head.
3043960	3044960	Ow, ow, ow.
3044960	3050160	Just as a disclaimer, please do not try a LASIK surgery at home by yourself using your
3050160	3052120	HD DVD drive.
3052120	3054760	Orange Lounge Radio does not endorse you actually doing this.
3054760	3059920	It's just kind of cool that you can make a face-melting laser out of your Xbox 360.
3059920	3063920	And if you don't want to break apart your HD DVD drive because of the single-melting
3063920	3067920	value or anything like that, you can either buy your own burning laser, or you can buy
3067920	3071320	a laser diode for 50 bucks.
3071320	3074840	Shahranden Chat says, laser cats can be a reality.
3074840	3076800	I would not give this to my cat.
3076800	3079080	Take it to her head.
3079080	3085320	I would come home and it would look like a BB gun army ran through my house.
3085320	3089920	The house would be on fire, for real.
3089920	3091360	Do not give this to a cat.
3091360	3095280	If you give this to a cat, you're beyond an idiot.
3095280	3101880	They're staring at the birds outside and saw, boof.
3101880	3104060	Ah, yes.
3104060	3105940	All sorts of awesome.
3105940	3109320	You come home and the fish tank's boiling.
3109320	3112800	I don't think that happened, but yeah.
3112800	3113800	Something to that effect.
3113800	3119360	The fish would be dead, her food would be toasty, the birds would be on the ground missing
3119360	3120360	feathers.
3120360	3123400	Pew, pew, pew, mew, mew, mew.
3123400	3129500	Sorry, can I look at this video really quick that was posted of somebody actually using
3129500	3130500	the laser gun?
3130500	3131500	I'm looking at it here.
3131500	3132500	I don't know if there's any...
3132500	3133500	Oh, there's no sound here.
3133500	3134500	Yeah, he's basically just...
3134500	3139060	James Bond's weapon of choice, the Walter PPK.
3139060	3144480	We're not going to use the real gun, but a high performance semi-automatic CO2 version.
3144480	3149800	To make it burn, we need an Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.
3149800	3150800	Let's take a...
3150800	3153000	Yeah, I don't know where this video comes from, but I see a little logo for a break
3153000	3154920	in the corner, so we'll just leave it at that.
3154920	3157040	Is there like an embed thing?
3157040	3161640	I don't know what hell the site this is, so whatever, we'll just play the rest of it.
3161640	3167160	The side panel snaps off and reveals some hidden screws, so you'll get to work and remove
3167160	3168160	all of them.
3168160	3171800	After popping off the cover, it's time to get rid of some more screws until the DVD
3171800	3172800	drive is screwed up.
3172800	3173800	Okay, I want to see them burn stuff.
3173800	3175360	I don't care about the whole process.
3175360	3176360	We're boring.
3176360	3179280	Now the laser assembly gets attached to the Walter.
3179280	3187000	The new 007 laser weapon easily burns through electrical tape, pops a balloon, and also
3187000	3188760	lights matches.
3188760	3192120	The world's first 007 laser weapon, Burning Blue.
3192120	3196360	Oh my god, if I were still smoking cigarettes, which I don't encourage anyone to do because
3196360	3199880	it's very addicting and I quit, but if I were still smoking cigarettes, what an awesome
3199880	3201720	way to light my cigarette.
3201720	3205920	Hold on guys, I gotta get my gun to light my cigarette.
3205920	3209400	Actually they had lighters that looked like little guns, but they just had fire instead
3209400	3211400	of lasers.
3211400	3213120	Anyhow.
3213120	3216640	Oh wow.
3216640	3219160	Sorry, just had a dream.
3219160	3224280	I was a super spy for a minute with all these kinds of cool gadgets.
3224280	3227360	But yeah, I won't be getting one of these anytime soon because I'm sure there's laws
3227360	3228360	against it.
3228360	3233100	However, there are some cool new games I could be getting pretty soon, but I'd have to travel
3233100	3237820	to Europe to get some of these games, right DarkSakura?
3237820	3239480	Actually no, nothing.
3239480	3240480	Nothing?
3240480	3241480	There's nothing I can buy?
3241480	3243040	Nothing on the list.
3243040	3244040	Well then I guess I get my laser.
3244040	3245040	Not until the 16th.
3245040	3246040	I guess I get my laser.
3246040	3248200	Do we have any releases in the US?
3248200	3252000	Yes, there are some crappy releases coming through the US.
3252000	3256080	The first being Paws and Claws Pampered Pets for the Nintendo DS.
3256080	3262240	Man, that's an ugly looking picture there with chihuahuas and ugly cats.
3262240	3263680	They're all ugly characters.
3263680	3268360	Paws and Claws Pet Resort, the same game but now on the Wii.
3268360	3273400	Bigfoot Collision Course on the Nintendo DS, no pets involved with that one.
3273400	3279760	Elibits, The Adventures of Kai and Zero on the DS, the sequel to the cool 3D game and
3279760	3282520	now this is more like Pokemon.
3282520	3286680	Moon is coming out from Mastiff on the Nintendo DS.
3286680	3290360	Fishy Master World Tour on the Nintendo Wii.
3290360	3295840	Jumble Madness, another fun puzzle game on the DS.
3295840	3298560	And let's see here.
3298560	3302400	Neighborhood Games on Nintendo Wii.
3302400	3307760	Personal Trainer Math from Nintendo, because Nintendo thinks you don't know math.
3307760	3311360	Can I interrupt these shitty games with a funny chat room comment?
3311360	3312360	Sure.
3312360	3315720	I mean as much as I'm sure our listening audience cares about all these fucking math games,
3315720	3320480	this is just too funny because you know we're a little bit delayed so sometimes our comments
3320480	3323680	on the previous story take a little while to run through chat so a comment on the whole
3323680	3324760	laser thing.
3324760	3328880	Shahran in chat says, imagine holding up a convenience store with that.
3328880	3335000	Give me the money or I'll fucking laser your face.
3335000	3338440	Horse Launch Radio does not condone these actions.
3338440	3342000	You could brand somebody with a laser.
3342000	3345640	Okay sorry Loki, continue telling us about the edutainment titles aplenty coming out
3345640	3346640	this week.
3346640	3347640	No that's actually it.
3347640	3348640	Oh okay, good.
3348640	3352360	Alright then let's talk about- What, no Jazz Jackrabbit?
3352360	3353360	Alright.
3353360	3357700	Let's talk about Japan and what you can look forward to over there.
3357700	3361200	And actually it's a lot of price release, or price reductions, at least on the Xbox
3361200	3362200	360.
3362200	3366360	Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom, and Trusty Bell, which is our eternal sonata, they are
3366360	3370320	both getting price reductions this week over in Japan, so enjoy those.
3370320	3375320	PlayStation 3, nada coming out this week, you gotta wait till the 15th for anything
3375320	3377400	coming out over there.
3377400	3382440	Fallout 3 makes its debut on the 15th, you have that to look forward to.
3382440	3388720	On the PlayStation 2, nothing, on the DS, nothing till the 15th, and it's probably the
3388720	3390400	same story on the PSP as well.
3390400	3394960	So that's really it, unless you want some price reductions, there is a Mobile Suit Gundam
3394960	3401520	game on the PSP, Giron no Yabu, Axis no Kaiyui gets a price reduction, that's it.
3401520	3407120	So it's the week of sales in Japan, otherwise no new stuff till the 15th.
3407120	3410080	Well then how about just a little something else?
3410080	3411480	How about it?
3411480	3412640	Um, stuff.
3412640	3413840	And nonsense.
3413840	3417840	And download content!
3417840	3418840	Horse armor?
3418840	3421320	What the hell?
3421320	3423200	You know, like Oblivion had the horse armor?
3423200	3426200	Ah, forget it.
3426200	3427200	Forget it.
3427200	3428200	Anyway.
3428200	3436480	Um, for the fans of Guitar Hero World Tour, there is a downloadable content, um, dated,
3436480	3442760	it actually will be coming out, um, January 2009, at some point eventually.
3442760	3445420	So let's go ahead and go by the date.
3445420	3454220	So there will be, um, actually this should already, um, be out as Use Me by Hinder, Because
3454220	3462760	of You by Nickelback, and Light It Up by Revtheory, um, on the 8th, there is, um, a, uh, Country
3462760	3468080	Rock Track Pack, which is Me and My Gang by Rascal Flats, Tix by Brad Paisley, and Hillbilly
3468080	3470280	Deluxe by Brooks and Dunn.
3470280	3478360	Um, there's also, um, on January 15th, there will be Three Songs by Travis Barker.
3478360	3485840	Um, the 22nd of January, there will be, um, Tomorrow by Silverchair, Dimension by Wolf
3485840	3489040	Mother, and Out of the Way by The Vines.
3489040	3497400	And then on the 29th, we have, um, uh, Oasis, um, with the full, uh, Dig Out Your Soul album,
3497400	3500500	and, um, yeah.
3500500	3509400	The album is going to be, um, 1,520 Microsoft Points, um, or, um, $18.99 from the PlayStation
3509400	3510400	Store.
3510400	3514160	I was gonna ask if that was the first full album for Guitar Hero, but I guess it's not,
3514160	3517360	because they had the Metallica one, Death Magnetic came out, the full album, when the
3517360	3518360	CD came out, right?
3518360	3520920	Yeah, it's not the first album that they've had, they've had a few.
3520920	3521920	Oh, okay.
3521920	3522920	Hmm.
3522920	3525120	And Metallica's infinitely more awesome than Oasis.
3525120	3528520	Uh, yeah, I'd say so.
3528520	3529520	So.
3529520	3530520	Interesting.
3530520	3536720	Um, some other cool stuff that's coming out on the other music game platform, Rock Band.
3536720	3544760	Um, the January lineup has been leaked out, as they seem to always happen, um, to do.
3544760	3549400	Of course, we already knew that Roy Orbison was getting a download pack, um, they're gonna
3549400	3551080	be six tracks available there.
3551080	3557600	Claudette in Dreams, Mean Woman Blues, Oh Pretty Woman, Ooby Dooby, and You Got It.
3557600	3565600	Um, then also, um, there will be a Lenny Kravitz pack, with, uh, Are You Going My Way, Freedom
3565600	3571880	Train, Let Love Rule, and Mr. Cab Driver, and then finally two tracks from the Steve
3571880	3575640	Miller band The Joker and Space Cowboy.
3575640	3579120	See I think there's like one track in each of those packs you mentioned that I would
3579120	3580120	want to get.
3580120	3584440	Like, I don't think I can possibly be a guitar playing gamer and not want to get Lenny Kravitz
3584440	3587980	Are You Gonna Go My Way, because that song is all kinds of awesome, um, even though I
3587980	3590800	know it's in Guitar Hero World Tour but I still don't own that, I should get that at
3590800	3591800	some point.
3591800	3596080	Um, but I also want Pretty Woman and I want, um, The Joker.
3596080	3597080	So that's pretty awesome.
3597080	3598080	Yeah.
3598080	3601640	You said I don't really want the packs, I just want the one song from each pack.
3601640	3602920	Forget it.
3602920	3607480	Anyhow, let's talk about someone who's stupid, but we actually can't give this person a stupid
3607480	3610560	award because there's someone even dumber we're going to talk about later in the show,
3610560	3614760	so just imagine what it's going to take to top this, but, uh, just more of an FYI to
3614760	3618880	all of you people out there in the world, please do not actually take your credit card
3618880	3620960	and, uh, put it in a Wii.
3620960	3625800	Now keep this in mind, because the first thing I thought when I heard this, I'm like, bullshit,
3625800	3631360	somebody's doing this as a joke, this is coming from a forum, so, uh, you know, take it with
3631360	3632840	a grain of salt, okay?
3632840	3640080	Um, however, apparently somebody posted on this forum, um, their neighbors actually got
3640080	3643840	a Wii for Christmas, there was no games, but they got a classic controller and a nunchuck
3643840	3651040	combo and a case and all that stuff, and, uh, so they were asking the kid for recommendations,
3651040	3655200	they recommended Animal Crossing City Folk, Wario Land Shake It, Mario Kart Wii, and Super
3655200	3659920	Mario Galaxy, those are all good recommendations, I think, uh, and then said to go on and get
3659920	3665640	some virtual console games like Super Mario World and Sonic 2, uh, so the mom said, asked
3665640	3670280	what virtual console is and da da da, and the kid said, all you have to do is put in
3670280	3673400	your credit card when you're prompted to on the shop channel.
3673400	3675000	So what does she do?
3675000	3678400	She actually tried to put three credit cards into the disc slot.
3678400	3682000	What a fucking moron.
3682000	3684800	That's why I'm like, nobody can really be this stupid.
3684800	3685800	Can they?
3685800	3686800	Really?
3686800	3687800	Really?
3687800	3691160	Can you go back to like those horror stories from tech support where somebody called, you
3691160	3696280	know, like saying that they accidentally snapped off the, uh, uh, cup holder on their computer,
3696280	3699880	which was actually the CD-ROM drive?
3699880	3700880	You've lived it, Drew.
3700880	3703120	Drew, can you, is this possible?
3703120	3706360	Do you think this level of stupidity is actually possible, Drew?
3706360	3709400	It is both possible and rampant.
3709400	3710640	Why?
3710640	3711640	Why do people actually think that?
3711640	3716300	I mean, doesn't the screen make it pretty clear that you put in your credit card number?
3716300	3720920	There are people out there who do not touch half the buttons on their TV remotes because
3720920	3726240	they think we'll make the TV explode.
3726240	3727240	I am teaching.
3727240	3728320	Maybe they need those buttons.
3728320	3731040	I do not push else explosion.
3731040	3736480	I am teaching certain family members to use the digital cable guide as we speak.
3736480	3739040	Hey, wait, wait a minute though.
3739040	3743600	I will say Comcast system is pretty screwy that that does take a class or two to learn
3743600	3744600	how to use.
3744600	3747760	You need a college degree to be able to navigate that.
3747760	3749240	It's not TiVo, Drew.
3749240	3751520	I've never used TiVo.
3751520	3753040	It's happy face and frown face.
3753040	3755880	No, thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to rate things.
3755880	3760080	I mean, a four year old could figure it out, I hope.
3760080	3761120	But Comcast?
3761120	3764120	Kind of crappy.
3764120	3771600	Kazaam in chat, or Kazaam in chat, the name I can't pronounce tonight, says, once my friend
3771600	3776400	was at work, this woman came in and was buying a Playstation 3 game, and she was asking him
3776400	3778160	will it work on her VCR.
3778160	3785680	Well, ma'am, do you have a beta?
3785680	3786680	So I don't know.
3786680	3791920	Apparently this is what it looks like if you actually put your credit card in the Wii is
3791920	3796580	that then suddenly your system will have a lot of lines going through it and it's unable
3796580	3801360	to read a disk because there's no actual disk in the system, just a jammed credit card.
3801360	3802360	Congrats.
3802360	3803360	God.
3803360	3804480	I don't know.
3804480	3807960	I kind of call bullshit, but it's a funny story nonetheless.
3807960	3813040	You know somewhere someone's tried to do it, but what's happened here is that somebody's
3813040	3816320	actually recorded it.
3816320	3822000	Anyhow, let's talk about something a lot more relevant and something the smart people do.
3822000	3826320	And what smart people do is that they go and they try to explore their gaming's history
3826320	3829560	and play some obscure video games they may not have before.
3829560	3832880	And Dark Sakura, well, heck, she's one of the smartest and she's here to pick.
3832880	3834880	She's the most smartest, in fact.
3834880	3838720	And she's here to pick a video game for you to play this week in a segment we call The
3838720	3844320	Classic Game of the Week.
3844320	3845900	So what should the kids play this week?
3845900	3849480	The Classic Game of the Week was suggested to me by Sauce.
3849480	3850480	I see.
3850480	3855280	So this is a saucy way to kick in 2009.
3855280	3857800	Captain America and the Avengers.
3857800	3859760	Yay.
3859760	3862680	This game is classic.
3862680	3872680	Side scrolling, beat em up action with cheese ball voice acting and wonderful background
3872680	3873680	music.
3873680	3877600	Let's just have some of this background music.
3877600	3880400	Can we, Rob?
3880400	3884600	Well, maybe after the story part.
3884600	3901840	Anyway, you get to play as one of four of the Avengers, either Captain America, Iron
3901840	3908760	Man, Hawkeye, or Vision, which why Vision is all white and not green and red, like Christmas
3908760	3909760	is beyond me.
3909760	3913840	It could just be graphical limitations at the time.
3913840	3919000	But you could actually either play a four player cabinet or a two player cabinet.
3919000	3921960	You just have to change it on the board itself.
3921960	3922960	That's pretty cool.
3922960	3927560	And you get sound effects, like in old comic books.
3927560	3931360	You get black, wham.
3931360	3932360	Or 60s Batman.
3932360	3933360	Yeah, or 60s Batman.
3933360	3934360	I grew up on this frickin' game.
3934360	3939920	I remember playing it at Pizza Hut when I was six.
3939920	3940920	No, it's great.
3940920	3946320	It's the reason I went out to eat Pizza Hut, because the pizza certainly sucked.
3946320	3948720	I went there to play Captain America in the frickin' event.
3948720	3952040	Oh no, don't go to Pizza Hut and expect to get pizza.
3952040	3954040	Oh no.
3954040	3963360	Anyway, you actually fight different, you know, your bosses, which will be Klaw, the
3963360	3972000	Living Laser, Whirlwind, the Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin, Juggernaut, Ultron,
3972000	3975440	Crossbones, and the Red Skull.
3975440	3982480	You also get cameos by other Avengers, which, was Namor ever an Avenger, because it says
3982480	3983480	he's in the game.
3983480	3988800	I don't think he ever really was one.
3988800	3994560	He was by hanging around sometimes, and shouting imperious ones.
3994560	3999440	Anyway, but you had Wasp, Quicksilver, and Wonder Man.
3999440	4001160	Is Samuel L. Jackson in it?
4001160	4003800	No, this was before.
4003800	4006400	This was before Ultimates.
4006400	4008840	I see.
4008840	4017160	This was David Hasselhoff era.
4017160	4022120	Unfortunately, while the arcade version was great, the console ports really sucked.
4022120	4027960	That's what I was getting to.
4027960	4033200	The game was put out by Data East, and they released the Genesis version, and after that
4033200	4038400	it was licensed to Mindscape, so there was a port to the Super Nintendo, the Game Boy,
4038400	4041360	and the Game Gear.
4041360	4047600	There was also an NES version, where you could only play as Captain America and Hawkeye,
4047600	4051720	and you had to save Vision and Iron Man from the Mandarin.
4051720	4056160	Which was kind of like playing Bionic, and it was actually supported, had this map set
4056160	4057160	up like Bionic Commando.
4057160	4058160	Yeah, it was a platformer.
4058160	4059160	Yeah.
4059160	4060160	It kind of sucked, too.
4060160	4065880	Oh yeah, because Mandarin would so be able to do that.
4065880	4066880	Well it-
4066880	4067880	As if.
4067880	4068880	Shock.
4068880	4074760	At any rate, another bit of fun trivia is that the North American version of the arcade
4074760	4080520	machine, when your character dies, instead of saying continue, or like, America still
4080520	4083440	needs your help.
4083440	4085880	That's the part I remember about this game.
4085880	4087600	Even I played this game when I was younger.
4087600	4088600	I wasn't six.
4088600	4091960	I was a little bit older, but a little bit.
4091960	4095280	But I do remember that when you would die, America still needs your help.
4095280	4096280	Yeah.
4096280	4099640	It's a really lame- I can't move!
4099640	4101680	It really tries to guilt you when they continue playing.
4101680	4106320	Like if you don't put in another quarter, you are a terrorist.
4106320	4107320	Basically.
4107320	4112640	Well, clearly that line was removed from the Asian-European versions.
4112640	4116560	Dear Data East, make more pinball.
4116560	4118120	Where's our Avengers pinball?
4118120	4119680	The end.
4119680	4123960	Alright, so there it is, your classic video game of the week.
4123960	4126680	Captain America and the Avengers.
4126680	4129880	Please note- Sounds like a bad band.
4129880	4136320	Specifically though, here are the arcade versions, not the console versions, which are a little
4136320	4137320	bit shit.
4137320	4138880	A little bit.
4138880	4139880	There you have it.
4139880	4140880	Your classic video game of the week.
4140880	4144280	So that's going to be a hard one for the kids to find, because you know, we would never
4144280	4146840	endorse downloading ROMs and playing them on emulators.
4146840	4147840	Oh no no.
4147840	4149720	No, we've never used MAME in our lives.
4149720	4153160	So you're going to need to find a Pizza Hut near you that still has this game.
4153160	4154520	So good luck with that.
4154520	4156080	Let us know what you find.
4156080	4159760	Alright, so that's going to do it for this part A of our show, but hey, we still have
4159760	4166080	plenty more, including, including hello tonight, we are going to play Match Game.
4166080	4168720	That's right, tonight we're going to play Match Game and give away some prize.
4168720	4171200	Are we going to tell them what the prize is that we're giving away tonight, or are we
4171200	4173480	keeping it a secret, or what are we doing?
4173480	4175520	We will tell you right after the break.
4175520	4178280	Oh ho ho, good tease, alright.
4178280	4180720	So we'll tell you right after the break, so stay tuned.
4180720	4183760	See the podcast listeners though, they're not going to have to wait at all, except then
4183760	4186120	again they don't get to play either, because the game will be done by the time this is
4186120	4187120	the podcast feed.
4187120	4188120	Sorry guys.
4188120	4190800	I promise there will be a contest you can do very soon.
4190800	4201320	Anyhow, let's take a break, we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4201320	4205080	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the
4205080	4207080	4th of 2009.
4207080	4212520	I'm very happy because I'm eating ice cream, Dark Soccer and Tiara Rara, or Sauce, brought
4212520	4216120	ice cream tonight for us, and it's like the slow churn kind, so it's actually not that
4216120	4219360	bad as far as fat goes either, so that made me very happy.
4219360	4221160	Thank you both for thinking of that.
4221160	4222160	Good.
4222160	4224920	Now do we get to talk about our fabulous prizes tonight.
4224920	4228760	The chat room, you see the podcast listeners just mere seconds had to wait, but the folks
4228760	4233000	in chat, they've had to wait like 20 minutes, because we had such a long break tonight because
4233000	4236440	of ice cream, to figure out what they're playing for tonight, so yeah.
4236440	4241120	And Dark Knight in chat says, I hope you guys get brain freezes, but what is the fabulous
4241120	4243120	prize you're going to play for tonight?
4243120	4248880	Well tonight I have brought the prize, it is a $25 Amazon gift certificate.
4248880	4254000	Wow, that's like a DS game right there, alright, very nice.
4254000	4256120	So is this courtesy of AvengersTower.com?
4256120	4258160	Sure, why not.
4258160	4263600	I figured you guys have given Xbox related stuff out as prizes before, and some people
4263600	4269560	don't have Xboxes, or some people would rather spend it on other things, so Amazon gift certificate
4269560	4274560	kind of is whatever you want, you can spend it game related, or else whatever you want
4274560	4275560	to spend it on.
4275560	4278840	Alright, and our chat room is subsequently freaking out tonight, they're like, oh my
4278840	4284040	gosh, it's $25 tonight, so the stakes are high tonight in match games, so we'll have
4284040	4287840	a qualifying question later on, and then it will be the first person to get through on
4287840	4292360	Skype when I say, not yet, when I say, if you call now you're going to piss me off,
4292360	4296960	I'm not going to answer your call later, but when I say, we'll get to that a little later
4296960	4301160	in the show, and it's match game tonight, and not only is it match game, it's epic match
4301160	4304600	game, because there's five questions instead of the usual three, because we do have a big
4304600	4312240	prize on the line tonight, so yeah, $25, there you go, and yeah, so sorry, those of us here
4312240	4316640	in the studio can't win, I know as much as you want to win, you got to give it to a listener.
4316640	4324800	Alright, Kazam and Chat says, that's like two euro, sad but true, sad but true.
4324800	4328920	Alright, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news before we get to the fancy prizes, big
4328920	4332440	money, big prizes, Loki, why don't you start us off?
4332440	4339240	Alright, sweet, well, there's, I think we talked about this last week, there was some
4339240	4346480	new Sega games, or I should say older Sega games, that were getting new ESRB listings,
4346480	4352600	and one of those actually, that wasn't quite part of one of the ESRB listings, but it's
4352600	4358280	been re-registered by Sega for another trademark, would be Choo Choo Rocket.
4358280	4366480	Apparently on December 22nd, Sega USA has a re-registered Choo Choo trademark as one
4366480	4373020	of many Dreamcast titles to get, I guess, remade.
4373020	4378160	Some other trademarks that have been re-registered as well, Sonic Shuffle, Cosmic Smash, Jet
4378160	4385280	Grind Radio, Virtual On, and now Choo Choo Rocket.
4385280	4389600	That's interesting, I wonder what that means, it might actually be possibly coming out on
4389600	4395040	Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare, as people seem to think.
4395040	4399760	Awesome, I guess if you're a huge fan of Choo Choo Rocket, I don't know, I was never that
4399760	4404720	big on Choo Choo Rocket, but I'm hoping this means, I'm hoping that maybe some other big
4404720	4408920	games will come out, thanks to this, so we'll see.
4408920	4413080	Alright, sorry I'm laughing, because if I sound like I'm laughing, it's because I am,
4413080	4416480	because I really shouldn't do this, but I send private messages during the show, and
4416480	4421020	whatever, I know Jamie does it too, so we're all chatting and whatever during the show,
4421020	4424160	so sometimes I send funny things, so that's why I'm laughing.
4424160	4426480	Loki, do you talk to anyone else while the show's going on?
4426480	4427480	No.
4427480	4428480	Oh.
4428480	4429480	Loser.
4429480	4431480	I was talking to Drew, but now I'm done.
4431480	4432480	You were talking to Drew?
4432480	4436200	Yeah, I was IMing him with my phone, but now I signed out, because it's too hard to text
4436200	4437600	IM.
4437600	4442160	You guys are sitting literally mere feet away from each other, you could write on a paper.
4442160	4449400	We did this the other night, because I sent something to her on Twitter, and then I was
4449400	4452400	like, wait, she was right behind me.
4452400	4456040	Or, and I guess I'll say this now, I was going to kind of leave it a secret until we come
4456040	4461240	back from vacation and I actually have it hung up, however, the studio got a new present
4461240	4470040	this week, thanks to Rama, sent us right over here, this whiteboard, and you might remember
4470040	4477020	why we, I love this, we say something random on air and suddenly it shows up in my mail,
4477020	4482400	we had talked about in the garage, hanging up in the big blank spot we have, a whiteboard
4482400	4487760	to keep our issues that we have with, I think it was GameStop at the time, but I'm thinking
4487760	4490760	maybe just our issues we have with various gaming companies we can actually write up
4490760	4495920	there on the board, so we will actually have a whiteboard come the return of, come the
4495920	4512560	return of, and I believe we'll also have a camera, finally, again next week, to actually
4512560	4513560	show the board with, so, we'll talk more about all the stuff, we'll see, we'll see, anyhow,
4513560	4517400	hey, Q Games, talking on the Playstation blog this week about some games that are coming
4517400	4523320	out in 2009, they are pixel junk titles, two or three of them, apparently, are coming out
4523320	4527560	this year, one of them has already come out, that was Pixel Junk Monsters for the PSP,
4527560	4531960	however, who knows what the others could be, although, you know, if you believe what you've
4531960	4538400	seen on Spike TV lately, there was skiing, fighting, and so on, so you can probably imagine
4538400	4542160	there's going to be a pixel junk about some other type of genre you've probably already
4542160	4547740	seen before, but, of course, one of the last games we got from them was Pixel Junk Eden,
4547740	4552600	which was kind of like random, so who knows what it's going to be, I do not play this
4552600	4556400	series an awful lot, but I know it's one of the few exclusive series they've got going
4556400	4558840	on right now, right, Logie?
4558840	4559840	Which one, though?
4559840	4560840	Pixel Junk?
4560840	4563240	Yes, it is one exclusive series that they have going on.
4563240	4564240	Have you ever played it?
4564240	4566680	I have not played these games personally, so I don't know a whole lot about it.
4566680	4570080	I thought there was another one, like a Pixel Junk Racer game, as well.
4570080	4571080	I think there is.
4571080	4572080	Yeah.
4572080	4576720	I don't know, I haven't really touched any of them, but remember, lately, you know, up
4576720	4581640	until about a couple weeks ago, I didn't realize that, you know, I couldn't just spend the
4581640	4586000	exact amount on the PlayStation Network for things, although I still don't see myself
4586000	4591280	playing a lot of stuff on the PlayStation 3, so, uh, I'm a little hesitant to buy stuff
4591280	4597360	like Pixel Junk games, just because I have so many Xbox Live Arcade games that I don't
4597360	4600480	play, you know what I mean?
4600480	4601480	Yeah, I hear you.
4601480	4604440	All right, well, just thought I'd check.
4604440	4608360	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.
4608360	4609360	Jamie?
4609360	4617360	Well, this is, I guess, a matter of debate for several people.
4617360	4625920	They're saying that collectible games are losing their value because of digital re-releases,
4625920	4632600	especially if, you know, go look on Amazon, not on Amazon, but on eBay, for a lot of these
4632600	4637800	titles, people are just not getting the money that they used to be able to get for them.
4637800	4646160	For example, um, uh, Ikaruga, um, was, uh, $75 for the Dreamcast version, $45 for the
4646160	4651200	GameCube version, um, when they both came out on Xbox Live Arcade, uh, the games went
4651200	4662640	to $5 to $15, um, really, I honestly, I'm not really, I don't really care that much.
4662640	4663880	This is good news for me.
4663880	4667480	You collect a lot of video games, you have some obscure fucking shit in your house, so
4667480	4670920	if anybody's gonna be pissed off, I'd imagine you'd be.
4670920	4671920	Why?
4671920	4677160	I have these games because I want to play the originals on the original system.
4677160	4683280	If they go down in price, that means I can go buy them a lot easier than I would have
4683280	4688400	been able to before, and I can hook up my Turbo Duo and freakin' play these games.
4688400	4695560	Sapphire got re-released in Japan, you know, I could play it on, on PSP if I wanted to,
4695560	4700000	but I still want to have the Turbo, the, actually I need to have a system that will support
4700000	4705040	an arcade card, but I'd really love to play it on Turbo Duo, or on, I should say, PC Engine
4705040	4711760	Duo, um, it, I don't really care so much about them being re-released, because the whole
4711760	4716480	reason, now I was, I was kinda giddy for a little while about my version of, about having
4716480	4722500	Dracula X, when, ooh, $300, I got it for $100, ooh, and, and then I was like, but, really,
4722500	4727760	the whole reason I wanted the game was to play it, because it's a fun game, and if it's
4727760	4733500	being re-released, that means that, you know, more people can actually get a chance to play
4733500	4735720	the, the fun shit that I have.
4735720	4737720	Like Suikoden this week, or Castlevania Chronicles.
4737720	4740160	Well I don't really give a crap about Suikoden, sorry.
4740160	4741160	Castlevania Chronicles?
4741160	4742160	Yeah.
4742160	4743160	Okay.
4743160	4747840	But I mean, it's, it's, it's just, it's a game.
4747840	4751560	Why shouldn't they re-release it, especially if they know people love it?
4751560	4756040	Why shouldn't they try to make money off of old franchises, seriously?
4756040	4757560	I have no problem with it.
4757560	4764080	Even though, ooh, you're not special anymore, ooh, you know, if you've got the original
4764080	4770720	game, and you've got the original system, and you can play said game on said system,
4770720	4771720	that's pretty special.
4771720	4773360	It's still kinda cool.
4773360	4775480	It's, it's pretty cool, I think.
4775480	4779280	I mean, you can, you've got the original experience in your hands.
4779280	4785800	You can fit, like, every Atari 2600 cartridge ever made onto one CD, probably, but it's
4785800	4790480	still, like, kinda cool when you actually see, like, an Atari 2600 system, and you actually
4790480	4793920	see, like, the cartridge for Sword Quest, it's kinda like, oh cool, I remember this
4793920	4794920	game.
4794920	4799560	We hook up our nests and blow in the thing all the time, just to, you know, it's the
4799560	4800560	same thing.
4800560	4801560	It's-
4801560	4806880	Rob, you could probably fit every single Atari 2600 cartridge onto one PlayStation 2 memory
4806880	4807880	card.
4807880	4808880	Probably, I wouldn't doubt it.
4808880	4810720	Six megs for all the ROMs.
4810720	4813280	Don't ask me how I know that.
4813280	4814960	How do you kn- never mind.
4814960	4819320	Well, at any rate, it's, it's a difference in experience.
4819320	4824600	You can play the game, or you could go back on the system, and that's why I had a big
4824600	4829680	problem with emulation for a little while, and it wasn't that I had a problem with people
4829680	4833240	ripping games and emulating them and this, that, and the other, it's the fact that I
4833240	4838560	really wanted to have the original game so that I could play it on my system and play
4838560	4843120	the game the way other people played the game, you know, you know what I mean?
4843120	4844120	Right.
4844120	4849640	And, so that's where I think the, the special part of it is, you know, is having it and
4849640	4853200	playing it, but seriously, if other people get to enjoy the game, I have no problem with
4853200	4854200	it.
4854200	4858960	If it makes it cheaper for me to get those games that I want, by all means!
4858960	4859960	You know?
4859960	4860960	Let's release more!
4860960	4866000	Now tell me, though, how many people have a, uh, Turbo Duo.
4866000	4868000	Mmm.
4868000	4869000	It still works.
4869000	4870000	You do.
4870000	4871000	I know.
4871000	4872600	And I love it.
4872600	4873600	But you know what?
4873600	4878000	If anyone wanted to play my Turbo Duo, I would bring it over.
4878000	4883840	As long as their house wasn't, you know, covered in dust that went up to my knees.
4883840	4886320	Very nice.
4886320	4888720	Your house is not that dusty!
4888720	4889720	My house?
4889720	4890720	Is it?
4890720	4891720	No, Andrew's over there making faces at me.
4891720	4892720	Oh.
4892720	4893720	I don't know.
4893720	4894720	Alright.
4894720	4895720	My car is very dusty.
4895720	4896900	It's probably dustier than your house.
4896900	4900920	My PlayStation 3 is really dusty, except in the area where the eject button and the power
4900920	4901920	button is.
4901920	4902920	It's like a dust magnet.
4902920	4903920	It's very interesting.
4903920	4906120	If I didn't dust ours, it'd be like that.
4906120	4908120	Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
4908120	4913000	You should put, like, that end dust on it or something, or, yeah, that would suck the
4913000	4914040	dust to it.
4914040	4915600	Let me, uh, read some comments from chat here.
4915600	4919040	Footy, I'm sorry, not Footy Monster, Act F says, uh, Collectors, Swap Meets are your
4919040	4920040	friends.
4920040	4921200	I speak for my friends' experience.
4921200	4922200	And my own.
4922200	4923200	I don't know.
4923200	4926560	Have you had a lot of luck at Swap Meets, Dark Sakura, in your collecting?
4926560	4927560	Every so often.
4927560	4928560	Yeah.
4928560	4929560	Very cool.
4929560	4930560	Hmm.
4930560	4936320	Well, um, I know when Mega Man 9 came out earlier this year, it was pretty much the
4936320	4942640	retro gamer's kind of dream game, um, especially, you know, perfect release for the, uh, Mega
4942640	4947400	Man series, kind of going back to the roots of, like, the earlier Mega Man games.
4947400	4949880	Well, it almost wasn't the case.
4949880	4955720	Um, actually, 1UP did an interview with the producer of Mega Man 9 and said, uh, they
4955720	4963120	had heard a bunch of, um, they were, management of Capcom was actually talking about doing
4963120	4972280	a 3D Mega Man game for Mega Man 9 instead, um, which is interesting, and says, um, you
4972280	4974920	know, they had heard lots of negative responses.
4974920	4979600	They thought that it would be better to make it 3D and that the 8-bit style will only appeal
4979600	4987280	to Mega Man fans, which would limit the sales potential, because it's all about money.
4987280	4992120	And eventually they figured out that 8-bit graphics were also cheap to develop, which
4992120	4995600	also made them money, so, yay!
4995600	4999760	I just, I mean, would it have been the 3D game, like, the Mega Man Legends you've always
4999760	5002600	been asking for, or would it have just been, like, just some shitacious arcade game?
5002600	5006800	I think it would be, like, the later Mega Man X games, where it's, like, 3D, 2D type
5006800	5013240	thing, um, which, you know, looking at Bionic Re-Armed, and, you know, Bionic Commander
5013240	5019320	Re-Armed wouldn't be all that bad, but it's just not, you know, Mega Man 9.
5019320	5022280	It would really depend, it would just really, really depend.
5022280	5026920	I still think they should go back and do some new Mega Man Legends games for the Wii.
5026920	5031680	I think it would be perfect, because the Wii can't really churn out anything, you know,
5031680	5038160	that fantastic, so, it should be able to handle some ports of PlayStation 1 games, and, hell,
5038160	5040320	I liked Mega Man Legends, I thought it was awesome.
5040320	5042280	Do you think there'll be a Mega Man 10?
5042280	5043280	Someday.
5043280	5044280	Someday.
5044280	5047280	I think Mega Man 9 did really well, so, uh...
5047280	5050600	Or will they just call it Mega Man X and then really confuse us, because, you know, there's
5050600	5053000	Mega Man 10 and now Mega Man X, it's just too confusing.
5053000	5054000	Uh...
5054000	5055640	How about Mega Man 9-2?
5055640	5058000	What happens when they get to Mega Man X-10?
5058000	5061120	Uh, too crazy.
5061120	5062120	Mega Man Triple X.
5062120	5063120	Oh, yeah.
5063120	5064120	Oh, yeah.
5064120	5065120	Isn't that already fan-fiction?
5065120	5066120	The love robots.
5066120	5071640	You have to kill Cock Man and Boob Woman.
5071640	5075160	Anyway, um, excuse me.
5075160	5077360	I can hear the show going down the toilet.
5077360	5078720	It must be that time for...
5078720	5081720	Stupid Award!
5081720	5087240	Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the stupidest of them all?
5087240	5092400	Well, this week, it is a 17-year-old, and so, therefore, we don't know their name, because
5092400	5098600	it's some dumb kid, and this 17-year-old lives in Ohio, and what he did this week, he threatened
5098600	5101080	to commit suicide on an internet video game.
5101080	5102400	What game?
5102400	5103400	World of Warcraft.
5103400	5104520	That's right.
5104520	5111480	He paged a GM in World of Warcraft and told the GM that he was suicidal, that the game
5111480	5115520	is the only thing that he has to live for, and you might think, gee, Rob, that's pretty
5115520	5118680	harsh of you to give somebody who's suicidal a stupid award.
5118680	5120960	Well, uh, here's the whole thing.
5120960	5122400	It was a joke.
5122400	5129640	The kid did it as a joke, quote, to try and get what he wanted for the game.
5129640	5134920	So in other words, because he wanted his fat purple loots or whatever, he tried to threaten
5134920	5141700	suicide to try to get a sympathetic Blizzard employee, I guess, to give him free stuff
5141700	5142700	in the game.
5142700	5143700	I would've loved that.
5143700	5144700	Just me.
5144700	5147080	He'd be like, I'm going to kill myself for you.
5147080	5148080	Give me free stuff.
5148080	5149080	Yeah.
5149080	5150080	You go ahead and kill yourself.
5150080	5152480	I have the questions being asked where in Ohio.
5152480	5154720	I think that they're like, oh God, is this in my town?
5154720	5159320	Uh, it was in Middletown because it's being from the Middletown Journal.
5159320	5160320	Oh no, it's Fairfield.
5160320	5161320	Wait, wait.
5161320	5162320	Wait.
5162320	5163320	There's a sympathetic Blizzard employee?
5163320	5164320	Fairfield Township.
5164320	5165320	What are you talking about?
5165320	5167320	What do you mean?
5167320	5169880	There are no sympathetic Blizzard employees.
5169880	5173760	Actually, the one GM I talked to one time was really nice.
5173760	5176520	They said, uh, you know, my character's name is kind of funny.
5176520	5178560	I don't want to repeat it, but you have a funny character name.
5178560	5183040	They're like salutations and said my name and they even gave me a less than three, a
5183040	5184040	little heart.
5184040	5186120	It's a standardized greeting.
5186120	5189960	Oh, whatever.
5189960	5190960	You're a standardized greeting.
5190960	5192360	I talk to a lot of them.
5192360	5195600	Why are you like a, are you like a tattletale or something?
5195600	5197360	I'm a role player.
5197360	5198360	Oh God.
5198360	5199360	Oh God.
5199360	5203840	People love to fuck with me when I'm role playing with other people.
5203840	5204840	I see.
5204840	5205840	All right.
5205840	5209360	Well anyway, uh, by the way, just so you guys know, the kid was handcuffed and placed in
5209360	5210360	a patrol car.
5210360	5214400	Uh, the boy was, which Jamie is applauding.
5214400	5218680	The boy was then released to his father a little later, hopefully for some big spankings,
5218680	5222920	even though he's 17.
5222920	5225600	Somehow I don't think that would stop Jamie if it was her kid.
5225600	5226600	No.
5226600	5231560	If you were, if you were 17, if your 17 year old did this, would you spank them?
5231560	5232560	Yes.
5232560	5237280	Uh, by the way, the kid is going to appear in court on Tuesday, Tuesday, the sixth Butler
5237280	5239640	County juvenile court.
5239640	5241920	Wow.
5241920	5242920	It does.
5242920	5245040	It tells you practically where this kid lives in the story.
5245040	5246040	That's not good.
5246040	5247480	You can probably figure out who it is.
5247480	5248560	I'm not going to say it.
5248560	5251840	That's too much, but it's Billy.
5251840	5253480	Wow.
5253480	5257040	It's a first degree misdemeanor, by the way, for, uh, that whole thing.
5257040	5260780	But you know, as a Blizzard employee, they do, I mean, props to them for taking all the
5260780	5261780	claims seriously.
5261780	5266720	Cause you know, you never know, you know, if you've ever dealt with suicidal people,
5266720	5269160	suicidal people, they just want to talk to anyone that will listen.
5269160	5272520	And I could totally see that I bet Blizzard gets some of these that are legit and like
5272520	5274480	really sad and all that.
5274480	5277440	So it kind of sucks that there's this one asshole kid who has to take the whole thing
5277440	5278440	as a joke.
5278440	5283000	And it's also in their best interest to keep their clients alive so that they can pay their
5283000	5284000	money.
5284000	5285000	Besides just that low key.
5285000	5288600	I just want to say businesses like that or companies like that do take things like that
5288600	5289600	seriously.
5289600	5291560	Cause it's bad PR if they die in them.
5291560	5300280	Well, yeah, but a friend of mine actually, um, her, uh, friend's crazy boyfriend started
5300280	5305240	texting her about how he was going to commit suicide and all this stuff.
5305240	5310520	And uh, he was just crazy and they, uh, you know, he denied everything cause she called
5310520	5312120	the police cause she was worried about him.
5312120	5317080	She had all the text messages, they had phone records, you know, from all the calls and
5317080	5320600	everything and he got dragged off to the funny farm and that could have happened to that
5320600	5321600	kid.
5321600	5324900	You know, they could have said, well, if he's going to commit suicide, let's call the police
5324900	5328000	and have them take him to a mental institution for an evaluation.
5328000	5332680	And I'm not sure if that's better or worse than jail, but long story short, don't be
5332680	5335480	stupid and do things like that.
5335480	5336480	That's right.
5336480	5340020	You ever, you know, a 17 year old should have had the boy who cried wolf read to him when
5340020	5343480	he was, you know, five or younger.
5343480	5346560	Anyhow, there you go.
5346560	5351600	That sounds like a quest that should be in world of Warcraft cause they like parodying,
5351600	5354360	you know, all the fairytales.
5354360	5355360	I don't know.
5355360	5356780	They do like to parody a lot of stuff.
5356780	5360280	They have a parody of PETA in the game, which I thought was really funny.
5360280	5363200	Like if you get the blood of animals on you and then you try to run through this little
5363200	5366760	encampment, like they'll all try to kill you and call you names.
5366760	5369400	So it's kind of funny anyhow.
5369400	5373260	I would think that they would want to throw blood on you, you know.
5373260	5375080	That's not how it works.
5375080	5379540	Anyhow, let's get to the part of the show where you guys get to interact with us.
5379540	5380760	Not the skype line, but the other part.
5380760	5381760	The mailbag!
5381760	5383520	Every week you guys send us emails.
5383520	5387120	Mailbag at orangelaundrytrader.com and we like to read them here on the air.
5387120	5392560	So that's what we're going to do right now is allow you guys to get your emails read
5392560	5393560	on the show.
5393560	5394560	DarkSakura.
5394560	5397560	Well, we've only got three emails.
5397560	5403480	So the first one is from Cheeseburger.
5403480	5406520	Hi, O.L.R.
5406520	5409560	About a year ago while I was doing my math homework, I was listening to your wonderful
5409560	5414840	show when my math book pushed the PSP off the table and broke the screen.
5414840	5420120	I called Sony and even when it was still under extended warranty, they wanted $90 to fix
5420120	5421120	it.
5421120	5422120	Well, I thought, screw that, Sony.
5422120	5424680	And my PSP gathered dust for over a year.
5424680	5427760	Then I discovered the magic of eBay and got a new screen.
5427760	5430400	It's like buying a new PSP all over again.
5430400	5436240	So my question to you guys, and girls, is what games or UMD movies do you recommend?
5436240	5442600	I don't like sports games, but I do like RPGs, MMOs, FPSs, anything else that uses an acronym.
5442600	5443640	I'm sorry.
5443640	5445640	That was me.
5445640	5447000	Anything you guys like, pretty much.
5447000	5450560	I also have a few movies in one game, Medal of Honor Heroes.
5450560	5453600	Oh, and it's a PSP fap.
5453600	5457520	Also my DS has been gathering dust for longer than that, and it's working fine.
5457520	5465520	Any games we're checking out on that, yeah, for PSP.
5465520	5471120	Get Final Fantasy I and II for sure, if you like RPGs, those are pretty awesome remakes.
5471120	5478880	There's also the Metal Gear games that came out on that, the interesting little card games
5478880	5479880	that they were.
5479880	5482560	Patapon's kind of fun if you like little music games like that.
5482560	5483800	Ever extend extra?
5483800	5485120	Yeah, the Q games are fun.
5485120	5486400	I found your copy again.
5486400	5488320	Thank God, bring it back.
5488320	5496280	And I like Space Invaders Extreme was fun too, but I like those music-y type games.
5496280	5499760	As far as UMDs, if you can freaking find any, good luck.
5499760	5502880	Whatever movies you like, dude, don't let me tell you what movies you like.
5502880	5505540	Yeah, they're kind of hard to find, so good luck with that.
5505540	5515000	As far as DS goes, definitely in Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, Cooking Mama 2, Dracula
5515000	5517560	X Chronicles, that's for PSP.
5517560	5521600	Final Fantasy IV, if I'm going to be a Final Fantasy horror, why not?
5521600	5525820	Chrono Trigger is coming out, is out, on DS.
5525820	5529080	So you definitely, Animal Crossing, there's that.
5529080	5534280	Chatroom's recommending DJ Max if you're a music fan for PSP.
5534280	5538640	So there you go, just look online.
5538640	5540200	Good times.
5540200	5541200	Next email?
5541200	5542200	Yes.
5542200	5544760	Is, uh, Dear OLR, first of all, Happy New Year.
5544760	5549640	Here's to the year not resembling the intake valve of a commercial air compressor.
5549640	5554000	By that I mean I hope it does not suck nor seem designed to do just that.
5554000	5558360	Second, to all the Doctor Who fans in the OLR me, here's an article of interest.
5558360	5563400	New Doctor is the youngest ever, and yes, I have seen this.
5563400	5568240	The new Doctor is Tom Green.
5568240	5570240	Tom Green is the new Doctor.
5570240	5572160	Dear God, hell no.
5572160	5581040	Matt Smith is an actor I'm not too familiar with, but he is the youngest to ever play
5581040	5582240	the Doctor.
5582240	5588600	The second youngest was Peter Davison, who is the fifth Doctor.
5588600	5595440	And they've, if I'm right, they've actually already started filming for the 2009 series.
5595440	5597640	But oh well, I don't know too much about him.
5597640	5603460	If any of our listeners overseas know more about this guy, send me some of his stuff
5603460	5608840	so I can see what it is.
5608840	5609840	But yeah.
5609840	5613120	It says, thank you for your time, Hunter Red, Redertainment.
5613120	5618160	This message is brought to you by Zap Attack, insert cheap plug here.
5618160	5620880	There is some Doctor 11 hate going on in chat.
5620880	5624840	Brad from Pod Culture says the casting for Doctor 11 sucks.
5624840	5627560	I am saying this.
5627560	5634660	As much of a 10 fan girl I am, I think I'm going to give the guy a chance.
5634660	5641040	The only Doctor who was ever an awful Doctor was the sixth Doctor.
5641040	5643440	He was scary.
5643440	5649200	So to me, my favorite Doctor to date is still the fourth Doctor, you know, as much as I
5649200	5650200	love 10.
5650200	5655040	But I also sort of see that dividing line between series.
5655040	5657900	We won't even talk about the movie.
5657900	5660680	So in other words, we need to give the guy a chance?
5660680	5661680	Give him a chance.
5661680	5662680	Just give him one episode?
5662680	5663680	No.
5663680	5664680	To make it good?
5664680	5665680	Give him the season.
5665680	5666680	All right.
5666680	5667680	Give the guy a chance.
5667680	5670120	You don't know until you see them in.
5670120	5678320	All we are saying, give Matt Smith a chance.
5678320	5685280	Well, it's just my point is, is you really aren't going to know until you watch it with
5685280	5686280	an open mind.
5686280	5691080	If you watch it expecting him to suck, if you watch it looking for all the faults, you're
5691080	5692080	going to see them.
5692080	5697080	You're not going to enjoy yourself because you're going to be too busy sucking your.
5697080	5699380	He's not David Tennant.
5699380	5700380	And I wind.
5700380	5701380	I did wine.
5701380	5703480	My first day I wind.
5703480	5708280	But my opinion is sit back and watch.
5708280	5713280	You have to watch anyways, because at some point soon Patrick Stewart will be guest starring.
5713280	5716560	So that's that's definitely worthwhile.
5716560	5722180	I think that's probably during one of the special the filler specials next year or this
5722180	5723180	year rather.
5723180	5726360	I'm still stuck in last year, but that's still worth watching.
5726360	5727840	And I mean, just give it a chance.
5727840	5732040	I had actually never watched Doctor Who until recently.
5732040	5736800	And so I guess I'm not as affected by, oh, my God, they're changing him so.
5736800	5739240	You can get it in the Netflix instance download on 360.
5739240	5740480	I found out pretty cool.
5740480	5745360	I do have some on there, but I have the all eight seasons of Red Dwarf to go through first.
5745360	5746360	So.
5746360	5749280	Drew Nami is suggesting Loki is the 13th doctor.
5749280	5751280	You know, I don't think that will work because he's not.
5751280	5753060	I'm not a Doctor Who fan.
5753060	5754560	He's not very British.
5754560	5760240	But from what I'm understanding, the episode with Patrick Stewart on is actually going
5760240	5764440	to be an actual episode, but it's during David Tennant's run still.
5764440	5766760	They should just do Simon Pegg as the next doctor.
5766760	5770000	Simon Pegg has already been in an episode of Doctor Who.
5770000	5771000	But not as the doctor.
5771000	5773960	No, but he's been in an episode in there.
5773960	5782080	I would love Simon Pegg as the doctor, but they are very.
5782080	5786360	They're very continuity conscious.
5786360	5791040	I like the idea of Doctor Who being a woman or it was Catherine Zeta-Jones.
5791040	5792040	Come on.
5792040	5793040	I mean, she sold T-Mobile.
5793040	5794040	She could sell a TARDIS.
5794040	5795040	You know what?
5795040	5796040	I wish, and sorry, spoilers.
5796040	5801400	Who cares if Donna took over as the doctor?
5801400	5804000	John Cleese is the next doctor.
5804000	5808440	You know, now I, now I need to.
5808440	5809440	That would be awesome.
5809440	5813960	I need to see Doctor Who and the Curse of the Fatal Death, which is Rowan Atkinson playing
5813960	5814960	the doctor.
5814960	5816500	No, I need to.
5816500	5818360	You know who they should cast as the doctor?
5818360	5819360	Benny Hill.
5819360	5820360	Isn't he dead?
5820360	5821360	Exhum him.
5821360	5822360	Is Benny Hill dead?
5822360	5823360	Probably.
5823360	5830360	Bono is the next Doctor Who.
5830360	5835640	Now you've got me all curious if Benny Hill is dead or not.
5835640	5836640	All right.
5836640	5837640	He is.
5837640	5838640	All right.
5838640	5840000	Let's take our word for it.
5840000	5841000	All right.
5841000	5842000	Well, I don't know.
5842000	5843720	Make it like a Weekend at Bernie's thing.
5843720	5845280	All right.
5845280	5846280	Let's move on.
5846280	5848240	This show is getting depressing.
5848240	5851240	So moving on to the last email.
5851240	5853800	Christ, he died in 1992.
5853800	5859280	Where did Horace Hahn's radio bring you the late-breaking news?
5859280	5861240	Benny Hill just died.
5861240	5865240	Today is a tragic day.
5865240	5866240	Rob.
5866240	5867240	What?
5867240	5870440	You make me weep.
5870440	5871440	In my heart.
5871440	5874720	Well, I mean, I hadn't seen the guy in a while.
5874720	5877120	I kind of figured he was probably old and dead.
5877120	5878520	I mean, forget it.
5878520	5881320	Okay, there's people I haven't seen in a while.
5881320	5883320	Maybe they're old and dead.
5883320	5884320	Okay?
5884320	5890200	When was the last time you saw Molly Ringwald on TV?
5890200	5891200	I haven't seen my mother in a while.
5891200	5893400	Actually, I saw her on TV the other day.
5893400	5894400	So she's not old and dead.
5894400	5898720	My wife watches a lot of ABC Family and Lifetime.
5898720	5901560	Okay, what about Ally Sheedy?
5901560	5902960	Who's Ally Sheedy?
5902960	5904520	I haven't seen my mother in a week.
5904520	5905520	I hope she's okay.
5905520	5908280	Didn't you see the Breakfast Club?
5908280	5910200	Oh, I don't know any of their names.
5910200	5911800	She was the crazy girl.
5911800	5914040	Okay, but I don't know any of their names.
5914040	5916720	They're just people in the Breakfast Club.
5916720	5924240	Vidpower in chat says, rise from your grave, Benny Hill.
5924240	5927840	Raoul Julia is the next Benny Hill.
5927840	5928840	Tim Curry's still alive.
5928840	5929840	Tim Curry's still doing stuff.
5929840	5930840	He did spam a lot.
5930840	5931840	He will never die.
5931840	5932840	He's not old and dead yet.
5932840	5933840	He's just old.
5933840	5934840	And gay.
5934840	5935840	Next email!
5935840	5936840	Yes?
5936840	5940760	Hey guys, I have a question for Loki.
5940760	5942440	Hey, Loki!
5942440	5944440	This is AlphaKananagram.
5944440	5945440	Just curious.
5945440	5951720	Right now I'm opening my PSP 2001 Slim and Light comma comma comma and I have stripped
5951720	5956480	slash have almost stripped the head of one of the top two screws so now I can't try to
5956480	5958040	fix my D-pad.
5958040	5961320	Any suggestions on how to remove the screw or how to fix my D-pad?
5961320	5966740	It kept going either left or right and sometimes up or down sometimes if I barely touch right
5966740	5967980	it'll go left.
5967980	5970840	This is the first period he's used in the- sorry, the second period he's used in the
5970840	5971840	entire email.
5971840	5974240	Sorry y'all for the grammar.
5974240	5976000	Really in the bad situation at the moment.
5976000	5977660	That's no excuse!
5977660	5979320	Keep on going AlphaKananagram.
5979320	5984840	Sounds like a ribbon cable's looser and possibly some of the contacts are dirty.
5984840	5990600	I mean, shit, like my friend used to play with one of the 360s that we had and for some
5990600	5993920	reason his controller had all sorts of crap on it.
5993920	5997760	It was just like the dirtiest controller I've ever seen and his PSP is the same way.
5997760	6002480	I don't know if this guy like oozed out oil and crap or whatever but he did.
6002480	6006400	So yeah, it could be dirty.
6006400	6007400	So check that.
6007400	6008400	Otherwise, I don't know.
6008400	6012400	And as far as stripping the screw, hopefully you didn't because that would suck because
6012400	6015640	there's not really an easy way to get it out.
6015640	6021160	What I did with one of mine that was almost stripped is I just didn't put it back in.
6021160	6024240	Although you should be able to buy- I think they actually sell some of the replacement
6024240	6025240	screws online.
6025240	6030720	You can buy a kit of like all sorts of miscellaneous parts for the PSP so just buy that.
6030720	6038120	I replaced a shoulder button for one of my PSPs I think one time with kits similar to
6038120	6039120	that.
6039120	6043560	So that'd be the best way to go.
6043560	6047760	Oh and none of those faceplates, the clear ones, ever seem to fit properly which sucks.
6047760	6051880	Because I remember trying to put some of those on too.
6051880	6055880	The Rob D in chat is trying to say that since I haven't been on TV in a while I'm old and
6055880	6058400	dead and I'm young and fabulous.
6058400	6060400	Tell him that he's wrong.
6060400	6062840	WRONG!
6062840	6066120	And then Rama's trying to piggyback on top of that saying of course Skye would have the
6066120	6068040	rainbow colored coffin.
6068040	6071480	And I'm thinking, they have those?
6071480	6074720	If there is such a thing, Elton John's got one reserved.
6074720	6075720	Really?
6075720	6080400	Look, all I ask- This is the platform coffin.
6080400	6091120	All I ask- All I ask is to be buried with my ABBA albums, that's all I ask.
6091120	6096040	Anyhow- You mean the one ABBA album that you have that lives at my house that we haven't
6096040	6098000	given you yet?
6098000	6099000	Actual album?
6099000	6100000	Yeah.
6100000	6101000	You need to bring it over!
6101000	6102000	I want it!
6102000	6103000	I have that Bette Midler one too.
6103000	6104000	Give me my ABBA!
6104000	6105000	It's Supertrooper.
6105000	6110200	Supertrooper, beams are gonna burn- Alright, anyway.
6110200	6111200	Anymore emails?
6111200	6112200	No!
6112200	6118520	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
6118520	6126200	But I think we're to that part of the show where maybe, just maybe, it's about time that
6126200	6128680	we give something away!
6128680	6132720	And we do the match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6132720	6133720	Woohoo!
6133720	6134720	Aren't we?
6134720	6135720	No.
6135720	6148760	I skipped ahead, false alarm, we'll get to the match game in just a little bit.
6148760	6151520	Live radio, wasn't that an ultimate tease?
6151520	6155120	I'm like, no we're not?
6155120	6157640	I might want to edit that later if I remember.
6157640	6158640	We'll see.
6158640	6159640	We'll pretend it didn't happen.
6159640	6161080	We'll just pretend that didn't happen.
6161080	6163360	Let's move on with some more gaming stories.
6163360	6164360	Alright.
6164360	6171840	Well, speaking of how the Playstation 3 was uber awesome in internet browsing, well, the
6171840	6176560	Playstation 3 has been used to break the internet as well.
6176560	6185160	In fact, a cluster of Playstation 3s, 200 to be exact, linked together, were able to do
6185160	6190000	the math to help decrypt the MD5 hash used in VeriSign.
6190000	6197200	So yes, if you have 200 PS3s lying around linked together, you too can crack supposedly
6197200	6204240	uncrackable encryption, hurrah.
6204240	6208200	So they're not really worried that anybody's going to crack this other than obviously this
6208200	6214880	research team, because really, who's sitting on 200 PS3s other than Sony?
6214880	6215880	Nobody.
6215880	6216880	Nobody.
6216880	6224080	There's all those other research labs, remember?
6224080	6227080	The ones that are actually trying to cure cancer?
6227080	6229560	Yeah, my PS3 cures cancer.
6229560	6230560	It's awesome.
6230560	6236000	Well, hey, I can't buy PS3 games at airports yet, but now you can buy, well, I guess I
6236000	6240440	might, but depending on the airport, I actually probably could, but now you can buy a Nintendo
6240440	6244440	DS and DS games in airports out of a vending machine.
6244440	6248160	Yeah, these vending machines are pretty high end, but you know, I guess we've seen these
6248160	6252120	types of vending machines before that have kind of the really uber expensive stuff.
6252120	6253120	Like I know they're in Vegas.
6253120	6254120	You see them, right?
6254120	6257720	Don't you see these things in Vegas, casinos and stuff, like iPods and all that stuff?
6257720	6264120	Well, now they have these fancy vending machines with expensive DS games and Nintendo DSs in
6264120	6265120	them.
6265120	6272060	Apparently, it's something that Best Buy is doing, and it's at a Best Buy Express vending
6272060	6273060	machine.
6273060	6276640	These things are at a couple of the different airports throughout the US.
6276640	6281240	Not only, though, should I point out that they sell the DS and DS games, they sell headphones,
6281240	6283420	chargers, and so on.
6283420	6286920	Now I want to point out, though, that if you've ever flown before, you'll know you actually
6286920	6289120	don't want to use the DS, though, during landing and take off.
6289120	6290120	It's bad.
6290120	6293960	And you could crash the plane and get- no, not really, but they'd get really angry at
6293960	6296680	you when you do that, so only use it when it's safe.
6296680	6300140	It's kind of neat that they have these sort of kiosks.
6300140	6302680	We did see one for Sony and stuff.
6302680	6308160	Unfortunately, there's also a chain of stores called- oh gosh, now I can't remember what
6308160	6309160	the name is.
6309160	6310160	Airtunes, right?
6310160	6315080	Not Airtunes, but it's- I don't remember what they're called anyways, but they have a chain
6315080	6318920	that's in every single airport that's out there right now, and they also sell the exact
6318920	6324480	same stuff, and in case you're worried about putting in your credit card and spending hundreds
6324480	6331400	of dollars on DS systems and stuff like that, and possibly getting stuck in this vending
6331400	6332400	machine-
6332400	6333400	That's what I was going to say.
6333400	6336400	What happens if the little thing turns and it doesn't fall out?
6336400	6339880	Can you imagine me sitting there shaking this vending machine with $100 worth of merchandise?
6339880	6342240	I'm sure there's alarms on it and all.
6342240	6349040	But you can actually go to the store and purchase these games face-to-face with people, so I
6349040	6352480	don't really see the point of why they have this in there, other than another place you
6352480	6353960	can buy the same shit.
6353960	6354960	Impulse Buy.
6354960	6356520	Mommy, I want one!
6356520	6358920	Gimme, gimme, gimme!
6358920	6361840	Leo Shen calls it a Super Plane Crasher DS.
6361840	6365880	Black Wolf says, now do the DS's come already charged, or do you have to charge it in the
6365880	6368000	airport before you get on the plane?
6368000	6371600	And Rama says his did come charged already.
6371600	6373880	Have the DS's come charged in the box?
6373880	6377960	From what I remember, my original DS, and I think my DS, I think I had to charge both
6377960	6378960	of those.
6378960	6379960	Did you?
6379960	6380960	Hahaha!
6380960	6381960	Sucks for them.
6381960	6385600	Yeah, because then how do you charge them before you get on the plane?
6385600	6390160	Of course, then, you know, airports, it's really easy to charge a laptop at an airport.
6390160	6391160	There's plugs everywhere.
6391160	6392880	Yeah, but you cannot have the convenience or time to do that.
6392880	6398120	And better yet, I mean, really, do you really want to buy electronics at an airport?
6398120	6401920	I mean, I can understand a game, you know, I bought headphones because my headphones
6401920	6407200	sucked because I had these stupid earbuds and I wanted something different, but, really,
6407200	6412000	a DS system, you're like, hey, you know, I really wish I had DS.
6412000	6416380	I think this is more for, like, gifts and stuff like that, like, crap, I gotta get my
6416380	6422040	son a gift, and I am stupid and didn't think about getting him anything.
6422040	6425920	Oh, hey, look, a vending machine, let me buy some useless crap.
6425920	6432160	Yeah, the problem is they also have porn in the airport, and that's very sad.
6432160	6435000	Well, because, you know, you shouldn't be looking at porn on a plane.
6435000	6437800	That's not going to crash a plane that does not interfere with their taking off or landing.
6437800	6439880	Yeah, but there might be children sitting behind you.
6439880	6441880	Screw the children.
6441880	6442880	No thank you.
6442880	6445600	Unless you're sitting in the very back row by yourself, then you can look at all the
6445600	6446600	porn you want.
6446600	6449840	Wait, wait, wait, if you get a, if you can, if they sell a PSP, you can look up porn on
6449840	6452960	the PSP, because we all know the PSP is a gateway to porn.
6452960	6457240	But you can't look at the internet while you're on a fucking airplane.
6457240	6462400	Ah, but you can put pictures and encode videos onto your memory.
6462400	6463400	All at the airport?
6463400	6466400	Yes, all at the airport.
6466400	6467400	Seriously.
6467400	6474520	If you're going to go to that extreme lengths of trouble just to look at porn, why don't
6474520	6476360	you just bring a Playboy on the goddamn plane?
6476360	6480000	And you know what else you could do, too, is use one of those TV devices that they had,
6480000	6485160	remember those wonderful TV devices that they don't sell anymore, that act like a projector,
6485160	6488440	and project it onto the ceiling of the cabin.
6488440	6490440	You have issues.
6490440	6492160	Alright.
6492160	6494840	Anyhow, let's move on.
6494840	6498680	We have one more story before we get to match game tonight.
6498680	6502720	Well, I like Legos.
6502720	6505080	And I like Rock Band.
6505080	6509640	And there's a rumor going around that those are two great tastes that taste great together.
6509640	6512480	Tastes great.
6512480	6513480	Less filling.
6513480	6514480	Tastes great.
6514480	6515480	Less...
6515480	6521800	So, yeah, the rumor is that there is going to be a Lego Rock Band.
6521800	6523880	That's all I can say.
6523880	6527800	There's no confirmation.
6527800	6530840	There's a...
6530840	6534320	Some dude's uncle works for Lego and heard, right?
6534320	6536880	There's supposed to be a Lego title coming out.
6536880	6542640	But Lego Rock Band, dude, can't they find something...
6542640	6544640	I guess it's not the dumbest rumor I've ever heard.
6544640	6548880	Wasn't there a White Stripes video made completely out of Legos, if I remember right?
6548880	6550120	I think.
6550120	6554200	That's the only thing I could think of that could possibly tie into Legos and Rock Band.
6554200	6555200	This is bunk.
6555200	6556200	It's gotta be bullshit.
6556200	6557200	It's gotta be.
6557200	6558360	And you know why this is completely bunk?
6558360	6562240	Is because you have to understand the way they make Lego games.
6562240	6566300	For example, it's a specific chain of events.
6566300	6572880	You have the toy that they make first, then you make the video game.
6572880	6577040	Just like they've had, you know, I believe they have the Lego Indiana Jones toys.
6577040	6579480	I know they have the Lego Star Wars toys.
6579480	6585200	I know that they have the Lego Racer toys and stuff like that.
6585200	6590980	So the next logical step for me, and seeing as that the rumor is EA is going to be publishing
6590980	6598320	it would be Lego Harry Potter, because, you know, they need another Lego game, and that
6598320	6603160	makes perfect sense for me that they would be able to pump out two more Lego games based
6603160	6607680	around the Harry Potter movies, and they already have toys to go along with it.
6607680	6613360	So Rock Band wouldn't make any sense at all because there's no reason for them to buy...
6613360	6618520	Why would you even want to, I mean, you'd have to make special peripherals for it.
6618520	6621080	There's no Lego themed music to go along with it.
6621080	6625660	It would just be like a reskin of Rock Band.
6625660	6628460	It would be kind of crap, is what it would be.
6628460	6633560	It would be not kind of crap, it would be totally crap.
6633560	6637120	Tiger Claw is suggesting Lego Transformers would be another logical step.
6637120	6638600	But see, they don't have a toy for that.
6638600	6642000	Remember it's toy, then game.
6642000	6645800	It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, the game.
6645800	6651240	Like they're not going to just all of a sudden make, you know, Lego Halo or something like
6651240	6652240	that.
6652240	6654280	Unless they make Lego Halo toys first.
6654280	6657800	It's toy in game, because Lego's not going to just put their license out there unless
6657800	6660540	they have something to benefit from it.
6660540	6662760	Now you know what this has started in the chat room.
6662760	6672080	Now we have Frisbee says Lego of Persia, Bricks of Time, GS68 says BeatMania 2DX Legos, GS68
6672080	6679640	says Imagine Legos, Drew, even though he's sitting right behind me, says Lego Crisis,
6679640	6684480	Lego International Superstar Soccer, Lego on a Prayer, Lego Sonic the Hedgehog, Little
6684480	6686960	Big Legos.
6686960	6693880	Anyhow, now that's a good question from Kazam is what about the Lego MMO?
6693880	6695960	That's a good question.
6695960	6697600	Orange Lego Radio?
6697600	6700480	Alright, forget it, cooking Legos.
6700480	6701480	Alright, forget it.
6701480	6702480	Enough.
6702480	6703480	Stop.
6703480	6705480	Knock it off.
6705480	6707680	We have something much better to look forward to.

6757960	6766120	Alright, and of course, also on the celebrity panel tonight, the most fabulous of them all,
6766120	6767120	me.
6767120	6770800	Alright, let's get to tonight's match game.
6770800	6776280	First off, we have nine people who caught my uber secret message in chat to send me
6776280	6783200	a tell to play, so if you wouldn't mind sauce, pick a number between one and nine.
6783200	6785200	Lucky number seven.
6785200	6788440	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
6788440	6792200	The seventh person to send me a tell tonight was X-Link.
6792200	6798920	So X-Link is going to play from chat.
6798920	6801600	And I'm telling him to please stand by.
6801600	6805360	We'll need to explain the rules for match game while I open up the Skype line to the
6805360	6811080	first person to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if
6811080	6816040	you want to play against X-Link for that $25 gift certificate.
6816040	6821800	Alright, somebody explain the rules of match game, hurry.
6821800	6822800	Dark Sakura.
6822800	6828440	We're reading a bunch of crap, and it ends, but it ends incomplete and you gotta complete
6828440	6829440	it.
6829440	6830440	With a word.
6830440	6831440	Or phrase.
6831440	6832440	Sorry, go ahead.
6832440	6840960	Like if I said, I went to the blank, you'd have to pick something.
6840960	6844960	And X-Link just told me he has no idea how to play, so this should be fun tonight.
6844960	6848200	You have to try and match what we are thinking.
6848200	6849960	Yes, you gotta match what we are thinking.
6849960	6853120	We're gonna send you something with a blank in it, and you tell me over private message
6853120	6854680	what you think should be in the blank.
6854680	6857520	Oh, and good luck.
6857520	6860880	Hurry up and go to YouTube and type in Match Game 76.
6860880	6863980	There's no time, there's no time.
6863980	6865320	We do have a caller on the Skype line.
6865320	6866680	Hi caller, who's this?
6866680	6870240	Hi, this is Ronma, aka DJ Ronma.
6870240	6871240	They're gonna say it's rigged.
6871240	6872240	They're gonna say it's rigged.
6872240	6878840	No way, he's got mad skills, and it's fitting he should be our first phone contestant of
6878840	6879840	the year.
6879840	6882360	He has a flaming finger when it comes to dialing.
6882360	6883360	So there you go.
6883360	6887160	Alright, now Ronma, do you know how to play Match Game?
6887160	6891480	Ronma, do you know how to play Match Game?
6891480	6893080	Why, yes I do.
6893080	6894800	Why yes you do, alright.
6894800	6899480	Can you explain X-Link how to play?
6899480	6906240	Damn it, I hosted a Match Game one time, I can't remember, oh god, I'm so sorry.
6906240	6907240	That's alright.
6907240	6909480	Fill in the blank with what you think we're gonna say.
6909480	6911480	That's the best way we can explain it.
6911480	6918560	Okay, so the winner tonight will get a $25 gift certificate to Amazon.com courtesy of
6918560	6921600	Avengers Tower, your favorite giggling game girl blog.
6921600	6924160	No, I shouldn't keep saying that because then people are gonna think that's really true,
6924160	6927840	but it's actually, it's irony because if you go read it, it's actually very well thought
6927840	6928940	out and very well done.
6928940	6931440	It's irony, it's a case of irony.
6931440	6937480	And the loser tonight gets their face melted off with an Xbox 360 laser gun, so don't lose.
6937480	6940040	Alright, sound good, Ronma?
6940040	6941040	Works for me.
6941040	6942040	Alright.
6942040	6947640	The whole chat room is yelling, rigged, rigged.
6947640	6952000	Do you have anything to say to the chat room before we begin tonight?
6952000	6956720	I'm sorry, I can't help but have the fastest internet connection in the chat.
6956720	6957720	Alright, oh snap.
6957720	6959160	Alright, here we go.
6959160	6960160	Question number one tonight.
6960160	6961200	Are you ready for question number one?
6961200	6964640	Now don't say the answer because we all have to write down here in studio and if you blurred
6964640	6969320	it out, then you automatically lose and get shot in the face with an Xbox 360 zapper,
6969320	6970320	okay?
6970320	6972480	Alright, so here is question number one tonight.
6972480	6977080	And XLink, you send me your answer over a private message.
6977080	6980820	Dark Sakura, as you know, no you're in the question.
6980820	6985440	Dark Sakura, as you know, doesn't like to sing in front of people.
6985440	6988940	She snubs SingStar and laughs at lips.
6988940	6995000	The whole reason for this is that she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing
6995000	7001840	For Your Blank.
7001840	7004600	Dark Sakura is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game.
7004600	7007640	It's called Sing For Your Blank.
7007640	7011960	Everyone here in studio is trying to cook up an answer and just say ding when you're
7011960	7015560	done so I know you have it.
7015560	7018240	Dark Sakura burped.
7018240	7022040	Okay, ding.
7022040	7023720	I changed my answer last minute.
7023720	7024720	Ah, ding.
7024720	7025720	Ding and Tiara?
7025720	7027080	Alright, Tiara, ding.
7027080	7030040	I'm just waiting for our chatroom contestant to give an answer.
7030040	7031720	Rama, do you know an answer yet?
7031720	7032720	Yes, I do.
7032720	7033720	Ding.
7033720	7034720	Alright.
7034720	7041480	I'm waiting on our chatroom contestant, XLink.
7041480	7044760	Can you send me something?
7044760	7045760	I just typed hurry.
7045760	7047360	Okay, there we go.
7047360	7049360	We have an answer.
7049360	7050880	Alright.
7050880	7053560	Sometimes it could be the obvious answer, sometimes it's not obvious.
7053560	7054560	Alright.
7054560	7057720	The whole reason for this is that she's waiting for an ultimate karaoke game called Sing For
7057720	7058720	Your...
7058720	7059720	Rama?
7059720	7060720	Sing For Your...
7060720	7061720	Alcohol.
7061720	7065300	Sing For Your Alcohol, says Rama.
7065300	7070120	Our chatter, XLink, says she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing For
7070120	7073120	Your Life, says the chatter.
7073120	7074320	Sing For Your Life.
7074320	7077720	Alright, DarkSakura, we'll start with you on this question.
7077720	7081480	Sing For Your...
7081480	7082680	We already have a match.
7082680	7083680	What is it?
7083680	7084680	I was gonna say booze.
7084680	7085680	Sing For Your Booze.
7085680	7088280	Oh my gosh, this game's super rigged tonight.
7088280	7090320	Rama already got a point.
7090320	7091720	Alright, well, let's see what happens.
7091720	7093400	Rama, you're on the board with a point.
7093400	7094400	Congratulations.
7094400	7095400	Sing For Your Booze.
7095400	7096400	We have a match.
7096400	7097400	Yay, match.
7097400	7098400	Yay.
7098400	7099400	That's amazing.
7099400	7102920	This is the first time in the history of this game, we matched on the very first answer
7102920	7107560	because we go through, we've gone through games and games where nobody ever matches
7107560	7109300	a goddamn thing.
7109300	7111120	This is epic match game tonight.
7111120	7114280	Sauce, she made a karaoke game called Sing For Your...
7114280	7117640	I think this will possibly count for a match.
7117640	7119600	I said Sing For Your Survival.
7119600	7122720	Please remove that shotgun from my head.
7122720	7124400	Sing For Your Survival.
7124400	7125400	Will we count it?
7125400	7126400	Yeah.
7126400	7128880	No, we're gonna count it as a match, yay.
7128880	7129960	So now it's tied up.
7129960	7131080	One for Rama.
7131080	7132080	One for X-Link.
7132080	7133080	Okay, Loki.
7133080	7134240	Sing For Your...
7134240	7135240	Life.
7135240	7136240	Oh!
7136240	7138280	X-Link pulls ahead with two.
7138280	7139280	Sing For Your Life.
7139280	7140280	Two to one.
7140280	7144840	I couldn't think of anything so, you know, that's the first thing that I came up with.
7144840	7145840	Alright.
7145840	7147320	Trying to be clever.
7147320	7148320	Drunami.
7148320	7149840	Sing For Your...
7149840	7150840	Guardian Legend Remake.
7150840	7152480	Guardian Legend Remake.
7152480	7155360	Oh, good, but not a match.
7155360	7157400	And I said, I don't think this is gonna be a match.
7157400	7160120	I said Sing For Your Child's Freedom.
7160120	7161120	Also...
7161120	7164360	Does Jamie really play that?
7164360	7165360	Well, it's...
7165360	7168800	I don't know if Jamie would play it, but like, I don't know, it would be something I could
7168800	7171200	see that they would have at Golf Land, so there you have it.
7171200	7173000	Sing For Your Child's Freedom.
7173000	7174000	Unfortunately not a match.
7174000	7176000	You alright there, Jamie?
7176000	7177000	Alright.
7177000	7178000	Dork.
7178000	7179040	Alright, here we go.
7179040	7182520	So it's X-Link 2, Rama 1.
7182520	7185600	Alright, so Rama, I don't know if it's rigged.
7185600	7186600	We'll see.
7186600	7187600	Oh, yeah.
7187600	7188600	Alright, Rama.
7188600	7189600	You have four.
7189600	7190600	It's an epic match game tonight.
7190600	7191680	There's four more chances to catch up.
7191680	7192960	Here we go.
7192960	7195080	Question number two.
7195080	7202040	Rob, hey, that's me, is planning early for this year's E3.
7202040	7206560	He already reserved his plane tickets and his tickets to the show.
7206560	7212240	When asked why he was going so early, he exclaimed, I'm just so excited to go back this year and
7212240	7214240	see all the blank.
7214240	7217240	Ding!
7217240	7233640	Oh, my gosh, you guys.
7233640	7261360	I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the booth babes.
7261360	7270360	booth babes says Rama. X-link says I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the games.
7270360	7277360	That seems like a pretty fucking obvious answer, right? Let's see, I don't know, let's see.
7277360	7284360	Did we go for the obvious or did we go for crazy? I don't know, let's see.
7284360	7288360	We'll start again with Dark Sakura. I can't wait to go and see all the...
7288360	7294360	Fanboy Wank. Fanboy Wank.
7294360	7297360	I don't think technically that's a match, I'm sorry.
7297360	7300360	Sauce, I can't wait to go back and see all the...
7300360	7305360	Previews for Sing Star Journey. Previews for Sing Star Journey.
7305360	7310360	I don't think that's a match with games. Games is too broad, but that's a good, that's a very good answer.
7310360	7312360	Very good, you know me very well.
7312360	7319360	Loki, he can't wait to go back and see the... This is totally opposite of what you'd probably say anyways, but I said...
7319360	7324360	All the Paris Hilton games. All the Paris Hilton games, ew.
7324360	7329360	Maybe in an alternate universe. Does that match with just games though? I don't, I don't think it does.
7329360	7332360	I'm sorry, sorry X-links, too, too, too broad.
7332360	7334360	Alright, uh...
7334360	7342360	Drewnami, can't wait to go back and see all the... Fucking ABBA music games. Fucking ABBA music games.
7342360	7344360	Alright, good answer, but not a match.
7344360	7348360	And I said, now this is going to be tricky, okay, here's what I said. I said...
7348360	7352360	Rob said, I can't wait to go back and see all the...
7352360	7357360	Military men, is what I said. But does that count for booth babes?
7357360	7360360	I think so. You think so?
7360360	7364360	Yeah. That's like a booth babe for me.
7364360	7367360	Yeah, babe can go either way.
7367360	7371360	Babe can go either way. Alright, Rama, we're going to give you a point for matching on that one.
7371360	7373360	Even though you got the wrong gender.
7373360	7376360	Woohoo!
7376360	7380360	Who cares about gender here on Orange Lounge Radio? Alright.
7380360	7382360	There we go, we gave him a point for that.
7382360	7387360	Alright, so it's all tied up and the chat room is complaining that it's rigged.
7387360	7390360	Hey, it's my gift card. I can tell if it counts or not.
7390360	7393360	That's right. There you go. Oh snap.
7393360	7397360	You just got, the chat room, you just got served by a giggling geek girl.
7397360	7399360	I just want to point out.
7399360	7403360	Alright. Anyhow, let's get to question number three.
7403360	7405360	And you know it's a Loki question.
7405360	7410360	Alright, here we go. Question number three in tonight's match game, epic match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7410360	7416360	Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.
7416360	7419360	He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.
7419360	7426360	They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.
7436360	7439360	Alright, Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.
7439360	7442360	He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.
7442360	7448360	They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.
7448360	7450360	I ding.
7456360	7458360	I'm going to ding.
7464360	7467360	Alright, Rama, did you ding?
7467360	7468360	Ding?
7468360	7469360	Alright, here we go.
7469360	7472360	Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.
7472360	7474360	He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.
7474360	7479360	They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of erotica.
7479360	7480360	Erotica.
7480360	7485360	Alright, and X-Link said, nude ladies.
7485360	7487360	So, it's almost the same thing.
7487360	7490360	So, this is just playing for points at this point, racking up the points.
7490360	7495360	So, Dark Sakura, you can't have pictures of big black cock.
7495360	7497360	Big black cock.
7497360	7500360	Not a match and erotica is too broad.
7500360	7501360	What?
7501360	7503360	Sorry, that's not a match.
7503360	7504360	Sorry, that's not a match.
7504360	7506360	Loki has firmly said that's not a match.
7506360	7509360	Alright, Tiara, you can't have pictures of?
7509360	7511360	Iraqi suicide babies.
7511360	7513360	Iraqi suicide babies.
7513360	7516360	That is actually the first thing I put down and I changed it.
7516360	7517360	That's amazing.
7517360	7519360	Alright, not a match.
7520360	7525360	But you know, if I am going to make a level, it will have Iraqi suicide babies in there.
7525360	7529360	Alright, Loki, you can't have pictures of?
7529360	7532360	Um, blood and tits.
7532360	7534360	That's what I put in mine.
7534360	7535360	Blood and tits.
7535360	7536360	Blood and tits.
7536360	7537360	That's fairly erotic.
7538360	7544360	But I feel like if we're going to give it to Rama, then we also need to give it to X-Link for nude ladies.
7544360	7546360	Alright, so why not? We'll give them both a point.
7546360	7547360	Why not?
7547360	7549360	Alright, yay, a point for everybody.
7549360	7551360	Yay, blood and tits.
7551360	7556360	Alright, Drew, you can't have pictures of?
7556360	7558360	Iraqi suicide babies.
7558360	7560360	Iraqi suicide babies.
7561360	7564360	And my answer was, you can't have pictures of?
7564360	7566360	Cylon occupied Caprica.
7566360	7568360	Because it's copyrighted.
7568360	7570360	See, I went from one OLR joke to another.
7570360	7571360	That's what I did.
7571360	7572360	There you go.
7572360	7575360	You can't have pictures of Cylon occupied Caprica.
7575360	7578360	But see, Iraqi suicide babies is not copyrighted.
7578360	7581360	But Cylon occupied Caprica is. That's why I changed it.
7581360	7583360	I'll put a fucking copyright on it.
7583360	7584360	Alright.
7585360	7586360	Alright.
7587360	7590360	I love some of the answers the chatroom came up with here.
7590360	7591360	This is great.
7591360	7593360	Two men kissing was one of them.
7593360	7597360	Uh, pictures of Sky's old public access show.
7597360	7598360	Tingle.
7598360	7600360	I didn't even think of that one. That's a great one.
7600360	7601360	Tingle penis.
7601360	7603360	Lego tingle.
7605360	7606360	I have judgement.
7606360	7607360	Alright, good job.
7607360	7608360	Alright.
7608360	7609360	We have more.
7610360	7612360	Rama, it's all tied up. How you feeling?
7612360	7614360	I feel the pressure's on me.
7614360	7615360	The pressure is fucking on.
7615360	7616360	Alright, here we go.
7616360	7619360	Question number four.
7619360	7621360	Now they're not about the host anymore.
7621360	7623360	This is gonna get out there a little bit.
7623360	7624360	Alright.
7624360	7629360	Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.
7629360	7631360	That's right, we're gonna be having a rave.
7631360	7637360	However, instead of a cuddle room, they'll have a blank room.
7652360	7656360	Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.
7656360	7661360	However, instead of a cuddle room, they'll have a blank room.
7667360	7668360	Ding.
7668360	7669360	Alright.
7671360	7672360	Rama, did you ding?
7672360	7673360	Ding.
7673360	7675360	Alright, I'm just waiting on our chatter.
7682360	7683360	Alright.
7683360	7684360	Oh my god.
7684360	7685360	Alright.
7685360	7686360	Wow.
7688360	7689360	That's what happens when the pressure's on.
7689360	7691360	I'll read his answer in a minute.
7691360	7692360	Alright.
7692360	7693360	Orange...
7693360	7694360	Wow.
7694360	7696360	What kind of raves do you think we have?
7696360	7700360	Alright, Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.
7700360	7704360	However, instead of a cuddle room, they will have a...
7704360	7705360	Pyramid Head room.
7705360	7707360	Pyramid Head room.
7707360	7709360	Alright, well maybe that's where this answer comes from.
7709360	7710360	What time is it?
7710360	7715360	X-Link says they will have a rape room.
7718360	7719360	Okay.
7720360	7723360	I know, that's why I gaffed in horror when I read the answer.
7723360	7728360	Well, let's see if Pyramid Head or rape, or preferably both, comes up.
7728360	7729360	So let's see.
7729360	7731360	Dark Sakura, they will have a...
7731360	7732360	Fanboy wank.
7732360	7734360	Fanboy wank room.
7735360	7738360	That almost is Pyramid Head, almost, but not quite.
7738360	7741360	Alright, Sauce, they will have a...
7741360	7742360	Drunken Booze room.
7742360	7745360	Drunken Booze room, of course you gotta have a drunk room.
7745360	7747360	I advocate this.
7747360	7750360	Alright, Loki, the OLR rave will have a...
7750360	7752360	Light switch rave room.
7752360	7754360	Light switch rave room.
7754360	7756360	That's a damn good answer, good job.
7756360	7758360	Drew, they will have a...
7758360	7760360	A champagne room.
7760360	7761360	A champagne room.
7761360	7764360	No, there's champagne in the champagne room.
7766360	7767360	You ass.
7767360	7768360	Alright.
7768360	7771360	And I said that they will have a...
7771360	7773360	Gun room.
7774360	7776360	Come on, cause you all have guns.
7776360	7778360	Of course there's gonna be a gun room.
7778360	7779360	Alright.
7780360	7781360	Still tied up, 3-3.
7781360	7783360	What the hell happens if we have a tie?
7783360	7784360	Oh shit.
7784360	7787360	We have to play all night long until the tie is broken.
7787360	7788360	It's like baseball.
7788360	7789360	Alright, here we go.
7789360	7790360	Shit.
7790360	7791360	Alright.
7791360	7794360	Alright.
7794360	7798360	Here we go with the last question tonight, which hopefully someone will match on.
7798360	7800360	Here we go.
7800360	7806360	Little did you know that Drew Nami is here tonight to steal your prize.
7806360	7812360	Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on blank.
7812360	7815360	Ding.
7815360	7818360	Little did you know that Drew is here tonight to steal your prize.
7818360	7824360	Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on blank.
7824360	7826360	Ding.
7828360	7830360	Ding.
7830360	7832360	Did you ding Dark Sock right in here?
7832360	7833360	I did.
7833360	7834360	Alright.
7834360	7835360	I think everybody's dinged.
7835360	7836360	I think I heard Rama ding.
7836360	7837360	That was quick.
7837360	7838360	Yep.
7838360	7843360	Alright.
7843360	7846360	Rama, little did you know that Drew is here tonight to steal your prize.
7846360	7850360	Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on...
7850360	7851360	Warcraft.
7851360	7853360	Warcraft.
7853360	7859360	And X-Link says he was planning on spending the gift card on porn.
7859360	7860360	Pornography.
7860360	7861360	Alright, let's see.
7861360	7864360	We got two pretty extreme different answers there.
7864360	7866360	This could make all the difference.
7866360	7867360	Dark Sakura.
7867360	7870360	He's spending the gift card on...
7870360	7871360	Porn.
7871360	7872360	Porn!
7872360	7875360	Ooh, X-Link pulls ahead, but it's not over yet.
7875360	7877360	It's not over yet.
7877360	7878360	Alright.
7878360	7880360	Sauce.
7880360	7884360	She said she couldn't use fanboy wank again.
7884360	7885360	Alright.
7885360	7889360	Sauce, he's gonna spend the gift card on...
7889360	7891360	I actually did say Warcraft.
7891360	7892360	Warcraft.
7892360	7894360	Oh man, it's tied again.
7894360	7896360	Oh man, it's back to 4-4.
7896360	7897360	Let's see.
7897360	7898360	Alright.
7898360	7899360	Amazing.
7899360	7900360	Alright, Loki.
7900360	7902360	He's gonna spend the gift card on...
7902360	7904360	I didn't say either of those.
7904360	7906360	I said Better Joke Books.
7906360	7907360	Better Joke Books.
7907360	7909360	Oh, he might need that.
7909360	7910360	Alright.
7910360	7912360	So, uh, Drew?
7912360	7914360	It's come down to you and me.
7914360	7915360	Maybe one of us matches.
7915360	7916360	He's gonna...
7916360	7917360	You want me to go first?
7917360	7918360	I think you should.
7918360	7919360	Alright, you think I should?
7919360	7923360	Alright, I said he's gonna spend his gift card on...
7923360	7925360	A life.
7925360	7926360	Boo.
7926360	7928360	But I put a heart next to it, so it's okay.
7928360	7929360	It's just a joke.
7929360	7931360	But he's gonna spend his gift card on actually getting a life.
7931360	7932360	I'm just kidding.
7932360	7933360	Love you, bro.
7933360	7934360	Alright.
7934360	7937360	Drew, he's gonna spend the gift card on...
7937360	7945360	Getting Kim to California, you fucking perverts.
7945360	7947360	So the match came in tonight in a tie.
7947360	7948360	What do we do in case of a tie?
7948360	7949360	Lie Radio.
7949360	7950360	Do we have to do another question?
7950360	7953360	No, I get the gift card just as planned.
7953360	7954360	No, no, Drew.
7954360	7955360	I'll do one, I'll do one, I'll do one.
7955360	7956360	You're gonna do one?
7956360	7957360	I'll do one, I'll do one.
7957360	7958360	Alright, one more question.
7958360	7959360	This is coming from...
7959360	7961360	Completely off the top of my head.
7961360	7962360	I'm a little worried about this one.
7962360	7965360	You have to talk fast, because I have to message it to X-Link, okay?
7965360	7966360	Okay.
7966360	7967360	Alright, go.
7967360	7973360	During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up
7973360	7977360	another question for match game.
7977360	7983360	So instead, they decided to settle the tie by a blank.
7983360	7994360	I repeat, if I can remember, during an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, they had a tie in
7994360	8000360	the match game, and they couldn't think up another question, so they had to solve the
8000360	8005360	tie by a blank.
8005360	8008360	Ding.
8008360	8011360	Ding.
8011360	8017360	I don't know, how do you guys get your answers so fast?
8017360	8023360	Because I did the obvious answer.
8023360	8029360	Don't be giving things away.
8029360	8031360	Just kidding, I didn't...
8031360	8032360	Just kidding.
8032360	8037360	I wouldn't say that, it's retarded.
8037360	8041360	God, I don't know.
8041360	8054360	Okay, I've typed out my answer, it's long and dramatic.
8054360	8058360	Alright, I'm waiting on X-Link.
8058360	8061360	During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up
8061360	8066360	another question for match game, so instead they decided to settle a tie by a blank.
8066360	8070360	Uh, which I'm waiting on X-Link still.
8070360	8078360	La la, la la, match game music, match game music, porn porn, blank blank.
8078360	8085360	I'm reading some of the comments in chat, they're pretty bad.
8085360	8086360	Butt sex battle?
8086360	8087360	Really?
8087360	8089360	Really?
8089360	8090360	Alright.
8090360	8092360	Come on!
8092360	8096360	It's by, uh, inflammation.
8096360	8099360	To see who's more inflamed.
8099360	8100360	Is he still in chat?
8100360	8102360	Or did we scare him off?
8102360	8106360	Are you there?
8106360	8108360	Do we have an answer?
8108360	8110360	I like what the Rob D says in chat.
8110360	8112360	The OLR match game wouldn't end, and DMN was spamming in chat.
8112360	8118360	Skye then said to DMN, you better stop that, you asspiper, or I'll blank.
8118360	8120360	Maybe that'll be the next question.
8120360	8121360	Who knows, we'll see.
8121360	8128360	Alright, if X-Link doesn't give me an answer in like 15 seconds, I am discounting his answer this round.
8128360	8130360	And Rama will have to match by himself.
8130360	8131360	So here we go.
8131360	8143360	15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
8143360	8144360	Oh, oh, oh!
8144360	8145360	There it is.
8145360	8146360	Happy New Year.
8146360	8147360	There it is.
8147360	8148360	Alright, finally.
8148360	8151360	Rama, during an episode of OLR, there was a tie and they couldn't think of another one.
8151360	8154360	So they decided to sell a tie by?
8154360	8157360	A fight to the flaming death.
8157360	8160360	A fight to the flaming death.
8160360	8170360	And X-Link said, a fight.
8170360	8175360	However, however, I think we might have a way to break the tie.
8175360	8176360	So, hold on.
8176360	8179360	Alright, so Dark Sakura.
8179360	8182360	They decided to settle the score by?
8182360	8183360	A fight to the finish.
8183360	8185360	A fight to the finish.
8185360	8188360	Alright, so that's a point for each.
8188360	8190360	Alright, Sauce.
8190360	8192360	They decided to settle the score by?
8192360	8193360	Sing Star ABBA Showdown.
8193360	8195360	Sing Star ABBA Showdown!
8195360	8197360	That's a fight to the death.
8197360	8198360	That's a wonderful answer.
8198360	8200360	Alright, Loki.
8200360	8203360	They decided to settle the score by?
8203360	8226240	her you know I just give Loki the gift card honestly I don't know why that's so
8226240	8235760	funny and I'm not even drunk all right well okay they decided to settle the
8235760	8247120	score by oh I'm sorry drew side so score by two men enter one man leaves this is
8247120	8250880	Thunderdome a fight to the finish all right so a point for each of them a
8250880	8258220	fight another fight okay here's the thing though here's my answer they
8258220	8263360	decided to settle the score by setting the studio on fire but please don't
8263360	8269680	actually do this but I'm thinking Rama did say a fight to the flaming finish so
8269680	8278080	it might match with Rama all right so you wanna we are we're still in a tie so
8278080	8283440	what happens does neither one win one more question oh this segment is getting
8283440	8289120	way too long read the one that the Rob D right we do Rob D's question all right
8289120	8292360	this is it I swear to God if we don't have a winner here then I don't know
8292360	8294360	we're just give it away next week or something I don't know what we're gonna
8294360	8308040	do here it is or we'll flip a damn coin says Brad okay we are
8308040	8312320	back on orange lounge radio I I think we're still here we had a little bit of
8312320	8316280	technical difficulty during the tiebreaker our very climatic tiebreaker
8316280	8322280	here on orange launch radio and our little table that houses the actual
8322280	8327380	mixing board and had some various items sitting on it actually buckled like the
8327380	8331880	damn thing just like all over if it fainted from the pressure of match game
8331880	8336600	apparently and it knocked our sound board over and it ended up pulling out
8336600	8341680	all the core that were in it and all that stuff so that's why the suddenly
8341680	8345920	the show went dead for those you guys that were listening live Frisbee says
8345920	8349640	don't edit this out of the podcast this part won't be but probably the minutes
8349640	8352680	and minutes long of silence will need to be because people will think their iPods
8352680	8359080	broke so there you go all right so who there you have it all right so we are
8359080	8364240	gonna try one more time to resolve this whole match game thing going on right
8364240	8371640	now oh yeah do we why we can't do the Rob D's question okay we'll do that all
8371640	8377560	right so we're gonna do the Rob D's question and this hopefully will fix
8377560	8383720	what's going on here and then we can get on with our lives all right here it is
8383720	8389240	last question for the match game night the olr match game wouldn't end in DMN
8389240	8393720	was spamming in chat sky then said to DMN you better stop that you asked Piper
8393720	8419560	or I'll blank ding ding did both ladies ding at the same oh wow that's hot all

8578240	8580720	more news to do and then we're gonna take a couple quick quick calls tonight
8580720	8583120	unfortunately got to keep it short tonight because we did not expect match
8583120	8585800	game to take so long I apologize for that but you know what it was a slow
8585800	8591680	news week so deal just deal okay deal Loki have some news haven't you ever
8591680	8595320	thought to yourself when playing a game of pinball gee I wish I could learn
8595320	8600880	about flatulence right now well now you can thanks to a custom pinball game
8600880	8609040	called gas attack that was part of a exhibit in gross ology apparently these
8609040	8615760	two exhibits or this part of the exhibit your pinball is actually bacteria and
8615760	8622400	you bump it into different foods that cause flatulence including meat onions
8622400	8631520	you name it and yes cabbage is on there brussel or brussel sprouts cheese all
8631520	8638280	sorts of stuff and they do have a picture of intestines right above it is
8638280	8645200	that the ramp no that's not the ramp the ramp there's actually a few clear ramps
8645200	8649000	that are in there but it has like a toilet and a bunch of other stuff on
8649000	8652720	there pretty basic looking but I get some message across I guess that is
8652720	8657480	something else that's amazing you know where yeah frisbee asked the question I
8657480	8664680	want to know where can I play this you know I'm not sure where this exhibits
8664680	8674720	actually at but it's yeah some gross ology exhibit that's touring so I will
8674720	8680440	find out gross ology that sounds pretty amazing all right I don't is this a
8680440	8683080	pinball game that you want to play dark soccer I mean you do play lots of
8683080	8688840	pinball games you want to play the fart game no I had to ask well I don't know
8688840	8693600	if this game is gonna be any better or worse but oh sorry real quick yeah you
8693600	8697960	can actually find out more about the gross ology tour by going to gross ology
8697960	8702800	tour calm and they have I think the dates that they'll be available well how
8702800	8708760	convenient all right well hey if that game doesn't sound like your your idea
8708760	8713320	of a good time maybe this one will be a little better it's push-up foo is a new
8713320	8717900	game that has come out for the iPhone it's a part of a series called the foo
8717900	8723680	apps like Shaq foo but this is called the push-up foo and apparently what this
8723680	8728680	is it uses the device's accelerometer to track how many push-ups you're doing and
8728680	8733140	give you feedback on how you're doing with your push-ups so that's kind of
8733140	8736620	interesting I guess I don't know if you put the thing on your back or something
8736620	8739160	or where you put this when you're doing your push-ups but I guess it actually
8739160	8742800	tracks how many push-ups you're doing and how well you've done but here's the
8742800	8747800	other cool thing push-up foo also lets you join a tracked league or you can go
8747800	8752220	head-to-head in what's called a battle mode apparently there's a course in it
8752220	8757460	that makes you it trains you to do a hundred and push-ups in it so that's
8757460	8761460	that's kind of an interesting use for the iPhone kind of like throwing a Wii
8761460	8767220	Fit angle into it or teaching you how to shake or tilt the iPhone into thinking
8767220	8771860	that you've done a hundred push-ups for real huh just like how you can shake the
8771860	8777220	remote it makes you think that her makes Wii Fit think you're jogging but you
8777220	8780500	know this might actually be kind of a fun competitive way like to do like if
8780500	8783860	you and your friends are doing it for like actual push-ups this might be kind
8783860	8787100	of a fun way to motivate people I don't know I hope they come out with other
8787100	8794620	versions of it we'll see gs68 says you put it in your pants I always put it in
8794620	8799680	my pants all right anyhow I don't know I it looks interesting if it's free I'll
8799680	8806660	check it out if it's not then I probably won't well I actually I I have this that
8806660	8813820	I'm reporting on next you can get game and watch games on your iPhone and I've
8813820	8823540	downloaded two of them basically they they're done a little differently but
8823540	8829220	they still really are the game and watch games you've got parachute chef fire and
8829220	8837140	octopus but they're called gw parachute gw chef gw fire gw octopus they're
8837140	8845500	dollar-99 and then wait till Nintendo hears about it yeah hurry before a
8845500	8850540	cease-and-desist gets sent it's pretty fun which will probably fire you better
8850540	8856460	get him now there you go you know I saw something on one of those gaming blogs I
8856460	8862500	was talking about an app that wasn't accepted into my apples app store there
8862500	8868420	apparently it was a booby shaking game that you can shake your iPhone in the
8868420	8874220	boob shake awesome and this wasn't accepted why because apparently it's
8874220	8883380	inappropriate for people I don't know whatever yeah whatever there is a new
8883380	8888820	exploit that's been found in the PSP you may remember before that they were doing
8888820	8894300	buffer overflows with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and I think before
8894300	8899860	that I can't remember whether games they were using to do that but now the newest
8899860	8905020	game to be able to do this is actually a very old game grip shift apparently
8905020	8909340	someone found an exploit in it where you can also do a similar buffer overflow
8909340	8916180	and it allows you to load modified save games which you can run all sorts of
8916180	8920460	homebrew programs but the most important thing about this is it works on the PSP
8920460	8927880	3000 and will eventually lead to custom firmwares on the PSP 3000 so try as you
8927880	8936500	may Sony it will never ever ever ever work so in other words they just need to
8936500	8940020	give up on patching it out they should just give up but hey you know they want
8940020	8944180	they don't think they kind of owe it to the people that you know and make games
8944180	8949740	for their system to yeah I guess whatever will never ever work well hey
8949740	8954220	Tomb Raider underworld if you're a fan of Tomb Raider underworld guess what you
8954220	8959300	can download the soundtrack for free that's right free what you can actually
8959300	8963020	choose you can choose some songs that are like associated with the game's
8963020	8967860	locals or you can get like a deluxe edition soundtrack that contains all 71
8967860	8974460	tracks 320 kbps mp3 formats so there you go all you have to do to get the
8974460	8979620	soundtrack it's a free download tomb Raider chronicles dot-com slash
8979620	8982780	underworld slash soundtrack dot HTML it's all there for download if you want
8982780	8987380	to check out some of the music from the game that's not too shabby that's
8987380	8992300	special who likes free stuff I know I do I don't like yours all right
8992300	8996100	oh yeah it's true how about some last-minute stories tonight do you have
8996100	9001780	any last-minute stories here is do F use we didn't do F use I didn't I neglected
9001780	9010260	to put it off you oh my gosh F me how horrible we should have put it in now
9010260	9012980	right after the table collapsed that would have been a good time to do it
9012980	9021300	all right all right let's get to the F use of the week then since I when I
9021300	9026380	forget to put in the F use in the show role I get pretty pissed off at myself
9026380	9049940	if you goes to be woken up from a deep sleep this morning to be bitched up
9049940	9062500	and the damn table sauce I'll try to keep it short but Ron Charles sent me a
9062500	9067220	Christmas card for Christmas obviously and when I received it the envelope had
9067220	9072460	been completely opened on three sides by someone else who obviously thought that
9072460	9079660	maybe there was games and prizes inside of some sort that F you to that person
9079660	9084940	who opened it and F you to my mailman who delivered it to the wrong place
9084940	9091620	Loki F you to myself for calling blizzards help line and threatening
9091620	9097380	suicide with them oh wait no I didn't do that that's right that's funny no F you
9097380	9101860	to not having as much money from my bonuses to waste on stupid shit like
9101860	9105740	more airsoft guns instead I did something responsible and actually put
9105740	9109020	it into a savings account but it's still pissing me off because I have the urge
9109020	9120580	to spend it on useless shit through F you to the card table F you to UPS being
9120580	9128820	unnaturally slow and bringing my new mouse or D 9 like 45 bucks last week
9128820	9134180	taking 10 days to get to my house right now it's sitting over the weekend in
9134180	9141740	West SAC 10 miles away when it should be you know on my desk also F you being
9141740	9146380	sick and sleeping all the time when you're sick
9147260	9150820	yeah I'm gonna have to echo some of what Drew said F you to being sick
9150820	9154020	especially the week before I'm supposed to go on vacation four days before I'm
9154020	9159060	supposed to go on vacation I'm getting sick God hates me also F you to people
9159060	9166060	named Alex no you're done okay F you Alex whoever you are all right anyhow
9166060	9169700	we're gonna open up the skype line for a little bit we'll take a couple calls
9169700	9173100	tonight again we ran a little long because the match came so we don't want
9173100	9175460	to go on all night long so we still have an afterbirth we got to get to because
9175460	9179380	we didn't do it after birth last week is oh boy oh boy just too much going on
9179380	9182460	here last hundred stories Oh last minute stories I'm sorry Loki do you have
9182460	9185300	something you want to get to yes real quick this is kind of a funny one why
9185300	9192380	wait we have EA is branching out into a new field of video games for them at
9192380	9199740	least they're tackling the love simulation market with a brand new game
9199740	9208420	that's actually a coming out in Japan it's a hot chill koi and it's a game
9208420	9214940	that features big-breasted women that you apparently rub tanning lotion on
9214940	9223380	nice nice all right let's see we are now on the skype line with a caller hi
9223380	9228140	caller who's this hi this is a spazzinator hi spazzinator what's on
9228140	9235700	your mind tonight um two things you know two things first of all I'm doing
9235700	9240580	something to you I managed to update my you know or you know replace my
9240580	9247420	PlayStation 3 it's not exactly the same models I had before but I'll take what I
9247420	9251860	can get that's right the ongoing saga of the stolen PlayStation 3 so unfortunately
9251860	9259180	it sounds like it was never found so but you got a replacement yeah and now I
9259180	9266060	just basically checked out home for the first time you know since I replaced my
9266060	9270780	PlayStation 3 and I I don't know you know I didn't know anything about but
9270780	9275820	you know what wasn't her supposed to be something in home there basically
9275820	9281580	allowed you to go into your like your pocket or whatever bring your friends
9281580	9286100	and be able to stream your music or videos and photos and stuff like that
9286100	9289900	yeah that was in the early beta but unfortunately it does not look like that
9289900	9293660	function has hit the finished product much like half of the other things that
9293660	9296540	Sony said was going to be in there such as the trophy cases you're gonna have
9296540	9299940	for all the trophies that you get in the games and you know a couple other things
9299940	9303700	I think they were probably a little worried as they should be about people
9303700	9309620	putting copyright content all over their house but I'll tell you that's the one
9309620	9313060	thing that's helping me from getting an OLR clubhouse I would put down the money
9313060	9317420	for an OLR clubhouse like that if I could somehow put in like any time like
9317420	9321260	even if I could just put like our podcast album art on the wall or
9321260	9326300	something cheesy like that I would do it like but I don't I think what they offer
9326300	9333460	right now is kind of dopey yeah in a way I can see what they're kind of
9333460	9339380	saying is not just for copyright stuff but you know how you know the media and
9339380	9345740	sharing other people whose names I won't mention like to get up and up all up in
9345740	9351260	arms about you know stupid things you know things now if they had you know
9351260	9355940	put the stringing stuff you know functionality to home you know someone
9355940	9361340	would've been stupid enough to like stream porn or whatever and then now
9361340	9366340	someone will kill see it and all of a sudden you know we'll be fucking off you
9366340	9373100	know get into the fire you know give those people ammo to sure us with enough
9373100	9376460	well I mean if somebody's gonna do something inappropriate they should just
9376460	9379180	simply be banned there should be a really really easy way to report and
9379180	9382620	ban those people you know that oh there already should be something set up
9382620	9385460	because there's already some craziness going on in home but I'll tell you my
9385460	9388460	favorite thing I've discovered to do in home I like to go in the movie theater
9388460	9391260	where the previews are playing especially when there's like one preview
9391260	9394900	playing over and over and over again and I like to go stand right in the middle
9394900	9400460	of the screen and dance that's my favorite yeah yeah I've seen people do
9400460	9404780	that already yeah it might have been me actually it was a guy wearing a green
9404780	9407700	shirt and jeans it was probably me because actually I turned it on on New
9407700	9410620	Year's Eve to show some friends what was all about and they wanted me to just
9410620	9414980	walk up to random people and start dancing in front of them so I don't know
9414980	9417660	all right anyway hey spazzing here we gotta let you go to get some more calls
9417660	9420900	but thanks for the call and congrats on getting a new ps3 and to have fun with
9420900	9426780	whatever you play on it sure thank you later dude and check out Prince of
9426780	9429700	Persia that's another game I'm playing more of lately that's a fun game I love
9429700	9433460	Prince of Persia because it's for dummies like me you can't die she always
9433460	9437740	freaking saves you the little little sidekick you roll with one eight seven
9437740	9445560	seven game olr another last-minute story Loki yes actually apparently GameStop is
9445560	9451580	no longer accepting Xbox game systems or accessories in trade effective February
9451580	9457140	9th even though more people are playing them than ps3 yes if you're playing them
9457140	9460980	you're certainly not playing them from GameStop now so hurry up and get them in
9460980	9469260	yes all right and then also Wii Sports is now the best-selling game of all time
9469260	9474660	it's even exceeded a Super Mario Brothers amazing hi you're on orange
9474660	9479420	launch radio who's this it's obviously you know who let's just talk to you
9479420	9483620	what's up no nothing much just celebrating you're just bringing in the
9483620	9489580	new year with mediocrity and just pull just a boring weekend generally yeah how
9489580	9495780	did you how did you celebrate what types of games did you play oh for New Year's
9495780	9501620	oh that's simple drunken Left 4 Dead after the ball drops nice oh that's one
9501620	9506020	of those things like I still or leading up to it but yeah definitely you know
9506020	9511420	playing Left 4 Dead in the dark with a with other people while like really
9511420	9516420	hammered up I'm worried that game will actually make me shit my pants that's
9516420	9520220	what I'm worried about that game it was it's nothing compared to like the other
9520220	9524380	classical movies like Dawn of the Dead although I'll be cool they had like a
9524380	9529740	mall map for Left 4 Dead either that authentic feeling but besides that it's
9529740	9533540	been that's the only excitement I had last week everything else afterwards has
9533540	9538660	just been you know ho hum yeah yeah money's tight so I don't have money to
9538660	9542300	go out I have might as well stay at home what are you looking forward to what are
9542300	9549260	you looking forward to most in 2009 uh well let me see besides digital life
9549260	9555060	hopefully coming back other other things you know III being open to the public
9555060	9559900	and all hopefully other companies not and not getting the ham not getting the
9559900	9566660	axe and generally just damn good games coming out I hope so I hope Sony could
9566660	9573020	definitely make it the year of the ps3 unlike the critics who's already already
9573020	9577580	said that you know I've already said that sort of thing last year and the
9577580	9581300	year before that and they were wrong it's gonna take something big but who
9581300	9586780	knows III could be could be this could be this is gonna be a big big year for
9586780	9591020	III with you I mean I'm going back in the public special though no I mean yeah
9591020	9595160	it's going back to the the circus you can expect that that is gonna be one
9595160	9600200	huge thing in 2009 III 2009 is gonna be bigger than any III in the past five
9600200	9606140	years okay either play as I you know as a boon for the ESA or it could be
9606140	9609860	another big clusterfuck like like the e3s of years past where you had like
9609860	9614900	booth babes just a lot of like you know a lot of game devs basically crunching
9614900	9618620	for that single demo that they're gonna end they're gonna showcase on e3 so it's
9618620	9624860	I don't know whether whether that's what the the effort to actually go back now
9624860	9629020	game guru in chat says III will bomb and no one will care we'll see I don't know
9629020	9633940	I disagree that's one I mean that's one opinion okay I guess if that person's
9633940	9637500	trying to be realistic given the state of the economy unless for some reason
9637500	9641700	the economy rebounds over the summer then you'll see a massive circus like

9817580	9820940	in a while that actually haven't worked I mean you guys are just playing the
9820940	9823740	match game you're knocking soundboards out the table yeah it's been a pretty
9823740	9828500	epic night um what's on your mind hey we had we had we have to ring in 2009 the
9828500	9833380	only way we know how exactly not too much well I I hear you didn't like HD
9833380	9836780	remix and I know that I'm a little bit late on the draw because you talked
9836780	9841700	about issues a couple weeks ago and uh I gotta say I'm pretty much in love with
9841700	9844780	the game so I was just calling it a disagree with you a little bit on that
9844780	9850180	try to contrast in view you know I just didn't find that there was I don't know
9850180	9853180	like Street Fighter 2 is one of those things I find that is better left in my
9853180	9857060	memory you know what I mean like it's just not something I think this is and
9857060	9859900	I've had time to reflect on what the hell is my big problem with is the game
9859900	9863540	anyway and I think honestly what it boils down to is that a lot of my
9863540	9868220	problem with the game has boiled down to the shift to Xbox Live and PlayStation
9868220	9871700	Network for these games and that it just doesn't have the same magic as it does
9871700	9875420	when you actually walk into an arcade and you get to shit talk someone like
9875420	9880440	right there in the you know that that's actually standing there next to you
9880440	9884180	because people say things online that they would not say to your face that's
9884180	9888260	one thing that I'm so I'm quickly learning about Xbox Live as for the game
9888260	9892460	itself I I hated the soundtrack that was my like number one bitch about the I know
9892460	9895860	I did I and I know they were trying to do the right thing by doing the fan
9895860	9899240	remixes and everything and don't even wrong I appreciate the gesture but the
9899240	9903140	soundtrack was hideous in my opinion. Oh the remix soundtrack not the original
9903140	9906540	soundtrack or do you just hate both? No I love the original. I do love the original
9906540	9910460	soundtrack. I don't like the remix one at all I don't like the remix one at all and
9910460	9915220	then I don't know that it just it just left me wanting more I felt like instead
9915220	9918500	of just kind of replacing the sprites it was going to be smoother but then I
9918500	9924140	realized I'm thinking of Street Fighter 4. I am desperately looking forward to
9924140	9926820	Street Fighter 4 as well I mean it's actually coming out on my birthday which
9926820	9932100	is kind of odd. Oh nice. Yeah I the thing is is that I like what Capcom did I do I
9932100	9934780	think it's great that they actually did go to the fans for the remixes which I
9934780	9937340	can understand why they'd be a little bit subjective especially if you liked
9937340	9941820	you know the the sound of the original songs and all. I did I really did like
9941820	9946660	the originals. It's great that Capcom actually did go to the guys at GGPO and
9946660	9950460	actually got their help with the netcode I mean the multiplayer for Street Fighter
9950460	9954460	2 is I don't want to call it flawless because there are a couple problems I
9954460	9958220	mean even then lag does pop up occasionally but I never thought they'd
9958220	9962780	actually be able to get a fighting game this good online and just actually seeing
9962780	9966060	this actually being able to play you know totient up in Canada or being able
9966060	9971820	to play even Shadow's Wire across in the UK with no lag or very negligible lag is
9971820	9976460	it blows my mind frankly. It's like I'm literally playing them in the arcade
9976460	9980620	right uh right next to them as far as the lag goes. Maybe I need to play
9980620	9985140	against more like real people I know and not random people because I played this
9985140	9987020	all at a friend's house because I actually don't even own the game I
9987020	9991700	actually played on PlayStation 3 so but yeah it's just I don't know and oh god
9991700	9996340	the Xbox 360 controller still is such an issue like I feel like if I did get the
9996340	9999260	game I'd have to get it on PlayStation 3 and even then I don't I don't know a lot
9999260	10004420	of people on there. Yeah I've been enjoying actually playing a few people
10004420	10007700	from the all-games community in the OLR community over an HD remix so that
10007700	10011300	hasn't been so much of a problem for me. It's been a learning curve to actually
10011300	10015900	get used to the controller the d-pad is leaving calluses on my thumbs frankly
10015900	10018740	and I've had to use the control stick for anyone who's not a Shotokan
10018740	10023220	character. Do we have a lot of OLR people that play Left 4 Dead on PC? I know
10023220	10025740	this is a completely random topic but I'm kind of curious because I'm actually
10025740	10029900	thinking about getting Left 4 Dead but on PC not uh not 360 just because I
10029900	10033660	first-person shooters I think I could do better on PC than I can on the 360. I
10033660	10037540	just want to throw that out there. What you can do is join the Steam community
10037540	10040780	Orange Launch Radio does have a Steam community. Is there actually people that
10040780	10045020	are still using it? Yeah I'm on it. Interesting all right maybe I'll have to
10045020	10047100	play Left 4 Dead sometime because I think I'm gonna pick that up sooner
10047100	10051140	than later. So anyway sorry didn't mean to didn't mean to just rail what Rob D
10051140	10054460	had originally called in about. Yeah you know I noticed the fighting game fans
10054460	10057660	especially really are in love with HD remakes and maybe I didn't give it a
10057660	10061440	fair look but I don't know it just didn't it didn't it didn't resonate the
10061440	10064980	way with me that it did the rest of you. I guess maybe my I was just so hyped up
10064980	10068460	for it to be this like new and something like so different but it was just kind
10068460	10072580	of like I don't know like it just felt like a letdown to me I it's hard to
10072580	10075460	explain. I'm looking forward to Street Fighter 4 as well and if they actually
10075460	10078140	get the netcode half as good on that game as they did in Street Fighter HD
10078140	10081380	remakes I'll be happy so. I will say that I'm definitely looking forward to Street
10081380	10084340	Fighter 4 as well I will definitely pick that up when it comes out so we will
10084340	10087340	have that to battle on if nothing else. And nothing will match the magic of
10087340	10091300	actually playing someone in an arcade right next to them you know the
10091300	10094980	shadiness of the arcade aside because let's face it not some some arcades
10094980	10100220	are better left to our memories rather than to our current sense of
10100220	10105300	smell today. Yeah good point good point. All right well Rob D I gotta let you
10105300	10108660	go so we wrap up the show but thank you so much for your call and have fun
10108660	10112500	battling the fellow listeners online. That's great to do. Act after you're going
10112500	10116860	down. See you later. Later. I guess they're already setting up a battle after the
10116860	10119520	show. That's one of the great things about doing a radio show like Orange
10119520	10123220	Lounge Radio. So you know we are moving into 2009 which if you can believe it
10123220	10128540	we started this show in 2002 so now this is our seventh year of broadcasting if
10128540	10133140	you can believe it and it's really neat to see the community that's kind of
10133140	10136380	built up and that people kind of do this stuff that makes it what we do here like
10136380	10142940	so worthwhile. Car tables being knocked over and all. Speaking of which yes got a
10142940	10146460	message from Rama with all the people who chipped in on that whiteboard for
10146460	10151260	you guys. Yes I I was seeing some stuff in chat what is going on I thought that
10151260	10155420	this was just something Rama got from his connections or something that is
10155420	10161900	work. We pooled our money together. Shut up. Me, Rama, Misty, SSJ 100 Matt, and Alpha
10161900	10166300	Kinanagram all pitched in to get you the whiteboard. That is so awesome. Well
10166300	10170780	thank you guys so much for that. That is great. I hope you get some use out of it.
10170780	10173700	We will. Well I'm probably gonna do I'm probably gonna rearrange this. We're
10173700	10177540	gonna have a week down. I'm gonna be on vacation so not only am I going you know
10177540	10181340	off out of the state for a few days but I'm gonna be just taking a couple extra
10181340	10184340	days off work. I'm probably gonna try and rearrange some things in here so probably
10184340	10187140	what I'm gonna do instead of hanging the whiteboard up I'll probably move all
10187140	10190020	these stuffed animals you see back here and have the whiteboard resting there
10190020	10193900	and move some things around so that way it's easily accessible too and that the
10193900	10197100	whiteboard won't get knocked over if I do try to mount it so but we will
10197100	10199420	definitely make use out of it and that'll be something fun for the Justin
10199420	10203120	TV listeners because hopefully we will have a webcam when we come back in two
10203120	10206900	weeks here on this show so it's almost like a whole new show not really though
10206900	10211980	just some new toys some new toys for an old and aging and practically dead show
10211980	10218380	hey like Benny Hill right we're old and dead all right all right so hopefully
10218380	10223740	far from decrepit trust me JTV I will stop at nothing to get JTV back next
