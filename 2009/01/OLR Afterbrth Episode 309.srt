1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:01,120
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to do much of an afterbirth tonight because the show went on so long.

3
00:00:04,684 --> 00:00:09,730
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having stream problems, and I think I have a cage match pick from Jamie, but I'm not sure.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,694
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to say screw it and kind of move quickly tonight.

5
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:19,182
[SPEAKER_00]: But Victoria did walk back in studio, so I wanted to give her a chance to say any last things she wants to say to the listeners.

6
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun being on the show.

7
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:29,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's been trying to get me to come on the show for a while.

8
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:33,254
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

9
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:36,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never really tuned in to listen.

10
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,518
[SPEAKER_00]: How nerdy is this, seriously?

11
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:39,238
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

12
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:40,479
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a nerd factor.

13
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,540
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got deeper into the nerd forest, my friend.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we'll have a camera next time?

15
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:46,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we should have a camera next show.

16
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:49,045
[SPEAKER_00]: We got sent one from one of our listeners.

17
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:49,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, thank you.

18
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:53,207
[SPEAKER_00]: AkumaJP, I believe, was the one that sent it.

19
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And DarkSakura has it, though.

20
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:56,489
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to bring it with her next week.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,713
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping... I mean, they're going to leave us... Like I said, I'm checking out the game Scratch this week.

22
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're leaving us a... It's...

23
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,608
[SPEAKER_01]: A presentation deck.

24
00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:12,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the DJ deck, but I think it's missing all the internals out of it.

25
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:14,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they wouldn't give me the actual deck.

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,730
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be kind of generous of them.

27
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:23,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm able to bring that in, but I may if I can.

28
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:24,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be sweet.

29
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:25,632
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't care.

30
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:29,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

31
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:32,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I did kind of get a headache from all the nerdiness.

32
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:32,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

33
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:33,773
[SPEAKER_06]: You suck.

34
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:35,543
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I love you.

35
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:37,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is fun.

36
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:39,245
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I got to hang out with Irene and Matt some more.

37
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:41,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

38
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:43,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for letting me be on your show.

39
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:44,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Muchas gracias.

40
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:45,530
[SPEAKER_00]: De nada.

41
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,250
[SPEAKER_06]: All that.

42
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:46,931
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this.

43
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:48,772
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't believe we've done this almost seven years now.

44
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:49,833
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no life, my friend.

45
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,434
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first night we ever did this.

46
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:52,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how many people listened?

47
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:52,875
[SPEAKER_00]: How many?

48
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:53,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve.

49
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:54,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

50
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:55,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve people.

51
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:56,578
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's not.

52
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:57,158
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably have.

53
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,208
[SPEAKER_00]: about 70 that listen live now.

54
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's more than 12.

55
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I mean now thanks to the podcast we have hundreds.

56
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Or two weeks ago we would have done it tonight.

57
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I be Brett?

58
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,732
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be anybody you want, but two weeks ago we did Video Game Match Game and you missed it.

59
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:22,032
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to really know anything about video games though.

60
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:22,993
[SPEAKER_00]: People say random shit.

61
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:23,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fun.

62
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:24,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you love Match Game.

63
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:26,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love Match Game.

64
00:02:26,574 --> 00:02:29,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob and I are going to be Brett Summers and Charles Nelson Reilly for Halloween.

65
00:02:29,715 --> 00:02:31,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's your Halloween costume this year.

66
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:31,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Be awesome.

67
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:34,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so there's no cage match tonight.

68
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to say.

69
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:36,139
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta wrap up.

70
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:37,440
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's already almost 10 o'clock.

71
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on air four hours.

72
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,701
[SPEAKER_00]: The podcast is gonna be huge this week.

73
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,642
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over three hours.

74
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've had one clock past three hours in a long time.

75
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:44,465
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a fun time.

76
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:45,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys very much.

77
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:46,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, guys.

78
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a fortune cookie message of the day for you all.

79
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.

80
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it say go fuck yourself?

81
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:52,731
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

82
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the fortune cookie message of the day.

83
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:21,877
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

84
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:23,738
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it for my fortune key message of the day.

85
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Syphil and Ollie show.

86
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:26,699
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.

87
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:27,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it.

88
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:28,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say Romy and Michelle?

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,280
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted me to do the Romy and Michelle?

90
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we'll do two fortune cookie messages today just because I love you that much.

91
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:37,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love this.

92
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:38,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you that much.

93
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:42,137
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I posted this in my live journal and I said... You were watching Romeo and Michelle yesterday.

94
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:45,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I said, I don't know why, but this clip just seems to sum up my life.

95
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:46,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it is.

96
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:54,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

97
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:54,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

98
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, um, great suit.

99
00:03:58,353 --> 00:03:59,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an Armani?

100
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:00,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes it is.

101
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:01,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought so.

102
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:03,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do?

103
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:05,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a suit salesman.

104
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:08,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you excuse me?

105
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:12,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut my foot before and my shoe is filling up with blood.

106
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:17,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Be funny.

107
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:17,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

108
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,354
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually watch it because of the limp she has as she walks away.

109
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,735
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crappy.

110
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody.

111
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:26,119
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.

112
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,140
[SPEAKER_06]: We're pulling the plug.

113
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,780
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

114
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:28,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye, guys.

115
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,042
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of here.

116
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:30,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see you next week.

117
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:32,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Same bat time, same bat channel.

118
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:32,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie will be back.

119
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:33,967
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more.

120
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Another friend of mine wants to come on the show.

121
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,330
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.

122
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt.

123
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,231
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

124
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,093
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that was here for New Year's.

125
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,117
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to come talk about PC games.

126
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:45,579
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have that.

127
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,901
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be fun.

128
00:04:48,182 --> 00:04:49,284
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be cool.

129
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:49,644
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

130
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:50,225
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done.

131
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:50,786
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out of here.

132
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:52,007
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next week.

133
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:52,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

134
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

135
00:06:13,496 --> 00:06:19,566
[SPEAKER_06]: All Games Radio is currently switching between our station and our live feed, which may take several moments.

136
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:20,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Please stay tuned.
