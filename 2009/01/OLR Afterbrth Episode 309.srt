1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
All right

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,740
And we're not gonna do much of an after-birth tonight because the show went on so long or having stream problems

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,000
And and I don't I think I have a cage match pick from Jamie

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,620
But I'm not sure so we're just gonna say screw it and kind of move quickly tonight

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,620
But Victoria did walk back in studio

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,120
So I wanted to give her a chance to say any last things she wants to say to the listeners

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,160
It was fun

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Being on the show I Rob's been

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,840
Trying to get me to come on the show for a you know be on the show for a while and

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Yeah, it was just it was fun. I've never really never really tuned in to listen

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,440
How nerdy is this seriously it is like your nerd factor? You just got deeper into the nerd forest my friend

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,920
Do you think we'll have a?

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,040
Camera next yes, we should have a camera next show we got sent one from one of our listeners. Thank you. Thank you one law

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,320
and Akuma JP I believe was one to send it and

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,680
Dark Sakura has it though. She's gonna bring it with her next week. I'm hoping I mean they're gonna leave us

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,160
like I said, I'm checking out of the game scratch this week, and they're leaving us a

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,780
it's a

18
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,000
presentation

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,020
Deck it's basically the DJ deck, but I think it's missing all the internals out of it

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,560
So you know cuz they wouldn't give me the actual deck that would be kind of

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:23,440
a generous of them no, but yeah, so I don't know if I'm able to bring that in but it may if I can

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
I'll be sweet. They don't care

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,600
All right, so yeah, it's just been it was fun. I did kind of get a headache from all the nerdiness. I'm sorry

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,200
But you know I love you, and this is fun. I've you know I got to hang out with Irene and Matt some more

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,160
So yeah, thanks for letting me be on your show muchas gracias, and you know all that

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,700
We've done this you can't believe we've done this almost seven years now

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,720
We did video game match game, and you missed it. You don't have to really know anything about video game

33
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,920
So people say random shit, and I know you love match game

34
