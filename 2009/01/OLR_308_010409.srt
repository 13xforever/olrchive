2
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,240

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:32,400
your old hdvd player into a burning laser?

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,380
Hi everybody and welcome to another week of orange lounge radio.

5
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,360
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
lifestyle.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,920
I should say welcome to a new year of orange lounge radio because you know haha it is 2009,

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,360
our first show of the year.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,600
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you tonight.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,480
As always, my faithful co-hosts, partners in crime, say hello to the one and only dark

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,960
sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Snorlax.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
How are you Snorlax?

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Hey.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Hey.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm doing okay.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,920
You know I was having a conversation about Pokemon and WoW the other day, don't ask,

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,160
but have you ever seen the Pokemon Jynx?

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
No.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,920
Jynx looks like a giant drag queen, google it, google Jynx Pokemon, it's hilarious, anyway

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,280
sorry I'm completely random like the rest of the show.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,440
Say hello to our very own drag queen here in studio, Techmaster Loki.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm sorry you must be talking about Andrew right here.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm sorry I was just imagining you dressed as Tingle because it's seemingly never going

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,640
to happen so I just have to imagine it.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Alright.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
How are you?

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,920
I'm doing fine, it could be better if this would work correctly.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,560
Oh yeah I forgot you have a cam over there, god pointed at my worst possible angle.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
It's not working.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Oh that's good.

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,200
Because you know like all things Sony it crashes out there a few minutes.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,240
So yeah.

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,840
Trying to use the Eye of Judgment for something useful and failing failtastically.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,760
Well yeah it failed just as fast as the Eye of Judgment within about five minutes.

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Gotcha.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Amazing.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,840
Also joining us tonight we do have some guests in studio as Loki already mentioned we have

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,760
the OLR forever intern Drew is here in house and we'll have to steal Loki's microphone

40
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
to be heard.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
What's up?

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Hi how are you?

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Not bad not bad.

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Cool cool.

45
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
How was your new year?

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,960
Pretty quiet.

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,680
Champagne got to see how Dick Clark's progressed.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
That's about it.

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Yeah not good.

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
Not good apparently.

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
Prognosis?

52
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
I'm a little sad about that.

53
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
You old.

54
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Yeah.

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Alright.

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,780
Also joining us tonight all the way from the city that never sleeps Las Vegas say hello

57
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:47,880
to T-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-A-R-R-A-R-R-R-A-R-R-A also known as Sauce.

58
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
How are you Sauce?

59
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
I'm doing pretty good.

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
How's Vegas?

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,040
It's Vegas like it snowed a couple of weeks ago and everybody freaked out.

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,320
It doesn't snow in the desert like ever.

63
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Fun times.

64
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,160
Yeah but you're spending the week in Sacramento?

65
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,740
Yeah this is actually my last night here.

66
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,740
Nooo.

67
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,740
Well how was your new year's?

68
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,980
It was fun.

69
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,360
We play a lot of rock band.

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,880
Yeah good times.

71
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,800
Now you're at a website now where you talk about all sorts of nerdy things, so you actually

72
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,520
have something to plug tonight, so why don't you plug away?

73
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,480
Well, I have a game slash comic slash book slash other geeky nerdy stuff.

74
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,600
It's a nerd blog.

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
It's a total nerd.

76
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
Anything nerdy, it's there.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,600
It's AvengersTower.com, and actually Jamie made an account on there too, and she's posted

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,760
a review on some comics.

80
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,800
So it's just kind of a fun place for all of your nerdy stuff to kind of converge together,

81
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,600
and you'll probably occasionally see references to that one episode of Star Trek The Next

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Generation where...

83
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Nice.

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Very nice.

85
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,560
Well, best of luck with the blog, and if you want to see two cute nerdy girls giggling

86
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,660
and screaming about comics and things, no, I'm just kidding.

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,660
It's a fun read.

88
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,660
You guys are very good writers.

89
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
Thank you.

90
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Good luck with that.

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,120
It's probably even better than Orangenolenceradio.com, so definitely check it out.

92
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
All right.

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,480
Let's start off with how is your gaming week?

94
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,200
So Dark Soccer, since you're all big time writing for a big giggling girl blog now,

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,560
why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Giggling Geek Girl.

97
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
I like that.

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
No, I'm just kidding.

99
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
No.

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,440
I played, of course, Rock Band on New Year's Eve, and that crappy Lips game that was full

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,080
of crap and crappiness and songs that I hate.

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,320
See, I would have thought Lips was awesome because it's by the Elite Beat Agents people,

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,600
but you were not a fan.

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,500
It has a bunch of pop bullshit that I hate.

105
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,120
As in, when I went in the room and had to ask, what is this and who is that, then that's

106
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,760
a sign that it's stuff that I don't listen to.

107
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,600
You made me play Sing Star Abba today.

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,480
Yes, it was amazing.

109
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,200
The girls came over before tonight's show, and we sat down with some Sing Star Abba.

110
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,720
It was epic, as Abba would be.

111
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Here's the thing about Dark Soccer, though, is that she does this whole, oh, I don't sing

112
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
in front of people.

113
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
I don't like to sing.

114
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,680
I don't really want to play.

115
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,320
So Tiara and I basically put a gun to her head and said, look, you're going to sing

116
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,520
or else, and she said, oh, okay.

117
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,720
She got up there and sang, got a higher score than Tiara and I. Probably combined, she got

118
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
a higher score.

119
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,480
I think she got 8,500 on the Take On Me song or something.

120
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
I don't know.

121
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,080
On her first song, she got 8,000 on whatever Abba song she was singing, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme.

122
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,920
She's totally one of those people that's like, oh, no, I couldn't possibly, and then she's

123
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
like, oh, my God, she's amazing.

124
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
No, it's okay.

125
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,520
This is the thing, and I'm sure I've explained this before, I hate hearing out of tune, and

126
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,720
I hear myself out of tune, and it drives me nuts.

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,160
And I think everyone else can hear it because I hear it, so I don't really want to do it.

128
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,320
And singing in front of people has been ruined for me forever because of church choir.

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
I see.

130
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,660
Well, so that explains then why we're shy, and at least you can change the mic volume

131
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,660
in SimStar.

132
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,660
Yeah, that was helpful.

133
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,720
It's just because I didn't want to hear myself that loud, but I played other stuff.

134
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,160
I actually turned on Order of Ecclesia and then turned it off because that was when Becky

135
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,180
arrived because I was just starting to play, and then it's like, oh, hi.

136
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,940
So we watched Eddie Izzard, and then we played a whole crap ton of Marvel Ultimate Alliance,

137
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,520
and by a whole crap ton, I mean a whole crap ton.

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:45,640
It was fantastic for, um, sorry, hee hee hee hee hee.

139
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,040
What the hell else did I play?

140
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,080
I gotta go to chat room because leave it to chat room to make some tee hee type comments.

141
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,680
Chat.orangeontrader.com, the ever-present extra guest on the program.

142
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,160
Black Wolf, our buddy, who is on right before us at allgames.com, and I should work in this

143
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
plug for him.

144
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,640
He's starting a new project next week on Friday.

145
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,000
It's Friday Night Gaming, FNG, that effing show.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,880
Now I can actually call it that effing show, and he can't get mad at me.

147
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,420
It's FNG, fnglive.net, and he has a comment tonight.

148
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,280
He says, the game obviously didn't hear you sing out of tune, because that's right, you

149
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
got a high score.

150
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,960
Obviously you weren't out of tune because the game didn't grade you out of tune.

151
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Just had to say that.

152
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,760
Well, yeah, okay, but it's...

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,160
It's probably forgiving, so she has another reason to be self-deprecating.

154
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Thank you!

155
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,680
I want ice cream now.

156
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Anyway.

157
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,880
Let's all go out for ice cream after the show.

158
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Actually they brought ice cream.

159
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Yeah.

160
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Damn.

161
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
But, um, but, I, um, what else, what else the heck did I play?

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Oh yeah, I was starting to play more Ragnarok, and then I was like, damn this intro's long!

163
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,360
So um, I'm still on the, uh, opening part of the game where they do a whole shit ton

164
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
of talking.

165
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,280
And um, um, um, um, I played something else.

166
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh yeah!

167
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,080
Big Buck Safari.

168
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,120
We went- What?

169
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,720
We were waiting on our food at, um, the Beach Hut Deli that, um, well I don't wanna...

170
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Well, they're great.

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,440
It's up on, on, uh, was it on Madison up there?

172
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
On Greenback?

173
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Wherever?

174
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,720
Anyway, um, we were waiting on our food, and I was like, I wanna shoot an elephant!

175
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,400
So, cause it was the tropical one.

176
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,480
So I got up there, and, and, thank you for the 50 cents by the way, and um, I, there,

177
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,120
you couldn't shoot elephants to start, so I picked a wildebeest, and kept, you know,

178
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
wanting to shoot the wildebeests.

179
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,880
But they were stupid, and it's like, if you shoot, you can only shoot the buck, you can't

180
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
shoot the cow.

181
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,320
I said, you shot a cow, moo!

182
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,000
But I shot a lion in the ass.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,960
I like nipped his ear, and he turned and ran, so I shot him in the ass.

184
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,160
And then I shot an elephant in the head.

185
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
Even though I wasn't supposed to shoot the elephant.

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,920
This is what Africa should be.

187
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,800
That's what I said!

188
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,400
I was like, this game is what Africa needs to be, only it was kinda craptastic, but it

189
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
was pretty funny.

190
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,800
And, you know, I just wanna remind people that all these Safari games we play, they're

191
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,360
all crap compared to Jambo Safari, honestly, when all's said and done.

192
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Jambo Safari is great.

193
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,200
Yes, Jambo Safari is one of those amazing, great games that we'll never shut up about

194
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,440
Like file it under, like, Guardian Legend and SingStar Abba, because it's right up there.

196
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,720
And then, um, I, I, our Turbo Express is low on battery, and we need to do batteries for

197
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,360
it, but I really wanted to play R-Type on, uh, earlier in the week.

198
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,760
I didn't get to play R-Type, but, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh, but, I did get, I told you I got Katamari

199
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,960
for my iPhone, and I played some.

200
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,080
Is this fail-tastic, as a lot of people were saying, or did they really fix it?

201
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,520
I heard they fixed some stuff.

202
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,540
It's still kinda hard to control, I haven't done story mode yet, I've just been doing

203
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,720
endless to get used to the controls.

204
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,880
I don't like tilting it, I wish that I could just, you know, slide my thumb in one direction

205
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,360
and have the, the Katamari go that way, but, it's alright, it's not bad.

206
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
It actually, I can't really notice a lot of the framerate problems that people were talking

207
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,520
about, because the, um, first one kind of had a few of those on its own, so it really

208
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,160
isn't all that big of a deal, it's an iPhone app, deal with it, shit.

209
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,120
You know, you wanna play Katamari that doesn't have that problem, freakin' get a PS2.

210
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:40,760
Alright, I like that review, it's an iPhone app, shit, deal with it, alright.

211
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Let's move on.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm gonna type that up right now.

213
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,280
You do that, put that in the Giggling Girl blog, alright, just kidding, alright, let's

214
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,540
move on over to Loki, Loki, how was your gaming week?

215
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:58,420
My gaming week was okay, um, I played a lot, well I tried playing some Grand Theft Auto

216
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:05,760
on PC, Grand Theft Auto IV, and for some reason, you know, I was trying to get some of the

217
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,880
mods to work in, it just doesn't like doing mods or something, even though I'm not really

218
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,120
changing much, it's just being retarded, so that's kind of annoying, but I did get, like,

219
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,720
some of the, um, no gravity stuff to work, but I was trying to do some really fun stuff

220
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,120
with it, but, oh well.

221
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:28,720
And then, um, you know, Grand Theft Auto IV on the 360 as well, still playing our, um,

222
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,280
daily games, and I actually tried some new XNA games, uh, one though I really liked was

223
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,680
uh, Carnivale, and I can't remember the rest of the title for that, but uh, Carnivale,

224
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,120
um, it's a really weird kind of game, you play like, Carnivale Showtime, yes, Carnivale

225
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:58,160
Showtime, it's, um, you play like this, um, acrobat, who's not really human, and you go

226
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:06,780
around popping balloons, but, they aren't really balloons, yes, sorry, never mind, except

227
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,520
they aren't really balloons, okay, um, no, but you actually, they have these little devices

228
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,920
that swing you around stuff, and the whole goal of it is to pop all the balloons and

229
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,480
get up to, um, the top of the screen where there's a flaming ring.

230
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,040
Now it sounds simple enough, but it keeps getting more and more progressively harder,

231
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,960
and there's other things that are added into it, like rockets and electrical stuff, um,

232
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,120
but for an XNA game it's actually extremely excellent, in fact, I think this thing sets

233
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:38,560
the bar as far as what XNA games should be, um, totally polished, it could easily be an

234
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,240
Xbox Live Arcade game, easily, um, so highly recommend you check it out, I went ahead and

235
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,360
purchased it cause it was awesome, so, check it out and buy it, cause it's good, and very

236
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,640
fun actually, and really colorful.

237
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,080
So for all those people out there that say you hate on community games, not true, cause

238
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
I love this one.

239
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,800
No, this is what I'm saying is, they need to be polished, it's cause a lot of the stuff

240
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,960
I see on there is not very polished, and that's my problem with it, you know, so you have

241
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,560
to look at games like this and go, oh my god, this is what they could be like, then what

242
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
the hell is everyone else doing?

243
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,400
That's my thing right there.

244
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,440
Vidpower in chat says, every time somebody talks about a carnival, I think about that

245
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,720
carnival arcade game, and you know, when you said carnival, I was thinking of that HBO

246
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
series, like, did they make a carnival video game?

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, it's not a carnival video game, no, it's really cool though, it's, um, easily something

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,600
though that could be an Xbox Live Arcade game, which it should be I think, but, whatever.

249
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:45,680
Um, and then other than that, I played a little bit of Dissidia, and a little bit of Animal

250
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,440
Crossing, and that's pretty much it.

251
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,920
I was gonna try to play some other things this week, but I didn't get around to it,

252
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,780
so that's okay.

253
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,840
My gaming week, you know, same old stuff, World of Warcraft, I've now done three wings

254
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,360
on 25-Man Naxx, thank you very much, because of our raiding alliance, but it was fun.

255
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,240
But here's the thing, other than that, you know what game I've actually been spending

256
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,800
like the majority of my game week playing?

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,960
Is Suikoden, yes, the old school PlayStation 1 game Suikoden, and why have I been playing

258
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
that of all games?

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,560
Well, they released it on the PlayStation 3, I think two weeks ago, I think Christmas

260
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,800
week as one of the backwards compatible games that you can play on your PlayStation 3 or

261
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,880
the PSP.

262
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,680
And it's kind of a hard to find game now, it was a collector's item for a little while,

263
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,720
I mean, now that it's on PlayStation 3, I'm not sure how that's gonna go, I'm sure the

264
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
hardcore collectors will still be after it, but those that want to play it now can do

265
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
so for $6.

266
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,960
So it's cool, because I remember playing the game once like a long time ago, I think I'd

267
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,880
rented it, but I didn't really remember it, and you know, one of my really good friends

268
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,680
has been on the show before, Shane, he always raves about Suikoden, and you know, I just

269
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,740
knew that a lot of people really liked the game, so I wanted to play it.

270
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,680
So yeah, I've been playing it, I've already dropped like almost six hours in it, and it's

271
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,400
fun and the story's a lot better than you'd think it is at the beginning when you realize

272
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,600
the graphics are kind of a step up from the Super Nintendo, but that Fortune Wheel boss,

273
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
for those of you who have played Suikoden, you'll know what I'm talking about, the Fortune

274
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,400
Wheel boss, seriously, that was the worst thing ever, ever.

275
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,520
But I got past it, but man did that take persistence.

276
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,360
Basically there's a boss, that's a giant roulette wheel, and you step onto it, and you land

277
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,520
on a square that might be a monster, or might be experience, but you're waiting to land

278
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,520
on the square that'll take you to the next room, but you might have to do the damn thing

279
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,440
like fifty times, I'm not even kidding, and do all these random videos, terrible.

280
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,000
But otherwise the game's pretty awesome actually, I really like the concept of going around

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,760
and recruiting people to join your army, because there should be an army of supporters that

282
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,880
I have.

283
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,000
Anyway, so that was pretty much my gaming week, it was a good classic, Suikoden.

284
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,120
Drew, how was your gaming week?

285
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,720
Pretty good, I had a cold for most of the week, better now though.

286
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,880
Me too, that's kind of ruined my week too.

287
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:14,200
I sat and played World of Warcraft, I'm actually a main tank now, one of the tanks for my guild.

288
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,800
I took advantage of the Steam sale that happened at the end of the year, picked up some games,

289
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,200
finally got Portal, finally played through Portal, I mean five bucks, come on, played

290
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:33,960
through Bioshock, got Team Fortress 2, played that a little bit, Enemy Territory Quake Wars,

291
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,560
and I'm just starting out on Fallout 3.

292
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,120
So I've been a little busy gaming-wise, but it's all been good.

293
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,960
Now Fallout 3 has been one of those games that I want to play eventually, because I've

294
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,920
heard so many good things about it, I didn't play Oblivion until a few months after it

295
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,560
was out and I still loved it later, I'm just thinking of Bethesda games.

296
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,680
Is Fallout 3 seeming to be worthy of all the praise that's been lavished upon it by the

297
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,200
gaming masses?

298
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,600
I'll preface this with the fact that I hate Oblivion, but I like Fallout 3.

299
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,880
It's a damn good game.

300
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,960
It's a little tedious to walk this place and that until you get to fast travel back and

301
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,640
forth, but it's pretty good for a first-person style Fallout.

302
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,640
I kind of miss the holy turn-based thing, but V.A.T.S. takes care of that quite nicely.

303
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:27,120
All right, anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

304
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
That's about it.

305
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,760
Well then let's move on over to Sauce.

306
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Hello, Sauce.

307
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Hello.

308
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,960
How was your gaming week?

309
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
It was good.

310
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,720
Earlier in the week I played a lot of Eternal Sonata, which was...

311
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,000
We're having mic issues, if you heard that, no I don't think it was you, I think it was...

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,840
One of these mics is like on the fritz, it's on its last legs.

313
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,400
It's the one I told Andrew to use.

314
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Is it?

315
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,760
Yeah, I think that mic is going to go any day now, so sorry.

316
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,880
If you hear random things, sorry about that, live radio.

317
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
It sucks sometimes.

318
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Go ahead, Sauce.

319
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,440
So I played Eternal Sonata, which is fun.

320
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,720
I had never...

321
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,440
I just got an Xbox 360 the day after Thanksgiving, so I'm kind of catching up on games that people

322
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,160
have already played before, and that was fun.

323
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,680
And then New Year's Eve we played a lot of Rock Band, or I saw Lips, which I thought

324
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,760
was pretty cool, because there's a lot of poppy music that Jamie hates, but I thought

325
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,080
it was great.

326
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,600
Let's see, we played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, which was fun.

327
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:38,440
I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith with Dan, which was also fun, I like that game.

328
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:46,440
And I wound up waking up like five hours before Jamie or Dan did on New Year's Day, so I wound

329
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,400
up trying out Fable 2, because I'd never played that, and I'm really addicted.

330
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,360
I've been waking up before everyone almost every day since I've been here, and I've been

331
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,400
playing that in the mornings.

332
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,480
And I accidentally killed my first husband, which was fun, oops, I forgot he was following

333
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,520
me and I went to go do a quest to kill bandits, and I accidentally got him killed.

334
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,680
So then I remarried, and then I moved into a nicer house, and then in the gypsy camp

335
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,880
I found a lesbian who was in love with me, so I married her also.

336
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Yeah I got a bigamist achievement for that, so it was fun.

337
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,400
So yeah, that was pretty much my gaming wig.

338
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,880
I heard you named your baby Optimus Prime.

339
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,680
Yeah, I had a baby with my second husband and I named him Optimus Prime.

340
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,800
Awesome.

341
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,320
He likes tofu.

342
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,720
As any growing boy should.

343
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Alright.

344
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:56,480
Wow, anyhow, let's get a move on talking about some podcast updates and the show.

345
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,960
There is no show next week, just a reminder, we will not be here live next week, January

346
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,680
11th.

347
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,380
That's because we're on vacation, I'll be out of the state and I think everybody else

348
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,120
just wants a week off after the holidays, so enjoy your night off from OLR.

349
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,260
We will be back however on the 18th.

350
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,800
Also, speaking of which, as far as the podcast feed goes, I know it's been behind and lagging,

351
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,920
but it's all caught up now, so go enjoy all the latest episodes of Orange Launch Radio.

352
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,180
You may have to dig back into iTunes a little bit, pick up all the shows you may have missed.

353
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,740
So everything is all caught up there and is hunky-dory in Podcast World.

354
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,260
So now let's get into tonight's news and stuff and we'll get into a game later on, which

355
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,180
some of our chatters can play and possibly win a fabulous prize.

356
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
We'll talk more about that later.

357
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,160
Loki, why don't you start us off with some gaming news tonight?

358
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,040
Alright, well guess what?

359
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,000
The Nielsen company has done a bunch of different polls and one of those polls that they have

360
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,180
tabulated was, what was the most played game console for 2008?

361
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,020
Well congratulations Sony, it was the PlayStation 2.

362
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,820
And that had 31.2% of the market share, which is not surprising because it still has the

363
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,280
largest market share of game consoles out there right now.

364
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,160
Number two was the Xbox 360 with 17.2%, followed by the Wii with 13.4%, which is interesting

365
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:31,920
because there are more Wii consoles out there than Xbox 360, followed by the original Xbox

366
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:39,520
with 9.7%, and then sadly after that, the PlayStation 3 with 7.3%.

367
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,160
Wait, so more people are playing the original Xbox than are playing the PlayStation 3?

368
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,000
That's right, the original Xbox, the system they stopped selling a couple years ago.

369
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,920
Ouch, that's too bad.

370
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,400
And then of course GameCube with 4.6%.

371
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,440
So hey, at least they're beating the GameCube.

372
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,760
I notice handhelds aren't ranked in there though.

373
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,280
Yeah, because they think they're talking about home console and, you know, I don't know,

374
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,360
they just didn't consider handhelds I guess.

375
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,480
Because if you talk about handhelds, they ain't got to do like, you know, the iPhone

376
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,280
maybe, and it's just, you know, we'll just ignore the handhelds.

377
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,560
Alright, well, do you think things might change in 2009?

378
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,520
Do you think at some point something's got to overtake the PlayStation 2 eventually?

379
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,640
I'm kind of surprised the Wii wasn't higher up there, I mean, I am and I'm not.

380
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,880
Obviously the Wii's biggest problem is that once the novelty of Wii Sports and all that

381
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,160
wears off, it kind of just sits there and gathers dust, but, you know, there's still

382
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,380
a lot of families, especially at Christmas time, that are all playing Wii Sports together

383
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,120
and stuff, you know?

384
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,480
But, you know, would you rather be, I mean, would people be playing Wii Sports for like

385
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
six hours a day?

386
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,960
I mean, there's some people, obviously they'll play more hardcore, like RPGs and stuff like

387
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,840
that, like Fallout, you know, and, you know, Fallout, they could be playing that for hours

388
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,920
at a time and that just kind of goes right by, but the Wii doesn't really have anything

389
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,240
that takes up tons of time, I mean, Animal Crossing, but hell, that gets boring after

390
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,440
a couple hours, so.

391
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,240
It's not really that big of a surprise.

392
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,640
I guess all those people that are playing Wii Fit, or not playing Wii Fit, or not playing

393
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Wii Music, very funny.

394
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,720
Rob has escaped us.

395
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,640
Rob ran away while I was having network difficulties.

396
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,200
Sorry, live radio folks, I tried to go fix the network by plugging in the extender, which

397
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,680
I had unplugged earlier in the week because it was causing me issues of the PlayStation

398
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
3.

399
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,360
Boy, 2009, not off to a good start in regards to the technical difficulties, is it?

400
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,760
We have mic issues and network issues.

401
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Good lord.

402
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,560
Hey, but one thing that's not having issues, it's growing and growing is XNA and the community

403
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
games on Xbox Live Marketplace.

404
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,240
What are you laughing about over there, Saws?

405
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,040
My lame transitions, or what?

406
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
Okay.

407
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Anyhow.

408
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Hey, obviously there are just tons and tons and tons of games on the community games list,

409
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,320
and it's kind of hard to figure out, like, what is good and out there to download.

410
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,840
I mean, you know, obviously there's a lot of good stuff out there, but there's some

411
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,920
also not good stuff out there, so trying to be able to sort it all can be a challenge.

412
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,680
Well, this website, gamerbytes.com, actually decided to put together their top 10 XNA community

413
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,760
games of 2008.

414
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,520
It's from gamerbytes.com.

415
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,880
They say, Galax email, Monaco 360, which looks a little bit like Rally-X to me, I don't know

416
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
about that.

417
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
It's a remake of Monaco.

418
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
Oh, it's a remake of Monaco GP, okay.

419
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,160
Cave-In was eight, Star Pilot was seven, Weapon of Choice was six, Hexothermic was five, Duotrix

420
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,440
was four, Johnny Platform's Biscuit Romp was three.

421
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,600
I almost downloaded that today.

422
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Biscuit Romp?

423
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
That sounds kind of awesome.

424
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
That sounds kind of dirty.

425
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,400
Ultratron was number two.

426
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,800
Which looks like a complete rip-off of Robotron, by the way, but still looks pretty.

427
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,160
And number one was the game that Loki was earlier talking about, Carnivale Showtime,

428
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,120
which must be part of the inspiration for him to download it, maybe?

429
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Yes, it would be.

430
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Ah.

431
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
So...

432
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,480
I didn't even know it was on there, because I usually check, you know, quite a bit for

433
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,780
different games, but it must have been something that's just recently added.

434
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,200
How sad, though, that our buddy Aaron in his game Snake 360 did not make the list, but

435
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
maybe next year.

436
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,320
He must have been number 11.

437
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,400
I don't know.

438
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Maybe next year.

439
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,560
It's unfortunate, because there's probably so many games out there right now, and there's

440
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
nothing really to...

441
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,760
I mean, you can look at the top downloads and stuff like that, but that's kind of skewed

442
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
sometimes.

443
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Yeah?

444
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
I don't know.

445
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Yeah, it can be.

446
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,060
I wonder if anybody's figured out a way to kind of, like, stack the deck.

447
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,060
You know what I mean?

448
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,280
Nobody's figured out a way to cheat that system yet, or anything like that.

449
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,300
Download the trial a bunch of times, I don't know.

450
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,040
Do you think it would require unique accounts, or what?

451
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Maybe.

452
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I don't know.

453
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,920
But, Jamie, that one game, the Biscuit Challenge, or whatever, that's only at 200 Microsoft

454
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,600
points to download.

455
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,680
Looks kind of like a neat little platformer game.

456
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,520
Maybe I'll have to invest and challenge the Biscuit.

457
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
You hear that, fireplace sim?

458
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
200 Microsoft points.

459
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,880
Don't need to be 500.

460
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,520
That's ridiculous for stupid, fake-looking fire.

461
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Alright.

462
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,160
Well, I'll have to check some of these out.

463
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,560
I've been falling behind on the community games, and I keep meaning to stay on top of

464
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
them, but...

465
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Seriously, Carnevale.

466
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
That's awesome.

467
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Alright.

468
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I'll definitely make it a point to check that one out.

469
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,880
I even bought a bigger hard drive so I could download more games, so I swear I will at

470
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
some point.

471
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
They actually had some pretty cool stuff.

472
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,360
They had a music-making program on there now, which is kind of neat.

473
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Hmm.

474
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
I'll have to check that out.

475
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,320
Well, how about some other top 10s?

476
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,320
And this is Eurogamer's top 10 games, so we're looking a little bit to the overseas opinion.

477
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,480
But number 10 was World of Goo, which is We Wear in PC, and it's actually something that

478
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,200
I was really interested in, just because it looks so bizarre.

479
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Another, the next one is Guitar Hero World Tour for 9th place.

480
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,320
And I have to use your slow internet to get to the next one.

481
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Really?

482
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,560
There was a lot of people hating on Guitar Hero World Tour when I talked to them.

483
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
So interesting.

484
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
But this is Europe.

485
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,960
I know, but still, it's not like it's a completely different game.

486
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,560
It's interesting.

487
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,900
Number 8 was Gears of War 2 for Xbox 360.

488
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,120
It was pretty epic.

489
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,360
7, Left 4 Dead, which is Valve's zombie game.

490
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,360
I've definitely seen both of those on a lot of top 10 lists this year, that's for sure.

491
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Zombies!

492
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,800
6 is Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, a pretty shiny game.

493
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,640
That game was pretty awesome and was sadly neglected from a lot of top 10 lists this

494
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
year.

495
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,680
That was a pretty awesome game.

496
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,160
5 is Braid from Xbox Live Arcade.

497
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,080
And then, moving forward, I'm surprised it's only at 5.

498
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,240
Number 4 is Fable 2.

499
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Fable 2 is very, very British.

500
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,680
I mean, because it's the spelling and everything.

501
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
But anyway.

502
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,400
3, Grand Theft Auto 4.

503
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,100
You all knew it would be up there.

504
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,520
Moving on to number 2.

505
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,440
Number 2 is Fallout 3, which is pretty darn awesome.

506
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,320
And number 1 is LittleBigPlanet.

507
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,360
Excellent choice for LittleBigPlanet, but I didn't hear Rock Band 2.

508
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,040
So they put Guitar Hero World Tour on this list, but they didn't put Rock Band 2 on there?

509
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
That's interesting.

510
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,560
Or did Rock Band 2 not get released over there yet?

511
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
I don't even know.

512
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,000
Because, you know, the delays and everything.

513
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,480
I thought they got it.

514
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,800
I thought they didn't have nearly the delay we had over here.

515
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
Very interesting.

516
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Hmm.

517
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,360
Maybe they were feeling, or, you know, this is just one particular website, obviously.

518
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,040
It's not the whole country's opinion.

519
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,320
But maybe this particular website was, you know, maybe put off by the fact that it felt

520
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,520
like more of an upgrade to the previous Rock Band game.

521
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Don't know.

522
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,880
There was a story, kind of tied in with this too, that Peter Moore was pissed off at EA

523
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,200
because FIFA didn't make the list.

524
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,520
How so?

525
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,680
Because it's a European game, and FIFA soccer always usually is one of those bigger games.

526
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,720
And so he was pissed off that it didn't make the list.

527
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,040
Actually, there was a Top 50 list that they did too, I think.

528
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:47,120
They had like Mirror's Edge and stuff like that on there, but FIFA's not on the list.

529
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Ouch.

530
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
So bad.

531
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Interesting.

532
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Or too bad, so sad.

533
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Yeah.

534
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,360
Well, maybe that's just a hint to, you know, do...

535
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
I don't know.

536
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,080
I didn't play the game, so I don't know if it's good or not, but, you know, I would...

537
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,520
Maybe it's just a hint to do better next time?

538
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,080
I don't know.

539
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Maybe.

540
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:08,880
The PS3 may not have led as far as console game playing share, but they are leading in

541
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,360
one thing, and that is web browsing.

542
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,020
Between the PlayStation 3 and the Wii, PlayStation 3 has won.

543
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,560
They actually have quite a few people browsing.

544
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:30,920
Of course, when you compare all the browsing platforms, including PC and stuff, 0.4% of

545
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:40,000
all web browsing is done on the PS3, compared to the 0.01% that's done on the Wii, so yay!

546
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,400
Go 0.3% or 0.3% better.

547
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Yeah.

548
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,720
What do people actually browse the web for on their TV?

549
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,000
I mean, I can't imagine like checking my email on the TV and stuff.

550
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That would just be terrible.

551
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,560
YouTube and Pornotube, that's pretty much it.

552
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Exactly what I was gonna say.

553
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,920
YouTube and XTube are pretty much all I can think of, and I will say this.

554
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,640
I actually, you know, believe it or not, I had not seen that whole jizz in my pants thing

555
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,680
from Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago that had become a viral video.

556
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,360
So my friend finally made me go on YouTube and watch it, and I did it on the PlayStation

557
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,080
3, and it was much smoother than when I had tried to use YouTube on the Wii before.

558
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,440
So I will say it was superior YouTube on the PS3.

559
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,240
Because they have Flash 9 built into the PlayStation 3 browser, whereas the Wii only has Flash

560
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
7.

561
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
Oh, okay.

562
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,920
Because certain people that, you know, develop the Wii don't give a shit about online.

563
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,880
I see, I see.

564
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,540
And then I saw the jizz in my pants thing, and it wasn't as funny as they made it out

565
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,600
to be, I have to say.

566
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,160
But it was still kind of funny.

567
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,440
Anyway, if you have no idea what I'm talking about, Google it or something.

568
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
Oh.

569
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
What?

570
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:57,040
Totally unrelated, but they have a new Charlie the Unicorn that they did for YouTube Live.

571
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,320
It's hilarious.

572
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
It's short, though.

573
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,640
Like a third one?

574
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Yeah, sort of.

575
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,440
It's like a little short thing that they did during YouTube Live.

576
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,400
And they had Rick Ashley in there.

577
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Interesting.

578
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,920
And they were talking in Russian.

579
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Hmm.

580
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,440
Well, we've been keeping our eye on the game blogs this week, and one thing that caught

581
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,480
our eye on one of the game blogs was this story on Joystiq about a study that buff game

582
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,520
characters apparently give men a negative body image.

583
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,980
And you know, this is interesting.

584
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,720
You know why this is interesting, because we hear all the freaking time about women

585
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,520
and the supermodels and the wafer-thin looks and women just want to be beautiful and all

586
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,120
this crap because Hollywood screws up everybody's perception of what's normal and da-da-da.

587
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,220
But you don't hear it a lot about men.

588
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,080
So that's what I thought was very interesting about this story is that it kind of calls

589
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,400
attention to, well, maybe there's guys that get image problems as well.

590
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,120
And apparently, they're quoting a study from researchers at Kansas State University.

591
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,200
And apparently what the study showed is that if you view extreme body images in games,

592
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,080
I don't know what that means, extreme body images in games.

593
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:13,960
Like, is there, like, plus I wouldn't think, like, you know, muscular men extreme cells,

594
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
but you know, maybe...

595
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,920
Depends what market you're marketing men for.

596
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Exactly.

597
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,720
It's gonna sell 10%, you know, or it's gonna sell the, you know, women or whatever, but

598
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,920
anyway, I don't know.

599
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,440
Anyhow, but they say 15 minutes of seeing these extreme body images.

600
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,760
It's enough to give both males and females, so it's not just, you know, no, here we go

601
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,600
with women again, sadly, unfortunately having to look at this in the media, giving them

602
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,560
a negative impression of their own body image.

603
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,800
Oh, that's bullshit.

604
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
I'm sorry.

605
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
You think it's all bullshit?

606
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
That is bullshit.

607
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm playing games with, you know, muscular main characters all the time.

608
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,420
Doesn't mean I want to go work out.

609
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,420
Fuck that.

610
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,420
I'm playing a game.

611
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
It's a fictional character.

612
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
What the hell do I care?

613
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,480
Well, if you want to know a little more about this, you can actually go to where the study's

614
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,740
actually at, which is on some television station's local website.

615
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,520
And apparently it was put together by a graduate student who organized two study groups of

616
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
university students.

617
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,320
Okay, here's the extreme game they were talking about, WWF WrestleMania 2000.

618
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,840
That's an N64 game.

619
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,040
The hell?

620
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,000
Well perhaps, I don't know, perhaps the, wow, the news station must be really short over

621
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
there.

622
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,120
Perhaps the news station must have butchered something, I don't know.

623
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,920
This is Kansas, after all.

624
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,180
And apparently, you know, I love this quote from the news article, included enormous muscular

625
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:41,200
specimens such as The Rock, Big Boss Man, and The Undertaker.

626
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Wrestling or gay porn?

627
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
You be the judge.

628
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Seriously.

629
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,040
Like, I don't watch a lot of wrestling, but damn, Big Boss Man, like, I think I saw him

630
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,620
at Folsom Street Fair.

631
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,120
Big Boss Man was awesome.

632
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,240
I'm just saying.

633
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,560
By the way, the second study was women and they had to play a beach volleyball game.

634
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,080
Well, that's probably DOA beach volleyball right there.

635
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:11,640
I mean, Boa, and then the story goes on to say, both male and female subjects viewed

636
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,760
their own bodies more negatively after completing a cycle at the game control.

637
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,540
He said the immediacy of reaction by game players was disturbing because video games

638
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,760
are such a powerful element of popular culture.

639
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,400
But here's the weird thing is that they were playing, like, sports video games.

640
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
It's stupid.

641
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,120
To me, they probably, it's totally skewed as far as what they ask the questions and

642
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
stuff.

643
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,600
Do you look as good as this character?

644
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,320
Well, fuck no I don't because I'm not, you know, a fictional character that can, you

645
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,240
know, for example, like women and stuff, this character, obviously the physics of her body

646
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,960
don't exist in the real world.

647
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,080
It's like, come on!

648
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
It's retarded.

649
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,720
Absolutely retarded.

650
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,040
And I don't think there's anyone that goes and plays a game of, like, I don't know, Conan

651
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,280
or something like that and then goes and cries because their body is, like, you know, pathetic

652
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,280
compared to that.

653
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,480
Well, you know, I don't want to look like some of these, you know, big guys because

654
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,800
I don't want to be addicted to steroids and crack.

655
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,440
Although I do have to say, though, playing games with lots of guns makes me want to own

656
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
guns.

657
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,640
So there is, you know, that correlation.

658
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,480
I wouldn't say that because there's a lot of people out there that are going to use

659
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,600
that, you know, like, oh, it just incites violence.

660
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,560
See this guy on this radio show says now he wants a gun because he plays games with guns.

661
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
So he's going to go shoot.

662
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
I bought another one, actually.

663
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Oh my god.

664
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Yeah.

665
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
G36C.

666
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,560
So now I've got that to go along with my shotgun and my P90.

667
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Wow.

668
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,560
Yeah.

669
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,880
Oh, and my high kappa 51.

670
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Wow.

671
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,560
It's a hobby that I really shouldn't be getting into.

672
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
All right.

673
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Let's see.

674
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm reading some comments from chatroom message.

675
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,480
J100Matt says, did the N64 just get released in Kansas?

676
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
Apparently.

677
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
I don't know.

678
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,560
This story had to have butchered something.

679
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Kazowm.

680
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,040
I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.

681
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,200
Kazowm says, I bet every woman wishes they could jiggle their boobs like that.

682
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,000
Probably a referencing dead or alive.

683
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,540
I would think that would hurt.

684
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,400
You know, I've never had boobs and I don't really want to, but I would think that if

685
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,840
you jiggle them a lot, like it would really start to hurt because if I were to try and

686
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:26,920
jiggle my balls, that would probably hurt after a little while.

687
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,840
Does it hurt if you run naked?

688
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,880
No, it feels quite free.

689
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,560
Well, I don't know.

690
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Let me try.

691
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Wow.

692
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,200
They were playing the old game.

693
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,840
I thought it might have been a mistype or something like that, but it's actually WWF.

694
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,280
I mean, WWF hasn't been around for a while now.

695
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
I know.

696
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
I know.

697
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
This is amazing reporting done.

698
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,060
Yeah, but if you've played one of those wrestling games, you've played them all, they're all

699
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,680
pretty much exactly the same.

700
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,920
So that's probably all they could afford with our dying economy in Kansas.

701
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,440
In between the ramen.

702
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,440
And all that.

703
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Nice.

704
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,720
Seriously, just rent a game.

705
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
I mean, god.

706
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,160
It's like, this is 64, what is this?

707
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,200
I don't remember that.

708
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Alright.

709
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Anyhow.

710
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Sorry.

711
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:29,560
Bresloll is in chat, a co-host of Saturday Night's Understation Live here on All Games.

712
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,040
He's screaming, Photoshop robs balls.

713
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,200
Why would you want to do that?

714
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Why?

715
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,160
Why would you even suggest that people do that?

716
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,720
Unless you're talking about playing pool and billiard balls.

717
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
That's okay.

718
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Or beach balls.

719
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,680
Maybe I'm going on a trip to the beach, I need a beach ball.

720
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,400
Or I'm at Walmart and I'm standing in front of one of those big cages full of balls and

721
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:56,640
I'm trying to undo the thing at the bottom so that they all roll out onto the floor.

722
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,480
That's okay.

723
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,400
But whatever you're suggesting is not okay.

724
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,280
Because we all know billiards is gay.

725
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Anyhow.

726
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Shoutout.

727
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,820
You have to like knocking around some balls.

728
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,640
Who doesn't like to knock around some balls once in a while?

729
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
Hey!

730
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Let's move on with some gaming news.

731
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:19,360
Well, for those of us who are Xbox owners and are really enjoying the whole, you know,

732
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,440
Avatar thingy that's going around, there's some new accessories to be coming out.

733
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,520
Actually different Avatar clothing.

734
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,080
Your phone talks funny!

735
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,120
Sorry, I'm yelling at Sauce.

736
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,160
Her phone just went off in the studio.

737
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,320
Well, there's basically a rave pack that's going to be coming out.

738
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,460
For the boys, there's a pixel art hoodie, a rave baseball cap, pink sweatbands, green

739
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,440
skinny fit jeans, and dark purple jeans.

740
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,520
I'm sure that you can't use that for the girls.

741
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,360
For the girls, there's a green chunky ring, a red chunky ring, yellow fingerless gloves,

742
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:03,560
blue fingerless gloves, chunky beaded bracelet, dayglo zebra print pumps, and a rave baseball

743
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,560
cap and none of that sound.

744
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:18,840
Now you can have your very own rave on your Xbox!

745
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,320
The boys' stuff sounds better.

746
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:30,440
Fuck a bunch of that.

747
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Let's see.

748
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,600
So which one of those clothing items gives me the ecstasy?

749
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,600
I know, Leo Shannon Chat says, I want to know when the ecstasy pills are going to come with

750
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
the clothes.

751
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,720
That's the pixel art hoodie.

752
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,560
Kazaam in chat, I was going to say Kazaam because there's too many vowels, says you

753
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,080
can't actually make them not look gay.

754
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,480
I'm not sure if I should take offense to that or not, but whatever, it was funny.

755
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Alright.

756
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,920
Yeah, I mean, seriously, there's a clear difference between gay and rave.

757
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,840
Well, at a rave, everyone's kind of gay.

758
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,640
I don't know if you've ever actually been to a rave, but like, come on.

759
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,120
A cuddle room, Loki.

760
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,160
A lot of raves have a cuddle room, where everybody, you know what they do?

761
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,560
They cuddle.

762
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
All night.

763
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
That's kind of gay.

764
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Well, yeah, several of your parties have a cuddle room.

765
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,000
They want to grow, but I'm gay, so it's understandable.

766
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,040
Yeah, they want to group the easy chicks, and they're all high on ecstasy, so...

767
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Why not?

768
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
Alright.

769
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
I know.

770
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Everybody's happy when they're on ecstasy.

771
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,560
Alright, let's move on with some more news, please, before we get letters from angry parents.

772
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,600
Square Enix is bringing their next epic game to Xbox Live Arcade.

773
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,120
Will it feature Cloud or possibly any other Final Fantasy characters?

774
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,640
No, because it's not an epic game, and it's a puzzle game instead.

775
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,160
It's Yossaman Live will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

776
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,560
The game kind of looks a little bit like Bejeweled, except you're supposed to be making triangles

777
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,640
out of the characters.

778
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,680
And it looks like everything has frowny faces on it.

779
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,640
So it's one very unhappy puzzle game.

780
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,240
Except all the other creatures under the sea here, it looks like they have smiley faces.

781
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,640
Why does everything have to have faces is what I want to know.

782
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
What do you do?

783
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,840
Is the part of the puzzle putting faces together or something?

784
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,960
No, you actually create triangles.

785
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,480
It's like instead of making four in a row, it's making a triangle.

786
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,960
If everything didn't have faces, you wouldn't want to punch it.

787
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Good point.

788
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Good point.

789
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,160
You know, I'm starting to feel a little self-conscious because the smile on the block is better than

790
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,880
mine, and I might have to go see a counselor because of that, because I'm having issues.

791
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,560
Body image issues from Yossaman Live.

792
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,540
I want my hair to be as spiky as Cloud's.

793
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm having issues.

794
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,480
But apparently they're going to have this game come out also on the PlayStation Network

795
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
at some point as well.

796
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,600
But right now it's been confirmed for Xbox Live Arcade because there's a shot that shows

797
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,280
achievements.

798
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,960
So that's their hypothesis, I guess.

799
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,040
I'm sorry, here's the comment of 2009 in our chat room right now, and I can say that because

800
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,960
we're only, what, like four days into 2009?

801
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,520
SSJ100Matt says, the cuddle room is like the champagne room.

802
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,760
There's no sex going on.

803
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Funny.

804
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
Alright.

805
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:33,400
Anyhow, hey, Lips download content, Lips, because, you know, Dark Sakura wants to download

806
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,040
more songs for Lips, but actually these songs, wait, these songs might actually get her into

807
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,840
it because these are pretty cool songs.

808
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:45,800
Where Did Our Love Go by The Supremes, Be Good Johnny by Men at Work, and Let's Groove

809
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,720
by Earth Wind and Fire.

810
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
No.

811
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,320
Okay, failed.

812
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,400
Well hey, if you want to download the songs and try it for yourself, they're between 160

813
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,040
and 180 Microsoft points apiece because I guess they have variable prices in Lips.

814
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
I didn't know that.

815
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,040
I don't have Lips.

816
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,040
It's the one karaoke game I don't have yet.

817
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,080
It came a little late to the party, pun intended, and I've already dumped a bunch of money on

818
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,840
SingStar, but I imagine someday I'll probably have to pick it up.

819
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,520
There's going to have to be a really good song that comes on download that I just can't

820
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
get on SingStar.

821
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,820
Well, here's what you can do.

822
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,500
You can import any other song that you want since you can import any MP3 into it.

823
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,880
But I would imagine, I haven't seen it in action yet, but I would imagine that stuff

824
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,200
works kind of wonky.

825
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,760
Yes, and here's what I want to see.

826
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:33,080
I want to see someone import in Max 300 or something like that and see how that works.

827
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,480
Because that would be funny.

828
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,360
There are no lyrics to Max 300.

829
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,640
That's why it's funny.

830
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,640
That's the whole point.

831
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,080
That's the only song that Matt would sing in karaoke anymore.

832
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,520
No, I wouldn't sing it at all.

833
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,160
I'd just be curious to see how it works.

834
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,600
Seriously, like Orange Lounge Radio, if nothing else, this show has accomplished single-handedly

835
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,160
destroying karaoke for Loki, and he'll never sing it again.

836
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,200
Can't really destroy something that wasn't ever really built up in the first place.

837
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,200
I see.

838
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,920
All right, anyhow, check it out if you want.

839
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:15,900
Well, there is a reward, I should say, or maybe a gift, but there is an Xbox 360 military

840
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,320
appreciation bundle.

841
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,080
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

842
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,040
It's an appreciation bundle.

843
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
A what?

844
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,040
Appreciation bundle.

845
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,040
A typo on the damn page.

846
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,040
Oh.

847
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
No, it's a typo on the damn box.

848
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
Oh.

849
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,360
Oh my god, it is a typo on the box.

850
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Wow.

851
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,080
But you want to know what's even more hilarious about this?

852
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,540
Sorry, go ahead.

853
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:49,420
First of all, first of all, it's $299.95, and it's the pack that comes with Lego Indiana

854
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:58,240
Jones and Kung Fu Panda, but they also sold this at Best Buy for the same price.

855
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,400
But they include Blue Dragon now.

856
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,080
No, the one we bought was the same thing.

857
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,680
So they're basically unloading all their excess copies of Blue Dragon that didn't sell?

858
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
I don't know.

859
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,720
Well, no, there's no Blue Dragon in this pack.

860
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,420
This is the same one that Best Buy was selling for Christmas.

861
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,040
I'm looking at the dog tag in the corner, and sure enough, military appreciation.

862
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,160
Oh yeah, sorry, Blue Dragon is included with that one, sorry.

863
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,160
It was really tiny.

864
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
There you have it.

865
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,720
But still.

866
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,400
But what exactly, where does the money go to?

867
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,140
To appreciate them.

868
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,440
Is it going to a charity, or are they selling this in a particular area of Texas?

869
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,160
They're selling it on the military bases.

870
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,920
Yeah, it was the PX.

871
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,700
So it's a cheap marketing thing and nothing more.

872
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,480
It's no donation to a military society or a veteran's fund.

873
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
We want money.

874
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,600
Here, you're bored.

875
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
The end.

876
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
Interesting.

877
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Yep.

878
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,260
It's not only do you get the Xbox 360 with three games, but you get another free game

879
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,100
that's worth 20 bucks.

880
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,100
If that.

881
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:09,680
Yes, but you don't pay any taxes on base, military personnel don't, so that's another

882
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,160
added incentive to buy it on base rather than off base, and if that's the cheapest one,

883
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,160
then why not?

884
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,480
I guess that's a good point, because tax can really add up on some of those multi-hundred

885
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,480
dollar purchases.

886
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,480
Good point.

887
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:32,420
Well, if you want to use your Xbox 360 over wireless internet, there aren't really that

888
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,800
many ways to do it.

889
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,640
Of course, the Microsoft route would be paying $99.99 for their wireless gaming receiver.

890
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,560
However, there are cheaper ways to do it, though.

891
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,840
One new way that's been pointed out by Popular Science is that you can actually download

892
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:57,240
a freeware program to use an outdated wireless router and use that as a wireless gaming receiver

893
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,000
as well.

894
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,800
And of course, that'll cost you whatever you can find for a cheap router for.

895
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:11,000
Or as I've been reading as well, you can actually use the original Xbox wireless gaming receiver,

896
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,760
which is under 50 bucks.

897
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,940
Interesting.

898
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,200
Or pretty much any wireless gaming receiver out there that's probably cheaper than $99.99.

899
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,560
Yeah, I paid $99.99 for my little wireless gaming receiver.

900
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,840
It's not an official Xbox one, but it's like a third party one that will also work with

901
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,040
my PS2, which is why I bought it.

902
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,320
But man, that was 100 bucks, just so I can use it.

903
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,080
One reason, one thing I will give props to the PlayStation 3 for, as hard of a time as

904
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,880
I've given that system in the past, I didn't have to set anything up.

905
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,720
Well, yeah, I had to go through a setup, but there was no wireless thing.

906
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:47,160
It has built-in wireless on it, like they all should.

907
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,160
Mine doesn't.

908
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
Really?

909
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,160
It's a 20 gig.

910
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,840
Oh, that's right.

911
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
I forgot they didn't all have that.

912
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,600
They also don't have the fancy memory card ports for, you know, pictures.

913
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
I don't think mine has that either.

914
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,600
I don't remember.

915
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,600
You don't either.

916
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,600
Yeah.

917
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
What do you use them for?

918
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
All right, anyhow, sorry.

919
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,920
I just thought I'd bring that up.

920
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:13,600
Anyhow, you know, a lot of us have those Xbox 360 HD drives, and we're not really using

921
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,600
them anymore.

922
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,120
I don't know about you guys, but I actually unplugged mine, because I have maybe like

923
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,120
seven movies.

924
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,120
I'm broke.

925
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,120
I don't even really watch them.

926
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,120
Yours broke?

927
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,120
Yeah.

928
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,120
Oh my gosh, what happened to it?

929
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,120
It does some...

930
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,480
I wasn't there when it happened, but it's doing some sort of error thing that we can't

931
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:36,760
watch our movies on there, and a particular certain person that I married hasn't bothered

932
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,520
calling to get it replaced, so.

933
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,680
Well, if you really want a new one, I mean, they're only like 20 bucks at Fry's right

934
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,680
now, I think.

935
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,120
They went so far down in price.

936
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
I don't know.

937
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,040
Well, here's the thing, though, is that actually I guess what you can do...

938
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:58,160
I don't know if this is just the HD DVD player, or if you do this with the actual Xbox 360.

939
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,680
No, it's the HD DVD player.

940
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,680
Okay.

941
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,200
Basically, you break it apart, and you can take the blue diode out of it, and you hook

942
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,200
it up.

943
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,360
They showed it basically hooked up to a laser sight on a gun, but pretty much anything that

944
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,280
has a laser emitting diode.

945
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,640
You can make your own burning laser out of it.

946
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,640
Yes.

947
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,200
Like a shark with a freaking laser beam on its head.

948
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
You can actually make your own.

949
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Shark not included.

950
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:26,480
Yeah, basically, you take the diode out, and you build this really small chip that goes

951
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,480
with it, and you hook that up, and voila, a burning laser that can pop balloons and

952
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,480
burn paper.

953
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,480
Can it melt faces?

954
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,440
If it can't melt faces, it's worthless.

955
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,960
It might hurt if you leave it on someone's face for a while, but I don't know if it can

956
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,960
melt faces.

957
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Ow, ow, that hurts.

958
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
Get that dot off my head.

959
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
Ow, ow, ow.

960
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,160
Just as a disclaimer, please do not try a LASIK surgery at home by yourself using your

961
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,120
HD DVD drive.

962
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,760
Orange Lounge Radio does not endorse you actually doing this.

963
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,920
It's just kind of cool that you can make a face-melting laser out of your Xbox 360.

964
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,920
And if you don't want to break apart your HD DVD drive because of the single-melting

965
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,920
value or anything like that, you can either buy your own burning laser, or you can buy

966
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,320
a laser diode for 50 bucks.

967
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,840
Shahranden Chat says, laser cats can be a reality.

968
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,800
I would not give this to my cat.

969
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,080
Take it to her head.

970
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:25,320
I would come home and it would look like a BB gun army ran through my house.

971
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,920
The house would be on fire, for real.

972
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,360
Do not give this to a cat.

973
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,280
If you give this to a cat, you're beyond an idiot.

974
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,880
They're staring at the birds outside and saw, boof.

975
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,060
Ah, yes.

976
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,940
All sorts of awesome.

977
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,320
You come home and the fish tank's boiling.

978
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,800
I don't think that happened, but yeah.

979
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,800
Something to that effect.

980
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:59,360
The fish would be dead, her food would be toasty, the birds would be on the ground missing

981
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,360
feathers.

982
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,400
Pew, pew, pew, mew, mew, mew.

983
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,500
Sorry, can I look at this video really quick that was posted of somebody actually using

984
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
the laser gun?

985
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,500
I'm looking at it here.

986
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,500
I don't know if there's any...

987
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Oh, there's no sound here.

988
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,500
Yeah, he's basically just...

989
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,060
James Bond's weapon of choice, the Walter PPK.

990
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:24,480
We're not going to use the real gun, but a high performance semi-automatic CO2 version.

991
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,800
To make it burn, we need an Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.

992
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
Let's take a...

993
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, I don't know where this video comes from, but I see a little logo for a break

994
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,920
in the corner, so we'll just leave it at that.

995
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,040
Is there like an embed thing?

996
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,640
I don't know what hell the site this is, so whatever, we'll just play the rest of it.

997
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,160
The side panel snaps off and reveals some hidden screws, so you'll get to work and remove

998
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,160
all of them.

999
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,800
After popping off the cover, it's time to get rid of some more screws until the DVD

1000
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
drive is screwed up.

1001
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Okay, I want to see them burn stuff.

1002
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,360
I don't care about the whole process.

1003
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
We're boring.

1004
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,280
Now the laser assembly gets attached to the Walter.

1005
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:07,000
The new 007 laser weapon easily burns through electrical tape, pops a balloon, and also

1006
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,760
lights matches.

1007
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,120
The world's first 007 laser weapon, Burning Blue.

1008
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,360
Oh my god, if I were still smoking cigarettes, which I don't encourage anyone to do because

1009
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,880
it's very addicting and I quit, but if I were still smoking cigarettes, what an awesome

1010
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,720
way to light my cigarette.

1011
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,920
Hold on guys, I gotta get my gun to light my cigarette.

1012
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,400
Actually they had lighters that looked like little guns, but they just had fire instead

1013
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
of lasers.

1014
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,120
Anyhow.

1015
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,640
Oh wow.

1016
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,160
Sorry, just had a dream.

1017
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,280
I was a super spy for a minute with all these kinds of cool gadgets.

1018
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,360
But yeah, I won't be getting one of these anytime soon because I'm sure there's laws

1019
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,360
against it.

1020
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,100
However, there are some cool new games I could be getting pretty soon, but I'd have to travel

1021
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,820
to Europe to get some of these games, right DarkSakura?

1022
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,480
Actually no, nothing.

1023
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
Nothing?

1024
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
There's nothing I can buy?

1025
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,040
Nothing on the list.

1026
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,040
Well then I guess I get my laser.

1027
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,040
Not until the 16th.

1028
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,040
I guess I get my laser.

1029
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,200
Do we have any releases in the US?

1030
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,000
Yes, there are some crappy releases coming through the US.

1031
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,080
The first being Paws and Claws Pampered Pets for the Nintendo DS.

1032
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:22,240
Man, that's an ugly looking picture there with chihuahuas and ugly cats.

1033
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,680
They're all ugly characters.

1034
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,360
Paws and Claws Pet Resort, the same game but now on the Wii.

1035
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,400
Bigfoot Collision Course on the Nintendo DS, no pets involved with that one.

1036
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,760
Elibits, The Adventures of Kai and Zero on the DS, the sequel to the cool 3D game and

1037
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,520
now this is more like Pokemon.

1038
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,680
Moon is coming out from Mastiff on the Nintendo DS.

1039
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,360
Fishy Master World Tour on the Nintendo Wii.

1040
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,840
Jumble Madness, another fun puzzle game on the DS.

1041
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,560
And let's see here.

1042
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,400
Neighborhood Games on Nintendo Wii.

1043
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,760
Personal Trainer Math from Nintendo, because Nintendo thinks you don't know math.

1044
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,360
Can I interrupt these shitty games with a funny chat room comment?

1045
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,360
Sure.

1046
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,720
I mean as much as I'm sure our listening audience cares about all these fucking math games,

1047
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,480
this is just too funny because you know we're a little bit delayed so sometimes our comments

1048
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,680
on the previous story take a little while to run through chat so a comment on the whole

1049
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,760
laser thing.

1050
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,880
Shahran in chat says, imagine holding up a convenience store with that.

1051
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,000
Give me the money or I'll fucking laser your face.

1052
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,440
Horse Launch Radio does not condone these actions.

1053
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,000
You could brand somebody with a laser.

1054
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,640
Okay sorry Loki, continue telling us about the edutainment titles aplenty coming out

1055
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,640
this week.

1056
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
No that's actually it.

1057
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,640
Oh okay, good.

1058
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,360
Alright then let's talk about- What, no Jazz Jackrabbit?

1059
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,360
Alright.

1060
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,700
Let's talk about Japan and what you can look forward to over there.

1061
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,200
And actually it's a lot of price release, or price reductions, at least on the Xbox

1062
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,200
360.

1063
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,360
Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom, and Trusty Bell, which is our eternal sonata, they are

1064
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,320
both getting price reductions this week over in Japan, so enjoy those.

1065
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,320
PlayStation 3, nada coming out this week, you gotta wait till the 15th for anything

1066
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,400
coming out over there.

1067
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,440
Fallout 3 makes its debut on the 15th, you have that to look forward to.

1068
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:28,720
On the PlayStation 2, nothing, on the DS, nothing till the 15th, and it's probably the

1069
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,400
same story on the PSP as well.

1070
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,960
So that's really it, unless you want some price reductions, there is a Mobile Suit Gundam

1071
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:41,520
game on the PSP, Giron no Yabu, Axis no Kaiyui gets a price reduction, that's it.

1072
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:47,120
So it's the week of sales in Japan, otherwise no new stuff till the 15th.

1073
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,080
Well then how about just a little something else?

1074
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,480
How about it?

1075
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,640
Um, stuff.

1076
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,840
And nonsense.

1077
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,840
And download content!

1078
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,840
Horse armor?

1079
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,320
What the hell?

1080
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,200
You know, like Oblivion had the horse armor?

1081
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,200
Ah, forget it.

1082
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Forget it.

1083
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Anyway.

1084
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:16,480
Um, for the fans of Guitar Hero World Tour, there is a downloadable content, um, dated,

1085
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:22,760
it actually will be coming out, um, January 2009, at some point eventually.

1086
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,420
So let's go ahead and go by the date.

1087
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:34,220
So there will be, um, actually this should already, um, be out as Use Me by Hinder, Because

1088
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:42,760
of You by Nickelback, and Light It Up by Revtheory, um, on the 8th, there is, um, a, uh, Country

1089
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,080
Rock Track Pack, which is Me and My Gang by Rascal Flats, Tix by Brad Paisley, and Hillbilly

1090
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,280
Deluxe by Brooks and Dunn.

1091
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:58,360
Um, there's also, um, on January 15th, there will be Three Songs by Travis Barker.

1092
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:05,840
Um, the 22nd of January, there will be, um, Tomorrow by Silverchair, Dimension by Wolf

1093
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,040
Mother, and Out of the Way by The Vines.

1094
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:17,400
And then on the 29th, we have, um, uh, Oasis, um, with the full, uh, Dig Out Your Soul album,

1095
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,500
and, um, yeah.

1096
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:29,400
The album is going to be, um, 1,520 Microsoft Points, um, or, um, $18.99 from the PlayStation

1097
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,400
Store.

1098
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,160
I was gonna ask if that was the first full album for Guitar Hero, but I guess it's not,

1099
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,360
because they had the Metallica one, Death Magnetic came out, the full album, when the

1100
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,360
CD came out, right?

1101
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,920
Yeah, it's not the first album that they've had, they've had a few.

1102
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:41,920
Oh, okay.

1103
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Hmm.

1104
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,120
And Metallica's infinitely more awesome than Oasis.

1105
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,520
Uh, yeah, I'd say so.

1106
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,520
So.

1107
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,520
Interesting.

1108
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,720
Um, some other cool stuff that's coming out on the other music game platform, Rock Band.

1109
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:04,760
Um, the January lineup has been leaked out, as they seem to always happen, um, to do.

1110
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,400
Of course, we already knew that Roy Orbison was getting a download pack, um, they're gonna

1111
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,080
be six tracks available there.

1112
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:17,600
Claudette in Dreams, Mean Woman Blues, Oh Pretty Woman, Ooby Dooby, and You Got It.

1113
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:25,600
Um, then also, um, there will be a Lenny Kravitz pack, with, uh, Are You Going My Way, Freedom

1114
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:31,880
Train, Let Love Rule, and Mr. Cab Driver, and then finally two tracks from the Steve

1115
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,640
Miller band The Joker and Space Cowboy.

1116
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,120
See I think there's like one track in each of those packs you mentioned that I would

1117
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,120
want to get.

1118
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,440
Like, I don't think I can possibly be a guitar playing gamer and not want to get Lenny Kravitz

1119
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,980
Are You Gonna Go My Way, because that song is all kinds of awesome, um, even though I

1120
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,800
know it's in Guitar Hero World Tour but I still don't own that, I should get that at

1121
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,800
some point.

1122
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,080
Um, but I also want Pretty Woman and I want, um, The Joker.

1123
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,080
So that's pretty awesome.

1124
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,080
Yeah.

1125
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,640
You said I don't really want the packs, I just want the one song from each pack.

1126
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,920
Forget it.

1127
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,480
Anyhow, let's talk about someone who's stupid, but we actually can't give this person a stupid

1128
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,560
award because there's someone even dumber we're going to talk about later in the show,

1129
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:14,760
so just imagine what it's going to take to top this, but, uh, just more of an FYI to

1130
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,880
all of you people out there in the world, please do not actually take your credit card

1131
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,960
and, uh, put it in a Wii.

1132
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,800
Now keep this in mind, because the first thing I thought when I heard this, I'm like, bullshit,

1133
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:31,360
somebody's doing this as a joke, this is coming from a forum, so, uh, you know, take it with

1134
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,840
a grain of salt, okay?

1135
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:40,080
Um, however, apparently somebody posted on this forum, um, their neighbors actually got

1136
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,840
a Wii for Christmas, there was no games, but they got a classic controller and a nunchuck

1137
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:51,040
combo and a case and all that stuff, and, uh, so they were asking the kid for recommendations,

1138
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,200
they recommended Animal Crossing City Folk, Wario Land Shake It, Mario Kart Wii, and Super

1139
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,920
Mario Galaxy, those are all good recommendations, I think, uh, and then said to go on and get

1140
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,640
some virtual console games like Super Mario World and Sonic 2, uh, so the mom said, asked

1141
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,280
what virtual console is and da da da, and the kid said, all you have to do is put in

1142
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,400
your credit card when you're prompted to on the shop channel.

1143
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,000
So what does she do?

1144
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,400
She actually tried to put three credit cards into the disc slot.

1145
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,000
What a fucking moron.

1146
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,800
That's why I'm like, nobody can really be this stupid.

1147
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,800
Can they?

1148
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,800
Really?

1149
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,800
Really?

1150
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,160
Can you go back to like those horror stories from tech support where somebody called, you

1151
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:36,280
know, like saying that they accidentally snapped off the, uh, uh, cup holder on their computer,

1152
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,880
which was actually the CD-ROM drive?

1153
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,880
You've lived it, Drew.

1154
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,120
Drew, can you, is this possible?

1155
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,360
Do you think this level of stupidity is actually possible, Drew?

1156
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,400
It is both possible and rampant.

1157
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,640
Why?

1158
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,640
Why do people actually think that?

1159
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:56,300
I mean, doesn't the screen make it pretty clear that you put in your credit card number?

1160
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:00,920
There are people out there who do not touch half the buttons on their TV remotes because

1161
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,240
they think we'll make the TV explode.

1162
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,240
I am teaching.

1163
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,320
Maybe they need those buttons.

1164
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,040
I do not push else explosion.

1165
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,480
I am teaching certain family members to use the digital cable guide as we speak.

1166
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,040
Hey, wait, wait a minute though.

1167
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,600
I will say Comcast system is pretty screwy that that does take a class or two to learn

1168
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,600
how to use.

1169
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,760
You need a college degree to be able to navigate that.

1170
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,240
It's not TiVo, Drew.

1171
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,520
I've never used TiVo.

1172
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,040
It's happy face and frown face.

1173
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,880
No, thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to rate things.

1174
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,080
I mean, a four year old could figure it out, I hope.

1175
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,120
But Comcast?

1176
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,120
Kind of crappy.

1177
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:51,600
Kazaam in chat, or Kazaam in chat, the name I can't pronounce tonight, says, once my friend

1178
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,400
was at work, this woman came in and was buying a Playstation 3 game, and she was asking him

1179
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,160
will it work on her VCR.

1180
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:05,680
Well, ma'am, do you have a beta?

1181
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,680
So I don't know.

1182
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,920
Apparently this is what it looks like if you actually put your credit card in the Wii is

1183
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,580
that then suddenly your system will have a lot of lines going through it and it's unable

1184
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:21,360
to read a disk because there's no actual disk in the system, just a jammed credit card.

1185
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
Congrats.

1186
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,360
God.

1187
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,480
I don't know.

1188
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,960
I kind of call bullshit, but it's a funny story nonetheless.

1189
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:33,040
You know somewhere someone's tried to do it, but what's happened here is that somebody's

1190
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:36,320
actually recorded it.

1191
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:42,000
Anyhow, let's talk about something a lot more relevant and something the smart people do.

1192
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,320
And what smart people do is that they go and they try to explore their gaming's history

1193
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,560
and play some obscure video games they may not have before.

1194
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,880
And Dark Sakura, well, heck, she's one of the smartest and she's here to pick.

1195
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,880
She's the most smartest, in fact.

1196
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,720
And she's here to pick a video game for you to play this week in a segment we call The

1197
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,320
Classic Game of the Week.

1198
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,900
So what should the kids play this week?

1199
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:09,480
The Classic Game of the Week was suggested to me by Sauce.

1200
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,480
I see.

1201
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,280
So this is a saucy way to kick in 2009.

1202
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,800
Captain America and the Avengers.

1203
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,760
Yay.

1204
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,680
This game is classic.

1205
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:32,680
Side scrolling, beat em up action with cheese ball voice acting and wonderful background

1206
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,680
music.

1207
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,600
Let's just have some of this background music.

1208
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,400
Can we, Rob?

1209
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,600
Well, maybe after the story part.

1210
01:04:44,600 --> 01:05:01,840
Anyway, you get to play as one of four of the Avengers, either Captain America, Iron

1211
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:08,760
Man, Hawkeye, or Vision, which why Vision is all white and not green and red, like Christmas

1212
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,760
is beyond me.

1213
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,840
It could just be graphical limitations at the time.

1214
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:19,000
But you could actually either play a four player cabinet or a two player cabinet.

1215
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,960
You just have to change it on the board itself.

1216
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,960
That's pretty cool.

1217
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,560
And you get sound effects, like in old comic books.

1218
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,360
You get black, wham.

1219
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,360
Or 60s Batman.

1220
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,360
Yeah, or 60s Batman.

1221
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,360
I grew up on this frickin' game.

1222
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:39,920
I remember playing it at Pizza Hut when I was six.

1223
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,920
No, it's great.

1224
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:46,320
It's the reason I went out to eat Pizza Hut, because the pizza certainly sucked.

1225
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,720
I went there to play Captain America in the frickin' event.

1226
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,040
Oh no, don't go to Pizza Hut and expect to get pizza.

1227
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,040
Oh no.

1228
01:05:54,040 --> 01:06:03,360
Anyway, you actually fight different, you know, your bosses, which will be Klaw, the

1229
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:12,000
Living Laser, Whirlwind, the Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin, Juggernaut, Ultron,

1230
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,440
Crossbones, and the Red Skull.

1231
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:22,480
You also get cameos by other Avengers, which, was Namor ever an Avenger, because it says

1232
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,480
he's in the game.

1233
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:28,800
I don't think he ever really was one.

1234
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:34,560
He was by hanging around sometimes, and shouting imperious ones.

1235
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:39,440
Anyway, but you had Wasp, Quicksilver, and Wonder Man.

1236
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,160
Is Samuel L. Jackson in it?

1237
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,800
No, this was before.

1238
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,400
This was before Ultimates.

1239
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,840
I see.

1240
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:57,160
This was David Hasselhoff era.

1241
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:02,120
Unfortunately, while the arcade version was great, the console ports really sucked.

1242
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:07,960
That's what I was getting to.

1243
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:13,200
The game was put out by Data East, and they released the Genesis version, and after that

1244
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,400
it was licensed to Mindscape, so there was a port to the Super Nintendo, the Game Boy,

1245
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,360
and the Game Gear.

1246
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:27,600
There was also an NES version, where you could only play as Captain America and Hawkeye,

1247
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,720
and you had to save Vision and Iron Man from the Mandarin.

1248
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,160
Which was kind of like playing Bionic, and it was actually supported, had this map set

1249
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,160
up like Bionic Commando.

1250
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,160
Yeah, it was a platformer.

1251
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,160
Yeah.

1252
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,160
It kind of sucked, too.

1253
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:45,880
Oh yeah, because Mandarin would so be able to do that.

1254
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,880
Well it-

1255
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,880
As if.

1256
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
Shock.

1257
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,760
At any rate, another bit of fun trivia is that the North American version of the arcade

1258
01:07:54,760 --> 01:08:00,520
machine, when your character dies, instead of saying continue, or like, America still

1259
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,440
needs your help.

1260
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,880
That's the part I remember about this game.

1261
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,600
Even I played this game when I was younger.

1262
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:08,600
I wasn't six.

1263
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,960
I was a little bit older, but a little bit.

1264
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,280
But I do remember that when you would die, America still needs your help.

1265
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,280
Yeah.

1266
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,640
It's a really lame- I can't move!

1267
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,680
It really tries to guilt you when they continue playing.

1268
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,320
Like if you don't put in another quarter, you are a terrorist.

1269
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,320
Basically.

1270
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:32,640
Well, clearly that line was removed from the Asian-European versions.

1271
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,560
Dear Data East, make more pinball.

1272
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,120
Where's our Avengers pinball?

1273
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,680
The end.

1274
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,960
Alright, so there it is, your classic video game of the week.

1275
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,680
Captain America and the Avengers.

1276
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,880
Please note- Sounds like a bad band.

1277
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:56,320
Specifically though, here are the arcade versions, not the console versions, which are a little

1278
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,320
bit shit.

1279
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,880
A little bit.

1280
01:08:58,880 --> 01:08:59,880
There you have it.

1281
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:00,880
Your classic video game of the week.

1282
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,280
So that's going to be a hard one for the kids to find, because you know, we would never

1283
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,840
endorse downloading ROMs and playing them on emulators.

1284
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,840
Oh no no.

1285
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,720
No, we've never used MAME in our lives.

1286
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,160
So you're going to need to find a Pizza Hut near you that still has this game.

1287
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,520
So good luck with that.

1288
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,080
Let us know what you find.

1289
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,760
Alright, so that's going to do it for this part A of our show, but hey, we still have

1290
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:26,080
plenty more, including, including hello tonight, we are going to play Match Game.

1291
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,720
That's right, tonight we're going to play Match Game and give away some prize.

1292
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,200
Are we going to tell them what the prize is that we're giving away tonight, or are we

1293
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,480
keeping it a secret, or what are we doing?

1294
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,520
We will tell you right after the break.

1295
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,280
Oh ho ho, good tease, alright.

1296
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,720
So we'll tell you right after the break, so stay tuned.

1297
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,760
See the podcast listeners though, they're not going to have to wait at all, except then

1298
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,120
again they don't get to play either, because the game will be done by the time this is

1299
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,120
the podcast feed.

1300
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,120
Sorry guys.

1301
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,800
I promise there will be a contest you can do very soon.

1302
01:09:50,800 --> 01:10:01,320
Anyhow, let's take a break, we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1303
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,080
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, January the

1304
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,080
4th of 2009.

1305
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,520
I'm very happy because I'm eating ice cream, Dark Soccer and Tiara Rara, or Sauce, brought

1306
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,120
ice cream tonight for us, and it's like the slow churn kind, so it's actually not that

1307
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,360
bad as far as fat goes either, so that made me very happy.

1308
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,160
Thank you both for thinking of that.

1309
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,160
Good.

1310
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,920
Now do we get to talk about our fabulous prizes tonight.

1311
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,760
The chat room, you see the podcast listeners just mere seconds had to wait, but the folks

1312
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:33,000
in chat, they've had to wait like 20 minutes, because we had such a long break tonight because

1313
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,440
of ice cream, to figure out what they're playing for tonight, so yeah.

1314
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,120
And Dark Knight in chat says, I hope you guys get brain freezes, but what is the fabulous

1315
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,120
prize you're going to play for tonight?

1316
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:48,880
Well tonight I have brought the prize, it is a $25 Amazon gift certificate.

1317
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,000
Wow, that's like a DS game right there, alright, very nice.

1318
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,120
So is this courtesy of AvengersTower.com?

1319
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,160
Sure, why not.

1320
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:03,600
I figured you guys have given Xbox related stuff out as prizes before, and some people

1321
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,560
don't have Xboxes, or some people would rather spend it on other things, so Amazon gift certificate

1322
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:14,560
kind of is whatever you want, you can spend it game related, or else whatever you want

1323
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,560
to spend it on.

1324
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,840
Alright, and our chat room is subsequently freaking out tonight, they're like, oh my

1325
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:24,040
gosh, it's $25 tonight, so the stakes are high tonight in match games, so we'll have

1326
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,840
a qualifying question later on, and then it will be the first person to get through on

1327
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,360
Skype when I say, not yet, when I say, if you call now you're going to piss me off,

1328
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,960
I'm not going to answer your call later, but when I say, we'll get to that a little later

1329
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,160
in the show, and it's match game tonight, and not only is it match game, it's epic match

1330
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:44,600
game, because there's five questions instead of the usual three, because we do have a big

1331
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:52,240
prize on the line tonight, so yeah, $25, there you go, and yeah, so sorry, those of us here

1332
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,640
in the studio can't win, I know as much as you want to win, you got to give it to a listener.

1333
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:04,800
Alright, Kazam and Chat says, that's like two euro, sad but true, sad but true.

1334
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,920
Alright, anyhow, let's get into some gaming news before we get to the fancy prizes, big

1335
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,440
money, big prizes, Loki, why don't you start us off?

1336
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:19,240
Alright, sweet, well, there's, I think we talked about this last week, there was some

1337
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:26,480
new Sega games, or I should say older Sega games, that were getting new ESRB listings,

1338
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:32,600
and one of those actually, that wasn't quite part of one of the ESRB listings, but it's

1339
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:38,280
been re-registered by Sega for another trademark, would be Choo Choo Rocket.

1340
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:46,480
Apparently on December 22nd, Sega USA has a re-registered Choo Choo trademark as one

1341
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:53,020
of many Dreamcast titles to get, I guess, remade.

1342
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:58,160
Some other trademarks that have been re-registered as well, Sonic Shuffle, Cosmic Smash, Jet

1343
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:05,280
Grind Radio, Virtual On, and now Choo Choo Rocket.

1344
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,600
That's interesting, I wonder what that means, it might actually be possibly coming out on

1345
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:15,040
Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and WiiWare, as people seem to think.

1346
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,760
Awesome, I guess if you're a huge fan of Choo Choo Rocket, I don't know, I was never that

1347
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,720
big on Choo Choo Rocket, but I'm hoping this means, I'm hoping that maybe some other big

1348
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,920
games will come out, thanks to this, so we'll see.

1349
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,080
Alright, sorry I'm laughing, because if I sound like I'm laughing, it's because I am,

1350
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,480
because I really shouldn't do this, but I send private messages during the show, and

1351
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,020
whatever, I know Jamie does it too, so we're all chatting and whatever during the show,

1352
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:44,160
so sometimes I send funny things, so that's why I'm laughing.

1353
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,480
Loki, do you talk to anyone else while the show's going on?

1354
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:47,480
No.

1355
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,480
Oh.

1356
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,480
Loser.

1357
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,480
I was talking to Drew, but now I'm done.

1358
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,480
You were talking to Drew?

1359
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,200
Yeah, I was IMing him with my phone, but now I signed out, because it's too hard to text

1360
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,600
IM.

1361
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,160
You guys are sitting literally mere feet away from each other, you could write on a paper.

1362
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:09,400
We did this the other night, because I sent something to her on Twitter, and then I was

1363
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,400
like, wait, she was right behind me.

1364
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,040
Or, and I guess I'll say this now, I was going to kind of leave it a secret until we come

1365
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:21,240
back from vacation and I actually have it hung up, however, the studio got a new present

1366
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:30,040
this week, thanks to Rama, sent us right over here, this whiteboard, and you might remember

1367
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:37,020
why we, I love this, we say something random on air and suddenly it shows up in my mail,

1368
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:42,400
we had talked about in the garage, hanging up in the big blank spot we have, a whiteboard

1369
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,760
to keep our issues that we have with, I think it was GameStop at the time, but I'm thinking

1370
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,760
maybe just our issues we have with various gaming companies we can actually write up

1371
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,920
there on the board, so we will actually have a whiteboard come the return of, come the

1372
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:12,560
return of, and I believe we'll also have a camera, finally, again next week, to actually

1373
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,560
show the board with, so, we'll talk more about all the stuff, we'll see, we'll see, anyhow,

1374
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,400
hey, Q Games, talking on the Playstation blog this week about some games that are coming

1375
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:23,320
out in 2009, they are pixel junk titles, two or three of them, apparently, are coming out

1376
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:27,560
this year, one of them has already come out, that was Pixel Junk Monsters for the PSP,

1377
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,960
however, who knows what the others could be, although, you know, if you believe what you've

1378
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:38,400
seen on Spike TV lately, there was skiing, fighting, and so on, so you can probably imagine

1379
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,160
there's going to be a pixel junk about some other type of genre you've probably already

1380
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:47,740
seen before, but, of course, one of the last games we got from them was Pixel Junk Eden,

1381
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:52,600
which was kind of like random, so who knows what it's going to be, I do not play this

1382
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,400
series an awful lot, but I know it's one of the few exclusive series they've got going

1383
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,840
on right now, right, Logie?

1384
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,840
Which one, though?

1385
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
Pixel Junk?

1386
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,240
Yes, it is one exclusive series that they have going on.

1387
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,240
Have you ever played it?

1388
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,680
I have not played these games personally, so I don't know a whole lot about it.

1389
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,080
I thought there was another one, like a Pixel Junk Racer game, as well.

1390
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,080
I think there is.

1391
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,080
Yeah.

1392
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,720
I don't know, I haven't really touched any of them, but remember, lately, you know, up

1393
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,640
until about a couple weeks ago, I didn't realize that, you know, I couldn't just spend the

1394
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:26,000
exact amount on the PlayStation Network for things, although I still don't see myself

1395
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,280
playing a lot of stuff on the PlayStation 3, so, uh, I'm a little hesitant to buy stuff

1396
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:37,360
like Pixel Junk games, just because I have so many Xbox Live Arcade games that I don't

1397
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,480
play, you know what I mean?

1398
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:41,480
Yeah, I hear you.

1399
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,440
All right, well, just thought I'd check.

1400
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,360
All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1401
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,360
Jamie?

1402
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:57,360
Well, this is, I guess, a matter of debate for several people.

1403
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:05,920
They're saying that collectible games are losing their value because of digital re-releases,

1404
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:12,600
especially if, you know, go look on Amazon, not on Amazon, but on eBay, for a lot of these

1405
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:17,800
titles, people are just not getting the money that they used to be able to get for them.

1406
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:26,160
For example, um, uh, Ikaruga, um, was, uh, $75 for the Dreamcast version, $45 for the

1407
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:31,200
GameCube version, um, when they both came out on Xbox Live Arcade, uh, the games went

1408
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:42,640
to $5 to $15, um, really, I honestly, I'm not really, I don't really care that much.

1409
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,880
This is good news for me.

1410
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,480
You collect a lot of video games, you have some obscure fucking shit in your house, so

1411
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,920
if anybody's gonna be pissed off, I'd imagine you'd be.

1412
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:51,920
Why?

1413
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,160
I have these games because I want to play the originals on the original system.

1414
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:03,280
If they go down in price, that means I can go buy them a lot easier than I would have

1415
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:08,400
been able to before, and I can hook up my Turbo Duo and freakin' play these games.

1416
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:15,560
Sapphire got re-released in Japan, you know, I could play it on, on PSP if I wanted to,

1417
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:20,000
but I still want to have the Turbo, the, actually I need to have a system that will support

1418
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,040
an arcade card, but I'd really love to play it on Turbo Duo, or on, I should say, PC Engine

1419
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:31,760
Duo, um, it, I don't really care so much about them being re-released, because the whole

1420
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,480
reason, now I was, I was kinda giddy for a little while about my version of, about having

1421
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:42,500
Dracula X, when, ooh, $300, I got it for $100, ooh, and, and then I was like, but, really,

1422
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:47,760
the whole reason I wanted the game was to play it, because it's a fun game, and if it's

1423
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,500
being re-released, that means that, you know, more people can actually get a chance to play

1424
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,720
the, the fun shit that I have.

1425
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,720
Like Suikoden this week, or Castlevania Chronicles.

1426
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,160
Well I don't really give a crap about Suikoden, sorry.

1427
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,160
Castlevania Chronicles?

1428
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,160
Yeah.

1429
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,160
Okay.

1430
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,840
But I mean, it's, it's, it's just, it's a game.

1431
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:11,560
Why shouldn't they re-release it, especially if they know people love it?

1432
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,040
Why shouldn't they try to make money off of old franchises, seriously?

1433
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,560
I have no problem with it.

1434
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:24,080
Even though, ooh, you're not special anymore, ooh, you know, if you've got the original

1435
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:30,720
game, and you've got the original system, and you can play said game on said system,

1436
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,720
that's pretty special.

1437
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,360
It's still kinda cool.

1438
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,480
It's, it's pretty cool, I think.

1439
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:39,280
I mean, you can, you've got the original experience in your hands.

1440
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:45,800
You can fit, like, every Atari 2600 cartridge ever made onto one CD, probably, but it's

1441
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:50,480
still, like, kinda cool when you actually see, like, an Atari 2600 system, and you actually

1442
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,920
see, like, the cartridge for Sword Quest, it's kinda like, oh cool, I remember this

1443
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,920
game.

1444
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,560
We hook up our nests and blow in the thing all the time, just to, you know, it's the

1445
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,560
same thing.

1446
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,560
It's-

1447
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:06,880
Rob, you could probably fit every single Atari 2600 cartridge onto one PlayStation 2 memory

1448
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,880
card.

1449
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:08,880
Probably, I wouldn't doubt it.

1450
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,720
Six megs for all the ROMs.

1451
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,280
Don't ask me how I know that.

1452
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,960
How do you kn- never mind.

1453
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,320
Well, at any rate, it's, it's a difference in experience.

1454
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,600
You can play the game, or you could go back on the system, and that's why I had a big

1455
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,680
problem with emulation for a little while, and it wasn't that I had a problem with people

1456
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:33,240
ripping games and emulating them and this, that, and the other, it's the fact that I

1457
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:38,560
really wanted to have the original game so that I could play it on my system and play

1458
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,120
the game the way other people played the game, you know, you know what I mean?

1459
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,120
Right.

1460
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:49,640
And, so that's where I think the, the special part of it is, you know, is having it and

1461
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,200
playing it, but seriously, if other people get to enjoy the game, I have no problem with

1462
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,200
it.

1463
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:58,960
If it makes it cheaper for me to get those games that I want, by all means!

1464
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,960
You know?

1465
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,960
Let's release more!

1466
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:06,000
Now tell me, though, how many people have a, uh, Turbo Duo.

1467
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Mmm.

1468
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It still works.

1469
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
You do.

1470
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I know.

1471
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,600
And I love it.

1472
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,600
But you know what?

1473
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:18,000
If anyone wanted to play my Turbo Duo, I would bring it over.

1474
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,840
As long as their house wasn't, you know, covered in dust that went up to my knees.

1475
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,320
Very nice.

1476
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,720
Your house is not that dusty!

1477
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,720
My house?

1478
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,720
Is it?

1479
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,720
No, Andrew's over there making faces at me.

1480
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,720
Oh.

1481
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,720
I don't know.

1482
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,720
Alright.

1483
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,720
My car is very dusty.

1484
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,900
It's probably dustier than your house.

1485
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:40,920
My PlayStation 3 is really dusty, except in the area where the eject button and the power

1486
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,920
button is.

1487
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,920
It's like a dust magnet.

1488
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:43,920
It's very interesting.

1489
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,120
If I didn't dust ours, it'd be like that.

1490
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,120
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

1491
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:53,000
You should put, like, that end dust on it or something, or, yeah, that would suck the

1492
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,040
dust to it.

1493
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,600
Let me, uh, read some comments from chat here.

1494
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,040
Footy, I'm sorry, not Footy Monster, Act F says, uh, Collectors, Swap Meets are your

1495
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,040
friends.

1496
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,200
I speak for my friends' experience.

1497
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,200
And my own.

1498
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,200
I don't know.

1499
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,560
Have you had a lot of luck at Swap Meets, Dark Sakura, in your collecting?

1500
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:07,560
Every so often.

1501
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,560
Yeah.

1502
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,560
Very cool.

1503
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,560
Hmm.

1504
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,320
Well, um, I know when Mega Man 9 came out earlier this year, it was pretty much the

1505
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:22,640
retro gamer's kind of dream game, um, especially, you know, perfect release for the, uh, Mega

1506
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:27,400
Man series, kind of going back to the roots of, like, the earlier Mega Man games.

1507
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,880
Well, it almost wasn't the case.

1508
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,720
Um, actually, 1UP did an interview with the producer of Mega Man 9 and said, uh, they

1509
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:43,120
had heard a bunch of, um, they were, management of Capcom was actually talking about doing

1510
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:52,280
a 3D Mega Man game for Mega Man 9 instead, um, which is interesting, and says, um, you

1511
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,920
know, they had heard lots of negative responses.

1512
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:59,600
They thought that it would be better to make it 3D and that the 8-bit style will only appeal

1513
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:07,280
to Mega Man fans, which would limit the sales potential, because it's all about money.

1514
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:12,120
And eventually they figured out that 8-bit graphics were also cheap to develop, which

1515
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,600
also made them money, so, yay!

1516
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,760
I just, I mean, would it have been the 3D game, like, the Mega Man Legends you've always

1517
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,600
been asking for, or would it have just been, like, just some shitacious arcade game?

1518
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,800
I think it would be, like, the later Mega Man X games, where it's, like, 3D, 2D type

1519
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,240
thing, um, which, you know, looking at Bionic Re-Armed, and, you know, Bionic Commander

1520
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:39,320
Re-Armed wouldn't be all that bad, but it's just not, you know, Mega Man 9.

1521
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,280
It would really depend, it would just really, really depend.

1522
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:46,920
I still think they should go back and do some new Mega Man Legends games for the Wii.

1523
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:51,680
I think it would be perfect, because the Wii can't really churn out anything, you know,

1524
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:58,160
that fantastic, so, it should be able to handle some ports of PlayStation 1 games, and, hell,

1525
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,320
I liked Mega Man Legends, I thought it was awesome.

1526
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,280
Do you think there'll be a Mega Man 10?

1527
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,280
Someday.

1528
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,280
Someday.

1529
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,280
I think Mega Man 9 did really well, so, uh...

1530
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,600
Or will they just call it Mega Man X and then really confuse us, because, you know, there's

1531
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,000
Mega Man 10 and now Mega Man X, it's just too confusing.

1532
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Uh...

1533
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,640
How about Mega Man 9-2?

1534
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,000
What happens when they get to Mega Man X-10?

1535
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,120
Uh, too crazy.

1536
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,120
Mega Man Triple X.

1537
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,120
Oh, yeah.

1538
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,120
Oh, yeah.

1539
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,120
Isn't that already fan-fiction?

1540
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,120
The love robots.

1541
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:31,640
You have to kill Cock Man and Boob Woman.

1542
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:35,160
Anyway, um, excuse me.

1543
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,360
I can hear the show going down the toilet.

1544
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,720
It must be that time for...

1545
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,720
Stupid Award!

1546
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:47,240
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the stupidest of them all?

1547
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:52,400
Well, this week, it is a 17-year-old, and so, therefore, we don't know their name, because

1548
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:58,600
it's some dumb kid, and this 17-year-old lives in Ohio, and what he did this week, he threatened

1549
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,080
to commit suicide on an internet video game.

1550
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,400
What game?

1551
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,400
World of Warcraft.

1552
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,520
That's right.

1553
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:11,480
He paged a GM in World of Warcraft and told the GM that he was suicidal, that the game

1554
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:15,520
is the only thing that he has to live for, and you might think, gee, Rob, that's pretty

1555
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,680
harsh of you to give somebody who's suicidal a stupid award.

1556
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,960
Well, uh, here's the whole thing.

1557
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,400
It was a joke.

1558
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:29,640
The kid did it as a joke, quote, to try and get what he wanted for the game.

1559
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:34,920
So in other words, because he wanted his fat purple loots or whatever, he tried to threaten

1560
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:41,700
suicide to try to get a sympathetic Blizzard employee, I guess, to give him free stuff

1561
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:42,700
in the game.

1562
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:43,700
I would've loved that.

1563
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:44,700
Just me.

1564
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,080
He'd be like, I'm going to kill myself for you.

1565
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,080
Give me free stuff.

1566
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,080
Yeah.

1567
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,080
You go ahead and kill yourself.

1568
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,480
I have the questions being asked where in Ohio.

1569
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,720
I think that they're like, oh God, is this in my town?

1570
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,320
Uh, it was in Middletown because it's being from the Middletown Journal.

1571
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,320
Oh no, it's Fairfield.

1572
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,320
Wait, wait.

1573
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,320
Wait.

1574
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,320
There's a sympathetic Blizzard employee?

1575
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,320
Fairfield Township.

1576
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,320
What are you talking about?

1577
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,320
What do you mean?

1578
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,880
There are no sympathetic Blizzard employees.

1579
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:13,760
Actually, the one GM I talked to one time was really nice.

1580
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,520
They said, uh, you know, my character's name is kind of funny.

1581
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,560
I don't want to repeat it, but you have a funny character name.

1582
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,040
They're like salutations and said my name and they even gave me a less than three, a

1583
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,040
little heart.

1584
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:26,120
It's a standardized greeting.

1585
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,960
Oh, whatever.

1586
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,960
You're a standardized greeting.

1587
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,360
I talk to a lot of them.

1588
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,600
Why are you like a, are you like a tattletale or something?

1589
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,360
I'm a role player.

1590
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,360
Oh God.

1591
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,360
Oh God.

1592
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,840
People love to fuck with me when I'm role playing with other people.

1593
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,840
I see.

1594
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:45,840
All right.

1595
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,360
Well anyway, uh, by the way, just so you guys know, the kid was handcuffed and placed in

1596
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,360
a patrol car.

1597
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:54,400
Uh, the boy was, which Jamie is applauding.

1598
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,680
The boy was then released to his father a little later, hopefully for some big spankings,

1599
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,920
even though he's 17.

1600
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,600
Somehow I don't think that would stop Jamie if it was her kid.

1601
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,600
No.

1602
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:11,560
If you were, if you were 17, if your 17 year old did this, would you spank them?

1603
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,560
Yes.

1604
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,280
Uh, by the way, the kid is going to appear in court on Tuesday, Tuesday, the sixth Butler

1605
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,640
County juvenile court.

1606
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,920
Wow.

1607
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:22,920
It does.

1608
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,040
It tells you practically where this kid lives in the story.

1609
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,040
That's not good.

1610
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,480
You can probably figure out who it is.

1611
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,560
I'm not going to say it.

1612
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,840
That's too much, but it's Billy.

1613
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,480
Wow.

1614
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,040
It's a first degree misdemeanor, by the way, for, uh, that whole thing.

1615
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,780
But you know, as a Blizzard employee, they do, I mean, props to them for taking all the

1616
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,780
claims seriously.

1617
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:46,720
Cause you know, you never know, you know, if you've ever dealt with suicidal people,

1618
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,160
suicidal people, they just want to talk to anyone that will listen.

1619
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,520
And I could totally see that I bet Blizzard gets some of these that are legit and like

1620
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:54,480
really sad and all that.

1621
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,440
So it kind of sucks that there's this one asshole kid who has to take the whole thing

1622
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,440
as a joke.

1623
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:03,000
And it's also in their best interest to keep their clients alive so that they can pay their

1624
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,000
money.

1625
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Besides just that low key.

1626
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,600
I just want to say businesses like that or companies like that do take things like that

1627
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,600
seriously.

1628
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,560
Cause it's bad PR if they die in them.

1629
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:20,280
Well, yeah, but a friend of mine actually, um, her, uh, friend's crazy boyfriend started

1630
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:25,240
texting her about how he was going to commit suicide and all this stuff.

1631
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:30,520
And uh, he was just crazy and they, uh, you know, he denied everything cause she called

1632
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,120
the police cause she was worried about him.

1633
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:37,080
She had all the text messages, they had phone records, you know, from all the calls and

1634
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:40,600
everything and he got dragged off to the funny farm and that could have happened to that

1635
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,600
kid.

1636
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,900
You know, they could have said, well, if he's going to commit suicide, let's call the police

1637
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,000
and have them take him to a mental institution for an evaluation.

1638
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,680
And I'm not sure if that's better or worse than jail, but long story short, don't be

1639
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:55,480
stupid and do things like that.

1640
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,480
That's right.

1641
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,020
You ever, you know, a 17 year old should have had the boy who cried wolf read to him when

1642
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:03,480
he was, you know, five or younger.

1643
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:06,560
Anyhow, there you go.

1644
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:11,600
That sounds like a quest that should be in world of Warcraft cause they like parodying,

1645
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,360
you know, all the fairytales.

1646
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:15,360
I don't know.

1647
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:16,780
They do like to parody a lot of stuff.

1648
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:20,280
They have a parody of PETA in the game, which I thought was really funny.

1649
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,200
Like if you get the blood of animals on you and then you try to run through this little

1650
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:26,760
encampment, like they'll all try to kill you and call you names.

1651
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,400
So it's kind of funny anyhow.

1652
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,260
I would think that they would want to throw blood on you, you know.

1653
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,080
That's not how it works.

1654
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:39,540
Anyhow, let's get to the part of the show where you guys get to interact with us.

1655
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:40,760
Not the skype line, but the other part.

1656
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,760
The mailbag!

1657
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,520
Every week you guys send us emails.

1658
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,120
Mailbag at orangelaundrytrader.com and we like to read them here on the air.

1659
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:52,560
So that's what we're going to do right now is allow you guys to get your emails read

1660
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,560
on the show.

1661
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:54,560
DarkSakura.

1662
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,560
Well, we've only got three emails.

1663
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:03,480
So the first one is from Cheeseburger.

1664
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:06,520
Hi, O.L.R.

1665
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,560
About a year ago while I was doing my math homework, I was listening to your wonderful

1666
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:14,840
show when my math book pushed the PSP off the table and broke the screen.

1667
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:20,120
I called Sony and even when it was still under extended warranty, they wanted $90 to fix

1668
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,120
it.

1669
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,120
Well, I thought, screw that, Sony.

1670
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,680
And my PSP gathered dust for over a year.

1671
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:27,760
Then I discovered the magic of eBay and got a new screen.

1672
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,400
It's like buying a new PSP all over again.

1673
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:36,240
So my question to you guys, and girls, is what games or UMD movies do you recommend?

1674
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:42,600
I don't like sports games, but I do like RPGs, MMOs, FPSs, anything else that uses an acronym.

1675
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,640
I'm sorry.

1676
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,640
That was me.

1677
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,000
Anything you guys like, pretty much.

1678
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,560
I also have a few movies in one game, Medal of Honor Heroes.

1679
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,600
Oh, and it's a PSP fap.

1680
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,520
Also my DS has been gathering dust for longer than that, and it's working fine.

1681
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:05,520
Any games we're checking out on that, yeah, for PSP.

1682
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:11,120
Get Final Fantasy I and II for sure, if you like RPGs, those are pretty awesome remakes.

1683
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:18,880
There's also the Metal Gear games that came out on that, the interesting little card games

1684
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,880
that they were.

1685
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,560
Patapon's kind of fun if you like little music games like that.

1686
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,800
Ever extend extra?

1687
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,120
Yeah, the Q games are fun.

1688
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,400
I found your copy again.

1689
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,320
Thank God, bring it back.

1690
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:36,280
And I like Space Invaders Extreme was fun too, but I like those music-y type games.

1691
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,760
As far as UMDs, if you can freaking find any, good luck.

1692
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,880
Whatever movies you like, dude, don't let me tell you what movies you like.

1693
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,540
Yeah, they're kind of hard to find, so good luck with that.

1694
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:55,000
As far as DS goes, definitely in Castlevania Order of Ecclesia, Cooking Mama 2, Dracula

1695
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,560
X Chronicles, that's for PSP.

1696
01:31:57,560 --> 01:32:01,600
Final Fantasy IV, if I'm going to be a Final Fantasy horror, why not?

1697
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,820
Chrono Trigger is coming out, is out, on DS.

1698
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:09,080
So you definitely, Animal Crossing, there's that.

1699
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:14,280
Chatroom's recommending DJ Max if you're a music fan for PSP.

1700
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,640
So there you go, just look online.

1701
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,200
Good times.

1702
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,200
Next email?

1703
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,200
Yes.

1704
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,760
Is, uh, Dear OLR, first of all, Happy New Year.

1705
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,640
Here's to the year not resembling the intake valve of a commercial air compressor.

1706
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:34,000
By that I mean I hope it does not suck nor seem designed to do just that.

1707
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,360
Second, to all the Doctor Who fans in the OLR me, here's an article of interest.

1708
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:43,400
New Doctor is the youngest ever, and yes, I have seen this.

1709
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:48,240
The new Doctor is Tom Green.

1710
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,240
Tom Green is the new Doctor.

1711
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:52,160
Dear God, hell no.

1712
01:32:52,160 --> 01:33:01,040
Matt Smith is an actor I'm not too familiar with, but he is the youngest to ever play

1713
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:02,240
the Doctor.

1714
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:08,600
The second youngest was Peter Davison, who is the fifth Doctor.

1715
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:15,440
And they've, if I'm right, they've actually already started filming for the 2009 series.

1716
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,640
But oh well, I don't know too much about him.

1717
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:23,460
If any of our listeners overseas know more about this guy, send me some of his stuff

1718
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:28,840
so I can see what it is.

1719
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,840
But yeah.

1720
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,120
It says, thank you for your time, Hunter Red, Redertainment.

1721
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:38,160
This message is brought to you by Zap Attack, insert cheap plug here.

1722
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,880
There is some Doctor 11 hate going on in chat.

1723
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,840
Brad from Pod Culture says the casting for Doctor 11 sucks.

1724
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:47,560
I am saying this.

1725
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:54,660
As much of a 10 fan girl I am, I think I'm going to give the guy a chance.

1726
01:33:54,660 --> 01:34:01,040
The only Doctor who was ever an awful Doctor was the sixth Doctor.

1727
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,440
He was scary.

1728
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:09,200
So to me, my favorite Doctor to date is still the fourth Doctor, you know, as much as I

1729
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,200
love 10.

1730
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:15,040
But I also sort of see that dividing line between series.

1731
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,900
We won't even talk about the movie.

1732
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,680
So in other words, we need to give the guy a chance?

1733
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,680
Give him a chance.

1734
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,680
Just give him one episode?

1735
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,680
No.

1736
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,680
To make it good?

1737
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:25,680
Give him the season.

1738
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:26,680
All right.

1739
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,680
Give the guy a chance.

1740
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,120
You don't know until you see them in.

1741
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:38,320
All we are saying, give Matt Smith a chance.

1742
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:45,280
Well, it's just my point is, is you really aren't going to know until you watch it with

1743
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,280
an open mind.

1744
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:51,080
If you watch it expecting him to suck, if you watch it looking for all the faults, you're

1745
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,080
going to see them.

1746
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:57,080
You're not going to enjoy yourself because you're going to be too busy sucking your.

1747
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,380
He's not David Tennant.

1748
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,380
And I wind.

1749
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:01,380
I did wine.

1750
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,480
My first day I wind.

1751
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:08,280
But my opinion is sit back and watch.

1752
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:13,280
You have to watch anyways, because at some point soon Patrick Stewart will be guest starring.

1753
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,560
So that's that's definitely worthwhile.

1754
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:22,180
I think that's probably during one of the special the filler specials next year or this

1755
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:23,180
year rather.

1756
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:26,360
I'm still stuck in last year, but that's still worth watching.

1757
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,840
And I mean, just give it a chance.

1758
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:32,040
I had actually never watched Doctor Who until recently.

1759
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:36,800
And so I guess I'm not as affected by, oh, my God, they're changing him so.

1760
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,240
You can get it in the Netflix instance download on 360.

1761
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,480
I found out pretty cool.

1762
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:45,360
I do have some on there, but I have the all eight seasons of Red Dwarf to go through first.

1763
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,360
So.

1764
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:49,280
Drew Nami is suggesting Loki is the 13th doctor.

1765
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,280
You know, I don't think that will work because he's not.

1766
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,060
I'm not a Doctor Who fan.

1767
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:54,560
He's not very British.

1768
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:00,240
But from what I'm understanding, the episode with Patrick Stewart on is actually going

1769
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:04,440
to be an actual episode, but it's during David Tennant's run still.

1770
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,760
They should just do Simon Pegg as the next doctor.

1771
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:10,000
Simon Pegg has already been in an episode of Doctor Who.

1772
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But not as the doctor.

1773
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,960
No, but he's been in an episode in there.

1774
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:22,080
I would love Simon Pegg as the doctor, but they are very.

1775
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:26,360
They're very continuity conscious.

1776
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:31,040
I like the idea of Doctor Who being a woman or it was Catherine Zeta-Jones.

1777
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,040
Come on.

1778
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,040
I mean, she sold T-Mobile.

1779
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,040
She could sell a TARDIS.

1780
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:35,040
You know what?

1781
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,040
I wish, and sorry, spoilers.

1782
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:41,400
Who cares if Donna took over as the doctor?

1783
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:44,000
John Cleese is the next doctor.

1784
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,440
You know, now I, now I need to.

1785
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,440
That would be awesome.

1786
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:53,960
I need to see Doctor Who and the Curse of the Fatal Death, which is Rowan Atkinson playing

1787
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:54,960
the doctor.

1788
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,500
No, I need to.

1789
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,360
You know who they should cast as the doctor?

1790
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,360
Benny Hill.

1791
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,360
Isn't he dead?

1792
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,360
Exhum him.

1793
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,360
Is Benny Hill dead?

1794
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,360
Probably.

1795
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:10,360
Bono is the next Doctor Who.

1796
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:15,640
Now you've got me all curious if Benny Hill is dead or not.

1797
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:16,640
All right.

1798
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,640
He is.

1799
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,640
All right.

1800
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,000
Let's take our word for it.

1801
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
All right.

1802
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Well, I don't know.

1803
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,720
Make it like a Weekend at Bernie's thing.

1804
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,280
All right.

1805
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,280
Let's move on.

1806
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,240
This show is getting depressing.

1807
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:31,240
So moving on to the last email.

1808
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,800
Christ, he died in 1992.

1809
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:39,280
Where did Horace Hahn's radio bring you the late-breaking news?

1810
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,240
Benny Hill just died.

1811
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:45,240
Today is a tragic day.

1812
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,240
Rob.

1813
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,240
What?

1814
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:50,440
You make me weep.

1815
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:51,440
In my heart.

1816
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,720
Well, I mean, I hadn't seen the guy in a while.

1817
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:57,120
I kind of figured he was probably old and dead.

1818
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,520
I mean, forget it.

1819
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:01,320
Okay, there's people I haven't seen in a while.

1820
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,320
Maybe they're old and dead.

1821
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,320
Okay?

1822
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:10,200
When was the last time you saw Molly Ringwald on TV?

1823
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,200
I haven't seen my mother in a while.

1824
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,400
Actually, I saw her on TV the other day.

1825
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,400
So she's not old and dead.

1826
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,720
My wife watches a lot of ABC Family and Lifetime.

1827
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,560
Okay, what about Ally Sheedy?

1828
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:22,960
Who's Ally Sheedy?

1829
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,520
I haven't seen my mother in a week.

1830
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,520
I hope she's okay.

1831
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,280
Didn't you see the Breakfast Club?

1832
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,200
Oh, I don't know any of their names.

1833
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,800
She was the crazy girl.

1834
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,040
Okay, but I don't know any of their names.

1835
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,720
They're just people in the Breakfast Club.

1836
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:44,240
Vidpower in chat says, rise from your grave, Benny Hill.

1837
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,840
Raoul Julia is the next Benny Hill.

1838
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:48,840
Tim Curry's still alive.

1839
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,840
Tim Curry's still doing stuff.

1840
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:50,840
He did spam a lot.

1841
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:51,840
He will never die.

1842
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,840
He's not old and dead yet.

1843
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:53,840
He's just old.

1844
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,840
And gay.

1845
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:55,840
Next email!

1846
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,840
Yes?

1847
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,760
Hey guys, I have a question for Loki.

1848
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,440
Hey, Loki!

1849
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:04,440
This is AlphaKananagram.

1850
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,440
Just curious.

1851
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:11,720
Right now I'm opening my PSP 2001 Slim and Light comma comma comma and I have stripped

1852
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:16,480
slash have almost stripped the head of one of the top two screws so now I can't try to

1853
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,040
fix my D-pad.

1854
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:21,320
Any suggestions on how to remove the screw or how to fix my D-pad?

1855
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:26,740
It kept going either left or right and sometimes up or down sometimes if I barely touch right

1856
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:27,980
it'll go left.

1857
01:39:27,980 --> 01:39:30,840
This is the first period he's used in the- sorry, the second period he's used in the

1858
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:31,840
entire email.

1859
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,240
Sorry y'all for the grammar.

1860
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:36,000
Really in the bad situation at the moment.

1861
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,660
That's no excuse!

1862
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:39,320
Keep on going AlphaKananagram.

1863
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:44,840
Sounds like a ribbon cable's looser and possibly some of the contacts are dirty.

1864
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:50,600
I mean, shit, like my friend used to play with one of the 360s that we had and for some

1865
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,920
reason his controller had all sorts of crap on it.

1866
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:57,760
It was just like the dirtiest controller I've ever seen and his PSP is the same way.

1867
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:02,480
I don't know if this guy like oozed out oil and crap or whatever but he did.

1868
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:06,400
So yeah, it could be dirty.

1869
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:07,400
So check that.

1870
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,400
Otherwise, I don't know.

1871
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,400
And as far as stripping the screw, hopefully you didn't because that would suck because

1872
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,640
there's not really an easy way to get it out.

1873
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:21,160
What I did with one of mine that was almost stripped is I just didn't put it back in.

1874
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,240
Although you should be able to buy- I think they actually sell some of the replacement

1875
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,240
screws online.

1876
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:30,720
You can buy a kit of like all sorts of miscellaneous parts for the PSP so just buy that.

1877
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:38,120
I replaced a shoulder button for one of my PSPs I think one time with kits similar to

1878
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,120
that.

1879
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:43,560
So that'd be the best way to go.

1880
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,760
Oh and none of those faceplates, the clear ones, ever seem to fit properly which sucks.

1881
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,880
Because I remember trying to put some of those on too.

1882
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,880
The Rob D in chat is trying to say that since I haven't been on TV in a while I'm old and

1883
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:58,400
dead and I'm young and fabulous.

1884
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,400
Tell him that he's wrong.

1885
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,840
WRONG!

1886
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:06,120
And then Rama's trying to piggyback on top of that saying of course Skye would have the

1887
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,040
rainbow colored coffin.

1888
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:11,480
And I'm thinking, they have those?

1889
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:14,720
If there is such a thing, Elton John's got one reserved.

1890
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,720
Really?

1891
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:20,400
Look, all I ask- This is the platform coffin.

1892
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:31,120
All I ask- All I ask is to be buried with my ABBA albums, that's all I ask.

1893
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:36,040
Anyhow- You mean the one ABBA album that you have that lives at my house that we haven't

1894
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:38,000
given you yet?

1895
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Actual album?

1896
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah.

1897
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
You need to bring it over!

1898
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I want it!

1899
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I have that Bette Midler one too.

1900
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Give me my ABBA!

1901
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It's Supertrooper.

1902
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,200
Supertrooper, beams are gonna burn- Alright, anyway.

1903
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Anymore emails?

1904
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:52,200
No!

1905
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:58,520
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

1906
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:06,200
But I think we're to that part of the show where maybe, just maybe, it's about time that

1907
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,680
we give something away!

1908
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:12,720
And we do the match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1909
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,720
Woohoo!

1910
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,720
Aren't we?

1911
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:15,720
No.

1912
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:28,760
I skipped ahead, false alarm, we'll get to the match game in just a little bit.

1913
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:31,520
Live radio, wasn't that an ultimate tease?

1914
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,120
I'm like, no we're not?

1915
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:37,640
I might want to edit that later if I remember.

1916
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:38,640
We'll see.

1917
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:39,640
We'll pretend it didn't happen.

1918
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:41,080
We'll just pretend that didn't happen.

1919
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,360
Let's move on with some more gaming stories.

1920
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,360
Alright.

1921
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:51,840
Well, speaking of how the Playstation 3 was uber awesome in internet browsing, well, the

1922
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,560
Playstation 3 has been used to break the internet as well.

1923
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:05,160
In fact, a cluster of Playstation 3s, 200 to be exact, linked together, were able to do

1924
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:10,000
the math to help decrypt the MD5 hash used in VeriSign.

1925
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:17,200
So yes, if you have 200 PS3s lying around linked together, you too can crack supposedly

1926
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:24,240
uncrackable encryption, hurrah.

1927
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,200
So they're not really worried that anybody's going to crack this other than obviously this

1928
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:34,880
research team, because really, who's sitting on 200 PS3s other than Sony?

1929
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:35,880
Nobody.

1930
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:36,880
Nobody.

1931
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:44,080
There's all those other research labs, remember?

1932
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:47,080
The ones that are actually trying to cure cancer?

1933
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,560
Yeah, my PS3 cures cancer.

1934
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:50,560
It's awesome.

1935
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:56,000
Well, hey, I can't buy PS3 games at airports yet, but now you can buy, well, I guess I

1936
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,440
might, but depending on the airport, I actually probably could, but now you can buy a Nintendo

1937
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:04,440
DS and DS games in airports out of a vending machine.

1938
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:08,160
Yeah, these vending machines are pretty high end, but you know, I guess we've seen these

1939
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:12,120
types of vending machines before that have kind of the really uber expensive stuff.

1940
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,120
Like I know they're in Vegas.

1941
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,120
You see them, right?

1942
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:17,720
Don't you see these things in Vegas, casinos and stuff, like iPods and all that stuff?

1943
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:24,120
Well, now they have these fancy vending machines with expensive DS games and Nintendo DSs in

1944
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:25,120
them.

1945
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:32,060
Apparently, it's something that Best Buy is doing, and it's at a Best Buy Express vending

1946
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,060
machine.

1947
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:36,640
These things are at a couple of the different airports throughout the US.

1948
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:41,240
Not only, though, should I point out that they sell the DS and DS games, they sell headphones,

1949
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,420
chargers, and so on.

1950
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:46,920
Now I want to point out, though, that if you've ever flown before, you'll know you actually

1951
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,120
don't want to use the DS, though, during landing and take off.

1952
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,120
It's bad.

1953
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:53,960
And you could crash the plane and get- no, not really, but they'd get really angry at

1954
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:56,680
you when you do that, so only use it when it's safe.

1955
01:44:56,680 --> 01:45:00,140
It's kind of neat that they have these sort of kiosks.

1956
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:02,680
We did see one for Sony and stuff.

1957
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:08,160
Unfortunately, there's also a chain of stores called- oh gosh, now I can't remember what

1958
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,160
the name is.

1959
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:10,160
Airtunes, right?

1960
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:15,080
Not Airtunes, but it's- I don't remember what they're called anyways, but they have a chain

1961
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,920
that's in every single airport that's out there right now, and they also sell the exact

1962
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:24,480
same stuff, and in case you're worried about putting in your credit card and spending hundreds

1963
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:31,400
of dollars on DS systems and stuff like that, and possibly getting stuck in this vending

1964
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,400
machine-

1965
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,400
That's what I was going to say.

1966
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,400
What happens if the little thing turns and it doesn't fall out?

1967
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,880
Can you imagine me sitting there shaking this vending machine with $100 worth of merchandise?

1968
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,240
I'm sure there's alarms on it and all.

1969
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:49,040
But you can actually go to the store and purchase these games face-to-face with people, so I

1970
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:52,480
don't really see the point of why they have this in there, other than another place you

1971
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:53,960
can buy the same shit.

1972
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:54,960
Impulse Buy.

1973
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,520
Mommy, I want one!

1974
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,920
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

1975
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:01,840
Leo Shen calls it a Super Plane Crasher DS.

1976
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,880
Black Wolf says, now do the DS's come already charged, or do you have to charge it in the

1977
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,000
airport before you get on the plane?

1978
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,600
And Rama says his did come charged already.

1979
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,880
Have the DS's come charged in the box?

1980
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:17,960
From what I remember, my original DS, and I think my DS, I think I had to charge both

1981
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:18,960
of those.

1982
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:19,960
Did you?

1983
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:20,960
Hahaha!

1984
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:21,960
Sucks for them.

1985
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:25,600
Yeah, because then how do you charge them before you get on the plane?

1986
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:30,160
Of course, then, you know, airports, it's really easy to charge a laptop at an airport.

1987
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:31,160
There's plugs everywhere.

1988
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,880
Yeah, but you cannot have the convenience or time to do that.

1989
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:38,120
And better yet, I mean, really, do you really want to buy electronics at an airport?

1990
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:41,920
I mean, I can understand a game, you know, I bought headphones because my headphones

1991
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:47,200
sucked because I had these stupid earbuds and I wanted something different, but, really,

1992
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:52,000
a DS system, you're like, hey, you know, I really wish I had DS.

1993
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,380
I think this is more for, like, gifts and stuff like that, like, crap, I gotta get my

1994
01:46:56,380 --> 01:47:02,040
son a gift, and I am stupid and didn't think about getting him anything.

1995
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:05,920
Oh, hey, look, a vending machine, let me buy some useless crap.

1996
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:12,160
Yeah, the problem is they also have porn in the airport, and that's very sad.

1997
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:15,000
Well, because, you know, you shouldn't be looking at porn on a plane.

1998
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,800
That's not going to crash a plane that does not interfere with their taking off or landing.

1999
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,880
Yeah, but there might be children sitting behind you.

2000
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:21,880
Screw the children.

2001
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:22,880
No thank you.

2002
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,600
Unless you're sitting in the very back row by yourself, then you can look at all the

2003
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,600
porn you want.

2004
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,840
Wait, wait, wait, if you get a, if you can, if they sell a PSP, you can look up porn on

2005
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,960
the PSP, because we all know the PSP is a gateway to porn.

2006
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,240
But you can't look at the internet while you're on a fucking airplane.

2007
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:42,400
Ah, but you can put pictures and encode videos onto your memory.

2008
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,400
All at the airport?

2009
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,400
Yes, all at the airport.

2010
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,400
Seriously.

2011
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:54,520
If you're going to go to that extreme lengths of trouble just to look at porn, why don't

2012
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,360
you just bring a Playboy on the goddamn plane?

2013
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:00,000
And you know what else you could do, too, is use one of those TV devices that they had,

2014
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,160
remember those wonderful TV devices that they don't sell anymore, that act like a projector,

2015
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:08,440
and project it onto the ceiling of the cabin.

2016
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,440
You have issues.

2017
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,160
Alright.

2018
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,840
Anyhow, let's move on.

2019
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:18,680
We have one more story before we get to match game tonight.

2020
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:22,720
Well, I like Legos.

2021
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:25,080
And I like Rock Band.

2022
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:29,640
And there's a rumor going around that those are two great tastes that taste great together.

2023
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,480
Tastes great.

2024
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,480
Less filling.

2025
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:34,480
Tastes great.

2026
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,480
Less...

2027
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:41,800
So, yeah, the rumor is that there is going to be a Lego Rock Band.

2028
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,880
That's all I can say.

2029
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:47,800
There's no confirmation.

2030
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,840
There's a...

2031
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,320
Some dude's uncle works for Lego and heard, right?

2032
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,880
There's supposed to be a Lego title coming out.

2033
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:02,640
But Lego Rock Band, dude, can't they find something...

2034
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,640
I guess it's not the dumbest rumor I've ever heard.

2035
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:08,880
Wasn't there a White Stripes video made completely out of Legos, if I remember right?

2036
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,120
I think.

2037
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:14,200
That's the only thing I could think of that could possibly tie into Legos and Rock Band.

2038
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,200
This is bunk.

2039
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,200
It's gotta be bullshit.

2040
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,200
It's gotta be.

2041
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,360
And you know why this is completely bunk?

2042
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:22,240
Is because you have to understand the way they make Lego games.

2043
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:26,300
For example, it's a specific chain of events.

2044
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:32,880
You have the toy that they make first, then you make the video game.

2045
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,040
Just like they've had, you know, I believe they have the Lego Indiana Jones toys.

2046
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,480
I know they have the Lego Star Wars toys.

2047
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:45,200
I know that they have the Lego Racer toys and stuff like that.

2048
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:50,980
So the next logical step for me, and seeing as that the rumor is EA is going to be publishing

2049
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:58,320
it would be Lego Harry Potter, because, you know, they need another Lego game, and that

2050
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:03,160
makes perfect sense for me that they would be able to pump out two more Lego games based

2051
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:07,680
around the Harry Potter movies, and they already have toys to go along with it.

2052
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:13,360
So Rock Band wouldn't make any sense at all because there's no reason for them to buy...

2053
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:18,520
Why would you even want to, I mean, you'd have to make special peripherals for it.

2054
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,080
There's no Lego themed music to go along with it.

2055
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:25,660
It would just be like a reskin of Rock Band.

2056
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:28,460
It would be kind of crap, is what it would be.

2057
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:33,560
It would be not kind of crap, it would be totally crap.

2058
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:37,120
Tiger Claw is suggesting Lego Transformers would be another logical step.

2059
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,600
But see, they don't have a toy for that.

2060
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:42,000
Remember it's toy, then game.

2061
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,800
It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, the game.

2062
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:51,240
Like they're not going to just all of a sudden make, you know, Lego Halo or something like

2063
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:52,240
that.

2064
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,280
Unless they make Lego Halo toys first.

2065
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:57,800
It's toy in game, because Lego's not going to just put their license out there unless

2066
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,540
they have something to benefit from it.

2067
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:02,760
Now you know what this has started in the chat room.

2068
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:12,080
Now we have Frisbee says Lego of Persia, Bricks of Time, GS68 says BeatMania 2DX Legos, GS68

2069
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:19,640
says Imagine Legos, Drew, even though he's sitting right behind me, says Lego Crisis,

2070
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:24,480
Lego International Superstar Soccer, Lego on a Prayer, Lego Sonic the Hedgehog, Little

2071
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,960
Big Legos.

2072
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:33,880
Anyhow, now that's a good question from Kazam is what about the Lego MMO?

2073
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:35,960
That's a good question.

2074
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:37,600
Orange Lego Radio?

2075
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,480
Alright, forget it, cooking Legos.

2076
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:41,480
Alright, forget it.

2077
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:42,480
Enough.

2078
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:43,480
Stop.

2079
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,480
Knock it off.

2080
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:47,680
We have something much better to look forward to.

2081
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:51,360
We are now going to play the match game.

2082
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,360
Yes, I'm sure we're going to play the match game.

2083
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:58,020
Tonight for the match game we have five fabulous celebrities joining us in the studio.

2084
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:02,280
Say hello to the one and only Loki.

2085
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:08,760
Hello and to Pod Culture in the, or Brad from Pod Culture.

2086
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:11,540
There is no Lego Transformer toys.

2087
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:15,160
There are Transformer toys, but not Lego Transformer toys.

2088
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,520
Alright, whatever.

2089
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,360
Also, say hello to Intern Drew, who is one of our other fabulous celebrity panelists

2090
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,360
tonight.

2091
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,360
Yo, what's up?

2092
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:29,240
And also joining us, say hello to Dark Soccer on the celebrity panel.

2093
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:33,280
And also on our celebrity panel tonight, Giggling Girl Sauce.

2094
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,960
Giggling Gamer Geek Girls Unite.

2095
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:36,960
Yay!

2096
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,960
Activate.

2097
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:46,120
Alright, and of course, also on the celebrity panel tonight, the most fabulous of them all,

2098
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:47,120
me.

2099
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:50,800
Alright, let's get to tonight's match game.

2100
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:56,280
First off, we have nine people who caught my uber secret message in chat to send me

2101
01:52:56,280 --> 01:53:03,200
a tell to play, so if you wouldn't mind sauce, pick a number between one and nine.

2102
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,200
Lucky number seven.

2103
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:08,440
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2104
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:12,200
The seventh person to send me a tell tonight was X-Link.

2105
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:18,920
So X-Link is going to play from chat.

2106
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:21,600
And I'm telling him to please stand by.

2107
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:25,360
We'll need to explain the rules for match game while I open up the Skype line to the

2108
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:31,080
first person to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if

2109
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:36,040
you want to play against X-Link for that $25 gift certificate.

2110
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:41,800
Alright, somebody explain the rules of match game, hurry.

2111
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:42,800
Dark Sakura.

2112
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:48,440
We're reading a bunch of crap, and it ends, but it ends incomplete and you gotta complete

2113
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,440
it.

2114
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,440
With a word.

2115
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:51,440
Or phrase.

2116
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,440
Sorry, go ahead.

2117
01:53:52,440 --> 01:54:00,960
Like if I said, I went to the blank, you'd have to pick something.

2118
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,960
And X-Link just told me he has no idea how to play, so this should be fun tonight.

2119
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,200
You have to try and match what we are thinking.

2120
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,960
Yes, you gotta match what we are thinking.

2121
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:13,120
We're gonna send you something with a blank in it, and you tell me over private message

2122
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,680
what you think should be in the blank.

2123
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:17,520
Oh, and good luck.

2124
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,880
Hurry up and go to YouTube and type in Match Game 76.

2125
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,980
There's no time, there's no time.

2126
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:25,320
We do have a caller on the Skype line.

2127
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:26,680
Hi caller, who's this?

2128
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:30,240
Hi, this is Ronma, aka DJ Ronma.

2129
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,240
They're gonna say it's rigged.

2130
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:32,240
They're gonna say it's rigged.

2131
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:38,840
No way, he's got mad skills, and it's fitting he should be our first phone contestant of

2132
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:39,840
the year.

2133
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,360
He has a flaming finger when it comes to dialing.

2134
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,360
So there you go.

2135
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:47,160
Alright, now Ronma, do you know how to play Match Game?

2136
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:51,480
Ronma, do you know how to play Match Game?

2137
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,080
Why, yes I do.

2138
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,800
Why yes you do, alright.

2139
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,480
Can you explain X-Link how to play?

2140
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:06,240
Damn it, I hosted a Match Game one time, I can't remember, oh god, I'm so sorry.

2141
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:07,240
That's alright.

2142
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:09,480
Fill in the blank with what you think we're gonna say.

2143
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,480
That's the best way we can explain it.

2144
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:18,560
Okay, so the winner tonight will get a $25 gift certificate to Amazon.com courtesy of

2145
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:21,600
Avengers Tower, your favorite giggling game girl blog.

2146
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,160
No, I shouldn't keep saying that because then people are gonna think that's really true,

2147
01:55:24,160 --> 01:55:27,840
but it's actually, it's irony because if you go read it, it's actually very well thought

2148
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:28,940
out and very well done.

2149
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:31,440
It's irony, it's a case of irony.

2150
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:37,480
And the loser tonight gets their face melted off with an Xbox 360 laser gun, so don't lose.

2151
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:40,040
Alright, sound good, Ronma?

2152
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:41,040
Works for me.

2153
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,040
Alright.

2154
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:47,640
The whole chat room is yelling, rigged, rigged.

2155
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:52,000
Do you have anything to say to the chat room before we begin tonight?

2156
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,720
I'm sorry, I can't help but have the fastest internet connection in the chat.

2157
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:57,720
Alright, oh snap.

2158
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,160
Alright, here we go.

2159
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,160
Question number one tonight.

2160
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,200
Are you ready for question number one?

2161
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,640
Now don't say the answer because we all have to write down here in studio and if you blurred

2162
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:09,320
it out, then you automatically lose and get shot in the face with an Xbox 360 zapper,

2163
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:10,320
okay?

2164
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,480
Alright, so here is question number one tonight.

2165
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:17,080
And XLink, you send me your answer over a private message.

2166
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:20,820
Dark Sakura, as you know, no you're in the question.

2167
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:25,440
Dark Sakura, as you know, doesn't like to sing in front of people.

2168
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,940
She snubs SingStar and laughs at lips.

2169
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:35,000
The whole reason for this is that she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing

2170
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:41,840
For Your Blank.

2171
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:44,600
Dark Sakura is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game.

2172
01:56:44,600 --> 01:56:47,640
It's called Sing For Your Blank.

2173
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:51,960
Everyone here in studio is trying to cook up an answer and just say ding when you're

2174
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:55,560
done so I know you have it.

2175
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:58,240
Dark Sakura burped.

2176
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:02,040
Okay, ding.

2177
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:03,720
I changed my answer last minute.

2178
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:04,720
Ah, ding.

2179
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:05,720
Ding and Tiara?

2180
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,080
Alright, Tiara, ding.

2181
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:10,040
I'm just waiting for our chatroom contestant to give an answer.

2182
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,720
Rama, do you know an answer yet?

2183
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:12,720
Yes, I do.

2184
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:13,720
Ding.

2185
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:14,720
Alright.

2186
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:21,480
I'm waiting on our chatroom contestant, XLink.

2187
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,760
Can you send me something?

2188
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:25,760
I just typed hurry.

2189
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,360
Okay, there we go.

2190
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,360
We have an answer.

2191
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:30,880
Alright.

2192
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,560
Sometimes it could be the obvious answer, sometimes it's not obvious.

2193
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:34,560
Alright.

2194
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,720
The whole reason for this is that she's waiting for an ultimate karaoke game called Sing For

2195
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:38,720
Your...

2196
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:39,720
Rama?

2197
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:40,720
Sing For Your...

2198
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:41,720
Alcohol.

2199
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:45,300
Sing For Your Alcohol, says Rama.

2200
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:50,120
Our chatter, XLink, says she is waiting for the ultimate karaoke game called Sing For

2201
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:53,120
Your Life, says the chatter.

2202
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:54,320
Sing For Your Life.

2203
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:57,720
Alright, DarkSakura, we'll start with you on this question.

2204
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:01,480
Sing For Your...

2205
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:02,680
We already have a match.

2206
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:03,680
What is it?

2207
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:04,680
I was gonna say booze.

2208
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,680
Sing For Your Booze.

2209
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:08,280
Oh my gosh, this game's super rigged tonight.

2210
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:10,320
Rama already got a point.

2211
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,720
Alright, well, let's see what happens.

2212
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,400
Rama, you're on the board with a point.

2213
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:14,400
Congratulations.

2214
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,400
Sing For Your Booze.

2215
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:16,400
We have a match.

2216
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,400
Yay, match.

2217
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,400
Yay.

2218
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:19,400
That's amazing.

2219
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:22,920
This is the first time in the history of this game, we matched on the very first answer

2220
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:27,560
because we go through, we've gone through games and games where nobody ever matches

2221
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:29,300
a goddamn thing.

2222
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:31,120
This is epic match game tonight.

2223
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:34,280
Sauce, she made a karaoke game called Sing For Your...

2224
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:37,640
I think this will possibly count for a match.

2225
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,600
I said Sing For Your Survival.

2226
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:42,720
Please remove that shotgun from my head.

2227
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,400
Sing For Your Survival.

2228
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,400
Will we count it?

2229
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,400
Yeah.

2230
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,880
No, we're gonna count it as a match, yay.

2231
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,960
So now it's tied up.

2232
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:51,080
One for Rama.

2233
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:52,080
One for X-Link.

2234
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:53,080
Okay, Loki.

2235
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:54,240
Sing For Your...

2236
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:55,240
Life.

2237
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:56,240
Oh!

2238
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,280
X-Link pulls ahead with two.

2239
01:58:58,280 --> 01:58:59,280
Sing For Your Life.

2240
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,280
Two to one.

2241
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:04,840
I couldn't think of anything so, you know, that's the first thing that I came up with.

2242
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:05,840
Alright.

2243
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:07,320
Trying to be clever.

2244
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:08,320
Drunami.

2245
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,840
Sing For Your...

2246
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:10,840
Guardian Legend Remake.

2247
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,480
Guardian Legend Remake.

2248
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:15,360
Oh, good, but not a match.

2249
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,400
And I said, I don't think this is gonna be a match.

2250
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,120
I said Sing For Your Child's Freedom.

2251
01:59:20,120 --> 01:59:21,120
Also...

2252
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:24,360
Does Jamie really play that?

2253
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:25,360
Well, it's...

2254
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:28,800
I don't know if Jamie would play it, but like, I don't know, it would be something I could

2255
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:31,200
see that they would have at Golf Land, so there you have it.

2256
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,000
Sing For Your Child's Freedom.

2257
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Unfortunately not a match.

2258
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
You alright there, Jamie?

2259
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Alright.

2260
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Dork.

2261
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,040
Alright, here we go.

2262
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:42,520
So it's X-Link 2, Rama 1.

2263
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:45,600
Alright, so Rama, I don't know if it's rigged.

2264
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,600
We'll see.

2265
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:47,600
Oh, yeah.

2266
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:48,600
Alright, Rama.

2267
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:49,600
You have four.

2268
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:50,600
It's an epic match game tonight.

2269
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:51,680
There's four more chances to catch up.

2270
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:52,960
Here we go.

2271
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,080
Question number two.

2272
01:59:55,080 --> 02:00:02,040
Rob, hey, that's me, is planning early for this year's E3.

2273
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:06,560
He already reserved his plane tickets and his tickets to the show.

2274
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:12,240
When asked why he was going so early, he exclaimed, I'm just so excited to go back this year and

2275
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:14,240
see all the blank.

2276
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:17,240
Ding!

2277
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:33,640
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

2278
02:00:33,640 --> 02:01:01,360
I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the booth babes.

2279
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:10,360
booth babes says Rama. X-link says I'm just so excited to go back this year and see all the games.

2280
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:17,360
That seems like a pretty fucking obvious answer, right? Let's see, I don't know, let's see.

2281
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:24,360
Did we go for the obvious or did we go for crazy? I don't know, let's see.

2282
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:28,360
We'll start again with Dark Sakura. I can't wait to go and see all the...

2283
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:34,360
Fanboy Wank. Fanboy Wank.

2284
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:37,360
I don't think technically that's a match, I'm sorry.

2285
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,360
Sauce, I can't wait to go back and see all the...

2286
02:01:40,360 --> 02:01:45,360
Previews for Sing Star Journey. Previews for Sing Star Journey.

2287
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:50,360
I don't think that's a match with games. Games is too broad, but that's a good, that's a very good answer.

2288
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:52,360
Very good, you know me very well.

2289
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:59,360
Loki, he can't wait to go back and see the... This is totally opposite of what you'd probably say anyways, but I said...

2290
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:04,360
All the Paris Hilton games. All the Paris Hilton games, ew.

2291
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:09,360
Maybe in an alternate universe. Does that match with just games though? I don't, I don't think it does.

2292
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:12,360
I'm sorry, sorry X-links, too, too, too broad.

2293
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,360
Alright, uh...

2294
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:22,360
Drewnami, can't wait to go back and see all the... Fucking ABBA music games. Fucking ABBA music games.

2295
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:24,360
Alright, good answer, but not a match.

2296
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:28,360
And I said, now this is going to be tricky, okay, here's what I said. I said...

2297
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:32,360
Rob said, I can't wait to go back and see all the...

2298
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:37,360
Military men, is what I said. But does that count for booth babes?

2299
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,360
I think so. You think so?

2300
02:02:40,360 --> 02:02:44,360
Yeah. That's like a booth babe for me.

2301
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:47,360
Yeah, babe can go either way.

2302
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:51,360
Babe can go either way. Alright, Rama, we're going to give you a point for matching on that one.

2303
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,360
Even though you got the wrong gender.

2304
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,360
Woohoo!

2305
02:02:56,360 --> 02:03:00,360
Who cares about gender here on Orange Lounge Radio? Alright.

2306
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:02,360
There we go, we gave him a point for that.

2307
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:07,360
Alright, so it's all tied up and the chat room is complaining that it's rigged.

2308
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:10,360
Hey, it's my gift card. I can tell if it counts or not.

2309
02:03:10,360 --> 02:03:13,360
That's right. There you go. Oh snap.

2310
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:17,360
You just got, the chat room, you just got served by a giggling geek girl.

2311
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:19,360
I just want to point out.

2312
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:23,360
Alright. Anyhow, let's get to question number three.

2313
02:03:23,360 --> 02:03:25,360
And you know it's a Loki question.

2314
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:30,360
Alright, here we go. Question number three in tonight's match game, epic match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2315
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:36,360
Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

2316
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:39,360
He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

2317
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:46,360
They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.

2318
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:59,360
Alright, Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

2319
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:02,360
He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

2320
02:04:02,360 --> 02:04:08,360
They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of blank in your level.

2321
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,360
I ding.

2322
02:04:16,360 --> 02:04:18,360
I'm going to ding.

2323
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:27,360
Alright, Rama, did you ding?

2324
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:28,360
Ding?

2325
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:29,360
Alright, here we go.

2326
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:32,360
Loki just published his own level on LittleBigPlanet this week.

2327
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:34,360
He was pissed off though when his level got moderated.

2328
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:39,360
They sent him a message saying, Loki, you can't have pictures of erotica.

2329
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,360
Erotica.

2330
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:45,360
Alright, and X-Link said, nude ladies.

2331
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,360
So, it's almost the same thing.

2332
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:50,360
So, this is just playing for points at this point, racking up the points.

2333
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:55,360
So, Dark Sakura, you can't have pictures of big black cock.

2334
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:57,360
Big black cock.

2335
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:00,360
Not a match and erotica is too broad.

2336
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:01,360
What?

2337
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:03,360
Sorry, that's not a match.

2338
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,360
Sorry, that's not a match.

2339
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:06,360
Loki has firmly said that's not a match.

2340
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:09,360
Alright, Tiara, you can't have pictures of?

2341
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:11,360
Iraqi suicide babies.

2342
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,360
Iraqi suicide babies.

2343
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:16,360
That is actually the first thing I put down and I changed it.

2344
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:17,360
That's amazing.

2345
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,360
Alright, not a match.

2346
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:25,360
But you know, if I am going to make a level, it will have Iraqi suicide babies in there.

2347
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:29,360
Alright, Loki, you can't have pictures of?

2348
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,360
Um, blood and tits.

2349
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:34,360
That's what I put in mine.

2350
02:05:34,360 --> 02:05:35,360
Blood and tits.

2351
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,360
Blood and tits.

2352
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:37,360
That's fairly erotic.

2353
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:44,360
But I feel like if we're going to give it to Rama, then we also need to give it to X-Link for nude ladies.

2354
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:46,360
Alright, so why not? We'll give them both a point.

2355
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,360
Why not?

2356
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:49,360
Alright, yay, a point for everybody.

2357
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:51,360
Yay, blood and tits.

2358
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:56,360
Alright, Drew, you can't have pictures of?

2359
02:05:56,360 --> 02:05:58,360
Iraqi suicide babies.

2360
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:00,360
Iraqi suicide babies.

2361
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:04,360
And my answer was, you can't have pictures of?

2362
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:06,360
Cylon occupied Caprica.

2363
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:08,360
Because it's copyrighted.

2364
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:10,360
See, I went from one OLR joke to another.

2365
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:11,360
That's what I did.

2366
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,360
There you go.

2367
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:15,360
You can't have pictures of Cylon occupied Caprica.

2368
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:18,360
But see, Iraqi suicide babies is not copyrighted.

2369
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:21,360
But Cylon occupied Caprica is. That's why I changed it.

2370
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,360
I'll put a fucking copyright on it.

2371
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:24,360
Alright.

2372
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,360
Alright.

2373
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:30,360
I love some of the answers the chatroom came up with here.

2374
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:31,360
This is great.

2375
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,360
Two men kissing was one of them.

2376
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:37,360
Uh, pictures of Sky's old public access show.

2377
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:38,360
Tingle.

2378
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:40,360
I didn't even think of that one. That's a great one.

2379
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:41,360
Tingle penis.

2380
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,360
Lego tingle.

2381
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:46,360
I have judgement.

2382
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:47,360
Alright, good job.

2383
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,360
Alright.

2384
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,360
We have more.

2385
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:52,360
Rama, it's all tied up. How you feeling?

2386
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:54,360
I feel the pressure's on me.

2387
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,360
The pressure is fucking on.

2388
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,360
Alright, here we go.

2389
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:59,360
Question number four.

2390
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:01,360
Now they're not about the host anymore.

2391
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,360
This is gonna get out there a little bit.

2392
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:04,360
Alright.

2393
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:09,360
Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.

2394
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:11,360
That's right, we're gonna be having a rave.

2395
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:17,360
However, instead of a cuddle room, they'll have a blank room.

2396
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:36,360
Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.

2397
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:41,360
However, instead of a cuddle room, they'll have a blank room.

2398
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:48,360
Ding.

2399
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,360
Alright.

2400
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,360
Rama, did you ding?

2401
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:53,360
Ding.

2402
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:55,360
Alright, I'm just waiting on our chatter.

2403
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,360
Alright.

2404
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,360
Oh my god.

2405
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:05,360
Alright.

2406
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:06,360
Wow.

2407
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:09,360
That's what happens when the pressure's on.

2408
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,360
I'll read his answer in a minute.

2409
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:12,360
Alright.

2410
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:13,360
Orange...

2411
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,360
Wow.

2412
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:16,360
What kind of raves do you think we have?

2413
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:20,360
Alright, Orange Lounge Radio is getting ready to host its first ever rave.

2414
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:24,360
However, instead of a cuddle room, they will have a...

2415
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,360
Pyramid Head room.

2416
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:27,360
Pyramid Head room.

2417
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,360
Alright, well maybe that's where this answer comes from.

2418
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,360
What time is it?

2419
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:35,360
X-Link says they will have a rape room.

2420
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:39,360
Okay.

2421
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:43,360
I know, that's why I gaffed in horror when I read the answer.

2422
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:48,360
Well, let's see if Pyramid Head or rape, or preferably both, comes up.

2423
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:49,360
So let's see.

2424
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:51,360
Dark Sakura, they will have a...

2425
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:52,360
Fanboy wank.

2426
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:54,360
Fanboy wank room.

2427
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:58,360
That almost is Pyramid Head, almost, but not quite.

2428
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:01,360
Alright, Sauce, they will have a...

2429
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:02,360
Drunken Booze room.

2430
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:05,360
Drunken Booze room, of course you gotta have a drunk room.

2431
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:07,360
I advocate this.

2432
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:10,360
Alright, Loki, the OLR rave will have a...

2433
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,360
Light switch rave room.

2434
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:14,360
Light switch rave room.

2435
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:16,360
That's a damn good answer, good job.

2436
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,360
Drew, they will have a...

2437
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:20,360
A champagne room.

2438
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,360
A champagne room.

2439
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:24,360
No, there's champagne in the champagne room.

2440
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,360
You ass.

2441
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,360
Alright.

2442
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:31,360
And I said that they will have a...

2443
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:33,360
Gun room.

2444
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,360
Come on, cause you all have guns.

2445
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:38,360
Of course there's gonna be a gun room.

2446
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:39,360
Alright.

2447
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,360
Still tied up, 3-3.

2448
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,360
What the hell happens if we have a tie?

2449
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,360
Oh shit.

2450
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:47,360
We have to play all night long until the tie is broken.

2451
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:48,360
It's like baseball.

2452
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,360
Alright, here we go.

2453
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,360
Shit.

2454
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:51,360
Alright.

2455
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:54,360
Alright.

2456
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:58,360
Here we go with the last question tonight, which hopefully someone will match on.

2457
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,360
Here we go.

2458
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:06,360
Little did you know that Drew Nami is here tonight to steal your prize.

2459
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:12,360
Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on blank.

2460
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:15,360
Ding.

2461
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:18,360
Little did you know that Drew is here tonight to steal your prize.

2462
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:24,360
Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on blank.

2463
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:26,360
Ding.

2464
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:30,360
Ding.

2465
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:32,360
Did you ding Dark Sock right in here?

2466
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:33,360
I did.

2467
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:34,360
Alright.

2468
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:35,360
I think everybody's dinged.

2469
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:36,360
I think I heard Rama ding.

2470
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,360
That was quick.

2471
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:38,360
Yep.

2472
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:43,360
Alright.

2473
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:46,360
Rama, little did you know that Drew is here tonight to steal your prize.

2474
02:10:46,360 --> 02:10:50,360
Yes, he told me in secret that he was planning on spending your gift card on...

2475
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:51,360
Warcraft.

2476
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,360
Warcraft.

2477
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:59,360
And X-Link says he was planning on spending the gift card on porn.

2478
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:00,360
Pornography.

2479
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:01,360
Alright, let's see.

2480
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:04,360
We got two pretty extreme different answers there.

2481
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:06,360
This could make all the difference.

2482
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:07,360
Dark Sakura.

2483
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:10,360
He's spending the gift card on...

2484
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:11,360
Porn.

2485
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:12,360
Porn!

2486
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:15,360
Ooh, X-Link pulls ahead, but it's not over yet.

2487
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:17,360
It's not over yet.

2488
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:18,360
Alright.

2489
02:11:18,360 --> 02:11:20,360
Sauce.

2490
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:24,360
She said she couldn't use fanboy wank again.

2491
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:25,360
Alright.

2492
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:29,360
Sauce, he's gonna spend the gift card on...

2493
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:31,360
I actually did say Warcraft.

2494
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:32,360
Warcraft.

2495
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:34,360
Oh man, it's tied again.

2496
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:36,360
Oh man, it's back to 4-4.

2497
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:37,360
Let's see.

2498
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:38,360
Alright.

2499
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:39,360
Amazing.

2500
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:40,360
Alright, Loki.

2501
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:42,360
He's gonna spend the gift card on...

2502
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:44,360
I didn't say either of those.

2503
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:46,360
I said Better Joke Books.

2504
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:47,360
Better Joke Books.

2505
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,360
Oh, he might need that.

2506
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:50,360
Alright.

2507
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:52,360
So, uh, Drew?

2508
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:54,360
It's come down to you and me.

2509
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,360
Maybe one of us matches.

2510
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:56,360
He's gonna...

2511
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:57,360
You want me to go first?

2512
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,360
I think you should.

2513
02:11:58,360 --> 02:11:59,360
Alright, you think I should?

2514
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:03,360
Alright, I said he's gonna spend his gift card on...

2515
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,360
A life.

2516
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:06,360
Boo.

2517
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:08,360
But I put a heart next to it, so it's okay.

2518
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:09,360
It's just a joke.

2519
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,360
But he's gonna spend his gift card on actually getting a life.

2520
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,360
I'm just kidding.

2521
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:13,360
Love you, bro.

2522
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,360
Alright.

2523
02:12:14,360 --> 02:12:17,360
Drew, he's gonna spend the gift card on...

2524
02:12:17,360 --> 02:12:25,360
Getting Kim to California, you fucking perverts.

2525
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:27,360
So the match came in tonight in a tie.

2526
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:28,360
What do we do in case of a tie?

2527
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:29,360
Lie Radio.

2528
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:30,360
Do we have to do another question?

2529
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:33,360
No, I get the gift card just as planned.

2530
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:34,360
No, no, Drew.

2531
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:35,360
I'll do one, I'll do one, I'll do one.

2532
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:36,360
You're gonna do one?

2533
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:37,360
I'll do one, I'll do one.

2534
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:38,360
Alright, one more question.

2535
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:39,360
This is coming from...

2536
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:41,360
Completely off the top of my head.

2537
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:42,360
I'm a little worried about this one.

2538
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:45,360
You have to talk fast, because I have to message it to X-Link, okay?

2539
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,360
Okay.

2540
02:12:46,360 --> 02:12:47,360
Alright, go.

2541
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:53,360
During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up

2542
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:57,360
another question for match game.

2543
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:03,360
So instead, they decided to settle the tie by a blank.

2544
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:14,360
I repeat, if I can remember, during an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, they had a tie in

2545
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:20,360
the match game, and they couldn't think up another question, so they had to solve the

2546
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:25,360
tie by a blank.

2547
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:28,360
Ding.

2548
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:31,360
Ding.

2549
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:37,360
I don't know, how do you guys get your answers so fast?

2550
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:43,360
Because I did the obvious answer.

2551
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:49,360
Don't be giving things away.

2552
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:51,360
Just kidding, I didn't...

2553
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:52,360
Just kidding.

2554
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:57,360
I wouldn't say that, it's retarded.

2555
02:13:57,360 --> 02:14:01,360
God, I don't know.

2556
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:14,360
Okay, I've typed out my answer, it's long and dramatic.

2557
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:18,360
Alright, I'm waiting on X-Link.

2558
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:21,360
During an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, there was a tie, and they couldn't think up

2559
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:26,360
another question for match game, so instead they decided to settle a tie by a blank.

2560
02:14:26,360 --> 02:14:30,360
Uh, which I'm waiting on X-Link still.

2561
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:38,360
La la, la la, match game music, match game music, porn porn, blank blank.

2562
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:45,360
I'm reading some of the comments in chat, they're pretty bad.

2563
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:46,360
Butt sex battle?

2564
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:47,360
Really?

2565
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:49,360
Really?

2566
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:50,360
Alright.

2567
02:14:50,360 --> 02:14:52,360
Come on!

2568
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:56,360
It's by, uh, inflammation.

2569
02:14:56,360 --> 02:14:59,360
To see who's more inflamed.

2570
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:00,360
Is he still in chat?

2571
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:02,360
Or did we scare him off?

2572
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:06,360
Are you there?

2573
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:08,360
Do we have an answer?

2574
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:10,360
I like what the Rob D says in chat.

2575
02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:12,360
The OLR match game wouldn't end, and DMN was spamming in chat.

2576
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:18,360
Skye then said to DMN, you better stop that, you asspiper, or I'll blank.

2577
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:20,360
Maybe that'll be the next question.

2578
02:15:20,360 --> 02:15:21,360
Who knows, we'll see.

2579
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:28,360
Alright, if X-Link doesn't give me an answer in like 15 seconds, I am discounting his answer this round.

2580
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:30,360
And Rama will have to match by himself.

2581
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,360
So here we go.

2582
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:43,360
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.

2583
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,360
Oh, oh, oh!

2584
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:45,360
There it is.

2585
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,360
Happy New Year.

2586
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:47,360
There it is.

2587
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:48,360
Alright, finally.

2588
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:51,360
Rama, during an episode of OLR, there was a tie and they couldn't think of another one.

2589
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:54,360
So they decided to sell a tie by?

2590
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:57,360
A fight to the flaming death.

2591
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:00,360
A fight to the flaming death.

2592
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:10,360
And X-Link said, a fight.

2593
02:16:10,360 --> 02:16:15,360
However, however, I think we might have a way to break the tie.

2594
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,360
So, hold on.

2595
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:19,360
Alright, so Dark Sakura.

2596
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:22,360
They decided to settle the score by?

2597
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,360
A fight to the finish.

2598
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,360
A fight to the finish.

2599
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:28,360
Alright, so that's a point for each.

2600
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:30,360
Alright, Sauce.

2601
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:32,360
They decided to settle the score by?

2602
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:33,360
Sing Star ABBA Showdown.

2603
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:35,360
Sing Star ABBA Showdown!

2604
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:37,360
That's a fight to the death.

2605
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:38,360
That's a wonderful answer.

2606
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:40,360
Alright, Loki.

2607
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:43,360
They decided to settle the score by?

2608
02:16:43,360 --> 02:17:06,240
her you know I just give Loki the gift card honestly I don't know why that's so

2609
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:15,760
funny and I'm not even drunk all right well okay they decided to settle the

2610
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:27,120
score by oh I'm sorry drew side so score by two men enter one man leaves this is

2611
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,880
Thunderdome a fight to the finish all right so a point for each of them a

2612
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:38,220
fight another fight okay here's the thing though here's my answer they

2613
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:43,360
decided to settle the score by setting the studio on fire but please don't

2614
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:49,680
actually do this but I'm thinking Rama did say a fight to the flaming finish so

2615
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:58,080
it might match with Rama all right so you wanna we are we're still in a tie so

2616
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:03,440
what happens does neither one win one more question oh this segment is getting

2617
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:09,120
way too long read the one that the Rob D right we do Rob D's question all right

2618
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,360
this is it I swear to God if we don't have a winner here then I don't know

2619
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:14,360
we're just give it away next week or something I don't know what we're gonna

2620
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:28,040
do here it is or we'll flip a damn coin says Brad okay we are

2621
02:18:28,040 --> 02:18:32,320
back on orange lounge radio I I think we're still here we had a little bit of

2622
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:36,280
technical difficulty during the tiebreaker our very climatic tiebreaker

2623
02:18:36,280 --> 02:18:42,280
here on orange launch radio and our little table that houses the actual

2624
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:47,380
mixing board and had some various items sitting on it actually buckled like the

2625
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:51,880
damn thing just like all over if it fainted from the pressure of match game

2626
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:56,600
apparently and it knocked our sound board over and it ended up pulling out

2627
02:18:56,600 --> 02:19:01,680
all the core that were in it and all that stuff so that's why the suddenly

2628
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:05,920
the show went dead for those you guys that were listening live Frisbee says

2629
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:09,640
don't edit this out of the podcast this part won't be but probably the minutes

2630
02:19:09,640 --> 02:19:12,680
and minutes long of silence will need to be because people will think their iPods

2631
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:19,080
broke so there you go all right so who there you have it all right so we are

2632
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:24,240
gonna try one more time to resolve this whole match game thing going on right

2633
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:31,640
now oh yeah do we why we can't do the Rob D's question okay we'll do that all

2634
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:37,560

2651
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:43,200
form of violation but it doesn't matter because Rama wins by a point at least so

2666
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,800
game to take so long I apologize for that but you know what it was a slow

2667
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:11,680
news week so deal just deal okay deal Loki have some news haven't you ever

2668
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:15,320
thought to yourself when playing a game of pinball gee I wish I could learn

2669
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:20,880
about flatulence right now well now you can thanks to a custom pinball game

2670
02:23:20,880 --> 02:23:29,040
called gas attack that was part of a exhibit in gross ology apparently these

2671
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:35,760
two exhibits or this part of the exhibit your pinball is actually bacteria and

2672
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:42,400
you bump it into different foods that cause flatulence including meat onions

2673
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:51,520
you name it and yes cabbage is on there brussel or brussel sprouts cheese all

2674
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:58,280
sorts of stuff and they do have a picture of intestines right above it is

2675
02:23:58,280 --> 02:24:05,200
that the ramp no that's not the ramp the ramp there's actually a few clear ramps

2676
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:09,000
that are in there but it has like a toilet and a bunch of other stuff on

2677
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:12,720
there pretty basic looking but I get some message across I guess that is

2678
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:17,480
something else that's amazing you know where yeah frisbee asked the question I

2679
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:24,680
want to know where can I play this you know I'm not sure where this exhibits

2680
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:34,720
actually at but it's yeah some gross ology exhibit that's touring so I will

2681
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:40,440
find out gross ology that sounds pretty amazing all right I don't is this a

2682
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:43,080
pinball game that you want to play dark soccer I mean you do play lots of

2683
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:48,840
pinball games you want to play the fart game no I had to ask well I don't know

2684
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:53,600
if this game is gonna be any better or worse but oh sorry real quick yeah you

2685
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:57,960
can actually find out more about the gross ology tour by going to gross ology

2686
02:24:57,960 --> 02:25:02,800
tour calm and they have I think the dates that they'll be available well how

2687
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:08,760
convenient all right well hey if that game doesn't sound like your your idea

2688
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:13,320
of a good time maybe this one will be a little better it's push-up foo is a new

2689
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:17,900
game that has come out for the iPhone it's a part of a series called the foo

2690
02:25:17,900 --> 02:25:23,680
apps like Shaq foo but this is called the push-up foo and apparently what this

2691
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:28,680
is it uses the device's accelerometer to track how many push-ups you're doing and

2692
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:33,140
give you feedback on how you're doing with your push-ups so that's kind of

2693
02:25:33,140 --> 02:25:36,620
interesting I guess I don't know if you put the thing on your back or something

2694
02:25:36,620 --> 02:25:39,160
or where you put this when you're doing your push-ups but I guess it actually

2695
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:42,800
tracks how many push-ups you're doing and how well you've done but here's the

2696
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:47,800
other cool thing push-up foo also lets you join a tracked league or you can go

2697
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:52,220
head-to-head in what's called a battle mode apparently there's a course in it

2698
02:25:52,220 --> 02:25:57,460
that makes you it trains you to do a hundred and push-ups in it so that's

2699
02:25:57,460 --> 02:26:01,460
that's kind of an interesting use for the iPhone kind of like throwing a Wii

2700
02:26:01,460 --> 02:26:07,220
Fit angle into it or teaching you how to shake or tilt the iPhone into thinking

2701
02:26:07,220 --> 02:26:11,860
that you've done a hundred push-ups for real huh just like how you can shake the

2702
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:17,220
remote it makes you think that her makes Wii Fit think you're jogging but you

2703
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:20,500
know this might actually be kind of a fun competitive way like to do like if

2704
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:23,860
you and your friends are doing it for like actual push-ups this might be kind

2705
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:27,100
of a fun way to motivate people I don't know I hope they come out with other

2706
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:34,620
versions of it we'll see gs68 says you put it in your pants I always put it in

2707
02:26:34,620 --> 02:26:39,680
my pants all right anyhow I don't know I it looks interesting if it's free I'll

2708
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:46,660
check it out if it's not then I probably won't well I actually I I have this that

2709
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:53,820
I'm reporting on next you can get game and watch games on your iPhone and I've

2710
02:26:53,820 --> 02:27:03,540
downloaded two of them basically they they're done a little differently but

2711
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:09,220
they still really are the game and watch games you've got parachute chef fire and

2712
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:17,140
octopus but they're called gw parachute gw chef gw fire gw octopus they're

2713
02:27:17,140 --> 02:27:25,500
dollar-99 and then wait till Nintendo hears about it yeah hurry before a

2714
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:30,540
cease-and-desist gets sent it's pretty fun which will probably fire you better

2715
02:27:30,540 --> 02:27:36,460
get him now there you go you know I saw something on one of those gaming blogs I

2716
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:42,500
was talking about an app that wasn't accepted into my apples app store there

2717
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:48,420
apparently it was a booby shaking game that you can shake your iPhone in the

2718
02:27:48,420 --> 02:27:54,220
boob shake awesome and this wasn't accepted why because apparently it's

2719
02:27:54,220 --> 02:28:03,380
inappropriate for people I don't know whatever yeah whatever there is a new

2720
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:08,820
exploit that's been found in the PSP you may remember before that they were doing

2721
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:14,300
buffer overflows with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and I think before

2722
02:28:14,300 --> 02:28:19,860
that I can't remember whether games they were using to do that but now the newest

2723
02:28:19,860 --> 02:28:25,020
game to be able to do this is actually a very old game grip shift apparently

2724
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:29,340
someone found an exploit in it where you can also do a similar buffer overflow

2725
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:36,180
and it allows you to load modified save games which you can run all sorts of

2726
02:28:36,180 --> 02:28:40,460
homebrew programs but the most important thing about this is it works on the PSP

2727
02:28:40,460 --> 02:28:47,880
3000 and will eventually lead to custom firmwares on the PSP 3000 so try as you

2728
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:56,500
may Sony it will never ever ever ever work so in other words they just need to

2729
02:28:56,500 --> 02:29:00,020
give up on patching it out they should just give up but hey you know they want

2730
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:04,180
they don't think they kind of owe it to the people that you know and make games

2731
02:29:04,180 --> 02:29:09,740
for their system to yeah I guess whatever will never ever work well hey

2732
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:14,220

2744
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:12,980
right after the table collapsed that would have been a good time to do it

2745
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:21,300
all right all right let's get to the F use of the week then since I when I

2746
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:26,380
forget to put in the F use in the show role I get pretty pissed off at myself

2747
02:30:26,380 --> 02:30:49,940
if you goes to be woken up from a deep sleep this morning to be bitched up

2748
02:30:49,940 --> 02:31:02,500
and the damn table sauce I'll try to keep it short but Ron Charles sent me a

2749
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:07,220
Christmas card for Christmas obviously and when I received it the envelope had

2750
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:12,460
been completely opened on three sides by someone else who obviously thought that

2751
02:31:12,460 --> 02:31:19,660
maybe there was games and prizes inside of some sort that F you to that person

2752
02:31:19,660 --> 02:31:24,940
who opened it and F you to my mailman who delivered it to the wrong place

2753
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:31,620

02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:45,740
more airsoft guns instead I did something responsible and actually put

2757
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:49,020
it into a savings account but it's still pissing me off because I have the urge

2758
02:31:49,020 --> 02:32:00,580
to spend it on useless shit through F you to the card table F you to UPS being

wait we have EA is branching out into a new field of video games for them at

2774

2782
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:11,860
can get that's right the ongoing saga of the stolen PlayStation 3 so unfortunately

2783
02:34:11,860 --> 02:34:19,180
it sounds like it was never found so but you got a replacement yeah and now I

2784
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:26,060
just basically checked out home for the first time you know since I replaced my

2785
02:34:26,060 --> 02:34:30,780
PlayStation 3 and I I don't know you know I didn't know anything about but

2786
02:34:30,780 --> 02:34:35,820
you know what wasn't her supposed to be something in home there basically

2787
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:41,580
allowed you to go into your like your pocket or whatever bring your friends

2788
02:34:41,580 --> 02:34:46,100
and be able to stream your music or videos and photos and stuff like that

2789
02:34:46,100 --> 02:34:49,900
yeah that was in the early beta but unfortunately it does not look like that

2790
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:53,660
function has hit the finished product much like half of the other things that

2791
02:34:53,660 --> 02:34:56,540
Sony said was going to be in there such as the trophy cases you're gonna have

2792
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:59,940
for all the trophies that you get in the games and you know a couple other things

2793
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:03,700
I think they were probably a little worried as they should be about people

2794
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:09,620
putting copyright content all over their house but I'll tell you that's the one

2795
02:35:09,620 --> 02:35:13,060
thing that's helping me from getting an OLR clubhouse I would put down the money

2796
02:35:13,060 --> 02:35:17,420
for an OLR clubhouse like that if I could somehow put in like any time like

2797
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:21,260
even if I could just put like our podcast album art on the wall or

2798
02:35:21,260 --> 02:35:26,300
something cheesy like that I would do it like but I don't I think what they offer

2799
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:33,460
right now is kind of dopey yeah in a way I can see what they're kind of

2800
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:39,380
saying is not just for copyright stuff but you know how you know the media and

2801
02:35:39,380 --> 02:35:45,740
sharing other people whose names I won't mention like to get up and up all up in

2802
02:35:45,740 --> 02:35:51,260
arms about you know stupid things you know things now if they had you know

2803
02:35:51,260 --> 02:35:55,940
put the stringing stuff you know functionality to home you know someone

2804
02:35:55,940 --> 02:36:01,340
would've been stupid enough to like stream porn or whatever and then now

2805
02:36:01,340 --> 02:36:06,340
someone will kill see it and all of a sudden you know we'll be fucking off you

2806
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:13,100
know get into the fire you know give those people ammo to sure us with enough

2807
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:16,460
well I mean if somebody's gonna do something inappropriate they should just

2808
02:36:16,460 --> 02:36:19,180
simply be banned there should be a really really easy way to report and

2809
02:36:19,180 --> 02:36:22,620
ban those people you know that oh there already should be something set up

2810
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:25,460
because there's already some craziness going on in home but I'll tell you my

2811
02:36:25,460 --> 02:36:28,460
favorite thing I've discovered to do in home I like to go in the movie theater

2812
02:36:28,460 --> 02:36:31,260
where the previews are playing especially when there's like one preview

2813
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:34,900
playing over and over and over again and I like to go stand right in the middle

2814
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:40,460
of the screen and dance that's my favorite yeah yeah I've seen people do

2815
02:36:40,460 --> 02:36:44,780
that already yeah it might have been me actually it was a guy wearing a green

2816
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:47,700
shirt and jeans it was probably me because actually I turned it on on New

2817
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:50,620
Year's Eve to show some friends what was all about and they wanted me to just

2818
02:36:50,620 --> 02:36:54,980
walk up to random people and start dancing in front of them so I don't know

2819
02:36:54,980 --> 02:36:57,660
all right anyway hey spazzing here we gotta let you go to get some more calls

2823
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:13,460

2824

2825
02:37:17,740 --> 02:37:25,560
seven game olr another last-minute story Loki yes actually apparently GameStop is

2826
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:31,580
no longer accepting Xbox game systems or accessories in trade effective February

2827
02:37:31,580 --> 02:37:37,140
9th even though more people are playing them than ps3 yes if you're playing them

2828
02:37:37,140 --> 02:37:40,980
you're certainly not playing them from GameStop now so hurry up and get them in

2829
02:37:40,980 --> 02:37:49,260
yes all right and then also Wii Sports is now the best-selling game of all time

it's even exceeded a Super Mario Brothers amazing hi you're on orange

2831
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:59,420
launch radio who's this it's obviously you know who let's just talk to you

2832
02:37:59,420 --> 02:38:03,620
what's up no nothing much just celebrating you're just bringing in the

2833
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:09,580
new year with mediocrity and just pull just a boring weekend generally yeah how

2834
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:15,780
did you how did you celebrate what types of games did you play oh for New Year's

2835
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:21,620
oh that's simple drunken Left 4 Dead after the ball drops nice oh that's one

2836
02:38:21,620 --> 02:38:26,020
of those things like I still or leading up to it but yeah definitely you know

2837
02:38:26,020 --> 02:38:31,420
playing Left 4 Dead in the dark with a with other people while like really

2838
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:36,420
hammered up I'm worried that game will actually make me shit my pants that's

2839
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:40,220
what I'm worried about that game it was it's nothing compared to like the other

2840
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:44,380
classical movies like Dawn of the Dead although I'll be cool they had like a

2841
02:38:44,380 --> 02:38:49,740
mall map for Left 4 Dead either that authentic feeling but besides that it's

2842
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:53,540
been that's the only excitement I had last week everything else afterwards has

2843
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:58,660
just been you know ho hum yeah yeah money's tight so I don't have money to

2844
02:38:58,660 --> 02:39:02,300
go out I have might as well stay at home what are you looking forward to what are

2845
02:39:02,300 --> 02:39:09,260
you looking forward to most in 2009 uh well let me see besides digital life

2846
02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:15,060
hopefully coming back other other things you know III being open to the public

2847
02:39:15,060 --> 02:39:19,900
and all hopefully other companies not and not getting the ham not getting the

2848
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:26,660
axe and generally just damn good games coming out I hope so I hope Sony could

2849
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:33,020
definitely make it the year of the ps3 unlike the critics who's already already

2850
02:39:33,020 --> 02:39:37,580
said that you know I've already said that sort of thing last year and the

2851
02:39:37,580 --> 02:39:41,300
year before that and they were wrong it's gonna take something big but who

2852
02:39:41,300 --> 02:39:46,780
knows III could be could be this could be this is gonna be a big big year for

2853
02:39:46,780 --> 02:39:51,020
III with you I mean I'm going back in the public special though no I mean yeah

2854
02:39:51,020 --> 02:39:55,160
it's going back to the the circus you can expect that that is gonna be one

2855
02:39:55,160 --> 02:40:00,200
huge thing in 2009 III 2009 is gonna be bigger than any III in the past five

2856
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:06,140
years okay either play as I you know as a boon for the ESA or it could be

2857
02:40:06,140 --> 02:40:09,860
another big clusterfuck like like the e3s of years past where you had like

2858
02:40:09,860 --> 02:40:14,900
booth babes just a lot of like you know a lot of game devs basically crunching

2859
02:40:14,900 --> 02:40:18,620
for that single demo that they're gonna end they're gonna showcase on e3 so it's

2860
02:40:18,620 --> 02:40:24,860
I don't know whether whether that's what the the effort to actually go back now

2861
02:40:24,860 --> 02:40:29,020
game guru in chat says III will bomb and no one will care we'll see I don't know

2862
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:33,940
I disagree that's one I mean that's one opinion okay I guess if that person's

2863
02:40:33,940 --> 02:40:37,500
trying to be realistic given the state of the economy unless for some reason

2864
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:41,700
the economy rebounds over the summer then you'll see a massive circus like

2865
02:40:41,700 --> 02:40:45,460
the like the old ones yeah I think hopefully heck of a circus you'll still

2866
02:40:45,460 --> 02:40:52,340
be alive not like the ones only the last year and the 2007 with just like bombs

2867
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:57,980
literally ho-hum and just like boring as hell I didn't do nothing to keep it like

2868
02:40:57,980 --> 02:41:03,100
a rigid you know originally as a business expo whereas the old ones

2869
02:41:03,100 --> 02:41:08,540
pretty much you know brought back the hype at the height right there and the

2870
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:13,780
height you know ended up selling the games well we will we will see what

2871
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:17,460
develops I don't know why that I'm sorry I'm being distracted by chat room where

2872
02:41:17,460 --> 02:41:22,660
a picture of me pretending to kiss DMN at PAX was posted in chat I don't know

2873
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:26,140
why that why that happened why did that have to happen I don't know all right

2897
02:43:40,940 --> 02:43:43,740
match game you're knocking soundboards out the table yeah it's been a pretty

2898
02:43:43,740 --> 02:43:48,500
epic night um what's on your mind hey we had we had we have to ring in 2009 the

2899
02:43:48,500 --> 02:43:53,380
only way we know how exactly not too much well I I hear you didn't like HD

2900
02:43:53,380 --> 02:43:56,780
remix and I know that I'm a little bit late on the draw because you talked

2901
02:43:56,780 --> 02:44:01,700
about issues a couple weeks ago and uh I gotta say I'm pretty much in love with

2902
02:44:01,700 --> 02:44:04,780
the game so I was just calling it a disagree with you a little bit on that

2903
02:44:04,780 --> 02:44:10,180
try to contrast in view you know I just didn't find that there was I don't know

2904
02:44:10,180 --> 02:44:13,180
like Street Fighter 2 is one of those things I find that is better left in my

2905
02:44:13,180 --> 02:44:17,060
memory you know what I mean like it's just not something I think this is and

2906
02:44:17,060 --> 02:44:19,900
I've had time to reflect on what the hell is my big problem with is the game

2907
02:44:19,900 --> 02:44:23,540
anyway and I think honestly what it boils down to is that a lot of my

2908
02:44:23,540 --> 02:44:28,220
problem with the game has boiled down to the shift to Xbox Live and PlayStation

2909
02:44:28,220 --> 02:44:31,700
Network for these games and that it just doesn't have the same magic as it does

2910
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:35,420
when you actually walk into an arcade and you get to shit talk someone like

2911
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:40,440
right there in the you know that that's actually standing there next to you

2912
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:44,180
because people say things online that they would not say to your face that's

2913
02:44:44,180 --> 02:44:48,260
one thing that I'm so I'm quickly learning about Xbox Live as for the game

2914
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:52,460
itself I I hated the soundtrack that was my like number one bitch about the I know

2915
02:44:52,460 --> 02:44:55,860
I did I and I know they were trying to do the right thing by doing the fan

2916
02:44:55,860 --> 02:44:59,240
remixes and everything and don't even wrong I appreciate the gesture but the

2917
02:44:59,240 --> 02:45:03,140
soundtrack was hideous in my opinion. Oh the remix soundtrack not the original

2918
02:45:03,140 --> 02:45:06,540
soundtrack or do you just hate both? No I love the original. I do love the original

2919
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:10,460
soundtrack. I don't like the remix one at all I don't like the remix one at all and

2920
02:45:10,460 --> 02:45:15,220
then I don't know that it just it just left me wanting more I felt like instead

2921
02:45:15,220 --> 02:45:18,500
of just kind of replacing the sprites it was going to be smoother but then I

2922
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:24,140
realized I'm thinking of Street Fighter 4. I am desperately looking forward to

2923
02:45:24,140 --> 02:45:26,820
Street Fighter 4 as well I mean it's actually coming out on my birthday which

2924
02:45:26,820 --> 02:45:32,100
is kind of odd. Oh nice. Yeah I the thing is is that I like what Capcom did I do I

2925
02:45:32,100 --> 02:45:34,780
think it's great that they actually did go to the fans for the remixes which I

2926
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:37,340
can understand why they'd be a little bit subjective especially if you liked

2927
02:45:37,340 --> 02:45:41,820
you know the the sound of the original songs and all. I did I really did like

2928
02:45:41,820 --> 02:45:46,660
the originals. It's great that Capcom actually did go to the guys at GGPO and

2929
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:50,460
actually got their help with the netcode I mean the multiplayer for Street Fighter

2930
02:45:50,460 --> 02:45:54,460
2 is I don't want to call it flawless because there are a couple problems I

2931
02:45:54,460 --> 02:45:58,220
mean even then lag does pop up occasionally but I never thought they'd

2932
02:45:58,220 --> 02:46:02,780
actually be able to get a fighting game this good online and just actually seeing

2933
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:06,060
this actually being able to play you know totient up in Canada or being able

2934
02:46:06,060 --> 02:46:11,820
to play even Shadow's Wire across in the UK with no lag or very negligible lag is

2935
02:46:11,820 --> 02:46:16,460
it blows my mind frankly. It's like I'm literally playing them in the arcade

2936
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:20,620
right uh right next to them as far as the lag goes. Maybe I need to play

2937
02:46:20,620 --> 02:46:25,140
against more like real people I know and not random people because I played this

2938
02:46:25,140 --> 02:46:27,020
all at a friend's house because I actually don't even own the game I

2939
02:46:27,020 --> 02:46:31,700
actually played on PlayStation 3 so but yeah it's just I don't know and oh god

2940
02:46:31,700 --> 02:46:36,340
the Xbox 360 controller still is such an issue like I feel like if I did get the

2941
02:46:36,340 --> 02:46:39,260
game I'd have to get it on PlayStation 3 and even then I don't I don't know a lot

2942
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:44,420
of people on there. Yeah I've been enjoying actually playing a few people

2943
02:46:44,420 --> 02:46:47,700
from the all-games community in the OLR community over an HD remix so that

2944
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:51,300
hasn't been so much of a problem for me. It's been a learning curve to actually

2945
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:55,900
get used to the controller the d-pad is leaving calluses on my thumbs frankly

2946
02:46:55,900 --> 02:46:58,740
and I've had to use the control stick for anyone who's not a Shotokan

2947
02:46:58,740 --> 02:47:03,220
character. Do we have a lot of OLR people that play Left 4 Dead on PC? I know

2948
02:47:03,220 --> 02:47:05,740
this is a completely random topic but I'm kind of curious because I'm actually

2949
02:47:05,740 --> 02:47:09,900
thinking about getting Left 4 Dead but on PC not uh not 360 just because I

2950
02:47:09,900 --> 02:47:13,660
first-person shooters I think I could do better on PC than I can on the 360. I

2951
02:47:13,660 --> 02:47:17,540
just want to throw that out there. What you can do is join the Steam community

2952
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:20,780
Orange Launch Radio does have a Steam community. Is there actually people that

2953
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:25,020
are still using it? Yeah I'm on it. Interesting all right maybe I'll have to

2954
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:27,100
play Left 4 Dead sometime because I think I'm gonna pick that up sooner

2955
02:47:27,100 --> 02:47:31,140
than later. So anyway sorry didn't mean to didn't mean to just rail what Rob D

2956
02:47:31,140 --> 02:47:34,460
had originally called in about. Yeah you know I noticed the fighting game fans

2957
02:47:34,460 --> 02:47:37,660
especially really are in love with HD remakes and maybe I didn't give it a

2958
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:41,440
fair look but I don't know it just didn't it didn't it didn't resonate the

2959
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:44,980
way with me that it did the rest of you. I guess maybe my I was just so hyped up

2960
02:47:44,980 --> 02:47:48,460
for it to be this like new and something like so different but it was just kind

2961
02:47:48,460 --> 02:47:52,580
of like I don't know like it just felt like a letdown to me I it's hard to

2962
02:47:52,580 --> 02:47:55,460
explain. I'm looking forward to Street Fighter 4 as well and if they actually

2963
02:47:55,460 --> 02:47:58,140
get the netcode half as good on that game as they did in Street Fighter HD

2964
02:47:58,140 --> 02:48:01,380
remakes I'll be happy so. I will say that I'm definitely looking forward to Street

2965
02:48:01,380 --> 02:48:04,340
Fighter 4 as well I will definitely pick that up when it comes out so we will

2966
02:48:04,340 --> 02:48:07,340
have that to battle on if nothing else. And nothing will match the magic of

2967
02:48:07,340 --> 02:48:11,300
actually playing someone in an arcade right next to them you know the

2968
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:14,980
shadiness of the arcade aside because let's face it not some some arcades

2969
02:48:14,980 --> 02:48:20,220
are better left to our memories rather than to our current sense of

2970
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:25,300
smell today. Yeah good point good point. All right well Rob D I gotta let you

2971
02:48:25,300 --> 02:48:28,660
go so we wrap up the show but thank you so much for your call and have fun

2972
02:48:28,660 --> 02:48:32,500
battling the fellow listeners online. That's great to do. Act after you're going

2973
02:48:32,500 --> 02:48:36,860
down. See you later. Later. I guess they're already setting up a battle after the

2974
02:48:36,860 --> 02:48:39,520
show. That's one of the great things about doing a radio show like Orange

2975
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:43,220
Lounge Radio. So you know we are moving into 2009 which if you can believe it

2976
02:48:43,220 --> 02:48:48,540
we started this show in 2002 so now this is our seventh year of broadcasting if

2977
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:53,140
you can believe it and it's really neat to see the community that's kind of

2978
02:48:53,140 --> 02:48:56,380
built up and that people kind of do this stuff that makes it what we do here like

2979
02:48:56,380 --> 02:49:02,940
so worthwhile. Car tables being knocked over and all. Speaking of which yes got a

2980
02:49:02,940 --> 02:49:06,460
message from Rama with all the people who chipped in on that whiteboard for

2981
02:49:06,460 --> 02:49:11,260
you guys. Yes I I was seeing some stuff in chat what is going on I thought that

2982
02:49:11,260 --> 02:49:15,420
this was just something Rama got from his connections or something that is

2983
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:21,900
work. We pooled our money together. Shut up. Me, Rama, Misty, SSJ 100 Matt, and Alpha

2984
02:49:21,900 --> 02:49:26,300
Kinanagram all pitched in to get you the whiteboard. That is so awesome. Well

2985
02:49:26,300 --> 02:49:30,780
thank you guys so much for that. That is great. I hope you get some use out of it.

2986
02:49:30,780 --> 02:49:33,700
We will. Well I'm probably gonna do I'm probably gonna rearrange this. We're

2987
02:49:33,700 --> 02:49:37,540
gonna have a week down. I'm gonna be on vacation so not only am I going you know

2988
02:49:37,540 --> 02:49:41,340
off out of the state for a few days but I'm gonna be just taking a couple extra

2989
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:44,340
days off work. I'm probably gonna try and rearrange some things in here so probably

2990
02:49:44,340 --> 02:49:47,140
what I'm gonna do instead of hanging the whiteboard up I'll probably move all

2991
02:49:47,140 --> 02:49:50,020
these stuffed animals you see back here and have the whiteboard resting there

2992
02:49:50,020 --> 02:49:53,900
and move some things around so that way it's easily accessible too and that the

2993
02:49:53,900 --> 02:49:57,100
whiteboard won't get knocked over if I do try to mount it so but we will

2994
02:49:57,100 --> 02:49:59,420
definitely make use out of it and that'll be something fun for the Justin

2995
02:49:59,420 --> 02:50:03,120
TV listeners because hopefully we will have a webcam when we come back in two

2996
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:06,900
weeks here on this show so it's almost like a whole new show not really though

2997
02:50:06,900 --> 02:50:11,980
just some new toys some new toys for an old and aging and practically dead show

2998
02:50:11,980 --> 02:50:18,380
hey like Benny Hill right we're old and dead all right all right so hopefully

2999
02:50:18,380 --> 02:50:23,740
far from decrepit trust me JTV I will stop at nothing to get JTV back next
