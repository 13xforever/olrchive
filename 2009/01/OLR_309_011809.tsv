7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Molok.
14000	16000	Tonight, January 18, 2009.
16000	20000	Could we see the DSI released in April for the U.S.?
20000	21000	Circuit City goes under.
21000	27000	And are the.hack games set to make a comeback?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	44000	We are back after a little bit of a break.
44000	50000	Took a little break last week because I was in Hawaii taking a little vacation.
50000	54000	But I'm back now and refreshed and feeling better.
54000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts. I'll be joining you for the next several hours.
56000	61000	Not joining us tonight, sadly, the happiest bunny on the farm, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61000	64000	She has the night off. It's her last week before going back to school.
64000	66000	So she's taking care of some things around the house.
66000	68000	But we have somebody filling in tonight.
68000	72000	I called the other woman that I know. The other female gamer I know.
72000	74000	So say hello to Rice Princess.
74000	75000	I'm your mistress.
75000	77000	That's right. How you doing, Rice Princess?
77000	79000	Oh, I'm okay. How about yourself?
79000	80000	I'm doing great.
80000	81000	It's good to hear.
81000	84000	I see you're wearing a Silent Hill t-shirt showing your love for Pyramid Head.
84000	87000	Yeah, because I thought the camera was going to be working tonight.
87000	89000	And I did my hair and everything.
89000	91000	Well, here's the funny thing. I know you look very cute, by the way.
91000	92000	Thanks.
92000	94000	I could take a picture and post it to the website or something.
94000	95000	All in vain.
95000	97000	I know. Well, I get to see you and that's important.
97000	100000	Yeah, because you're not gay at all.
100000	106000	Okay. Here's the thing is that I was going to say you and Jamie both have Silent Hill shirts that you wear to the show.
106000	109000	So we need to get you both here sometime and you can be twinsies.
109000	111000	Are they the same shirt?
111000	112000	No.
112000	113000	Oh, okay.
113000	114000	It's a slightly different one.
114000	116000	Mine's thermal so it keeps me warm.
116000	118000	I see. That's good because we have like a cold garage.
118000	119000	Kind of, yeah.
119000	120000	A little bit.
120000	121000	So I'm going to survive tonight.
121000	123000	All right. Well, I'm going to get the heater on in just a minute.
123000	125000	But thank you also for bringing Snickerdoodles to the show.
125000	126000	You're welcome.
126000	128000	Because you know bribing us with food always freaking rocks.
128000	129000	Yep. Always.
129000	130000	All right.
130000	133000	Say hello as well to the one and only tech master, Loki, who's joining us tonight.
133000	134000	Hello.
134000	135000	How are you doing, Loki?
135000	136000	Doing fine.
136000	138000	Great. How was your week off? What did you end up doing?
138000	141000	Trying to get Grand Theft Auto PC to work.
141000	142000	Yeah?
142000	143000	It's taken a turn for the worst.
143000	146000	It's like, I don't know.
146000	148000	It was doing so well.
148000	149000	It was working just fine.
149000	153000	And all of a sudden, Rockstar's like, ah, fuck this shit.
153000	155000	We're not going to work no matter what you do now.
155000	159000	I've reinstalled it like eight times now.
159000	164000	And I've uninstalled the other things that remotely might be related to it.
164000	166000	And it just does not want to work.
166000	168000	And apparently I'm not alone.
168000	169000	And yeah.
169000	174000	Well, I'm sorry to hear that Grand Theft Auto has not been cooperating with you.
174000	177000	Are you looking forward to just hacking the game to your heart's content?
177000	178000	Well, that's what I was doing.
178000	179000	And then it caused the crash.
179000	183000	And then I had to reload it or something because it wasn't working correctly.
183000	186000	And then it just hasn't worked correctly since.
186000	190000	And there's no reason that it shouldn't be because I just still know.
190000	192000	So I give up.
192000	194000	I actually bought this game.
194000	197000	And see, that teaches me for not pirating this shit.
197000	199000	See what happens?
199000	201000	If I buy it, it breaks.
201000	202000	And it sucks.
202000	205000	If I had just downloaded it like I should have, wouldn't have this problem.
205000	207000	Let that be a lesson to you all.
207000	209000	Seriously.
209000	212000	Okay.
212000	213000	Well, all right.
213000	217000	Well, hey, you I had tuned in because also last week we missed our buddy Bobby.
217000	221000	Bobby Black Wolf does a show before us here on All Games Radio.
221000	224000	And he does the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sundays.
224000	226000	But he just launched a new Friday night show, right?
226000	228000	Friday night gaming.
228000	230000	And you tried to play Grand Theft Auto on the first show, right?
230000	231000	Oh, yeah.
231000	232000	Oh, yeah, that was even more fun.
232000	233000	Let's see.
233000	235000	Yeah, for some reason then Xbox Live said,
235000	240000	No, you're never going to connect to this game ever if you even want to.
240000	242000	I tried four different times.
242000	244000	I even reset my system a few different times.
244000	246000	And it just said, No, I'm sorry.
246000	249000	You just cannot connect to this game ever.
249000	253000	So fuck Grand Theft Auto.
253000	254000	All right.
254000	257000	And you know, still been playing lots of Grand Theft Auto IV.
257000	258000	All right, there you have it.
258000	262000	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto IV, I have to bring this up.
262000	263000	This is pretty awesome.
263000	264000	I got to rub this in.
264000	270000	While I was in Hawaii, I got Grand Theft Auto IV for 30 bucks on the Xbox 360.
270000	274000	And I got Metal Gear Solid IV for $20 for the PlayStation 3.
274000	275000	Both new and wrapped.
275000	278000	It's like getting them for $5 in Hawaii.
278000	279000	Kind of.
279000	280000	Really cheap.
280000	281000	Kind of.
281000	284000	Radio Shack, apparently, I had forgotten that they got into the market of selling games.
284000	287000	But then like when I saw that they were clearing them out,
287000	289000	because I guess I hadn't been performing very well,
289000	292000	I suddenly remembered, Oh yeah, I think we reported that on the show once,
292000	294000	is that Radio Shack was selling games.
294000	296000	And not anymore.
296000	301000	You know, actually I was going to say that Best Buy was clearing out some games as well.
301000	305000	They had Ninja Gaiden 2 for 10 bucks.
305000	307000	For the 360.
307000	308000	Nice.
308000	310000	I wouldn't buy it because I don't have a 360.
310000	312000	You should get one one of these days.
312000	313000	You really should.
313000	315000	Are you still on your anti-Microsoft thing?
315000	317000	I thought you finally caved and you were going to get one.
317000	319000	I'm not anti-Microsoft.
319000	322000	I'm just anti-Xbox because it's a piece of crap system.
322000	324000	Geez.
324000	325000	You guys missed it.
325000	328000	Bryce Princess and Loki were getting into it before the show about Nintendo.
328000	330000	Maybe we'll talk about it later.
330000	332000	Yeah, well why don't you just tell them what you said
332000	336000	and I won't even need to do anything because, you know.
336000	339000	It was so asinine that, you know.
339000	340000	We'll get to it later.
340000	343000	I've got to introduce someone else because she's been sitting there very quiet and patiently
343000	345000	which is so unlike her.
345000	346000	Fuck you.
346000	348000	Is that going to be your first words on the show?
348000	349000	Yes, it is going to be your first words on the show.
349000	350000	Fuck you.
350000	353000	Alright, she has never been on the show before.
353000	355000	But this is Miss Victoria, everybody.
355000	356000	Hi guys.
356000	357000	How are you, Miss Victoria?
357000	358000	What?
358000	359000	How are you, Miss Victoria?
359000	360000	I'm fabulous as always.
360000	363000	That's why I decided to call you on the show, Miss Victoria.
363000	365000	Okay, you can call me Miss Victoria.
365000	368000	See, what I'm doing is I'm advertising that you're single and unmarried.
368000	370000	Yes, I'm single and unmarried.
370000	377000	So, I'm looking, the chat room is going crazy right now for two reasons.
377000	381000	The earlier, and of course you can always join us in chat, chat.orangelaunchradio.com
381000	382000	if you want to join us in chat.
382000	384000	The chat's not working on the laptop, so we can't see it.
384000	386000	Alright, we'll get it working somehow later on.
386000	388000	But, Loki and I can see it.
388000	389000	They're there.
389000	390000	They're freaking out.
390000	391000	They want pics of Rice Princess.
391000	394000	So, I'll try to get something on the Twitter because, you know, OMG woman.
394000	398000	So, I'll try to get, I'll get Rice Princess and Victoria to pose
398000	401000	and maybe I'll get them to make out a little bit.
401000	405000	I still have that one jello shot in the refrigerator from New Years.
405000	411000	Alright, and also they're freaking out because right now in chat,
411000	416000	a brand new Orange Lounge, I don't even know the name of my show,
416000	420000	a brand new Orange Lounge radio website is being previewed.
420000	425000	It's been made by our buddy Dekeman and he's posted the preview link there in chat
425000	426000	and it's amazing.
426000	430000	Like, I am so excited that finally our website that looks old
430000	432000	is going to be going away and looking new.
432000	434000	I am so freaking excited.
434000	437000	Do you know why that's why I love our listeners?
437000	440000	Because, it's like, which one is giving them the bigger boner?
440000	444000	Like, women on the show or the new website layout?
444000	447000	Like, that's awesome.
447000	448000	Alright, alright, back to Victoria.
448000	449000	She's never been on the show before.
449000	451000	We have to interview Victoria a little bit.
451000	452000	More about me.
452000	453000	It's all about you, isn't it?
453000	454000	Duh.
454000	457000	Alright, so what kinds of video games do you like?
457000	458000	What kinds of video games do you play?
458000	459000	Do you play a lot of games?
459000	460000	It's okay if you don't.
460000	461000	I don't, unfortunately.
461000	463000	I play Rock Band when I come over to your house
463000	466000	and the only video, well, we have a PlayStation 2 at my house
466000	468000	and my roommate plays Kingdom Hearts,
468000	471000	but the only thing I play is on my GameCube
471000	473000	and I play Mario Party 7 because that's the only game I have
473000	475000	because I stole it from my brother.
475000	477000	Okay, so she knows a little bit about her game.
477000	478000	She knows what she's talking about.
478000	479000	Yeah.
479000	480000	So she's got some stuff that she plays.
480000	481000	Kind of.
481000	482000	But yet you wear a shirt that says,
482000	484000	right now you're wearing a shirt on it that says nerd.
484000	485000	Yes.
485000	486000	So you do call yourself a nerd.
486000	488000	What makes you a nerd if you're not much of a gamer?
488000	491000	I'm a role player, an online role player.
491000	492000	Get out.
492000	493000	No, fuck you.
493000	494000	Get the fuck off this show.
494000	495000	Hey, I have talent, okay?
495000	496000	Don't be jealous.
496000	498000	You just sit in front of a computer and push buttons.
498000	500000	I actually write, bitch.
500000	501000	Alright.
501000	502000	What is it that you write, bitch?
502000	504000	Well, I'm a Harry Potter role player.
504000	506000	I'm a big Harry Potter nerd.
506000	508000	I admit it.
508000	509000	I'm proud of it.
509000	510000	I'm proud of it.
510000	511000	Okay.
511000	513000	Rob, you need to shut the fuck up,
513000	516000	because you used to be the vice president of the Star Trek club.
516000	517000	And what?
517000	518000	Yeah.
518000	519000	Like 15 years ago.
519000	523000	I know he has such a boner when the movie is going to come out.
523000	525000	He's going to drag my ass to the midnight premiere.
525000	526000	I can already tell you.
526000	531000	So what exactly do you mean by cos, or like role playing?
531000	537000	Basically, I take on one of the roles of one of the characters in Harry Potter,
537000	539000	and somebody else takes another role, or they make up their own,
539000	541000	and we just plot.
541000	544000	I'm not like, no, no, no, no, no.
544000	546000	No, no, no, no.
546000	547000	Yeah.
547000	549000	Basically, that's it.
549000	551000	And we just plot and make our own little storyline.
551000	553000	It's glorified fan fiction, basically.
553000	554000	Okay.
554000	555000	Alright.
555000	556000	So you do other nerdy stuff, too, though.
556000	558000	Like, I know you watch Lost religiously.
558000	559000	All the time.
559000	560000	Oh my god, Wednesday.
560000	562000	I'm so excited.
562000	566000	And the thing I love about Victoria is she's so animated.
566000	570000	This is great.
570000	573000	I've got to read some comments from Chat about the whole role play thing.
573000	575000	Chat.orangelandsradio.com.
575000	578000	We have GS68 says, she puts on a robe and wizard hat.
578000	580000	Fuck you.
580000	582000	I do not.
582000	583000	I do not.
583000	584000	Alright.
584000	587000	That's only for the premieres.
587000	589000	Are you going to dress up for the next premiere?
589000	590000	I might.
590000	593000	If it comes down to it, I'll just buy a t-shirt and wear my Harry Potter jacket.
593000	594000	Okay.
594000	595000	That's alright.
595000	596000	That's alright.
596000	597000	There's nothing wrong with that.
597000	598000	Really?
598000	600000	What else was I going to say about you being a nerd?
600000	601000	Oh, you went to Comic Con last year.
601000	602000	I go to Comic Con every year.
602000	604000	I'm from San Diego.
604000	606000	So I go to Comic Con every year.
606000	607000	I love it.
607000	609000	It's going to be huge this year.
609000	611000	I can already tell you it's the 40th anniversary.
611000	615000	I haven't bought my tickets yet, but, you know, I should do that soon.
615000	618000	So what is it you like to see when you're at Comic Con?
618000	623000	Before the movie premieres and stuff like that, like last year I went, I saw the panel
623000	628000	for The Day the Earth Stood Still, and I saw, I unfortunately went to the Twilight panel,
628000	633000	unfortunately, and wanted to kill myself because all the little screaming 12-year-olds were,
633000	637000	you know, creaming their panties over Robert What's-his-face.
637000	638000	And, yeah.
638000	639000	So, I mean, I go for that.
639000	640000	Yeah, the movie premiere.
640000	646000	I've met so many celebrities because of Comic Con and, you know, met Matthew Fox, who I
646000	648000	kind of creamed my panties over.
648000	650000	Well, all right then.
650000	656000	I was thinking that roleplay is Matthew Fox.
656000	662000	Suddenly the chatters are lining up to roleplay Matthew Fox in your next Harry Potter thing.
662000	664000	That's amazing.
664000	669000	Okay, we've got to take this back to video games at some point, but my buddy Shane, an
669000	672000	old friend of the show, Miklotov, is listening, and he's sending me private messages.
672000	675000	Tell Irene and Victoria hi, and they need to make out.
675000	678000	Hi, Shane!
678000	680000	All right, we'll have to get the liquor out.
680000	682000	Maybe that'll happen later.
682000	683000	All right.
683000	686000	Anyhow, let's actually get back to some gaming here real quick.
686000	687000	Oh, wait.
687000	689000	I do want to ask you one other question, though, speaking of video games.
689000	690000	I can't take it back to gaming.
690000	696000	I love World of Warcraft, as you know, and Rice Princess also dabbles in World of Warcraft
696000	697000	once in a while.
697000	698000	Really funny story.
698000	702000	She played her boyfriend's account last night and out-DPS'd another character because she
702000	703000	didn't even know what she was doing.
703000	706000	But anyway, you are what we call a WoW Widow.
706000	708000	I was a WoW Widow.
708000	709000	You were a WoW Widow.
709000	710000	What is a WoW Widow?
710000	715000	Basically, I lost my boyfriend to that goddamn game.
715000	720000	Basically, he would sit in front of his laptop for hours and hours and hours, and we were
720000	726000	supposed to be going out, and would basically ignore me, and I'd sit there watching Will
726000	729000	and Grace, and he'd be sitting there storming the castle, whatever the fuck you do on that
729000	730000	game.
730000	731000	I don't know.
731000	737000	Yeah, so I have a little bit of a grudge against WoW, so I refuse to play it, and every time
737000	739000	I see Rob playing it, I give him shit.
739000	743000	And I give Shane shit, too, because, you know, they both get boners every time they're running
743000	747000	around in their little princess outfits or whatever the fuck it is they're doing.
747000	749000	Excuse me, excuse me.
749000	750000	Miss Sassy Pants over here.
750000	751000	Excuse me, excuse me.
751000	755000	They do not have princess outfits in WoW, because if they did, I would be playing all
755000	757000	day long.
757000	758000	All day long.
758000	759000	I would stop doing Orange Launch Radio.
759000	761000	You know, I have a friend in San Diego.
761000	764000	One of my gays in San Diego plays WoW just so he can dress his characters up in pretty
764000	765000	outfits.
765000	766000	He told me this.
766000	770000	He's like, we have, it's a guild of nothing but women, and we dress our characters up
770000	776000	in pretty outfits, so.
776000	779000	There's so many great things to say, but first Victoria has her gays.
779000	780000	Yes.
780000	781000	Yes.
781000	788000	And there really is just a guild of women that dress up.
788000	794000	A guild of women and Patrick that just dress up and they run around and like, I don't know
794000	797000	what, he says they run around and just, I don't know, do things.
797000	799000	All right.
799000	800000	Yeah.
800000	803000	Do you know what it was your ex-boyfriend was doing in WoW that took so long?
803000	805000	Was he dressing up in princess outfits?
805000	806000	So I'm in the castle.
806000	808000	What is it you do when you play for four hours?
808000	809000	Raiding.
809000	810000	Yes, that.
810000	811000	That.
811000	812000	Okay.
812000	814000	And so, yeah, that's what he would do.
814000	817000	So when, yeah, I broke up with him, you know, to say the least.
817000	819000	Did you tell him that WoW was the reason you were breaking up with him?
819000	825000	Well, it wasn't the main reason, he was a douche, but you know, that had a pretty big
825000	828000	influence on why I am no longer with this person.
828000	829000	All right.
829000	830000	All right.
830000	831000	Fair enough.
831000	834000	So I'm sure we'll get into it later if we're talking about Warcraft stories and you hear
834000	835000	a big, ah!
835000	836000	Oh hell no!
836000	837000	From the corner.
837000	839000	Stop talking about that shit.
839000	840000	All right.
840000	843000	Let's talk about, because we're getting really into the show here, we got news to get to,
843000	844000	let's talk about our gaming week.
844000	848000	So, Loki, you've been awfully quiet through this whole thing.
848000	850000	Welcome back, and how was your gaming week?
850000	851000	My gaming week was fine.
851000	856000	Like I said, I've really only been playing, or trying to play, Grand Theft Auto IV.
856000	860000	Really, I've been seriously trying to get Grand Theft Auto IV PC to work.
860000	866000	Because I, there's a lot of cool mods out there now, and it's kind of sad, because I
866000	872000	was having fun jumping around with no gravity and stuff, and I wanted to put, like, custom
872000	877700	weapons in that did really crazy shit, like make huge explosions or shoot fire and stuff
877700	881000	like that, and now I can't do that.
881000	886240	And, you know, I mean, there's other sandbox games that have come out on the PC, like Saints
886240	889000	Row 2 just came out, but that sucks on the PC.
889000	897000	Horrible port, which, it's just sad, and Rockstar unfortunately is not doing anything to fix
897000	901400	Grand Theft Auto IV, and to be honest, I've never seen a game where I can reinstall it
901400	904900	and it still doesn't work correctly, except for Crysis.
904900	908700	Crysis also didn't work correctly when I reinstalled it, but that was a whole different way.
908700	913900	I couldn't finish that game because, you know, I would get to the general or whatever and
913900	918500	he'd be standing there like a mannequin and couldn't progress any further because the
918500	920000	event didn't trigger.
920000	922600	Well, that sucked.
922600	931300	Other than that, I think I watched Nellie play more Animal Crossing, because now that
931300	932300	I have that game.
932300	933300	What?
933300	934300	Yeah.
934300	935300	You played some Animal Crossing?
935300	936300	Well, not anymore.
936300	938800	I ruined it for her, apparently, because I cheated.
938800	941300	How'd you, were you time traveling?
941300	943100	No, we did that before.
943100	946900	No, this is actually pure cheating now.
946900	953900	They have devices that you can, you know, hack the memory and stuff and give yourself
953900	960900	all this crazy shit, including the download content, because it's pay for unlock content.
960900	968400	Yeah, the game's really boring because it's just Animal Crossing, you know, but they had
968400	969400	some fun codes.
969400	970400	Okay, let me put it this way.
970400	974900	They had a code where you can go into the characters' houses and you can steal their
974900	977800	furniture, move it around and stuff.
977800	978800	That is pretty awesome.
978800	980800	And you can also do it to the stores, too.
980800	983100	You can just go and pick up stuff.
983100	987300	And see, that was funny because, you know, we had maxed out money and there were some
987300	991300	characters that were pissing us off, so we just trapped them in a corner and surrounded
991300	992300	the furniture around them.
992300	996300	And that was mildly satisfying for a second there.
996300	1001900	Yeah, really, what I've been doing with my consoles lately is I've been streaming movies.
1001900	1002900	That's pretty much what I did.
1002900	1005900	I actually downloaded a bunch of the Rift Track shorts last night.
1005900	1008600	We were watching some of those and they're awesome.
1008600	1015340	But yeah, the PS3 actually works really good as a movie streaming thing, except for Windows
1015340	1016340	Media files.
1016340	1017340	I had trouble with that.
1017340	1021800	I had to actually do that with my 360 for some reason because it just did not want to
1021800	1024660	work on the PS3.
1024660	1030020	And then, also, I got the tryout, and I know we have a story on this later, but the new
1030020	1034620	YouTube that's enhanced now for TVs.
1034620	1036900	And it's really nice, actually.
1036900	1038700	Very, very nice looking.
1038700	1041820	Makes full screen video really easy.
1041820	1048300	The layout of it's really big so that you can see it on your TV, and it works great.
1048300	1053020	So definitely something to check out, especially if you're just browsing YouTube stuff or you
1053020	1058620	want to show your friends something, as happened with showing them the new shorts that they
1058620	1066820	did for YouTube Live for Charlie and the Unicorn, or Charlie and the Unicorn.
1066820	1069220	But yeah, that's all that's pretty much going on.
1069220	1074380	This week, though, and hopefully I'll have more to talk about next week, I'm actually
1074380	1081060	getting a preview of the new DJ game coming out, Scratch.
1081060	1084300	They're going to actually show us everything, and they're bringing me a turntable I get
1084300	1087300	to keep, so that's pretty cool.
1087300	1090580	That's the one that Newark's actually doing the turntable for.
1090580	1095260	And the only thing I don't like about it, though, is it's all urban and hip-hop music,
1095260	1099780	but it makes sense in that game because there's not a lot of scratching in techno music, so
1099780	1100780	I mean...
1100780	1105300	Yeah, I was going to say, that's kind of the music that is produced by turntables.
1105300	1108900	I just wish there was some more house music, and maybe there is, but I'll find out more
1108900	1112400	this week, I get to see it on Thursday, so I'm pretty psyched about that.
1112400	1115060	So definitely tune back in next week for Loki's review.
1115060	1116060	Yes.
1116060	1117060	Sweet.
1117060	1118060	Sweet.
1118060	1119980	Alright, Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
1119980	1121440	Victoria grabbed your boob.
1121440	1124500	I know, I just didn't want to acknowledge it on air, but thank you for doing that.
1124500	1126340	Glad I would.
1126340	1130980	I totally downloaded Samurai Shodown 2 on Virtual Console, and I was having good times
1130980	1134940	with that, because that was one of my original fighting games that I loved to play all the
1134940	1135940	time.
1135940	1137660	So I was playing that for a while.
1137660	1138660	Who's your character?
1138660	1140660	Galford, because he has a dog.
1140660	1146140	That's the only reason I ever played it, because Galford was on there, and he was hot.
1146140	1147140	What else?
1147140	1148140	PopCap games.
1148140	1153220	Oh, I got Silent Hill Origins for Christmas, kind of late, you know, because it came out.
1153220	1154220	On the PlayStation 2?
1154220	1155220	Yeah.
1155220	1156220	Oh!
1156220	1157220	How is it?
1157220	1159500	It's not the best Silent Hill.
1159500	1166500	It's not bad, but it's different, yeah, because it was made by some European team, but it's
1166500	1167500	not bad.
1167500	1169940	Did you ever play Silent Hill 5?
1169940	1170940	No?
1170940	1172300	I want to, but no.
1172300	1175420	Technically it's Silent Hill Homecoming, but whatever.
1175420	1176420	Homecoming 5.
1176420	1180860	Isn't it only on the- Silent Hill The Room, you know, that's 4, whatever, I don't give
1180860	1181860	a crap.
1181860	1183380	Yeah, isn't it on the Xbox?
1183380	1184380	360 and PS3.
1184380	1185380	PS3, yeah.
1185380	1186380	I don't have any of those.
1186380	1188780	Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting.
1188780	1189780	You're stubborn.
1189780	1190780	But you have friends.
1190780	1191780	Yeah, you know me.
1191780	1192780	Yeah.
1192780	1197660	Do I have to come over here and play, because I am so fucking lazy, I'm not going to drive
1197660	1198660	here.
1198660	1202820	Like, I love Silent Hill, but I also love not driving places, so.
1202820	1203820	Alright.
1203820	1206020	One of these days, I'm sure.
1206020	1208780	Maybe I'll pull a Victoria and, like, stay the weekend at your house.
1208780	1212180	Can we tell that story real quick, can we, can we, the reason why Victoria's here on
1212180	1213180	the show tonight?
1213180	1215900	Victoria, why don't you tell our listeners why you're here on the program tonight?
1215900	1220900	So I'm kind of dumb, and I just, I'm opening a hotel right now, there's a new hotel opening
1220900	1228040	out in, about, you know, maybe 20 miles from where I live, and so basically we're going
1228040	1231940	in and out and cleaning all the hotel rooms, big issues, no sawdust, all that shit.
1231940	1237220	And I'm a genius and lost my keys at work, and so I basically had to search high and
1237220	1241780	low through all the hotel rooms that I cleaned on Friday.
1241780	1247820	Yeah, and my roommate isn't home because she's in Sonoma seeing her boyfriend, so she's not
1247820	1251580	going to be home until tomorrow, so I'm basically stuck at Rob's house until tomorrow, imposing
1251580	1256040	on his good hospitality and all that, all that nonsense, and I'm very grateful to him
1256040	1257500	for letting me stay here.
1257500	1258500	That's right, bitch.
1258500	1259500	You better, you better gush.
1259500	1261380	If not, I'd be sleeping in my car.
1261380	1262780	Tell listeners about how wonderful I am.
1262780	1264620	Oh yeah, he's so good to me.
1264620	1268620	Alright, anyway, I just thought that was my story.
1268620	1272060	I was going to say, there was one game I did forget about that I actually played this week,
1272060	1273060	Ninja Blade.
1273060	1275980	I played the demo for that, which is pretty cool.
1275980	1280020	The game, I mean, looks kind of like a rip-off of Ninja Gaiden 2.
1280020	1284380	It's actually more of a rip-off of Conan or God of War, I mean, the game plays very similar
1284380	1285380	to that.
1285380	1290220	You have three different weapons, you know, with varying speed and damage, and it's all
1290220	1295540	ninja-themed and stuff, but then there's a lot of quick-time event cutscenes that are
1295540	1299700	in the game, which are pretty cool-looking, just very cinematic and action-packed.
1299700	1305420	There's one scene where you're actually running down the side of a skyscraper and killing
1305420	1309380	these dragon-looking monster things, which are pretty awesome.
1309380	1311700	So it's definitely worth checking out.
1311700	1312740	It's not crap.
1312740	1316900	It's definitely not Vampire Reigns, so that'll be a good one to check out.
1316900	1322060	I think it's coming out the end of March now, but it's one of those secondary From Software
1322060	1324300	games that Microsoft's publishing.
1324300	1327420	Good times, good times.
1327420	1331260	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
1331260	1334820	So Victoria, you know how you can extend your stay here at Rob's?
1334820	1339260	Do his laundry, do his dishes, clean his house?
1339260	1344060	The guy that I was seeing told me to cook for him, but he's all diet-y and stuff.
1344060	1346260	I wanted to give Loki the presents I got him from Hawaii.
1346260	1347540	Why didn't you get me?
1347540	1352100	So I got him an authentic dashboard hula girl doll, because I thought he'd like that.
1352100	1354460	I got Jamie one too, she'll find out about that next week.
1354460	1357780	And then I got some, since you like food, I got you some macadamia nut covered toffee,
1357780	1359220	which is really good.
1359220	1360420	So eat it.
1360420	1361420	It's amazing.
1361420	1362420	I'll give this to Nellie.
1362420	1363420	Eat it.
1363420	1364420	Nellie will like it too.
1364420	1366540	Yes.
1366540	1367540	So there you go.
1367540	1368540	Thank you very much.
1368540	1369540	All right.
1369540	1370540	Sorry about that.
1370540	1371540	I just remembered that.
1371540	1373460	So you were, what, you were done with your gaming week too then?
1373460	1374460	Rice Princess?
1374460	1375460	What else?
1375460	1379120	Victoria, I don't know if there's been anything you've been playing, but why don't you share?
1379120	1380820	I played rock band with Rob yesterday.
1380820	1381820	Oh yeah.
1381820	1385100	We made a band, the Shrieking Beavers.
1385100	1386100	Yeah.
1386100	1387100	Yeah.
1387100	1390940	And then I have a game on my phone that I've been playing, but that's as, you know, awesome
1390940	1392340	as it gets.
1392340	1393340	What game on your phone?
1393340	1394340	It's called Pump Jack.
1394340	1395340	It's like a little, you're like a little-
1395340	1396340	It sounds dirty.
1396340	1397340	I know, right?
1397340	1398340	I know, right?
1398340	1399340	Wow.
1399340	1400340	No, it came with my sidekick.
1400340	1404140	So like, it's like your little wheel and you have to go collect all the gas cans and you
1404140	1407500	have to avoid the little cactuses that can explode and kill you.
1407500	1408500	And then you Pump Jack.
1408500	1409500	Pump Jack.
1409500	1410500	Yeah.
1410500	1413700	No, and I've been playing it for like, I've been playing it since I got my damn phone,
1413700	1416060	which is almost a year, and I still haven't beaten it.
1416060	1418980	I'm on like the last level and it's driving me crazy that I can't win.
1418980	1422020	Which goes to show you why I don't play video games, because I get frustrated and then I
1422020	1424140	just don't want to play anymore.
1424140	1425140	So.
1425140	1427660	Well, we have an interesting story later on that might appeal to you.
1427660	1428660	I'll talk about that.
1428660	1429660	Bring it.
1429660	1431100	Like what they're doing for frustrated people like you.
1431100	1432260	Fabulous.
1432260	1433260	My gaming week.
1433260	1434340	I haven't played a lot of new things.
1434340	1436660	I've kind of recycled a lot of the older games I have.
1436660	1438500	Like of course I've been playing WoW.
1438500	1439660	I've been playing a lot of little big-
1439660	1440660	Shut up.
1440660	1443140	I've been playing a lot of little big planet.
1443140	1446340	I don't remember if I ever talked about it on the show, but I was playing Suikoden, the
1446340	1448220	old school one for PlayStation 1.
1448220	1449220	Like I was playing that like crazy.
1449220	1452500	I haven't really touched it since I got back from Hawaii, because I got to a part of the
1452500	1453700	game where it actually got hard again.
1453700	1457780	So I'm getting to the Victoria level of frustration with it, but I'll go back and try to beat
1457780	1459660	it at some point.
1459660	1461660	And then as far as new stuff I've been playing.
1461660	1464940	The new stuff I've been playing is on the iPhone, which is kind of interesting.
1464940	1467060	Konami put out some interesting games this week.
1467060	1475280	They put out a demo for Dance Dance Revolution, the new iPhone DDR game, which is interesting.
1475280	1477540	Its biggest problem is like it's choppy.
1477540	1481700	Like seriously, if you think that Xbox frame rate thing is an issue, try playing DDR on
1481700	1482700	your iPhone.
1482700	1483700	It's pretty horrible.
1483700	1484700	But it's very pretty.
1484700	1487700	Like for a cell phone game, it's actually very pretty looking and the sounds very good
1487700	1490000	because obviously iPhones or iPods.
1490000	1493900	So the music is obviously full quality, which is kind of nice.
1493900	1497180	And basically what it is, a little dance pad shows up at the bottom of your screen and
1497180	1498180	you play with your fingers.
1498180	1502860	You dance with your fingers to the music, which is, you know, cute, but I don't know
1502860	1503860	how.
1503860	1505180	I mean, luckily it's free.
1505180	1506180	It's free.
1506180	1507180	So you can't complain.
1507180	1508180	Totally free.
1508180	1509620	But it's just the one song for free.
1509620	1510980	So just one song.
1510980	1511980	Yeah.
1511980	1512980	It's one song.
1512980	1513980	Wow.
1513980	1516700	But it's like a preview of what they're working on or something.
1516700	1517700	All right.
1517700	1520420	The other game I got on the iPhone is Silent Hill.
1520420	1522260	They actually have on the iPhone now.
1522260	1523940	It's a new version of it.
1523940	1527100	I think it's called Silent Hill, the revenge.
1527100	1529180	I can't remember the name of it.
1529180	1531400	I'm actually looking it up on my phone right now.
1531400	1535060	It's called, let me see, I'm learning it right now.
1535060	1537500	Basically in this game, you have these little mini mazes.
1537500	1543100	It looks like the old school dungeon explorer game from the Turbo Graphics 16, the escape.
1543100	1544100	That's what it's called.
1544100	1545100	Silent Hill, the escape.
1545100	1547780	Let me see if I can get some of the music for you guys.
1547780	1551660	Your fingers and you just hit the buttons and like, that's how you play it and there's
1551660	1556700	only one level.
1556700	1559740	I have no idea if they can hear that over the air, but a little bit of what it sounds
1559740	1560740	like.
1560740	1562160	No, you actually, it uses the touch screen.
1562160	1563760	It's a whole new interface that uses the touch screen.
1563760	1567340	You can slide back and forth to move through the maze and you turn left and right.
1567340	1571260	And then to fire your gun, you tap on the crosshair to fire the gun.
1571260	1573700	And the crosshair is all tilt sensitive.
1573700	1575760	So if you want to aim up and down, you tilt.
1575760	1581500	So you will run across these nurses in the maze and you can blow their brains out basically.
1581500	1583900	It's not really a Silent Hill game.
1583900	1589300	It's basically a dungeon crawling game that they've slapped Silent Hill graphics onto.
1589300	1590740	Surely you just, Rob.
1590740	1593620	Well, Silent Hill is all about avoiding things.
1593620	1596760	You don't necessarily have to shoot everything in the face, you know what I mean?
1596760	1598380	But this game kind of encourages that.
1598380	1599380	Thanks, Rob.
1599380	1600380	I do encourage people.
1600380	1601380	I appreciate you explaining it to me.
1601380	1602380	Shut up.
1602380	1604660	But I'm telling you, for the listeners, you know what I mean?
1604660	1605660	I know, I know.
1605660	1606660	I don't know what it's about.
1606660	1607660	I've seen the movie.
1607660	1608660	And you didn't like the movie, did you?
1608660	1609660	I was pissed at the end.
1609660	1610660	I was like, what the fuck is this?
1610660	1616900	But it's more one of those things that's much better if you've played the game.
1616900	1622180	So yeah, Silent Hill on the iPhone is kind of, eh, I mean, it's only $8.
1622180	1623940	You can be honest.
1623940	1624940	You know what?
1624940	1625940	Here's the thing.
1625940	1627680	It's actually a really smooth running game.
1627680	1629620	The controls are kind of interesting.
1629620	1632660	The way you play, no, compared to DDR, like the frame rate is much better.
1632660	1633980	It runs a lot smoothly.
1633980	1637620	For a mobile phone game, the graphics are actually pretty good.
1637620	1641900	And if you play with headphones, the sound and stuff is actually kind of neat.
1641900	1645400	So it's actually not a bad game.
1645400	1649180	It's just kind of short and not really Silent Hill.
1649180	1650180	That's the thing.
1650180	1656260	So, I mean, if you want to get kind of an interesting maze exploring game that you shoot
1656260	1658540	things in, get this game.
1658540	1661780	Or if you want like a, you know, just, it's a cute little time waster.
1661780	1665980	I mean, there's only like six levels, so I don't know if it's necessarily worth $8.
1665980	1671420	I think maybe $5 would have been a better price point for this, but you know, whatever,
1671420	1672420	I guess.
1672420	1673420	That's just, yeah.
1673420	1678620	When I think of Silent Hill, I totally think of shooting my way out of a maze.
1678620	1682260	They had to come up with like, they try, you know, they have these little story elements
1682260	1684020	that are in it too, although not much.
1684020	1686940	I haven't seen Pyramid Head yet, but I might not have just played far enough.
1686940	1689060	I mean, it's, it's, it's all right.
1689060	1691620	It's you have to remember it's a mobile phone game.
1691620	1694180	If your expectations are high, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment.
1694180	1695180	I know.
1695180	1699300	Or they just make it a generic game or something like it's nothing like Silent Hill.
1699300	1700300	Well, it is.
1700300	1706140	Cause then it wouldn't get sold if they didn't put Silent Hill on it.
1706140	1707700	That's pretty much it right there.
1707700	1710620	But what's interesting about this is that, hey, there's a Metal Gear game coming out
1710620	1712980	and a lot of people are like, OMG, Metal Gear on the phone.
1712980	1715020	Well, if it's anything like this, don't get your hopes up.
1715020	1716700	It is exactly, actually it's worse than that.
1716700	1718300	It's a real shooter.
1718300	1720220	Then it's not even going to be anything.
1720220	1724100	And then a pad comes up and you just use your fingers to hit the buttons and it's only one
1724100	1725100	song.
1725100	1726100	Yeah.
1726100	1727100	Yeah.
1727100	1728100	There you go.
1728100	1729100	Womp, womp, womp.
1729100	1730100	All right.
1730100	1731100	So there it is.
1731100	1733460	That, that was my quick review on the Silent Hill, the escape, the iPhone game.
1733460	1737060	Uh, otherwise I don't think I've really been playing a lot of new stuff.
1737060	1742780	Um, you know, just playing the same old stuff on, well, there's console games too.
1742780	1745660	Yes, I played Violet hold with you.
1745660	1746660	I'm the best warrior.
1746660	1747660	There you go.
1747660	1748660	All right.
1748660	1751820	Let's, uh, let's start to get into some gaming news tonight, but first I just want to say
1751820	1753780	a couple quick housekeeping announcements.
1753780	1755740	Really dark soccer is not here tonight.
1755740	1760220	Um, which, you know, is probably pretty obvious cause the show is completely getting off base.
1760220	1764220	Uh, cause you know, when, when Jamie's not here to keep us in line, uh, the show just
1764220	1765220	goes crazy.
1765220	1766580	Uh, so she's not here tonight.
1766580	1770460	We will still have a classic game of the week tonight, um, that I believe I'm doing or did
1770460	1774300	the Deloki find something he's doing, uh, we'll figure it out.
1774300	1779620	Uh, so we'll do that in a little later on and, uh, she'll be back next week and, uh,
1779620	1783180	we apparently also in housekeeping tonight, we have a brand new orange launch radio website
1783180	1784180	coming soon.
1784180	1787160	It looks like, cause the beta looks great.
1787160	1789680	And if you're in chat right now, just ask a deep man.
1789680	1791480	He did a awesome.
1791480	1792480	He did.
1792480	1794140	It doesn't look like it was made in the early two thousands.
1794140	1795140	It doesn't.
1795140	1797020	It looks, it looks very modern.
1797020	1798020	It's still simple though.
1798020	1799020	Is what I like about it.
1799020	1802460	He didn't, he didn't load it up with like a bunch of crap.
1802460	1805740	It still looks efficient, which would be cool.
1805740	1807620	So I'm, I'm very excited.
1807620	1812020	So big thank you to deep man and we'll find other ways to thank him later on when the
1812020	1813140	site goes live.
1813140	1817540	People will send, we'll send, uh, we'll send Victoria out there to babysit cause he's married.
1817540	1822620	So Victoria can go babysit.
1822620	1826500	I have a 10 year old brother and I want to kill him every time I see him, I can't stand
1826500	1827500	children.
1827500	1829860	No, I don't, I don't hurt him.
1829860	1832980	I just, you know, kind of pulls, I kind of pull his hair a little bit and smack him in
1832980	1836180	the head and tell him to quit looking like a little girl with his John Lennon hair.
1836180	1841140	But you know, doesn't your 10, doesn't your 10 year old brother play grand theft auto?
1841140	1845980	Yeah, he does, he called me on Christmas day asking me to find him cheat codes for grand
1845980	1849460	theft auto four and I said, God damn it, you have the fucking internet.
1849460	1852060	Look it up yourself to your 10 year old brother.
1852060	1854060	He knows I love him.
1854060	1856180	He shouldn't be playing grand theft auto four anyway.
1856180	1859900	I was playing grand theft auto since he was like six.
1859900	1863380	My dad thought it was appropriate to buy him GTA three when he was six.
1863380	1864380	Okay.
1864380	1865380	Yeah.
1865380	1868580	So it's fabulous parenting on my parents' part.
1868580	1869580	Yes.
1869580	1872140	And I just wonder how I turned out so normal.
1872140	1873940	All right.
1873940	1880100	Anyhow, let's get into some gaming news for the love of God.
1880100	1881100	Gaming news.
1881100	1882100	Yes.
1882100	1883100	Loki, please.
1883100	1885380	Well, we got to do some stuff from last week first though, right?
1885380	1886380	Yes.
1886380	1887380	Okay.
1887380	1888380	So let's start with last week's news.
1888380	1892900	Last week we had CES and of course there wasn't a whole lot of game news coming out, but Microsoft
1892900	1895620	did show off one thing that was kind of neat.
1895620	1901660	Their brand new community game, um, that's actually kind of a game making program.
1901660	1906140	Now we talked about this on the program before when it was called Boku.
1906140	1910980	Now they've decided to change the name to kudo or kodo kodo.
1910980	1915140	I mean, Boku, kudo, kodo, but who cares?
1915140	1916140	Okay.
1916140	1922460	So kodo anyways, it's basically a very simplified game making program.
1922460	1925100	Um, they're comparing it to a little big planet.
1925100	1930220	I don't think it's anything like little big planet at all, but, um, it's kind of object
1930220	1935420	oriented programming stuff and you can use the characters and stuff in there, um, to
1935420	1937100	basically create your own little games.
1937100	1941900	They're all kind of pixelated looking cause the blocks in the game are actually very Lego
1941900	1942900	like.
1942900	1944700	So it's kind of neat.
1944700	1947900	Um, so yeah, you can basically make games.
1947900	1950220	They have 200 building blocks right now.
1950220	1952260	I'm sure there'll be more available for download.
1952260	1957940	Uh, no word on when it's coming out, supposedly later this year and, um, you'll be able to,
1957940	1958940	I guess, make games.
1958940	1965060	I don't know if it will be available also on, um, their community game service cause
1965060	1969580	that could be really messy if there's that many community games on there, you know, as
1969580	1974140	if it was hard enough for some of these community game developers to get their game notice.
1974140	1978140	They have all these crappy Boku levels.
1978140	1979140	I don't know.
1979140	1980580	Or, uh, kodo levels.
1980580	1984380	Well, yeah, one of these days I want to get, um, Aaron back on the show.
1984380	1987300	I'm hoping he'll listen at one point, but he's the guy who did snake three 60.
1987300	1990420	Like I want to talk to him now, like six weeks out after his game has been released and see
1990420	1995380	how it, I saw him respond back to a, there was an IGN review of his game or something
1995380	1999300	there really about like the hot or not of like community games.
1999300	2003100	And his was actually in the not section and the reasons and the reasons that they gave
2003100	2004100	her retarded.
2004100	2008640	They're all, Oh, it's snake game and it totally looked like that the guy did not play the
2008640	2009640	game at all.
2009640	2014140	So it was, it was retarded, but it was funny cause he's just, you know, called him out
2014140	2015140	on it.
2015140	2017700	He's like, um, doesn't sound like you played this at all.
2017700	2021220	And you actually, there's a lot of features that you didn't mention.
2021220	2025300	And um, you know, there's some other games that was just like crap that they gave good
2025300	2026300	reviews for.
2026300	2029540	But remember it's just one person's review and you know, just because they happen to
2029540	2034620	be behind a website and you know, their voice unfortunately is a little bit louder than everybody
2034620	2035620	else's.
2035620	2041600	Well, there's a lot of voices that got a little quieter last week and this is huge news, huge
2041600	2044980	news throughout the community, especially, um, you know, on the type of websites.
2044980	2048620	I think those of you guys that listen to these types of independent podcasts, I'm sure you
2048620	2050180	guys read a lot of gaming blogs.
2050180	2052060	You see a lot of this, so it's no news to you guys.
2052060	2058980	I'm sure that a UGO bought the one up network, uh, this week and uh, basically it caused,
2058980	2064660	you know, long story short, uh, it caused EGM to go under electronic gaming monthly.
2064660	2070300	The magazine is no more and uh, lots and lots of folks that were working at one up.com goodbye,
2070300	2076560	including the people that were doing the one up show and uh, one up was one up yours was
2076560	2077560	the video show.
2077560	2080020	I'm going to be honest guys, it's so fun.
2080020	2083700	Here's the thing, you know, there's not a lot of extra news to talk about with us.
2083700	2087040	I'm sure you guys all read it in the week we were gone, so you all are probably pretty
2087040	2088040	familiar with it.
2088040	2092360	If not, go look on any blog that was running last week and I'm sure you'll read about it.
2092360	2097100	It's very interesting, like really how much love was out there for these shows and this
2097100	2103100	site, which was interesting to me because honestly I've never ever watched it or listened
2103100	2104740	to a show of theirs, but I don't do it.
2104740	2106540	That's, that's my policy across the board.
2106540	2111580	There's very, very, very few shows that I listened to because I don't want to inadvertently
2111580	2112580	steal ideas.
2112580	2113580	If that makes sense.
2113580	2114580	Does that make sense?
2114580	2115580	That makes sense.
2115580	2116580	You know, we've done a show for like seven years.
2116580	2119380	I don't want to be accused of ripping something off of somebody else.
2119380	2123700	And no offense, but that's going to happen anyway, even if I don't watch them.
2123700	2126980	People are going to say we stole stuff, but whatever.
2126980	2132140	So and to be honest, I don't even know who UGO is.
2132140	2136260	I mean, I've never heard of them as a website.
2136260	2140700	Don't they run a lot of other sites for entertainment, movies, things of that nature.
2140700	2146460	They're trying to be like a one, not one, an IGN type of service, but I've never visited
2146460	2151940	them ever and you know, I don't know, I just have never heard of them.
2151940	2157900	It's, you know, maybe that's my own ignorance, but I've never heard of them at all and the
2157900	2163300	fact that they're teaming up with 1UP now or they bought them out means nothing to me
2163300	2170100	because I haven't visited 1UP in months and I just don't, same with GameSpot.
2170100	2171900	It's just done with it.
2171900	2175020	Well, here's what's interesting is that my comment on this, the first thing I was thinking
2175020	2179780	of because I read about this when I was out in Hawaii and I was kind of my first thought
2179780	2181980	was, okay, we're going to have to talk about this on the show at some point.
2181980	2186940	My kind of thought on this is this will be a chance to see how much these guys that were
2186940	2192460	producing these shows and doing this stuff were really into video games and really into
2192460	2198900	their craft because as many independent podcasts have shown for years and years and years,
2198900	2203000	you don't have to get paid to do this stuff if you really, really enjoy it.
2203000	2207020	So my kind of thing was I was going to say, well guys, here you go, here's your chance
2207020	2211560	to keep doing what you do just because this may not be the day job anymore.
2211560	2214440	You can still keep it going and they have.
2214440	2219700	So props to them because now there is the whole Rebel FM I think it's called and I think
2219700	2221940	there's another one called Geek Box.
2221940	2224680	So props to them for continuing to do it.
2224680	2229040	So I'm kind of curious to see how much this is going to go and kind of where some of these
2229040	2230040	guys end up.
2230040	2233460	If this is the same thing that's going to happen, remember, that's how we got This Week
2233460	2234460	in Tech.
2234460	2235460	True.
2235460	2242460	I mean, you know, follow up from Tech TV, so, I don't know, and I'm sure that they'll
2242460	2248940	make it just as well and probably even better now that they're away from 1UP, so.
2248940	2250180	Why do you say that?
2250180	2253620	Just because, like look at This Week in Tech, I think they're doing very well and I think
2253620	2258940	that if they were still part of G4, you know, the whole Tech TV thing, I think they wouldn't
2258940	2262260	be doing as well as they are now, independently.
2262260	2267020	Less influence from other things that are more corporate oriented.
2267020	2268020	Interesting.
2268020	2269660	Well, good luck.
2269660	2275620	I mean, it's never fun to talk about job layoffs, but good luck to those folks and good luck
2275620	2277140	to 1UP, too.
2277140	2282060	Stand kind of on top of things now because they've been, of course, they've taken a lot
2282060	2284780	of negative press over this whole thing, so I don't know.
2284780	2289380	I got to ask you, Rice Princess, because you were on 1UP for quite some time, like years
2289380	2292500	ago when I was posting on there and participating on the site, you were kind of the one that
2292500	2295580	got me into that and I think you kind of hung out there for a little while after that.
2295580	2297540	What do you think about all this news about it closing?
2297540	2301900	Is 1UP a site you would still visit or are you like, eh, the people are gone, whatever?
2301900	2307220	It's interesting because, yeah, I actually did revisit my 1UP account like a couple weeks
2307220	2311500	ago, actually, before any of this ever happened and I still have the same friends and stuff.
2311500	2316940	I didn't really do anything, but I mean, it's always sad when a community, a group of people
2316940	2320300	just, you know, can't meet at the same place anymore.
2320300	2324180	It's like having your favorite local coffee shop or something close down.
2324180	2325180	It's just like, oh, that sucks.
2325180	2326180	But, you know.
2326180	2327180	You just moved to a new coffee shop.
2327180	2328180	I know.
2328180	2329180	That's what I'm saying.
2329180	2331820	People can, you know, get each other's information, go to another place and do it.
2331820	2336140	But, you know, you can go to another coffee shop, but it might not be as cool or as quirky
2336140	2337140	or whatever.
2337140	2343660	Now, you know, the thing is, in defense, I guess you would say to, you know, UGO, you
2343660	2349380	know, print gaming press, I think it's going to be gone in a few years anyways.
2349380	2354600	It's just that they can't really compete unless you're like, you know, Game Informer or something
2354600	2355600	like that.
2355600	2359980	And you're, you know, cutting deals with these publishers to have the exclusive story and
2359980	2360980	stuff.
2360980	2365260	But even still, people know now not to even bother reading that because they can just
2365260	2368460	read that same story on the internet when someone gets their copy of the magazine, relays
2368460	2371380	what's in there, as well as all the media that was on there.
2371380	2377380	It's just the internet's so instantaneous now that print press is just becoming kind
2377380	2378380	of dated.
2378380	2379380	Yeah.
2379380	2383060	The electronic gaming monthly news is especially sad because, you know, I think a lot of us
2383060	2385460	remember that magazine from years and years ago.
2385460	2386460	I grew up.
2386460	2387460	Yeah.
2387460	2388460	Don't get me wrong.
2388460	2392220	It was like the best gaming magazine out there years ago when the internet didn't exist.
2392220	2393220	Yeah.
2393220	2396380	But here's the thing is that I know a lot of people are really sad about EGM going away
2396380	2397740	and to me to an extent too.
2397740	2398740	Am I sad?
2398740	2399740	Yes.
2399740	2400740	Am I surprised?
2400740	2401740	Not really.
2401740	2402740	But here's the thing.
2402740	2405740	That magazine has been dead to me for 10 years.
2405740	2410260	Like I, I remember that magazine like back in the day, you know, like, Oh my God, that
2410260	2415380	issue where they actually had the, um, Shang Long lie in it for the April Fools.
2415380	2417580	I fricking had that issue with the magazine.
2417580	2418580	I remember that.
2418580	2419580	Yeah.
2419580	2422980	Like I remember some of that stuff happening, but honestly, like I stopped.
2422980	2425140	I stopped subscribing to that a long time ago.
2425140	2426620	A lot of people did.
2426620	2430540	So for me it was more of the news of, uh, Oh, well, you know, that's too bad.
2430540	2434860	That's an icon of my youth that's going away, but I'm not surprised.
2434860	2435860	Yeah.
2435860	2442000	I mean, with the advent of, you know, internet news outlets and especially blogs, blogs are
2442000	2446520	becoming more popular than, you know, normal media sites because people like to identify
2446520	2451220	with other people who are on their level, who are normal, who can give, you know, a
2451220	2453980	perspective, you know, that's not like corporate.
2453980	2457660	And a big purpose for magazines now in this day and age is to read when you're on the
2457660	2461860	toilet, but now that they have iPhones, you can look at blogs when you're on the toilet
2461860	2462860	now.
2462860	2463860	You can.
2463860	2464860	Yes.
2464860	2465860	Yeah.
2465860	2466860	Just don't.
2466860	2467860	That's what I do.
2467860	2468860	So you don't, I don't even need magazines anymore.
2468860	2471060	I can look at websites.
2471060	2472060	Only a wow.
2472060	2473060	What Victoria?
2473060	2474060	What you want?
2474060	2475060	Nasty ho.
2475060	2476060	Okay.
2476060	2477060	We don't want to know what you're doing.
2477060	2478060	You're taking a dump.
2478060	2482900	Look, everybody poops, haven't you ever read that book?
2482900	2485180	Everybody poops.
2485180	2489540	If you wipe your butt and you get a little bit of poop on your finger and you put it
2489540	2493420	on your thing, you can't throw it away like a magazine.
2493420	2494420	Stop it.
2494420	2496940	I'm down with the old school magazines being in my bathroom.
2496940	2497940	You know that.
2497940	2502180	You see all the maxims lined up like on my toilet.
2502180	2504120	We can move away from that now.
2504120	2507980	But what I'm talking about is, is that, you know, people used to have the magazines or
2507980	2512380	the, what was it, the bathroom reader books or whatever, but now we can have the internet
2512380	2514700	even when we're pooping.
2514700	2515700	We could.
2515700	2518220	So we can look at blogs and all that there.
2518220	2520100	I guess you're right about that.
2520100	2523100	It's gross, but yeah.
2523100	2528860	So magazine, I'm just saying magazines are, are, it's one last use is going away.
2528860	2531340	Oh, I'm holding your laptop right now.
2531340	2533140	You've had this in the bathroom with you.
2533140	2534140	Haven't you?
2534140	2535140	Oh yeah.
2535140	2537140	There's poop somewhere on here, isn't there?
2537140	2538140	Oh, damn it.
2538140	2541860	Why are the keys so sticky, Rob?
2541860	2542860	You're disgusting.
2542860	2544740	Somebody burned my hands off.
2544740	2546380	All right, please.
2546380	2547380	Let's move on.
2547380	2548380	For God's sake.
2548380	2549380	All right.
2549380	2553060	Well, there's a rumor coming from IGN.
2553060	2559620	They have multiple sources close to Nintendo that have told the site that, um, the TSI
2559620	2567300	will be out in the US on April 4th at $179.
2567300	2569540	I somehow don't believe this.
2569540	2570940	And why is that that you don't believe this?
2570940	2574140	Well, there's just a few things that strike me as weird.
2574140	2579780	Nintendo for some reason likes releasing their stuff, especially hardware, on Sundays, and
2579780	2582220	the 4th is actually a Saturday.
2582220	2583220	For one.
2583220	2586820	Actually, that's my only thing, is that it's a Saturday, not a Sunday.
2586820	2588460	Therefore I am calling the whole thing book.
2588460	2592900	I don't know, it doesn't really matter, and I think if anything, they would want to hold
2592900	2600620	off on selling the DSi, because they've been selling tons of DS's already, and I think
2600620	2605180	if they bring the DSi out, it's just going to cut into their DS sales.
2605180	2611060	And they're not really having trouble selling DS systems, and I don't know, there's not
2611060	2616820	really any DSi software out, even in Japan right now, other than the download stuff,
2616820	2619860	but I guess, I don't know.
2619860	2623180	Of course, they could always just cut the price of the DS that's out there right now
2623180	2625260	by like 20 bucks and release the DSi.
2625260	2630700	For $99.99, yeah, then people will start making love to DS's like crazy or something.
2630700	2634900	Exactly, and then they'll sell both, because you'll have the more high priced ones for
2634900	2637380	folks that want the camera and all that stuff.
2637380	2638380	They could do it.
2638380	2641420	But yeah, what Loki says about the date is especially interesting, because Nintendo does
2641420	2642420	usually do a Sunday.
2642420	2646420	I wonder if it doesn't mean maybe shipping on April 4th to store on April 5th?
2646420	2649820	No, you can't have a ship date on Saturday, it wouldn't make any sense, because no one
2649820	2651580	ships on Saturdays.
2651580	2653680	They would street it for a Sunday.
2653680	2658540	So okay, whatever, maybe it's April 5th, I mean, big deal.
2658540	2660420	I don't know, I think it's just a big rumor right now.
2660420	2666540	I think if anything, they'll announce something later, I don't know, it doesn't really seem
2666540	2671820	like there'd be any reason to release this now, I mean, there's just a few download games
2671820	2672820	and that's it.
2672820	2675220	It's just not really that worthwhile.
2675220	2681660	I don't know if the DS was kind of tanking a little bit, not really tanking, but if sales
2681660	2685720	are starting to drop off a little bit in Japan, and maybe that's why they released the DSi,
2685720	2690940	but I don't think they're dropping off at all, I mean, we're still selling tons of DS
2690940	2693300	systems, not having a problem whatsoever.
2693300	2697080	Some comments from chatroom on this story, Cy says, I think their strategy is that Nintendo
2697080	2702820	fans will buy the 179DSi and most people will buy the DS Lite at regular, kind of similar
2702820	2703820	to what I was saying.
2703820	2707780	Yeah, so the DSi is for hardcore gamers, yeah, uh-huh, sure.
2707780	2710860	Or people who want the extra garbage that it's gonna have.
2710860	2713180	Xlink says, and you can take it to the bathroom.
2713180	2716180	You can indeed play your DS in the bathroom, and I'm sure there's people that do that.
2716180	2718980	Yeah, and it has a really crappy, you know, jump browser.
2718980	2719980	No pun intended.
2719980	2724500	Yeah, it has a horrible web browser built into it as well, so.
2724500	2729460	Bobby says, Activision Blizzard doesn't want the DSi released because their best-selling
2729460	2731060	DS game won't be compatible.
2731060	2733100	Guitar Hero on tour.
2733100	2734100	Yes.
2734100	2737340	Well, Activision Blizzard don't have a say in it, so...
2737340	2738340	Poop on them.
2738340	2739340	I don't know.
2739340	2740340	It's just...
2740340	2741340	This show is really poop-filled.
2741340	2745820	They'll just come out with another peripheral that'll plug into the SD card slot, and then
2745820	2747980	they can make their crappy games.
2747980	2751100	They're gonna have, like, some stupid drum peripheral.
2751100	2754580	I don't know, all their DS guitar games suck.
2754580	2756700	I'm sorry, it's just...
2756700	2759540	It's retarded to play Guitar Hero on the DS.
2759540	2760540	I said it.
2760540	2761540	There you go.
2761540	2768380	It's also retarded to play Dance Dance Revolution on iPhone, a PSP, or a DS, because it makes
2768380	2769380	no sense.
2769380	2770780	Yeah, you're not dancing.
2770780	2771780	You're not dancing.
2771780	2772780	You're not...
2772780	2773780	I don't know.
2773780	2774780	I have to concur with you on there.
2774780	2780180	Even though I used to play, like, DDR, like, with the remote control, like, when I couldn't
2780180	2781780	afford to go to the arcade.
2781780	2786140	What's one of the biggest iPhone games right now, in fact, so big that Apple actually displays
2786140	2788380	it on a big banner inside their store?
2788380	2789500	Silent Hill The Escape.
2789500	2790860	No, not Silent Hill The Escape.
2790860	2794540	Tap Tap Revenge.
2794540	2797500	Tap Tap Revenge is like a somewhat DDR clone.
2797500	2798500	Hit the buttons.
2798500	2799500	No.
2799500	2800780	It's a clone of Amplitude.
2800780	2802140	No, it's not.
2802140	2803260	I've played the game.
2803260	2805620	It's like Guitar Hero, if anything else.
2805620	2807820	The notes scroll down and you tap.
2807820	2810620	That's what it's closest to, is Guitar Hero.
2810620	2812380	But still, though, you're not dancing, though.
2812380	2813420	That's the thing.
2813420	2818780	If it's like a BeatMania game or something like that, then yeah, that's a little bit
2818780	2824980	more acceptable, because you can't play DDR on a DS.
2824980	2825980	It's just weird.
2825980	2831220	Although, although I did see a homebrew program, though, that could be a way that they could
2831220	2832700	do DDR on a DS.
2832700	2836700	It would just be, you know, with stylus strokes and stuff like that, and it looked really
2836700	2837700	cool.
2837700	2841380	But because it looked really cool, Konami would never do that.
2841380	2842660	Of course.
2842660	2847900	Alright, well, hey, speaking of some systems, there's still some love for the old systems
2847900	2848900	too.
2848900	2853500	In fact, systems so old that Victoria actually owns them, because she can afford them.
2853500	2859020	You are such a bitch, oh my god!
2859020	2860020	Shut up!
2860020	2861020	I love you.
2861020	2862020	Please don't.
2862020	2863020	Yes, I do.
2863020	2867980	PlayStation 2 reaches the 50 million sold mark in North America.
2867980	2873720	PlayStation 2 has actually hit that mark, 50 million, and I believe that is more than
2873720	2876780	any other system, if I'm not mistaken.
2876780	2878740	So it's a lot.
2878740	2879740	Wow.
2879740	2883540	Because they keep breaking, and you have to keep re-buying them.
2883540	2891240	So by the way, there is a note from John Kohler, the marketing head of Sony Computer Entertainment.
2891240	2894100	We don't intend on discarding the system any time soon.
2894100	2898060	Yeah, they still sell like hundreds of thousands of units each month, because they can't play
2898060	2899060	the games on a PS3.
2899060	2904580	They're going to release the PSI on April 4th for a price tag of $159.
2904580	2905580	Perhaps.
2905580	2910340	It would be cool if they shrunk down the PS2 even more, make it like the size of an old...
2910340	2911580	Like your finger or something.
2911580	2912580	Yes, the size of my finger.
2912580	2913580	That would be awesome.
2913580	2916140	Yeah, because I could put a DVD in my finger, dummy.
2916140	2917140	I could!
2917140	2918540	I could spin it around my finger, that would work.
2918540	2921000	You could put it in, it would just break.
2921000	2922000	Like a lot.
2922000	2923000	You're so weird.
2923000	2924000	You're weird.
2924000	2925000	Shut up.
2925000	2928180	Game Guru would like to point out, PS2 makes money, PS3 does not.
2928180	2929180	Yep.
2929180	2932380	But you know, people are saying the PS3 needs to come down in price, and then they might
2932380	2934140	actually sell some more units.
2934140	2935140	Who knows?
2935140	2936140	Too late.
2936140	2937140	Too little, too late.
2937140	2938140	Yeah, I think so.
2938140	2939140	It's just a little too late.
2939140	2944060	It's just, might as well give up this console generation, just, you know, work on the next
2944060	2945060	one.
2945060	2947340	I don't know.
2947340	2953980	So we talked a little bit before about the video download service that they have in Japan
2953980	2957700	for the Wii, which is kind of, I don't know.
2957700	2961460	It's very family friendly, I guess.
2961460	2966620	Maybe they have cartoons and other Japanese programming stuff on there.
2966620	2972780	Well, something similar may be coming to the US this year, actually.
2972780	2980460	And apparently, FujiSoft, the company behind it, was at CES and told Gamersight that they
2980460	2983980	were planning on bringing the WiiWare video service to the US.
2983980	2992300	It says, we can't quite tell at the moment, but if the negotiations are a success, maybe
2992300	2995500	within the year.
2995500	3001100	Which is cool, but you know, we still need some better storage on the Wii.
3001100	3005140	I know, I'm gonna be able to store all that video on my, you know, internal Wii drive
3005140	3008980	or the SD card it doesn't know how to read off of.
3008980	3010540	So what's that, Victoria?
3010540	3013460	I said, I can't work the Wii, I'm like retarded.
3013460	3015180	I've tried playing it.
3015180	3020500	You know what's funny is that the Wii is made for people to be able to understand very easily,
3020500	3021500	but you can't figure it out?
3021500	3023500	Well, I can, but I'm just not good at it.
3023500	3025780	I like having the little control in my hand.
3025780	3029100	Well, I guess it's kind of good if you're one of those people who moves the controller
3029100	3032220	to the left when you want your little person to go to the left, you know, like you're playing
3032220	3033980	Mario Brothers old school.
3033980	3038260	You know, just, jump right, right, right, yeah, no, I don't know.
3038260	3039260	Yeah, you do.
3039260	3040260	Yeah, exactly.
3040260	3043700	Yeah, but I fail, epically, at the Wii.
3043700	3045060	What games do you enjoy on Wii?
3045060	3049220	I like that Wario one where you have to go through, do the little movements, I don't
3049220	3050220	know what it's called.
3050220	3051220	WarioWare.
3051220	3052220	That one.
3052220	3056140	Yeah, that's like one of the only games I've ever played on the Wii, other than Guitar
3056140	3058620	Hero because my cousins have it on, so.
3058620	3060220	Alright, good times.
3060220	3062220	So you're a Wii-tard, is what you're basically saying.
3062220	3064220	Yes, I'm a Wii-tard, yeah, exactly.
3064220	3065220	There you go.
3065220	3066220	Alright.
3066220	3069380	Well, hey, if you want to get a Wii cheap, you might want to run over to Circuit City
3069380	3074060	because Circuit City has gone under, and you know, so many of these companies are going
3074060	3075980	under recently, it's kind of sad.
3075980	3080460	I almost feel like we need a theme song on the show for when companies go under.
3080460	3095300	So let me try reading the story to this music.
3095300	3103180	Circuit City has announced that they are going to be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, actually
3103180	3108180	no, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy already and closed 155 stores, that wasn't enough.
3108180	3115060	Now they are unable to find a buyer to keep themselves afloat, they are being liquidated.
3115060	3122140	So basically, sadly, and I apologize to any listeners we have who work for Circuit City
3122140	3127740	because this news has got to suck, and we really hope somebody else will come in and
3127740	3132500	buy up some of these old stores, but they are going under.
3132500	3135780	And from what I'm hearing from people who do work for them, that I know on like Live
3135780	3139900	Journal and stuff, apparently the company was horribly managed, and it's finally come
3139900	3140900	back to get them.
3140900	3146260	They kind of had an old business model too, I mean like, with places like Fry's and Best
3146260	3150780	Buy and stuff, Circuit City was just kind of the little guy, and they just can't keep
3150780	3151780	up.
3151780	3156100	And they kept building them next to Best Buy's, or Best Buy's kept building them next to Circuit
3156100	3160340	City, so like, you know, they kind of didn't have a chance.
3160340	3163380	So and here's the interesting thing, is of course the way liquidation sales usually work
3163380	3166100	is that, you know, they will be, by the way, it doesn't affect Canada.
3166100	3170500	Circuit City Canada is still going because it's not the US, so you don't have a US bankruptcy
3170500	3171500	thing.
3171500	3172500	So Circuit City Canada is still fine.
3172500	3177380	But Circuit City US, they're, you know, going under, and when a store liquidates, usually
3177380	3180260	they're going to have sales for the first week, 10% off.
3180260	3182900	And then the second week, 20% off, third week, 30% off.
3182900	3187060	Well here's the thing is that people are already snatching up the TVs, the Xboxes and all this
3187060	3189300	stuff, because they're like, OMG, 10% off.
3189300	3193260	Well, Circuit City was marking half this shit up to begin with, which is probably part of
3193260	3194700	the reason they're going under.
3194700	3196900	So you're really sadly not going to say much.
3196900	3201020	Actually they're doing some stuff 10, some stuff 20, and some stuff 30, all in the same
3201020	3202020	week, so.
3202020	3203020	Oh interesting.
3203020	3204020	I haven't been to the one here yet.
3204020	3205020	Did you check it out already?
3205020	3208500	Nathan went, that's where he was going to look for his RAM or whatever, so.
3208500	3209500	Oh okay, interesting.
3209500	3210500	Good luck with that.
3210500	3211500	I know.
3211500	3214140	So I was like, all the good stuff's going to be gone already, I'm sure it went this
3214140	3215140	weekend.
3215140	3216140	Probably.
3216140	3219940	So all that's going to be left is like DVD and CDs of bands you've never heard of, probably.
3219940	3224300	Yeah, we went over to Circuit City the other day to look at their, this was before I got
3224300	3226700	my new car stereo.
3226700	3229260	They actually had less stereos than Walmart did.
3229260	3234940	I mean, Walmart has a pretty pathetic car stereo section, I mean, I think Circuit City
3234940	3235940	had like eight.
3235940	3238620	I didn't know that Walmart had a car section, or car stereo.
3238620	3244300	Yeah, they're very, they're, they suck, you know, I was like, looking for a price for
3244300	3248380	one of them, and the woman's like, be on that shelf over here!
3248380	3249980	Just like, what the fuck?
3249980	3252980	Well they all just lost their jobs, I mean, they're fine.
3252980	3253980	No, I'm talking about Walmart.
3253980	3254980	Oh.
3254980	3256900	This woman's not going anywhere, she's a bitch, but yeah.
3256900	3259740	It's like Mrs. Crabtree, like, sit down!
3259740	3260740	Shut up!
3260740	3265180	The Circuit City people were back smoking or talking to each other or something like
3265180	3266300	that, they were nowhere to be found.
3266300	3269580	I always, see, here's the thing, I always liked shopping at Circuit City, actually.
3269580	3272860	I liked going to Circuit City to shop because it was never crowded, and there was never
3272860	3276140	any lines, because nobody was there.
3276140	3279820	I mean, honestly, I mean, I hate to be rude, but it was actually kind of a selling point
3279820	3280820	to me.
3280820	3284420	Remember that one time, back when they were selling Weez and stuff, and we went, we drove
3284420	3287180	by the Circuit City, and there was like, no one there?
3287180	3291200	Yeah, it was the night the Weez came out, and Best Buy had a line like, going around
3291200	3294300	the block, remember we went out, like, when the Weez came out, we were giving out, what
3294300	3299220	was it, orange soda, and so we were trying to sell our show to locals, and so we did
3299220	3302740	that, went to Best Buy, and then Circuit City had like, five people.
3302740	3305020	Wow, that's great.
3305020	3306020	Poor guys.
3306020	3310020	I feel bad, you know there's someone who listens to this show who works for Circuit City, who
3310020	3314020	just loves their job, who's a little pissed, that we're riffing on them a little bit, and
3314020	3315220	it does suck, you know.
3315220	3319460	You know, I have friends, actually, from school that worked at Circuit City, but they kind
3319460	3323780	of knew it was coming, you know, they've been looking for a little while for another job,
3323780	3327300	you know, like, they had something lined up, they knew this was gonna happen, so, I mean,
3327300	3329780	it sucks, but, they prepared, you know, they've known.
3329780	3335020	Well, I hope that's the case, so, good luck to all those that were impacted, and unless
3335020	3338580	you were part of the reason Circuit City went under, like, you're one of these upper managements
3338580	3343380	that didn't know what you were doing, then, well, sucks, doesn't it?
3343380	3350540	Alright, well, apparently there was a story about this dog that was as dead as Circuit
3350540	3353300	City for at least a moment.
3353300	3354300	Wow.
3354300	3361500	Apparently a woman in Michigan nearly killed her dog when she accidentally struck it on
3361500	3363540	the temple with a Wii remote.
3363540	3369740	Yes, she was busy doing some Wii Sports bowling, didn't have the wrist strap on or something
3369740	3375740	like that, and the Wii remote went straight and hit the dog in the temple, killing him
3375740	3376740	instantly.
3376740	3379300	Poor doggy!
3379300	3387340	But then, luckily though, the dog, Ozzy, was not moving and stuff, so they called a neighbor
3387340	3393460	who apparently had some veterinary training, and she was able to revive the dog using mouth-to-mouth.
3393460	3398980	But the dog had to be taken to the real vet, where, you know, apparently it had some severe
3398980	3404540	brain swelling due to cardiac arrest, but the dog, you know, apparently is fine now.
3404540	3405540	Yay!
3405540	3408060	Wait, she had to kiss the dog on the mouth?
3408060	3409060	Not kiss.
3409060	3410060	Yeah, full-on, like, mouth-to-mouth.
3410060	3414020	No, no, it's not mouth-to-mouth, it's actually nose.
3414020	3416020	You have to blow down the dog's nose.
3416020	3417020	Oh.
3417020	3418020	Okay, well.
3418020	3419940	I love dogs, but not that much.
3419940	3420940	Aww.
3420940	3424300	Hey, if my cat was dying, I'd do that.
3424300	3425700	Fuck that, it's my cat.
3425700	3426700	Fuck that.
3426700	3427700	It's a family.
3427700	3428700	It's got these boogers on its nose.
3428700	3429700	I'm gonna...
3429700	3430700	No, I understand.
3430700	3431700	Yeah, that'd be like, I'm happy.
3431700	3435780	Oh, Irene's dying, but her breath kinda smells...
3435780	3439220	Hey, I wouldn't blame you, Matt.
3439220	3441460	I think I'm just gonna let her die, you know?
3441460	3444340	Rob, I'm never gonna give you, like, mouth-to-nose.
3444340	3447340	I mean, you're dear to me, but that's nasty, and I wouldn't...
3447340	3449540	Just let me die, right?
3449540	3451540	Maybe your mouth, but your nose.
3451540	3452540	Hell nah.
3452540	3453540	Aww, the dog is...
3453540	3455980	And then when I wake up, I'd be like, ew, why are you trying to kiss me, pervert?
3455980	3459420	And then I'd throw a Wii Mode at your temple, and like, hope you die.
3459420	3460780	That's wrong, you shouldn't joke about that.
3460780	3461780	You don't know.
3461780	3462780	I know, it's a cute puppy.
3462780	3463780	Alright.
3463780	3464780	Aww.
3464780	3468620	And then later, pretty soon, there will be video of these Wii accidents, as if there
3468620	3472940	aren't enough already, of people destroying their TVs and stuff, showing up on YouTube.
3472940	3477100	And the ironic thing now is that it'll be much easier to watch someone break their Wii
3477100	3478100	on a Wii.
3478100	3481900	And the reason why I say that is that, you know, who doesn't love to watch YouTube?
3481900	3485260	Like when you're having a party, and somebody says, hey, did you see that thing on Saturday
3485260	3486260	Night Live?
3486260	3488940	Hurry up, let's look it up on YouTube before they remove it.
3488940	3492220	You run onto YouTube, right, and you get it on the TV, but unfortunately, YouTube kinda
3492220	3494860	sucks to look at on the TV, right?
3494860	3501540	Well now, YouTube has launched a special site, it's at www.youtube.com slash TV, and if you
3501540	3506820	go to the site on your PlayStation 3 or your Nintendo Wii, it's a new site that's like,
3506820	3508540	optimized for those.
3508540	3515140	So it's much easier to browse YouTube, and yeah, and I've heard great things about it.
3515140	3519940	So props to YouTube for finally, a year later, getting their site optimized to use on the
3519940	3520940	TV.
3520940	3521940	That's great.
3521940	3526580	I was gonna say, though, that there is a video, I guess it's a news report about the dog that
3526580	3531260	died on YouTube, so it's, if you search for a woman's, they have a, what is it, a dog
3531260	3533180	killed by Wii Remote, and then you can-
3533180	3534580	Wait, but the dog actually lived!
3534580	3535580	The dog lived!
3535580	3536580	He was only dead for five minutes.
3536580	3537700	Okay, cause I don't, you know, it's-
3537700	3539180	Which makes him a zombie!
3539180	3541700	Wait, he was dead for five minutes?
3541700	3542700	Yes.
3542700	3546500	I thought you could start getting, like, brain damage after, like, three or four minutes.
3546500	3547500	Doctor dumb.
3547500	3548500	So, you know-
3548500	3549700	Like, what are they gonna damage?
3549700	3550700	You know?
3550700	3551980	I guess that's true.
3551980	3552980	Aww, that's what makes them adorable, though.
3552980	3556900	And it's one of those dogs, I forget what they call it, it's not a collie, but it's,
3556900	3557900	um-
3557900	3558900	It's like Lassie?
3558900	3560900	It's like a miniature collie or something, what do they call it?
3560900	3562500	Yeah, it's like a mini Lassie.
3562500	3564140	She killed Lassie!
3564140	3565140	Yeah.
3565140	3566580	Border collie?
3566580	3567580	Is the normal thing?
3567580	3568580	Right?
3568580	3573100	I don't know if it's a border collie, it's like a miniature collie, I don't know.
3573100	3575100	Cause border collies are a little bit bigger.
3575100	3576100	Man, I don't know.
3576100	3577100	They're, like, Lassie-sized.
3577100	3578100	Yeah.
3578100	3580100	That's what Lassie is, a border collie.
3580100	3581100	Anyways.
3581100	3582100	Sorry.
3582100	3585380	Distracted by the dog.
3585380	3594140	So, there's some other interesting stuff, a little bit more positive, I guess, for Nintendo.
3594140	3602660	There's a new patent that shows Nintendo is possibly working on a motion-sensing DS card.
3602660	3607340	Perhaps, you know, something that was similar to, like, what they had for the Game Boy Advance,
3607340	3608620	you know, for different games.
3608620	3610700	I think one of the Warioware games had it.
3610700	3614860	But it's a DS direction-sensing card.
3614860	3616860	Hmm.
3616860	3621260	No word on what it's gonna be used for, but it's something that has built-in direction
3621260	3622260	and motion tracking.
3622260	3625980	So, I can get my iPhone's games ported to my DS, because that's what I see happening
3625980	3629980	when this comes out, is that now we'll just get ports of iPhone games on the DS.
3629980	3630980	Yeah.
3630980	3631980	With that whole little TILTI thing.
3631980	3634020	I can get Silent Hill The Escape on my DS.
3634020	3635020	Wouldn't that be fabulous?
3635020	3636020	Wow.
3636020	3637020	That's exactly what you wanted, huh?
3637020	3638020	I know.
3638020	3639020	Okay.
3639020	3641580	No, they didn't do a Silent Hill game on the DS.
3641580	3644220	They did a Resident Evil game on the DS, and that was not very good.
3644220	3649420	Was there, like, a play novel or something that was on the DS?
3649420	3653060	But a motion-sensing card, I mean, those DS cards are not exactly that big, so that's
3653060	3654060	pretty impressive.
3654060	3658980	I would think that they would just do, well, the actual chips that do the motion-sensing
3658980	3661900	are really super tiny, so it could be done.
3661900	3667940	It's just, I don't know, and really, I mean, you can have those things kind of hang out
3667940	3673180	of the slot a little bit, you know, because I remember with, like, the WarioWare one that
3673180	3674660	they had, it was pretty big.
3674660	3679700	I mean, I guess technology was a little bit older then, but, you know, the card itself
3679700	3685260	was huge compared to what normal Game Boy Advance, you know, cards look like, so.
3685260	3686260	Very interesting.
3686260	3687260	I like this comment in chat.
3687260	3689860	Sy says this in chat room, what the hell?
3689860	3691020	Why not have that in the DSi?
3691020	3694220	A new system is just out and already an add-on that should be built in.
3694220	3695820	Yeah, exactly.
3695820	3700140	Just like the Wii Motion Plus, something that should have been done in the first place.
3700140	3702300	Because Nintendo really cares about its customer base.
3702300	3705020	Damn it, we're not getting into that argument.
3705020	3711500	Well, alright, I guess we'll see what comes to this, or what possible game they could
3711500	3713740	be making with this, who knows, but, uh.
3713740	3715880	It's gonna suck, whatever it is, I'm sure.
3715880	3720380	It's gonna be like Wii Sports for the DS or something, can you imagine that?
3720380	3725380	Wii Bowling, people throwing their DSs, oh no, I broke my DS, like, guess I gotta go
3725380	3730820	buy a new DSi, I see conspiracy here.
3730820	3736060	Well this will be an interesting game when it comes out, Final Fantasy Legend 2 is being
3736060	3738220	remade for the DS.
3738220	3741100	Wait, is that the Game Boy one?
3741100	3742100	Yes.
3742100	3744660	Okay, the one that's not really like Final Fantasy, the one that's more like part of
3744660	3745660	the Saga series?
3745660	3751700	You got it, it was actually Saga 2, Hiho Densetsu, and that was Final Fantasy Legend
3751700	3752700	here.
3752700	3753700	I love when you pronounce Japanese.
3753700	3754700	Shut up.
3754700	3760340	But yeah, it's getting the full 3D little views and things, kind of like Final Fantasy
3760340	3763420	4 and the Dragon Quest games have had, so that's being released here.
3763420	3769660	Awesome, I actually think I still have Final Fantasy Legend 2 or 3 on my old Game Boy cartridge.
3769660	3774020	Yeah, and in this Japanese magazine, they are definitely selling it as Saga 2, so.
3774020	3775020	Awesome.
3775020	3776020	Yeah.
3776020	3778020	I liked the Saga series, I'm like the only person in the world.
3778020	3781620	Maybe they'll call it Saga when it comes out over here instead of Final Fantasy.
3781620	3786620	Um, maybe, because it would be very weird to have Final Fantasy Legend 2 come out over
3786620	3789980	here, you know, and it would be kind of like, well, whatever happened to the first two,
3789980	3792060	because who remembers that far back of the Game Boy, you know?
3792060	3793940	Well, yeah, I guess that's true.
3793940	3797020	Let's just hope that they never do a Mystic Quest remake.
3797020	3799500	I somehow don't see that happening.
3799500	3801620	Mystic Quest wasn't terrible.
3801620	3802620	But it wasn't good.
3802620	3806220	Yeah, I'll just leave it at that, it wasn't terrible.
3806220	3807220	Anyhow.
3807220	3808220	Anyways.
3808220	3809220	That's it.
3809220	3815460	So, yes, it figures that the homebrew community, of course, is doing something that Nintendo
3815460	3819060	isn't doing on their own.
3819060	3823860	A new device has come out, Matrix Wii Z.
3823860	3832740	It's being prototyped right now, but it basically is sort of a mod chip that plugs into your
3832740	3833740	Wii system.
3833740	3837660	There's actually no modification really being done to the hardware, it's just a plug mod,
3837660	3842780	so you unhook one of the ribbon cables, plug it into this mod device, and then plug another
3842780	3846700	ribbon cable into where you'd normally plug the original ribbon cable.
3846700	3853020	It sounds kind of complicated, but what this actually does, it will allow you to not only
3853020	3860100	do the same stuff as a normal mod chip, but it has a connector for a SATA external HD
3860100	3867380	or a hard drive, so you can attach an external hard drive to the Wii.
3867380	3868380	And so I can put...
3868380	3872440	So, well, they say that you can put ISO's on there and stuff like that and actually
3872440	3874340	run pirated games for them, but you can...
3874340	3875940	Oh, I wouldn't want to encourage people to do that.
3875940	3876940	No, no, no.
3876940	3881540	You can also, it will, the system itself will look at it like it's part of the actual storage
3881540	3885960	on the device, so you can, you know, use it for storing games.
3885960	3892420	But this, yeah, you can actually store ISO's and stuff, so.
3892420	3893660	Rob just tried to rape me.
3893660	3896920	Well, you were falling asleep, so I went over there to give you a lap dance, and I was getting
3896920	3897920	a cookie.
3897920	3898920	So, because...
3898920	3900140	I'm frightened.
3900140	3903740	All I hear is blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah, and I'm not hearing...
3903740	3906260	You shoved your dong in her face, okay?
3906260	3908020	I did not shove my dong in her face.
3908020	3911620	You were like, how many licks does it take, and you were like, I'm waving your dong in
3911620	3912620	her face.
3912620	3914380	No, I waved a snickerdoodle in her face.
3914380	3916860	Oh, yeah, that's what they call it, your snickerdoodle.
3916860	3919580	And that's why you thrusted your nut sack in my face.
3919580	3921200	I was like, oh my gooses.
3921200	3923980	You make it sound like I'm not wearing pants or something.
3923980	3924980	You're not.
3924980	3932020	But yeah, it's basically, this device will allow super fast loading of ISOs in homebrew,
3932020	3933020	so.
3933020	3934020	Yeah.
3934020	3935020	Awesome.
3935020	3936020	Hooray.
3936020	3937060	I'm sorry, I was just hearing blah, blah, blah, wee, blah, blah, blah, a system that
3937060	3941460	doesn't have any games out on it I care about, blah, blah, blah.
3941460	3943020	But Rob, what?
3943020	3946380	They're doing, you know, the new play control...
3946380	3951260	Yes, that's a title that they stuck with, you know, for instead of play on the Wii,
3951260	3957420	you know, new play control, Mario, was it Mario Power Tennis and the new play control
3957420	3958420	Pikmin.
3958420	3960100	Aren't you excited about those?
3960100	3963260	I mean, those games are totally new and not ever been out on the GameCube.
3963260	3965140	Oh, wait, no, they have.
3965140	3966140	Sad.
3966140	3970220	Irene, care to comment on anything?
3970220	3971900	What Wii games are you looking forward to, Irene?
3971900	3974020	I'm dying to know.
3974020	3977980	You know, things and stuff.
3977980	3981180	That's probably actually a Wii game that's coming out with things and stuff.
3981180	3982180	Things and stuff.
3982180	3985060	When it's a collection of mini games.
3985060	3986060	That's what it is.
3986060	3987060	Yay.
3987060	3988060	Things and stuff.
3988060	3991100	Sounds like a dream game to me.
3991100	3992100	You too?
3992100	3993100	Oh my gosh.
3993100	3994100	Shut up.
3994100	3996420	Is that coming out on the Wii in April?
3996420	3997420	On April 4th.
3997420	3998420	Can't wait.
3998420	3999420	Things and stuff.
3999420	4000420	Yeah.
4000420	4001420	Shut up.
4001420	4004340	They said I'll wave my dong in people's faces, okay?
4004340	4006380	That's one of the mini games, actually, in things and stuff.
4006380	4007380	No, I'm never buying that game then.
4007380	4009940	You take your thingy and wave it in Victoria's face.
4009940	4011900	Yeah, take your stuff.
4011900	4012900	Yup.
4012900	4017620	Well, hey, whatever Nintendo's doing, it's working, because do you know how many Wiis
4017620	4020460	they sold in December?
4020460	4025160	Five million consoles sold by Nintendo in December, although that's a little bit...
4025160	4026540	It's actually not Wiis alone.
4026540	4031580	It was actually the DS sold three million, and the Wii sold two million, so you put it
4031580	4034780	together, they sold five million systems that Nintendo moved.
4034780	4037780	That's a lot of dead Collies.
4037780	4039980	Matt!
4039980	4046220	Matt's gonna wipe out the Collie species off this plant.
4046220	4047220	You are terrible.
4047220	4049660	Lassie will be just a memory.
4049660	4052700	Well, she is, but she's dead.
4052700	4055700	Look, that's okay.
4055700	4059500	And Timmy will be stuck in the well forever.
4059500	4062300	Where's Jamie here to yell at you?
4062300	4066660	But look, the reason why this is newsworthy is December, hello, Christmas.
4066660	4069540	So these are the numbers that were going into the Christmas and what ended up under people's
4069540	4070540	trees.
4070540	4078980	So, yeah, three million DS's, two million Wiis, one and a half about million Xbox 360s,
4078980	4083740	one million PSPs, three quarters of a million PS3s.
4083740	4084740	Big surprise.
4084740	4088020	And not even half a million PS2s, but still, you know, going in there.
4088020	4092900	Yeah, it's kind of an old system, so that's actually pretty good.
4092900	4096900	Dark Tetsuya says OLR's gonna get an angry email from PETA.
4096900	4101740	I hope we do, because Jamie would have to read it.
4101740	4105260	And Jamie is very opinionated when it comes to PETA.
4105260	4110140	So I would actually, I welcome them to write the email, please, by all means.
4110140	4111140	Come on the show.
4111140	4116580	In fact, I totally encourage people going out and murdering animals with Wii remotes
4116580	4117580	and controllers.
4117580	4120340	And why stop at the Wii?
4120340	4123180	I mean, hell, look at the original Xbox controller.
4123180	4129020	That thing is like a blunt object of death.
4129020	4131020	Try dropping an original Xbox on a dog?
4131020	4132020	God, I hope the kids know he's not serious.
4132020	4133020	Oh, they'd never survive.
4133020	4134020	Please, please.
4134020	4135020	You can take out like three dogs with that thing.
4135020	4136020	Oh, God, am I really here right now?
4136020	4137020	Yeah, three like great veins with those.
4137020	4138020	Am I really here?
4138020	4139180	Like, Christ.
4139180	4141180	If we get sued, I don't want any part of this.
4141180	4142180	You know, you're gonna get sued by.
4142180	4143180	I'm distancing myself.
4143180	4144180	I love PETA or some shit.
4144180	4148460	Did you ever see Mythbusters where they were, there was the myth where they dropped the
4148460	4151780	frozen turkey on a dog and to see what kind of damage it would do.
4151780	4156380	So they made this like analog dog and they dropped the turkey on it and it just shattered
4156380	4157380	the dog.
4157380	4159260	So can you imagine what happened with an Xbox?
4159260	4161100	I mean, those things are heavy.
4161100	4163020	Oh, oh, frozen Xbox.
4163020	4164020	Oh, my God.
4164020	4165020	Frozen Xbox.
4165020	4170620	You drop it and then the world like breaks in half because it's so way out of this show.
4170620	4172620	It's not ridiculous.
4172620	4173620	Could happen.
4173620	4174620	Yes.
4174620	4175620	I do.
4175620	4176620	You know what?
4176620	4178860	It's the Wii Fit Balance Board.
4178860	4183220	I mean, that thing is pretty big and it does wake a bit.
4183220	4184220	It's pretty sizable.
4184220	4185220	It's pretty sizable.
4185220	4186220	You could.
4186220	4187780	I'm not advocating anything.
4187780	4190180	I'm just saying it could happen.
4190180	4192060	Matt's the one who's saying you should kill animals.
4192060	4195380	I'd like to drop a frozen turkey on Miley Cyrus.
4195380	4198460	I don't know about anybody else out there.
4198460	4199460	Kill that bitch.
4199460	4200700	She gets to fucking die.
4200700	4203220	Hey, have you seen the trailer for the new movie?
4203220	4204220	No.
4204220	4205220	Tyra Banks is in it.
4205220	4207060	Oh, shit.
4207060	4208060	I might have to go.
4208060	4211660	See, that's what I would, if I had a radio show, I'd be all about celebrities and all
4211660	4212660	that shit.
4212660	4213660	Me and Rob talked about it for a while.
4213660	4214660	This is a possibility.
4214660	4215660	This is a kind of possibility.
4215660	4216660	I think it'd be pretty fierce.
4216660	4217660	Maybe.
4217660	4218660	Yep.
4218660	4219660	All right.
4219660	4220660	I don't know.
4220660	4221660	That's enough of me saying stuff that's...
4221660	4222660	Yes, please.
4222660	4223660	Can we get some release dates for God's sake?
4223660	4224660	No.
4224660	4225660	I guess.
4225660	4226660	Whatever.
4226660	4227660	Oh, perfect.
4227660	4230460	Anyways, so this week we've got a few things coming out.
4230460	4231460	I mean, it's January.
4231460	4232460	It's pretty slow still.
4232460	4234340	There's some good stuff.
4234340	4236820	Star Ocean Second Evolution for the PSP.
4236820	4237940	That's going to be a pretty good game.
4237940	4243900	You know, some of these Square Enix PSP games are doing very well, so that one's awesome.
4243900	4245700	Jumble Madness for the DS.
4245700	4249020	It's a bunch of word puzzles and stuff, hooray.
4249020	4251140	Big Bang Mini on the DS.
4251140	4254260	We actually played this, I think, at South Peaks booth.
4254260	4255260	Pretty fun.
4255260	4261180	It's kind of a little bit like, what was it, Fanavision and a space shooter type game.
4261180	4262180	Yeah, it was neat.
4262180	4263180	Yeah.
4263180	4265060	Something that needs a die and a fire.
4265060	4266060	Imagine Fashion Party.
4266060	4267060	Yeah, no thanks.
4267060	4268060	Let's see here.
4268060	4274060	So these are the games I'm going to get for Victoria, because she loved this type of game.
4274060	4275060	Imagine Fashion...
4275060	4276060	Okay, look.
4276060	4277060	No, no, no, no.
4277060	4279000	This bitch right here.
4279000	4282700	We were walking through Walmart, and we got to the section with the top model clothes,
4282700	4285020	and she was like, oh, top model.
4285020	4288900	I got a top model tank top for Christmas, so bite me.
4288900	4294540	Can you imagine the possibilities with that game?
4294540	4297300	Shut up.
4297300	4298300	Let's see here.
4298300	4304140	I was going to say, also, the Ultimate Shooting Collection on the Wii.
4304140	4306980	It's three Japanese arcade shooter games.
4306980	4307980	They're actually pretty good.
4307980	4309380	I'm trying to remember what was in it.
4309380	4316660	It was Cororius, Radio Allergy, and I don't remember the last one that was in there.
4316660	4321140	But really, bullet hell shooter games.
4321140	4322140	Oh.
4322140	4323140	Okay.
4323140	4325020	That's cool.
4325020	4327060	Wonder World Amusement Park for the DS.
4327060	4329860	A bunch of mini games on there.
4329860	4334460	Artonaliko 2, the Melody of Melofechesa, I guess.
4334460	4336640	I don't know.
4336640	4337640	Was that a Disney villain?
4337640	4338640	Melofechesa?
4338640	4339640	No, I'm sorry.
4339640	4340640	I totally butchered that.
4340640	4343860	The Melody of Metapholycia, I guess.
4343860	4344860	I don't know.
4344860	4346860	Felicio?
4346860	4348860	I'm so done with that.
4348860	4349860	Okay.
4349860	4350860	With some extra crap.
4350860	4351860	It's on the PS2.
4351860	4352860	Wow.
4352860	4356660	The subtitle to that, none of which I just said.
4356660	4358660	So there you go.
4358660	4365940	Anyways, Skate 2 is coming out on PS3 and 360 this week as well.
4365940	4372220	And let's see here, tying in perfectly what we were talking about just before I started
4372220	4374100	talking about release dates.
4374100	4379700	Sim animals, another sim game where you get to control the wonders of nature.
4379700	4384860	In fact, they actually have this hand, which is the pointer, and you can poke badgers and
4384860	4386680	stuff and they will attack your hand.
4386680	4387680	It's awesome.
4387680	4392880	Badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger.
4392880	4394580	Is it football or mushroom?
4394580	4395580	Mushroom.
4395580	4396580	It's football, isn't it?
4396580	4397580	I don't know.
4397580	4398580	I think it's mushroom.
4398580	4399580	It's mushroom.
4399580	4400580	Yeah, it's okay.
4400580	4401740	But that'll be out on the Wii and the DS.
4401740	4403280	So awesome.
4403280	4407300	Can you simulate, you know, dropping stuff on your animals?
4407300	4408620	You can throw animals.
4408620	4414360	I saw them shaking a squirrel violently, so I'm sure you can throw rocks at them.
4414360	4415360	Why would you shake a squirrel?
4415360	4416600	Or maybe feed them to other things.
4416600	4418280	Are you done with US release dates?
4418280	4421720	We need to take, like, the bear in that game and just feed it all sorts of animals, and
4421720	4423840	they'll become rabid and just eat things.
4423840	4424840	I know.
4424840	4425840	Very rare bear.
4425840	4428160	I'm trying my hardest, okay?
4428160	4431800	It just never works.
4431800	4434200	Moving on to the UK and the release dates over there.
4434200	4435200	We need a British accent.
4435200	4436200	British accent.
4436200	4437600	Oh, you want me to do it in British accent?
4437600	4438840	I do, yes please.
4438840	4442280	Well, I really annoy everybody overseas when I talk like this.
4442280	4444280	It's a really bad British accent, I'll give you that.
4444280	4445280	It's a really bad one.
4445280	4447280	Do you want to read these in British accent, Victoria?
4447280	4448280	No, I don't want to read them in British accent.
4448280	4449280	Why not?
4449280	4450280	Because.
4450280	4451280	I think you should.
4451280	4452280	Why?
4452280	4453280	Well, do you want me to get you some tea and some crumpets?
4453280	4454280	Put you in the mood?
4454280	4455280	I don't like tea and crumpets.
4455280	4456280	Okay.
4456280	4457280	Okay, knock it off.
4457280	4460880	If you're going to talk in an accent, talk like you're from New York, alright?
4460880	4461880	Don't be such a wanker.
4461880	4462880	Alright.
4462880	4463880	You're a wanker.
4463880	4470800	On the 20th, I'm going to get so much hate mail this week.
4470800	4472800	On the 23rd.
4472800	4476200	British accent.
4476200	4487280	On the 23rd, Football Manager Live is coming to the PC and Neopets Puzzle Adventures coming
4487280	4490920	out as well on the DS and the PFC and the Wii.
4490920	4496480	I don't know who's bloody playing Neopets, but somebody is for sure.
4496480	4504640	On Skate 2 comes out for the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360.
4504640	4511280	I'm not doing a Japanese accent for the Japanese releases.
4511280	4512280	Stop it.
4512280	4513280	Left 4 Dead comes out.
4513280	4518520	The Japanese version on January 22nd on the Xbox 360.
4518520	4520040	The Playstation 3.
4520040	4522600	See, she can do that because she's actually Asian.
4522600	4525840	I do it and I'm a racist.
4525840	4529960	Well you are.
4529960	4537600	Playstation 3, Prince of Persia, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw, and Juice 2 all getting releases
4537600	4541520	in Japan.
4541520	4549960	And on the Nintendo Wii, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party, Fragile, Sayonara, Suki no Haikayo,
4549960	4554080	Suzumiya Harui no Gekidou comes out as well.
4554080	4555080	What?
4555080	4556080	You want to read them?
4556080	4557080	No.
4557080	4558080	You think you can do better?
4558080	4559080	Probably.
4559080	4561680	I think anybody could do better.
4561680	4563680	I'm sorry.
4563680	4565360	Playstation 2.
4565360	4570800	Some price reductions for Destroy All Humans and Juice 2.
4570800	4576640	On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer comes out as well as Rayman what?
4576640	4583080	When you said that, you said Destroy All Humans and Juice 2, but I thought you said Juice
4583080	4584080	2.
4584080	4588480	It sounded like Destroy All Humans and Juice 2.
4588480	4591720	I'm like, but they're humans too.
4591720	4597080	You know, I don't even think that would be acceptable in Japan, let alone here.
4597080	4600920	I know they get away with some pretty crazy stuff, but not that.
4600920	4602240	That was awful.
4602240	4603880	Man, our show has really gone downhill.
4603880	4604880	It has.
4604880	4609480	We lose Jamie and seriously, it just goes to shit.
4609480	4612320	It's Rob's fault because he can't do a good British accent.
4612320	4616400	I know, my British accent single-handedly ruined the show.
4616400	4625040	On the Nintendo DS, Monster Racer, Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party, Te Guato DS Series
4625040	4628320	1, Tetsudo Data File.
4628320	4630240	What the hell that is.
4630240	4634640	But a game called Zubo is coming out in Japan, I bet that's pretty awesome.
4634640	4635640	So there you go.
4635640	4636640	Wow.
4636640	4637640	Zubo?
4637640	4638640	Mm-hmm.
4638640	4642920	I think that's a music game that's from EA.
4642920	4646920	They look like crap.
4646920	4652920	And on the Sony PSP, we have Patapon 2 comes out.
4652920	4656520	At least the Chinese version comes out in other Asian territories.
4656520	4658400	Ratchet and Clank gets a price reduction.
4658400	4666400	Looks like the only new game, Hokuto no Ken Rao Gaiden, Ten no Haoa comes out.
4666400	4667400	That's what it's called.
4667400	4668400	Totally.
4668400	4669480	Sort of.
4669480	4674240	It's a fighting game coming out on the PSP.
4674240	4675240	There you go.
4675240	4676240	Good times.
4676240	4678280	There's your Japanese releases.
4678280	4679280	Let's move on with the news.
4679280	4680280	I need a break.
4680280	4681280	Oh, those were Japanese?
4681280	4682280	We need to get to...
4682280	4683280	We need to get to the end of the par day.
4683280	4685720	I need to go flush my head down the toilet.
4685720	4686720	Alright.
4686720	4691880	Well, there's lots of download content coming to our music games here.
4691880	4699200	Starting off with Guitar Hero World Tour, they're getting a Travis Barker track pack.
4699200	4709040	And featured in there will be What's My Age Again by Blink-182, Lo, the Travis Barker
4709040	4720560	remix by Flo Rida, featuring T-Pain, and Looks Like a Lycanthrope by Plus44.
4720560	4729680	And that'll be available for 160 Microsoft points per track, or 440 for the entire bundle.
4729680	4731680	And no word on what the real money is.
4731680	4737480	I think, what is it, 160 is two bucks per.
4737480	4743120	And let's see, Rock Band is getting some interesting stuff.
4743120	4751400	Steve Miller, there's gonna be a Steve Miller Band 3-pack with Space Cowboy, Take the Money
4751400	4753440	and Run, and The Joker.
4753440	4758920	All of those will be available for 160 Microsoft points each, or $2.
4758920	4763560	And the pack will run you 440 Microsoft points, or $5.49.
4763560	4770880	And then the individual songs, you'll be getting I Stand Alone by Godsmack, Feed the Tree by
4770880	4777360	Belly, Wind Me Up by Ghost Hounds, Typical by Mute Math, and Warzone by Rob Zombie.
4777360	4781120	And if I remember correctly, I think Warzone says new single.
4781120	4782320	And all those will be available for...
4782320	4783320	Where's Dragula?
4783320	4784320	That song's awesome.
4784320	4786040	And I wanna play that on Rock Band.
4786040	4787040	Well that's...
4787040	4788760	It's back in the 90s, Rob.
4788760	4791280	Shut up, I hate you.
4791280	4792280	Anything.
4792280	4798080	Warzone wasn't that good from what I remember, I actually bought that.
4798080	4800600	So it was okay.
4800600	4802000	Not worth the single though.
4802000	4803720	It's a shame.
4803720	4804720	Yes.
4804720	4811240	Finally, Lips, the karaoke game, has some stuff coming out for the rest of this month.
4811240	4819360	Available, actually came out earlier this week, When I Grow Up by the Pussycat Dolls.
4819360	4825360	You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling by the Righteous Brothers, and Erased Rewind by the Carnagans.
4825360	4827200	Those all came out on the 16th.
4827200	4830120	I love that song.
4830120	4837160	Next week, we've got, let's see, on the 23rd here, Hate That I Love You by Rihanna featuring
4837160	4843280	Neo, and Thanks for the Memories by Fall Out Boy.
4843280	4846200	Yes, they're so hip that they don't use vowels in their...
4846200	4849480	We need to have Victoria just sing these songs as Loki reads them.
4849480	4850480	Yes, awesome.
4850480	4851960	I'm doing it anyway.
4851960	4855120	And then finally, Look What You've Done by Jet.
4855120	4858400	I don't know that one.
4858400	4861120	Look What You've Done, no I don't think that's it.
4861120	4868720	Alright, and then finally on January 30th, Sunday Morning by Maroon 5, Take a Bow by
4868720	4872840	Rihanna, and Water Runs Dry by Boyz II Men.
4872840	4879880	Wow, what is up with these random old songs like Belly Feed the Tree, like oh man, I was
4879880	4884720	so glad that made a comeback, and then like Boyz II Men, one of their songs that was not
4884720	4888880	even all that popular, like wow, okay, I guess.
4888880	4891600	Some comments from chat I gotta read.
4891600	4895160	Retertainment says, Why pay for tracks from Lips when I can steal them from Bittorrent
4895160	4896160	sites?
4896160	4897280	Plug in my iPod and play them for free.
4897280	4904320	Because it's not quite the same, and I think these actually come with the videos and stuff.
4904320	4908560	Leo Shen says, Where the fuck is my love fool and my favorite game?
4908560	4912400	Love Fools in Sing Star, for whatever it's worth, and it has the original video, not
4912400	4913800	the one they did in the US.
4913800	4914800	It's like the old school one.
4914800	4915800	I like your Race and Rewind.
4915800	4916800	That's a good song.
4916800	4917800	I do too.
4917800	4920200	I like my favorite game too, and I don't know what a good karaoke song that would be.
4920200	4925280	That's more of a, that other series, the racing series had that in one of their ads.
4925280	4926280	Gran Turismo?
4926280	4927280	Yeah.
4927280	4928280	Two.
4928280	4929280	My favorite game was like in the commercial?
4929280	4930280	It was, yeah.
4930280	4932280	It was a song in the game, wasn't it?
4932280	4933280	Mm-hmm.
4933280	4934280	Yeah.
4934280	4935280	Alright.
4935280	4939400	My favorite game was also, I think, one of the Euro DDR games.
4939400	4940400	Well speaking of...
4940400	4943000	I don't know, I could be completely wrong on that, but that's a guess.
4943000	4947320	Speaking of awesome music games, this news has me very, very happy.
4947320	4954240	The Harmonics CEO Alex Rigopoulos was interviewed with Ars Technica recently, and he has basically
4954240	4956720	professed his love for Amplitude.
4956720	4957720	You might remember that game.
4957720	4961840	Harmonics, these are the games they did before Guitar Hero, Amplitude and Frequency.
4961840	4966480	Well, he was basically confirming that he does want to eventually revive the series.
4966480	4967480	Yay!
4967480	4968480	Excited!
4968480	4969480	That'd be awesome.
4969480	4972120	So the only problem is Sony actually owns that property.
4972120	4974400	Harmonics developed it, I guess, for Sony.
4974400	4976200	So you ain't gonna see this on Xbox.
4976200	4979840	It would probably be like a PlayStation Network type game.
4979840	4981680	But hell, I don't mind.
4981680	4985800	I would love to see this game make a comeback because, you know, there's certain songs that
4985800	4987160	you can only get in these types of games.
4987160	4989280	You're not gonna get in like a rock band type game.
4989280	4990920	So I am definitely for this.
4990920	4991920	I hope...
4991920	4992920	I hope they do it.
4992920	4998560	They really need to like, revive some of those older rhythm games, like from the 90s and
4998560	4999560	early 2000s.
4999560	5002480	Like Guitar Freaks, and then they'll make a game called Rock...
5002480	5003480	Oh.
5003480	5006840	GS68 says, did Harmonics also do Karaoke Revolution with Konami?
5006840	5007840	They did.
5007840	5008840	They did.
5008840	5010120	They developed the first couple versions.
5010120	5013880	And then, by the time I think they got to like, Karaoke Country, I think finally Harmonics
5013880	5014880	split off.
5014880	5015880	And Konami did it themselves.
5015880	5018840	Harmonics is like, okay, we're not doing Country, fuck that.
5018840	5019840	Something like that, yeah.
5019840	5020840	Just kidding.
5020840	5022440	That's exactly how it went down.
5022440	5023440	All right.
5023440	5027080	So we're gonna get into the classic video game of the week.
5027080	5031800	It's a little part of the show where we like to pay homage to a game from yesteryear.
5031800	5033200	A game from the past.
5033200	5036400	And Dark Sakura is not here tonight to do this, so this is the part where Loki and I
5036400	5037400	will fill in.
5037400	5040200	I guess we're gonna do your game tonight, because I did it last time.
5040200	5042840	So Loki is gonna pick a game for us this week.
5042840	5048000	A classic video game that he thinks everybody out there on the internet who listens to our
5048000	5049000	show should be playing.
5049000	5051440	Loki, what is the classic video game of the week this week?
5051440	5053200	You know, I didn't know.
5053200	5056240	But actually, I just came up with one last minute.
5056240	5058040	Hooray for me!
5058040	5061320	No, actually, I want to pay homage to...
5061320	5066440	It's not even that old, I mean, I hate thinking that a Playstation 1 game is considered retro
5066440	5067440	now.
5067440	5075080	But I think one of the greatest in this game series, except for maybe Twisted Metal Black,
5075080	5080720	but Twisted Metal 2, Twisted Metal 2, as it was known in Europe as Twisted Metal 2 World
5080720	5088600	Tour, the second game in the vehicle combat series Twisted Metal, still one of my favorite
5088600	5091080	games, and they've remade it a few different times.
5091080	5096640	On the PSP they had Twisted Metal 2 head on, or Twisted Metal head on, I guess it was called.
5096640	5102240	But basically this game, very over the top, just killing each other, and each one won
5102240	5108480	the win the entire competition because they got a wish granted from Sweet Tooth, I believe,
5108480	5111880	or Dark Tooth, or whatever the other evil guy was.
5111880	5113880	I don't remember.
5113880	5114880	It's been a while.
5114880	5117760	Doesn't really matter, because who cares about the story when you're just going around major
5117760	5125000	cities like Paris, and Moscow, and stuff like that, and just destroying all sorts of stuff.
5125000	5126640	It was great.
5126640	5130000	Paris, you can actually destroy the Eiffel Tower.
5130000	5138120	LA, they had some ruins left over, I guess, from the previous Twisted Metal game.
5138120	5144600	In, let's see here, New York, they had the rooftops, which I think was my favorite map
5144600	5147200	of the entire game there.
5147200	5152440	Antarctica, they had some glaciers that were dropping, different icebergs sinking into
5152440	5153440	the ocean.
5153440	5159440	And then Hong Kong, they had the Hong Kong Crunch, which was set in the streets of Hong
5159440	5162040	Kong.
5162040	5167040	Of course there was some different characters that were added in the game.
5167040	5171600	They had Sweet Tooth, Dark Tooth, and Minion, which could be unlocked with different codes
5171600	5173600	in the game.
5173600	5178760	And I guess Dark Tooth was only playable on the PC version, or if you had a cheat device
5178760	5183880	for the Playstation 1, you could play Dark Tooth that way, which is kind of cool.
5183880	5191040	And he was a giant ice cream truck, because, yes, with a clown on top, because he was Sweet
5191040	5194120	Tooth's father, if I remember correctly.
5194120	5195520	Victoria actually played this game.
5195520	5198360	I heard her speak up, going, I remember this game!
5198360	5203600	Yes, because Dark Tooth was Charlie Kane, and then of course Sweet Tooth was Needles
5203600	5206040	Kane, and he had the ice cream truck.
5206040	5210880	Some of the other characters, Axl, which was a guy that was trapped in a vehicle, I guess,
5210880	5216560	by his father, with two giant tires, and so he was playing that.
5216560	5222400	Then Grasshopper, which was a dune buggy, which apparently was Calypso's daughter, and
5222400	5228000	Calypso, of course, was the guy that was running the entire tournament.
5228000	5236480	Mr. Grim, which was on a red motorcycle, and he consumed souls, which was kind of, sort
5236480	5239560	of kind of a Ghost Rider ripoff, I guess.
5239560	5242880	Minion, which was pretty fun, I think that was actually one of my favorite characters
5242880	5249520	to play, and it was a black battle tank, and then of course Specter, who had a sports car
5249520	5255800	with the missiles that would fly through things, like ghost missiles, and then a bunch of other
5255800	5258120	stuff in there.
5258120	5263740	Of course, I think that TwistML2, they had some levels that they cut out, that they brought
5263740	5270360	back for TwistML head-on, the PS2 version, they brought some that they had canceled actually,
5270360	5274800	I think they were making a, I don't know, more levels for TwistML Black that were added
5274800	5280600	into that game, and it was kind of a remake of TwistML2 and the TwistML Black engine,
5280600	5282800	which is pretty cool.
5282800	5287560	But unfortunately we still haven't seen another TwistML game since Black, and I don't really
5287560	5290720	count the PSP ones.
5290720	5294840	But hey, you know, they were talking about remaking, these were adding, making a new
5294840	5298160	one for PS3, and I think they should do it, because it was probably one of the best series
5298160	5300720	that was on the Playstation, so.
5300720	5302120	That's my classic game there.
5302120	5306120	Alright, there you have it, Twisted Metal 2, your classic game of the week.
5306120	5307120	That's a good pick.
5307120	5308120	That's not, that's not good enough.
5308120	5310680	That was pretty good for a last minute one, yeah.
5310680	5311680	Yeah, that was good.
5311680	5315040	The soccer has done Dreamcast games, and that was later in PS1.
5315040	5319160	Yeah, you can tell that I totally remember all the backstory on this, because I totally
5319160	5320160	butchered everything.
5320160	5321160	That's cool.
5321160	5322160	That's alright.
5322160	5323160	It was last minute.
5323160	5324160	You did good.
5324160	5325160	You did good.
5325160	5328200	Alright, so that's going to do it for part A of Orange Ons Radio, but that doesn't mean
5328200	5331320	the show's over, we're just going to take a break, and we'll be back, there's plenty
5331320	5332760	more where this came from.
5332760	5336540	Your calls as well, we'll get to a little later on in the show, we have some more news
5336540	5341560	in the next segment, we're going to be talking about some updates with the Pandora battery,
5341560	5345880	the controversial device for the PSP, also talk about some other PSP news, we have quite
5345880	5350640	a bit, as well as a very controversial Nintendo patent that was discovered this week.
5350640	5355700	It was something I kind of referred to earlier, to try and help those people that are really
5355700	5359800	bad at video games, but is it a good thing, or is it going to be a bad thing?
5359800	5360800	Who knows?
5360800	5365040	Anyhow, with all the talk about Silent Hill this week, for the live listeners, I'm going
5365040	5368880	to play some music from Silent Hill games, because who doesn't love the Silent Hill music,
5368880	5372680	but for those of you listening to the podcast, you don't get that because we're not allowed
5372680	5375840	to play copyright music, but we'll be right back in just a few seconds for you guys on
5375840	5376840	the podcast.
5376840	5379880	For those of you listening live, we'll be back in a few minutes here on Orange Lounge
5379880	5386720	Radio.
5386720	5389920	And we're back with more of Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast, taping
5389920	5394160	live here on January the 18th of 2009, to those of you guys who are just tuning in live
5394160	5395640	on AllGames.com.
5395640	5398040	Thank you guys for tuning in, tonight's kind of a weird night.
5398040	5401400	Mark Sacra is not here, she's on vacation just before school starts, so we brought in
5401400	5406640	two girls to replace her, well obviously she can never be replaced, but substitute tonight,
5406640	5409840	and so we have somebody who definitely looks like a naughty substitute teacher, Victoria
5409840	5410840	is here.
5410840	5411840	Yeah, and she's hot.
5411840	5412840	And she was flirting with the chatters.
5412840	5413840	Hi guys.
5413840	5414840	Oh, shut up.
5414840	5419520	Oh man, all Skype's going to be, hi Victoria, how's it going?
5419520	5424120	I did upload the picture that was requested earlier to my Twitter during the break, so
5424120	5430040	the boys could see it, and then we had a couple of chatters flirting with Victoria, so that's
5430040	5431040	cute.
5431040	5435440	So anyway, alright, but no more flirting, back to business, alright, we're back to work
5435440	5442000	here on Orange Lounge Radio, we got more gaming news to talk about, and yes we do, so, Loki
5442000	5445680	why don't you start us off, oh no, you're not gonna, are you starting us off, yes, alrighty
5445680	5446680	then.
5446680	5453280	Guitar Hero Metallica has been announced by Metallica that it is coming out in the US,
5453280	5461400	or North America I guess, March 29th, May, pretty much everywhere else.
5461400	5465720	It's interesting though, is the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions are coming out on the
5465720	5472160	29th, but the PS2 and the Wii version though are coming sometime this spring, most likely
5472160	5479720	early May, and this is according to the band's website, and of course, you know, it's gonna
5479720	5486400	have Expert Plus, 28 songs from the group's discography, as well as other tracks from
5486400	5492920	like Alice in Chains, The Food Fighters, Slayer, Machine Head, Queen, and stuff like that.
5492920	5498220	What's interesting though, and this is a little bit late news here, but they're gonna have
5498220	5504160	a special pre-order bonus actually being done through GameStop, which is surprising, they're
5504160	5511320	going to be giving away, with Guitar Hero Metallica, another drum pedal, because apparently
5511320	5516240	you're gonna need to have two pedals for the kick drum to be able to play some of those
5516240	5523640	songs, or you're probably gonna want to have two kick pedals, so that's kind of interesting.
5523640	5529400	But yeah, no other worry on that, but interesting to see this is gonna be the first Guitar Hero
5529400	5532020	game coming out this year, and I'm sure not the last.
5532020	5533120	First of many.
5533120	5535240	First of many, yeah.
5535240	5537400	How long before the series jumps the shark?
5537400	5539720	Oh wait, done!
5539720	5545680	Hey, Sony is going to be delivering of course more PSP and PlayStation 1 old titles on PlayStation
5545680	5550600	Network, and guess what, there is a PSP game that just came out I believe this week on
5550600	5553960	the PlayStation 3, it's Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins.
5553960	5558660	I believe Jamie spoke very highly of this game when she was here, it's kind of a put
5558660	5562640	together compilation of some of the old Ghosts and Goblins titles, it's now available for
5562640	5564480	download for $20.
5564480	5567860	There you have it, you can't play it on the PlayStation 3 because it was a PSP game, but
5567860	5572780	you can use your little transfer device and put it on your PSP if you have a large storage
5572780	5574500	stick for your PSP.
5574500	5575500	There you have it.
5575500	5581600	If you have a large stick, you can shut up, shut up.
5581600	5588080	There is a lawsuit in place for Datel, the makers of such wonderful devices as the Wii
5588080	5592720	freeloader, which apparently I don't think works anymore, I'm not sure, that's kind of
5592720	5599040	in limbo there, and also a third party battery that would have made it easier to hack the
5599040	5602360	PSP 3000 perhaps.
5602360	5608900	Lightblue Tool, which is their service mode battery that they've made, is just basically
5608900	5616400	a fancy name for the Pandora battery, they basically stole the idea for and decided that
5616400	5617600	they were going to put it out.
5617600	5623560	However, due to legal action by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, they are not able to
5623560	5629040	put out said battery, and yeah, they will not be releasing it.
5629040	5634720	But that's okay, because if you remember that there is an exploit now that's being used
5634720	5640280	that will eventually allow the PSP 3000 to be hacked using Grip Shift.
5640280	5645920	So that is coming along nicely, they already have some homebrew games available for it,
5645920	5649720	and soon enough a homebrew and firmware loader.
5649720	5650720	Cool.
5650720	5651720	Yeah.
5651720	5657000	What do you think will happen as a result of the lawsuit?
5657000	5662000	Nothing, they'll just stop making the battery and, you know, move on.
5662000	5664080	There'll be something else to hack the PSP with later?
5664080	5668480	There'll be something else, but the thing is, the fact that they were even releasing
5668480	5671840	that battery in the first place was kind of retarded, I mean, I know it is a little bit
5671840	5677760	difficult to make a Pandora's battery, but it can be done.
5677760	5682360	It's not too difficult if you just follow the instructions, but the fact that they were
5682360	5688640	kind of making this and claiming it as their own, you know, is kind of a rip-off, because
5688640	5690520	they did not come up with this idea.
5690520	5697320	All right, well speaking of hacking, DotHack, which is kind of a cult series on the PlayStation,
5697320	5698320	you ever played the DotHack games?
5698320	5700600	Yeah, I've never played them, but I'm familiar with them.
5700600	5704320	I own the very first one, the very, very first one I found for like 20 bucks somewhere.
5704320	5709240	They're kind of fun, they're very niche kind of titles, but, you know, I think they had
5709240	5710240	two different series.
5710240	5714040	They had the DotHack series and then there was DotHack GU, which was the later series.
5714040	5720400	Now DotHack Link was announced by Famitsu Magazine as coming to the PSP in 2009, so now it's
5720400	5723240	going from PlayStation 2 to PSP.
5723240	5726880	The interesting thing though they're saying is that, you know, part of what made DotHack
5726880	5729920	kind of interesting is that it was sort of like an MMO, but it wasn't.
5729920	5733600	It was a single player experience that was like an MMO, if that makes any sense.
5733600	5737120	Like, you know, all the characters that you came across were scripted and everything,
5737120	5739200	but it was kind of part of the niche of the game.
5739200	5742800	But they're thinking that this series is now going to be a little more like Monster Hunter,
5742800	5746360	because that's the very big series in Japan right now on the PSP.
5746360	5750640	So DotHack Link could be a little more Monster Hunter-esque, but I'm sure there's a lot of
5750640	5755000	anime fans that are going to be very excited to hear that DotHack is making a comeback on
5755000	5756000	the PSP.
5756000	5757000	Sweet.
5757000	5758000	Hooray.
5758000	5767000	Let's see here, some, I guess, interesting stuff coming out from a Sony survey, and we
5767000	5769840	all love these surveys that they put out.
5769840	5777240	Speculation of what exactly might be coming to the PSP2, and this new survey of course
5777240	5783960	was asking, you know, gamers what features they would like seen in the new console, and
5783960	5789960	some of the stuff that they were suggesting here, let's see, possible features include
5789960	5798720	smaller, yet retain most of the current PSP screen size, offered social networking functionality
5798720	5806480	in the cross-media bar, included a keyboard for easier internet browsing and communication,
5806480	5812680	offered Bluetooth wireless support for easy pairing with other devices, had a touchscreen,
5812680	5818520	had an improved screen for more dynamic graphic displays, offered the ability to find others
5818520	5826260	near you who want to connect for online gaming, offered an e-comic book or book download service
5826260	5834000	through the PlayStation Network, and included a hard drive for memory storage.
5834000	5843400	And some other things, they were also talking about built-in GPS, and yeah, interesting.
5843400	5845960	I have a feeling that they're going to do a touchscreen at the next one.
5845960	5850960	They kind of have to at this point, if you think about it.
5850960	5853400	And motion-sensoring, I mean, why not?
5853400	5857880	Do you think it's for, like, another PSP redo, or do you think this is for, like, the next
5857880	5860400	PSP, whatever it is, like the PSV2, or whatever?
5860400	5862560	I think it would have to be for the next one.
5862560	5867560	I mean, they could still do another redo of it or whatever, because I think there was
5867560	5871200	some rumors about PSP 4000.
5871200	5875880	I don't know, though, if they would just put a touchscreen on, you know, a new PSP or something
5875880	5876880	like that.
5876880	5880200	A lot of these, I mean, other than, like, social networking, that wouldn't be too bad,
5880200	5884800	or like a book download service, I mean, you can do e-books right now if you're homebrew
5884800	5891840	stuff, so that could be done now, and even the ability to find others near you that,
5891840	5894200	you know, want to connect for an online game.
5894200	5899640	I don't really see that as kind of a necessity, because that would require a lot of hotspots
5899640	5903840	and stuff like that, and it wouldn't really make sense that you would need, you know,
5903840	5907440	to know if there's someone nearby to connect with, because you're connected with anybody
5907440	5912040	over the internet, so it doesn't really matter.
5912040	5918480	Maybe Bluetooth support for, like, using, like, say, your 6-axis controller might be
5918480	5921680	kind of cool.
5921680	5924640	Let's read some comments from the chat room, chat.orensontraded.com, we've had a lot of
5924640	5928500	PSP different stories, I want to kind of read through some of these, because lots of diverse
5928500	5930120	comments from our chat.
5930120	5934080	Reddertainment says, why is Dattell getting sued for selling something that you can hack
5934080	5935520	the PSP with?
5935520	5939840	People who sell rocks don't get sued for possibly causing car break-ins.
5939840	5942160	But this is the case with a lot of these, you know, companies that get sued, right?
5942160	5947900	I think it has to do with infringing on some sort of stuff, probably information that was
5947900	5953700	written on the ROM of the battery, because the actual batteries that Sony uses actually
5953700	5959000	have data written on to them, so if, for example, they use that to reverse engineer something
5959000	5966860	to create a program, that would violate copyrights, and then they could stop them, I guess.
5966860	5970880	And also probably, you know, Dattell's not really a large company, and Sony is a lot
5970880	5975880	bigger, and they could probably bully them into doing whatever they want, so.
5975880	5981960	But more likely, you know, the prior, that they actually reverse engineered something,
5981960	5990260	and because of that, you know, it's not licensed, so, you know, they gotta put a stop to it.
5990260	5994240	Also some other things I want to read here, Jiove Dea, who's very excited about a new
5994240	5999420	.hack game coming out, says I wish those fuckers would have brought the actual.hack MMO over
5999420	6004680	even if it sucked balls, and XLink confirms there was a.hack MMO in Japan but it was
6004680	6006080	shut down.
6006080	6012240	D5T says.hack link for the PSP is going to be the last game, FYI.
6012240	6014920	So I don't know if it's gonna, I guess not a series, because all the other.hack games
6014920	6019440	were in series, I think the first one had four games, the other one had three, so that's
6019440	6022040	kind of weird that this would be a one-off game.
6022040	6027000	Hopefully it's a lot of game, because.hack got a big, I guess a very cult-type game.
6027000	6029780	There's a lot of people who've never heard of these games, but then I think there's enough
6029780	6032800	of our audience who like the anime and all that stuff too that I'm sure know about these
6032800	6033800	games.
6033800	6034800	I was pretty excited about it.
6034800	6038740	Well you know Monster Hunter, they're basically trying to recreate Monster Hunter over, find
6038740	6043240	anything that would work as a Monster Hunter game, because those are insanely popular in
6043240	6047120	Japan right now and especially with the new Monster Hunter game coming out on the Wii,
6047120	6050440	that's gonna probably take off really well.
6050440	6054160	They're trying to find more stuff that's kinda similar to Monster Hunter and if they try
6054160	6058640	to make their game more like Monster Hunter, then maybe they'll try to get that same type
6058640	6060200	of appeal that that game had.
6060200	6062880	There were some other games that they were trying to make like Monster Hunter too, I
6062880	6064680	I can't remember what it was, though.
6064680	6068160	But some other series game that they're changing up.
6068160	6070080	Interesting speculation in chat, too, by Alpha
6070080	6074200	Kananagrams says, maybe.hack link has DLC.
6074200	6074600	Good.
6074600	6076240	I don't know, a place for a PSP game.
6076240	6078400	That would be very interesting, but good.
6078400	6082920	All right, anyhow, let's go into a new story, kind of
6082920	6084600	getting away from the PSP stuff a little bit.
6084600	6087640	This is kind of one of those sad story things.
6087640	6090760	Apparently, in Illinois, there's a town there in
6090760	6093720	Illinois who put a new tax out on video game machines.
6093720	6096960	And it caused a small arcade to basically go under.
6096960	6099080	It was a place called the Name Your Game Store, and it was
6099080	6101200	located in Hampshire.
6101200	6103760	It was apparently a very popular after-school hangout.
6103760	6107680	It had games, snacks, cards, clothing, of all things.
6107680	6109360	So it was kind of like a little hodgepodge of cool
6109360	6112560	stuff, sounds like, a place for kids to go hang out.
6112560	6115160	The proprietors were Bob and Gina Pearson.
6115160	6121880	Apparently, a $250 annual tax per machine on these games,
6121880	6124440	they had to get rid of the 10 games that they had.
6124440	6127800	Glow-in-the-dark air hockey, NASCAR racing, Ms. Pac-Man all
6127800	6130720	bit the dust because of this new tax in the town.
6130720	6132920	Here's a quote from one of the owners.
6132920	6135040	We didn't renew the licenses because the machines didn't
6135040	6137600	even make what you charge in these astronomical fees.
6137600	6139560	The game companies tell us this is one of the highest
6139560	6140520	fees in Illinois.
6140520	6142840	We wonder if the village really researched how big this
6142840	6145000	should be or if they just slapped a number on it.
6145000	6147240	We had become a pretty big hangout for kids after school
6147240	6149840	and weekends, but not having the video games this year has
6149840	6152880	made a big impact in just the first two weeks.
6152880	6156680	So apparently, somebody who works for the town told the
6156680	6159440	local news that they set the fee high with the
6159440	6162840	understanding that the game machine distribution companies
6162840	6166040	would actually pay the fees.
6166040	6169240	But one of the proprietors said that only happens when
6169240	6172400	you actually serve alcohol in the establishment.
6172400	6176760	So what was the purpose of this tax or whatever it's
6176760	6177720	supposed to be?
6177720	6178760	Just to get money.
6178760	6179360	I guess.
6179360	6179840	Why not?
6179840	6181120	It's the most random thing ever.
6181120	6182720	Like, oh, and by the way.
6182720	6185640	Well, in this economy, you've got to balance the budget in
6185640	6186360	weird ways, right?
6186360	6189160	Yeah, but that seems really weird, though, the tax.
6189160	6190200	First off, arcade games.
6190200	6193120	I would think, I mean, let's just look at, for example,
6193120	6195320	like Rancho Cordova or something like that.
6195320	6198000	I can't imagine that there's over 100 arcade
6198000	6199600	games in this city.
6199600	6203080	I would be surprised if there are over 50 arcade games in
6203080	6205480	this city, let alone enough.
6205480	6207440	I don't know of many at all that would be
6207440	6208320	independently owned.
6208320	6210840	Maybe at that pool place I've never been to up the street.
6210840	6211600	They probably have some.
6211600	6212760	But see, that's the thing, though.
6212760	6215160	It's random and arbitrary.
6215160	6216760	Oh, yeah, and all of a sudden, let's just pull
6216760	6217520	this out of our ass.
6217520	6218080	There has to be something behind it.
6218080	6221120	Well, it sounds like other, because when the lady quoted
6221120	6223760	about places that sell alcohol in all this, too, she sounded
6223760	6226280	like this isn't unheard of.
6226280	6228160	Because it sounded like she had a point of reference.
6228160	6229760	So I guess this whole thing is not heard.
6229760	6230880	I'd never heard of this before.
6230880	6233600	But it seems weird, though, that you would be able to tax
6233600	6235760	something like that because you're still
6235760	6238400	paying taxes on it.
6238400	6241080	You're paying taxes on your revenue that you bring in.
6241080	6242320	So why tax it again?
6242320	6243880	There has to be something behind it.
6243880	6247120	There has to be maybe it was targeted at that place or
6247120	6249320	something, or the places like this where kids hang out.
6249320	6251760	Maybe they think they're going to become delinquent or
6251760	6254480	something if they spend their time doing that instead of
6254480	6255720	other stuff.
6255720	6260040	Tigerclaw says, if you read between the lines, this was
6260040	6262080	their way of getting rid of video games in these places so
6262080	6263760	kids go home and do their homework.
6263760	6264640	I don't know, Tigerclaw.
6264640	6265520	I kind of disagree.
6265520	6267520	I think some of these kids, if they don't have another place
6267520	6272600	to go, they're going to turn to graffiti and murder.
6272600	6273160	I'm just kidding.
6273160	6275040	But more of the latter.
6275040	6276720	But you know what I'm talking about?
6276720	6280920	Like, at least in these types of places, it's, you know.
6280920	6283520	Yeah, that's exactly what these
6283520	6284720	establishments are there for.
6284720	6287600	If parents aren't enforcing their kids to, like, do their
6287600	6289960	homework and stuff, they're going in at least playing
6289960	6291440	video games or something like that.
6291440	6293200	You know, they're not out on the street or anything.
6293200	6296160	So I just think that's kind of odd.
6296160	6299440	In other words, kids hanging out at this place is because
6299440	6301880	their parents aren't making them go home
6301880	6302760	and do their homework.
6302760	6305640	So if they're not here at this place hanging out, they'll be
6305640	6306320	somewhere else.
6306320	6307640	Yeah, they're not going to be going home.
6307640	6308840	They're not going to go home.
6308840	6310040	Oh, shucks.
6310040	6311280	No more Ms. Pac-Man for me.
6311280	6312600	I guess I'll go do homework.
6312600	6315040	Because that's what my brothers and I did, like our
6315040	6316840	parents didn't give a shit if we came home and did our
6316840	6317520	homework after school.
6317520	6320960	So we went to the arcade, you know, like, so we probably
6320960	6325080	would have become druggies and like murderous convicts were
6325080	6326280	it not for video games.
6326280	6327160	So I don't know.
6327160	6328720	That's just kind of wacky.
6328720	6329200	I don't know.
6329200	6331760	SSJ100 Matt says, so things are going to turn into Jet Set
6331760	6332920	Radio, basically.
6332920	6334160	Yeah, there you go.
6334160	6334920	It's all going to start.
6334920	6338280	We're all going to strap on roller blades and go around
6338280	6340320	and spray paint shit.
6340320	6341720	Yep.
6341720	6345440	So kind of sad.
6345440	6345920	I don't know.
6345920	6347560	Maybe we should try to email these people and
6347560	6349120	get them on the show.
6349120	6352640	These are the types of stories I want to dig into.
6352640	6356000	Are you going to be like, call Rob or whatever?
6356000	6357800	Not, you know, like the local show?
6357800	6359480	Like the local news and stuff?
6359480	6360520	Well, here's the thing.
6360520	6362840	All the other shows, you know, they're trying to get the one
6362840	6364520	up guys and all that on their show.
6364520	6366840	Because that's what everybody's, you know, I don't
6366840	6369120	care, I'm over all that stuff.
6369120	6372160	Let's get these little niche stories and get them on the
6372160	6375520	show and talk about why was your town out to screw you?
6375520	6376320	We want answers.
6376320	6378560	We demand to know.
6378560	6382680	Asking questions, getting answers.
6382680	6385360	Oh my God, Rob, you're going to make an impact.
6385360	6387280	All right, we'll see.
6387280	6387840	We'll see.
6387840	6389440	All right, let's move on.
6389440	6391360	Loki, do you have some other news for us?
6391360	6392200	Maybe happier news?
6392200	6395120	Maybe this is why they're getting rid of the arcades for
6395120	6397480	games like Mortal Kombat.
6397480	6398400	Yes, that's right.
6398400	6402520	The Mortal Kombat killer has gotten 36 years.
6402520	6405720	Lamar Roberts, the teenager convicted of beating to death a
6405720	6410040	seven-year-old, will be sentenced to 36 years.
6410040	6414320	Apparently, this happened in 2007.
6414320	6419840	I guess they beat up Zo Garcia, a seven-year-old who
6419840	6422560	was described, I guess, by prosecutors and law
6422560	6426320	enforcement in Greeley, Colorado.
6426320	6429600	They were beating her up as an reenactment of the fight
6429600	6431720	moves from Mortal Kombat.
6431720	6434880	And says Robert and his 17-year-old girlfriend were
6434880	6438720	supposedly supposed to be babysitting the child.
6438720	6439920	They uppercutted a baby.
6439920	6443480	And said that two kicked, hit, and slammed his half
6443480	6446080	sister to the floor.
6446080	6451360	OK, did they confuse their babality with the fatality?
6451360	6452480	I can't even joke.
6452480	6453040	This is terrible.
6453040	6454000	I know, that is awful.
6454000	6458440	I probably shouldn't have said that, but wow.
6458440	6461200	They must be stupid.
6461200	6464160	Only 36 years, just 36 years.
6464160	6465360	I mean, really?
6465360	6466440	Really?
6466440	6467240	Seriously?
6467240	6471080	Are prisons like that hard up for cash?
6471080	6472320	Yeah, that's pretty sad.
6472320	6474880	But here's something you can laugh at, because it's funny
6474880	6475960	and it's ridiculous.
6475960	6477560	And I don't think anyone got hurt.
6477560	6483600	But apparently, there is a new assailant to compete against
6483600	6488120	the Mortal Kombat killer for press, the Xbox Taco
6488120	6489880	assailant.
6489880	6494040	Yes, apparently law enforcement near Orlando, Florida.
6494040	6496800	This is one of the stories that I've read so far, so it's good.
6496800	6499680	They have in custody a 19-year-old who refused to
6499680	6503760	stop playing games to join his family for dinner and throw a
6503760	6507920	taco at his mother after she unplugged his Xbox.
6507920	6513240	Apparently, this was reported as a domestic disturbance.
6513240	6520720	And apparently, there is some name calling that says,
6520720	6524520	seems his mom went upstairs and demanded he stop playing
6524520	6527680	that Sega or Atari or whatever you call it and come down to be
6527680	6530160	a contributing member of the family.
6530160	6535560	And he was all, whatever, bitch, she said.
6535560	6536760	And he flung the taco.
6536760	6539160	Is this for real?
6539160	6542000	Yeah, he says they actually have a screen capture from the
6542000	6545440	news thing, and he's making a weird little face on it.
6545440	6550680	Yeah, WFL-TV is the news station covering it.
6550680	6554400	And she says she was going to let him sit in his jail cell
6554400	6556880	for a few days and teach him a lesson.
6556880	6560800	They need to show no mercy to this kid.
6560800	6562120	It's funny, it's all a few minutes.
6562120	6564240	You know what they should do as punishment is make him work
6564240	6568200	a Taco Bell and see what exactly it takes to get in to
6568200	6571960	make a taco, because I don't know anybody who's ever worked
6571960	6574200	a Taco Bell that would enjoy their job.
6574200	6576080	Here's the quote from Dina, his sponsor.
6576080	6580840	A few minutes later, Dina says she was in the kitchen
6580840	6584880	cleaning and cooking tacos for dinner when Zachary showed up.
6584880	6587720	That's when she says he slapped her arm and threw a
6587720	6589880	taco in her face.
6589880	6595320	He went ahead and hit me with the taco and I got taco all
6595320	6596760	over my shirt and the kitchen.
6596760	6598560	I've threatened to call the police before.
6598560	6601520	But anyway, this time I thought he went too far, so I
6601520	6604280	called the police and he's in jail now.
6604280	6606960	Leo Shen sums it up in chat, says that he should rot in
6606960	6609880	jail, he wasted a good taco.
6609880	6613080	That's taco side, no one commits taco side.
6613080	6616440	I can imagine Eric right now like, no.
6616440	6619360	All right, and finally, this is a little bit more recent.
6622280	6626400	There's a 17-year-old, Daniel Petrick of Ohio, he's been
6626400	6631400	found guilty of shooting both of his parents, which led to
6631400	6633320	the death of his mother, his dad, survived.
6633320	6637480	And apparently he has been found guilty.
6637480	6642200	This was because they took away Halo from him, Halo 3.
6642200	6643800	He's a 15-year-old, by the way.
6643800	6649160	And it says they took his copy of Halo 3 away, mature rated
6649160	6654160	title, after they had previously refused him from
6654160	6655120	playing the game.
6655120	6659240	And so he basically told them, I have a surprise for you,
6659240	6659880	close your eyes.
6659880	6661040	And he shot them both in the face.
6661040	6662960	Oh my god.
6662960	6663760	That's terrible.
6663760	6664240	With a taco.
6664240	6665120	No, I'm just kidding.
6665120	6666280	That's awful.
6666280	6667720	That is so bad.
6667720	6669800	I got, sorry, I have to say this.
6669800	6671200	I know this is like a horrible story.
6671200	6673520	I have to go back to the taco thing, because this is one we
6673520	6674640	could actually laugh at, right?
6674640	6675920	The other ones are terrible, right?
6675920	6679200	But comments from chat, D5T says, if I went to jail every
6679200	6682600	time I threw food at my mom.
6682600	6685320	And I'm thinking, my mom and I did get into a fight over
6685320	6686480	M&M's once, so that's what I'm sure of.
6686480	6688160	I remember, you didn't throw them though.
6688160	6688640	You broke them to death.
6688640	6691000	I didn't throw them, but it was a different story.
6691000	6693320	Um, Deakman says, I see nothing wrong with tacos
6693320	6694440	getting thrown at my face.
6694440	6695960	Like, if you open, it could be like a game.
6695960	6697640	If you open your mouth, try to catch them.
6697640	6702600	OK, but here is the huge, huge news.
6702600	6706760	Apparently, one of our listeners does not live that
6706760	6708160	far from the taco person.
6708160	6708600	Really?
6708600	6710280	And is going to try and get them on the show.
6710280	6713240	Oh, that'd be awesome.
6713240	6714680	Oh, be careful, dude.
6714680	6718320	We're going to have to bump the Tax Town people to get the
6718320	6719960	taco assailant on the show.
6719960	6722200	I must speak to the taco kid.
6722200	6724880	Keep your mouth open, dude, in case he throws any tacos.
6724880	6727000	Just be careful.
6727000	6729000	OK, and then here's the best part about
6729000	6730080	the halo murder thing.
6730080	6733400	Apparently, the judge, James Burge, told the courtroom,
6733400	6737280	it's my firm belief as a human being, and not just as a
6737280	6742880	jurist, that Daniel does suffer from a serious defect
6742880	6744000	of the mind.
6744000	6749720	And apparently, believes that games are somehow
6749720	6753360	involved, that he says, I firmly believe Daniel had no
6753360	6756880	idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed
6756880	6759840	his parents, they would be dead forever.
6759840	6764320	That he was so far into the Halo 3 world that he separated
6764320	6765560	himself from reality.
6765560	6768000	Would he be like that, calling from earlier?
6768000	6771760	So would they like respawn, like parents respawn?
6771760	6773760	He'd be like that, calling from earlier.
6773760	6777720	You know, it died and came back to life.
6777720	6779040	Mom?
6779040	6780360	Oh my god.
6780360	6785840	This is like there's a special place in hell where
6785840	6787000	this show is waiting.
6787000	6791520	I don't know who's stupider, that kid or that juror.
6791520	6792600	No, that's a judge.
6792600	6794600	I mean, wow.
6794600	6797440	OK, this part.
6797440	6799840	Yeah, that's pretty ridiculous.
6799840	6802480	I mean, I'm sure that kid's stupid, but I don't know if
6802480	6803680	he's that stupid.
6803680	6807160	No, I think he knew exactly what he was doing.
6807160	6810640	But now he figured out I got to go to jail forever.
6810640	6811880	I'm insane.
6814680	6816800	Please don't kill me in the face.
6816800	6819120	In the face.
6819120	6820520	I don't know.
6820520	6821480	I don't even know what to say.
6821480	6823320	This isn't even really a story about video
6823320	6824320	games at this point.
6824320	6827000	This kid obviously has like a ton of issues.
6827000	6828600	Can we just talk about the Taco Kid some more?
6828600	6830040	Yes, the Taco Kid's awesome.
6833160	6837120	But I just wanted to point out that here live in studio,
6837120	6842120	I'm now the snickerdoodle assailant.
6842120	6843120	Open your mouth.
6843120	6844600	Oh, you wasted my cookie.
6844600	6846560	Pick it up and eat it.
6846560	6847840	Spin on my boobie.
6847840	6848920	I'll eat your cookie.
6848920	6851480	I threw a snickerdoodle and it hit Irene in the boob.
6858480	6862000	It was deliciously painful.
6862000	6865160	All right, look, we're going to dedicate a certain segment
6865160	6866320	of our show we do here.
6866320	6866840	Love you.
6866840	6868880	We're going to dedicate a certain part of our show
6868880	6870960	here we do every week to these guys who
6870960	6873240	are ruining the image of video gamers
6873240	6875160	everywhere with their stupidity.
6875160	6877120	And it's a segment called the FUs of the Week.
6877120	6896840	Since we don't have Dark Sakura tonight to start us off we'll let Loki start us off with the FUs of the Week today.
6896840	6903360	Fucking Rockstar Games for making a really crappy port of Grand Theft Auto IV on the PC.
6903360	6908640	There's no reason whatsoever that the game should work for a while then all of a sudden just stop.
6908640	6909920	I didn't install anything.
6909920	6910960	I didn't change anything.
6910960	6915440	It just said I'm not working no more and just stop working.
6915440	6916520	Now I reinstall it.
6916520	6920960	I've uninstalled everything including secure ROM, all my video drivers,
6920960	6924720	every little bit of crap that would possibly affect this game.
6924720	6926560	I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it.
6926560	6927280	Nothing.
6927280	6929720	It just broke in.
6929720	6930360	Bullshit.
6930360	6933000	Why should I pay for an actual game and have it not work?
6933000	6933520	That's it.
6933520	6934840	Never do it again.
6934840	6935160	I know.
6935160	6935760	That's ridiculous.
6935760	6938960	I am never buying a PC game ever again.
6938960	6941720	Especially Rockstar Games.
6941720	6942920	Never again.
6942920	6943840	Don't do it.
6943840	6949760	My FU of the Week, if you're done, my FU of the Week goes to my tooth because it hurts.
6949760	6951240	And I have to go to the dentist tomorrow.
6951240	6953000	And I don't like going to the dentist.
6953000	6955760	I think I mentioned this on the show before because it's like going to a used car salesman.
6955760	6957840	Because then they're going to tell me, oh, you need to have this done.
6957840	6959360	Oh, and by the way, you need to get this done.
6959360	6960440	You need to replace this crown.
6960440	6961360	It's going to cost this much money.
6961360	6962160	And it's like, ugh.
6962160	6964400	I thought you had an awesome dentist, though.
6964400	6965040	No.
6965040	6965680	Do that crap.
6965680	6966760	No.
6966760	6967360	No.
6967360	6967840	OK.
6967840	6969040	You want to hear something funny?
6969040	6969400	What?
6969400	6972360	I'm a horrible, I'm horrible when it comes to oral hygiene.
6972360	6973960	Like, they tell me to floss.
6973960	6975040	I'm like, yeah, I'll floss.
6975040	6976320	And I totally forget.
6976320	6979120	But OK, so yeah, nobody flosses.
6979120	6983120	So anyways, they keep telling me, yeah, you got to floss because your gums are all, you know,
6983120	6985360	they're going to get fucked up and that kind of stuff.
6985360	6987720	So I haven't flossed for a year since I saw them last.
6987720	6989400	And they said that it looked better.
6989400	6991120	I'm like, have you been flossing?
6991120	6992680	I'm like, yeah, sure, I've been flossing all the time.
6992680	6994440	Oh, well, it looks like it's doing a good job.
6994440	6995600	So yes, they're full of shit.
6995600	6996560	That's basically it.
6996560	6999920	I've seen more unicorns than people flossing.
6999920	7002040	Like, nobody flosses.
7002040	7005800	SSJ100Matt wants to point out that his dad's a dentist, but he's an honest dentist.
7005800	7008360	Look, if I lived in New York City, I would happily go to your dad.
7008360	7011800	Like, I need a friend who's a dentist or who goes to the dentist.
7011800	7012640	I have a friend who's a dentist.
7012640	7013200	Really?
7013200	7014520	Yeah, he's starting his own practice.
7014520	7017960	I want to go see them because I want to go see somebody I trust.
7017960	7019080	Yeah.
7019080	7021000	You can go to a dental school.
7021000	7021680	Blah.
7021680	7022440	Blah.
7022440	7023400	At least they're honest.
7023400	7025240	That's what poor people do.
7025240	7027080	I'm just kidding.
7027080	7028640	At least we ain't paying for any shit.
7028640	7029440	Look, we've all been there, Victoria.
7029440	7031840	We've all been there, OK?
7031840	7033960	You're a young 21 still.
7033960	7035120	You're in that phase.
7035120	7037680	A young, beautiful, single 21-year-old gal.
7037680	7038880	With big titties.
7038880	7039360	Yes.
7039360	7040200	She's the one.
7040200	7043240	Quit trying to pimp me.
7043240	7046400	I want to say, there is somebody in chat right now with the nickname that
7046400	7047800	says, I love Victoria.
7047800	7052920	Aw, I hurt you too, whoever you are.
7052920	7054960	All right, so my F.U. of the week goes to my tooth.
7054960	7056720	Victoria, do you have any F.U.s of the week?
7056720	7060840	My F.U. of the week is to the person who didn't turn my keys in.
7060840	7063320	Whoever found my keys at work and didn't turn them
7063320	7066040	in since I've been locked out of my apartment for the past three fucking
7066040	7067720	days.
7067720	7068240	Not really.
7068240	7071280	That's the biggest F.U. of the week that I have.
7071280	7074280	And to my phone that's flashing an evil red color at me
7074280	7076240	because it needs to be charged.
7076240	7076720	Uh-oh.
7076720	7078320	That's it.
7078320	7080680	And Rice Princess, do you have any F.U.s?
7080680	7083520	Yeah, F.U. to you for hitting my titty.
7083520	7084160	You liked it.
7084160	7085400	You wasted a snickerdoodle.
7085400	7086360	You liked it a little bit.
7086360	7087560	I'll give it to John when he gets back.
7087560	7090960	I'll put it on a plate and say, we saved you a snickerdoodle.
7090960	7094720	Just brush off the little bit of dust and pee pee on it.
7094720	7098480	Oh my god, if he ever finds out it touched my boob, he'll die.
7098480	7101080	He'd be like, oh my god, I had a woman's breast in my mouth.
7101080	7102960	I'm going to put it back on the plate when no one's looking.
7102960	7106640	And then it's like a game of Russian snickerdoodle roulette.
7106640	7108080	Yeah, you see.
7108080	7111600	One of these was on Irene's booby.
7111600	7113300	Do you want to eat one and take a chance?
7113300	7114600	It's the one that's dead to you.
7114600	7118120	Or do you want to possibly inadvertently lick her boob?
7118120	7119320	Let's not talk about this.
7119320	7120840	Yeah, let's not.
7120840	7121760	All right.
7121760	7124040	Anyway, that's going to do it for the F.U.s of the week
7124040	7124680	on that note.
7124680	7126400	So let's get back into some gaming news.
7126400	7128840	And this is actually some big news that came out this week,
7128840	7130200	a patent that was revealed.
7130200	7132200	Now this is what I was kind of talking to Victoria
7132200	7133960	a little bit about before, is that she
7133960	7135440	was talking about how video games get too hard
7135440	7138280	and she gets too frustrated and throws a controller, right?
7138280	7142320	Here's what's interesting, is that apparently Miyamoto
7142320	7143680	has filed a patent.
7143680	7146140	And I don't know if it's him or like his company or whatever,
7146140	7148000	but basically Nintendo has filed the patent.
7148000	7151960	And it has been discovered for a computable readable storage
7151960	7152520	medium.
7152520	7159800	But what the medium is is basically kind of a hint system.
7159800	7162120	And the game that they kind of show pictures of
7162120	7165880	is a work in progress called Legend of O.O., which could
7165880	7168320	possibly be a Legend of Zelda game.
7168320	7169920	But here's the interesting thing.
7169920	7172920	This patent is very, very, very wordy, kind of goes on.
7172920	7175200	It talks about these different gameplay features
7175200	7179040	that include hint videos that are actually already there
7179040	7181240	inside the game that would unlock,
7181240	7183880	if you've been stuck on a puzzle for so long,
7183880	7186180	then a hint video will show up.
7186180	7189480	A mode called the digest, which will actually just show
7189480	7192520	the game's cinematics and gameplay sequences just
7192520	7193400	as a movie.
7193400	7195600	And you can take control at any point you want.
7195600	7197560	And then a scene menu, which lets
7197560	7201120	you choose exactly where you want to go into the story.
7201120	7204760	So it's kind of like this extreme hybrid
7204760	7208800	of mixing a video game with DVD features, almost.
7208800	7210760	Kind of interesting.
7210760	7212480	And then you just add on to this the fact
7212480	7215040	that Miyamoto has said before that he
7215040	7217260	wants to make more Zelda Wii titles more
7217260	7220040	accessible to a broad audience.
7220040	7222800	Could this actually be something that they
7222800	7225400	are going to implement in a future Zelda title?
7225400	7226640	Possibly.
7226640	7227960	Well, what do you think of that?
7227960	7231840	I mean, is that dumbing down the game too much?
7231840	7236080	Is that taking the game out of the video game?
7236080	7242120	I think it's kind of, for us, the hardcore gamers,
7242120	7244520	the gamers who've been playing games for all of our life,
7244520	7246520	we're probably not going to be big fans of that.
7246520	7249600	But yeah, it's going to bring new people into games.
7249600	7251800	So let me ask Victoria, even though she's
7251800	7254720	tapping away on the laptop, it's somebody else right now.
7254720	7257080	What if they had a game, like one of these games
7257080	7258440	you'd get really frustrated at.
7258440	7259920	But you could just say you throw the controller
7259920	7260840	because it's too hard.
7260840	7262520	What if suddenly the game said, hey, it
7262520	7263480	looks like you're stuck.
7263480	7265760	Let me show you a video of how to get past this part.
7265760	7268280	Would that make the game more appealing to you?
7268280	7269320	It would probably help.
7269320	7270520	But I'd probably get annoyed because I
7270520	7272320	wouldn't be able to be like, what the hell?
7272320	7273480	What's going on?
7273480	7274400	How do I get up there?
7274400	7275280	You know what I mean?
7275280	7277040	That's usually my problem with games
7277040	7280520	is I have to get up somewhere and, you know.
7280520	7282360	What if the game said, press this button
7282360	7284080	and I'll take you past this point?
7284080	7284960	Then I'll play.
7284960	7286920	Then I'd be like, all right, bring it, bitch.
7286920	7288300	What would draw you to that, though?
7288300	7292200	What would try to play the game if there's no challenge?
7292200	7295360	I'm sorry, I just read something funny about the thing.
7295360	7298240	I don't know, what was the question?
7298240	7300080	What would draw you, if you could just
7300080	7302600	hit the button and skip that part to get up the ledge
7302600	7304640	or get to where you need to go, fast forward or whatever.
7304640	7306180	What's the draw to the game to you?
7306180	7308200	Well then, I just think it'd make it easier
7308200	7311200	for me to play it, because I'm not very video game savvy,
7311200	7314440	as I've said already.
7314440	7318260	But I just think it would make it easier for me to play it.
7318260	7320840	I think me and the 4-year-olds who
7320840	7323240	can't play video games very well,
7323240	7325200	I'm assuming there are 4-year-olds out there who can't
7325200	7328380	play video games very well.
7328380	7331040	But yeah, I think that's the biggest appeal,
7331040	7334160	I could just say, oh, you too can play video games.
7334160	7337560	You don't have to be as awesome as Rob or Matt or Irene to play video games.
7337560	7341360	Which is funny because people assume because we host this show that we're actually good at video games,
7341360	7342360	but that's so not true.
7342360	7343460	I've seen you play video games.
7343460	7345060	You've seen me play Rock Band.
7345060	7347260	Oh yeah, you're pretty- he's pretty badass at Rock Band, guys.
7347260	7349960	But here's the thing, here's- here's- I don't know.
7349960	7351560	No, Loki, please, I'd like to hear your-
7351560	7353160	Here's my issue with it.
7353160	7357560	If the game is designed well in the beginning, you shouldn't have problems figuring out what you need to do,
7357560	7361360	because it gradually teaches you the skills in the game that you need to learn,
7361360	7365160	and teaches you how to solve different puzzles, and then says go do it.
7365160	7369160	And you should know how to do it if it's been done right.
7369160	7373360	Now, if you're gonna put this together- put together a game that's like poorly done,
7373360	7375960	then yeah, you're gonna need this stupid cheat system and stuff.
7375960	7381960	And I think it's a waste of time anyways, because it would be like showing somebody how-
7381960	7383860	Okay, here's a video of how you do this.
7383860	7385660	And they're like, huh?
7385660	7386960	Okay, hit this button, then go past it.
7386960	7389260	Great, okay, now I'm at another scene that's too hard.
7389260	7391260	Oh, I'm gonna hit this button, then go past it again.
7391260	7392160	Read a book!
7392160	7392960	Go read a book!
7392960	7393960	Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
7393960	7396760	It's like, God, I don't want to invest time to figure out what the story is.
7396760	7398660	Let me just read the end and figure out what happens.
7398660	7400960	Oh, and then it ruins it for me.
7400960	7402260	It'd be just like Animal Crossing.
7402260	7405760	Oh, I don't want to wait here and, you know, pay off Tom Nook's mortgage or whatever.
7405760	7407560	Let me just, you know, cheat and have lots of money.
7407560	7410060	Look, now I have no purpose to this game anymore.
7410060	7414760	Which is, by the way, what happened with Animal Crossing, but I had no purpose to begin with anyways, so.
7414760	7416260	Um.
7416260	7419960	It- I think it's a horrible idea, and I see what they're trying to do,
7419960	7422960	because they're still, you know, having this dilemma.
7422960	7428060	How do we sell games to people that only want to play Wii Sports, and now Wii Fit?
7428060	7430160	How do we sell games to them?
7430160	7431060	And they don't know.
7431060	7435860	And this is a problem, because they're never gonna figure this out, this console generation,
7435860	7440660	and they're gonna- I have a feeling they're gonna sell millions of systems,
7440660	7443360	but they're not gonna sell millions of games.
7443360	7446360	And that's a problem, because, you know, the only things they're selling right now
7446360	7449160	are the things that they're making hard to find.
7449160	7453960	Because, trust me, I'm sorry, Mario Kart's been out since last April.
7453960	7457760	It's- we're coming upon almost a year of it being out.
7457760	7460460	There's no fucking reason that should be a shortage right now.
7460460	7464160	It's a game and a goddamn steering wheel that's a piece of plastic.
7464160	7466360	Shit, they make plastic toys like crazy.
7466360	7467760	They're in supermarkets everywhere.
7467760	7469760	It's a piece of fucking plastic!
7469760	7470960	I mean, come on!
7470960	7474160	So there's no reason that this stuff is-
7474160	7475960	they're selling out of it because they can't make enough-
7475960	7479960	no, they're not making enough on purpose, so that there's not enough on the market.
7479960	7483160	So demand's always high, so people are always looking for it.
7483160	7485560	So Wii Fit's always popular, because people think,
7485560	7488360	oh my god, it's out there, but once they buy it, like I do,
7488360	7490960	you go, oh my god, I'm not using this thing.
7490960	7492560	Like Rob did.
7492560	7495360	Okay. I have an argument for it.
7495360	7497360	Okay.
7497360	7502160	Number one, we have not only strategy guides,
7502160	7507160	but we have a huge website dedicated to FAQs and walkthroughs and stuff like that.
7507160	7509960	So obviously, people are going to need help with games.
7509960	7511360	That's why those exist.
7511360	7513760	Number two, there are going to be parts of games.
7513760	7515960	Like not every part of every game is hard,
7515960	7517960	but there are going to be very hard parts.
7517960	7521160	I remember a part in Resident Evil 4 that I just could not get past,
7521160	7522760	and I wish I could have done that.
7522760	7526160	Just press a button and just gotten through that one small section of the game,
7526160	7527160	and then continued.
7527160	7532960	So, like, I personally probably would not use it to just skip through every part of the game,
7532960	7535960	but if I have a chance to get through a hard part of the game,
7535960	7537560	bring it on. I'd like it.
7537560	7543160	This has been done before, you know, not necessarily to the fact that there's stuff that you can,
7543160	7547160	you know, skip parts of the game, but Alone in the Dark, the game that came out,
7547160	7551360	unfortunately it was crap, but it came out in chapters, basically, in this game,
7551360	7555160	and you can start the game at any chapter and go from there.
7555160	7557960	So, say, oh, this is too hard, skip ahead,
7557960	7561560	and it will fill you in on what happened in the last chapter, and you just kind of go from there.
7561560	7566160	I don't, the problem is, though, is the only way you're going to get good at games
7566160	7568960	is from playing games and being challenged to think for yourself,
7568960	7571360	because if you're just sitting there going, oh, I don't get it,
7571360	7575160	and then the game solves the problem for you, you're not going to learn anything.
7575160	7576160	That is true.
7576160	7579560	And, you know, and that may turn away people from playing those games,
7579560	7584760	but you're not going to buy the game in the first place if you don't, aren't remotely interested in it.
7584760	7587760	It's like someone's spoiling the ending for, you know, a movie or something.
7587760	7593160	Like, I, you know, why is, you know, like, for example, like, The Sixth Sense or something like that,
7593160	7597360	you know, you know, why, why is it that, you know, his wife doesn't see him?
7597360	7598360	What's going on?
7598360	7599560	It's because he's dead!
7599560	7602960	You know, it's like, if someone, if someone spoiled that for you,
7602960	7606960	so that you figure out the puzzle there, it ruins it.
7606960	7607760	That's the thing.
7607760	7613760	Well, see, okay, gamers like us, regular gamers that have hand-eye coordination and all that stuff,
7613760	7616360	we're not going to want to skip over the story parts.
7616360	7618360	We're going to want to play the game as is.
7618360	7622560	But there are people who suck, just playing flat-out suck at video games.
7622560	7627360	They just can't make their character jump or whatever, you know, they can't put two and two together.
7627360	7632760	They're going to want to be kind of like a, you know how people are like spectators when it comes to video games?
7632760	7635160	They like to watch other people play a video game.
7635160	7637960	Yeah, that's going to be part of the appeal too.
7637960	7640760	They can feel like they're going through the video game themselves,
7640760	7643360	but have to skip over the hard things that they can't do.
7643360	7648360	One of the features of this game was actually watching basically the gameplay itself.
7648360	7651360	I have to say my piece, because I haven't said anything on this yet.
7651360	7652360	Do your piece.
7652360	7654360	And I haven't stated my opinion.
7654360	7658360	And you know I'm one of Nintendo's biggest critics as of like 2008 and everything.
7658360	7660360	Nintendo's kind of been pissing me off a lot lately.
7660360	7664360	That being said, I actually think this is a really good idea.
7664360	7670360	For Nintendo and its audience, I think this is a really good idea.
7670360	7675360	As long as they make a feature to turn it off and you hit the nail on the head.
7675360	7676360	Exactly what I was thinking.
7676360	7680360	This is for those people that like to watch other people play video games.
7680360	7683360	Because they're too intimidated, they don't want to really play them themselves.
7683360	7686360	Because of the fact that they feel like they suck at video games.
7686360	7688360	They can't get past these hard parts.
7688360	7689360	They want to just get past this stuff.
7689360	7694360	And I think a game like Zelda especially, that has such pretty awesome cinematics.
7694360	7696360	You know, these things that you get into.
7696360	7699360	The towns, you know, and the story behind these games.
7699360	7701360	I think it actually is going to work really well.
7701360	7704360	I kind of think about how many times that we've kind of hoped.
7704360	7707360	That there was a game like Final Fantasy X or something.
7707360	7709360	Where you could just like, I don't want to grind.
7709360	7710360	I don't want to do this dungeon.
7710360	7712360	I just want to run past all the monsters.
7712360	7715360	I want to get my, I'm going to equip the run boots on my character.
7715360	7717360	So I can just run really fast through the dungeon.
7717360	7719360	So I don't have to grind here.
7719360	7721360	Because I just want to get to the next part of the story.
7721360	7724360	Do you know how many games I've quit because I couldn't get past one certain part?
7724360	7726360	Fucking Alundra.
7726360	7728360	Oh my God, that game pissed me off.
7728360	7730360	I spent so long trying to do one puzzle.
7730360	7732360	I could just never get it, so I quit the game.
7732360	7733360	But here's the problem.
7733360	7734360	My thing though.
7734360	7735360	One other thing.
7735360	7738360	I think as we start to blur the line even more and more.
7738360	7740360	As games become more and more realistic between games and movies.
7740360	7743360	This actually kind of seems like a logical progression to me.
7743360	7747360	Is that these video games are slowly becoming Blu-ray movies in a way.
7747360	7748360	It's fascinating.
7748360	7751360	And again, for the hardcore gamers that can be a little off putting at first.
7751360	7757360	But I don't think this necessarily means that games that you and I enjoy are going to go away.
7757360	7760360	I think this is just something they're going to start in Nintendo.
7760360	7762360	And it's a very Nintendo thing to do.
7762360	7763360	It's not surprising at all.
7763360	7764360	Okay, sorry Matt.
7764360	7768360	My thing is, is that a fault of the fact that you can't finish something?
7768360	7772360	Is that a fault of the person or is that a fault of the game design?
7772360	7774360	I think it's a fault of the game design.
7774360	7777360	The fact that they made that many random battles.
7777360	7783360	You know, they tweaked it in future Final Fantasy games where there aren't that many random battles.
7783360	7786360	And they've gone back and fixed different things like that.
7786360	7788360	Because people complained about it and they listened to it.
7788360	7793360	But I don't think that necessarily, you know, it's a bad thing that there should be some difficulty in there.
7793360	7795360	Because it makes it worthwhile to figure it out.
7795360	7799360	Instead of just like, if you want to just go from story to story to story.
7799360	7801360	Seriously, go read a book. Go watch a movie.
7801360	7802360	Well, of course.
7802360	7804360	You know, but they're making it an option for you.
7804360	7806360	Like, yeah, you know, work at it.
7806360	7810360	If you really want a sense of accomplishment from beating this game, do it normal.
7810360	7812360	But for those people who don't want to, they're giving them the option to.
7812360	7816360	I just have a problem though with, you know, someone pushing a button, having the game play itself.
7816360	7817360	You know, beginning to end.
7817360	7820360	And just, what's the point?
7820360	7823360	Because here's what you can't do with a movie, Loki.
7823360	7825360	And there's going to be some people like this.
7825360	7828360	All they're going to do in a Zelda game is go around and talk to the villagers.
7828360	7831360	And then like fast forward through the action sequences and the dungeons of the game.
7831360	7834360	But they're going to feel like a part of the game.
7834360	7835360	And they feel that more emotional attachment.
7835360	7836360	More interactive.
7836360	7839360	Because it was more interactive and they just walked around and talked to villagers.
7839360	7840360	And that's all they ever did.
7840360	7842360	And they're going to be like, this is the greatest game I've ever played.
7842360	7844360	And you know what's also awesome about that?
7844360	7848360	The fact that they're going to be done with the game now and they have to buy something else.
7848360	7850360	Because that's what Nintendo wants to do.
7850360	7851360	That's their own choice.
7851360	7852360	That's their prerogative.
7852360	7853360	They can do that if they want to.
7853360	7854360	If they want to spend their money.
7854360	7859360	And you can go on to TheMovieSpoiler.net and look at the ending to all your movies without having to pay $100.
7859360	7860360	Alright, fine.
7860360	7861360	Or whatever it's called.
7861360	7862360	I'm going to say this here and now.
7862360	7865360	This game, whenever it does come out with this feature, I'm not buying it.
7865360	7866360	I'm sorry.
7866360	7868360	This feature right here ruined it for me.
7868360	7871360	And the fact that they're putting it in this game, I am not buying this game.
7871360	7872360	Even though it's optional?
7872360	7873360	Even if it's optional.
7873360	7874360	I don't give a shit.
7874360	7875360	I'm not buying it.
7875360	7876360	Because you know what?
7876360	7882360	If they want to design a game that's more appealing to the casual audience, they need to design that game for the casual audience.
7882360	7885360	It's just like the EA Sports games that they put out.
7885360	7889360	The really stupid, easy, you can play them with the remote.
7889360	7894360	They're really stripped down versions of the game because people can't figure out the complex controls.
7894360	7895360	Well I'm sorry.
7895360	7896360	You know what?
7896360	7900360	There have been plenty of kids, plenty of people that have figured out the Xbox controllers.
7900360	7902360	Figured out the Playstation 2 controllers.
7902360	7903360	I'd like to meet them.
7903360	7905360	Figured out how to use the Wii remote.
7905360	7907360	There's people that still don't know how to use the Wii remote.
7907360	7912360	Unless you come out with a game that's a fucking controller that's a big giant button that says,
7912360	7913360	Push me.
7913360	7915360	And even then they're not going to figure it out.
7915360	7918360	They're going to throw it on the floor and go, I don't know how to play this.
7918360	7920360	These people do not need to be playing games.
7920360	7922360	And I don't care if you want to introduce them in the games.
7922360	7926360	They think they need to be playing games but they do not need to be playing games.
7926360	7929360	And keep them away from my goddamn games.
7929360	7933360	Do you care to make a wager on how much this game will sell?
7933360	7936360	No, I am not making a wager.
7936360	7941360	Because it will be a Zelda game and some will be like, Oh my god, Zelda, go buy it.
7941360	7944360	Even if it's crap, it could be Zelda Cribbage or something.
7944360	7947360	And they'll be like, Oh my god, I got to buy this, it's Zelda.
7947360	7950360	Oh my god, Zelda and they have stuff in it.
7950360	7954360	The chat room is setting off the Loki rant alarm.
7954360	7958360	Goldanthro in chat says, Wii 2.0, push me.
7958360	7962360	Rice Princess.
7962360	7970360	Oh no, I was just going to say, the way I see it, I liken it to having an easy, normal, and hard mode in a game.
7970360	7974360	There's going to be like, dumb fuck mode.
7974360	7977360	Don't know how to do anything in the game, just going to watch it play itself.
7977360	7978360	Whatever, you know.
7978360	7979360	Just another mode.
7979360	7980360	I'm not surprised.
7980360	7981360	It's the Wii.
7981360	7982360	You know, great.
7982360	7984360	They're going to have this feature, but I bet you anything they're going to be able to turn it off.
7984360	7985360	And you know why?
7985360	7986360	Because that's a feature.
7986360	7989360	And Nintendo doesn't add features that people want.
7989360	7992360	Okay, we're getting back into that, Matt.
7992360	7994360	We don't need to have that argument on this show.
7994360	7995360	No, seriously.
7995360	7997360	They're not going to have it.
7997360	7998360	Ah, whatever.
7998360	7999360	I'm done.
7999360	8001360	There's a second half to this I want Loki to get into.
8001360	8003360	Yes, there's a second half.
8003360	8008360	Apparently, the game developers were asked to kind of comment on this.
8008360	8010360	And they have different things.
8010360	8016360	For example, Ben Matz from Ubisoft, he was saying, you know, he read through it quickly.
8016360	8021360	Not surely they fully understand what it is yet.
8021360	8028360	But it says it makes sense to them in a purely linear game, but as soon as they get to sort of like a sandbox game,
8028360	8036360	or an evenly or remotely open-ended game, the number of variables would seem to invalidate the potential of this system.
8036360	8041360	But I think he's talking about something that would actually play through the game for you or something like that.
8041360	8045360	But Ubisoft just put out a game that definitely had easy mode on.
8045360	8047360	You don't die in Prince of Persia, ever.
8047360	8048360	Yeah.
8048360	8053360	It's kind of interesting because Ubisoft kind of already started going this direction where, you know, you don't die.
8053360	8055360	The chick always saves you.
8055360	8059360	And in every battle, at least that I've played so far, it pretty much tells you how to fight it.
8059360	8061360	And you just press buttons and it does cool stuff.
8061360	8063360	But, like, it's not a bad game.
8063360	8064360	It's really not.
8064360	8067360	I have a lot of fun with the new Prince of Persia.
8067360	8068360	Can I read this in chat real quick?
8068360	8069360	Yeah.
8069360	8070360	I'm sorry, this is too good.
8070360	8073360	GS68 says, I guess talking about, you know, getting irritated at games,
8073360	8074360	My face turns beet red.
8074360	8076360	I throw my controller on the ground, start swearing.
8076360	8077360	Fucking game.
8077360	8078360	Long chains.
8078360	8080360	Swear to never play a shooting game again.
8080360	8082360	And then SakuraMax follows up and says,
8082360	8087360	And then you throw a taco at someone.
8087360	8094360	Todd Howard from Bethesda says that, you know, most people stop playing certain games because they get frustrated or confused by what the game wants them to do.
8094360	8097360	It becomes work and frustration as opposed to play time.
8097360	8101360	This idea clearly tries to alleviate that.
8101360	8107360	It's much like passing the controller to someone that knows the game really well so that you can move ahead or simply enjoy the story.
8107360	8115360	It's a classic challenge or entertain issue that designers will often deal with.
8115360	8117360	Yeah.
8117360	8119360	And then finally, let's see here.
8119360	8123360	Jonathan Blow from the creator of Braid says,
8123360	8125360	Based on just reading your posting, I don't know.
8125360	8131360	I mean, it's an okay idea for a developer to have a way to show you through various parts of the game, I guess.
8131360	8134360	To show you the side quests that you missed or whatever.
8134360	8136360	I'd like to see someone try that.
8136360	8143360	But as a general, what was it, paradigm for playing games, there are a lot of problems.
8143360	8146360	The defining characteristics of a game is that you play it.
8146360	8155360	And if in order for games to be accessible to a wide audience, we need to make sure that so that most people can skip over the playing part of it,
8155360	8163360	then what that really means is that our medium sucks.
8163360	8175360	And if you have to elude the basic property of your medium to make experiences in the medium desirable, then the medium itself is questionable at a very deep level.
8175360	8181360	Apparently our stream went down for the live listeners. The podcast listeners won't notice the thing because we've been recording the whole time.
8181360	8183360	But our stream went down in the middle of you reading that.
8183360	8187360	Like, I don't know what's going on tonight. There's some weird things with our internet stream.
8187360	8192360	But somebody in the chat room had to say, who threw a taco at the stream?
8192360	8197360	Sorry, that's never going to get old. I'm sorry to derail the other thing you're talking about.
8197360	8204360	The live listeners didn't even hear what you were just saying, which is unfortunate, but kind of some varied opinions from developers.
8204360	8210360	Yeah. I mean, definitely it's all over the place, but I think it's something that's only going to be used in Nintendo games anyway.
8210360	8212360	It's not something that they're requiring, I don't think.
8212360	8217360	I wonder if any of these developers are secretly already working on something for this new system. That's what I'm curious about.
8217360	8218360	I doubt it.
8218360	8220360	Do you think this is a Nintendo-only thing?
8220360	8224360	I think this is something they're going to push, and it's probably going to be in one game, and I don't think you'll see it ever again.
8224360	8235360	I really don't think... I mean, honestly, with this in here, the problem is that we're expecting this to be implemented in a Zelda game.
8235360	8241360	And really, are you going to be able to tell what kind of an impact this had on a Zelda game?
8241360	8245360	I mean, this is a title that's going to sell like crazy anyways.
8245360	8251360	I mean, I would think that they would want this something on, you know, something that doesn't sell very well.
8251360	8253360	Like, even Mario Galaxy didn't sell that well.
8253360	8259360	You know, maybe something like that is where we can see an actual impact on this, but with a Zelda, it's just going to sell like crazy and be like,
8259360	8262360	Oh, it worked! You know, I mean, it's just stupid.
8262360	8265360	I don't know. I don't think it's...
8265360	8272360	They're just going to sell tons of copies anyways, because people are dumb, and they'll buy whatever people tell them is good.
8272360	8280360	And Zelda is going to get tens out of ten, because there's fanboys out there that are reviewing that stuff.
8280360	8286360	And even though Twilight Princess, in my opinion, I don't think that's a ten out of ten game, or not even a nine out of ten game.
8286360	8289360	It was okay. It was the first Zelda game.
8289360	8295360	Actually, the GameCube one, or not the GameCube, the Nintendo 64 ones, I didn't care for too much either.
8295360	8306360	I just was not interested. It just didn't hold my interest, and that's sad, because I'm really interested in Zelda games.
8306360	8310360	Yeah, but they don't have an objective perspective on the game.
8310360	8312360	Yeah, I think that's it. Perfectly.
8312360	8315360	You know, there's going to be like, Grand Theft Auto. Oh, ten out of ten.
8315360	8317360	You know, Gears of War. Ten out of ten!
8317360	8319360	Yeah, they don't even have to work on a hit anymore. It's guaranteed.
8319360	8324360	I mean, that's what you do. You build up a franchise, and you get to the point where it's like, you know, you can do whatever, and people are still going to buy it.
8324360	8325360	I don't know.
8325360	8326360	It's huge.
8326360	8329360	I'm really curious to see what the listeners think of all this casual stuff.
8329360	8335360	I haven't seen a whole lot in chat, probably because the stream went down, but I will hopefully see some emails later on.
8335360	8339360	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, you know, for next week or something would be great.
8339360	8343360	We will get into tonight's mailbag. Well, how about right now?
8343360	8344360	Want to open up the mailbag?
8344360	8345360	Well, alright then.
8345360	8347360	Check out some emails from the listeners.
8347360	8348360	Sure!
8348360	8359360	Every week we invite you to send us emails at Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com, and usually DarkSakura opens up the mailbag and reads the emails.
8359360	8362360	However, she's not here tonight, so I am filling in.
8362360	8367360	And we actually have quite a few emails tonight, so I want to try and get through these as fast as I can.
8367360	8370360	Let's read this first email. It's from Chaz.
8370360	8379360	Hey, OLR gang. I'm a long-time listener of the show, but it's my first time writing in. I listen to you all every Monday at my desk while hard at work here in the frozen tundra known as Chicago.
8379360	8384360	I listen to a lot of the other video game podcasts out there, and OLR is by far the best. Well, thank you.
8384360	8389360	I don't really have much to say in the way of video games today, but consider this my love letter to the show.
8389360	8391360	How hard does OLR rock? Let me count the ways.
8391360	8395360	Number three, real gamers with real opinions. Nothing commercial here.
8395360	8396360	Thank you, that's one of the things we pride ourselves on.
8396360	8401360	Yeah, we're definitely not commercial based on the comments and crap that we've-
8401360	8402360	Brought to you by Nintendo.
8402360	8405360	By the way, have you checked out Game Tap this week? No, just kidding.
8405360	8411360	Number two, awesome segments. Classic Game of the Week and Fus of the Week rock my world. Well, thank you.
8411360	8419360	Number one, good friends with great chemistry. Loki with his blistering honesty, Jamie's hilarious interludes, and Rob's fun-loving and sincere take on gaming culture.
8419360	8423360	These are just a few of the reasons I am and will continue to be an OLR fanboy.
8423360	8427360	Also, on a personal note, I'd like to give a special shout out to Rob.
8427360	8429360	You think I'd pay this guy to write-
8429360	8431360	Yeah, you wrote this to yourself.
8431360	8433360	No, come over here and read it for sure.
8433360	8439360	I think it's so great and so important to have an openly gay gamer's voice being heard in the community.
8439360	8451360	As a gay man myself, you know as well as I do how severely underrepresented and occasionally maligned gay sexuality has been portrayed through the games we've played and how rampant homophobia continues to be in the online gaming sphere.
8451360	8459360	Thanks for letting listeners know your stand on these issues. It means a lot to me and also to those who are unable for whatever reason to speak up for themselves. Keep up the great work.
8459360	8461360	Ooh, is he single?
8461360	8463360	And not a minor?
8463360	8465360	Shush. Shush.
8465360	8467360	No, that was very nice.
8467360	8473360	You know, it's letters like those that make me feel good about doing this show for free for seven years, honestly.
8473360	8475360	Oh, tear, tear.
8475360	8486360	You know, when Wendy says it's right, it's tough. It's really tough sometimes because, you know, the nice thing is being gay is getting more and more accepted. We're getting there.
8486360	8491360	You know, even though Prop 8 in California didn't pass, it was just- I know, I know, Victoria, don't get me started.
8491360	8497360	It was a very slim margin compared to Prop 22 of several years ago. We're getting there.
8497360	8500360	You know, more and more, especially in the youth, no more gay people, what have you.
8500360	8506360	But it's funny because in the gay world, it's like, oh, you play video games? That's like a kid thing.
8506360	8511360	You know, why don't you listen to Madonna or do fashion shows? Like seriously, you know, like it's hard.
8511360	8520360	Like there was a long time where I didn't feel comfortable when I met guys for the first time, like telling them, yeah, I do an online radio show about video games on the weekends because it's like, whoa, nerd alert.
8520360	8522360	But now I don't give a shit.
8522360	8535360	I'm to that point where I've kind of seen there's enough out there that, you know, there's people out there that are going to like me for both elements, if that makes sense.
8535360	8538360	Anyhow, I don't want to get too into it.
8538360	8539360	We can relate to you, Rott.
8539360	8540360	How so?
8540360	8551360	Because girl and girl gamers. I mean, like, you know, a lot of them are kind of, I guess, not really tomboyish, but they kind of shun like female convention.
8551360	8556360	You know, they're not all of them are bottle blondes that get their nails done every day and wear a lot of makeup.
8556360	8558360	So it's kind of the same.
8558360	8559360	Interesting perspective.
8559360	8560360	Yeah, true.
8560360	8561360	True.
8561360	8563360	All right, let's get to another email.
8563360	8569360	And OK, this kind of ties into a story we reported on earlier, but obviously we weren't here last week.
8569360	8570360	Spazinator writes in.
8570360	8575360	Hey, everyone, I thought I'd email you folks about some news that I received the other day that you might want to share.
8575360	8583360	I have heard via both one up dot com green speak dot com and G4 that Ziff Davis has sold the one up network at sites along with EGM to UGO.
8583360	8587360	Not to be confused with Yu-Gi-Oh for some undisclosed sum.
8587360	8589360	Subsequently, UGO is fine.
8589360	8597360	Now I want to say Yu-Gi-Oh has fired approximately 30 one up employees, including some of the more well-known popularity and popular personalities.
8597360	8599360	Additionally, EGM has been officially killed off.
8599360	8606360	And although no one mentioned specifically, it looks like the audio and video podcasts have been axed as well, including one up FM, Retronauts and so on and so on.
8606360	8611360	On a personal note, I really feel bad for those that got the ax earlier this week are the ones I recognize.
8611360	8618360	I know they produce top notch material, whether it be for the sites, podcasts or the magazines, and inject their own personality into said material to keep it from going stale.
8618360	8619360	I hope for the best for them.
8619360	8626360	But given the particularly craptastic economy as of late, I'm afraid there's the potential they may leave the video games journalism biz.
8626360	8628360	If that's the case, the industry would suffer a great loss.
8628360	8632360	Additionally, it really sickens me that they killed off EGM, a long as hell running magazine.
8632360	8637360	Isn't it bad enough that OPM was killed in 06 and game for Windows earlier this year?
8637360	8640360	I mean, come on, websites are fine and dandy, but magazines still have a place though.
8640360	8644360	Case in point, which would you rather bring to the can, a mag or a laptop?
8644360	8645360	Or worse, yes, a desktop.
8645360	8647360	Wow, it's like this guy read my mind from earlier.
8647360	8648360	That's amazing.
8648360	8654360	Not only that, but for some people such as myself, we like the feel of holding a mag in our hands.
8654360	8657360	While you're in the bathroom, you talk about holding things in your hands.
8657360	8659360	And you know what, if you run out of toilet paper...
8659360	8660360	Shut up, shut up.
8660360	8666360	And sometimes you even like to achieve or collect if you prefer the mags, especially if the magazine is a particularly good publication.
8666360	8676360	Hell, I still have every single solitary issue of OPM, original PlayStation magazine, all 112 and every single issue of EGM since my OPM subscription rolled over to EGM.
8676360	8678360	I was wondering, what are your opinions on this?
8678360	8685360	I know that based on user generated comments on various sites, blogs, et cetera, that most people are uber pissed and vowed never to visit 1up.com again.
8685360	8689360	Additionally, what other podcast websites and mags would you recommend to fill the void?
8689360	8696360	Honestly, I want to avoid GameSpot because of their reputation and credibility has been severely tarnished early last year over that army of two firing debacle.
8696360	8699360	Thank you for the email.
8699360	8701360	Obviously, we talked about this a little bit earlier in the show.
8701360	8709360	But the point that he brought up that I thought was interesting was that last paragraph was based on everybody complaining, they vowing never to visit 1up.com and all this stuff again.
8709360	8717360	But here's the thing, EGM has really gone through a lot of changes since the beginning. Do a lot of people that worked there in the first couple of years work there now?
8717360	8723360	Very, very few. And I know that because most of the people working at 1up.com were in their early 30s or late 20s.
8723360	8727360	So they would have been like teenagers when the magazines first came out.
8727360	8733360	So these magazines have already changed the guards a few times.
8733360	8745360	So my question back to you guys is, yes, these guys integrated their personalities into the show and everything, which in turn probably ended up being bad for 1up.com because this would have never happened had they never had those podcasts.
8745360	8750360	Think about it. If they never had those podcasts, if they never built up that personality, it's kind of like a double edged sword.
8750360	8754360	It probably really helped sell their site. But at the same time, now they're having to deal with this.
8754360	8759360	What if you'd never really gotten to know those writers as well as you did? Would you have cared so much about this news?
8759360	8769360	Kind of interesting. Because I bet this kind of stuff has happened before. You didn't care because you didn't feel that connection to them from reading their Twitters, looking at their podcasts, so on and so on.
8769360	8774360	So kind of interesting.
8774360	8784360	As far as what to recommend to fill the void, I've said this before and I've said it again. There's hundreds of people out there, almost thousands, that do stuff like we do for free every week.
8784360	8789360	This kind of stuff. Because we love video games too, even though it doesn't sound like it sometimes because we get ranty and things like that.
8789360	8798360	It's just because we hate because we love. There's other independent podcasts that are great and awesome that you can tune out there and listen to.
8798360	8805360	There's tons of networks. If you don't know where to begin, look for some of the networks that have come together, such as AllGames.com.
8805360	8815360	There's what? Gamercast network, I think they're called. Especially if you like Xbox. They have a lot of Xbox centric shows over there. Look for some of the networks of shows.
8815360	8825360	Because that's kind of what OneUp was, was a network, except it was a little different because they were all still produced in house. Whereas I think in the case of AllGames, Gamercast, and whatever other networks you can think of.
8825360	8835360	What's the other one? Platform Nation I think is another one. Is Evil Avatar a network? I don't know off the top of my head.
8835360	8843360	I think the difference is that OneUp produced all those in house. Everybody produces their own little silo show and they come together on these networks.
8843360	8850360	There's lots of people that love games that would love to talk about them with you out there on the internets.
8850360	8858360	And obviously if you still feel connected to the OneUp guys, it sounds like they're doing their own show. So maybe it'll last for them. We'll see.
8858360	8873360	Alright. I said them right? I don't remember. I think so. Okay. By the way, just for the live listeners only, and I apologize I'm too lazy to edit this kind of stuff out of the podcast.
8873360	8880360	Apparently the stream is skipping now. It sounds like a CD that's skipping or something. That's not on our end guys. I don't know what's going on.
8880360	8887360	I have had cable issues. I did not get to go to a WoW raid on Thursday because of Comcast cable issues.
8887360	8888360	Yeah, they've been suckers.
8888360	8891360	God forbid you miss your story of the castle.
8891360	8901360	For real. For real. And by the way, it was the dragon battle, Malygos, that I missed. And I was the only one attuned for it, so the whole guild didn't get to go because I couldn't sign on because of Comcast.
8901360	8909360	So it was big drama. Big drama. But anyway, I don't know what's going on. I don't know if it's us. I don't know if it's the server. Something's up.
8909360	8916360	But the podcast will be up in its entirety along with last week's podcast this week on the stream. Promise?
8916360	8920360	More emails, except I just closed the mailbag. Whoops.
8920360	8922360	Way to go, Rod.
8922360	8927360	Sorry about that. Anything else you guys want to say on that last email? About other places to go?
8927360	8929360	I don't think you touched anything.
8929360	8941360	All right. GS68 emails us. Hey, OLR crew, it's GS68. So I've gotten to play my DJ Max Technica some more, thanks to me taking advantage of my winter break to go to Spiggle regularly. That's Sunnyvale Golf Land.
8941360	8946360	For those not familiar with Technica, the game goes like this. One half of the screen is filled with stationary notes and a line passes over them.
8946360	8955360	As the line does, you touch the notes to recreate parts of the music. Sometimes you get special notes, such as blue notes that you hold down, green and yellow notes that you drag along, and purple notes that you press repeatedly.
8955360	8959360	When the line reaches the end, it continues on the other half of the screen.
8959360	8968360	I feel that this game is the right step for the rhythm game genre. There's always two to three people waiting to play the game at Sunnyvale Golf Land, which shows that Technica just might keep arcades going somewhat longer.
8968360	8975360	I doubt it. I hate to be the pessimist, but one game ain't gonna happen. But I appreciate your enthusiasm.
8975360	8987360	The touch screen in the EBA meets luminous gameplay allows for more freedom of movement and play styles, as opposed to, say, BeatMania 2DX or DDR. I've seen players use one hand, both hands, one or two fingers, all of their fingers, and so on.
8987360	8998360	It does have some flaws, though. Scoring and grades are combo-based, and if I've learned anything from EBA and Ohndon, it's that combo-based scoring is retarded, as where you screw up has a big impact on your score.
8998360	9014360	Also, the life meter is fairly strict. Though it falls to just as much as, say, DDR or other DJMax games, it takes forever to recover your life gauge, which is a problem in technical mode, where you need to be above a certain amount of life to get to the next stage, not unlike 2DX or Pop'n Music's regular modes.
9014360	9024360	And of course, being a touch-to-the-notes game as opposed to hit notes as they pass a redline game, it's harder to sight-read a song. I've seen otherwise good players fail a song because of the offbeat notes.
9024360	9030360	Songs that are faster tend to be also harder than slow songs because the notes are more spaced out and you have less time to survey the notes.
9030360	9041360	I'm hoping something good comes out of having a card. I have one myself, and so far it's only apparent features or modifiers, which you use max points on, and Platinum Crew mode, which is some sort of online mode I'll discuss later when it's activated.
9041360	9045360	Also, our machine is looking to get an update in a few days. Hopefully we'll get some new songs about it.
9045360	9054360	Also a minor but nice touch, there's a headphone jack below the touchscreen if it's hard to hear the game. Using headphones can help. Take care, maybe I'll see some of you at Spiggle.
9054360	9060360	P.S. this email was brought to you by Beatrock3 from Pop'n Music, home of the never-ending Falling Books.
9060360	9062360	So there you go.
9062360	9067360	It sounds interesting. I want to try this touch game. It sounds interesting.
9067360	9068360	Go to Spiggle.
9068360	9077360	I actually am supposed to be in South Bay February 7th anyway, and I'm taking Victoria with me, so maybe I'll take Victoria to the arcade because we have Rocky in the South Bay on the 7th.
9077360	9083360	So maybe we can swing by and check out this game. Don't you want to go play video games, Victoria?
9083360	9085360	OMG, totally.
9085360	9089360	Alright, she just rolled her eyes. You don't want to play DDR, Victoria?
9089360	9098360	I'm an epic fail at DDR, my fat ass on the damn thing, I'm like on easy, I'm like oh girl, oh girl, I need a break.
9098360	9100360	You can play pinball or something that's less stressful.
9100360	9101360	Holla.
9101360	9102360	Alright.
9102360	9106360	Also Victoria's ass is not fat, it's just round.
9106360	9111360	I like big butts and I cannot lie. Actually I don't think Victoria's fat, but whatever.
9111360	9115360	No, she's not at all. She's beautiful and single.
9115360	9118360	Stop trying to pimp me, Irene.
9118360	9121360	I'm not at all.
9121360	9128360	Um, let me read another email here from R.J.
9128360	9131360	Because I don't see another signature here, so I'm just going to say R.J.
9131360	9136360	Hey OLR, I'm using my lovely eye touch to send this email, so be warned Jamie if the Grammar Nazi bar is high.
9136360	9140360	You lucked out, you read me tonight and I have terrible grammar so I don't judge the others.
9140360	9144360	I've just finished Infinite Undiscovery and Lost Odyssey and I'm planning on getting The Last Remnant next,
9144360	9149360	which I've heard is a slightly generic story but a robust and interesting battle system, so I'll tell you what I've experienced next time.
9149360	9154360	Now as Rob said countless times, the beginning in Infinite Undiscovery was annoying, but the ogre part lasts not even an hour,
9154360	9159360	and after that the game's gameplay and story will always leave you wanting to keep continuing with it,
9159360	9162360	even if the English voiceover for some of the characters are dreadful.
9162360	9168360	That's the opposite case of Lost Odyssey, which has some of the best English voiceover in years, especially Janssen.
9168360	9173360	The bad point for Lost Odyssey is the boring turn-based gameplay which brings nothing new at all to the table.
9173360	9177360	Nevertheless, both leave you satisfied at the end and don't suffer from rehashed plot points.
9177360	9184360	If you wish story is better, I'm sorry, which story is better, Lost Odyssey is and has superb presentation.
9184360	9191360	With Infinite Undiscovery gameplay, in my opinion, fun yet repetitive at parts. Don't hesitate on getting either.
9191360	9196360	So interesting because I gave up on Infinite Undiscovery because the beginning is terrible.
9196360	9197360	Really?
9197360	9200360	Oh, but I even got past that ogre part he's talking about.
9200360	9205360	No, maybe because I got into like the really dark forest and that part annoyed me too and whatever.
9205360	9206360	I'll go back to it someday.
9206360	9209360	Too bad you didn't have a button to just pass.
9209360	9214360	For real. For real. Thank you. Seriously? Seriously, I would have hit the button on that game.
9214360	9215360	For serious, yeah.
9215360	9216360	I would have. For real.
9216360	9218360	Yeah. For realsies.
9218360	9223360	And it's signed P.S. Rob. Queen was the better 70s band than ABBA.
9223360	9226360	I love Queen. Queen is amazing.
9226360	9229360	Queen is amazing. Queen Mercury was...
9229360	9230360	I know. Freddie Mercury is a god.
9230360	9231360	I would love to be his head. Oh my god.
9231360	9233360	Freddie Mercury was a god, really.
9233360	9238360	But, I'm sorry, ABBA's still number one. But Queen is like seriously two or three. Seriously.
9238360	9239360	Two or maybe three.
9239360	9241360	Maybe two or three. Because Bowie's kind of, you know.
9241360	9246360	Oh, from Labyrinth. He's awesome.
9246360	9247360	There you go. That's my thoughts on that.
9247360	9252360	And just a couple more here. Sorry, I know we have a lot of emails tonight, but that's alright.
9252360	9253360	We don't have a lot of...
9253360	9258360	This one's for Fart Princess, which we haven't called her that tonight, but Fart Princess.
9258360	9263360	No, since Rice or Fart Princess, which, by the way, can I say this about Fart Princess real quick?
9263360	9264360	I was on WoW last night.
9264360	9266360	Okay, do you have to bring this up?
9266360	9267360	Boo!
9267360	9268360	Thank you.
9268360	9272360	And for an hour, she was talking about farts and guilt chat.
9272360	9275360	It was not an hour. It was like five minutes.
9275360	9276360	It felt like an hour.
9276360	9278360	It was incidental, okay?
9278360	9281360	She talked to you. You were talking about farts for an hour.
9281360	9286360	And Vlad kept talking to me, okay? So, obviously, someone was interested in what I had to say.
9286360	9291360	Since Rice Princess is here tonight, this is from Amaze Satsuma, I'll go ahead and ask,
9291360	9294360	how did you all like the latest Battlestar Galactica episode?
9294360	9295360	Oh my god!
9295360	9300360	We all know the BSG talk is in, was going to happen sooner or later with her here,
9300360	9302360	so I thought I'd give it a helping hand.
9302360	9305360	No spoilers. I haven't watched it yet because I'm still on season three.
9305360	9310360	This doesn't spoil anything, but I am depressed beyond belief.
9310360	9315360	I want to elaborate more, but I can't because then I'll start getting into the spoilers.
9315360	9319360	But, oh man, I absolutely want to keep watching.
9319360	9323360	They know how to make people keep coming back and wanting more.
9323360	9327360	And this is just, yeah, but better.
9327360	9332360	I did hear, because it was inadvertently spoiled for me, that now the last Cylon has been revealed, right?
9332360	9333360	You here tell correct.
9333360	9335360	Was it shocking?
9335360	9338360	I thought it was stupid.
9338360	9343360	I hope that's not a spoiler, but I'm hoping that it wasn't an actual revelation of the final Cylon,
9343360	9349360	that it was just speculation on behalf of one of the characters in the show.
9349360	9354360	But, I don't know, I think it pretty much is confirmation that it is the last Cylon,
9354360	9357360	but if that is the last Cylon, I'll be upset.
9357360	9358360	Alright.
9358360	9359360	That's all I have to say.
9359360	9360360	Yeah.
9360360	9361360	Okay.
9361360	9362360	That's enough. We won't say any more.
9362360	9364360	Okay. No BSG.
9364360	9365360	Alright.
9365360	9371360	One other email from our old buddy DMN who wants to update you on the March Madness competition that's going on.
9371360	9374360	Remember, this is the controversial one last year where Super Metroid beat Chrono Trigger,
9374360	9376360	and I got hate mail for a year because of it?
9376360	9378360	Yeah, as deserved.
9378360	9382360	Here is your chance to write what has been wronged.
9382360	9388360	You can send your top 25 to Bresloll, I guess is his name.
9388360	9391360	But there's a specific email address you actually want to send those to.
9391360	9393360	I know it's a Gmail address.
9393360	9394360	Let me look it up real quick.
9394360	9396360	And this is the last week to do so, by the way.
9396360	9397360	There's like six days left.
9397360	9401360	uslmadness, all one word, at gmail.com.
9401360	9405360	You want to send those into Bresloll as fast as you can because you only have six days left.
9405360	9407360	Here's the rundown of the top 25 so far.
9407360	9413360	Keep in mind, this is only determining the seeds for the head-to-head competitions that will happen later on.
9413360	9416360	This is not the end right now.
9416360	9418360	Number 25, Paper Mario.

9445360	9447360	8, Dance Dance Revolution.
9447360	9449360	7, Super Metroid.
9449360	9453360	At 7, excuse me, excuse me.
9453360	9456360	Number 6, Super Mario 3.
9456360	9459360	Number 5, Final Fantasy VI.
9459360	9461360	Number 4, The Ocarina of Time.
9461360	9463360	Number 3, Link to the Past.
9463360	9466360	Number 2, Chrono Trigger.
9466360	9468360	Yeah, that's right, bitch.
9468360	9470360	Like five places up.
9470360	9475360	And the current number one game of all time, according to the people who have emailed.
9475360	9476360	Big Rigs.
9476360	9477360	No.
9477360	9478360	Just kidding.
9478360	9480360	Rock Band is the number one game of all time.
9480360	9485360	If you consider that music game fans, you know, is our roots, I'm not surprised.
9485360	9491360	But, if you disagree, here's your chance to send in your list to make Super Metroid number one so it gets a little higher.
9491360	9493360	Why the fuck is Pokemon on there?
9493360	9494360	Alright.
9494360	9495360	I don't like Pokemon.
9495360	9496360	So there you go.
9496360	9499360	If you disagree, again, get those lists in, you have six days left.
9499360	9500360	That's it.
9500360	9501360	Okay, thanks Rob.
9501360	9502360	Because they're closing the polls.
9502360	9503360	So, are you going to send in a list?
9503360	9504360	Your top 25 of all time?
9504360	9505360	Probably not.
9505360	9507360	I already know my, I'm secure in my decision.
9507360	9509360	My top five games of all time.
9509360	9510360	Alright.
9510360	9511360	I don't need to, like, validate it.
9511360	9512360	Alright.
9512360	9513360	Just stuck up, bitch.
9513360	9514360	Alright.
9514360	9515360	That's going to do it for the emails.
9515360	9520360	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com if you'd like to send your own email in for read, for
9520360	9521360	reading?
9521360	9522360	Red read?
9522360	9523360	I don't know, Rob.
9523360	9524360	To read on the air next week.
9524360	9525360	Speak English.
9525360	9526360	Thank God Jamie's not here.
9526360	9527360	I would have just got a fail award.
9527360	9528360	Yeah.
9528360	9529360	She would have thrown a taco at you.
9529360	9533360	Back to some gaming news, and then we're going to take some calls on the Skype line at 1877.
9533360	9536360	You mean Victoria's going to take a call?
9536360	9537360	1877 Game OLR.
9537360	9538360	In a little bit.
9538360	9540360	We still have some stories.
9540360	9541360	Loki.
9541360	9547360	This week on Xbox Live Arcade, we'll be getting the brand new game, The Maw.
9547360	9550360	The Maw is being put out by TwistedPixels.
9550360	9556360	It's an adventure platformer that places you in the role of Frank, an alien stranded on
9556360	9561360	a strange planet with The Maw, a strange blob-like creature that acts like his only friend and
9561360	9566360	ultimate weapon all at the same time.
9566360	9569360	Let's see, it will be available for 800 Microsoft points.
9569360	9575360	We'll be out on the 21st, and if I remember correctly, I think The Maw was a winner of
9575360	9580360	some award during PAX, but I can't remember what it was.
9580360	9581360	Oh well.
9581360	9584360	Was it one of those indie games that was featured in the center?
9584360	9585360	Yes, it was.
9585360	9587360	I remember hearing about that.
9587360	9588360	That's cool.
9588360	9589360	Very neat.
9589360	9590360	Awesome.
9590360	9594360	Fable 2, which I'm finally going to get a chance to play this week, because Loki helped
9594360	9597360	me get hooked up with a copy of Fable 2, so I'm going to check that out this week, and
9597360	9600360	I know this is a game that, like, Dark Soccer has been playing a lot.
9600360	9604360	I haven't seen her on Xbox Live a lot until this game came out, and apparently she's been
9604360	9608360	playing with, like, OLR people and stuff, so I'm going to get on there and finally get
9608360	9609360	to play some Fable 2.
9609360	9610360	You're not a big fan?
9610360	9611360	It's okay.
9611360	9614360	I actually have to go back and play because I want to finish it.
9614360	9615360	It's short.
9615360	9620360	I'm thinking about getting the download content, though, for it, then I can start Fallout 3.
9620360	9621360	Or maybe Lost Aussie.
9621360	9623360	I may have to go back to Lost Aussie.
9623360	9624860	Well, I think I'm going to check out Fable 2.
9624860	9630360	I might even play it tonight and force Victoria to watch some of it with me, but we'll see.
9630360	9632360	Victoria, I just caught Victoria's attention.
9632360	9633360	I'm going to play some Fable 2 tonight.
9633360	9635360	It's a video game.
9635360	9637360	She's going yippee.
9637360	9638360	You'll have my laptop.
9638360	9640360	You can chat with your hoes on AOL.
9640360	9641360	You'll be fine.
9641360	9647360	You can marry people of the same sex or, like, have multiple husbands and wives and babies.
9647360	9651360	Well, I've been watching Sauce, you know, or Tiara, whatever you want to call her.
9651360	9652360	She's been on this show a couple times.
9652360	9655360	I've been watching her tweets that have been updating us on the progress of her.
9655360	9657360	It sounds like she's having a lot of fun.
9657360	9661360	I think she has two husbands and a wife and a child named Optimus Prime.
9661360	9664360	So I want to check this out.
9664360	9670360	So anyhow, speaking of Fable 2, the download content, not whole island, finally came out.
9670360	9675360	Apparently, there's a weapon in it called Howl's Rifle.
9675360	9680360	The funny thing about it, it looks exactly like the assault rifle from Halo.
9680360	9681360	Get it?
9681360	9682360	Howl?
9682360	9683360	Halo?
9683360	9688360	59 damage per shot, 24 shots per clip, and has an empty augment slot.
9688360	9692360	So basically, they kind of made a little Halo lol joke in the download content.
9692360	9693360	Halo.
9693360	9694360	Halo.
9694360	9695360	Wow.
9695360	9696360	Nice.
9696360	9700360	Redtertainment says, Sky, why are you forcing Victoria to do things?
9700360	9701360	What is she, your girlfriend?
9701360	9703360	No, but kind of.
9703360	9705360	I mean, she's like one of my hags.
9705360	9707360	So, and she has to crash here all weekend.
9707360	9710360	So I've got, I've got two of my hags here tonight.
9710360	9711360	I'm very special.
9711360	9715360	It's the least I could do for letting, you know, him letting me stay here and not sleep
9715360	9716360	in my car.
9716360	9719360	It's the least that she can do as his hag.
9719360	9722360	We have hag duties, you know, that we have to do.
9722360	9724360	And this is some of it.
9724360	9725360	What did it say?
9725360	9728360	If the hag, if the hag don't like you, the fag.
9728360	9730360	If the hag hates you, the fag don't date you.
9730360	9732360	But that goes the other way around too.
9732360	9733360	Yep.
9733360	9734360	It does go there.
9734360	9736360	Like I have to approve of anyone Victoria or Irene dates.
9736360	9737360	This is true.
9737360	9738360	Yep.
9738360	9739360	I have to approve.
9739360	9740360	Of?
9740360	9741360	Of?
9741360	9745360	Well, don't ask that on the radio for God's sake.
9745360	9749360	If, if I didn't, I would have said something already.
9749360	9753360	And you, you Irene have been, you know, with your man a long time.
9753360	9754360	I've been with my man.
9754360	9757360	So if I disapproved, I would have said something a long time ago.
9757360	9759360	You would have bitch slapped the shit out of him.
9759360	9760360	I would have bitch slapped you.
9760360	9761360	All right.
9761360	9764360	Cause Irene makes no qualms if she dislikes somebody I'm dating.
9764360	9767360	Yes, we know.
9767360	9772360	Nellie was saying that she wants to get a second wife to do all the cleaning and cooking
9772360	9774360	because she doesn't do any of that.
9774360	9775360	You should.
9775360	9776360	All right.
9776360	9777360	Anyhow.
9777360	9778360	I'm sorry.
9778360	9779360	We got derailed talking.
9779360	9781360	If you become a gay man, that will be easy.
9781360	9784360	Cause you'll get a bunch of hags who will do that for you.
9784360	9786360	Why can't I have street hags?
9786360	9788360	Because there's no such thing as a straight hag.
9788360	9789360	Are you ridiculous?
9789360	9790360	I am going to pioneer this.
9790360	9792360	You can't have your cake and eat it too.
9792360	9793360	Yes I can.
9793360	9795360	What else do you do with cake?
9795360	9796360	You should take applications.
9796360	9798360	I don't know how many people like tacos.
9798360	9800360	Loki, you have a radio show.
9800360	9803360	You should solicit applications for some straight hags.
9803360	9809360	Cause see street hags, that's actual real hags and no one likes real hags.
9809360	9812360	You should just put on the application four tooth minimum.
9812360	9816360	No fat chicks.
9816360	9817360	All right.
9817360	9822360	Anyways, SSJ100 Matt says Loki needs to find a girl who's into airsofts.
9822360	9823360	Wait a minute though.
9823360	9824360	We're not trying to set him up on a date.
9824360	9825360	He's very happily married.
9825360	9827360	Him and Nellie get along fabulously.
9827360	9830360	He just wants a maid that works for free.
9830360	9833360	I just want someone that'll cook.
9833360	9835360	Well I cook, so that's fine.
9835360	9838360	Mainly clean and maybe walk around naked if she's hot.
9838360	9840360	Yeah, why not?
9840360	9842360	Is that so much to ask?
9842360	9843360	Geez.
9843360	9844360	It's not asking much.
9844360	9846360	I'm not asking to have sex with me or something.
9846360	9852360	No, you want someone for Nellie to nag so that she gets it out of her system before you get home.
9852360	9854360	Oh thank god.
9854360	9858360	I was like, that would be awesome.
9858360	9860360	Speaking of the airsoft stuff.
9860360	9862360	Doesn't even have to be a woman.
9862360	9866360	I haven't been good when it comes to the airsoft stuff.
9866360	9868360	Sorry, OLR Studio Drama.
9868360	9870360	You know how we tape in the garage basically, very thin wall.
9870360	9873360	I think I can hear the neighbor yelling at a dog or something.
9873360	9875360	We can hear it all the way here in the garage.
9875360	9877360	Oh my god, I hope he's not throwing his...
9877360	9880360	I think somebody just threw a taco across the street at the dog.
9880360	9882360	Really? I'll be back.
9882360	9884360	Anyways, I'm hungry.
9884360	9886360	Back to game news here.
9886360	9895360	We talked about last week how there was a game that possibly will get removed off of the app store relatively soon if Nintendo caught wind of it.
9895360	9897360	And that was the Game & Watch game.
9897360	9899360	Well now there's another Nintendo game.
9899360	9901360	Duck Hunt is now available for $1.
9901360	9903360	Damn, I forgot to download the Game & Watch game.
9903360	9904360	Shit.
9904360	9905360	Oh no.
9905360	9907360	Well I don't know if it might still be up there.
9907360	9909360	I mean, you just better check.
9909360	9914360	And then Duck Hunt is available now for a dollar.
9914360	9916360	One dollar.
9916360	9918360	Yes, one dollar.
9918360	9920360	And it has everything in the game.
9920360	9922360	Ducks and no annoying dog.
9922360	9925360	You move the cursor around and shoot ducks.
9925360	9927360	All for a dollar.
9927360	9928360	All for a dollar.
9928360	9930360	What a bargain.
9930360	9934360	But the laughing dog isn't in it, so what the hell's the point?
9934360	9937360	You shoot ducks.
9937360	9941360	Well, you know, maybe they didn't like the dog.
9941360	9943360	So, you know.
9943360	9944360	Who cares?
9944360	9949360	Hence the reason he prefaced that statement with annoying.
9949360	9952360	Alright, sorry, I'm looking for the Game & Watch games right now to see if they're there.
9952360	9953360	I don't think they're there.
9953360	9954360	What was the name of it?
9954360	9957360	Um, crap.
9957360	9961360	I searched for Game & Watch and didn't find anything.
9961360	9963360	Here, just one second, I can find it for you.
9963360	9968360	It is... it's not called Game & Watch, it's called...
9968360	9970360	Alright, you look while I talk about the next story.
9970360	9974360	Here it is, it's GW Chef, GW Parachute, GW Fire.
9974360	9975360	Just look for GW.
9975360	9977360	GW, thank you.
9977360	9981360	Alright, I'll look at that after I read you this story because this is pretty exciting, okay?
9981360	9984360	I love the Commodore 64.
9984360	9985360	Didn't you love the Commodore 64?
9985360	9986360	Oh my gosh, some of it, yeah.
9986360	9991360	Do you remember, if I start talking this, you are standing in front of a White House.
9991360	9992360	There is a mailbox here.
9992360	9994360	Is that Zork?
9994360	9996360	It is Zork, exactly right.
9996360	9998360	You have been eaten by a grew.
9998360	9999360	Oh, I knew you were going to do that.
9999360	10004360	Okay, and obviously Zork actually had a couple of other games that came out later, like Zork Grand & Quizzer.
10004360	10006360	They were kind of cute, funny games.
10006360	10010360	Well, apparently Zork is coming back as an MMO.
10010360	10011360	What?
10011360	10012360	Legends of Zork.
10012360	10014360	Wiggity what?
10014360	10017360	Joel Online is resurrecting the Zork franchise.
10017360	10018360	It's a game called Legends of Zork.
10018360	10021360	It's a casual, browser-based MMO.
10021360	10026360	I don't think it's up just yet, but they actually were interviewed by Grandma Sutra recently,
10026360	10029360	and they have mentioned that the game is going to feature microtransactions.
10029360	10032360	You can play it on the computer or the iPhone.
10032360	10034360	So that's kind of cool.
10034360	10035360	Sweet.
10035360	10036360	There you go.
10036360	10037360	What are you so upset about?
10037360	10038360	My phone just died.
10038360	10040360	Victoria's phone died, big drama.
10040360	10043360	Maybe we could bring it back to life.
10043360	10047360	I'm wondering how fast it's going to be before people get eaten by a grew.
10047360	10050360	I want to push Irene in front of a grew.
10050360	10055360	I'm going to push you off the edge of something from Impossible Mission.
10055360	10057360	No.
10057360	10060360	I almost did that for the classic game tonight, but it was Loki's turn.
10060360	10062360	Oh my gosh, I love that game so much.
10062360	10066360	It was Loki's turn, and I actually found another Commodore 64 game I wanted to do first before Impossible Mission.
10066360	10070360	You need to get the sound bites from that game and use it sometimes in here.
10070360	10072360	Stay a while.
10072360	10074360	Stay forever.
10074360	10075360	Hold on a minute.
10075360	10081360	I love that game so much, but I couldn't ever play it because I was only like 10.
10081360	10085360	You know, I never realized what it was he was saying in the beginning of the game.
10085360	10087360	Another visitor.
10087360	10088360	Yeah.
10088360	10089360	Visitor.
10089360	10091360	Stay a while.
10091360	10095360	Stay forever.
10095360	10096360	Anyhow.
10096360	10097360	What does he say?
10097360	10099360	Get him my robots or something.
10099360	10100360	Shut up.
10100360	10101360	Let's go on to the story.
10101360	10103360	Two more stories before we open up the Skyblind.
10103360	10105360	Hurry. Go. Do it.
10105360	10106360	Loki.
10106360	10109360	Well, there's some other fun stuff.
10109360	10112360	We talked about Klonoa coming out on the Wii.
10112360	10115360	It's actually been out on the Wii already in Japan.
10115360	10118360	And, of course, will be coming out over here.
10118360	10120360	Pretty soon, actually.
10120360	10125360	It's been announced that sometime in 2009 it will be available.
10125360	10128360	Or possibly April.
10128360	10130360	Then it might move. Who knows?
10130360	10131360	April 4th.
10131360	10132360	No, not April 4th.
10132360	10134360	Why not?
10134360	10138360	It's a great day to release stuff.
10138360	10140360	April 4th.
10140360	10144360	And, you know, when these games come out, you can rent them at Game.
10144360	10147360	That's right. Game is not here in the US.
10147360	10149360	So if you're looking confused, like, what the hell is Game?
10149360	10153360	It's actually a big competitor for the GameStop EB behemoth over in Europe.
10153360	10156360	And it's also in Australia and parts of Asia.
10156360	10159360	They actually are only in the business of selling new and used games right now.
10159360	10161360	But soon they are going to rent games.
10161360	10164360	They partnered up with a group called Swap Game.
10164360	10169360	So they're going to be offering folks over in the UK the option of paying a monthly subscription fee
10169360	10172360	that will allow them to rent two games at a time.
10172360	10174360	Like a GameStop employee.
10174360	10176360	Yeah, interesting business model, though.
10176360	10179360	Do you think that's going to make them a lot of money?
10179360	10181360	Rental, it couldn't hurt.
10181360	10184360	I mean, I think it, well...
10184360	10186360	Why not? A lot of those sites are making money.
10186360	10190360	If they're going to do, like, a mail service where they're going to mail out the games or something.
10190360	10195360	I don't know. I was just thinking if I ever opened up a game store, I'd want to name it Store.
10195360	10198360	You know, because let's just get it as broad as possible.
10198360	10199360	Store.
10199360	10202360	Good luck getting any new releases, though, from a place like this.
10202360	10207360	You know, I always wondered, like, because movie rental stores always rent games.
10207360	10210360	But that never made sense that game stores never rented games.
10210360	10213360	Like, you would think that's where you would go to do something like that.
10213360	10217360	I have a few customers of mine that actually rent games and they sell games, too.
10217360	10221360	So, it's something that they do, but it doesn't make them a lot of money.
10221360	10226360	Yeah, but no game stores here in America right now rent out games, do they?
10226360	10231360	Maybe if you want to consider GameCrazy, which basically is in a Hollywood video.
10231360	10235360	Yeah, I don't know. I think of GameCrazy as not, like, an independent thing.
10235360	10238360	I think of them as, like, part of Hollywood video.
10238360	10239360	Yeah.
10239360	10241360	I mean, you know, that's a movie rental place.
10241360	10244360	And GameStop wouldn't do it because they would cut into their used game sales.
10244360	10250360	Because, you know, why bother paying $30 for, you know, a $40 game or something like that
10250360	10253360	when they can rent it for $7 and beat it in a week or so.
10253360	10258360	Well, they could still do the buybacks of the used games and then rent out those games as a buyback.
10258360	10260360	And besides, those games they consider new.
10260360	10262360	Remember, they just put a little sticker on them.
10262360	10263360	I want to say this.
10263360	10267360	Misty in chat says, it sounds more immediate than GameFly if it weren't a mail-based return system.
10267360	10268360	And that's true.
10268360	10270360	And some people don't like to do the mail thing.
10270360	10272360	I mean, Netflix is huge, but they're still Blockbuster.
10272360	10275360	Because sometimes, you know, just like even last night, Victoria was over.
10275360	10278360	I was here, bored, done with WoW.
10278360	10279360	Let's watch a movie.
10279360	10283360	But, you know, I didn't want to wait for Netflix.
10283360	10285360	We tried looking on the PlayStation.
10285360	10286360	There was nothing we wanted to pay to Dallas.
10286360	10288360	I was like, well, maybe we should just go to Blockbuster and look.
10288360	10289360	Exactly.
10289360	10293360	You know, sometimes you want that instant gratification that even the mail won't get you.
10293360	10294360	Yeah.
10294360	10296360	No, that's kind of like, I don't know.
10296360	10301360	That's why I prefer having the monthly thing at Blockbuster where you can go in the store and rent it
10301360	10303360	as opposed to their total access online or whatever.
10303360	10304360	No.
10304360	10310360	I'm surprised and I'm sure it will happen that they haven't done game rentals available over, you know,
10310360	10312360	like Xbox Live or something like that.
10312360	10315360	You download the game and you have it for seven days or something.
10315360	10317360	Probably just a matter of time.
10317360	10322360	If they could make money off renting the game, then selling the game, that would be amazing.
10322360	10323360	That would be, yeah.
10323360	10324360	Smart business would be.
10324360	10325360	Oh, there you go.
10325360	10326360	Next.
10326360	10327360	All right.
10327360	10328360	That's it for stories tonight.
10328360	10329360	We're going to get into some last-minute stories.
10329360	10334360	But first, we want to take your calls on the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10334360	10338360	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you have the Skype program and want to talk to us that way.
10338360	10340360	Let's go to the phone and take some calls.
10340360	10342360	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10342360	10343360	Who's this?
10343360	10344360	Hey, it's Ronma.
10344360	10345360	What's up, everyone?
10345360	10346360	Hey, not much.
10346360	10347360	How you doing, Ronma?
10347360	10348360	I'm doing good.
10348360	10350360	Well, what is on your mind tonight?
10350360	10351360	So I got a couple of things I want to discuss.
10351360	10352360	All right.
10352360	10358360	Number one, the whole thing about EGM going down, I'm really sad by that because growing up,
10358360	10364360	that was one of three magazines I pretty much read like it was a religion to me.
10364360	10366360	I got a quick question for you, though.
10366360	10368360	When was the last time you bought EGM?
10368360	10370360	About a couple of months ago.
10370360	10371360	I still had a subscription.
10371360	10372360	Okay.
10372360	10373360	That's cool.
10373360	10375360	I'm just curious because I bet there's some people that are sad.
10375360	10380360	You know, I was sad to see EGM go, but I haven't bought it in like 10 years.
10380360	10381360	You know what I mean?
10381360	10384360	But I'm just kind of curious on what side of the fence you're on there.
10384360	10387360	So you were still a regular reader of it, so okay, you're sad to see it go.
10387360	10388360	Yeah, pretty much.
10388360	10392360	It was that, Die Hard, Game Fan, and Game Pro.
10392360	10395360	Those were the three magazines I read all throughout high school.
10395360	10396360	That was it for me.
10396360	10397360	Isn't Game Pro still around?
10397360	10402360	Yeah, that's still around, but Die Hard, Game Fan died after like two or three years.
10402360	10408360	I love that because at the time it was the only magazine available that had an in-depth review about in-port video games.
10408360	10410360	Hmm.
10410360	10412360	Weird, obscure fact about Game Pro.
10412360	10413360	I've got to say this.
10413360	10414360	This is what a nerd I am.
10414360	10416360	I don't know if you remember way back in the day.
10416360	10418360	If you read Game Pro for a long time, you'll remember this.
10418360	10424360	A long, long time ago, they had a contest to get like, I think it was 250 people,
10424360	10431360	or maybe it was 50 or 250 people that were going to be part of an exclusive club that would get to write reviews for games or something like that
10431360	10433360	for possible inclusion in the magazine or something.
10433360	10434360	This was a long time ago, so bear with me.
10434360	10435360	But this is what I remember.
10435360	10438360	I was in like the fourth grade or fifth grade or something, and I wrote in a letter.
10438360	10440360	I got picked as one of them.
10440360	10441360	Nice.
10441360	10442360	Wow, in fourth grade?
10442360	10444360	But they never did anything with it.
10444360	10445360	Boo.
10445360	10451360	I never got anything else other than the letter it said, you know, congratulations, you got selected, and then they never did anything with it.
10451360	10452360	So, this is funny.
10452360	10453360	Sorry, just a rant.
10453360	10455360	Whenever I think of Game Pro, I think of that.
10455360	10456360	Wow.
10456360	10459360	From when I was like, maybe it was a little late, like sixth grade, but I was young.
10459360	10460360	I know I was young.
10460360	10462360	Dork.
10462360	10463360	Well.
10463360	10464360	Yeah, kind of sad.
10464360	10471360	But, you know, some of those magazines are still around, but I sadly don't think this will be the last one to fold.
10471360	10482360	Well, I wouldn't be surprised if any more fold, because honestly, I mean, as many video gaming sites there are, it's getting to the point where it's like video gaming industry with news and stuff is getting very saturated.
10482360	10490360	It's like every other site, someone has a video game review site or blog or something like that, whereas me, I'm on opposite spectrum for what I cover.
10490360	10492360	It's kind of hard to get that kind of information.
10492360	10493360	Yeah.
10493360	10496360	What else did you want to talk about tonight?
10496360	10503360	You know, there was a couple of things I wanted to discuss, but I totally forgot, but I will do a brief review about The Last Remnant.
10503360	10505360	It's a game I just picked up yesterday.
10505360	10506360	Ah, yes, please do.
10506360	10517360	Basically, it plays like Final Fantasy XII, but when it comes to the battle sequences, it turns into a complete tactical style game, which I'm really enjoying a lot.
10517360	10523360	Really? What about the story? I've heard kind of mixed reviews on this game, so I'm kind of curious.
10523360	10534360	If I remember correctly, the story is about a brother and sister are going to meet up with their parents, but the sister is kidnapped, and he goes through his travels to find his sister,
10534360	10541360	and you're discovering what these last remnants are, or these relics for all types of different types of power that you can get.
10541360	10543360	Hmm.
10543360	10552360	And right now, I'm like four or five hours in, and just like a regular tactics game, if you're not fully prepared, you will get killed on the first quest.
10552360	10562360	Interesting. Huh. So is this something for like a hardcore tactical game fan only, or can anyone get into it, or what?
10562360	10571360	It's like this. If you're not really into tactics games, but there are some tactical games that are very simple, and you want something simple like that,
10571360	10577360	this would be a good game to pick up, but to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't pay the $59.99 retail price tag for it.
10577360	10582360	I got it on sale for $39. I would say, when you see it for $39, then pick it up then.
10582360	10584360	Gotcha.
10584360	10585360	Yeah, definitely.
10585360	10588360	Alright, well anything else you want to share with our listeners today?
10588360	10590360	Now remember one more thing, and I'll get out of here.
10590360	10591360	Yes.
10591360	10596360	Remember a long time ago, I sent in a letter, an email about which games I should get for my $360?
10596360	10600360	Um, yes, I think so.
10600360	10604360	Yeah, I actually picked up each of the games that you guys recommended for me.
10604360	10605360	Oh, really?
10605360	10609360	I finally got around to doing so.
10609360	10611360	Um, what did you think?
10611360	10615360	Okay, Blue Dragon, I'm still playing. I really enjoy that.
10615360	10621360	Loving Saints Row, and I'm loving Crackdown, and Marvel Ultimate Alliance is definitely a fun party game.
10621360	10624360	Hmm. Cool, cool.
10624360	10627360	Oh, you're good. I'm glad our reviews did some good.
10627360	10629360	Well, you guys are awesome. What can I tell you?
10629360	10632360	Oh, I do love you. It's almost like we pay you to say that.
10632360	10635360	Hmm. Just wait till you come out here again.
10635360	10640360	Uh huh. Alright, but hey, hopefully soon. It is one of my goals for 09 to get back to New York City.
10640360	10642360	It just probably won't happen until later in the year.
10642360	10643360	We'll be waiting.
10643360	10644360	Alright, have a good one.
10644360	10646360	Alright. Later. Bye.
10646360	10648360	Bye, Ranma.
10648360	10651360	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10651360	10656360	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. It is Jason coming to you with one less tooth in his mouth.
10656360	10662360	Well, hey, Jay. I know we've both been having dental drama this week, except yours sounds a little more severe, so I'm really sorry to hear it.
10662360	10667360	Yeah, mine went a little bit crazy, but my mouth's been fine ever since Thursday.
10667360	10670360	That's what it's all about then, so isn't it the worst?
10670360	10672360	Alright, I don't want to think about my mouth because then it's just going to hurt more.
10672360	10677360	By the way, I don't know if you've seen, have you seen what Deep Man's done for the OLR Beta?
10677360	10683360	Yeah, he was giving it to me. He showed me the link just a couple minutes ago, and I was futzing around with it.
10683360	10686360	It's a lot more attractive pretty instantly, I've got to say.
10686360	10695360	I know, I know. He did a nice job, so I've got to get you kids to work together behind the scenes to help make it happen so we can launch the new website, because I'm all excited now.
10695360	10701360	Alright, anyhow, we've got to show it to Jamie, though. She's not here tonight to give it her okay, but she'll love it, too. I know she will.
10701360	10704360	Oh, yeah, there's not going to be...
10704360	10710360	How can you look at the current site and go, oh, the current site's better? You really can, and the new site's pretty awesome.
10710360	10712360	I can agree with that.
10712360	10725360	Do you know, can I say the one piece of feedback I ended up giving Deep Man on the site was actually, he used a little Pac-Man graphic in the logo, and I was too afraid it looked too similar to the logo for another independent game podcast.
10725360	10733360	But I'm like, out of all the things I could have said need to be changed about the website, I'm like, that is nothing. The website's awesome. It's awesome.
10733360	10734360	Space Invaders?
10734360	10735360	Huh?
10735360	10736360	Pac-Man?
10736360	10738360	No, he changed it, I think, to a Space Invader now.
10738360	10741360	Okay, yeah, like I said, just a couple minutes.
10741360	10751360	The Pac-Man is right next to this little radio looking thing, and it looks way too similar to another show's logo, so I was like, eh, we don't want to do that. We don't want to ruffle any feathers.
10751360	10755360	I suggested a Space Invader, and I guess he ran with it. I haven't seen the new logo yet. Anyway...
10755360	10758360	I just completely lost you. Don't tell me I just completely lost you.
10758360	10765360	Well, we'll open up... No, I'm here. Hello? Can you hear us? Are we having internet issues going on?
10765360	10767360	Yes, I blame you and nobody else.
10767360	10776360	I did not dump him. Anyway, Jason, if you can hear me, why don't you tell us what you really called in for tonight before I hijacked website talk.
10776360	10781360	You can hear me now, right? Yeah, there's my echo. Okay, two questions.
10781360	10782360	Yes.
10782360	10792360	How long did... This is a question from Ryan, but she's too shy to get on the microphone because she's like that. How long did EGM2 last?
10792360	10798360	EGM2, that's right. They had a spinoff magazine for a little while, didn't they? Like they were trying...
10798360	10800360	That's retarded.
10800360	10805360	No, I remember. Famitsu was a weekly magazine, so they felt, I think for a short time there, that there was going to be like...
10805360	10810360	Didn't EGM2 come out like in the middle of the month or something to like offset it?
10810360	10814360	I never... She had it. FYI, you went off the air again.
10814360	10822360	It was not very long. Maybe a year. Maybe a year. So, just ignore the complaints about the stream and chat, Jason.
10822360	10824360	We're going to just keep going with the show even if they can't hear us.
10824360	10828360	Well, I have it in the background and I noticed a very specific loop, so...
10828360	10829360	Oh, sorry about that.
10829360	10830360	So about a year.
10830360	10839360	I think. I don't know. I'm definitely not the source. Let's see. Oh, no. Here we go. EGM2 ran from July 1994 to July 1998.
10839360	10841360	So it was actually four years. Wow.
10841360	10842360	Four years. Nice.
10842360	10844360	I was way off.
10844360	10850360	She had a subscription to both and I've never heard of it, but she wanted to know, so I am making you people do... or me.
10850360	10855360	There you have it. I got that from Wikipedia and I believe everything I read on Wikipedia, so there you go.
10855360	10859360	That's just because I'm older than Jason.
10859360	10866360	Thank you. I'm glad she hopped on the mic to clarify. What was the second question?
10866360	10872360	I have never heard of this before and I just kind of bumped across it, so I figured I'd ask it tonight.
10872360	10880360	Silent Hill 2 Restless Dreams. It's apparently something on the PS2. What?
10880360	10886360	They released a little later on. I don't know if it was on the PS2, but there was two versions of Silent Hill 2.
10886360	10893360	The second version, Restless Dreams, has an additional scenario where... don't you play as Maria or something?
10893360	10897360	It's really short. It's not a lot. It's not like you're getting a whole second game.
10897360	10902360	It's just like another little quick scenario that just gives some additional insight to the story.
10902360	10906360	So it was like a little bonus disc add-on that they released slightly later.
10906360	10910360	You got it. Like a bonus chapter. I wouldn't even think of it as a full game. It's very short.
10910360	10915360	It's not even really a game. I don't even think you really do much. You do one thing and that's...
10915360	10922360	Restless Dreams, I believe, was originally for the Xbox expansion and then I think they re-released it on the PS2 with the Restless Dreams thing.
10922360	10933360	Interesting. I went through and I replayed all the Metal Gear Solids and then that led up to the time that we got the PS3 and I played Metal Gear Solid 4 all the way through.
10933360	10945360	And our next run-through series of Silent Hill and I'm, barring the dental madness, I've been playing through Silent Hill 1 and I think I might be finishing that off tonight.
10945360	10951360	And since obviously Silent Hill 2 was the next one in line and I came across that, I had never heard of it before.
10951360	10955360	You'll like Silent Hill 2 a lot.
10955360	10965360	She was wondering if we were just going to skip the first one and as much as I want to because the game plays like hell and it really looks really bad.
10965360	10972360	I don't know if it's the PS2 doing something back compat but it has some really weird effects on our TV.
10972360	10981360	We were both thinking of just skipping the first one but she doesn't remember much of it and I fell asleep through some of it.
10981360	10985360	I wasn't the one who played it in the first place so I kind of wanted to go through it the whole way and see it.
10985360	10988360	I'm admittedly using a walkthrough all the way through it.
10988360	10993360	So that hint system is actually viable to some situations, Loki.
10993360	11006360	Yeah, I'm cheating all the way through it but I'm getting the entire story in the manner it was supposed to be presented to me and I'm playing the game to some extent so that's kind of enough for me.
11006360	11008360	Nice.
11008360	11019360	And you want to play through 1 because it's not necessary but it's good to play through 1 when you play through 3 because it'll kind of give some insight into 3's story also.
11019360	11022360	I watched Silent Hill the movie, what do I need to play the game for?
11022360	11024360	Because it's completely different.
11024360	11029360	Because if you're like 3 you'll think it's crap unless you give some insight to the series.
11029360	11034360	Alright, I have to admit, if I'd never played the games I would have thought the movie was kind of random.
11034360	11035360	You know what I mean?
11035360	11036360	No, I understand that.
11036360	11037360	What the hell is this pyramid thing?
11037360	11039360	Really, the movie was made for the fans.
11039360	11040360	Yeah, oh yeah.
11040360	11042360	I really wish they were due to see more.
11042360	11044360	It wasn't very well made on that same line.
11044360	11047360	What are the better video game movies, amazingly enough?
11047360	11050360	For real, my favorite video game movie, I ain't even going to lie.
11050360	11052360	I kind of want to watch it right now.
11052360	11054360	I do too, I've been wanting to watch it for like 3's.
11054360	11056360	We should go get it on Blu-Ray and then watch it.
11056360	11059360	Is it on Netflix? Because then we could party watch it or something like that.
11059360	11061360	Do they have that built in yet?
11061360	11064360	I don't think they have that feature built in yet.
11064360	11070360	We'd call each other and try to press play at the same time and do it that way or something, I don't know.
11070360	11072360	That'd be fun, do it on Justin.tv or something.
11072360	11074360	Well that worked too.
11074360	11084360	Jason, we've got to let you go, take some more calls, but thank you for all you do for the website too. Between you and Deep Man, 2009 is going to be the best year ever for our website. I'm so excited.
11084360	11086360	Sure as hell hope so, it's been long enough.
11086360	11092360	I am so excited because I'm all jazzed to write again for the website and I know TR has been wanting to do reviews.
11092360	11095360	We're actually going to have a functional website and I'm so excited I could tinkle.
11095360	11096360	You're jazzed.
11096360	11098360	Alright, so we're going to let you go Jason.
11098360	11107360	Give me a month to move as we're closing on Tuesday and then I'll do my best to be really, really on top of it.
11107360	11108360	You got it buddy.
11108360	11109360	Alright, take care.
11109360	11110360	Sweet.
11110360	11111360	Bye.
11111360	11112360	Bye.
11112360	11117360	Alright, dang, we've got calls coming in back to back. I think this is going to be the last one though because we're running kind of long tonight.
11117360	11119360	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
11119360	11121360	It's GS68.
11121360	11122360	Hi GS68.
11122360	11127360	I was going to say, yeah, we're at three hours between the two parts so far, so we're going to wrap up after this call.
11127360	11131360	So, sorry to all the callers that didn't get through, but we ran kind of long tonight.
11131360	11137360	I blame Victoria, I don't know why, but it's just she's here and she's just, you know, she's magical.
11137360	11138360	She's here and single and beautiful.
11138360	11139360	Alright.
11139360	11140360	Yeah, you two are welcome.
11140360	11143360	What's on your mind GS68?
11143360	11148360	So, about the whole instance and how the game pretty much played for you.
11148360	11149360	Yes.
11149360	11152360	There's always something like that in arcade games. It's called unlimited continues.
11152360	11157360	Yeah, but you have to feed it a quarter every time you want to continue.
11157360	11164360	Well, but at home, if you have free play, you just keep pressing start and you eventually get to the end of the game.
11164360	11166360	I mean, no need to use any skill.
11166360	11171360	Like playing the Ninja Turtles game on the Xbox, you can just get all the continues you want?
11171360	11175360	Yeah, or unlocking free play in Ikaruga.
11175360	11178360	In fact, you can even just let the bosses time out.
11178360	11186360	That's true, but you know, I also think of the old, you know what you're talking about, kind of reminds me of, could anyone, and I got to ask Loki this, I've got to ask Loki this.
11186360	11192360	Could you actually beat Contra on the NES without up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start?
11192360	11194360	No, it's fucking hard.
11194360	11198360	But that's the point though, you have to be good at it to, it can be done.
11198360	11202360	It's just that, you know, you just need, I need to play it more.
11202360	11206360	I need to play more to, you know, be able to learn the patterns and that kind of stuff.
11206360	11215360	And that's the whole point, it shouldn't be just like, oh look at this, it was super, cause even when we did that, we still didn't beat it, you know, it was fucking hard.
11215360	11223360	I don't know, the continues system was kind of an antiquated method of, to have gamers, you know, feed quarters into the machine, that's the whole point.
11223360	11230360	You have to start all over again, unless you put it in a quarter, you know, and then just carry it over onto consoles, you know, that's what people were used to.
11230360	11246360	If you're supposed to, like, if you want to learn the game, but, I mean, when you're trying to beat the game, I mean, it's, when you're trying to beat the game, I mean, you think continues is kind of like a good point.
11246360	11250360	Uh oh.
11250360	11257360	I don't know if the internet's acting up again, but you're kind of cutting in a little bit, in and out, so go ahead and say what you want to say.
11257360	11259360	And then what else?
11259360	11263360	Yeah, I was going to bring up DJ Max Black Square, which I got this week.
11263360	11274360	Um, it's alright, I guess, I mean, the songs are pretty good, and they're pretty hard, but I hate the club tour mode, cause some of the missions are, like, really stupid hard.
11274360	11283360	And then one feature, and there's Twitter features that really piss me off, one, sometimes, the...
11283360	11286360	Andy just dropped, oh no, you there?
11286360	11293360	I'm gonna ask real quick, we're having these weird problems tonight, is this the American version that you're talking about, or is this the new one that came out in Korea?
11293360	11295360	It's Korea.
11295360	11298360	Oh, my bad, okay, I didn't know.
11298360	11306360	Yeah, uh, basically sometimes the music will cut out and re-continue, but it will lag really badly.
11306360	11309360	Or it'll lag, like, a few seconds.
11309360	11317360	Um, are there any, like, crazy-ass videos like there were in the earlier games?
11317360	11328360	Sure, the pissing me off is this autocorrect feature, basically, if you press the wrong node to play a node, you still get a vast 100% for it.
11328360	11333360	I mean, you get 80% of the score, but you still get 100% of the judgement.
11333360	11340360	Is it just me, or is the arcade DJ Max and the PSP one kind of, like, really different because of the whole touch element?
11340360	11341360	They're really different.
11341360	11342360	Um, well, obviously they're different.
11342360	11345360	I wonder why they don't do DJ Max on the DS.
11345360	11347360	They are, and this is the arcade one.
11347360	11349360	Aha! Aha!
11349360	11354360	Arcade one, like, sometimes...
11354360	11358360	Okay, we're having too many phone problems, so I'm gonna go ahead and wrap up the call.
11358360	11362360	Sorry, GS68, I don't know if it's your internet connection or our internet connection, but something's up.
11362360	11368360	Um, so, yeah, um, DJ Max, you know, it's one of the series I've been...
11368360	11373360	One of my friends is really into it and keeps begging me to check it out, so I probably will at some point.
11373360	11375360	At least when it comes out in America.
11375360	11378360	But I do want to try this arcade version that's at Sunnyvale Golf Land.
11378360	11380360	Hopefully it's not gone.
11380360	11385360	I guess GS68 was saying in chat earlier that it looks like it's probably gonna be gone by the time I get there.
11385360	11391360	So that would suck, because I guess it's in this weird beta test or whatever, so we'll see.
11391360	11394360	Anyhow, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us before we wrap up the show?
11394360	11397360	Yes, that's what I've been doing.
11397360	11399360	Um, some interesting ones.
11399360	11403360	Apple has actually rejected a game from Utesato.
11403360	11406360	You remember him from the Seaman series.
11406360	11414360	Well, he had a game coming out, I think it was like Seaman 2, on the iPhone.
11414360	11416360	It was Gabo.
11416360	11420360	It was a spiritual successor to Seaman, but with a caveman instead.
11420360	11428360	And unfortunately they said, due to unpleasant gameplay, they axed the game and they're not allowed to put it on the App Store.
11428360	11434360	I heard about that. That's so weird, because there's a lot of crap on the App Store, so I'm kind of surprised, actually.
11434360	11437360	And which is why apples suck.
11437360	11439360	You just had to work that in there, didn't you?
11439360	11440360	Yes, I did.
11440360	11444360	This isn't really a gaming story, but it has a game addict with it.
11444360	11457360	Apparently there's a game addict in Beijing who was 23 years old and was rushed to a hospital after swallowing five pieces of saw blades in order to attempt to commit suicide.
11457360	11466360	And apparently he had been talking incoherently about how to win his favorite computer games after being sent to a Beijing hospital ICU.
11466360	11475360	Yeah, that was another one of those cases where he was a gamer, and that's about the extent that it was related to video games. This guy had issues way beyond video games.
11475360	11479360	Well, I just want to talk about swallowing saw blades, and that was kind of neat. That's pretty extreme.
11479360	11481360	That is pretty extreme. I'll give you that.
11481360	11488360	House of the Dead Overkill is actually getting an official gun attachment for the Wii.
11488360	11490360	Only in Europe, though.
11490360	11502360	Apparently Amazon UK is taking pre-orders on it right now. It's supposed to ship on February 13th, and it will be priced for 12.99 euros.
11502360	11504360	Or pounds or something like that. I think it's euros.
11504360	11517360	And they're also going to have a big bang box set that's going to have both that and two of those guns, which they're calling the hand cannons, and they look like pretty sweet guns.
11517360	11519360	So that's kind of cool.
11519360	11532360	And this is pretty big news. Final Fantasy 13 is coming to Japan in 2009. Of course, we'll be making it out overseas and everywhere else April 2010.
11532360	11545360	So April 2010 is the earliest that we'll see Final Fantasy 13. However, I hope that we'll see it a lot sooner, because I will be importing the Blu-ray special edition for Advent Children.
11545360	11553360	I want that so bad, but if we have to wait until 2010, then we have to wait until 2010. I guess it's not surprising. It's just a little disappointing.
11553360	11559360	Especially because we do these things on the OLR forums, the annual predictions.
11559360	11563360	Rob with Two Bees does this thread every year, and he does a really good job tabulating and everything.
11563360	11566360	And everybody makes their predictions for the year, and we see how many of them come true.
11566360	11570360	I've already lost, like, on two of my predictions. I said there'd be a new Rock Band game this year.
11570360	11577360	There's not going to be, they've already said, because of the Beatles game, which makes sense. I should have been smarter and known that, that they don't need a new Rock Band game with the Beatles game.
11577360	11585360	And also, now this. I said that Final Fantasy 13 would finally come out this Christmas, and now it looks like it's going to be next year.
11585360	11588360	I might get half credit for the Japanese release date, though.
11588360	11595360	Yeah, and like I said, I'll try to import the Blu-ray for Advent Children, because it's going to have a demo on it.
11595360	11599360	Yeah, I totally want to check that out, too. I might even import it for that. We'll see.
11599360	11603360	Because the demo's supposed to be like two hours long, they said. Which is pretty crazy.
11603360	11617360	CS09! Microsoft has been, apparently was talking to somebody, that they were saying that they were looking to increase the 100 friend limit on Xbox Live.
11617360	11618360	Yes, thank God.
11618360	11633360	Apparently because it was in place for the original Xbox, it was coded into games, but now since they've moved past the Xbox, they can go ahead and raise it. So maybe in a future update, they will do that. Which would be awesome.
11633360	11650360	And let's see here. Also, there's going to be a special edition Final Fantasy VII Advent Children PS3 coming out in Japan. It's in cloud black, and it's got a nice little symbol there etched into the front of it.
11650360	11668360	It's one of the 160GB PS3s. It's got a Final Fantasy XIII trail version set, which is with the Final Fantasy XIII demo, I guess. And then Final Fantasy VII Advent Children complete Blu-ray disc set.
11668360	11691360	Which would be available for 49,980 yen, approximately $551 US. Very cool. And apparently, those people interested in purchasing Final Fantasy VII Advent Children complete, it does have an English language option.
11691360	11705360	So fuck yeah, I'm importing that shit. Awesome. And this is some funny stuff. Duke Nukem Critical Hour is coming along quite well, says 3D Realms. And you may not remember what these are, actually.
11705360	11729360	Critical Hour was the game that they're putting out on the PSP. It's a new game trilogy, I guess. And they're also having some on the DS as well. But all I have to say is finish Duke Nukem forever first! Stop going on to new things! Finish one, then you get to work on new games.
11729360	11750360	Hey, speaking of Final Fantasy XIII, not to backtrack, but I am. Did you see the new character that was announced this week? Yeah, he's pretty cool looking. Yeah, I know. A lot of people were giving it crap. He's Lando. He looks fine. He looks pretty cool. I love the cute little chocobo he has with him. That's going to be awesome. Anyway, sorry, I just wanted to back, because we didn't mention that during the show either, so I just wanted to throw that out there.
11750360	11773360	And then the last thing, EA is prepping a new game called Spore Hero, and of course it will be related to Spore. It's coming out on Wii and DS. Alright, awesome. We're going to go ahead and start to wrap up the show, then, and get everybody's final thought and get on out of here. Unfortunately, our stream is crashing left and right, and we're starting to lose listeners because of it, so I think that's a sign that we're probably running too long.
11773360	11793360	So we're going to go ahead and wrap up for tonight, but first we're going to go get around everybody's final thought, but I do want to say thank you very much for listening to Orange Lawn Radio this week. If you've enjoyed what you've heard, please tell two friends about our show. You know, it's how we spread the word about our show and get it out there, the little program that we do. So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought. Victoria left the studio to go charge her phone.
11793360	11809360	I'm Victoria, and I'm young and I'm single, and I'm sexy. I want to thank her for being on the show tonight and giving her opinion and everything, especially in the first part of the show, although she started to tune out during the second half of the show. Shut up.
11809360	11825360	So thank you, Victoria. Rice Princess, thank you for being here tonight. Thanks. And you said quite a bit tonight, especially in regards to Nintendo, so thank you for your input as always. And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight? I want to know when the website's going live.
11825360	11839360	The website, I don't know. Don't get too excited. It might not be until next month. I got to make sure Deep Man and Jason get it worked out, but we will try to get it up fast. I will do whatever I can to get it working.
11839360	11855360	All right. Loki, your final thought tonight? It's cold in here. I know, I haven't been running the heater. It's getting cold in here. Sorry. And my final thought is I need some Auragel. Boo hoo, cry.
11855360	11875360	All right. That's it. Thank you guys once again for staying with us all night long, especially you live listeners that have suffered through several outages tonight. Thank you guys as always for your support of Orange Lounge Radio. You know we would just not do this if it weren't for you guys. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Have an amazing week. We'll see you again next week with Jamie back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
